00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
it takes a longer time to kill somebody

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:06.410 
it takes a longer time to kill somebody
then<00:04:01.310> you<00:04:02.310> will<00:04:02.579> realize<00:04:02.639> that<00:04:05.030> more<00:04:06.030> bullets

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
then you will realize that more bullets

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.080 
then you will realize that more bullets
that<00:04:06.510> are<00:04:06.569> hitting<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:06.930> body<00:04:07.700> leaves<00:04:08.700> room

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
that are hitting the body leaves room

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.900 
that are hitting the body leaves room
for<00:04:09.120> a<00:04:10.049> prom<00:04:10.470> for<00:04:10.680> it<00:04:10.739> to<00:04:10.950> hit<00:04:11.250> detection<00:04:11.400> and

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
for a prom for it to hit detection and

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.030 
for a prom for it to hit detection and
here's<00:04:12.090> why<00:04:12.299> because<00:04:12.660> if<00:04:13.380> two<00:04:13.650> people<00:04:13.950> are

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
here's why because if two people are

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.039 
here's why because if two people are
playing<00:04:14.340> then<00:04:15.060> that's<00:04:15.269> more<00:04:15.569> bullets<00:04:15.930> that

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
playing then that's more bullets that

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.500 
playing then that's more bullets that
have<00:04:16.260> to<00:04:16.440> register<00:04:16.769> to<00:04:16.950> kill<00:04:17.340> somebody<00:04:17.639> which

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
have to register to kill somebody which

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.870 
have to register to kill somebody which
leads<00:04:18.959> to<00:04:19.140> the<00:04:19.260> problem<00:04:19.769> of<00:04:19.859> latency<00:04:20.519> and

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
leads to the problem of latency and

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.700 
leads to the problem of latency and
that's<00:04:21.810> why<00:04:21.959> people<00:04:22.169> are<00:04:22.349> saying<00:04:22.560> look

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
that's why people are saying look

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.830 
that's why people are saying look
there's<00:04:23.039> a<00:04:23.130> handy

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
there's a handy

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.010 
there's a handy
problem<00:04:24.380> look<00:04:24.710> um<00:04:24.860> it's<00:04:25.010> not<00:04:25.070> killing<00:04:25.550> him

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
problem look um it's not killing him

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.990 
problem look um it's not killing him
he's<00:04:27.020> got<00:04:27.230> a<00:04:27.260> mother<00:04:27.530> fuckers<00:04:27.980> got<00:04:28.250> jargon<00:04:28.880> I

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
he's got a mother fuckers got jargon I

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.909 
he's got a mother fuckers got jargon I
on<00:04:29.240> first<00:04:29.810> of<00:04:29.990> all<00:04:30.110> it's<00:04:30.260> already<00:04:30.470> programmed

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
on first of all it's already programmed

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.310 
on first of all it's already programmed
in<00:04:31.070> nobody<00:04:31.699> got<00:04:31.820> stopping<00:04:32.270> power<00:04:32.449> and<00:04:32.810> when

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
in nobody got stopping power and when

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.200 
in nobody got stopping power and when
five<00:04:33.620> bullets<00:04:34.040> are<00:04:34.130> trying<00:04:34.460> to<00:04:34.639> hit<00:04:34.820> a<00:04:34.850> person

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
five bullets are trying to hit a person

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.020 
five bullets are trying to hit a person
and<00:04:35.660> two<00:04:36.290> people<00:04:36.500> have<00:04:36.650> a<00:04:36.800> connection<00:04:37.220> a<00:04:37.550> and<00:04:37.820> B

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
and two people have a connection a and B

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.090 
and two people have a connection a and B
are<00:04:38.060> shooting<00:04:38.510> at<00:04:38.630> each<00:04:38.660> other<00:04:38.930> then<00:04:39.740> fuck

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
are shooting at each other then fuck

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.710 
are shooting at each other then fuck
yeah<00:04:40.370> of<00:04:40.760> course<00:04:41.000> you're<00:04:41.150> gonna<00:04:41.270> have<00:04:41.449> the<00:04:41.540> hit

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
yeah of course you're gonna have the hit

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.629 
yeah of course you're gonna have the hit
detection<00:04:41.870> problem<00:04:42.470> because<00:04:43.040> it<00:04:43.130> takes<00:04:43.310> twice

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
detection problem because it takes twice

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.260 
detection problem because it takes twice
as<00:04:43.699> many<00:04:43.970> boats<00:04:44.270> to<00:04:44.419> kill<00:04:44.630> somebody<00:04:44.900> so<00:04:46.030> if<00:04:47.030> the

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
as many boats to kill somebody so if the

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.810 
as many boats to kill somebody so if the
packets<00:04:47.810> are<00:04:48.080> going<00:04:48.560> between<00:04:48.740> your<00:04:49.310> servers

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
packets are going between your servers

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.840 
packets are going between your servers
and<00:04:50.590> it<00:04:51.590> takes<00:04:51.889> longer<00:04:52.250> to<00:04:52.340> kill<00:04:52.550> somebody

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
and it takes longer to kill somebody

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.689 
and it takes longer to kill somebody
then<00:04:53.750> you<00:04:53.900> have<00:04:54.139> to<00:04:54.290> hit<00:04:54.500> every<00:04:54.560> marker<00:04:55.400> to<00:04:55.520> get

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
then you have to hit every marker to get

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.210 
then you have to hit every marker to get
that<00:04:55.940> or<00:04:56.120> else<00:04:56.330> that<00:04:56.600> person<00:04:57.020> is<00:04:57.200> going<00:04:57.830> to<00:04:57.919> be

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
that or else that person is going to be

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.990 
that or else that person is going to be
that<00:04:59.030> person<00:04:59.330> has<00:04:59.900> health<00:05:00.380> regeneration<00:05:01.000> you

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
that person has health regeneration you

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.490 
that person has health regeneration you
don't<00:05:02.150> have<00:05:02.360> to<00:05:02.600> go<00:05:02.750> to<00:05:02.810> a<00:05:02.900> crate<00:05:03.169> like<00:05:03.320> I'm

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
don't have to go to a crate like I'm

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.969 
don't have to go to a crate like I'm
bleeding<00:05:03.860> right<00:05:04.010> now<00:05:04.270> mm-hmm<00:05:05.290> excuse<00:05:06.290> me<00:05:06.440> you

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
bleeding right now mm-hmm excuse me you

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:09.219 
bleeding right now mm-hmm excuse me you
just<00:05:07.190> have<00:05:07.340> to<00:05:07.370> you<00:05:08.360> run<00:05:08.660> around<00:05:08.930> and<00:05:09.020> you<00:05:09.110> get

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
just have to you run around and you get

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.610 
just have to you run around and you get
your<00:05:09.410> life<00:05:09.650> back<00:05:09.850> and<00:05:11.020> so<00:05:12.020> when<00:05:12.200> you<00:05:12.320> shoot

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
your life back and so when you shoot

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.440 
your life back and so when you shoot
somebody<00:05:12.889> hit<00:05:13.160> them<00:05:13.250> two<00:05:13.430> bullets<00:05:13.790> and<00:05:13.970> they

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
somebody hit them two bullets and they

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.180 
somebody hit them two bullets and they
step<00:05:14.810> to<00:05:14.930> the<00:05:15.020> left<00:05:15.169> and<00:05:15.440> I'll<00:05:15.770> sudden<00:05:16.100> there

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
step to the left and I'll sudden there

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.370 
step to the left and I'll sudden there
might<00:05:16.370> be<00:05:16.400> a<00:05:16.520> latency<00:05:16.850> issue<00:05:17.380> automatically

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
might be a latency issue automatically

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.230 
might be a latency issue automatically
that<00:05:18.770> person<00:05:19.160> regains<00:05:19.490> health<00:05:19.789> and<00:05:20.120> you're

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
that person regains health and you're

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.520 
that person regains health and you're
like<00:05:20.389> getting<00:05:20.630> a<00:05:20.660> hit<00:05:20.780> your<00:05:20.930> marker<00:05:21.229> it's<00:05:21.380> not

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
like getting a hit your marker it's not

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.710 
like getting a hit your marker it's not
registering<00:05:21.710> so<00:05:22.610> it's<00:05:22.729> like<00:05:22.789> fucking<00:05:23.180> twice

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
registering so it's like fucking twice

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.520 
registering so it's like fucking twice
as<00:05:23.960> many<00:05:24.139> bullets<00:05:25.330> look<00:05:26.330> I'm<00:05:26.539> not<00:05:26.780> hating<00:05:27.080> on

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
as many bullets look I'm not hating on

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.250 
as many bullets look I'm not hating on
black<00:05:28.220> ops<00:05:28.490> I'm<00:05:29.330> just<00:05:29.630> giving<00:05:30.139> you<00:05:30.229> a

black ops I'm just giving you a

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
black ops I'm just giving you a
perspective<00:05:30.830> of<00:05:32.289> an<00:05:33.289> opinion<00:05:33.970> that<00:05:34.970> might<00:05:35.360> be

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
perspective of an opinion that might be

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.520 
perspective of an opinion that might be
what<00:05:37.280> is<00:05:37.460> the<00:05:37.550> problem<00:05:37.850> in<00:05:38.240> there<00:05:39.020> you<00:05:39.410> don't

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
what is the problem in there you don't

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.310 
what is the problem in there you don't
really<00:05:39.770> realize<00:05:40.070> it<00:05:40.550> you<00:05:40.669> don't<00:05:40.880> I<00:05:41.270> mean<00:05:41.690> like
