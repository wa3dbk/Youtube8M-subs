00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.240
 i'm in center is something the neighborhood of johannesburg time heals a hotel 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.240
 the Dutch national team will stay during the football World Cup 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:10.789
 Mr. 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:12.629
 get it 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:13.459
 the hand 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:14.719

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:16.009

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.929
 franc 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:22.800
 the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.800
 this year 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:27.880
 I already like it here 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.199
 but what do you think of the who manager app store when it actually contains that orange 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:35.199
 his hotel is staying 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.740
 well 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.560
 he went the dax 10 nothing the bar of b 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.560
 become normal 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.600
 The problems must stand for term 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.180
 and there will be the selection and then steps at the maternity chair do not fall 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.180
 something that we do not go into in such a way 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.210
 passwords, this first mix attracts a better chance for the German team 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.330
 Experience to dress up the file that position 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.530
 but so it is the hotel turn for one 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.310
 for the dutch national score it sounds like you are sending it wrong vs 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.750
 tax calc steam 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.620
 batouwe wagner succeed nevertheless he had an interest 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.860
 I saw what goes on with his tent then the piste commercial the district 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.530
 piste stab speak read in south africa 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.670
 after a few 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.360
 hospital that the bells had nothing and he stopped at an exceptional me 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.060
 say 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.180
 must be works 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.180
 and where can that be better than here 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.010
 well as you see that poor country is not in it and this is the place where the 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.010
 players in the netherlands can already keep themselves fit for the world cup 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.710
 fisherman 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.630
 annual that is also possible and of course you do that in the swimming pool 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.140
 after the temperature of the pool water makes sense it is fair 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.890
 just to hope that there won't be too many women because we know how 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.890
 it ended in 1970 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.430
 inquire teaches that these stand where each other for leo in line the scope of a 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.099
 part the team will have doubts will experience top time 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.379
 stijn 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.379
 the 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.530
 also arjen robben that is unfortunately really different on them ditch have to practice 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.530
 although Westra also likes the real thing they will of course love it too 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.329
 previously worked after dinner 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:44.119
 leaflet states that db I miss goal 

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:45.879
 who else is clean 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.359
 only unemployment in the front and a rick and a silo 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:53.509
 there quartz sand in the city players in this class particle a few a unique 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:55.999
 how those are three poles there it is ready 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:58.429
 which can 

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:00.759
 the conflict did not end much of it 

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:03.759
 so we also went to a japanese restaurant 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:13.209
 I quote from the civic whose hilton hotel 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.909
 and this is probably the place we find out every night 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:18.579
 dinner on his own 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.919
 The sushi leaks probably caught in Katwijk at least if it did 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:22.969
 lies with him 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.709
 Fortunately, well spent is not just merger issues 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.049
 sales 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.169
 frank we have the cook of the hotel and you also with the netherlands 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:35.339
 so many probably a bag that the participants come over you 

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:38.799
 yes it is something grandiose near it and of course it never expected 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.509
 certainly less in the beginning 

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:43.759
 if you then of course get to hear that your own dutch team you 

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:47.019
 If it comes to it, then of course it is fantastic 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.409
 There are still some typical Dutch things that eline iron object for 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:50.830
 the team 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.230
 after god's approval is the rightful winner 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.800
 wanted but it was not disclosed to get the series but have that 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.769
 medics that you have to take yourself 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.359
 the peanut butter and 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:05.819
 now counting offer I mean those are the things we just do with this 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.219
 so for that matter we are going to the right trench 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:13.749
 way right direction actually when the team arrives at the food and so on 

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:17.599
 pavel nedved the gingerbread tables say that there will be a small one 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:20.599
 things to take with you 

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:26.249
 after being able to play finally start enjoying a well-earned rest how 

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:29.419
 Is it actually the most important thing in the world? 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.419
 the bedroom 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:37.550
 both players and the trainers of it end up in the site 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.929
 Dutch team will have a well-earned night's rest 

00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:40.539
 to grab 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:44.020
 This is the bed where trainer Bert van Marwijk starts to devise his tactics 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.020
 for the upcoming matches 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:55.849
 belgium is in recent times john heitinga will soon have a big message 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:56.819
 to deliver 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:59.819
 and I can tell you and this is fair 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.300
 this is so yolanthe cabau van kasbergen can do next week 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:11.229
 it will not be the hotel 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:12.460
 outside on the field 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.360
 there it must happen
