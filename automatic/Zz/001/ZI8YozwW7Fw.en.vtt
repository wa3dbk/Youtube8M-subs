00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.440 

computer<00:01:06.740> to<00:01:07.740> where<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.010> when<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.610> lift<00:01:09.300> this

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
computer to where you when you lift this

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.620 
computer to where you when you lift this
thing<00:01:09.510> up<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:10.050> grabs<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.590> whole<00:01:10.710> case<00:01:11.040> and

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
thing up it grabs the whole case and

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.750 
thing up it grabs the whole case and
you're<00:01:12.630> breaking<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.200> heatsink<00:01:13.770> away<00:01:14.520> from

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
you're breaking the heatsink away from

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.690 
you're breaking the heatsink away from
the<00:01:14.880> CPU<00:01:15.390> now<00:01:16.050> this<00:01:16.290> solution<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.220> here<00:01:17.400> should

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
the CPU now this solution in here should

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.359 
the CPU now this solution in here should
be<00:01:17.820> replaced<00:01:18.119> every<00:01:18.630> time<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.590> break<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:20.010> I've

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
be replaced every time you break it I've

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.190 
be replaced every time you break it I've
never<00:01:20.580> had<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> problem<00:01:21.330> as<00:01:21.450> far<00:01:21.660> as<00:01:21.780> putting<00:01:21.990> it

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
never had a problem as far as putting it

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.330 
never had a problem as far as putting it
back<00:01:22.320> down<00:01:22.590> there<00:01:22.770> make<00:01:22.979> sure<00:01:23.009> there's<00:01:23.310> good

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
back down there make sure there's good

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.859 
back down there make sure there's good
seal<00:01:23.759> but<00:01:24.509> really<00:01:25.080> as<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.229> technician<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:26.040> should

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
seal but really as a technician I should

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.990 
seal but really as a technician I should
be<00:01:27.869> replacing<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.310> will<00:01:29.580> replace<00:01:29.940> it

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.180 
all right so it's not a nice quick fix
when<00:02:03.720> you<00:02:03.840> put<00:02:04.140> this<00:02:04.259> back<00:02:04.530> down<00:02:04.560> once<00:02:05.069> you

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
when you put this back down once you

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.490 
when you put this back down once you
tighten<00:02:05.399> those<00:02:05.580> two<00:02:05.640> screws<00:02:05.819> down<00:02:06.349> it's<00:02:07.349> going

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
tighten those two screws down it's going

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.559 
tighten those two screws down it's going
to<00:02:07.590> just<00:02:07.920> going<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.190> create<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.429> good<00:02:08.640> seal<00:02:08.970> so

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
to just going to create a good seal so

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.150 
to just going to create a good seal so
you<00:02:09.660> grab<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.869> Phillips<00:02:10.440> head<00:02:10.560> screwdrivers

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
you grab a Phillips head screwdrivers

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.710 
you grab a Phillips head screwdrivers
what<00:02:11.310> you're<00:02:11.430> going<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.580> need<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.910> screw<00:02:12.599> that

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
what you're going to need and screw that

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.490 
what you're going to need and screw that
all<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.959> way<00:02:13.050> down

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
all the way down

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.280 
all the way down
I<00:02:13.640> have<00:02:14.640> tried<00:02:14.880> taken<00:02:15.360> out<00:02:15.480> taken<00:02:15.959> apart

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
I have tried taken out taken apart

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.930 
I have tried taken out taken apart
different<00:02:16.680> ways<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.160> have<00:02:17.280> weighed<00:02:17.459> that<00:02:17.670> but

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
different ways to have weighed that but

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.900 
different ways to have weighed that but
I<00:02:18.150> tried<00:02:18.930> pulling<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.500> wide<00:02:20.220> apart<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:20.790> all

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
I tried pulling it a wide apart and all

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.850 
I tried pulling it a wide apart and all
that<00:02:21.120> it's<00:02:21.900> just<00:02:21.930> easier<00:02:22.380> just<00:02:22.410> pull<00:02:22.740> the

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
that it's just easier just pull the

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.250 
that it's just easier just pull the
thing<00:02:23.040> all<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.310> way<00:02:23.340> up<00:02:23.840> again<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.050> that's

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
thing all the way up again so that's

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.089 
thing all the way up again so that's
down<00:02:25.470> there<00:02:25.620> real<00:02:25.830> good

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
down there real good

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.670

it's<00:02:26.370> got<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.640> good<00:02:26.880> seal<00:02:27.209> just<00:02:27.990> anchor<00:02:28.410> down<00:02:28.530> to

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
it's got a good seal just anchor down to

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.199 
it's got a good seal just anchor down to
the<00:02:28.770> motherboard<00:02:29.040> actually<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:29.940> case

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
the motherboard actually to the case

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.780 
the motherboard actually to the case
underneath<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:30.959> that's<00:02:31.590> as<00:02:31.980> easy<00:02:32.130> as<00:02:32.400> that

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
underneath and that's as easy as that

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.400 
underneath and that's as easy as that
