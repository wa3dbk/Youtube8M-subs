00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.720

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.120

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.980

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.930

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.740

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.159
 saved too much and then the 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.110
 reduced interest rates will lower the interest rate 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.520
 lowered so that spared no more
