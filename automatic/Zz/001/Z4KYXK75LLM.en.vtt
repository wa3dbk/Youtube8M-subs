00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670

this back to school notebook punch so

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.230 
this back to school notebook punch so
it's<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> hole<00:01:26.369> punch<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.880> ruler<00:01:27.090> at

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
it's like a hole punch and a ruler at

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.219 
it's like a hole punch and a ruler at
the<00:01:27.360> same<00:01:27.509> time<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.840> can<00:01:27.869> throw<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.140> and

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
the same time so you can throw it and

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.590 
the same time so you can throw it and
like<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.409> binder<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.159> I'd<00:01:30.060> really<00:01:30.299> like<00:01:30.450> this

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
like a binder and I'd really like this

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.850 
like a binder and I'd really like this
instead<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.900> like<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.140> big<00:01:31.320> bulky<00:01:31.710> hole

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
instead of like the big bulky hole

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.440 
instead of like the big bulky hole
punches<00:01:32.310> because<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.939> takes<00:01:33.090> up<00:01:33.329> like

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
punches because that takes up like

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.840 
punches because that takes up like
literally<00:01:33.810> no<00:01:34.049> space<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.680> then<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.189> bought<00:01:35.400> six

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
sharpies which is just kind of

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.230

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:31.949 
the first thing is just as hamper which

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:33.589 
the first thing is just as hamper which
i<00:03:32.040> got<00:03:32.189> from<00:03:32.220> ikea<00:03:32.760> so<00:03:32.939> it's<00:03:33.060> like<00:03:33.150> a<00:03:33.180> pop<00:03:33.449> up

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
i got from ikea so it's like a pop up

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.000 
i got from ikea so it's like a pop up
hamper<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:33.989> it<00:03:34.079> just<00:03:34.260> has<00:03:34.349> like<00:03:34.379> the<00:03:34.709> silver

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010

around<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.400> outside<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:36.060> i<00:03:36.569> thought<00:03:36.689> this

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
around the outside and i thought this

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.020 
around the outside and i thought this
would<00:03:36.959> be<00:03:36.989> good<00:03:37.290> just<00:03:37.590> because<00:03:37.790> what<00:03:38.790> I'm<00:03:38.879> not

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
would be good just because what I'm not

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.490 
would be good just because what I'm not
using<00:03:39.269> it<00:03:39.479> I<00:03:39.599> can<00:03:39.810> just<00:03:39.930> fold<00:03:40.079> it<00:03:40.199> down<00:03:40.319> like

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
using it I can just fold it down like

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.020 
using it I can just fold it down like
this<00:03:40.620> and<00:03:40.680> just<00:03:40.949> slide<00:03:41.189> it<00:03:41.340> away<00:03:41.549> so<00:03:41.609> you<00:03:41.909> don't

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
this and just slide it away so you don't

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.309 
this and just slide it away so you don't
really<00:03:42.090> have<00:03:42.269> to<00:03:42.359> see<00:03:42.569> it<00:03:42.689> and<00:03:42.840> it's<00:03:42.989> kind<00:03:43.259> of

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
really have to see it and it's kind of

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.140 
really have to see it and it's kind of
short<00:03:43.560> so<00:03:43.829> it's<00:03:43.979> not<00:03:44.069> like<00:03:44.250> taking<00:03:44.790> up<00:03:44.879> a<00:03:44.939> ton

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
short so it's not like taking up a ton

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.300 
short so it's not like taking up a ton
of<00:03:45.180> space<00:03:45.419> even<00:03:45.720> when<00:03:46.079> it<00:03:46.169> is<00:03:46.259> open<00:03:46.650> so<00:03:47.159> really

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
of space even when it is open so really

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.089 
of space even when it is open so really

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
shower shoes so I got these purple ones

a pair of pink ones and some blue ones
as<00:03:54.840> well<00:03:54.870> because<00:03:55.470> it<00:03:55.889> is<00:03:56.400> like<00:03:56.699> the<00:03:56.970> community

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
as well because it is like the community

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.869 
as well because it is like the community
showers<00:03:57.900> and<00:03:58.199> you<00:03:59.159> never<00:03:59.340> know<00:03:59.519> what<00:03:59.639> kind<00:03:59.759> of

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
showers and you never know what kind of

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:01.189 
showers and you never know what kind of
germs<00:04:00.120> are<00:04:00.299> there<00:04:00.419> so<00:04:00.599> you<00:04:00.659> have<00:04:00.870> to<00:04:01.019> make<00:04:01.139> sure

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:01.199 
germs are there so you have to make sure

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:02.839 
germs are there so you have to make sure
that<00:04:01.650> you<00:04:01.769> protect<00:04:01.949> yourself<00:04:02.250> against<00:04:02.669> that

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
that you protect yourself against that

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:04.129 
that you protect yourself against that
so<00:04:03.120> I'm<00:04:03.209> going<00:04:03.329> to<00:04:03.359> throw<00:04:03.540> those<00:04:03.659> down<00:04:03.900> there

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
so I'm going to throw those down there

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.339 
so I'm going to throw those down there
then<00:04:04.799> I<00:04:04.889> also<00:04:05.069> got<00:04:05.549> a<00:04:05.909> shower<00:04:06.479> caddy<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:06.959> it's

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
then I also got a shower caddy and it's

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.469 
then I also got a shower caddy and it's
this<00:04:07.439> really<00:04:07.500> pretty<00:04:07.919> purple<00:04:08.430> one<00:04:08.579> and<00:04:08.790> its

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:09.479 
this really pretty purple one and its

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.179 
this really pretty purple one and its
really<00:04:09.629> large<00:04:09.989> like<00:04:10.259> it's<00:04:10.439> very<00:04:10.650> deep<00:04:10.919> so

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:11.189 
really large like it's very deep so

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:12.170 
really large like it's very deep so
that's<00:04:11.370> why<00:04:11.459> I<00:04:11.519> decided<00:04:11.639> get<00:04:11.939> this<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.150> I

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
that's why I decided get this and I

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.670 
that's why I decided get this and I
think<00:04:12.359> it<00:04:12.419> was<00:04:12.479> only<00:04:12.599> like<00:04:12.810> four<00:04:13.290> or<00:04:13.620> five

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
think it was only like four or five

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.060 
think it was only like four or five
dollars<00:04:14.129> from<00:04:14.509> marshalls<00:04:15.509> i<00:04:15.750> also<00:04:16.199> got<00:04:16.590> memory

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
dollars from marshalls i also got memory

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.580 
dollars from marshalls i also got memory
foam<00:04:17.310> bath<00:04:17.699> mats<00:04:18.060> but<00:04:18.449> I'm<00:04:18.810> actually<00:04:19.320> just

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
foam bath mats but I'm actually just

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.930 
foam bath mats but I'm actually just
gonna<00:04:19.709> use<00:04:19.889> them<00:04:19.979> as<00:04:20.159> rugs<00:04:20.459> in<00:04:20.669> my

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
gonna use them as rugs in my

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.150 
gonna use them as rugs in my
because<00:04:21.360> they<00:04:21.510> were<00:04:21.600> T<00:04:21.780> to<00:04:21.870> print<00:04:22.110> and<00:04:22.290> me<00:04:23.010> my

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
because they were T to print and me my

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.500 
because they were T to print and me my
roommate<00:04:23.430> or<00:04:23.580> we're<00:04:23.700> kind<00:04:23.910> of<00:04:24.030> going<00:04:24.150> for<00:04:24.420> like

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
roommate or we're kind of going for like

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.780 
roommate or we're kind of going for like
a<00:04:24.660> pink<00:04:24.990> theme<00:04:25.260> with<00:04:25.470> accents<00:04:26.010> of<00:04:26.100> animal

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
a pink theme with accents of animal

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.250 
a pink theme with accents of animal
prints<00:04:27.030> so<00:04:27.150> I<00:04:27.180> bought<00:04:27.540> like<00:04:27.780> three<00:04:27.810> of<00:04:28.080> these

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
prints so I bought like three of these

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.020 
prints so I bought like three of these
and<00:04:28.530> they're<00:04:28.650> pretty<00:04:28.830> small<00:04:29.100> so<00:04:29.370> i<00:04:29.700> figured<00:04:29.970> i

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
and they're pretty small so i figured i

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.270 
and they're pretty small so i figured i
could<00:04:30.060> find<00:04:30.450> ways<00:04:30.960> to<00:04:31.320> use<00:04:31.710> them<00:04:31.890> in<00:04:32.010> the<00:04:32.100> room

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
could find ways to use them in the room

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.400 
could find ways to use them in the room
so<00:04:32.610> that's<00:04:33.240> the<00:04:33.420> first<00:04:33.570> bin<00:04:33.840> now<00:04:34.020> let's<00:04:34.230> go<00:04:34.380> on

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
so that's the first bin now let's go on

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.440 
so that's the first bin now let's go on
to<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:34.800> second<00:04:35.130> one<00:04:35.220> okay<00:04:35.580> so<00:04:35.910> now<00:04:36.150> in<00:04:36.330> the

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
to the second one okay so now in the

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.210 
to the second one okay so now in the
second<00:04:36.810> bin<00:04:36.960> I<00:04:37.170> just<00:04:37.440> have<00:04:37.560> a<00:04:37.590> couple<00:04:37.800> things

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
second bin I just have a couple things

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.070 
second bin I just have a couple things
because<00:04:38.730> this<00:04:38.910> is<00:04:39.060> mostly<00:04:39.390> school<00:04:39.720> supplies

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
because this is mostly school supplies

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.740 
because this is mostly school supplies

and then what else there's a couple more
things<00:06:27.090> I<00:06:27.419> think<00:06:27.480> down<00:06:27.900> here<00:06:28.140> um<00:06:28.290> Vic<00:06:28.830> for

things I think down here um Vic for

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.250 
things I think down here um Vic for
color<00:06:29.700> ball<00:06:29.970> pen<00:06:30.210> so<00:06:30.450> it's<00:06:30.600> one<00:06:30.720> of<00:06:30.810> those<00:06:30.900> ones

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.260 
color ball pen so it's one of those ones

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.630 
color ball pen so it's one of those ones
where<00:06:31.380> you<00:06:31.500> can<00:06:31.710> click<00:06:31.950> down<00:06:32.130> the<00:06:32.280> different

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:32.640 
where you can click down the different

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.350 
where you can click down the different
colors<00:06:33.030> and<00:06:33.710> then<00:06:34.710> I<00:06:34.830> got<00:06:35.010> white<00:06:35.430> out<00:06:35.640> mini<00:06:35.910> so

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
colors and then I got white out mini so

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.630 
colors and then I got white out mini so
they're<00:06:36.539> like<00:06:36.780> blue<00:06:37.410> and<00:06:37.620> pink<00:06:37.800> and<00:06:38.100> I<00:06:38.490> thought

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:38.640 
they're like blue and pink and I thought

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.590 
they're like blue and pink and I thought
these<00:06:38.729> were<00:06:38.880> really<00:06:39.090> cute<00:06:39.270> because<00:06:39.360> they're

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 
these were really cute because they're

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.210 
these were really cute because they're
small<00:06:39.900> I<00:06:40.169> can<00:06:40.530> just<00:06:40.620> throw<00:06:40.740> them<00:06:40.830> on<00:06:40.950> my<00:06:41.039> bag
