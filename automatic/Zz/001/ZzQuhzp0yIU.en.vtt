00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.759
 secretly again 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.150

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.179

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.230
 like we do the people i take such a letter 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.570

 Cambridge Tuesday afternoon they are building something 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.080
 that goes through 50 cents 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.080
 it's just a matter of waiting 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.240
 because if you can use it 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.450
