00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
I'm getting ready to make another

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.250 
I'm getting ready to make another
segmented<00:00:14.490> bowl<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:15.059> here<00:00:15.509> you<00:00:15.660> can<00:00:15.870> see<00:00:16.109> I've

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
segmented bowl and here you can see I've

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.460 
segmented bowl and here you can see I've
got<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.859> first<00:00:17.580> bullring<00:00:18.240> put<00:00:18.840> together<00:00:18.990> I

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
got the first bullring put together I

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.980 
got the first bullring put together I
say<00:00:20.369> first<00:00:20.640> it's<00:00:20.939> going<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.390> be<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.600> only<00:00:21.720> one

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
say first it's going to be the only one

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.170 
say first it's going to be the only one
that's<00:00:22.410> going<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.680> comprise<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.580> main<00:00:23.789> body

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
that's going to comprise the main body

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.320 
that's going to comprise the main body
of<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.480> bowl<00:00:24.710> this<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.670> top<00:00:27.029> surface

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
of the bowl this is the top surface

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.019 
of the bowl this is the top surface
which<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.529> not<00:00:28.740> yet<00:00:28.980> trimmed<00:00:29.310> off<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.730> can<00:00:29.849> see

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
which is not yet trimmed off you can see

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.250 
which is not yet trimmed off you can see
I've<00:00:30.150> got<00:00:30.330> these<00:00:30.920> on<00:00:31.920> even<00:00:32.660> insert<00:00:33.660> sticking

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
I've got these on even insert sticking

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.860 
I've got these on even insert sticking
up<00:00:34.410> still<00:00:34.739> but<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.730> bottom<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.180> sanded<00:00:36.600> flat

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
up still but the bottom is sanded flat

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.830 
up still but the bottom is sanded flat
and<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:38.190> will<00:00:38.370> go<00:00:38.550> on<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.210> base<00:00:39.680> the<00:00:40.680> base<00:00:41.840> is

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
and that will go on the base the base is

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.470 
and that will go on the base the base is
going<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.290> be<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:44.250> piece<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.879> bird's-eye

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
going to be this piece of bird's-eye

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.170 
going to be this piece of bird's-eye
maple<00:00:45.680> now<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.430> on<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.730> waste<00:00:47.910> block

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
maple now this is on the waste block

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.000 
maple now this is on the waste block
which<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.629> yet<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.079> be<00:00:49.170> put<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.649> face<00:00:49.980> plate

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
which is yet to be put on the face plate

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.450 
which is yet to be put on the face plate
and<00:00:51.199> there's<00:00:52.199> even<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.590> smaller<00:00:52.890> waste<00:00:53.190> block

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
and there's even a smaller waste block

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.680 
and there's even a smaller waste block
here<00:00:54.149> which<00:00:54.719> will<00:00:54.989> allow<00:00:55.199> me<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.829> get<00:00:56.480> into<00:00:57.480> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
here which will allow me to get into the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
here which will allow me to get into the
foot<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.920> little<00:00:59.219> more<00:00:59.460> as<00:00:59.820> I<00:01:00.600> turn<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.020> I've<00:01:01.440> got

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
foot a little more as I turn it I've got

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.709 
foot a little more as I turn it I've got
it<00:01:01.829> planned<00:01:02.070> out<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.730> know<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.000> like<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.600> a

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
it planned out so I know I like it a

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.509 
it planned out so I know I like it a
little<00:01:03.780> bit<00:01:03.960> smaller<00:01:04.290> there<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:05.309> still

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
little bit smaller there it's still

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.490 
little bit smaller there it's still
plenty<00:01:05.820> big<00:01:06.000> enough<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.420> hold<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.840> scale<00:01:07.470> a

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
plenty big enough to hold the scale a

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.100 
plenty big enough to hold the scale a
bowl<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:07.860> I'm<00:01:08.100> going<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.280> mount<00:01:08.400> on<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:09.110> the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
bowl that I'm going to mount on it the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.500 
bowl that I'm going to mount on it the
thing<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:11.460> can<00:01:11.610> see<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.330> still

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
thing is you can see that this is still

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.140 
thing is you can see that this is still
very<00:01:12.570> rough<00:01:12.990> that's<00:01:13.470> intentional<00:01:14.150> because

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
very rough that's intentional because

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.270 
very rough that's intentional because
I'll<00:01:15.330> put<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.020> face<00:01:16.200> plate<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.740> turn

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
I'll put this on the face plate and turn

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.990 
I'll put this on the face plate and turn
that<00:01:17.580> surface<00:01:18.479> smooth<00:01:19.229> rather<00:01:20.159> than<00:01:20.460> sand<00:01:20.790> it

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
that surface smooth rather than sand it

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.390 
that surface smooth rather than sand it
that<00:01:21.420> way<00:01:21.600> there<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.840> know<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:23.100> surface

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
that way there I know that this surface

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.359 
that way there I know that this surface
will<00:01:23.790> be<00:01:23.909> perfectly<00:01:24.330> perpendicular<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
will be perfectly perpendicular to the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.120 
will be perfectly perpendicular to the
axis<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.060> lathe<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.960> then<00:01:28.619> everything<00:01:29.040> I

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
axis of the lathe and then everything I

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.190 
axis of the lathe and then everything I
put<00:01:29.460> on<00:01:29.579> top<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.180> will<00:01:30.479> then<00:01:30.689> be<00:01:30.840> square<00:01:31.170> and

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
put on top of it will then be square and

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.069 
put on top of it will then be square and
true<00:01:31.970> but<00:01:32.970> something<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.450> want<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.689> point<00:01:33.869> out

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
true but something I want to point out

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.679 
true but something I want to point out
is<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.920> if<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.340> look<00:01:35.579> down<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.240> throat<00:01:36.509> I

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
is that if you look down the throat I

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.770 
is that if you look down the throat I
hope<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.229> give<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.860> good<00:01:38.189> view<00:01:38.600> you<00:01:39.600> can

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
hope I can give this a good view you can

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.789 
hope I can give this a good view you can
see<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:41.009> it's<00:01:41.880> really<00:01:42.210> not<00:01:42.390> big<00:01:42.689> enough<00:01:42.799> to

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
see that it's really not big enough to

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.210 
see that it's really not big enough to
be<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.729> actual<00:01:45.240> base<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.810> bowl

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
be the the actual base of this bowl

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.300 
be the the actual base of this bowl
that's<00:01:47.220> because<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:48.090> planned<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:49.070> to<00:01:50.070> have<00:01:50.280> a

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
that's because I planned this to have a

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.569 
that's because I planned this to have a
mother<00:01:51.060> layer<00:01:51.390> in<00:01:51.689> there<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:53.220> will<00:01:53.399> be

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
mother layer in there and that will be

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.240 
mother layer in there and that will be
of<00:01:53.729> contrasting<00:01:54.509> wood<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:55.560> I've<00:01:55.890> tall<00:01:56.130> ready

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
of contrasting wood and I've tall ready

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.060 
of contrasting wood and I've tall ready
cut<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.549> pieces<00:01:56.790> out<00:01:57.119> there<00:01:57.149> right<00:01:57.600> here<00:01:58.070> I'm

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
cut the pieces out there right here I'm

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.160 
cut the pieces out there right here I'm
doubling<00:01:59.520> these<00:01:59.729> up<00:01:59.939> on<00:02:00.119> purpose<00:02:00.570> for<00:02:01.020> one

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
doubling these up on purpose for one

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.330 
doubling these up on purpose for one
thing<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.439> want<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.649> show<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.130> they<00:02:02.280> were

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
thing I want to show you that they were

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.130 
thing I want to show you that they were
cut<00:02:02.729> from<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.780> plank<00:02:04.200> at<00:02:05.159> 45<00:02:05.790> degree<00:02:07.009> and<00:02:08.009> then

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
cut from a plank at 45 degree and then

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.550 
cut from a plank at 45 degree and then
square<00:02:10.610> so<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.700> can<00:02:11.849> see<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.000> cut<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.480> 45

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
square so you can see I cut the 45

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.800 
square so you can see I cut the 45
and<00:02:13.709> then<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.610> cut<00:02:14.819> a<00:02:14.850> square<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.450> get<00:02:15.569> this

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
and then I cut a square to get this

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.780 
and then I cut a square to get this
piece<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.410> that<00:02:16.860> just<00:02:17.100> repeat<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.580> process

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
piece and that just repeat the process

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.050 
piece and that just repeat the process
till<00:02:18.209> I<00:02:18.270> had<00:02:18.480> all<00:02:18.660> eight<00:02:18.959> pieces<00:02:19.790> when<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:20.819> get

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
till I had all eight pieces when you get

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.730 
till I had all eight pieces when you get
eight<00:02:21.209> pieces<00:02:21.480> like<00:02:21.840> this<00:02:22.080> these<00:02:22.410> are<00:02:22.470> real

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
eight pieces like this these are real

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.830 
eight pieces like this these are real
simple<00:02:23.190> there's<00:02:23.400> these<00:02:23.819> are<00:02:23.970> not<00:02:24.120> exotic<00:02:24.420> cuts

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
simple there's these are not exotic cuts

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.000 
simple there's these are not exotic cuts
they're<00:02:25.110> just<00:02:25.350> 45<00:02:25.800> degrees<00:02:27.650> there's<00:02:28.650> many

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
they're just 45 degrees there's many

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.250 
they're just 45 degrees there's many
different<00:02:29.220> ways<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.550> assemble<00:02:30.209> these<00:02:30.390> into<00:02:31.230> a

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
different ways to assemble these into a

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.900 
different ways to assemble these into a
circle

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
circle

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.350 
circle
eight<00:02:32.910> pieces<00:02:33.180> will<00:02:33.569> give<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:33.959> circle<00:02:35.360> but

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
eight pieces will give you a circle but

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.449 
eight pieces will give you a circle but
you<00:02:36.569> can<00:02:36.780> put<00:02:37.020> them<00:02:37.200> together<00:02:37.380> in<00:02:37.950> many

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
you can put them together in many

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.850 
you can put them together in many
different<00:02:38.940> ways<00:02:39.120> you<00:02:39.480> can<00:02:40.080> see<00:02:40.350> I<00:02:40.380> can<00:02:40.709> choose

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
different ways you can see I can choose

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.370 
different ways you can see I can choose
I'm<00:02:41.069> just<00:02:41.280> kind<00:02:41.730> of<00:02:41.810> jumbling<00:02:42.810> along<00:02:43.080> here<00:02:43.350> you

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
I'm just kind of jumbling along here you

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.820 
I'm just kind of jumbling along here you
see<00:02:43.770> you<00:02:43.890> get<00:02:44.069> two<00:02:44.340> square<00:02:45.330> blocks<00:02:45.709> and<00:02:46.709> they

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
see you get two square blocks and they

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.290 
see you get two square blocks and they
go<00:02:47.040> together<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.580> then<00:02:47.670> you<00:02:47.760> can<00:02:47.910> do<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.120> same

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
go together and then you can do the same

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.910 
go together and then you can do the same
on<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.630> other<00:02:48.660> half<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.320> draw<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.500> circle

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
on the other half and draw a circle

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.280 
on the other half and draw a circle
you'll<00:02:50.070> still<00:02:50.280> get<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.459> circle<00:02:50.989> but<00:02:51.989> I<00:02:52.050> want<00:02:52.230> to

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
you'll still get a circle but I want to

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.090 
you'll still get a circle but I want to
optimize<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:53.250> value<00:02:53.940> of<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.150> wood<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:55.200> so

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
optimize the value of the wood and so

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.530 
optimize the value of the wood and so
I'm<00:02:56.190> going<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.400> put<00:02:56.580> them<00:02:56.700> together<00:02:56.790> now<00:02:57.269> I'll

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
I'm going to put them together now I'll

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.580 
I'm going to put them together now I'll
put<00:02:57.750> them<00:02:57.870> together<00:02:58.050> first<00:02:59.510> and<00:03:00.510> let<00:03:01.380> you

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
put them together first and let you

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.309 
put them together first and let you
watch<00:03:02.569> now<00:03:03.569> I'm<00:03:03.690> going<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:03.900> point<00:03:04.110> out<00:03:04.260> a

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
watch now I'm going to point out a

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.840 
watch now I'm going to point out a
detail<00:03:04.980> that<00:03:05.340> is<00:03:05.760> often<00:03:06.380> at<00:03:07.380> best<00:03:07.850> glossed

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
detail that is often at best glossed

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.540 
detail that is often at best glossed
over<00:03:09.090> if<00:03:09.480> it's<00:03:09.660> even<00:03:09.930> mentioned<00:03:10.380> see<00:03:11.310> when<00:03:11.459> you

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
over if it's even mentioned see when you

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.059 
over if it's even mentioned see when you
do<00:03:11.700> segmented<00:03:12.239> turning<00:03:14.510> unlike<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.540> flat<00:03:16.440> board

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
do segmented turning unlike a flat board

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.110 
do segmented turning unlike a flat board
that<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.489> could<00:03:17.640> put<00:03:17.910> to<00:03:18.480> make<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.810> interface

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
that you could put to make the interface

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.610 
that you could put to make the interface
you<00:03:21.120> can<00:03:21.360> avoid<00:03:21.799> or<00:03:23.570> at<00:03:24.570> least<00:03:24.840> minimize<00:03:25.079> the

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
you can avoid or at least minimize the

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.060 
you can avoid or at least minimize the
amount<00:03:25.739> of<00:03:25.860> end<00:03:26.040> grain<00:03:26.310> that<00:03:27.150> you<00:03:27.269> end<00:03:27.420> up<00:03:27.570> with

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
amount of end grain that you end up with

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.660 
amount of end grain that you end up with
and<00:03:29.070> I'll<00:03:29.220> show<00:03:29.459> you<00:03:29.489> a<00:03:30.320> detail<00:03:31.340> beyond<00:03:32.340> that

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
and I'll show you a detail beyond that

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.190 
and I'll show you a detail beyond that
simple<00:03:33.030> statement<00:03:33.239> that<00:03:33.750> will<00:03:33.870> help<00:03:33.989> you

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
simple statement that will help you

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.020 
simple statement that will help you
along<00:03:34.400> now<00:03:35.420> let's<00:03:36.420> get<00:03:37.019> this<00:03:37.579> centered<00:03:38.579> for

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
along now let's get this centered for

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.210 
along now let's get this centered for
you<00:03:39.239> so<00:03:39.450> I<00:03:39.540> can<00:03:39.750> show<00:03:39.989> you<00:03:40.560> what<00:03:40.829> I'm<00:03:40.920> going<00:03:40.950> to

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
you so I can show you what I'm going to

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.479 
you so I can show you what I'm going to
do<00:03:42.140> you<00:03:43.140> can<00:03:43.170> see<00:03:43.440> I've<00:03:43.590> got<00:03:43.739> a<00:03:43.799> circle<00:03:44.100> here

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
do you can see I've got a circle here

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.860 
do you can see I've got a circle here
and<00:03:45.590> this<00:03:46.590> has<00:03:47.100> a<00:03:47.220> void<00:03:47.730> in<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.390> middle<00:03:48.510> which

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
and this has a void in the middle which

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.650 
and this has a void in the middle which
is<00:03:49.049> fine<00:03:49.290> that's<00:03:49.320> going<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.430> occur<00:03:51.060> anyway

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
is fine that's going to occur anyway

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.060 
is fine that's going to occur anyway
because<00:03:51.900> I'm<00:03:52.140> going<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.350> turn<00:03:52.500> it<00:03:52.680> out<00:03:52.739> if<00:03:52.950> it

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
because I'm going to turn it out if it

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.870 
because I'm going to turn it out if it
wasn't<00:03:53.340> already<00:03:53.459> there

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
wasn't already there

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.259 
wasn't already there
and<00:03:53.970> it<00:03:54.959> gives<00:03:55.079> me<00:03:55.200> enough<00:03:55.500> diameter<00:03:56.269> to

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
and it gives me enough diameter to

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.599 
and it gives me enough diameter to
accept<00:03:57.660> this<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.739> it'll<00:03:59.310> be<00:03:59.400> a<00:03:59.430> nice

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
accept this and it'll be a nice

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.500 
accept this and it'll be a nice
contracting<00:04:00.450> intersection<00:04:01.109> to<00:04:01.320> these

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
contracting intersection to these

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.009 
contracting intersection to these
laminations<00:04:03.620> but<00:04:04.620> now<00:04:04.890> I<00:04:05.220> know<00:04:05.700> I<00:04:06.209> want<00:04:06.810> to<00:04:06.900> do

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
laminations but now I know I want to do

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.479 
laminations but now I know I want to do
something<00:04:07.320> a<00:04:07.709> little<00:04:08.579> different<00:04:10.010> I'm<00:04:11.010> turning

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
something a little different I'm turning

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.960 
something a little different I'm turning
these<00:04:11.670> pieces<00:04:12.120> not<00:04:12.720> all<00:04:12.870> of<00:04:13.019> them<00:04:13.820> and<00:04:14.820> then

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
these pieces not all of them and then

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:24.180 
these pieces not all of them and then
I'm<00:04:15.090> going<00:04:15.239> to<00:04:15.269> explain<00:04:15.739> why<00:04:16.739> I'm<00:04:17.100> doing<00:04:17.430> that

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.640 

now<00:04:25.270> you<00:04:26.270> see<00:04:26.480> I<00:04:26.510> still<00:04:26.630> got<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.080> same<00:04:27.260> circle

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
now you see I still got the same circle

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.270 
now you see I still got the same circle
why<00:04:28.040> did<00:04:28.220> I<00:04:28.310> turn<00:04:28.370> those<00:04:28.730> pieces<00:04:29.740> well<00:04:30.740> if<00:04:31.040> you

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
why did I turn those pieces well if you

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.730 
why did I turn those pieces well if you
look<00:04:31.460> carefully<00:04:31.730> you<00:04:32.330> see<00:04:32.540> the<00:04:32.780> grain<00:04:33.440> is

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
look carefully you see the grain is

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.900 
look carefully you see the grain is
running<00:04:34.070> this<00:04:34.370> way<00:04:34.430> in<00:04:34.820> this<00:04:35.780> way<00:04:35.990> this<00:04:36.500> way

all the end grain is butted up to the

all the end grain is butted up to the
adjacent<00:04:42.590> pieces<00:04:43.660> if<00:04:44.660> I<00:04:45.020> don't<00:04:45.230> flip<00:04:45.440> this

around for instance if I leave this
piece<00:04:48.050> like<00:04:48.320> this<00:04:48.650> I'll<00:04:49.640> still<00:04:49.970> get<00:04:50.060> a<00:04:50.120> circle

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 
piece like this I'll still get a circle

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.780 
piece like this I'll still get a circle
but<00:04:51.350> then<00:04:51.530> as<00:04:51.680> I<00:04:51.770> cut<00:04:52.010> that<00:04:52.190> circle

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
but then as I cut that circle

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.230 
but then as I cut that circle
I've<00:04:52.850> got<00:04:53.660> end<00:04:53.930> grain<00:04:54.169> on<00:04:54.320> the<00:04:55.280> edge<00:04:55.400> and<00:04:55.790> we

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
I've got end grain on the edge and we

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.670 
I've got end grain on the edge and we
all<00:04:56.360> know<00:04:56.510> the<00:04:56.660> end<00:04:56.840> grain<00:04:57.080> is<00:04:57.110> not<00:04:57.380> our<00:04:57.500> friend

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
all know the end grain is not our friend

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.010 
all know the end grain is not our friend
that's<00:04:58.640> why<00:04:58.880> they<00:04:59.030> invented<00:04:59.270> so<00:04:59.840> much

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
that's why they invented so much

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.430 
that's why they invented so much
sandpaper<00:05:01.120> but<00:05:02.120> you<00:05:02.450> can<00:05:02.660> minimize<00:05:03.169> the

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
sandpaper but you can minimize the

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.560 
sandpaper but you can minimize the
amount<00:05:03.470> of<00:05:03.680> end<00:05:03.860> grain<00:05:04.070> by<00:05:04.310> simply<00:05:04.730> flipping

the<00:05:05.840> piece<00:05:06.520> now<00:05:07.520> you've<00:05:07.700> still<00:05:07.940> got<00:05:08.090> your

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
the piece now you've still got your

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.900 
the piece now you've still got your
circle<00:05:08.540> and<00:05:09.220> you've<00:05:10.220> minimized<00:05:10.520> the<00:05:10.880> amount

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
circle and you've minimized the amount

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.370 
circle and you've minimized the amount
of<00:05:11.090> end<00:05:11.300> grain<00:05:11.540> in<00:05:11.950> your<00:05:12.950> final<00:05:13.280> construction

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
of end grain in your final construction

of end grain in your final construction
that's<00:05:15.380> the<00:05:15.650> detail<00:05:15.800> I<00:05:16.040> wanted<00:05:16.370> to<00:05:16.430> share<00:05:16.610> with

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
that's the detail I wanted to share with

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.400 
that's the detail I wanted to share with
you<00:05:16.940> now<00:05:16.970> I'm<00:05:17.210> going<00:05:17.450> to<00:05:17.570> go<00:05:17.720> ahead<00:05:17.840> and<00:05:18.230> glue

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
you now I'm going to go ahead and glue

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.350 
you now I'm going to go ahead and glue
this<00:05:18.620> together<00:05:18.890> with<00:05:19.430> some<00:05:19.640> contrasting

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
this together with some contrasting

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.280 
this together with some contrasting
veneer<00:05:20.720> much<00:05:21.290> as<00:05:21.470> you<00:05:21.680> see<00:05:21.919> I've<00:05:22.070> done<00:05:22.250> here

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
veneer much as you see I've done here

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.880 
veneer much as you see I've done here
and<00:05:24.290> then<00:05:24.410> this<00:05:24.650> will<00:05:24.830> go<00:05:24.979> down<00:05:25.300> there

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890 
and then this will go down there

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.240 
and then this will go down there
but<00:05:27.890> first<00:05:28.250> I'll<00:05:28.729> make<00:05:28.880> this<00:05:29.270> ring<00:05:29.600> glue<00:05:29.990> it

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
but first I'll make this ring glue it

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.659 
but first I'll make this ring glue it
sand<00:05:31.250> one<00:05:31.490> side<00:05:31.820> I<00:05:32.180> will<00:05:33.020> turn<00:05:33.950> this<00:05:34.190> surface

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
sand one side I will turn this surface

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:35.920 
sand one side I will turn this surface
remember<00:05:35.090> this<00:05:35.240> is<00:05:35.360> going<00:05:35.510> to<00:05:35.570> go<00:05:35.690> on<00:05:35.810> the

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
remember this is going to go on the

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.040 
remember this is going to go on the
faceplate<00:05:36.169> and<00:05:36.970> this<00:05:37.970> is<00:05:38.150> going<00:05:38.600> to<00:05:38.690> be<00:05:38.780> turned

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
faceplate and this is going to be turned

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.659 
faceplate and this is going to be turned
true<00:05:39.350> to<00:05:39.470> the<00:05:39.590> lathe<00:05:39.800> and<00:05:40.040> then<00:05:40.220> when<00:05:40.370> I<00:05:40.400> have

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
true to the lathe and then when I have

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.560 
true to the lathe and then when I have
one<00:05:41.240> of<00:05:41.390> these<00:05:41.510> surfaces<00:05:42.110> to<00:05:43.010> true<00:05:43.610> I'll<00:05:44.270> glue

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
one of these surfaces to true I'll glue

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.330 
one of these surfaces to true I'll glue
that<00:05:44.780> surface<00:05:45.140> to<00:05:45.290> here<00:05:45.560> and<00:05:45.770> then<00:05:45.890> I'll<00:05:46.040> turn

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
that surface to here and then I'll turn

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.540 
that surface to here and then I'll turn
that<00:05:46.760> surface<00:05:47.300> before<00:05:48.169> I<00:05:48.680> mount<00:05:49.160> the<00:05:49.250> ring

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
that surface before I mount the ring

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.530 
that surface before I mount the ring
I've<00:05:50.330> still<00:05:50.660> got<00:05:50.810> to<00:05:50.990> build<00:05:51.440> another<00:05:52.100> ring<00:05:52.540> for

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:53.540 
I've still got to build another ring for

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.659 
I've still got to build another ring for
what<00:05:53.720> will<00:05:53.870> Toby<00:05:54.350> become<00:05:54.919> the<00:05:55.040> top<00:05:55.250> lip<00:05:55.520> of

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
what will Toby become the top lip of

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:59.290 
what will Toby become the top lip of
this<00:05:55.790> bowl<00:05:56.060> and<00:05:56.890> I<00:05:57.890> just<00:05:58.640> want<00:05:58.820> to<00:05:59.000> show<00:05:59.240> you

the little detail about how to carefully

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.040 
the little detail about how to carefully
keep<00:06:03.350> track<00:06:04.010> of<00:06:04.280> your<00:06:04.460> grain<00:06:05.050> orientation

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
keep track of your grain orientation

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.710 
keep track of your grain orientation
when<00:06:06.200> you're<00:06:06.350> doing<00:06:06.650> a<00:06:06.770> segmented<00:06:07.220> layup
