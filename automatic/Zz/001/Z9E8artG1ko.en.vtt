00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:32.289 

chromecast<00:01:25.100> it<00:01:25.490> gets<00:01:25.790> back<00:01:29.350> and<00:01:31.000> now<00:01:32.000> I<00:01:32.030> can

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
chromecast it gets back and now I can

that<00:01:39.560> really<00:01:39.710> read<00:01:40.070> icon<00:01:40.430> to<00:01:40.790> inform<00:01:41.090> you

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
that really read icon to inform you

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.139 
that really read icon to inform you
about<00:01:41.300> that

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
about that

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.380 
about that
so<00:01:44.149> now<00:01:44.390> let's<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:44.780> second<00:01:45.259> step<00:01:46.149> browse<00:01:47.149> to<00:01:47.360> a

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
so now let's the second step browse to a

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.210 
so now let's the second step browse to a
favorite<00:01:47.810> website<00:01:48.200> I<00:01:50.590> have<00:01:51.590> one<00:01:51.860> in<00:01:52.040> the

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
favorite website I have one in the

00:01:52.220 --> 00:02:07.400 
favorite website I have one in the
pastry

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.410 

so<00:02:08.410> that<00:02:08.679> one<00:02:08.830> is<00:02:08.860> on<00:02:09.070> YouTube<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:12.430> I<00:02:12.970> guess

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
so that one is on YouTube and I guess

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.480 
so that one is on YouTube and I guess
you<00:02:13.570> have<00:02:13.660> wait<00:02:13.840> some<00:02:14.020> seconds<00:02:14.380> before<00:02:15.040> the

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
you have wait some seconds before the

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.020 
you have wait some seconds before the
app<00:02:15.610> recognizes<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.900> video<00:02:17.520> as<00:02:18.520> you<00:02:18.670> can<00:02:18.850> see

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
app recognizes the video as you can see

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.490 
app recognizes the video as you can see
here<00:02:19.240> at<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.420> bottom<00:02:21.630> there's<00:02:22.630> no<00:02:23.020> view<00:02:23.170> link

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
here at the bottom there's no view link

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.870 
here at the bottom there's no view link
found<00:02:23.740> to<00:02:23.830> cast<00:02:24.300> yet<00:02:25.300> I<00:02:26.490> guess<00:02:27.490> I<00:02:27.640> would<00:02:27.760> have

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
found to cast yet I guess I would have

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:39.449 
found to cast yet I guess I would have
to<00:02:27.970> start<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:28.360> video<00:02:28.510> first<00:02:36.240> as<00:02:38.100> you<00:02:39.100> can<00:02:39.280> see

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
to start the video first as you can see

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.660 
to start the video first as you can see
here<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:40.180> app<00:02:40.300> has<00:02:40.450> found<00:02:40.690> our<00:02:40.900> video<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.890> to

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
here the app has found our video and to

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.420 
here the app has found our video and to
start<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.300> chromecast<00:02:43.540> streaming<00:02:44.310> we<00:02:45.310> have

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
start the chromecast streaming we have

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:53.580

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.410 

I've<00:03:05.069> seen<00:03:05.340> on<00:03:05.489> some<00:03:05.700> websites<00:03:06.090> it's

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
I've seen on some websites it's

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.059 
I've seen on some websites it's
necessary<00:03:07.020> to<00:03:07.110> start<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.560> video<00:03:07.830> first

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
necessary to start the video first

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.780 
necessary to start the video first
before<00:03:08.520> it<00:03:08.819> can<00:03:09.060> be<00:03:09.180> recognized<00:03:09.660> by<00:03:09.840> our<00:03:10.790> some
