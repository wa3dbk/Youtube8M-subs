number and our number 7306 now the

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.260 
number and our number 7306 now the
underlined<00:00:18.330> digit<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.930> 3<00:00:19.880> so<00:00:20.880> we're<00:00:21.090> going<00:00:21.180> to

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
underlined digit is 3 so we're going to

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.330 
underlined digit is 3 so we're going to
use<00:00:21.420> our<00:00:21.600> place<00:00:21.869> value<00:00:22.350> chart<00:00:22.380> for<00:00:23.130> some

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
use our place value chart for some

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.390 
use our place value chart for some
healthier<00:00:24.019> and<00:00:25.019> let's<00:00:25.470> just<00:00:25.619> briefly<00:00:26.010> discuss

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
healthier and let's just briefly discuss

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.700 
healthier and let's just briefly discuss
how<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.640> use<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.970> place<00:00:27.150> value<00:00:27.539> chart<00:00:27.710> you

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
how to use the place value chart you

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.710 
how to use the place value chart you
want<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.099> take<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.699> rightmost<00:00:30.000> digit<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.660> your

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
want to take the rightmost digit of your

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.380 
want to take the rightmost digit of your
number<00:00:31.109> which<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.920> 6<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.309> this<00:00:32.399> case<00:00:32.460> you

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
number which is the 6 in this case you

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.000 
number which is the 6 in this case you
want<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.600> put<00:00:33.750> in<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.930> rightmost<00:00:34.170> section<00:00:34.829> of

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
want to put in the rightmost section of

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.220 
want to put in the rightmost section of
your<00:00:35.190> place<00:00:35.430> value<00:00:35.850> chart<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.809> 6<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.170> going

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
your place value chart so the 6 is going

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.500 
your place value chart so the 6 is going
to<00:00:37.350> go<00:00:37.440> right<00:00:37.710> here<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.940> tells<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.329> that

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
to go right here and that tells you that

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.080 
to go right here and that tells you that
the<00:00:39.660> 6<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.260> ones<00:00:40.500> place

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
the 6 is in the ones place

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.490 
the 6 is in the ones place
now<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.149> move<00:00:42.390> one<00:00:42.629> digit<00:00:42.930> immediately<00:00:43.350> to

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
now you move one digit immediately to

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.040 
now you move one digit immediately to
the<00:00:43.620> left<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.190> your<00:00:44.670> number<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.840> that's<00:00:45.960> going

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
the left and your number so that's going

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.290 
the left and your number so that's going
to<00:00:46.110> be<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.350> 0<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.520> you're<00:00:47.670> going<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.820> move<00:00:47.969> one

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
to be the 0 and you're going to move one

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.360 
to be the 0 and you're going to move one
section<00:00:49.079> immediately<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> left<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
section immediately to the left on the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.459 
section immediately to the left on the
place<00:00:50.579> value<00:00:51.000> chart<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.020> 0<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.320> going<00:00:52.379> to

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
place value chart so the 0 is going to

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.920 
place value chart so the 0 is going to
go<00:00:52.590> right<00:00:52.800> here<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.820> tells<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.600> 0

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
go right here that tells you that the 0

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.650 
go right here that tells you that the 0
is<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.440> tens<00:00:55.739> place<00:00:56.449> ok<00:00:57.449> you're<00:00:57.570> gonna

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
is in the tens place ok you're gonna

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.490 
is in the tens place ok you're gonna
keep<00:00:57.899> doing<00:00:58.320> this

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
keep doing this

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.380 
keep doing this
so<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:59.190> go<00:00:59.309> one<00:00:59.579> day<00:00:59.699> just<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.030> left<00:01:00.180> again

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
so you go one day just to the left again

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.009 
so you go one day just to the left again
you're<00:01:00.750> gonna<00:01:00.840> have<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.109> 3<00:01:01.850> and<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.600> put<00:01:03.809> that

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
you're gonna have the 3 and you put that

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.509 
you're gonna have the 3 and you put that
one<00:01:04.350> section<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.949> left<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.339> place

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
one section to the left on the place

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.000 
one section to the left on the place
value<00:01:05.909> chart<00:01:06.200> so<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.229> tells<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:07.890> in

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
value chart so that tells you it's in

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.670 
value chart so that tells you it's in
the<00:01:08.100> hundreds<00:01:08.520> place<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.380> your<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.470> do<00:01:10.560> that

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
the hundreds place and your and do that

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.679 
the hundreds place and your and do that
again<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.250> go<00:01:11.490> one<00:01:11.760> dish<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.270> left<00:01:12.510> you

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
again so you go one dish to the left you

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.560 
again so you go one dish to the left you
have<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.869> 7<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.770> goes<00:01:14.010> into<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.970> next<00:01:15.299> section

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
have a 7 that goes into the next section

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.570 
have a 7 that goes into the next section
to<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.930> left<00:01:15.990> on<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.439> place<00:01:17.189> value<00:01:17.549> chart

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.929 
underlined data is just this 0 right
here<00:01:54.979> so<00:01:55.979> again<00:01:56.070> we're<00:01:56.310> going<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.490> use<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> place

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
here so again we're going to use a place

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.920 
here so again we're going to use a place
value<00:01:57.149> chart<00:01:57.360> for<00:01:57.750> some<00:01:57.930> assistance<00:01:59.750> and<00:02:00.750> we

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
value chart for some assistance and we

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.240 
value chart for some assistance and we
always<00:02:01.110> want<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.409> start<00:02:01.530> at<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.829> rightmost

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
always want to start at the rightmost

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.190 
always want to start at the rightmost
digit<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.700> number<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.570> put<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:03.990> on<00:02:04.140> the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
digit of the number and put that on the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.749 
digit of the number and put that on the
rightmost<00:02:04.439> section<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.159> place<00:02:05.340> value<00:02:05.729> chart

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
rightmost section the place value chart

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.020 
rightmost section the place value chart
so<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.840> 1<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.380> going<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.560> go<00:02:07.680> right<00:02:07.950> here<00:02:08.030> and

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
so the 1 is going to go right here and

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.210 
so the 1 is going to go right here and
that<00:02:09.149> tells<00:02:09.390> us<00:02:09.539> this<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.929> ones<00:02:10.140> place<00:02:10.500> we

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
that tells us this in the ones place we

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.040 
that tells us this in the ones place we
move<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.670> left<00:02:11.790> one<00:02:12.090> digit<00:02:12.420> but<00:02:12.750> the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
move to the left one digit but the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.320 
move to the left one digit but the
right<00:02:13.290> here<00:02:13.800> so<00:02:14.280> that's<00:02:14.460> housed<00:02:14.640> in<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.000> tense

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
right here so that's housed in a tense

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.420 
right here so that's housed in a tense
place<00:02:15.690> we<00:02:16.290> move<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.680> left<00:02:16.800> again<00:02:17.010> we<00:02:17.280> got<00:02:17.400> a

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
place we move to the left again we got a

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.030 
place we move to the left again we got a
four<00:02:17.810> that's<00:02:18.810> in<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.110> hundreds<00:02:19.500> place<00:02:19.740> then

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
four that's in the hundreds place then

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.490 
four that's in the hundreds place then
we<00:02:20.130> got<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.280> six<00:02:20.700> that's<00:02:21.600> in<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:21.990> thousands

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
we got a six that's in the thousands

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.860 
we got a six that's in the thousands
place<00:02:22.560> we<00:02:22.980> got<00:02:23.070> a<00:02:23.130> zero<00:02:23.520> that's<00:02:24.360> in<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.660> ten

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
place we got a zero that's in the ten

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.060 
place we got a zero that's in the ten
thousands<00:02:25.380> place<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.800> then<00:02:25.890> we<00:02:25.950> have<00:02:26.040> a

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
thousands place and then we have a

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.610 
thousands place and then we have a
thirty<00:02:26.460> that's<00:02:27.270> in<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.630> hundred<00:02:28.050> thousands

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
thirty that's in the hundred thousands

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.950 
thirty that's in the hundred thousands
place<00:02:28.970> so<00:02:29.970> we<00:02:30.120> wanted<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.480> know<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.660> place

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
place so we wanted to know the place

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.070 
place so we wanted to know the place
value<00:02:31.380> put<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.620> zero<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.690> that's<00:02:33.690> going<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:33.990> be

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
value put a zero and that's going to be

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.930 
value put a zero and that's going to be
in<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.290> ten<00:02:34.590> thousands<00:02:35.280> place<00:02:35.460> let's<00:02:35.790> just

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
in the ten thousands place let's just

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:44.740 
in the ten thousands place let's just
write<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.360> out<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.930> zero<00:02:40.310> is<00:02:41.310> in<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:42.800> ten

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
write that out to zero is in the ten

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.930 
write that out to zero is in the ten
thousands<00:02:45.750> place<00:02:49.520> let's<00:02:50.520> take<00:02:50.580> a<00:02:50.730> look<00:02:50.880> at

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
thousands place let's take a look at

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.210 
thousands place let's take a look at
another<00:02:51.120> example

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
another example

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.010 
another example
okay<00:02:53.220> for<00:02:53.400> problem<00:02:53.760> three<00:02:54.120> our<00:02:54.390> objective<00:02:54.900> is

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
okay for problem three our objective is

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.140 
okay for problem three our objective is
to<00:02:55.050> determine<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.650> place<00:02:55.890> value<00:02:56.400> for<00:02:57.060> the

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
to determine the place value for the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.930 
to determine the place value for the
underlined<00:02:57.600> digit<00:02:57.630> in<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:58.080> given<00:02:58.380> number<00:02:58.940> so

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
underlined digit in the given number so

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.640 
underlined digit in the given number so
the<00:03:00.150> number<00:03:00.390> here<00:03:00.570> is<00:03:00.660> seven<00:03:01.050> million<00:03:01.290> eight

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
the number here is seven million eight

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.050 
the number here is seven million eight
hundred<00:03:01.680> five<00:03:02.100> thousand<00:03:02.730> three<00:03:02.850> hundred

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
hundred five thousand three hundred

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.690 
hundred five thousand three hundred
twenty<00:03:03.570> one<00:03:04.160> so<00:03:05.160> again<00:03:05.340> we're<00:03:05.490> going<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:05.640> use

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
twenty one so again we're going to use

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.140 
twenty one so again we're going to use
our<00:03:05.910> place<00:03:06.090> value<00:03:06.510> chart<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.790> start<00:03:09.090> with

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
our place value chart and you start with

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.460 
our place value chart and you start with
the<00:03:09.240> rightmost<00:03:09.630> digit<00:03:09.810> of<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.050> number<00:03:10.110> that's

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
the rightmost digit of the number that's

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.430 
the rightmost digit of the number that's
a<00:03:10.620> 1<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.250> that<00:03:11.880> goes<00:03:12.030> right<00:03:12.300> here<00:03:12.360> in<00:03:13.320> the

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
a 1 and that goes right here in the

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.900 
a 1 and that goes right here in the
rightmost<00:03:13.650> section<00:03:14.220> of<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.340> place<00:03:14.520> value

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
rightmost section of the place value

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.690 
rightmost section of the place value
chart<00:03:14.940> so<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.570> one<00:03:15.810> is<00:03:15.930> in<00:03:16.050> the<00:03:16.140> ones<00:03:16.410> place

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
chart so the one is in the ones place

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.740 
chart so the one is in the ones place
I'm<00:03:17.700> just<00:03:17.820> going<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.120> keep<00:03:18.239> working<00:03:18.630> your<00:03:18.690> way

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:05.159 
rightmost section a place value chart so

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:07.399 
rightmost section a place value chart so
that<00:06:05.189> 2<00:06:05.550> goes<00:06:05.789> here<00:06:05.819> and<00:06:06.419> it<00:06:06.990> tells<00:06:07.199> us<00:06:07.319> that

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:07.409 
that 2 goes here and it tells us that

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:09.829 
that 2 goes here and it tells us that
the<00:06:07.620> two<00:06:07.800> is<00:06:07.949> in<00:06:08.039> the<00:06:08.099> ones<00:06:08.159> place<00:06:08.509> and<00:06:09.509> we<00:06:09.659> just

00:06:09.829 --> 00:06:09.839 
the two is in the ones place and we just

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:12.230 
the two is in the ones place and we just
work<00:06:10.050> our<00:06:10.229> way<00:06:10.349> to<00:06:10.409> the<00:06:10.620> left<00:06:10.860> the<00:06:11.699> one<00:06:11.969> would

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
work our way to the left the one would

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.749 
work our way to the left the one would
go<00:06:12.389> in<00:06:12.509> the<00:06:12.599> tens<00:06:12.839> place<00:06:13.099> the<00:06:14.099> three<00:06:14.490> would<00:06:14.639> go

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 
go in the tens place the three would go

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:17.209 
go in the tens place the three would go
in<00:06:14.879> the<00:06:14.939> hundreds<00:06:15.300> place<00:06:15.439> the<00:06:16.439> zero<00:06:16.800> goes<00:06:17.069> in

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:17.219 
in the hundreds place the zero goes in

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:19.999 
in the hundreds place the zero goes in
the<00:06:17.310> thousands<00:06:17.849> place<00:06:17.909> the<00:06:18.810> five<00:06:19.229> goes<00:06:19.770> into

that's<00:06:31.169> going<00:06:31.289> to<00:06:31.349> be<00:06:31.439> in<00:06:31.500> one<00:06:31.620> hundred

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
that's going to be in one hundred

that's going to be in one hundred
millions<00:06:32.219> place<00:06:32.430> a<00:06:32.879> one<00:06:33.810> in<00:06:34.080> the<00:06:34.139> billions

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:34.469 
millions place a one in the billions

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:36.800 
millions place a one in the billions
place<00:06:34.830> and<00:06:35.610> another<00:06:35.849> one<00:06:36.180> that's<00:06:36.419> in<00:06:36.539> the<00:06:36.630> ten

place and another one that's in the ten
billions<00:06:37.169> place<00:06:37.469> and<00:06:37.830> then<00:06:38.430> our<00:06:38.550> nine<00:06:38.759> that's

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:39.149 
billions place and then our nine that's

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:39.680 
billions place and then our nine that's
in<00:06:39.270> the<00:06:39.360> honey

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:39.690

in the honey
billions<00:06:39.990> place<00:06:40.320> and<00:06:40.710> that<00:06:41.370> we<00:06:41.490> have<00:06:41.640> a<00:06:41.670> four

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 
billions place and that we have a four

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.020 
billions place and that we have a four
in<00:06:42.420> the<00:06:42.570> trillions<00:06:42.840> place<00:06:43.550> so<00:06:44.550> what<00:06:44.790> comes

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.030 
in the trillions place so what comes

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.530 
in the trillions place so what comes
after<00:06:45.540> the<00:06:46.260> trillions<00:06:46.710> place<00:06:47.210> well<00:06:48.210> if<00:06:48.360> you'll

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:48.540 
after the trillions place well if you'll

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:53.270 
after the trillions place well if you'll
notice<00:06:48.810> here<00:06:49.610> after<00:06:50.610> you<00:06:50.760> have<00:06:51.800> ones<00:06:52.800> you<00:06:53.130> have

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 
notice here after you have ones you have

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.220 
notice here after you have ones you have
tens<00:06:53.580> than<00:06:53.940> hundreds<00:06:54.420> after<00:06:54.870> you<00:06:55.110> have

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:55.230 
tens than hundreds after you have

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.020 
tens than hundreds after you have
thousands<00:06:55.770> you<00:06:55.890> have<00:06:56.010> ten<00:06:56.340> thousands<00:06:56.910> and

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
thousands you have ten thousands and

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.120 
thousands you have ten thousands and
hundred<00:06:57.300> thousands<00:06:57.810> I've<00:06:58.350> created<00:06:58.620> millions

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.130 
hundred thousands I've created millions

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:00.380 
hundred thousands I've created millions
you<00:06:59.280> have<00:06:59.370> ten<00:06:59.580> millions<00:06:59.940> of<00:07:00.090> hundred

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:00.390 
you have ten millions of hundred

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.090 
you have ten millions of hundred
millions<00:07:00.720> now<00:07:01.170> after<00:07:01.380> you<00:07:01.500> have<00:07:01.530> billions<00:07:02.010> you

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100 
millions now after you have billions you

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.130 
millions now after you have billions you
have<00:07:02.220> ten<00:07:02.460> billions<00:07:02.850> of<00:07:02.940> hundred<00:07:03.240> billions<00:07:03.510> so

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:04.140 
have ten billions of hundred billions so

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.050 
have ten billions of hundred billions so
following<00:07:04.590> that<00:07:04.740> pattern<00:07:05.130> after<00:07:05.850> you<00:07:05.910> have

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.060 
following that pattern after you have

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.200 
following that pattern after you have
trillions<00:07:06.420> you<00:07:07.320> have<00:07:07.530> ten<00:07:08.010> trillions<00:07:08.640> than

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.210 
trillions you have ten trillions than

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:14.410 
trillions you have ten trillions than
hundred<00:07:09.870> trillions<00:07:10.320> I'd<00:07:11.040> see<00:07:11.280> would<00:07:11.430> have<00:07:11.580> ten

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:14.420 

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.920 

trillions<00:07:15.420> and<00:07:17.000> that<00:07:18.000> would<00:07:18.150> be<00:07:18.270> where<00:07:18.780> the

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:18.930 
trillions and that would be where the

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.110 
trillions and that would be where the
zero<00:07:19.200> would<00:07:19.470> go<00:07:19.620> so<00:07:20.100> just<00:07:20.250> go<00:07:20.370> a<00:07:20.430> line<00:07:20.790> there

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 
zero would go so just go a line there

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:27.500 
zero would go so just go a line there
for<00:07:21.360> that<00:07:21.510> and<00:07:23.720> then<00:07:24.720> after<00:07:24.870> that<00:07:26.360> you<00:07:27.360> would

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:27.510 
for that and then after that you would

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:34.220 
for that and then after that you would
have<00:07:27.660> hundred<00:07:30.020> trillions<00:07:32.870> and<00:07:33.870> that's<00:07:34.050> where

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:34.230 
have hundred trillions and that's where

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.220 
have hundred trillions and that's where
the<00:07:34.320> six<00:07:34.560> we<00:07:34.710> killed<00:07:35.780> why<00:07:36.780> should<00:07:37.020> I<00:07:37.050> answer

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:37.230 
the six we killed why should I answer

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.770 
the six we killed why should I answer
the<00:07:37.500> question<00:07:37.530> here<00:07:38.340> the<00:07:38.910> six<00:07:39.300> is<00:07:39.510> in<00:07:39.540> the

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:39.780 
the question here the six is in the

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.730 
the question here the six is in the
hundred<00:07:40.470> trillions<00:07:41.130> place
