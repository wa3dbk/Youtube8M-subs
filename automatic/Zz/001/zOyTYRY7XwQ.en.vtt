the<00:01:07.049> microwave<00:01:07.400> that's<00:01:08.400> how<00:01:08.549> we're<00:01:08.700> gonna

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
the microwave that's how we're gonna

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.300 
the microwave that's how we're gonna
measure<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.270> speed<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.600> light<00:01:09.830> so<00:01:10.830> I'm<00:01:11.100> just

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
measure the speed of light so I'm just

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.390 
measure the speed of light so I'm just
gonna<00:01:11.490> get<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> few<00:01:11.790> more<00:01:12.090> egg<00:01:12.210> whites<00:01:13.369> okay<00:01:14.369> I

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
gonna get a few more egg whites okay I

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.920 
gonna get a few more egg whites okay I
got<00:01:14.610> enough<00:01:14.850> egg<00:01:15.060> whites<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.570> cover<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
got enough egg whites to cover the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.109 
got enough egg whites to cover the
bottom<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.350> pan<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:17.340> might<00:01:17.640> see<00:01:17.909> some

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
bottom of the pan you might see some

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.609 
bottom of the pan you might see some
flecks<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.540> yellow<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.960> there<00:01:19.140> one<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
flecks of yellow in there one of the

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.590 
flecks of yellow in there one of the
yolks<00:01:19.830> actually<00:01:20.340> broke<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:20.820> there<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.180> just

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
yolks actually broke in there I just

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.770 
yolks actually broke in there I just
scooped<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.229> out<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> little<00:01:22.530> bit

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
scooped it out a little bit

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.539 
scooped it out a little bit
does<00:01:24.780> couple<00:01:25.110> flex<00:01:25.380> left<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.979> think<00:01:26.100> that'll<00:01:26.520> be

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
does couple flex left I think that'll be

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.440 
does couple flex left I think that'll be
okay<00:01:26.909> we'll<00:01:27.600> find<00:01:27.810> out<00:01:27.990> shortly<00:01:29.299> now<00:01:30.299> it's

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
okay we'll find out shortly now it's

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.410 
okay we'll find out shortly now it's
time<00:01:30.659> for<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.900> microwave<00:01:32.090> basically<00:01:33.090> we<00:01:33.210> put

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
time for the microwave basically we put

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.660 
time for the microwave basically we put
it<00:01:33.540> in<00:01:33.720> we<00:01:34.290> let<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.770> rip<00:01:34.950> for<00:01:35.189> about<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> minute

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
it in we let it rip for about a minute

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.080 
it in we let it rip for about a minute
and<00:01:36.290> see<00:01:37.290> what<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.500> egg<00:01:37.619> whites<00:01:37.890> look<00:01:38.159> like<00:01:38.340> we

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
and see what the egg whites look like we

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.560 
and see what the egg whites look like we
don't<00:01:39.420> want<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.900> move<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.320> pan<00:01:41.090> what<00:01:42.090> if<00:01:42.299> we

don't<00:02:01.350> don't<00:02:01.860> wiggle<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.520> pan<00:02:02.729> if<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.030> wiggle

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
don't don't wiggle the pan if you wiggle

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.520 
don't don't wiggle the pan if you wiggle
a<00:02:03.509> pan<00:02:03.719> you're<00:02:03.840> gonna<00:02:03.930> have<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.170> start<00:02:04.380> over

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
a pan you're gonna have to start over

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.600 
a pan you're gonna have to start over
you<00:02:06.110> know<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.229> think<00:02:07.350> we're<00:02:07.619> getting<00:02:07.829> there<00:02:07.950> you

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
you know I think we're getting there you

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.150 
you know I think we're getting there you
see<00:02:08.789> those<00:02:08.940> two<00:02:09.119> brown<00:02:09.330> spots<00:02:09.860> those<00:02:10.860> are<00:02:11.009> hot

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
see those two brown spots those are hot

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.100 
see those two brown spots those are hot
spots<00:02:11.489> in<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.849> microwave

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
spots in a microwave

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.960 
spots in a microwave
I<00:02:13.170> think<00:02:13.920> if<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.130> measured<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.580> distance

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
I think if I measured the distance

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.810 
I think if I measured the distance
between<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.480> two<00:02:15.660> that<00:02:15.960> will<00:02:16.260> tell<00:02:16.650> me<00:02:16.820> half

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
between the two that will tell me half

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.710 
between the two that will tell me half
the<00:02:18.150> wavelength<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.770> radio<00:02:20.190> waves<00:02:20.720> that

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
the wavelength of the radio waves that

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.390 
the wavelength of the radio waves that
this<00:02:22.260> microwave<00:02:22.770> uses<00:02:23.780> knowing<00:02:24.780> the

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
this microwave uses knowing the

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.650 
this microwave uses knowing the
wavelength<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:27.320> knowing<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.410> frequency<00:02:29.040> I

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
wavelength and knowing the frequency I

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.340 
wavelength and knowing the frequency I
can<00:02:30.660> find<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.170> speed<00:02:31.410> of<00:02:31.440> light

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
can find the speed of light

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.340 
can find the speed of light
now<00:02:34.350> those<00:02:34.590> two<00:02:34.620> brown<00:02:35.010> spots<00:02:35.430> were<00:02:36.350> nine

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
now those two brown spots were nine

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.920 
now those two brown spots were nine
centimeters<00:02:38.040> apart<00:02:38.400> there's<00:02:39.330> two<00:02:39.510> other<00:02:39.690> hot

pan right there too right there that

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.010 
pan right there too right there that
looks<00:02:50.820> like<00:02:50.940> a<00:02:50.970> couple<00:02:51.270> other<00:02:51.570> hot<00:02:51.810> spots

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
looks like a couple other hot spots

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.720 
looks like a couple other hot spots
there<00:02:52.350> are<00:02:52.410> only<00:02:52.530> seven<00:02:52.950> centimeters<00:02:53.430> apart

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
there are only seven centimeters apart

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.530 
there are only seven centimeters apart
this<00:02:55.040> calculation<00:02:56.040> is<00:02:56.310> prone<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.880> error<00:02:57.090> so

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
this calculation is prone to error so

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.270 
this calculation is prone to error so
let's<00:03:00.540> let's<00:03:01.290> run<00:03:01.470> this<00:03:01.590> some<00:03:01.709> more<00:03:01.860> see<00:03:02.100> if<00:03:02.130> we

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
let's let's run this some more see if we

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.550 
let's let's run this some more see if we
can<00:03:02.370> get<00:03:02.459> some<00:03:02.610> more<00:03:02.700> measurements<00:03:03.260> now<00:03:04.260> those

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
can get some more measurements now those

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.740 
can get some more measurements now those
two<00:03:05.400> hot<00:03:05.640> spots<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:06.270> were<00:03:06.390> seven

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
two hot spots that were seven

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
and the one right there they seem to be

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.570 
and the one right there they seem to be
hanging<00:03:11.760> in<00:03:11.880> there<00:03:12.030> in<00:03:12.150> fact<00:03:12.450> when<00:03:13.580> the

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
microwave is running you can't see it

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.310 
microwave is running you can't see it
the<00:03:16.920> camera<00:03:17.310> can't<00:03:17.549> catch<00:03:17.820> it<00:03:18.000> very<00:03:18.209> well<00:03:18.390> but

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
the camera can't catch it very well but

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.140 
the camera can't catch it very well but
they're<00:03:19.709> bubbling<00:03:20.040> up<00:03:20.400> they're<00:03:20.670> getting<00:03:20.790> hot

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
they're bubbling up they're getting hot

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.699 
they're bubbling up they're getting hot
right<00:03:21.360> here<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:21.959> they're<00:03:22.049> getting<00:03:22.170> hot<00:03:22.470> right

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
right here and they're getting hot right

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.830 
right here and they're getting hot right
here<00:03:22.950> and<00:03:23.070> you<00:03:23.130> get<00:03:23.640> a<00:03:23.670> couple<00:03:23.910> bubbles<00:03:24.330> this

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
here and you get a couple bubbles this

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.810 
here and you get a couple bubbles this
is<00:03:25.049> still<00:03:25.290> kind<00:03:25.500> of<00:03:25.560> cold<00:03:25.769> over<00:03:26.190> here<00:03:26.489> as<00:03:26.670> you

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
is still kind of cold over here as you

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.949 
is still kind of cold over here as you
can<00:03:27.000> tell<00:03:28.190> these<00:03:29.190> two<00:03:29.549> brown<00:03:30.120> spots<00:03:30.600> might

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
can tell these two brown spots might

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.960 
can tell these two brown spots might
just<00:03:31.380> be<00:03:31.530> because<00:03:31.769> they're<00:03:32.400> close<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:32.850> the

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
just be because they're close to the

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.190 
just be because they're close to the
edge<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:33.480> they<00:03:33.570> got<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:33.750> little<00:03:33.989> hotter

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
edge and they got a little hotter

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.740 
edge and they got a little hotter
quicker<00:03:34.730> these<00:03:35.730> are<00:03:35.940> kind<00:03:36.120> of<00:03:36.209> in<00:03:36.330> the<00:03:36.450> middle

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
quicker these are kind of in the middle

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.830 
quicker these are kind of in the middle
this<00:03:37.290> I'm<00:03:37.769> I'm<00:03:38.250> most<00:03:38.610> I<00:03:39.000> think<00:03:39.450> those<00:03:39.630> are<00:03:39.780> the

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
this I'm I'm most I think those are the

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.199 
this I'm I'm most I think those are the
most<00:03:40.019> reliable<00:03:40.320> right<00:03:41.160> there<00:03:41.459> those<00:03:41.790> two<00:03:41.820> hot

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
most reliable right there those two hot

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.710 
most reliable right there those two hot
spots<00:03:42.570> and<00:03:45.950> microwaves<00:03:46.950> are<00:03:47.160> radio<00:03:47.489> waves

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
spots and microwaves are radio waves

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.350 
spots and microwaves are radio waves
they<00:03:48.720> get<00:03:48.930> hot<00:03:49.200> here<00:03:49.739> they<00:03:50.070> get<00:03:50.280> cold<00:03:50.610> out<00:03:51.030> here

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
they get hot here they get cold out here

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.390 
they get hot here they get cold out here
there<00:03:51.660> should<00:03:51.690> be<00:03:52.140> another<00:03:52.350> hot<00:03:52.650> region<00:03:53.130> over

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
there should be another hot region over

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.850 
there should be another hot region over
here<00:03:53.730> well<00:03:54.360> you<00:03:54.750> can<00:03:54.900> see<00:03:55.110> it<00:03:55.140> on<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.410> edge<00:03:55.560> but

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
here well you can see it on the edge but

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.560 
here well you can see it on the edge but
that<00:03:56.040> might<00:03:56.280> just<00:03:56.730> be<00:03:56.790> because<00:03:57.060> it's<00:03:57.420> at<00:03:57.540> the

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
that might just be because it's at the

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.930 
that might just be because it's at the
edge<00:03:57.810> that<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:58.799> glass<00:03:59.070> gets<00:03:59.430> a<00:03:59.580> little<00:03:59.730> hot

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
edge that the glass gets a little hot

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.210 
edge that the glass gets a little hot
this<00:04:00.390> glass<00:04:00.720> it's<00:04:01.530> little<00:04:01.799> hot<00:04:03.410> okay<00:04:04.410> so<00:04:05.010> for

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
this glass it's little hot okay so for

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.890 
this glass it's little hot okay so for
measuring<00:04:05.580> the<00:04:05.670> speed<00:04:05.910> of<00:04:06.060> light<00:04:06.239> I<00:04:06.450> like<00:04:06.660> this

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
measuring the speed of light I like this

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.500 
measuring the speed of light I like this
I<00:04:07.110> like<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.680> seven<00:04:08.040> centimeters<00:04:08.670> there<00:04:09.120> seven

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
I like the seven centimeters there seven

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.090 
I like the seven centimeters there seven
centimeters<00:04:10.049> apart<00:04:10.350> that's<00:04:10.650> half<00:04:10.950> a

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
centimeters apart that's half a

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.250 
centimeters apart that's half a
wavelength<00:04:11.340> that<00:04:11.880> means<00:04:12.540> a<00:04:12.720> full<00:04:12.989> wavelength

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
wavelength that means a full wavelength

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.190 
wavelength that means a full wavelength
is<00:04:13.769> 14<00:04:14.400> centimeters<00:04:15.120> next<00:04:15.930> we'll<00:04:16.049> do<00:04:16.169> the

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
is 14 centimeters next we'll do the

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.740 
is 14 centimeters next we'll do the
calculations<00:04:16.979> we<00:04:17.729> get<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.030> frequency<00:04:18.570> from

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
calculations we get the frequency from

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.589 
calculations we get the frequency from
the<00:04:18.840> back<00:04:19.109> of<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.650> microwave<00:04:20.070> oven<00:04:20.220> and<00:04:20.609> as

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
the back of the microwave oven and as

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.930 
the back of the microwave oven and as
you<00:04:21.750> can<00:04:21.870> see<00:04:22.049> from<00:04:22.169> the<00:04:22.320> picture<00:04:22.680> is

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
you can see from the picture is

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.500 
you can see from the picture is
2,450<00:04:24.940> megahertz<00:04:26.280> also<00:04:27.280> when<00:04:28.000> I<00:04:28.030> pulled<00:04:28.420> the

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
2,450 megahertz also when I pulled the

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.500 
2,450 megahertz also when I pulled the
egg<00:04:28.690> whites<00:04:28.990> out<00:04:29.260> of<00:04:29.440> the<00:04:29.530> oven<00:04:29.680> and<00:04:30.480> did<00:04:31.480> a

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
egg whites out of the oven and did a

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.290 
egg whites out of the oven and did a
very<00:04:31.630> careful<00:04:32.140> measurement<00:04:32.830> I<00:04:32.980> found<00:04:33.970> that

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
very careful measurement I found that

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.990 
very careful measurement I found that
the<00:04:34.540> distance<00:04:35.020> between<00:04:35.080> hot<00:04:35.620> spots<00:04:35.980> was<00:04:36.370> more

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
the distance between hot spots was more

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.570 
the distance between hot spots was more
like<00:04:37.240> six<00:04:37.720> centimeters<00:04:38.380> rather<00:04:38.950> than<00:04:39.130> seven

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
like six centimeters rather than seven

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.970 
like six centimeters rather than seven
centimeters<00:04:40.380> so<00:04:41.380> now<00:04:41.530> we'll<00:04:41.710> go<00:04:41.860> to<00:04:41.890> the

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
centimeters so now we'll go to the

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.770 
centimeters so now we'll go to the
calculations<00:04:43.470> from<00:04:44.470> our<00:04:44.650> microwave<00:04:45.100> we<00:04:45.490> got

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
calculations from our microwave we got

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.060 
calculations from our microwave we got
that<00:04:46.780> half<00:04:47.380> the<00:04:47.650> wavelength<00:04:49.680> was<00:04:50.680> 6

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
that half the wavelength was 6

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:56.010 
that half the wavelength was 6
centimeters<00:04:53.970> so<00:04:54.970> if<00:04:55.030> we<00:04:55.150> multiply<00:04:55.270> both<00:04:55.720> sides

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
centimeters so if we multiply both sides

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.290 
centimeters so if we multiply both sides
of<00:04:56.140> this<00:04:56.260> equation<00:04:56.560> by<00:04:56.770> 2<00:04:56.890> we<00:04:57.700> get<00:04:57.820> the<00:04:58.030> full

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
of this equation by 2 we get the full

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.590 
of this equation by 2 we get the full
wavelength<00:04:59.280> equals<00:05:00.280> 12<00:05:00.820> centimeters<00:05:03.600> which

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
wavelength equals 12 centimeters which

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:11.190 
wavelength equals 12 centimeters which
equals<00:05:06.450> 0.12<00:05:07.450> meters<00:05:08.940> the<00:05:09.940> frequency<00:05:10.570> from

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
equals 0.12 meters the frequency from

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.160 
equals 0.12 meters the frequency from
the<00:05:11.260> back<00:05:11.530> of<00:05:11.740> our<00:05:11.830> microwave<00:05:12.250> oven<00:05:12.580> was<00:05:13.180> two

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170 
the back of our microwave oven was two

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:19.250 
the back of our microwave oven was two
point<00:05:14.500> four<00:05:14.770> five<00:05:15.450> times<00:05:16.450> 10<00:05:16.930> to<00:05:17.140> the<00:05:17.170> ninth

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
point four five times 10 to the ninth

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.980 
point four five times 10 to the ninth
inverse<00:05:20.260> seconds<00:05:20.880> 10<00:05:21.880> to<00:05:21.970> the<00:05:22.060> ninth<00:05:22.240> Hertz<00:05:22.600> or

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
inverse seconds 10 to the ninth Hertz or

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.460 
inverse seconds 10 to the ninth Hertz or
inverse<00:05:23.830> seconds<00:05:24.810> the<00:05:25.810> formula<00:05:26.230> for<00:05:26.380> the

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
inverse seconds the formula for the

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.100 
inverse seconds the formula for the
speed<00:05:26.740> of<00:05:26.860> light<00:05:27.010> or<00:05:27.280> the<00:05:28.000> speed<00:05:28.419> of<00:05:28.720> any<00:05:28.870> wave

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
speed of light or the speed of any wave

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.050 
speed of light or the speed of any wave
is<00:05:29.410> wavelength<00:05:29.800> times<00:05:30.280> the<00:05:30.430> frequency<00:05:33.060> so

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
is wavelength times the frequency so

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:46.970 
is wavelength times the frequency so
let's<00:05:34.300> get<00:05:34.450> our<00:05:34.600> handy-dandy<00:05:35.260> calculator<00:05:35.530> out

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.750 

and<00:05:48.330> we<00:05:49.330> get<00:05:49.540> a<00:05:49.570> speed<00:05:49.960> of<00:05:50.080> light<00:05:50.290> of<00:05:50.530> 2.9<00:05:51.280> 4

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
and we get a speed of light of 2.9 4

00:05:51.760 --> 00:06:03.530 
and we get a speed of light of 2.9 4
times<00:05:52.090> 10<00:05:52.449> to<00:05:52.630> the<00:05:52.690> 8th<00:05:52.870> meters<00:05:52.900> per<00:05:53.830> second

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.390 

that's<00:06:04.440> pretty<00:06:05.010> good<00:06:06.440> the<00:06:07.440> accepted<00:06:07.920> value<00:06:08.070> is

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
that's pretty good the accepted value is

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.260 
that's pretty good the accepted value is
three<00:06:09.740> to<00:06:10.740> three<00:06:10.980> significant<00:06:11.640> figures<00:06:11.700> it's

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
three to three significant figures it's

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:17.300 
three to three significant figures it's
three<00:06:12.570> anyway<00:06:15.440> times<00:06:16.440> ten<00:06:16.710> the<00:06:16.860> eighth<00:06:17.010> meters

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310

three anyway times ten the eighth meters
per<00:06:17.730> second<00:06:18.680> we<00:06:19.680> did<00:06:19.830> pretty<00:06:19.980> good<00:06:20.100> with<00:06:20.250> our
