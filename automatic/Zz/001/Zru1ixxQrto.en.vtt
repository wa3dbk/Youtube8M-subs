anyone<00:00:28.640> is<00:00:28.689> aware<00:00:29.689> of<00:00:29.750> it<00:00:30.110> even<00:00:30.349> in<00:00:30.470> the<00:00:30.590> field

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860 
anyone is aware of it even in the field

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.150 
anyone is aware of it even in the field
of<00:00:31.130> clinical<00:00:31.939> neurology<00:00:32.599> but<00:00:32.840> in<00:00:32.960> the

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
of clinical neurology but in the

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.740 
of clinical neurology but in the
neurosciences<00:00:34.160> it's<00:00:34.400> a<00:00:34.520> very<00:00:34.880> intense<00:00:35.420> hot

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
neurosciences it's a very intense hot

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.860 
neurosciences it's a very intense hot
area<00:00:36.200> of<00:00:36.350> research<00:00:39.310> basically<00:00:40.310> why<00:00:40.850> I<00:00:40.880> assume

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
area of research basically why I assume

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.950 
area of research basically why I assume
that<00:00:42.110> at<00:00:42.350> least<00:00:42.530> you<00:00:42.890> have<00:00:43.550> some<00:00:43.970> basic<00:00:44.570> idea

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
that at least you have some basic idea

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.810 
that at least you have some basic idea
of<00:00:45.020> excited<00:00:45.500> toxicity<00:00:46.250> that's<00:00:46.460> why<00:00:46.610> you're

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
of excited toxicity that's why you're

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.550 
of excited toxicity that's why you're
attending<00:00:47.120> this<00:00:47.360> lecture<00:00:47.840> but<00:00:48.050> excited

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:48.560 
attending this lecture but excited

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.490 
attending this lecture but excited
toxicity<00:00:49.370> is<00:00:49.550> a<00:00:50.120> process<00:00:50.930> where<00:00:51.290> the

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
toxicity is a process where the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.340 
toxicity is a process where the
glutamate<00:00:52.450> neurotransmission<00:00:53.450> receptors

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
glutamate neurotransmission receptors

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.740 
glutamate neurotransmission receptors
are<00:00:54.650> being<00:00:55.340> over<00:00:55.700> stimulated<00:00:56.480> and<00:00:56.630> it

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
are being over stimulated and it

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.830 
are being over stimulated and it
produces<00:00:57.440> a<00:00:57.880> process<00:00:58.880> of<00:00:59.150> gradual

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
produces a process of gradual

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.740 
produces a process of gradual
destruction<00:01:00.140> of<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.430> synaptic<00:01:02.120> connections

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
destruction of the synaptic connections

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.749 
destruction of the synaptic connections
and<00:01:02.990> the<00:01:03.110> dendrites<00:01:03.650> it<00:01:04.640> also<00:01:05.000> results<00:01:05.600> and

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
and the dendrites it also results and

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.399 
and the dendrites it also results and
eventual<00:01:07.759> loss<00:01:07.820> of<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.329> neuron<00:01:08.720> if<00:01:08.900> it's<00:01:09.079> very

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
eventual loss of the neuron if it's very

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.069 
eventual loss of the neuron if it's very
intense<00:01:10.150> so<00:01:11.150> what<00:01:11.420> we're<00:01:11.600> going<00:01:11.720> to<00:01:11.810> talk

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:12.079 
intense so what we're going to talk

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:13.870 
intense so what we're going to talk
about<00:01:12.290> is<00:01:12.650> some<00:01:12.890> of<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.070> things<00:01:13.340> that<00:01:13.490> excite

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880

discovered<00:07:12.330> if<00:07:12.419> you<00:07:12.540> block<00:07:12.840> glutamate

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:13.470 
discovered if you block glutamate

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.950 
discovered if you block glutamate
receptors<00:07:14.130> you<00:07:14.310> block<00:07:14.580> most<00:07:14.910> of<00:07:15.060> the<00:07:15.150> toxicity

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 
receptors you block most of the toxicity

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.900 
receptors you block most of the toxicity

this<00:07:30.930> is<00:07:31.110> slices<00:07:31.680> of<00:07:31.890> the<00:07:32.990> hypothalamus

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:33.990 
this is slices of the hypothalamus

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.990 
this is slices of the hypothalamus
particularly<00:07:34.980> in<00:07:35.100> the<00:07:35.160> area<00:07:35.460> of<00:07:35.490> the<00:07:35.610> arcuate

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 
particularly in the area of the arcuate

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.600 
particularly in the area of the arcuate
nucleus<00:07:36.120> and<00:07:36.840> what<00:07:37.470> it<00:07:37.620> shows<00:07:37.919> is<00:07:37.950> that<00:07:38.310> this

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:38.610 
nucleus and what it shows is that this

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.820 
nucleus and what it shows is that this
is<00:07:38.760> the<00:07:38.880> normal<00:07:39.120> looking<00:07:39.650> hypothalamus<00:07:40.650> in

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:40.830 
is the normal looking hypothalamus in

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.250 
is the normal looking hypothalamus in

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:43.260 
that area within about two or three

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.370 
that area within about two or three
hours<00:07:43.500> you<00:07:44.040> get<00:07:44.570> widespread<00:07:45.570> edema<00:07:46.020> and

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:46.380 
hours you get widespread edema and

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.500 
hours you get widespread edema and
beginning<00:07:47.190> destruction<00:07:47.820> of<00:07:47.940> these<00:07:48.060> neurons

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:48.510 
beginning destruction of these neurons

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:51.170 
beginning destruction of these neurons
here<00:07:49.500> this<00:07:49.740> is<00:07:49.919> filled<00:07:50.220> with<00:07:50.340> activated

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:51.180 
here this is filled with activated

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.290 
here this is filled with activated
microglia<00:07:51.540> that's<00:07:52.970> continuing<00:07:53.970> the<00:07:54.090> process

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:54.300 
microglia that's continuing the process

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.750 
microglia that's continuing the process
and<00:07:55.080> then<00:07:55.500> here<00:07:55.710> you<00:07:55.860> see<00:07:56.040> almost<00:07:56.340> all<00:07:56.550> the

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:56.760 
and then here you see almost all the

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.610 
and then here you see almost all the
neurons<00:07:56.970> have<00:07:57.300> been<00:07:57.479> destroyed<00:07:57.960> in<00:07:58.169> that<00:07:58.200> part

00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:58.620 
neurons have been destroyed in that part

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.180 
neurons have been destroyed in that part
of<00:07:58.710> the<00:07:58.860> brain<00:07:59.010> this<00:07:59.880> is<00:07:59.940> what<00:08:00.330> the<00:08:00.479> dose<00:08:00.750> of

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:01.190 
of the brain this is what the dose of

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.560 
of the brain this is what the dose of
glutamate<00:08:02.190> that's<00:08:02.490> equal<00:08:02.850> to<00:08:02.970> what<00:08:03.180> human

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:03.570 
glutamate that's equal to what human

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:07.100 
glutamate that's equal to what human
