00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:16.089
 Hello and welcome dear spectators to the SuS CC Hall through the 

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:19.669
 Monitor last week, Bonn is to wheat the forest fires in Russia 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:22.949
 Thielemann wheat price in the amount today we would have once again the 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.649
 Gold price the price of the precious metal rose in the last twelve months and 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:32.360
 30 percent current gold price near the year highs 1000 200 and 65 dollars 

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:35.359
 zanter Einzel about the reasons for the price increase 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.640
 At the beginning of the week, the gold price climbed to its highest level 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.820
 beginning of July 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.450
 The troy ounce cost just under $ 1,000 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.180
 Gold is again targeting the annual high of June 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.370
 responsible for the recent price increase are apparently 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.560
 disappointing economic data 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.080
 For example, the Empa Estate Index has risen less than experts 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.880
 expected and also the data from Japan disappointed 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.590
 the economy grew significantly less in the second quarter than 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.610
 expected 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.990
 This is saying that China can not keep its pace of growth, investors let 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.990
 once again flee the gold harbor in the tens of years 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.939
 Analysts expect that the price increase will continue 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.600
 exceeding the mark of $ 1000 220 has triggered a buy signal 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.700
 the price of gold rises above $ 1,000 $ 230 with follow-on purchases 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.630
 count and the year high would back again a bit closer 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.800
 and about the gold price I speak now with Uwe Bergold of Gera Asset 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.130
 Management GmbH 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.189
 Since Gold, the price of gold has recently reached just under $ 1,000,230 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.180
 highest since the beginning of July what are in the frets for the clear 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.170
 Rise in the price of gold in recent months 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.680
 reason raised here is of course the excess liquidity worldwide 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.970
 which due to the stimulation people since the founding of Coll political murder 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.840
 former spot will be and will show effect 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.840
 the gold price anticipates this Megan must 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:11.790
 Sda Investor George Soros is also always more money in the 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.609
 precious metals 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:15.839
 what does a well-stocked depot look like in your opinion 

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:20.329
 So here I come as I said we have set up a new concept with Brauner 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:23.849
 At least in front of the crowd, up to 30 patients fall into physical precious metals 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.110
 invested 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.819
 I would recommend him »10 to 30 percent 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.890
 10% cash flow could also increase individual risk appetite 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.510
 and there you should get him well sorted diversified commodities company 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.809
 Put all the games for big good dividend titles 

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:43.119
 Here, of course, to the focus percent me especially on gold and 

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:46.089
 Silver mine sect liters are coming 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:49.329
 Now, short-term oriented investors might be able to increase the rise of the 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.689
 Use last week's gold price and maybe take profits 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:56.119
 So the question is perhaps the correction is already approaching 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:59.809
 So here I would be very wary confusion 16 9 redevelop gold market 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:02.749
 invests and uses heat in «Milk» culture 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:06.279
 For very cheap still buying opportunity also current the situation would be so 

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:07.339
 assess 

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:11.180
 Amon should not be here specifically for gold as a strategic investment 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:14.439
 Try to feed him profits but rather polish it yet 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:15.779
 See buying opportunity 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:18.849
 in return, this would also facilitate gold mines where they have a higher 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.579
 Have volatility and gold hardly say "the very cheap 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.519
 also buying opportunity 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.420
 Here again to India, the wedding season is rough and traditional 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:30.670
 that parties gifted India with gold jewelry 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.199
 this may also affect the price of gold 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:37.549
 Year her son is such a fact we are almost in front of her and she rather haltingly 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.299
 speaks very very so nine months 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.400
 If august is usually going on then the wedding season is supported 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.870
 strongest period strongest Holger at Golden at the precious metals there concerts 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.409
 Operas Wust September 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:53.379
 from the critic and UGT clock to January Bavarian-Bohemian to date 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.930
 at a new, very opportune moment for one 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:01.469
 but we have been very positive for Gold and at Holger for the benefit of Holger 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:02.589
 the ion with great 

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:06.279
 and here, of course, the seasonality draws in me 

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:07.699
 come 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:10.399
 then, of course, there is the question how can it be longer term 

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:12.859
 continue with the precious metal 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:16.519
 So here too we see very positive assessment the last ten 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.959
 We choose new ones again and again since the year 2000 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.610
 another casting instead of the bull and the gold 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.220
 The Bull Mottet continues even when she walks trees or cultures like 

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:29.270
 currently the culture comes short-term farther north leads the films 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.279
 could also show big 

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:33.840
 a recourse target the firing already the Norton 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.610
 I think about midterm strength the next twelve months but could 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.279
 with good chances to go the deaths of thousands 

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:43.969
 In the end, if the goldless blobs would be popular place to in this decade 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:46.969
 nature so if you see gold people 5000 us dollars 

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:52.069
 So you're currently looking at a course 10m want this at 5000 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:56.069
 if any of the development in this decade i think sure we're over 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:58.759
 5000 will rise 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.759
 Market superimposed on many thanks 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.650
 So far as the current issue of the raw material you can look up something 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.310
 this us all other broadcasts at any time on the Internet at www 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.260
 he is coming on 26 Novus because hopefully with a new edition 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:16.669
 again, until then jazz and what you see there
