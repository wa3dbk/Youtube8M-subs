00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
mostly going to be painting and flocking

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.510 
mostly going to be painting and flocking
that<00:05:02.810> makes<00:05:02.960> this<00:05:03.080> one<00:05:03.320> really<00:05:03.530> good<00:05:03.830> because

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
that makes this one really good because

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.340 
that makes this one really good because
it's<00:05:04.760> going<00:05:04.850> to<00:05:04.910> be<00:05:05.060> like<00:05:05.180> black<00:05:05.570> oily<00:05:06.140> water

a still work in progress I still have to
build<00:06:45.770> off<00:06:45.920> all<00:06:46.100> this<00:06:46.340> but<00:06:46.580> this<00:06:46.670> is

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:46.730 
build off all this but this is

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.280 
build off all this but this is
essentially<00:06:47.210> a<00:06:47.240> motor<00:06:47.480> Forge<00:06:47.750> it's<00:06:47.990> what<00:06:48.110> lets

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:48.290 
essentially a motor Forge it's what lets

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.540 
essentially a motor Forge it's what lets
you<00:06:48.410> get<00:06:48.500> down<00:06:48.680> to<00:06:48.860> Ozzie<00:06:48.980> and<00:06:49.280> get<00:06:49.400> to<00:06:49.520> your

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550 
you get down to Ozzie and get to your

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.160 
you get down to Ozzie and get to your
upgrades<00:06:50.000> fine<00:06:50.360> meats<00:06:50.570> all<00:06:50.660> over<00:06:50.900> the<00:06:50.990> place

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:51.170 
upgrades fine meats all over the place

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:52.930
