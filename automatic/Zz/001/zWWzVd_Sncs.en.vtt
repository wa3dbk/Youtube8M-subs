00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.410 
that here to oklahoma state and that
next<00:03:01.310> level<00:03:01.430> obviously<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:02.000> windows<00:03:02.269> are

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
next level obviously the windows are

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.660 
next level obviously the windows are
smaller<00:03:02.660> everybody<00:03:03.110> asstard<00:03:03.560> bigger<00:03:03.769> so<00:03:04.100> when

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
smaller everybody asstard bigger so when

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.380 
smaller everybody asstard bigger so when
those<00:03:04.790> are<00:03:04.850> going<00:03:04.940> to<00:03:05.000> be<00:03:05.060> a<00:03:05.150> little<00:03:05.269> bit

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
those are going to be a little bit

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.449 
those are going to be a little bit
tighter<00:03:05.630> at<00:03:05.780> that<00:03:05.900> level<00:03:06.080> and<00:03:06.739> so<00:03:07.130> fortunate

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
tighter at that level and so fortunate

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.910
