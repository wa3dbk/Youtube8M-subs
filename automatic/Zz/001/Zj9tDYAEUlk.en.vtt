protection<00:01:16.170> obviously<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:17.100> pretty<00:01:17.430> good

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
protection obviously a pretty good

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.100 
protection obviously a pretty good
amount<00:01:17.790> I'll<00:01:18.090> be<00:01:18.270> laying<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.570> table<00:01:18.689> design

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
amount I'll be laying the table design

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.050 
amount I'll be laying the table design
now<00:01:19.290> another<00:01:19.560> really<00:01:19.920> cool<00:01:20.159> feature<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.640> this

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
now another really cool feature is this

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.929 
now another really cool feature is this
built-in<00:01:21.540> audio<00:01:21.900> app<00:01:22.130> which<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.369> direct

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
built-in audio app which is a direct

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.510 
built-in audio app which is a direct
channel<00:01:24.420> audio<00:01:24.780> design<00:01:25.290> which<00:01:25.619> does<00:01:25.920> boost<00:01:26.280> up

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
channel audio design which does boost up

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.660 
channel audio design which does boost up
the<00:01:26.549> audio<00:01:26.790> performance<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.479> little<00:01:28.430> but<00:01:29.430> I

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
the audio performance a little but I

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.520 
the audio performance a little but I
mean<00:01:29.909> obviously<00:01:30.000> can<00:01:30.689> expect<00:01:31.049> something<00:01:31.290> too

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
mean obviously can expect something too

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.420 
mean obviously can expect something too
major<00:01:31.710> but<00:01:32.159> obviously<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.270> does<00:01:33.509> add<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.860> pretty

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
major but obviously it does add a pretty

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.450 
major but obviously it does add a pretty
good<00:01:35.579> amount<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.450> volume<00:01:37.229> increase<00:01:37.680> with

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
good amount of a volume increase with

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.370 
good amount of a volume increase with
that<00:01:38.670> channel<00:01:39.000> design<00:01:39.119> overall<00:01:39.720> I'm<00:01:39.960> super

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
that channel design overall I'm super

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.530 
that channel design overall I'm super
happy<00:01:40.500> with<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.920> case<00:01:41.150> it's<00:01:42.150> fully

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
happy with the case it's fully

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.420 
happy with the case it's fully
functional<00:01:42.869> with<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.290> really<00:01:43.770> nice<00:01:43.950> design<00:01:44.399> i
