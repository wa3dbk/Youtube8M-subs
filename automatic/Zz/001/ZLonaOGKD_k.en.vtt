the evils in the world I would do my

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.040 
the evils in the world I would do my
best<00:05:33.680> I<00:05:34.310> would<00:05:34.370> try<00:05:34.610> my<00:05:34.640> hardest<00:05:35.120> to<00:05:35.420> do<00:05:35.570> it<00:05:35.600> but

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
best I would try my hardest to do it but

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.800 
best I would try my hardest to do it but
in<00:05:36.350> doing<00:05:36.860> so<00:05:37.070> that<00:05:37.790> might<00:05:38.030> cause<00:05:38.330> even<00:05:38.780> more

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
in doing so that might cause even more

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.200 
in doing so that might cause even more
trouble<00:05:39.110> for<00:05:39.890> the<00:05:40.100> world<00:05:40.310> the<00:05:40.580> world<00:05:40.610> needs<00:05:41.090> a

trouble for the world the world needs a

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.700 
trouble for the world the world needs a
balance<00:05:41.360> of<00:05:41.630> good<00:05:41.870> and<00:05:42.020> evil<00:05:42.140> if<00:05:42.380> you<00:05:42.470> take

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
balance of good and evil if you take

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.320 
balance of good and evil if you take
away<00:05:42.860> the<00:05:43.070> evil<00:05:43.220> it<00:05:43.520> throws<00:05:43.760> everything<00:05:44.090> into

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
away the evil it throws everything into
