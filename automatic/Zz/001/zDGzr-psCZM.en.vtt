00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
that's nap got it

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.190 
that's nap got it
I<00:02:11.760> thought<00:02:12.760> we<00:02:12.910> played<00:02:12.940> excellent<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:13.780> mean<00:02:14.110> we

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
I thought we played excellent I mean we

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.229 
I thought we played excellent I mean we
really<00:02:14.349> did<00:02:14.620> I<00:02:14.830> think<00:02:15.280> we<00:02:15.370> dominated<00:02:15.879> him<00:02:16.090> up

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
really did I think we dominated him up

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.290 
really did I think we dominated him up
front<00:02:16.540> um<00:02:16.830> we<00:02:17.830> stop<00:02:18.160> their<00:02:18.580> run<00:02:18.790> game<00:02:18.819> for<00:02:19.239> the

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
front um we stop their run game for the

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.710 
front um we stop their run game for the
most<00:02:19.480> part<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:21.370> know<00:02:21.489> that<00:02:21.790> they<00:02:21.970> they're<00:02:22.360> a

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
most part you know that they they're a

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.259 
most part you know that they they're a
good<00:02:23.319> offense<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:24.129> very<00:02:24.459> good<00:02:24.640> offense<00:02:25.060> and

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
good offense a very good offense and

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.150 
good offense a very good offense and
it's<00:02:25.510> hard<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.780> prepare<00:02:25.959> for<00:02:26.349> you<00:02:26.830> know<00:02:26.950> that

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
it's hard to prepare for you know that

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.620 
it's hard to prepare for you know that
with<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.459> misdirection<00:02:27.910> but<00:02:28.239> I<00:02:28.269> think<00:02:28.540> our

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
with the misdirection but I think our

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.070 
with the misdirection but I think our
defense<00:02:28.750> did<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.140> great<00:02:29.500> job<00:02:30.599> you<00:02:31.599> know<00:02:31.720> we<00:02:31.959> just

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
defense did a great job you know we just

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.360 
defense did a great job you know we just
have<00:02:32.230> way<00:02:32.380> too<00:02:32.440> many<00:02:32.620> penalties<00:02:32.860> it<00:02:33.280> was

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
have way too many penalties it was

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.740 
have way too many penalties it was
obvious<00:02:33.700> we<00:02:33.790> have<00:02:33.910> four<00:02:34.090> touchdowns<00:02:34.540> call

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
obvious we have four touchdowns call

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.440 
obvious we have four touchdowns call
back<00:02:34.959> so<00:02:35.739> we<00:02:36.099> made<00:02:36.340> this<00:02:36.519> game<00:02:36.730> closer<00:02:37.090> that<00:02:37.390> I

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
back so we made this game closer that I

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.110 
back so we made this game closer that I
think<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:37.780> really<00:02:37.810> was<00:02:38.170> is<00:02:39.130> that<00:02:39.310> a<00:02:39.340> just<00:02:39.970> a

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
think it really was is that a just a

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.000 
think it really was is that a just a
lack<00:02:40.299> of<00:02:40.330> this<00:02:40.599> on<00:02:40.989> the<00:02:41.110> team<00:02:41.290> yeah<00:02:41.739> absolutely

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010
