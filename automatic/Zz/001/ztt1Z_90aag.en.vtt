would indeed and I think that this is

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.150 
would indeed and I think that this is
something<00:00:06.810> that<00:00:06.960> we<00:00:07.140> must<00:00:07.290> all<00:00:07.620> do<00:00:07.859> in<00:00:08.040> this

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160

something that we must all do in this
day<00:00:08.400> and<00:00:08.429> age<00:00:08.670> I<00:00:08.910> think<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.210> Quentin<00:00:09.480> is<00:00:09.570> going

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599

it's<00:00:37.980> possible<00:00:38.520> quite<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.879> do<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
it's possible quite to do this and the

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
to them was that there was a procedure

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.139 
to them was that there was a procedure
in<00:01:15.140> those<00:01:15.350> four<00:01:15.680> bars<00:01:15.890> which<00:01:16.159> if<00:01:16.460> intentional

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
in those four bars which if intentional

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.600 
in those four bars which if intentional
on<00:01:17.810> Beethoven's<00:01:18.380> part<00:01:18.590> and<00:01:18.740> and<00:01:18.979> I<00:01:19.280> was<00:01:19.460> not

on Beethoven's part and and I was not

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.219 
on Beethoven's part and and I was not
there<00:01:19.759> to<00:01:19.820> judge<00:01:20.090> whether<00:01:20.330> it<00:01:20.479> was<00:01:20.600> or<00:01:20.750> not<00:01:20.840> but

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
there to judge whether it was or not but

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.889 
there to judge whether it was or not but
if<00:01:21.409> intentional<00:01:22.040> was<00:01:22.729> one<00:01:22.940> of<00:01:23.030> those<00:01:23.149> moments

themes in the readings of the material
yesterday<00:02:01.700> it's<00:02:01.909> like<00:02:02.060> what<00:02:02.240> Beethoven<00:02:02.840> did

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
yesterday it's like what Beethoven did

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.420 
yesterday it's like what Beethoven did
where<00:02:03.350> he<00:02:03.380> wasn't<00:02:03.680> even<00:02:03.860> concerned<00:02:04.189> about

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
where he wasn't even concerned about

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.590 
where he wasn't even concerned about
themes<00:02:04.670> in<00:02:04.880> fact<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.119> whole<00:02:05.240> movement<00:02:05.450> is

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
themes in fact the whole movement is

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.389 
themes in fact the whole movement is
rather<00:02:05.840> a<00:02:05.930> thematic<00:02:06.320> in<00:02:06.710> that<00:02:06.860> sense<00:02:07.070> er<00:02:07.159> no

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
rather a thematic in that sense er no

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.249 
rather a thematic in that sense er no
really<00:02:07.759> good<00:02:07.909> to<00:02:08.179> nothing<00:02:08.600> he<00:02:08.660> whistles<00:02:09.110> on<00:02:09.229> it

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
really good to nothing he whistles on it

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.990 
really good to nothing he whistles on it
and<00:02:09.769> not<00:02:09.950> even<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.250> chorale<00:02:10.489> tune<00:02:10.519> because

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
and not even the chorale tune because

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.819 
and not even the chorale tune because
it's<00:02:11.180> inserting<00:02:13.180> but<00:02:14.180> what<00:02:14.299> he<00:02:14.390> did<00:02:14.600> in<00:02:14.780> fact

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
it's inserting but what he did in fact

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:18.100 
it's inserting but what he did in fact
was<00:02:15.829> to<00:02:16.280> be<00:02:16.790> interested<00:02:17.239> in<00:02:17.360> progression

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
was to be interested in progression

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.569 
was to be interested in progression
which<00:02:18.260> is<00:02:18.410> to<00:02:18.530> say<00:02:18.709> not<00:02:18.890> only<00:02:18.920> in<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.340> bass

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
which is to say not only in the bass

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:21.069 
which is to say not only in the bass
notes<00:02:19.880> but<00:02:20.120> in<00:02:20.239> the<00:02:20.360> notes<00:02:20.540> that<00:02:20.720> actually

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079 
notes but in the notes that actually

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:26.830 
notes but in the notes that actually
fall<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:24.350> to<00:02:25.250> put<00:02:26.090> a<00:02:26.120> mirror<00:02:26.329> to<00:02:26.510> this<00:02:26.630> and

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
fall and to put a mirror to this and

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.199 
fall and to put a mirror to this and
turn<00:02:27.200> a<00:02:27.230> progression<00:02:27.650> entirely<00:02:28.310> upside<00:02:28.910> down

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
turn a progression entirely upside down

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:29.979 
turn a progression entirely upside down
from<00:02:29.720> it

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
from it

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.630 
from it
we<00:02:30.140> know<00:02:30.350> that<00:02:30.650> in<00:02:31.010> these<00:02:31.100> later<00:02:31.340> years<00:02:31.579> that

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
we know that in these later years that

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.160 
we know that in these later years that
Beethoven<00:02:31.970> became<00:02:32.420> very<00:02:32.630> interested<00:02:32.959> in<00:02:33.049> this

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
Beethoven became very interested in this

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.170 
Beethoven became very interested in this
kind<00:02:33.500> of<00:02:33.739> numerological<00:02:34.609> track<00:02:34.820> I<00:02:34.850> mean<00:02:34.970> we

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
kind of numerological track I mean we

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.140 
kind of numerological track I mean we
have<00:02:35.329> a<00:02:35.510> lot<00:02:35.959> of<00:02:35.989> evidence<00:02:36.230> for<00:02:36.500> that<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:37.519> the

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
have a lot of evidence for that the the

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.729 
have a lot of evidence for that the the
hammer<00:02:38.299> clavier<00:02:38.600> Sonata<00:02:39.049> has<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.230> field<00:02:39.560> for

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
hammer clavier Sonata has a field for

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.560 
hammer clavier Sonata has a field for
instance<00:02:39.829> which<00:02:40.190> at<00:02:40.760> a<00:02:40.850> certain<00:02:41.150> point<00:02:41.269> if<00:02:41.450> you

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
indeed hold up a mirror to it you will

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.240 
indeed hold up a mirror to it you will
find<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.390> statement<00:02:45.140> of<00:02:45.230> a<00:02:45.680> very<00:02:45.950> long

Beethoven<00:03:00.700> was<00:03:00.819> about<00:03:01.060> these<00:03:01.209> things<00:03:01.420> whether

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
Beethoven was about these things whether

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.059 
Beethoven was about these things whether
he<00:03:01.780> wanted<00:03:02.049> us<00:03:02.140> to<00:03:02.200> notice<00:03:02.560> them<00:03:02.709> whether<00:03:02.890> he
