00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:14.169
 but I welcome you to a new broadcast this old when they are women of 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:18.230
 Today I would like to send you a 22 inch touch monitor 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.480
 Introducing the company Fantec and what I want to do now is you 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.880
 Molitor view meals so he just sees what the monitor is doing 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.020
 has to offer outside and then we look at our sections of the monitor numbers 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.970
 a little closer 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.790
 The 22 inch Touch Moly Tour by Falls Falls offers an aspect ratio of 16 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.580
 10 10 a physical resolution of a thousand 650 mAh thousand 50 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.500
 and can represent at most thousands only 20-times a thousand 200 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.550
 the taz weakens shared Smole Tors is over a five Trotter it's Teva 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.260
 Torch foil allows 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.070
 cheap solutions usually set four treads alone is the 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.180
 Precision is not as high as this five-degree solution 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.120
 Telecom calls on the input to adjust the volume 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.740
 switch between channels and call the menu and of course the 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.590
 Turn the gear on and off 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.360
 The monitor can be set up either with the supplied stand 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.710
 be or 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.280
 one uses the corresponding ones of these screw connections on the back SMI 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.200
 Weser hundred screwing 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.520
 to operate the monitors have to operate over a monitor 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.460
 on the back we have a usb connection for the chat function 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.470
 Audio inputs a connector for an input whip 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.180
 then act VBA kick-off and the TV Jahn flows and the power connection 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.510
 Over the cable whip you can add two extra video signals into the 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.150
 Feed the monitor 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.520
 This of course gives this ritual a huge spectrum 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.710
 various devices you can connect 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.830
 and can be very easy on these single prayers front with the input hostel too 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.170
 to grab 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.170
 these are the two speakers once left and right 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.749
 and this is an alternative Poos stand over the Weser 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:15.929
 Fastening were fastened 

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:20.919
 Now a few more technical details the case 51 4 times 5 times 33 

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:24.009
 Comano in seven inches tall 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:25.330
 the monitor weighs 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.540
 five Kommer 4 5 kilos and consumes 30 watts in standby each a bath 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:38.109
 The monitor has a horizontal viewing angle of 170 degrees vertically 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.109
 a hundred 60 percent 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.510
 so now I want to look at the monitors the TASH function 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.710
 Gemen the calibrated 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.660
 and how to make other settings to the monitors accordingly 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:03:01.209
 the chat function is done via USB and under Windows is Linux and Apple 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.479
 runnable 

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:06.889
 The monitor is shipped percent commented out before you can do it all 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.769
 corresponding goals over these four points government 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.620
 to calibrate or if you really want to have it very precisely 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.659
 You can also do a 25 points clarification 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.799
 about the us went display you have access to the most important 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.029
 Settings of the monitor and can here Brightness contrast color temperature 

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:29.409
 and many more settings 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.699
 so now with the again look at the well appropriate content on the 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:34.410
 Monitor are displayed 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.190
 and how well you can use the chat function, for example, to enter 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.529
 Mediacenter to use 

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:43.389
 yes it looks like the whole thing when you run normal TV program on it 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.389
 lets refer fried egg to the current one 

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:51.749
 Jahn's a real strength, the monitor can really show 

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:55.169
 and if you use Windows 7 in the case, for example, and only has 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:58.639
 nice virtual keyboard at the beginning that was not all over again 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:02.159
 That was exactly what Schulze Bordeaux was all about 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.459
 I would like to take a closer look in the future 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.629
 then we have the Mediacenter here 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:10.930
 and that makes it really fun so there you can really clean with the 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.930
 Swipe your fingers through the menus 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.849
 you can really operate all areas with your finger 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.389
 Should I just talk to myself for a moment? 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.270
 so that Anton gets an impression 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.310
 the easy and intuitive 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.120
 the waitresses, like the desired surface, each run their fingers 

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:35.069
 I would like to emphasize again briefly that the Fed would have no goal without 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:38.069
 Multitabs Spieker Monitor is 

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:37.629
 Solms the ball back to the best of times 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.469
 and start Mar 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:42.469
 a web browser and loading my page 

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:47.679
 necessarily that in the case again with Hot leads Schulke board what is really 

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:51.219
 the best virtual keyboard solution currently available on the market 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:53.969
 There are a lot of different keywords here 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:55.439
 can fade in 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:59.189
 It also supports if the screen supports multi-touch 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:09.110
 Who could see the vines is a great way to put their bets in 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.110
 Basically the complete keyboard 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.620
 you just need this virtual keyboard or the media center and could be one 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.339
 All-rounders and fingers succumbed 

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:21.489
 and that works wonderfully who is wonderful as Mediacenter operation 

00:06:21.489 --> 00:06:24.129
 can be used or, for example, in the kitchen 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:29.229
 To call unprofitable or simply access your media data to watch TV 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:30.669
 start and finish 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:34.660
 So percent I like it really well in the place I just have to say that 

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:37.590
 the 64-bit drivers for Mac OS x 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.920
 not yet mature, they are currently not really working 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:44.640
 one hundred percent I'm still back and forth with the developers and Armani more 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:45.400
 write 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.740
 To get it running on Windows, it all works without problems 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:55.240
 Mac OS x in 32 bit is also no problem and I think that the 64-bit 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.080
 implementation 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.849
 In any case, it will work one hundred percent in the next few months 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:04.690
 what is today to the day Schmuli gate of Ferit Tarak until the next broadcast 

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:07.369
 Jost 

00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:12.559
 no matter where he sees and I hope that freeze Scarponi has rated and around 

00:07:12.559 --> 00:07:15.559
 developed accordingly at the channel 

00:07:24.999 --> 00:07:27.999
 October 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.979
 there
