00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.699
 evening listen to a 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:19.270
 would have I would say full of 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:20.680
 twists so i guess have the 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.940
 victory but of course also the serious 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.730
 jérémy clément's wound 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.810
 the victory she will not be telling you 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.600
 honestly I would have preferred to lose the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.980
 match that to lose to Jeremy here I 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.080
 do not have to comment on the gesture I have not 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.400
 saw I simply saw the state of the 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.430
 ankle 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.450
 we are on a double fracture mont pretty 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.059
 honestly it's going to be difficult to 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.980
 talk football because honestly 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.559
 as much the fans are happy it is 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.610
 normal the club head but I would have 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.879
 preferred to lose the game than to lose a 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.260
 player 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.260
 thank you thank you christophe 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.009
 yes I am with the Nice captain a 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.960
 difficult evening for nice evening 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.759
 complicated we start very badly the match 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.460
 we take a goal quickly you find 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:14.070
 at 10 against a team in confidence 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.830
 1 0 it can still go as soon as it puts 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.270
 the second is this property and I 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.649
 believe that you fall tonight the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.990
 fifth place in any case there is a 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.369
 match against montpellier 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.789
 which would be important for Nice 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.369
 yeah that's after it changes not the 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.500
 things we said we want to be placed 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.590
 five games from the end and see so 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.420
 this is a defeat against a 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.280
 competitor it's true they were 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.780
 just behind us but it's still three 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.780
 thank you points didier 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.380
 yes I am with the captain 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.720
 of course satisfied with the victory but 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.820
 certainly sad to see that is the 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.240
 serious injury of his teammate Jeremy 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.910
 clement 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.520
 yeah that's what I was going to say we're 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.170
 happy with the victory but very 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.240
 unfortunate by what happened to for 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.700
 what happened to Jeremy so that's it 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.619
 it's terrible but hey we'll 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.500
 support and what's good is that we 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.000
 has not been deconcentrated 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.310
 we managed a nice performance yeah 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.690
 you remained focused all a state 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.610
 a numerical superiority 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.440
 how can we recover from this 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.160
 serious injury of jeremy clement in the 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.239
 head of your teammates 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.060
 finally I know what it is 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.810
 always difficult to have him 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.950
 solid but hey we'll be there for him 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.550
 it was a super complicated moment for 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.460
 a soccer player 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.560
 eh ben 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.720
 we are sad but he will get by 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.160
 you're engaged on three tables the 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.970
 cup of france the cup of the league is 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.940
 also the championship 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.140
 do you have a priority no we do not have 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.600
 first two guests we will try 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.380
 to go as far as possible in these 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.900
 three competitions 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.900
