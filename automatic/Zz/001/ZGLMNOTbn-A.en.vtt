00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:08.919

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.129
 hello lisa you want me to explain you 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.080
 how agitated atopic dermatitis 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.450
 you know the little red buttons on your 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.310
 hello skin prove their pretty skin yes 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:29.539
 explain to me that atopic dermatitis 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:31.910
 done on me atopic dermatitis the 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.710
 little red buttons and that's it 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.109
 skin and as a wall that protects your 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.940
 house from the outside sometimes some 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:39.469
 walls are more fragile and protects less 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.050
 well the house against what comes from 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:44.359
 outside like dust the cold the 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.769
 wind water for children who have a 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:46.129
 Atopic dermatitis is a bit the same 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:48.589
 thing 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.120
 their skin is more fragile and drier 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:51.979
 than that of the other children 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.719
 it is less resistant and protects you 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:55.729
 less well that's why and sometimes 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.699
 my apple to scratch that but I 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:00.260
 exactly lisa and this can be for 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.519
 different reasons 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.110
 when the temperature changes very quickly 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:07.939
 admit when you take off your clothes 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.899
 because they are not talented enough 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:16.789
 fraud on your skin yes I see when you 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:18.049
 take a bath too hot when you're 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:19.939
 ready for a cat for some children 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.420
 but you are not necessarily allergic to 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:25.219
 your cat or so when you sit on 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.469
 an old carpet for example on board it's 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:29.659
 because of the mites they are small 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:31.429
 beasts that we can not see and who 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.229
 likes to live in stoves or 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:34.759
 dust 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.549
 do not worry they are really 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.289
 little tiny little but lisa like 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.270
 your skin is more fragile than that of 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.009
 tom they can do bobo to your skin the 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.719
 little red button is forming which 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.670
 itches a lot we call that 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:48.109
 outbreaks of eczema 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.640
 it's the exam that makes you want 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:52.310
 to scratch you and how they arrive 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.999
 eczema eczema can come for 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.149
 many reasons 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:58.719
 we can not predict everything sometimes 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.729
 can come because you are 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.770
 just pissed off or when you get out of the 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.329
 pool because of the chlorine you know 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.250
 eczema it's not your fault 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.229
 ok that does not mean that you're hurting 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.649
 take care of your skin or that you have done a 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.629
 foolishness 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.340
 it just means that your skin 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:15.230
 is more fragile but clever and 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.910
 by the way the temperature is yes I 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.299
 see this and she will always be there to 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.069
 you 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.269
 do you want me to come back to explain 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.830
 how to treat your little pimples 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:27.640
 red to avoid scratching yes 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.640
