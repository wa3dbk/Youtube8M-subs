00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 the news that the bluetooth toothbrush 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.990
 could have his strange side a 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.460
 many users especially we have read i 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.320
 your comments regarding the news 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.509
 which a few weeks ago and we have 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.210
 searched now for al mobile world congress 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.460
 14 to understand if indeed the 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.570
 Bluetooth on the toothbrush makes sense can 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.470
 be just a gimmick 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.590
 Advertisement 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.680
 we were pleasantly surprised both 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.449
 for the space itself is for the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.289
 technology and the quality of 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.750
 applications for iphone and android 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.850
 first of all the toothbrush is an hour 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.760
 all b with bluetooth 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.800
 now I don't know very well but 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.040
 however it seems to me like a toothbrush 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.860
 rather normal is interesting how 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.190
 oral b has tried to work together 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:52.309
 dentists to create a real e 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.680
 their application in companion for those who 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.899
 go to the dentist and have trouble paying attention to 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.379
 teeth to the president in the settings 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.540
 for example it is possible to go to 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.369
 select some areas of the mouth that 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.409
 generally they are washed and less there 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.409
 there are about three four areas that second 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.240
 Studies we trust do not come 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.060
 properly brush the 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.570
 dentist can tell you the areas with gods 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.020
 more and in this way in the save will be 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.210
 possible to pursue objectives at 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.600
 order to wash those too 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.500
 areas 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.049
 pressing start automatically we have 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.450
 the denial of the toothbrush and the 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.270
 time indications considered that 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.890
 two minutes only the average time 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.159
 recommended to brush your teeth but that 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.310
 haste the application shows a 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.820
 very neat graphics and nice 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.930
 interesting that the toothbrush 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.840
 councilor, so if I do too much 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.100
 pressure on the teeth you see how it is 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.010
 lights the toothbrush in red and 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.640
 the same application of red lady 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:00.310
 because it is counterproductive to go and do 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.229
 too much pressure transferor 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.670
 there are also six different profiles 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.899
 senses krill and other massages that 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.489
 can be selected directly 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.450
 from the toothbrush and that in return 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.110
 obviously also inside 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:17.170
 application but not only 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:20.349
 the application allows you to have your own 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.989
 a display of statistics ad 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.950
 example in February what we have 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.050
 brush the teeth 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.069
 if the goal reached by two minutes 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.860
 visualization was pursued 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.440
 weekly or monthly also going to 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.000
 put your smartphone horizontally 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.280
 we have the possibility to see a 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.709
 graph always relative to the division 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.940
 daily weekly with monthly 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.500
 of our activities in space 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.900
 curious also the possibility of 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.450
 unlock real bonuses 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.569
 levels as if it were a game in which 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.939
 We can 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:01.139
 have awards for example if 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:02.239
 there is action to become the place for 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:05.030
 example the airport 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:09.480
 let's go back or if we go 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:12.120
 doing seven times and times and close to 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.430
 meal here at the port collar that we have 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.370
 showed up before the demo and then 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:21.569
 not a system to make fun 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.900
 also a daily how to wash i 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.109
 teeth 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.419
 then there are links for some 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:30.299
 Information on our doctor about 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:36.569
 medical services but they are also present 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:40.000
 options for sls reading 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:42.890
 sorry news feed 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.560
 weather for example we can go 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:50.209
 at the bottom of the screen 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:52.549
 if I can click the lower part of 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.610
 be so here it is and we have gods 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:59.299
 suggestions the weather or even the news 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.730
 of a feed reader that allow us to be 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.950
 said pay the morning to read without 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.860
 most important and have information on 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.209
 code tries another day now at 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.390
 small bluetooth space will be 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.349
 available from june in germany 219 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.100
 EUR 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.880
 the idea itself is particular but 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.650
 implementation and function 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.610
 the application is very interesting 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.260
 therefore they are not just products 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.020
 commercial but are actually 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.129
 effective and useful products for ours 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.279
 daily life 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:31.279
 such as
