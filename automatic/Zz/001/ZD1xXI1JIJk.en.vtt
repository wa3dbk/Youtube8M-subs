00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
like a stand-up and so I found you know

like a stand-up and so I found you know
I<00:00:58.590> was<00:00:58.739> kind<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.949> wondering<00:00:59.070> like<00:00:59.280> when<00:00:59.760> would

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
I was kind of wondering like when would

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.720 
I was kind of wondering like when would
my<00:01:00.329> stand-up<00:01:00.719> roots<00:01:00.960> really<00:01:01.320> kind<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.129> payoff

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
my stand-up roots really kind of payoff

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.520 
my stand-up roots really kind of payoff
because<00:01:03.059> I've<00:01:03.270> been<00:01:03.449> very<00:01:03.719> careful<00:01:04.199> about

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
because I've been very careful about

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.320 
because I've been very careful about
like<00:01:04.890> trying<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.220> make<00:01:05.430> sure<00:01:05.580> i'm<00:01:05.760> i'm<00:01:06.180> an

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
like trying to make sure i'm i'm an

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.510 
like trying to make sure i'm i'm an
actor<00:01:06.450> first<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.110> using<00:01:07.770> whatever<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.130> can<00:01:08.340> in

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
and using whatever I've done in life to

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.510 
and using whatever I've done in life to
really<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.380> enhance<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> acting<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.310> and

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
really to enhance the acting and and

really to enhance the acting and and
this<00:01:11.760> one<00:01:12.000> really<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.360> stand-up<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:12.900> really

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229
