00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
fun i had the opportunity of trying it

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.259 
fun i had the opportunity of trying it
out<00:00:28.859> when<00:00:29.189> i<00:00:29.220> was<00:00:29.580> looking<00:00:29.910> at<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.090> amount

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
out when i was looking at the amount

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.330 
out when i was looking at the amount
changes<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.140> know<00:00:31.230> what<00:00:31.349> i<00:00:31.529> had<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.160> lot<00:00:32.309> of

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
changes and you know what i had a lot of

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.549 
changes and you know what i had a lot of
fun<00:00:32.610> when<00:00:32.940> i<00:00:33.149> was<00:00:33.329> doing<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.960> think<00:00:34.140> it's<00:00:34.469> a

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
fun when i was doing it I think it's a

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.440 
fun when i was doing it I think it's a
better<00:00:34.710> implementation<00:00:35.579> than<00:00:36.000> what<00:00:36.300> the

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
better implementation than what the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.139 
better implementation than what the
current<00:00:36.660> metal<00:00:37.410> riff<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.860> right<00:00:38.100> now<00:00:38.280> it's

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
current metal riff is right now it's

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.910 
current metal riff is right now it's
more<00:00:39.360> rewarding<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.350> takes<00:00:40.590> less<00:00:40.770> time

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
more rewarding and it takes less time

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.850 
more rewarding and it takes less time
and<00:00:41.370> overall<00:00:42.030> it's<00:00:42.210> actually<00:00:42.510> more<00:00:42.629> fun<00:00:42.930> than

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
and overall it's actually more fun than

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.350 
and overall it's actually more fun than
the<00:00:44.010> normal<00:00:44.309> riff<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.670> also<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.059> comes<00:00:45.210> with

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
the normal riff and also it comes with

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.630 
the normal riff and also it comes with
scoreboard<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.530> keeps<00:00:46.649> track<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.190> how<00:00:47.430> well

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640

loop that's it and I think that's that

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.560 
loop that's it and I think that's that
set<00:01:55.619> such<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:55.979> much<00:01:56.340> much<00:01:56.549> better<00:01:56.909> better<00:01:57.270> thing

to a higher riff level you actually have

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.840 
to a higher riff level you actually have
to<00:02:15.569> finish<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:16.140> rift<00:02:16.530> before<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.520> timer<00:02:17.760> runs

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.820 
to finish the rift before the timer runs
out<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.420> faster<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.200> finish<00:02:19.230> the

out and the faster you finish the

current<00:02:20.310> rift<00:02:20.520> that<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.730> have<00:02:20.910> now<00:02:21.150> the

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
current rift that you have now the

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.150 
current rift that you have now the

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
higher the level key that you will

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.210 
higher the level key that you will
receive<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:23.970> let's<00:02:24.180> say<00:02:24.360> if<00:02:24.600> I<00:02:24.750> was<00:02:24.930> on<00:02:25.220> ref

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
receive so let's say if I was on ref

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.680 
receive so let's say if I was on ref
level<00:02:26.520> one<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:26.910> finish<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.300> within<00:02:27.450> five

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
level one and I finish it within five

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.750 
level one and I finish it within five
minutes<00:02:27.900> I'll<00:02:28.140> probably<00:02:28.440> received<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.190> rift

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
minutes I'll probably received a rift

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.080 
minutes I'll probably received a rift
level<00:02:30.060> key<00:02:30.590> 15<00:02:31.590> but<00:02:32.250> if<00:02:32.489> I<00:02:32.670> would<00:02:32.970> have

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
level key 15 but if I would have

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.390 
level key 15 but if I would have
finished<00:02:33.209> a<00:02:33.569> one<00:02:34.110> minute<00:02:34.319> before<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:35.069> ends

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
finished a one minute before it ends

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.710 
finished a one minute before it ends
i'll<00:02:35.520> probably<00:02:35.670> just<00:02:35.910> receive<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.540> roof

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
i'll probably just receive the roof

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.590 
i'll probably just receive the roof
level<00:02:36.870> Q<00:02:37.140> 2<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:37.830> that's<00:02:38.010> how<00:02:38.100> that<00:02:38.250> works<00:02:38.730> the

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
level Q 2 so that's how that works the

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.330 
level Q 2 so that's how that works the
greater<00:02:39.959> rift<00:02:40.230> level<00:02:40.560> difficulty<00:02:41.130> is

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
greater rift level difficulty is

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.490 
greater rift level difficulty is
separated<00:02:42.000> from<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.390> normal<00:02:43.140> difficulty

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
separated from the normal difficulty

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.920 
separated from the normal difficulty
that<00:02:43.800> you<00:02:43.920> have<00:02:44.130> so<00:02:44.519> torment<00:02:45.090> 6<00:02:45.360> will<00:02:45.600> not<00:02:45.780> be

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
that you have so torment 6 will not be

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.740 
that you have so torment 6 will not be
added<00:02:46.350> on<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.830> let's<00:02:47.130> say<00:02:47.310> at<00:02:47.580> greater<00:02:48.150> rift

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
added on to let's say at greater rift

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.290 
added on to let's say at greater rift
level<00:02:49.080> 15<00:02:49.590> so<00:02:50.130> they're<00:02:50.489> they're<00:02:50.940> different

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
level 15 so they're they're different

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.940 
level 15 so they're they're different
doubling<00:02:51.690> systems<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.470> don't<00:02:52.590> have<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:52.769> worry

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
doubling systems you don't have to worry

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.650 
doubling systems you don't have to worry
about<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.190> now<00:02:53.670> no<00:02:53.970> funny<00:02:54.209> business<00:02:54.510> going

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
about that now no funny business going

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.440 
about that now no funny business going
on<00:02:54.989> nothing<00:02:55.230> harder<00:02:55.650> than<00:02:55.680> it<00:02:55.860> should<00:02:55.980> be<00:02:56.450> once

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
on nothing harder than it should be once

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.270 
on nothing harder than it should be once
you're<00:02:57.600> inside<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:58.050> rift<00:02:58.260> one<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:58.920> can't

you're inside the rift one you can't

you're inside the rift one you can't

actually change any of your skill that

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.780 
actually change any of your skill that
means<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.440> are<00:03:01.620> pretty<00:03:01.890> much<00:03:01.980> in<00:03:02.250> eternal

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
means you are pretty much in eternal

back into town and repair your armor and
I<00:03:07.560> believe<00:03:07.830> change<00:03:08.160> skill<00:03:08.430> as<00:03:08.549> well<00:03:08.900> you<00:03:09.900> can't

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
I believe change skill as well you can't

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.560 
I believe change skill as well you can't

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
your last checkpoint is which means your

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.789 
your last checkpoint is which means your

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
last gate that you entered so that means

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.310 
last gate that you entered so that means

on a bigger map try not to die because
it's<00:03:23.100> it's<00:03:23.609> going<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:23.850> take<00:03:24.000> a<00:03:24.030> long<00:03:24.209> time<00:03:24.450> to

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
it's it's going to take a long time to

it's it's going to take a long time to

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
going to lose a lot of time on that I

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.199 
going to lose a lot of time on that I
believe<00:03:28.170> I<00:03:28.380> dived<00:03:28.680> once<00:03:29.100> on<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.430> map<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:29.910> I<00:03:29.970> lost

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
believe I dived once on a map and I lost

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.120 
believe I dived once on a map and I lost
like<00:03:30.390> two<00:03:30.600> minutes<00:03:30.840> two<00:03:31.560> minutes<00:03:31.590> worth<00:03:32.010> of

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
like two minutes two minutes worth of

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.699 
like two minutes two minutes worth of
thing<00:03:32.280> also<00:03:33.180> you<00:03:33.239> can't<00:03:33.600> teleport<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:34.470> another

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
thing also you can't teleport to another

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.800 
thing also you can't teleport to another
player<00:03:35.130> when<00:03:35.459> they're<00:03:35.640> inside<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.180> rip<00:03:36.390> so

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
player when they're inside the rip so

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.120 
player when they're inside the rip so
you<00:03:36.900> actually<00:03:37.019> have<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.350> catch<00:03:37.560> up<00:03:37.739> with<00:03:37.950> them

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
you actually have to catch up with them

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.979 
you actually have to catch up with them
and<00:03:38.310> you<00:03:38.430> also<00:03:38.549> i<00:03:38.970> believe<00:03:39.180> need<00:03:39.450> your<00:03:39.600> own<00:03:39.720> key

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
and you also i believe need your own key

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.560 
and you also i believe need your own key
to<00:03:40.350> get<00:03:40.859> into<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.430> greater<00:03:41.609> rift<00:03:41.850> I'm<00:03:42.390> not

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
to get into the greater rift I'm not

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.199 
to get into the greater rift I'm not
sure<00:03:42.630> can<00:03:42.959> I<00:03:43.049> go<00:03:43.200> I<00:03:43.350> would<00:03:43.440> sing<00:03:43.739> solo<00:03:44.070> but<00:03:44.850> you

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
sure can I go I would sing solo but you

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.880 
sure can I go I would sing solo but you
can't<00:03:45.450> teleport<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:46.049> a<00:03:46.079> player<00:03:46.350> you<00:03:46.560> can't<00:03:46.769> use

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
can't teleport to a player you can't use

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.860 
can't teleport to a player you can't use
the<00:03:47.040> portrait<00:03:47.549> or<00:03:47.730> even<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.060> banner<00:03:48.269> so<00:03:48.780> you

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
the portrait or even the banner so you

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.990 
the portrait or even the banner so you
actually<00:03:49.019> have<00:03:49.320> to<00:03:49.470> run<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.890> them<00:03:50.250> which<00:03:50.700> kind

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
actually have to run to them which kind

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.479 
actually have to run to them which kind
of<00:03:51.120> it<00:03:51.390> if<00:03:51.840> he<00:03:51.900> and<00:03:52.170> sucky<00:03:52.470> but<00:03:52.680> that's<00:03:53.280> how

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
of it if he and sucky but that's how

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.720 
of it if he and sucky but that's how
it's<00:03:53.850> designed<00:03:54.769> now<00:03:55.769> for<00:03:55.980> my<00:03:56.070> own<00:03:56.220> experience

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
it's designed now for my own experience

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.270 
it's designed now for my own experience
there<00:03:56.940> are<00:03:57.150> some<00:03:57.660> packs<00:03:58.350> that<00:03:58.530> are<00:03:58.650> not<00:03:58.980> worth

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
there are some packs that are not worth

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.300 
there are some packs that are not worth
killing<00:03:59.840> one<00:04:00.840> of<00:04:00.870> those<00:04:01.049> packs<00:04:01.350> are<00:04:01.620> shielding

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
killing one of those packs are shielding

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.330 
killing one of those packs are shielding
and<00:04:02.459> plus<00:04:02.940> help<00:04:03.329> together<00:04:03.920> they<00:04:04.920> take<00:04:05.130> a<00:04:05.160> long

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
and plus help together they take a long

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.230 
and plus help together they take a long
time<00:04:05.640> to<00:04:05.700> kill<00:04:06.180> if<00:04:06.450> you<00:04:06.750> can't

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
time to kill if you can't

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.080 
time to kill if you can't
that's<00:04:07.540> enough<00:04:07.870> because<00:04:08.860> shielding<00:04:09.640> negates

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
that's enough because shielding negates

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.270 
that's enough because shielding negates
your<00:04:10.270> damage<00:04:10.930> and<00:04:11.140> extra<00:04:11.680> health<00:04:11.860> is<00:04:12.010> just<00:04:12.190> an

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
your damage and extra health is just an

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.450 
your damage and extra health is just an
extra<00:04:12.640> help<00:04:12.850> so<00:04:13.390> my<00:04:13.870> suggestion<00:04:14.260> is<00:04:14.650> that<00:04:14.710> do

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460 
extra help so my suggestion is that do

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.800 
extra help so my suggestion is that do
move<00:04:15.670> on<00:04:15.820> from<00:04:16.000> those<00:04:16.180> if<00:04:16.360> you<00:04:16.450> can't<00:04:16.660> show

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
move on from those if you can't show

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.140 
move on from those if you can't show
them<00:04:16.959> fast<00:04:17.140> enough<00:04:17.260> because<00:04:17.620> I<00:04:17.980> wasted<00:04:18.940> three

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
them fast enough because I wasted three

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.880 
them fast enough because I wasted three
minutes<00:04:19.450> trying<00:04:19.660> to<00:04:19.720> kill<00:04:19.930> a<00:04:19.959> pack<00:04:20.230> and<00:04:20.500> that

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
minutes trying to kill a pack and that

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.500 
minutes trying to kill a pack and that
was<00:04:21.040> a<00:04:21.070> three<00:04:21.310> minutes<00:04:21.610> loss<00:04:21.760> and<00:04:22.030> I<00:04:22.240> almost

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
was a three minutes loss and I almost

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.350 
was a three minutes loss and I almost
didn't<00:04:22.870> finish<00:04:23.110> that<00:04:23.530> rift<00:04:23.800> in<00:04:24.040> time<00:04:24.820> because

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
didn't finish that rift in time because

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.720 
didn't finish that rift in time because
of<00:04:25.390> that<00:04:25.780> problem<00:04:26.140> itself<00:04:26.770> so<00:04:27.370> like<00:04:27.550> I<00:04:27.670> said

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
of that problem itself so like I said

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.960 
of that problem itself so like I said
move<00:04:28.150> on<00:04:28.410> also<00:04:29.410> like<00:04:29.980> little<00:04:30.430> packs<00:04:30.640> of<00:04:30.850> like

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
move on also like little packs of like

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.640 
move on also like little packs of like
two<00:04:31.210> or<00:04:31.360> three<00:04:31.390> mobs<00:04:31.840> don't<00:04:32.200> bother<00:04:32.350> killing

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
two or three mobs don't bother killing

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.710 
two or three mobs don't bother killing
them<00:04:32.920> just<00:04:33.430> move<00:04:33.580> on<00:04:33.730> into<00:04:33.970> the<00:04:34.180> bigger<00:04:34.420> one

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
them just move on into the bigger one

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.660 
them just move on into the bigger one
the<00:04:35.380> more<00:04:35.830> health<00:04:36.220> or<00:04:36.490> HP<00:04:37.120> or<00:04:37.300> harder<00:04:37.870> the

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
the more health or HP or harder the

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.240 
the more health or HP or harder the
packs<00:04:39.670> or<00:04:39.970> or<00:04:40.180> mobs<00:04:40.780> are<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.410> more<00:04:41.770> progress

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
packs or or mobs are the more progress

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.630 
packs or or mobs are the more progress
you'll<00:04:42.460> get<00:04:42.760> into<00:04:42.970> your<00:04:43.210> bar<00:04:44.040> the<00:04:45.040> champion

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
you'll get into your bar the champion

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.250 
you'll get into your bar the champion

pass the meat packs and treasure goblin

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.550 
pass the meat packs and treasure goblin
won't<00:04:47.740> drop<00:04:48.100> in<00:04:48.460> little<00:04:48.910> red<00:04:49.690> crystal<00:04:50.260> globe

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
won't drop in little red crystal globe

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.230 
won't drop in little red crystal globe
thing<00:04:50.950> that<00:04:51.130> looks<00:04:51.280> like<00:04:51.340> a<00:04:51.430> health<00:04:51.670> club<00:04:51.880> pick

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
thing that looks like a health club pick

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.240 
thing that looks like a health club pick
them<00:04:52.420> up<00:04:52.510> because<00:04:52.690> those<00:04:53.110> things<00:04:53.440> do<00:04:53.710> add<00:04:53.920> on

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
them up because those things do add on

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.490 
them up because those things do add on
to<00:04:54.610> your<00:04:54.640> progress<00:04:55.210> bar<00:04:55.660> and<00:04:55.840> it'll<00:04:55.990> make<00:04:56.170> it<00:04:56.320> a

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
to your progress bar and it'll make it a

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.500 
to your progress bar and it'll make it a
little<00:04:56.920> bit<00:04:57.070> more<00:04:57.190> faster<00:04:57.700> to<00:04:57.880> finish<00:04:58.150> the<00:04:58.300> rib

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
little bit more faster to finish the rib

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.890 
little bit more faster to finish the rib
so<00:04:59.320> I<00:04:59.350> believe<00:04:59.590> that's<00:04:59.800> all<00:05:00.070> there<00:05:00.250> is<00:05:00.370> to<00:05:00.900> the

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
so I believe that's all there is to the

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.080 
so I believe that's all there is to the
great<00:05:02.050> riff<00:05:02.320> and<00:05:02.470> it's<00:05:03.340> actually<00:05:03.460> really<00:05:03.700> fun

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
great riff and it's actually really fun

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.960 
great riff and it's actually really fun
I<00:05:04.360> played<00:05:05.260> it<00:05:05.380> for<00:05:05.410> an<00:05:05.650> hour<00:05:05.800> over<00:05:06.400> the<00:05:06.430> weekend

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
I played it for an hour over the weekend

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.440 
I played it for an hour over the weekend
and<00:05:07.210> I<00:05:07.240> mean<00:05:07.960> I<00:05:08.170> said<00:05:09.070> I<00:05:09.280> got<00:05:09.490> three<00:05:09.970> Paragon

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
and I mean I said I got three Paragon

two or three legendaries so it's pretty
