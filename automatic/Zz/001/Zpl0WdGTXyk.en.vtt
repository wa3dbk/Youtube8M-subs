00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
looks like it does some things that that

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.030 
looks like it does some things that that
other<00:02:00.030> cameras<00:02:00.509> do<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:01.320> know<00:02:01.439> video<00:02:01.710> effects

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
other cameras do you know video effects

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.770 
other cameras do you know video effects
and<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.250> sort<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.579> thing<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:02.790> looks<00:02:03.689> like

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
and that sort of thing so looks like

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.940 
and that sort of thing so looks like
they<00:02:03.930> put<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.140> lot<00:02:04.259> into<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.680> three-year

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
they put a lot into it a three-year

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.260 
they put a lot into it a three-year
hardware<00:02:05.579> warranty<00:02:05.820> which<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.299> nice<00:02:06.509> USB<00:02:07.200> and

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
hardware warranty which is nice USB and

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.470 
hardware warranty which is nice USB and
a<00:02:08.330> 1.3<00:02:09.170> megapixel<00:02:09.820> so<00:02:10.820> let's<00:02:11.030> go<00:02:11.150> ahead<00:02:11.270> and

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
a 1.3 megapixel so let's go ahead and

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.510 
a 1.3 megapixel so let's go ahead and
open<00:02:11.750> this<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.740> like<00:02:12.980> I<00:02:13.010> said<00:02:13.130> I'm<00:02:13.370> going<00:02:13.460> to

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
open this and like I said I'm going to

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.970 
open this and like I said I'm going to
have<00:02:13.670> to<00:02:13.790> do<00:02:13.910> a<00:02:13.940> review<00:02:14.360> on<00:02:14.420> it<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:15.320> use<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.800> for

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
have to do a review on it and use it for

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.120 
have to do a review on it and use it for
some<00:02:16.130> time<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.610> see<00:02:16.760> how<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:17.030> compares<00:02:18.010> like<00:02:19.010> I

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
some time and see how it compares like I

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.250 
some time and see how it compares like I
said<00:02:19.340> I<00:02:19.370> already<00:02:19.670> made<00:02:20.150> some<00:02:20.180> slits<00:02:20.780> here<00:02:21.020> in

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
said I already made some slits here in

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.710 
said I already made some slits here in
the<00:02:21.710> looks<00:02:22.580> like<00:02:22.700> I<00:02:22.760> didn't<00:02:23.030> get<00:02:23.120> them<00:02:23.300> all<00:02:23.390> but

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
the looks like I didn't get them all but

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.820 
the looks like I didn't get them all but
that's<00:02:24.230> okay

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
that's okay

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.470 
that's okay
I'll<00:02:25.670> go<00:02:25.820> ahead<00:02:25.910> and<00:02:26.120> open<00:02:26.210> it<00:02:27.100> take<00:02:28.100> a<00:02:28.130> look

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
and here you have the camera looks kind

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.510 
and here you have the camera looks kind

of like the same camera you get with an

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.020 
of like the same camera you get with an
Xbox<00:02:37.790> which<00:02:38.630> I<00:02:38.780> do<00:02:38.840> have<00:02:39.520> I'll<00:02:40.520> test<00:02:40.790> that<00:02:41.000> out

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
looks like let's go ahead and pull the

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.020 
looks like let's go ahead and pull the
camera<00:03:27.080> out<00:03:27.380> of<00:03:27.560> here

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.149

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 
like they're packaging the outside and

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.039 
like they're packaging the outside and
unfortunately<00:03:35.670> to<00:03:35.849> get<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.209> nice<00:03:36.389> packaging

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
unfortunately to get the nice packaging

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:42.259 
unfortunately to get the nice packaging
you<00:03:37.859> have<00:03:38.129> to<00:03:38.749> have<00:03:39.749> some<00:03:40.549> creative<00:03:41.549> cardboard

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
you have to have some creative cardboard

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.619 
you have to have some creative cardboard
setup<00:03:43.109> to<00:03:43.409> keep<00:03:44.219> it<00:03:44.340> in<00:03:44.459> there<00:03:44.609> so<00:03:45.269> let's<00:03:45.450> go

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
setup to keep it in there so let's go

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.550 
setup to keep it in there so let's go
ahead<00:03:45.749> and<00:03:46.019> hop<00:03:46.409> they're<00:03:46.680> probably<00:03:48.500> okay<00:03:49.500> so

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
that's kind of nice very lightweight and

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.250 
that's kind of nice very lightweight and
I<00:03:53.879> wouldn't<00:03:54.060> expect<00:03:54.269> it<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.629> be<00:03:54.719> very<00:03:54.750> heavy

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
I wouldn't expect it to be very heavy

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.940 
I wouldn't expect it to be very heavy
but<00:03:56.040> it's<00:03:56.639> more<00:03:57.150> lightweight<00:03:57.530> they<00:03:58.530> do<00:03:58.590> show

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
but it's more lightweight they do show

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.559 
but it's more lightweight they do show
that<00:03:58.980> they<00:03:59.250> have<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.400> call<00:03:59.700> button<00:03:59.939> on<00:04:00.120> here<00:04:00.419> I

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
that they have a call button on here I

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:01.940 
that they have a call button on here I
haven't<00:04:00.870> used<00:04:01.049> that<00:04:01.169> I<00:04:01.290> don't<00:04:01.530> know<00:04:01.650> how<00:04:01.769> that

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
haven't used that I don't know how that

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 
looks like this unfolds yeah there it

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:17.629 
looks like this unfolds yeah there it
goes<00:04:12.889> so<00:04:15.680> it'll<00:04:16.680> hook<00:04:16.829> on<00:04:17.009> to<00:04:17.160> your<00:04:17.250> monitor

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
goes so it'll hook on to your monitor

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.409 
goes so it'll hook on to your monitor

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
that's what it looks like pretty easily

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.390 
that's what it looks like pretty easily
believed<00:04:21.419> and<00:04:22.349> I've<00:04:22.410> heard<00:04:22.710> some<00:04:22.889> people<00:04:23.070> talk

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
believed and I've heard some people talk

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.790 
believed and I've heard some people talk
about<00:04:23.580> their<00:04:23.880> cameras<00:04:24.360> I<00:04:24.539> believe<00:04:24.900> that<00:04:25.620> it

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
about their cameras I believe that it

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.469 
about their cameras I believe that it
has<00:04:25.830> a<00:04:26.070> magnet<00:04:26.669> in<00:04:26.789> it<00:04:26.880> I'm<00:04:27.030> not<00:04:27.060> a<00:04:27.240> hundred

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
has a magnet in it I'm not a hundred

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.120 
has a magnet in it I'm not a hundred
percent<00:04:27.960> that<00:04:28.020> you<00:04:28.349> know<00:04:28.440> that<00:04:28.590> it'll<00:04:28.770> clip<00:04:28.979> on

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
percent that you know that it'll clip on

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.400 
percent that you know that it'll clip on
I'll<00:04:29.880> definitely<00:04:30.539> check<00:04:30.570> that<00:04:30.810> out<00:04:30.990> like<00:04:31.289> I

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
I'll definitely check that out like I

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.920 
I'll definitely check that out like I
said<00:04:31.590> I<00:04:31.620> need<00:04:31.830> to<00:04:31.860> use<00:04:32.160> this<00:04:32.370> I<00:04:33.090> have<00:04:33.599> to<00:04:33.720> use<00:04:33.840> it

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
said I need to use this I have to use it

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.450 
said I need to use this I have to use it
on<00:04:34.020> my<00:04:34.139> Windows<00:04:34.470> computer<00:04:34.949> or<00:04:35.160> you<00:04:35.310> could

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
on my Windows computer or you could

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.909 
on my Windows computer or you could
probably<00:04:35.960> figure<00:04:36.960> out<00:04:37.139> a<00:04:37.199> way<00:04:37.320> to<00:04:37.349> use<00:04:37.470> it<00:04:37.740> with

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
probably figure out a way to use it with

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.110 
probably figure out a way to use it with
with<00:04:38.400> a<00:04:38.430> Mac<00:04:38.699> if<00:04:38.940> you<00:04:39.449> don't<00:04:39.720> have<00:04:41.000> if<00:04:42.000> you

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
with a Mac if you don't have if you

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
majority of Mac users do we do a little

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.870 
majority of Mac users do we do a little
bit<00:04:48.270> of<00:04:48.330> that<00:04:48.419> on<00:04:48.599> our<00:04:48.630> site<00:04:48.960> however<00:04:49.759> like<00:04:50.759> I

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
bit of that on our site however like I

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.180 
bit of that on our site however like I
said<00:04:50.909> the<00:04:51.120> majority<00:04:51.389> of<00:04:51.599> you<00:04:51.690> use<00:04:52.190> Microsoft

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
said the majority of you use Microsoft

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.909 
said the majority of you use Microsoft
products<00:04:53.909> so<00:04:54.000> Microsoft<00:04:54.360> on<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:54.780> front<00:04:55.050> 1.3

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
products so Microsoft on the front 1.3

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.100 
products so Microsoft on the front 1.3
megapixel<00:04:56.039> camera<00:04:56.759> no<00:04:56.909> lens<00:04:57.150> over<00:04:57.509> here<00:04:57.690> you

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
megapixel camera no lens over here you

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.290 
megapixel camera no lens over here you
can<00:04:58.259> feel<00:04:58.470> this<00:04:58.620> plastic<00:04:59.159> you<00:04:59.940> do<00:05:00.120> have<00:05:00.270> a

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
can feel this plastic you do have a

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.409 
can feel this plastic you do have a
microphone<00:05:00.690> also<00:05:01.050> so<00:05:01.830> even<00:05:02.639> if<00:05:02.759> you<00:05:02.880> you<00:05:03.330> know

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
microphone also so even if you you know

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.300 
microphone also so even if you you know
you<00:05:03.479> don't<00:05:03.659> need<00:05:03.780> a<00:05:03.840> camera<00:05:04.110> all<00:05:04.289> the<00:05:04.349> time<00:05:04.440> you

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
you don't need a camera all the time you

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.350 
you don't need a camera all the time you
probably<00:05:05.370> could<00:05:05.789> use<00:05:05.820> it<00:05:06.060> as<00:05:06.180> a<00:05:06.210> microphone

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
probably could use it as a microphone

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.740 
probably could use it as a microphone
input<00:05:06.840> via<00:05:07.169> USB<00:05:07.580> which<00:05:08.580> I<00:05:08.729> know<00:05:08.789> I<00:05:08.909> will<00:05:09.360> do<00:05:09.539> is

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
input via USB which I know I will do is

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.499 
input via USB which I know I will do is
I<00:05:10.199> play<00:05:10.699> play<00:05:11.699> some<00:05:11.880> older<00:05:12.120> games<00:05:12.330> like

where<00:05:18.419> you<00:05:18.509> use<00:05:18.690> it<00:05:18.870> so<00:05:19.050> it's<00:05:20.039> telling<00:05:20.190> you<00:05:20.370> to

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
where you use it so it's telling you to

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.040 
where you use it so it's telling you to
install<00:05:20.789> first<00:05:21.120> so<00:05:21.300> they<00:05:21.419> put<00:05:21.570> this<00:05:21.719> cover

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
install first so they put this cover

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.040 
install first so they put this cover
over<00:05:22.199> the<00:05:22.500> USB<00:05:22.740> so<00:05:23.490> I<00:05:23.520> will<00:05:23.789> do<00:05:23.940> that

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
see how clear it is 1.3 megapixel is

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.540 
see how clear it is 1.3 megapixel is
pretty<00:06:15.640> good<00:06:15.790> for<00:06:15.850> a<00:06:16.120> webcam<00:06:16.510> I<00:06:16.540> think<00:06:16.900> so<00:06:17.590> you

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
pretty good for a webcam I think so you

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.580 
pretty good for a webcam I think so you
know<00:06:18.670> it<00:06:19.150> should<00:06:19.360> be<00:06:19.480> pretty<00:06:19.660> clear<00:06:19.900> set<00:06:20.320> off

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590 
know it should be pretty clear set off

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.240 
know it should be pretty clear set off
it<00:06:20.860> auto<00:06:21.010> adjust<00:06:21.490> in<00:06:21.670> light<00:06:22.410> and<00:06:23.410> we'll<00:06:24.040> check

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250 
it auto adjust in light and we'll check

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.400 
it auto adjust in light and we'll check
out<00:06:24.370> the<00:06:24.520> software<00:06:24.940> and<00:06:25.270> see<00:06:25.840> if<00:06:25.930> we<00:06:26.050> can<00:06:26.200> show

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:26.410 
out the software and see if we can show

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.620 
out the software and see if we can show
you<00:06:26.470> what<00:06:26.710> that<00:06:26.740> looks<00:06:27.130> like<00:06:27.300> it<00:06:28.300> might<00:06:28.360> be<00:06:28.600> a

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
you what that looks like it might be a

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.030 
you what that looks like it might be a
little<00:06:28.810> bit<00:06:28.900> tricky<00:06:29.230> to<00:06:29.320> show<00:06:29.500> you<00:06:29.560> that<00:06:29.830> but

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.040 
little bit tricky to show you that but

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.220 
little bit tricky to show you that but
I'll<00:06:30.520> see<00:06:30.760> what<00:06:30.880> I<00:06:30.910> can<00:06:30.970> do<00:06:31.270> and<00:06:31.510> get<00:06:31.960> that<00:06:32.080> in

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:32.230 
I'll see what I can do and get that in

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.160 
I'll see what I can do and get that in
the<00:06:32.350> video<00:06:32.620> and<00:06:33.480> definitely<00:06:34.480> check<00:06:34.600> these<00:06:34.990> out

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:35.170 
the video and definitely check these out

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.170 
the video and definitely check these out
if<00:06:35.380> you've<00:06:35.500> been<00:06:35.650> looking<00:06:35.980> for<00:06:36.010> a<00:06:36.220> webcam<00:06:36.610> I'm

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180 
if you've been looking for a webcam I'm

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.720 
if you've been looking for a webcam I'm

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:39.730 
assuming everything Microsoft hardware

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.290 
assuming everything Microsoft hardware
wise<00:06:40.140> I'm<00:06:41.160> really<00:06:42.160> like<00:06:42.370> I<00:06:42.550> like<00:06:42.580> the<00:06:42.880> mice<00:06:43.060> I

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
wise I'm really like I like the mice I

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.780 
wise I'm really like I like the mice I
like<00:06:43.480> keyboards<00:06:43.830> I'm<00:06:44.830> assuming<00:06:45.310> this<00:06:45.430> is<00:06:45.610> good

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:45.790 
like keyboards I'm assuming this is good

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.180 
like keyboards I'm assuming this is good
I<00:06:45.820> like<00:06:46.120> the<00:06:46.270> camera<00:06:46.660> that<00:06:46.810> comes<00:06:46.930> with<00:06:47.260> the<00:06:47.380> or

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:48.190 
I like the camera that comes with the or

I like the camera that comes with the or
not<00:06:48.340> doesn't<00:06:48.610> come<00:06:48.820> with<00:06:49.000> but<00:06:49.180> you<00:06:49.300> can<00:06:49.480> buy

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:49.630 
not doesn't come with but you can buy

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.960 
not doesn't come with but you can buy
for<00:06:49.870> the<00:06:49.960> Xbox<00:06:50.350> I<00:06:50.500> do<00:06:50.560> have<00:06:50.890> that<00:06:51.130> so<00:06:51.610> I<00:06:51.640> do<00:06:51.730> have

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:51.970 
for the Xbox I do have that so I do have

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.880 
for the Xbox I do have that so I do have
some<00:06:52.180> reference<00:06:52.600> point<00:06:52.840> I<00:06:53.020> think<00:06:53.140> that's<00:06:53.560> a

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:53.890 
some reference point I think that's a

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.540 
some reference point I think that's a
pretty<00:06:54.490> decent<00:06:54.850> camera<00:06:55.770> and<00:06:56.770> I<00:06:56.860> do<00:06:56.920> use<00:06:57.220> it<00:06:57.400> and

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550 
pretty decent camera and I do use it and

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.070 
pretty decent camera and I do use it and
maybe<00:06:57.850> this<00:06:58.030> will<00:06:58.150> be<00:06:58.270> compatible<00:06:58.810> I<00:06:58.900> don't

00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080 
maybe this will be compatible I don't

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.900 
maybe this will be compatible I don't
know<00:06:59.170> but<00:06:59.530> we'll<00:06:59.770> we'll<00:07:00.220> compare<00:07:00.520> it<00:07:00.580> it<00:07:00.760> is

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:00.910 
know but we'll we'll compare it it is

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.860 
know but we'll we'll compare it it is
very<00:07:00.970> comparable<00:07:01.540> size<00:07:01.960> wise<00:07:02.260> to<00:07:02.620> the<00:07:02.830> Xbox

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:03.870 
very comparable size wise to the Xbox
