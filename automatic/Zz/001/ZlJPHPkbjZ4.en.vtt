00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
remember that we were unable to make any

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.720 
remember that we were unable to make any
upgrades<00:00:37.559> because<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.860> think<00:00:37.980> we<00:00:38.160> drew<00:00:38.309> both<00:00:38.550> of

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
upgrades because I think we drew both of

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.950 
upgrades because I think we drew both of
our<00:00:38.879> games<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.540> was<00:00:39.629> slightly

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
our games and that was slightly

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.569 
our games and that was slightly
disappointing<00:00:40.410> for<00:00:40.559> us<00:00:40.590> but<00:00:40.860> at<00:00:41.010> least<00:00:41.040> we<00:00:41.430> got

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
disappointing for us but at least we got

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.280 
disappointing for us but at least we got
to<00:00:41.730> keep<00:00:41.879> daily<00:00:42.239> sync<00:00:42.450> Raven<00:00:42.780> for<00:00:42.960> one<00:00:43.110> more

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
than four tackles completely solid but

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.560 
than four tackles completely solid but
this<00:05:25.740> whole<00:05:26.070> side<00:05:26.400> did<00:05:26.850> brilliantly<00:05:27.240> we<00:05:27.390> just

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
this whole side did brilliantly we just

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.610 
this whole side did brilliantly we just
defeated<00:05:27.810> the<00:05:27.930> legend<00:05:28.320> side

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620

we<00:05:28.680> didn't<00:05:28.830> even<00:05:28.919> concede<00:05:29.430> that's<00:05:30.240> good<00:05:30.720> I

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
we didn't even concede that's good I

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.090 
we didn't even concede that's good I
think<00:05:31.020> that's<00:05:31.169> worth<00:05:31.320> an<00:05:31.470> upgrade<00:05:31.740> in<00:05:31.860> itself

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.320 
think that's worth an upgrade in itself
so<00:05:32.310> yeah<00:05:32.460> we're<00:05:32.669> gonna<00:05:32.790> call<00:05:33.030> it<00:05:33.120> an<00:05:33.210> upgrade
