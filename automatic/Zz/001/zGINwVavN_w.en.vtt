for<00:00:05.609> The<00:00:05.700> Naturalist<00:00:06.049> it's<00:00:07.049> good<00:00:07.259> pair<00:00:07.470> of

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
for The Naturalist it's good pair of

for The Naturalist it's good pair of
binoculars<00:00:07.859> now<00:00:08.429> I've<00:00:08.670> always<00:00:08.910> been<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.269> huge

binoculars now I've always been a huge
fan<00:00:10.110> of<00:00:10.349> zeiss<00:00:11.070> optics<00:00:11.599> but<00:00:12.599> even<00:00:12.929> they<00:00:13.139> have

fan of zeiss optics but even they have

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.790 
fan of zeiss optics but even they have
raised<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.280> bar<00:00:14.490> with<00:00:14.549> these<00:00:15.000> new<00:00:15.210> victory

I<00:00:18.230> have<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.380> be<00:00:19.470> honest<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:19.980> past<00:00:20.279> I've

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
I have to be honest in the past I've

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.910 
I have to be honest in the past I've
tended<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.240> go<00:00:21.510> for<00:00:21.779> eight<00:00:21.960> times<00:00:22.380> or<00:00:22.619> seven

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
tended to go for eight times or seven

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.980 
tended to go for eight times or seven
times<00:00:23.130> magnification<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.210> that's<00:00:24.660> because

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
times magnification and that's because

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.960 
times magnification and that's because
the<00:00:25.260> higher<00:00:25.740> magnifications<00:00:26.550> tend<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.849> be

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
the higher magnifications tend to be

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.120 
the higher magnifications tend to be
heavier<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.390> therefore<00:00:27.689> harder<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.500> hold<00:00:28.769> for

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
heavier and therefore harder to hold for

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.560 
heavier and therefore harder to hold for
prolonged<00:00:29.340> periods<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.029> field<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.420> get<00:00:30.510> a

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
prolonged periods in the field you get a

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.690 
prolonged periods in the field you get a
wobbly<00:00:31.050> image<00:00:31.470> but<00:00:32.279> what<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.550> notice

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
wobbly image but what you notice

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.819 
wobbly image but what you notice
straightaway<00:00:33.270> about<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.930> SS<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.590> that

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
straightaway about the SS is that

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.340 
straightaway about the SS is that
they're<00:00:35.010> remarkably<00:00:35.850> light<00:00:36.350> incredibly

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
they're remarkably light incredibly

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.069 
they're remarkably light incredibly
light<00:00:37.530> in<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.890> hand<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.489> even<00:00:39.090> more<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.540> when

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
light in the hand and even more so when

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.920 
light in the hand and even more so when
you<00:00:40.230> bring<00:00:40.440> them<00:00:40.590> up<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.770> your<00:00:40.920> eye<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.930> yes

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
you bring them up to your eye and yes

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.420 
you bring them up to your eye and yes
Wow<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.219> image<00:00:44.520> sings<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.300> absolutely<00:00:46.430> sings

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
Wow the image sings it absolutely sings

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.049 
Wow the image sings it absolutely sings
with<00:00:47.820> detail<00:00:48.350> but<00:00:49.350> most<00:00:49.829> importantly<00:00:50.399> when

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
with detail but most importantly when

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.029 
with detail but most importantly when
it's<00:00:51.180> up<00:00:51.329> against<00:00:51.750> your<00:00:51.870> eyes<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.410> binocular

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
it's up against your eyes the binocular

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.279 
it's up against your eyes the binocular
feels<00:00:53.610> even<00:00:53.910> lighter<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.510> that's<00:00:54.930> because

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
feels even lighter and that's because

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.950 
feels even lighter and that's because
Zeiss<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.430> designed<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.239> mechanics<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.840> be

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
Zeiss have designed the mechanics to be

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.869 
Zeiss have designed the mechanics to be
in<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> back<00:00:58.469> end<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.219> binocular<00:00:59.609> closer

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
in the back end of the binocular closer

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.080 
in the back end of the binocular closer
to<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.359> bit<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:01.469> near<00:01:01.800> your<00:01:01.949> eye<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.850> as

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
to the bit that is near your eye so as

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.929 
to the bit that is near your eye so as
it<00:01:03.390> rests<00:01:03.600> against<00:01:04.110> your<00:01:04.260> eye<00:01:04.290> socket<00:01:04.939> almost

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
it rests against your eye socket almost

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.490 
it rests against your eye socket almost
all<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.479> weight<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.689> what<00:01:07.080> little<00:01:07.260> there

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
all of the weight and what little there

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.219 
all of the weight and what little there
is<00:01:07.530> sit<00:01:08.400> here<00:01:08.820> instead<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.659> your<00:01:09.689> hands<00:01:10.110> so

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
is sit here instead of in your hands so

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.280 
is sit here instead of in your hands so
they're<00:01:10.350> just<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:10.830> comfortable<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.610> hold

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
they're just so comfortable to hold

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.429 
they're just so comfortable to hold
next<00:01:13.290> thing<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.500> notice<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.549> focus

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
next thing you notice is the focus

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.800 
next thing you notice is the focus
because<00:01:16.439> I'm<00:01:16.619> now<00:01:17.250> focused<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.210> couple<00:01:18.570> of

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
because I'm now focused on a couple of

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
focus on the reeds in front of me I only

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.100 
focus on the reeds in front of me I only
have<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.430> make<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.729> smallest<00:01:27.299> movement<00:01:27.990> on

the focus wheel and snap so I go from a

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.130 
the focus wheel and snap so I go from a
distant<00:01:32.250> object<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.210> relatively<00:01:33.810> close

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
I can focus incredibly close I can get

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.990 
I can focus incredibly close I can get
good<00:01:49.020> views<00:01:49.560> without<00:01:49.979> moving<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.640> without
