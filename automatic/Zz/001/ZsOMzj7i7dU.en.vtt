00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.330 
and last time I use this this is
actually<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:28.170> hard<00:02:28.440> drive<00:02:28.620> that<00:02:28.799> came<00:02:29.010> with

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
actually the hard drive that came with

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.380 
actually the hard drive that came with
it<00:02:30.680> so<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:31.709> actually<00:02:31.830> upgraded<00:02:32.519> our<00:02:32.730> hard<00:02:33.150> drive

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
it so I actually upgraded our hard drive

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.590 
it so I actually upgraded our hard drive
to<00:02:33.510> make<00:02:33.630> it<00:02:33.780> faster<00:02:34.170> but<00:02:34.769> this<00:02:35.130> actually<00:02:35.850> will

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
to make it faster but this actually will

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.449 
to make it faster but this actually will
run<00:02:36.900> faster<00:02:37.170> than<00:02:37.440> probably<00:02:37.860> most<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.250> your

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
run faster than probably most of your

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.330 
run faster than probably most of your
compare<00:02:38.940> pcs<00:02:39.780> if<00:02:39.989> you<00:02:40.110> got<00:02:40.260> any<00:02:40.500> because<00:02:41.190> I

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
compare pcs if you got any because I

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.180 
compare pcs if you got any because I
tweaked<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:42.030> completely<00:02:43.019> and<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:45.480> say<00:02:46.080> it<00:02:46.350> was<00:02:47.160> a

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
tweaked it completely and I say it was a

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.880 
tweaked it completely and I say it was a
little<00:02:47.700> sluggish<00:02:48.090> but<00:02:48.690> apart<00:02:49.320> from<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:49.530> it

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
little sluggish but apart from that it

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.060 
little sluggish but apart from that it
works<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.700> works<00:02:50.730> pretty<00:02:51.120> well<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:52.739> i've<00:02:52.859> just

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
works it works pretty well and i've just

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.720 
works it works pretty well and i've just
installed<00:02:53.220> google<00:02:53.700> chrome<00:02:54.359> and<00:02:55.310> CC<00:02:56.310> cleaner

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730
