00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.650
 222 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:18.630
 People say that one- third of their lives are spent sleeping 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:22.890
 Adequate sleep time for adults is 7 hours a day 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.720
 At this time, the slider supporting our body is responsible for the sleeping health 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.630
 Ingeo important Yozoh 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.630
 Introduce the best way to life health 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:44.629
 Since 1992, more than 21 years heat pipe and flat 100 loess warm bed 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:49.760
 Bakmyeongsuk representative on earnestly study 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:51.079
 Both refrain from selecting a product until its own technical research and development and domestic and international 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.579
 Obtained patent 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:59.750
 I am changing the paradigm of culture to sleep in Korea . 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:03.949
 I do not see you All these trees are all Tom 100 trees 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:09.020
 There's a company that makes healthy beds with cottonwood. 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:11.119
 Hello. Hello. I am not another tree. I chose this wood. 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:16.160
 I think there's a reason. 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:21.640
 Atopy is known to excel in the healing of rhinitis and asthma 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:24.259
 Cottonwood strengthens the body's immune system and itching, a painful symptom of skin disease . 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.649
 It greatly alleviates 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:33.890
 And a substance called terpene u is emitted. 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:38.360
 This substance stabilizes the mind and body, enhances concentration and cleanses the head. 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:42.860
 We are committed to sharing this excellent effect with many people. 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:47.990
 We make products and apply them to the interior. 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:51.740
 Lee, Jeonnam Area 1 Domestic Hanwha trees are used and the sanding finish 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:57.380
 Of course they keep them up to quality in wood 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:02:00.380
 Indeed natural handling experience paddy moved to ingeo friends earlier this cypress 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:05.450
 It's made up of two layers of stones. 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:11.000
 I can sleep really well as there is a saying that sleep is a cure. 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:13.549
 This bed is made of high-tech non - woven wood with a heating system and loess 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.790
 Consisting of Big traditional n 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:22.489
 You can feel the ondol culture as it is 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:27.410
 A heat pipe within one minute after the warming hot go up to 120 degrees loess 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:33.140
 It's a clip heating system that allows the radiant heat to propagate through the plain wood. 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:34.700
 The second row is from the blood vessels of the blood vessels and can be felt throughout the body. 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:40.940
 There is 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:46.010
 After 18 years of research and development, 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:50.989
 Instead of using conventional electric heat , heat to level and heat ocher to make it hot. 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:53.600
 Because of this, we are developing a technology that does not generate electromagnetic waves , 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:57.830
 I fully implemented it. 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:02.320
 We do not use electric hot wire that the heated vapor effects 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:05.270
 We are using heat pipes because we do not use electric keys 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:10.400
 No electromagnetic waves at all 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:14.420
 Also, you can see the effect of the security assistant, which has hot head and cold feet. 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:19.820
 Blood circulation improves and fatigue can be released quickly 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:24.920
 Technologies that use screws to deliver more than 1000 times more heat than copper 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.970
 Heating the inside temperature of the heater using the semiconductor bull radiation delivered to cypress 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.160
 Into the system 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:33.920
 Once heated, the surface temperature is reduced to 60 degrees 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.160
 Can keep up to 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:43.040
 Through this, the heating cost is reduced drastically 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:48.800
 Thermostatic Semiconductor Man Preventing Hers Burn Hazards That Buy Feathers 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:50.420
 The reasons for its high quality and performance are also self-produced. 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.700
 Maybe not. 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:04:01.599
 You 're doing everything from beginning to end . 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:04.300
 He has the whole process from assembly to quality assurance, 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:07.780
 We are all doing it on our own 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:13.660
 More than 40 years old, especially domestic 3 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:15.640
 We are stubborn only with the wood. We also notice that the tree is twisted or cracked 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:21.160
 To minimize it 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:26.919
 There is considerable care in natural drying and drying processes 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:30.970
 Small Business Administration is recognized as a small solid-tech products and technologies regarding domestic light 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:35.740
 Those products acquired by overseas patents 8 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.940
 So popular with the customers and the various certificates of these ensuring a credible technology 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.970
 Products 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.970
 It is produced in its own factory in Hwasun, Jeonnam 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.440
 These are not only furnished Oleallik furniture, but also the wall and ceiling of the house 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:00.360
 Constructed with plain wood 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:06.060
 Home made there also apply to install giving technologies as electroless trial Duanfang 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:11.190
 You can feel the feeling of relaxing on the water side with space 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:15.570
 Poaceae thousand mountains to the sea and to all plastered with cypress trees of the same nature 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:21.720
 What is the specific nature of this energetic rune? 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:25.860
 4 We use healing and well-being space from floor to ceiling 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:30.750
 The construction and dizziness that can be called crystals 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:36.570
 I feel a sense of security in the woods because the whole is made of uneven wood 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:40.080
 In summer and winter the heating can be installed under-floor heating on the ground, including naengbangbi 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:44.820
 You can also save electricity costs 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:48.090
 In addition, we used a cypress cypress interior with heated systems 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:51.720
 We are also consulting on housing construction. 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:54.750
 We use a cotton bed made by our family. 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:58.740
 There are quite a lot of people who are healthy. 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:03.600
 I'm getting a lot of repurchase They're made with the introduction of recommendations 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:06.840
 Everyone you use can get good health and sleep well 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:12.600
 I feel quite rewarding for being 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:16.230
 To further develop this technology in the future of our people around the world to the edge Moth 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:21.930
 I will lead the way in seeing your culture. 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:27.510
 If the riding temperature rises by 1 degree, the immunity increases 5 times. 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:32.210
 Natural materials of cypress trees and their five more times in health beds made of loess 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:32.210
 Why do not we see healthy day meeting records
