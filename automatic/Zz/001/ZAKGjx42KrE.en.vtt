dueling in the Grand Arena you know in
an<00:00:28.949> arena<00:00:29.099> match<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:29.519> there<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.730> line-of-sight

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
an arena match so there is line-of-sight

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.310

and<00:00:30.449> stuff<00:00:30.599> like<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.080> want<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.260> go

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
and stuff like that so you want to go

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.080 
and stuff like that so you want to go
with<00:00:31.439> blazing<00:00:31.830> speed<00:00:31.859> over<00:00:32.309> presence<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.820> mind

with blazing speed over presence of mind

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.850 
with blazing speed over presence of mind
because<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.899> can<00:00:34.050> kite<00:00:34.320> around<00:00:34.559> the

because you can kite around the

because you can kite around the
line-of-sight<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.579> if<00:00:36.000> they're<00:00:36.210> running

line-of-sight and if they're running

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.000 
line-of-sight and if they're running
away<00:00:36.750> from<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.290> can<00:00:37.410> catch<00:00:37.590> them<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> lot

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
away from you you can catch them a lot

easier presence of mind for the open

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.360 
easier presence of mind for the open
just<00:00:40.170> gives<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.500> much<00:00:40.620> cleaner<00:00:40.920> opener

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
just gives you a much cleaner opener

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.799 
just gives you a much cleaner opener
since<00:00:41.579> it's<00:00:41.760> not<00:00:41.879> going<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.149> be<00:00:42.239> line-of-sight

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
since it's not going to be line-of-sight

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.990 
since it's not going to be line-of-sight
it<00:00:43.500> doesn't<00:00:43.800> really<00:00:43.890> matter<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.280> much<00:00:44.430> to

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
it doesn't really matter that much to

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.510 
it doesn't really matter that much to
have<00:00:45.270> blazing<00:00:45.629> speed<00:00:45.809> against<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.230> caster<00:00:46.559> for

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
glyph it reduces its duration but it

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.049 
glyph it reduces its duration but it
also<00:01:01.230> takes<00:01:01.530> up<00:01:01.680> gcd<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:02.579> much<00:01:02.760> more

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
also takes up gcd so it's much more

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
cooldowns dispersion and shrink it so

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.210 
cooldowns dispersion and shrink it so
you're<00:01:16.200> pretty<00:01:16.350> much<00:01:16.560> going<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.830> be<00:01:16.890> trying<00:01:17.159> to

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
you're pretty much going to be trying to

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.440 
you're pretty much going to be trying to
get<00:01:17.310> dispersion<00:01:17.850> out<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.060> way<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.360> they

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
get dispersion out of the way and they

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.640 
get dispersion out of the way and they
get<00:01:18.570> shrink<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.900> out<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.140> way<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.470> once

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
get shrink it out of the way and once

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.020 
get shrink it out of the way and once
they<00:01:19.799> don't<00:01:20.040> have<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.460> they're<00:01:20.640> pretty<00:01:20.820> much

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
they don't have that they're pretty much

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.390 
they don't have that they're pretty much
dead<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.590> want<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.860> survive<00:01:23.100> until

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
dead so you want to survive until

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.560 
dead so you want to survive until
they're<00:01:23.640> out<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.759> cooldowns<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.299> then<00:01:24.479> you

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
they're out of cooldowns and then you

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.380 
they're out of cooldowns and then you
kill<00:01:24.750> them<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.619> decrease<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.759> your<00:01:27.180> first

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
kill them in a decrease so your first

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.240 
kill them in a decrease so your first
deep<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:28.080> want<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.320> do<00:01:28.409> something<00:01:28.740> like<00:01:28.890> orb

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
deep you want to do something like orb

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.630
