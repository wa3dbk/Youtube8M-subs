00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.410
 American psychologist john stacy 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.349
 adams this theory is based on 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.420
 statement that people are subjective 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:34.820
 estimate the ratio between the spent 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.829
 efforts and rewards received and 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.140
 compare this ratio with 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.920
 indicators of other people performing 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.920
 same job 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.610
 according to adams feeling 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.710
 injustice arises from workers 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.610
 situations when he feels that 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.460
 the return relationship that he gets to 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.220
 his contribution to the work 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.089
 unequal to the corresponding ratio 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.089
 other workers 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:16.190
 what factors of contribution and return takes into account 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:21.110
 employee education 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:23.660
 age by diligence status are 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:29.090
 factors contributing to the work according to 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:32.000
 employee salary accordingly 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.060
 other payments status of promotion 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.289
 service interesting job working conditions 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.890
 all this 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:43.869
 are factors of potential returns for 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.869
 diligence exhibited by an employee 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:54.130
 adams considers 6 possible reactions 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.130
 apparent injustice 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.950
 reduction of employees' own costs 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.950
 energy 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.690
 an attempt to increase the reward for your 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:11.360
 labor for example the form of requirements change 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.580
 self esteem such as lowering 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.380
 confidence in yourself and your strengths and 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:21.260
 abilities attempt to influence 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.940
 organization to change the payment or 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.940
 load of other employees 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:32.630
 choosing another comparison object for yourself 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.530
 and finally an attempt to move on to another 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.959
 subdivision 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:42.170
 or another primary organization 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:45.050
 practical conclusion of theories experienced 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.120
 the manager should track reactions 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.380
 subordinates and time to eliminate 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.380
 emerging contradictions
