damage and you know that one back there
I<00:00:33.610> don't<00:00:33.910> anticipate<00:00:34.149> on<00:00:34.719> any<00:00:35.079> oil<00:00:35.350> cannon

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
I don't anticipate on any oil cannon

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:37.920 
I don't anticipate on any oil cannon
going<00:00:36.010> on<00:00:36.280> but<00:00:37.120> we'll<00:00:37.270> just<00:00:37.420> include<00:00:37.720> that

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
damage and with this one right here it

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.979 
damage and with this one right here it
is<00:00:41.320> a<00:00:41.350> pretty<00:00:41.770> nice<00:00:41.950> size<00:00:42.220> I<00:00:42.489> mean<00:00:45.630> you<00:00:46.630> can<00:00:46.780> set

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
is a pretty nice size I mean you can set

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.500 
is a pretty nice size I mean you can set
that<00:00:47.140> water<00:00:47.800> bottle<00:00:48.250> in<00:00:48.460> it<00:00:48.760> and<00:00:48.820> you<00:00:49.420> can

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
that water bottle in it and you can

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.690 
that water bottle in it and you can
still<00:00:49.780> see<00:00:49.809> considerable<00:00:50.410> stretch<00:00:50.980> from<00:00:51.309> this

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:51.700 
still see considerable stretch from this

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.150 
still see considerable stretch from this
side<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:53.020> that<00:00:53.050> side<00:00:53.230> so<00:00:55.829> just<00:00:56.829> have<00:00:56.950> to<00:00:57.070> have

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
side to that side so just have to have

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.299 
side to that side so just have to have
you<00:00:57.280> guys<00:00:57.430> stay<00:00:57.760> tuned<00:00:58.090> and<00:00:58.950> you<00:00:59.950> know<00:01:00.070> I<00:01:00.100> made

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
you guys stay tuned and you know I made

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.780 
you guys stay tuned and you know I made
a<00:01:00.989> comment<00:01:01.989> to<00:01:02.290> the<00:01:02.860> owner<00:01:03.040> of<00:01:03.280> this<00:01:03.520> car

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
a comment to the owner of this car

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.429 
a comment to the owner of this car
especially<00:01:04.329> about<00:01:04.449> that<00:01:04.719> one<00:01:04.930> right<00:01:04.960> there

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
especially about that one right there

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.160 
especially about that one right there
that<00:01:05.549> there<00:01:06.549> maybe<00:01:06.850> a<00:01:07.060> little<00:01:07.179> of<00:01:07.630> what<00:01:07.959> we

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
that there maybe a little of what we

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.050 
that there maybe a little of what we
would<00:01:08.409> call<00:01:08.649> or<00:01:09.249> what<00:01:09.459> Sal<00:01:09.759> would<00:01:09.969> call<00:01:12.060> funny

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
would call or what Sal would call funny

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.639 
would call or what Sal would call funny
business<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:15.240> maybe<00:01:16.240> I<00:01:16.329> can<00:01:16.539> keep<00:01:16.719> it<00:01:16.869> from<00:01:17.049> any

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
business so maybe I can keep it from any

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.559 
business so maybe I can keep it from any
funny<00:01:17.950> business<00:01:18.039> being<00:01:18.700> down<00:01:19.090> there<00:01:19.359> in<00:01:19.479> the

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:19.569 
funny business being down there in the

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:24.330 
funny business being down there in the
middle<00:01:19.659> that<00:01:19.840> or<00:01:21.569> maybe<00:01:22.649> there<00:01:23.649> will<00:01:23.799> be<00:01:23.979> so

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
middle that or maybe there will be so

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.149 
middle that or maybe there will be so
anyhow<00:01:25.329> stay<00:01:25.569> tuned<00:01:25.779> and<00:01:26.020> we'll<00:01:26.920> see<00:01:27.069> how

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
anyhow stay tuned and we'll see how

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.629 
anyhow stay tuned and we'll see how
these<00:01:27.279> come<00:01:27.459> out<00:01:28.979> alright<00:01:29.979> I<00:01:30.039> also<00:01:30.249> want<00:01:30.609> to

00:01:30.629 --> 00:01:30.639 
these come out alright I also want to

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:32.309 
these come out alright I also want to
say<00:01:30.880> that<00:01:31.119> we<00:01:31.359> pulled<00:01:31.569> the<00:01:31.659> headliner<00:01:31.990> out<00:01:32.200> of

00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:32.319 
say that we pulled the headliner out of

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:35.399 
say that we pulled the headliner out of
this<00:01:32.469> thing<00:01:32.709> and<00:01:33.329> I'm<00:01:34.329> going<00:01:34.450> to<00:01:34.539> be<00:01:34.630> using<00:01:35.170> a

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
this thing and I'm going to be using a

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.319 
this thing and I'm going to be using a
friend<00:01:36.189> of<00:01:36.279> mine<00:01:36.840> Seth<00:01:37.840> Byerly<00:01:39.090> when<00:01:40.090> using

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
friend of mine Seth Byerly when using

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:43.319 
friend of mine Seth Byerly when using
his<00:01:40.539> off<00:01:40.749> dolly<00:01:41.109> technique<00:01:41.909> by<00:01:42.909> putting<00:01:43.240> a

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
his off dolly technique by putting a

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:48.059 
his off dolly technique by putting a
prop<00:01:43.689> rod<00:01:44.549> from<00:01:45.549> the<00:01:45.639> seat<00:01:46.169> up<00:01:47.169> to<00:01:47.439> the<00:01:47.560> ceiling

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:48.069 
prop rod from the seat up to the ceiling

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:50.069 
prop rod from the seat up to the ceiling
and<00:01:48.249> kind<00:01:48.520> of<00:01:48.579> pulling<00:01:48.939> some<00:01:49.119> metal<00:01:49.450> away<00:01:49.840> from

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
and kind of pulling some metal away from

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.870 
and kind of pulling some metal away from
that<00:01:50.259> dent<00:01:50.590> and<00:01:51.279> I'm<00:01:51.369> gonna<00:01:51.459> put<00:01:51.609> it<00:01:51.700> right

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
that dent and I'm gonna put it right

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.409 
that dent and I'm gonna put it right
near<00:01:52.119> that<00:01:52.179> brace<00:01:53.459> that's<00:01:54.459> the<00:01:54.909> other<00:01:55.119> dents

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:55.419 
near that brace that's the other dents

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:58.349 
near that brace that's the other dents
actually<00:01:56.020> underneath<00:01:56.499> so<00:01:57.149> anyhow<00:01:58.149> this<00:01:58.299> is

00:01:58.349 --> 00:01:58.359 
actually underneath so anyhow this is

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:59.909 
actually underneath so anyhow this is
the<00:01:58.450> first<00:01:58.659> time<00:01:58.810> I'm<00:01:58.959> trying<00:01:58.989> this<00:01:59.439> technique

00:01:59.909 --> 00:01:59.919 
the first time I'm trying this technique

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:01.559 
the first time I'm trying this technique
so<00:02:00.099> I<00:02:00.159> want<00:02:00.369> to<00:02:00.459> go<00:02:00.549> ahead<00:02:00.639> and<00:02:00.849> document<00:02:01.450> it

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
so I want to go ahead and document it

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.469 
so I want to go ahead and document it
and<00:02:02.549> hopefully<00:02:03.549> it'll<00:02:03.880> be<00:02:03.999> a<00:02:04.029> useful

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
and hopefully it'll be a useful

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.209 
and hopefully it'll be a useful
technique<00:02:04.659> that<00:02:05.139> we<00:02:05.590> could<00:02:05.739> all<00:02:05.829> use<00:02:05.859> in<00:02:06.159> the

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
technique that we could all use in the

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:10.070 
technique that we could all use in the
future<00:02:06.489> so<00:02:07.179> anyhow<00:02:07.509> here's<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:07.989> setup<00:02:08.410> so<00:02:08.649> far

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
future so anyhow here's the setup so far

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.370 
future so anyhow here's the setup so far
got<00:02:11.080> it<00:02:11.260> a<00:02:12.390> leverage<00:02:13.390> down<00:02:13.630> here<00:02:14.020> from<00:02:14.260> the

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
got it a leverage down here from the

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.800 
got it a leverage down here from the
floor<00:02:14.740> on<00:02:15.040> up

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
floor on up

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.809 
floor on up
now<00:02:16.020> I'm<00:02:16.170> going<00:02:16.319> to<00:02:16.350> try<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.740> smaller<00:02:17.459> side

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
now I'm going to try the smaller side

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.730 
now I'm going to try the smaller side
there's<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.300> as<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:19.440> see<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.680> smaller<00:02:20.569> end<00:02:21.740> and

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
there's a as you see a smaller end and

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.190 
there's a as you see a smaller end and
this<00:02:23.520> side<00:02:23.760> has<00:02:23.970> actually<00:02:24.330> got<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.660> larger

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
this side has actually got the larger

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.250 
this side has actually got the larger
end<00:02:25.670> down<00:02:26.670> on<00:02:26.940> it<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:27.720> I'm<00:02:27.810> going<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:27.990> see<00:02:28.110> how

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
end down on it so I'm going to see how

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.830 
end down on it so I'm going to see how
the<00:02:28.319> dent<00:02:28.680> reacts<00:02:29.100> with<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.610> smaller<00:02:30.120> end<00:02:30.510> up

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
the dent reacts with the smaller end up

this<00:03:33.930> den<00:03:34.170> up<00:03:34.320> I<00:03:34.440> am<00:03:34.739> 10<00:03:35.220> Oh<00:03:35.600> Ryan<00:03:36.600> I<00:03:36.750> know<00:03:36.810> we

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
this den up I am 10 Oh Ryan I know we

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.650 
this den up I am 10 Oh Ryan I know we
didn't<00:03:37.290> time<00:03:37.470> it<00:03:37.500> but<00:03:37.860> how<00:03:38.670> long<00:03:38.850> are<00:03:39.000> we<00:03:39.030> into

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
didn't time it but how long are we into

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.949 
didn't time it but how long are we into
this<00:03:40.700> so<00:03:41.700> we're<00:03:41.850> about<00:03:42.000> 10<00:03:42.269> minutes<00:03:42.299> into<00:03:42.840> this

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
this so we're about 10 minutes into this

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.130 
this so we're about 10 minutes into this
thing<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:44.269> the<00:03:45.269> reason<00:03:45.570> why<00:03:45.660> it<00:03:45.720> still<00:03:45.930> looks

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
thing and the reason why it still looks

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.199 
thing and the reason why it still looks
high<00:03:46.290> obviously<00:03:46.890> is<00:03:47.100> because<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.760> prop<00:03:47.970> rod

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
high obviously is because the prop rod

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.270 
high obviously is because the prop rod
still<00:03:48.510> up<00:03:48.630> there<00:03:48.660> and<00:03:49.200> now<00:03:49.680> what<00:03:49.890> I've<00:03:50.010> noticed

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
still up there and now what I've noticed

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.759 
still up there and now what I've noticed
is<00:03:50.609> once<00:03:50.880> I<00:03:51.060> was<00:03:51.209> able<00:03:51.329> to<00:03:51.480> make<00:03:51.769> concentrated

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
is once I was able to make concentrated

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.210 
is once I was able to make concentrated
pushes<00:03:53.190> in<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.370> center<00:03:53.790> of<00:03:53.820> that<00:03:54.030> dent<00:03:54.390> and<00:03:55.220> it

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
pushes in the center of that dent and it

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.000 
pushes in the center of that dent and it
never<00:03:56.640> moved<00:03:57.030> never<00:03:57.510> got<00:03:57.780> flimsy<00:03:58.350> it<00:03:58.530> held<00:03:58.859> it

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
never moved never got flimsy it held it

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.800 
never moved never got flimsy it held it
tight<00:03:59.220> to<00:03:59.430> where<00:03:59.519> I<00:03:59.579> could<00:03:59.850> just<00:04:00.420> make<00:04:00.600> all
