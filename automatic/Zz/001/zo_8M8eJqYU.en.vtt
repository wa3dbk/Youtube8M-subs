00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.840 
I did check the dimensions before
ordering<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.590> knew<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.070> would<00:01:11.220> be<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.400> size

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
ordering so I knew it would be this size

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.940 
ordering so I knew it would be this size
and<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.659> reason<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.260> wanted<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.650> buy<00:01:13.890> this

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.399 
and the reason that I wanted to buy this
was<00:01:14.369> because<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.880> had<00:01:14.939> seen<00:01:15.479> clutches<00:01:16.170> that

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
was because I had seen clutches that

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.280 
was because I had seen clutches that
were<00:01:16.500> similar<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.990> anthropology<00:01:18.990> and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
were similar to this in anthropology and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.429 
were similar to this in anthropology and
also<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:19.860> wendy's<00:01:20.400> lookbook<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.930> really

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
also on wendy's lookbook and I really

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.830 
also on wendy's lookbook and I really
really<00:01:22.799> loved<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.520> size<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.090> look<00:01:24.390> but<00:01:24.780> I

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840

about<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:39.960> clutch<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.979> it's<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.299> poofy

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
about this clutch is that it's so poofy

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
like it's quite um padded I guess it's

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.730 
like it's quite um padded I guess it's
like<00:01:46.700> puffy<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.909> pillow<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.140> wasn't

expecting<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.549> thought<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:51.000> would<00:01:51.090> be<00:01:51.240> a

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
expecting that I thought it would be a

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.539 
expecting that I thought it would be a
little<00:01:51.479> more<00:01:51.750> sleek<00:01:52.140> but<00:01:52.649> even<00:01:52.979> still<00:01:53.130> I'm

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
little more sleek but even still I'm

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.130 
little more sleek but even still I'm
very<00:01:53.759> happy<00:01:54.090> with<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.810> puffiness

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
very happy with it and the puffiness

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.139 
very happy with it and the puffiness
actually<00:01:55.770> makes<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.250> little<00:01:56.399> bit<00:01:56.549> easier<00:01:56.969> to

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
actually makes it a little bit easier to

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.910 
actually makes it a little bit easier to
hold<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.719> grip<00:01:57.960> on<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.290> when<00:01:58.590> there<00:01:58.740> aren't

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
hold and grip on to when there aren't

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.249 
hold and grip on to when there aren't
that<00:01:59.130> many<00:01:59.189> things<00:01:59.670> inside<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:00.869> can't<00:02:01.110> wait

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
that many things inside so I can't wait

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.569

00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:55.659 
the one thing i want to add is it does

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:57.629 
the one thing i want to add is it does
apply<00:04:56.139> a<00:04:56.229> little<00:04:56.620> bit<00:04:56.710> thick<00:04:57.129> does<00:04:57.430> get<00:04:57.610> a

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
apply a little bit thick does get a

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.399 
apply a little bit thick does get a
little<00:04:57.789> bit<00:04:58.000> hard<00:04:58.180> to<00:04:58.240> work<00:04:58.479> with<00:04:58.629> at<00:04:58.810> times<00:04:58.990> I

00:04:59.399 --> 00:04:59.409 
little bit hard to work with at times I

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:01.860 
little bit hard to work with at times I
just<00:04:59.979> try<00:05:00.129> to<00:05:00.159> work<00:05:00.430> really<00:05:00.639> fast<00:05:00.759> and<00:05:01.360> then<00:05:01.419> I

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
just try to work really fast and then I

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.200 
just try to work really fast and then I
put<00:05:02.050> the<00:05:02.169> cap<00:05:02.319> back<00:05:02.349> on<00:05:02.740> in<00:05:03.129> between<00:05:03.490> hand<00:05:03.969> I

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
put the cap back on in between hand I

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.170 
put the cap back on in between hand I
find<00:05:04.569> that<00:05:04.690> works<00:05:05.199> for<00:05:05.500> me<00:05:05.680> but<00:05:06.180> the

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
find that works for me but the

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.300 
find that works for me but the
formulation<00:05:07.780> is<00:05:07.990> a<00:05:08.349> little<00:05:08.650> bit<00:05:08.740> thick<00:05:09.039> and

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
formulation is a little bit thick and

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.360

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
really pretty gold color but it's kind

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.730 
really pretty gold color but it's kind
of<00:06:03.520> like<00:06:03.639> a<00:06:03.699> lighter<00:06:04.120> muted<00:06:04.839> gold<00:06:05.110> color<00:06:05.440> I

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
of like a lighter muted gold color I

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.529 
of like a lighter muted gold color I
think<00:06:06.190> it's<00:06:06.310> really<00:06:06.580> pretty<00:06:06.759> and<00:06:07.150> I'm

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
think it's really pretty and I'm

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:09.570 
think it's really pretty and I'm
actually<00:06:07.719> pretty<00:06:08.080> excited<00:06:08.349> to<00:06:08.860> try<00:06:09.069> this<00:06:09.129> one

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
actually pretty excited to try this one

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.059 
actually pretty excited to try this one
out<00:06:09.789> got<00:06:10.120> very<00:06:10.389> fine<00:06:10.810> micro<00:06:11.379> glitter<00:06:11.650> in<00:06:11.919> it

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:12.069 
out got very fine micro glitter in it

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:15.480 
out got very fine micro glitter in it
and<00:06:12.310> I<00:06:13.150> think<00:06:13.870> it<00:06:14.110> would<00:06:14.259> apply<00:06:14.680> quite<00:06:15.069> sheer

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
and I think it would apply quite sheer

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.629 
and I think it would apply quite sheer
but<00:06:15.759> hopefully<00:06:16.120> it'll<00:06:16.270> be<00:06:16.449> buildable<00:06:17.080> to

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 
but hopefully it'll be buildable to

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:20.430 
but hopefully it'll be buildable to
reasonable<00:06:18.639> opacity<00:06:19.240> so<00:06:19.569> that<00:06:19.750> is<00:06:19.900> it<00:06:19.930> for<00:06:20.080> my

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
reasonable opacity so that is it for my

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.249 
reasonable opacity so that is it for my
julep<00:06:21.009> gold<00:06:21.310> glamour<00:06:21.729> mystery<00:06:22.419> clutch<00:06:22.719> again
