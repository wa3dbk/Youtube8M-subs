00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.350
 put on a bit of luxury but you have to 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.630
 I think these houses will be fine 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.490
 no that hummer how these houses 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.049
 are equipped with every luxury are one 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.460
 bit in the step screen colors 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:34.330
 furnished 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.729
 also with a typical traditional 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.229
 colors in the neighborhood 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.300
 well have a speed where one 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.920
 flat screen so all the conveniences and because that 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.030
 you can actually do that in environment and 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.590
 at the camping 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.690
 no I of course who for the 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.369
 seniors is a sufficient here 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.929
 possibility that an act and cycle 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.220
 and for the 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.990
 in high season for the children 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.460
 here animation and everything and what about it 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.690
 then actually with the atmosphere of the 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.940
 camping because I assume there is something 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.649
 changed with the advent of luxury 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.179
 who you have to say as a 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.429
 other type of gas valves we are from 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:04.720
 origin and the and mobile home park 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.380
 but well we now get more tourists 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.390
 and but you see that more focused 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.890
 on luxury and such but if you like 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.180
 would like to go camping with your tent 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.290
 it also still no plan this no 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.730
 only problem 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.050
 get your help to your caravan or 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.920
 budget and because the market 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.239
 nothing out 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.069
 and talked about that 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.450
 actually with the sanitary facilities 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.250
 the sanitary facilities are common 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.959
 present and it has even been thought of 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.550
 children and then the disabled 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.040
 so I also put the toilet roll over that 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.840
 camping to walk the toilet roll is passÃ© 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.129
 look at it delicious and it says 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.290
 here a delicious lunch ready for us 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.670
 so i would say let's get to it 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.230
 start and then also the 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.650
 help camping ok eat tasty 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.650
 tasty 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.080
 No 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.260
 that is beautiful 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.299
 a 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:01.580
 and that little one to my day is not possible 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.580
 seemed more justified
