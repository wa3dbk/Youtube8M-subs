00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
I real life okay so I'll basically want

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.179 
I real life okay so I'll basically want
to<00:00:04.049> take<00:00:04.410> take<00:00:04.770> take<00:00:05.220> that<00:00:06.000> pressure<00:00:06.180> down<00:00:07.189> so

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
to take take take that pressure down so

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.810 
to take take take that pressure down so
i<00:00:08.220> want<00:00:08.670> to<00:00:08.730> show<00:00:09.320> is<00:00:10.320> this<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.340> that<00:00:11.370> this

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
i want to show is this is that this

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.080 
i want to show is this is that this
actuator<00:00:12.809> has<00:00:13.259> dual<00:00:13.559> port<00:00:15.770> you<00:00:16.770> just<00:00:17.670> use<00:00:17.880> this

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
actuator has dual port you just use this

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.230 
actuator has dual port you just use this
port<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.539> works<00:00:18.690> just<00:00:18.810> like<00:00:19.050> stock<00:00:20.180> you<00:00:21.180> can

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
port it works just like stock you can

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.130 
port it works just like stock you can
see<00:00:21.630> as<00:00:22.140> we<00:00:22.470> put<00:00:23.480> mess<00:00:24.480> with<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.720> pleasure<00:00:25.080> to

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
see as we put mess with a pleasure to

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.480 
see as we put mess with a pleasure to
turn<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.320> pressure<00:00:25.590> all<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.830> way<00:00:25.980> down

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.320 

that's<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.580> pressure<00:00:29.820> all<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.000> way<00:00:30.150> down

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
that's the pressure all the way down

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.630 
that's the pressure all the way down
slowly<00:00:30.779> turn<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.170> pressure<00:00:31.410> off<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:32.460> could

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
slowly turn the pressure off you could

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.729 
slowly turn the pressure off you could
watch<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:32.969> just<00:00:33.660> start<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.140> open<00:00:34.290> at<00:00:34.649> 12<00:00:35.190> pounds

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
watch it just start to open at 12 pounds

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.979 
watch it just start to open at 12 pounds
it's<00:00:37.739> just<00:00:38.219> opening<00:00:38.670> hard<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.480> see<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.780> move

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
it's just opening hard to see it move

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.230 
it's just opening hard to see it move
but<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.379> did<00:00:40.940> let's<00:00:41.940> press<00:00:42.210> your<00:00:42.390> back<00:00:42.510> off

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:44.240 
but it did let's press your back off

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.799 
but it did let's press your back off
state<00:00:44.870> move<00:00:45.190> okay<00:00:46.190> now<00:00:46.370> pick<00:00:46.640> up<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:46.880> 20-pound

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.850 

okay<00:00:50.809> so<00:00:50.870> that<00:00:51.260> now<00:00:51.500> you<00:00:51.559> let<00:00:51.980> it<00:00:52.129> off<00:00:53.649> push<00:00:54.649> it

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
okay so that now you let it off push it

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.020 
okay so that now you let it off push it
20

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.609 

there<00:01:00.600> we<00:01:00.719> go<00:01:00.980> 25<00:01:01.980> feet<00:01:02.309> opening<00:01:03.170> but<00:01:04.170> opening

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
there we go 25 feet opening but opening

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.330 
there we go 25 feet opening but opening
the<00:01:04.680> valve<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:05.880> if<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.210> hold<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.540> open<00:01:07.340> and

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
the valve so if you hold it open and

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.649 
the valve so if you hold it open and
then<00:01:08.490> what<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.790> can<00:01:09.000> do<00:01:10.610> you<00:01:11.610> put<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.360> same

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
then what you can do you put the same

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.840 
then what you can do you put the same
booth<00:01:13.020> pressure<00:01:13.409> back<00:01:13.890> on<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.820> side<00:01:16.729> let<00:01:17.729> me

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
booth pressure back on this side let me

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.510 
booth pressure back on this side let me
try<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.119> demonstrate

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
try to demonstrate

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.779 
try to demonstrate
don't<00:01:19.939> a<00:01:20.060> seat<00:01:20.329> open<00:01:20.950> hold<00:01:21.950> it<00:01:22.130> it<00:01:22.340> just<00:01:22.399> keep

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
don't a seat open hold it it just keep

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:31.360 
don't a seat open hold it it just keep
home<00:01:23.390> it'll<00:01:24.520> put<00:01:25.520> this<00:01:25.729> on<00:01:26.000> here

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.430 

involvement

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440

okay<00:01:37.130> so<00:01:37.640> now<00:01:37.820> it's<00:01:38.150> open<00:01:39.070> actually<00:01:40.070> to<00:01:40.130> take

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
okay so now it's open actually to take

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.780 
okay so now it's open actually to take
this<00:01:40.460> back<00:01:40.700> off<00:01:40.910> let<00:01:41.210> off<00:01:41.980> just<00:01:42.980> see<00:01:43.580> it<00:01:43.760> now

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
this back off let off just see it now

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.960 
this back off let off just see it now
open<00:01:44.630> it<00:01:44.750> there's<00:01:45.620> 20<00:01:46.190> pounds<00:01:46.400> boobs<00:01:46.670> just

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
open it there's 20 pounds boobs just

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.100 
open it there's 20 pounds boobs just
open<00:01:47.120> it<00:01:47.330> up<00:01:47.680> put<00:01:48.680> this<00:01:48.830> line<00:01:49.160> on<00:01:49.690> same<00:01:50.690> 20

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
open it up put this line on same 20

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.820 
open it up put this line on same 20
pounds<00:01:51.620> it<00:01:51.740> shuts<00:01:52.010> it<00:01:52.130> back<00:01:52.310> boxes<00:01:52.850> back<00:01:53.060> down

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
pounds it shuts it back boxes back down

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.920 
pounds it shuts it back boxes back down
so<00:01:54.830> you<00:01:55.340> could<00:01:55.670> run<00:01:55.910> maximum<00:01:56.510> boost<00:01:56.690> to

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
so you could run maximum boost to

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.080 
so you could run maximum boost to
whatever<00:01:57.200> you<00:01:57.320> want<00:01:57.500> now<00:01:57.740> this<00:01:58.400> is<00:01:58.460> triple
