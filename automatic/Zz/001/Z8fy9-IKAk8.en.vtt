00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.359 
that then after a while I also branched
off<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.780> made<00:00:16.199> my<00:00:16.350> own<00:00:16.379> little<00:00:16.619> experiment

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369

turns<00:02:16.470> out<00:02:16.740> that<00:02:16.800> over<00:02:17.490> a<00:02:17.550> distance<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.840> can<00:02:18.870> be

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
turns out that over a distance it can be

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.520 
turns out that over a distance it can be
quite<00:02:19.560> difficult<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.900> tell<00:02:21.900> whether<00:02:22.110> where

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
quite difficult to tell whether where

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.940 
quite difficult to tell whether where
they<00:02:22.710> will<00:02:23.430> end<00:02:23.490> up<00:02:24.110> so<00:02:25.110> that's<00:02:25.290> not<00:02:25.440> great<00:02:25.650> but

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
they will end up so that's not great but

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.750 
they will end up so that's not great but
it<00:02:26.190> works<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:27.500> you<00:02:28.500> go<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:28.890> can<00:02:29.310> also<00:02:29.430> kill

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
it works and you go you can also kill

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.050 
it works and you go you can also kill
the<00:02:29.850> cactuses<00:02:30.270> because<00:02:31.820> some<00:02:32.820> reason<00:02:35.060> my

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
the cactuses because some reason my

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.950 
the cactuses because some reason my
father<00:02:36.240> would<00:02:36.570> be<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.720> good<00:02:36.870> idea<00:02:37.490> and<00:02:38.960> here's

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
father would be a good idea and here's

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.480 
father would be a good idea and here's
the<00:02:40.170> end<00:02:40.260> of<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.470> level<00:02:41.090> it<00:02:42.090> is<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.510> evil<00:02:42.960> cave

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
the end of the level it is the evil cave

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.730 
the end of the level it is the evil cave
where<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.610> evil<00:02:44.880> pets<00:02:45.120> come<00:02:45.360> from<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.780> as<00:02:46.620> you

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
where the evil pets come from and as you

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.500 
where the evil pets come from and as you
can<00:02:46.860> probably<00:02:46.890> see<00:02:47.220> there's<00:02:47.790> an<00:02:48.090> object

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
can probably see there's an object

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.060 
can probably see there's an object
they're<00:02:48.660> called<00:02:48.930> warp<00:02:49.200> which<00:02:49.620> should<00:02:49.920> be

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
they're called warp which should be

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.980 
they're called warp which should be
transparent<00:02:50.310> but<00:02:51.030> essence<00:02:51.450> because<00:02:51.750> i<00:02:51.870> am

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
transparent but essence because i am

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.440 
transparent but essence because i am
lazy<00:02:52.580> and<00:02:53.810> yeah<00:02:54.810> if<00:02:55.140> we<00:02:55.500> walk<00:02:55.950> into<00:02:56.190> it<00:02:56.459> we<00:02:57.120> will

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
lazy and yeah if we walk into it we will

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.230 
lazy and yeah if we walk into it we will
be<00:02:57.630> taken<00:02:57.990> to<00:02:58.020> level<00:02:58.440> 2<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:59.000> as<00:03:00.000> you<00:03:00.120> can

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
be taken to level 2 and as you can

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.600 
be taken to level 2 and as you can
probably<00:03:00.270> see<00:03:00.570> now<00:03:00.900> this<00:03:01.170> is<00:03:01.380> a

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
probably see now this is a

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.250 
probably see now this is a
side-scrolling<00:03:02.810> platformer<00:03:03.810> all<00:03:04.080> of<00:03:04.170> a

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
side-scrolling platformer all of a

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.560 
side-scrolling platformer all of a
sudden<00:03:04.290> because<00:03:04.730> that<00:03:05.730> sounded<00:03:06.180> like<00:03:06.330> fun

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
sudden because that sounded like fun

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.870 
sudden because that sounded like fun
thing<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.840> try<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:08.130> has<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.340> different<00:03:08.730> art

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
thing to try and it has a different art

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.250 
thing to try and it has a different art
style<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:10.550> so<00:03:12.050> significantly<00:03:13.050> better

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
style and so significantly better

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.880 
style and so significantly better
animations<00:03:15.260> because<00:03:16.260> it<00:03:16.380> turns<00:03:16.650> out<00:03:16.830> that

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
animations because it turns out that

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.800 
animations because it turns out that
even<00:03:17.160> a<00:03:17.340> tiny<00:03:17.640> little<00:03:17.970> bit<00:03:18.209> of<00:03:18.330> practice<00:03:18.690> of

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
even a tiny little bit of practice of

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.240 
even a tiny little bit of practice of
that<00:03:18.989> this<00:03:19.290> really<00:03:19.769> helps<00:03:20.450> so<00:03:21.450> that's<00:03:21.690> good<00:03:21.900> I

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
that this really helps so that's good I

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.840 
that this really helps so that's good I
don't<00:03:23.250> have<00:03:23.430> any<00:03:23.580> big<00:03:23.730> plans<00:03:23.910> for<00:03:24.090> this<00:03:24.330> I<00:03:24.720> will

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
don't have any big plans for this I will

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.759 
don't have any big plans for this I will
just<00:03:26.850> make<00:03:27.480> jumping<00:03:27.989> and<00:03:28.170> things<00:03:28.380> possible

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
just make jumping and things possible

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.070 
just make jumping and things possible
and<00:03:29.489> then<00:03:29.880> I'll<00:03:30.030> make<00:03:30.239> a<00:03:30.269> tiny<00:03:30.600> area<00:03:30.900> to

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
and then I'll make a tiny area to

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.630 
and then I'll make a tiny area to
explore<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:32.420> maybe<00:03:33.420> some<00:03:33.720> combat<00:03:34.080> like

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
explore and maybe some combat like

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.710 
explore and maybe some combat like
simple<00:03:35.640> very<00:03:35.910> simple<00:03:36.060> boss<00:03:36.360> fight<00:03:36.570> or

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
simple very simple boss fight or

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.070 
simple very simple boss fight or
something<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:37.440> then<00:03:37.890> I'll<00:03:38.040> probably<00:03:38.310> the

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
something and then I'll probably the

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.680 
something and then I'll probably the
dampener<00:03:40.080> with<00:03:40.739> this<00:03:40.950> sort<00:03:41.310> of<00:03:41.340> experiment<00:03:41.820> I

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
dampener with this sort of experiment I

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.320 
dampener with this sort of experiment I
there's<00:03:44.290> been<00:03:44.500> a<00:03:44.530> lot<00:03:44.740> of<00:03:45.030> really<00:03:46.030> first

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
there's been a lot of really first

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.990 
there's been a lot of really first
things<00:03:46.870> going<00:03:47.410> into<00:03:47.710> this<00:03:47.830> this<00:03:48.250> is<00:03:48.430> the<00:03:48.760> first

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
things going into this this is the first

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.240 
things going into this this is the first
time<00:03:49.330> I've<00:03:49.570> coated<00:03:50.050> something<00:03:50.740> it's<00:03:51.100> the

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
time I've coated something it's the

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.480 
time I've coated something it's the
first<00:03:51.490> time<00:03:51.760> I've<00:03:52.170> done<00:03:53.170> sort<00:03:53.440> of<00:03:53.500> digital<00:03:53.890> art

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
first time I've done sort of digital art

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.720 
first time I've done sort of digital art
drawing<00:03:55.090> painting<00:03:55.450> and<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.770> very<00:03:57.250> first<00:03:57.550> time

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
drawing painting and the very first time

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.360 
drawing painting and the very first time
I<00:03:57.790> try<00:03:58.060> to<00:03:58.090> animate<00:03:58.570> something<00:03:59.080> and<00:03:59.920> all<00:04:00.340> of

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
I try to animate something and all of

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.070 
I try to animate something and all of
those<00:04:00.580> things<00:04:00.640> are<00:04:01.150> really<00:04:01.390> difficult<00:04:01.660> and

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
those things are really difficult and

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.150 
those things are really difficult and
they<00:04:02.830> are<00:04:02.890> also<00:04:03.310> really<00:04:04.060> time<00:04:04.510> consuming<00:04:05.160> but

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
they are also really time consuming but

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.460 
they are also really time consuming but
they're<00:04:06.610> also<00:04:06.760> a<00:04:06.940> lot<00:04:07.150> of<00:04:07.180> fun<00:04:07.390> so<00:04:08.020> that's<00:04:08.290> good

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
they're also a lot of fun so that's good

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.980 
they're also a lot of fun so that's good
and<00:04:08.650> that's<00:04:08.680> about<00:04:09.520> all<00:04:09.670> I<00:04:10.300> have<00:04:10.630> to<00:04:10.780> show<00:04:10.810> for

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
and that's about all I have to show for

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.850 
and that's about all I have to show for
now<00:04:11.230> so<00:04:11.830> thanks<00:04:12.580> bye
