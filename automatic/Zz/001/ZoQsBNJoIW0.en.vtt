00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.510
 very good to all and welcome to me 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.890
 I am javito painter channel I do not bring you 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.980
 a new video becomes a new team 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.450
 cheap a new equipazo that I have 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.270
 put in the cheap equipment series 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.460
 because I think the team to learn 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.259
 how it yields is a very very cheap equipment 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.780
 like watching a team all players of 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:35.210
 silver all German players and all 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.030
 incredible players that although they are from 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.550
 silver because when you handle them, it seems that 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.040
 be of gold or even a category 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.110
 superior because they are beasts 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.899
 incredible and good as always I'm going to 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.070
 do a little analysis so you can see 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:49.879
 the number of players because if not the 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.109
 you know 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.120
 but before saying that you have in the 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:55.699
 my twitter twitter description for 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.100
 you want to follow me there's a link link 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.420
 of fuguet of this team in function and 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.890
 Many people ask me why not 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.589
 I say the price of the equipment and it's because if 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.940
 you put in you put next the price of 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.740
 equipment updated in case the players 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.140
 rise or fall in price but you have 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.330
 updated and well said this let's 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.600
 there with the team we have porte 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.729
 to web what this doorman that if I do not remember 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.740
 bad is if it touched me in an envelope as you see 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.150
 and I put it on because I did not want to see 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.700
 in the head 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.290
 looking in fuguet it is one of the best 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.550
 doormen perhaps there are some that can be 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.490
 better but this has worked for me 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.920
 very good is a very tall goalkeeper 190 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.930
 contribute what has 81 of reflections like 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.310
 you see for me a very complete goalkeeper and 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.170
 if you do not know who to put then I 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.600
 I recommend that you put this club in 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.950
 defense we have acquired and pum gert I think 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.680
 which are the two best defenses of 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.660
 German silver there is another one that was not 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.460
 I remember his name getting to make one 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.290
 with defense of three but what is it 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.300
 does with defense two these two are 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.310
 the best in combis we have 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.160
 defense statistics butts and 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.710
 current rate above 70 so already 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.750
 it is seen that they abuse of silver because they will yield 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.810
 pretty good then by the sides 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.700
 I have a lateral law of the 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.619
 better one knows it some knows it to 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.990
 I do not sound too much but good a 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.780
 player as you see with 83 of rhythm 73 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.130
 defense and 67 of very complete footwear and 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.690
 then on the left another player 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.630
 compensates for bright banana is very 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.790
 similar 82 of rhythm 71 defense and 73 of 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.400
 headbutts I think the defense is very 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.440
 good and if you use makes a defense of 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.550
 four silver Germans me 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.110
 I recommend is 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.760
 then we went to the center of the field a 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.950
 midfield that drives me crazy 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.050
 because they have impressive players 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.840
 I have found these bestial 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.330
 players tell you that yes yes if you do 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.310
 defense defense not mine the center of 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.120
 field with four with three players that 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.830
 I fight 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.200
 meat I do not lie as you see of these three 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.989
 but if you want to put it like this 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.209
 to arrange well or has been tested with 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.890
 all the ways and I the one that better 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.049
 is the one I like the most because 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.700
 the trochowski is of midfielders in 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.560
 time and goes up more to the attack but you see 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.230
 put as you want as seen have 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:05.370
 all three have a very decent pace 80 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.870
 80 76 and 82 then individually then 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.700
 I think the liner to give you an 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.709
 idea I compare it with car I think 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.290
 a player very similar to a car or if not 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:16.069
 the silver car is a player with a 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.140
 very very good rhythm a shot too 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.730
 pretty decent but above all what 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.340
 I like him is his agility and the way 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.349
 that in which it takes the steps then by the 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.519
 The lock must be and that initially 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.980
 has put him offensive midfielder 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:32.519
 that's why it was changing not even his 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.290
 letter but he 's a lefty with one with 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.239
 a very good chute power 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.430
 really liked his Suter else has 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:41.220
 a very good rhythm that there is to defend 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.420
 or to attack also and then up in 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.370
 the offensive center that I have put is 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.260
 trochowsky this player seemed like a 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.400
 authentic wonder to handle this 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.140
 player is I think I'm not going to 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.960
 to sell 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.270
 he is a player with a power of chute 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.440
 bestial has 5 stars of legs 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.540
 bad what does that in any 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.670
 position and with the leg that sticks it 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.890
 to give equal because very possibly 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.840
 finish in goal because you have a shot that 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.550
 it's really amazing is that I believe 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.780
 which is one of the best shooters I've ever 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.090
 tried so far in ultimate 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.520
 team 14 is a bestial chute not in addition 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.500
 it has a very good and good rhythm 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.490
 as an offensive midfielder or 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.080
 midfielder 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.109
 where do you want to put that is going to 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.070
 yield to a brilliant level then by 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.769
 the left end 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.080
 you have to see this position is the one that 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.880
 he was clear about him from the team because 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.500
 I had tried it on another computer and it was the 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.330
 player who liked me as 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.740
 is a player is bestial some 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.040
 incredible statistics to be of 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.200
 91 silver of 70 rhythm shot and 73 of 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.940
 butts maybe it's a shame it's not 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.950
 your position is not center forward 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.530
 because I think I could perform better 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.300
 but still it is if you want to compare 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.090
 with any of this year I would compare it 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.390
 with royce although physically I do not know 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.910
 many people seem to pay much forgiveness 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:55.040
 I think that in terms of rhythm shot and 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.200
 what is going well well above but 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.020
 it seems that it is not me I would compare it with 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.610
 royce then on the left I have a 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.980
 player that maybe many of you know him 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.390
 as maybe some do not and so on 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.310
 some the beams of this equipment do not 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:11.390
 you can is a player that I liked 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:13.670
 a lot has 80 and 88 65 pace shot 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:17.150
 and 35 headbut but those techniques 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:19.100
 they are all shot and cancer the 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.960
 steps are safer now explain 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.360
 it's because the rhythm itself is true that 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.060
 with 88 are very fast but look at the 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.220
 height is a player who has a 91 and 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.660
 with that you can see that 75 kansas is not going 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.130
 to have because how did a side 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.140
 a short defense because he is going to eat it 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.700
 the select one with a high then very 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.050
 possibly also eat it not 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.850
 It is also left-handed that if you get in 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.470
 diagonal because it can kick very well with 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.590
 the very good shoots very well with the 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.420
 left and then that's why the 52 is 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.880
 pretty lie I would give it a shot 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:50.030
 comparable to that of sven is a player who 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.530
 is very strong and very placed and I think 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.690
 which is the best silver right end 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.670
 of all of every last team of 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.040
 Germany 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.830
 and then in the front I have am the 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.660
 her beast of last 13 and this 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.640
 year maybe I like it a little less but 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.820
 even so an equal player appeared to me 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:11.170
 good young himself and 190 with 84 shooting 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:13.720
 77 the rhythm of forgiveness with 84 of rhythms 767 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.340
 shot that always gave me the 71 of 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.500
 headbutts I think your tests and here 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.540
 is it so 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:23.240
 enough is what you put 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.280
 true with what you feel except the 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:29.120
 shot I think your shot is 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.740
 by 70 and a lot even 80 because like the 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.630
 hook well increase a zambombazo 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.060
 that the goalie will not be able to smell the 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.610
 because kick is very very strong and then 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.990
 they measure about 90 71 degrees maybe and I 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.700
 I have not tried much above 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.290
 although I wanted to try because as is the 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.480
 training is made to test it with 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.639
 but I think that in this 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.980
 formation and of German silver me lapa 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:50.900
 is the best or one of the best without 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.160
 no doubt and good as is a team 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.930
 very complete that I encourage you to what 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.790
 prove is a team that is going to 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.770
 work very well you will perform very well 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.710
 well tell you that I the goals that you 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:03.470
 continuation the players in league is 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:07.040
 say in seasons in division 23 in 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:08.690
 first one because I could not get there but 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.400
 good for you to see 2 - the level against 

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.840
 I was playing and nothing left you 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.000
 a few goals for you to enjoy 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.560
 of this team and you can see with your 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.210
 own eyes what he is capable of doing 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.860
 so good you like the video not 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:21.229
