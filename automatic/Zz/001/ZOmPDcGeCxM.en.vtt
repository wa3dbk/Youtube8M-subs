00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:12.530
 good in this little video tutorial 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:15.830
 I want to show you how to get pieces 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.380
 for a Chinese mobile replica in this case 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.610
 for example we have here a replica of 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.180
 a galaxy s 5 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:27.380
 the replicas are on the outside exactly 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.470
 same as the originals 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.509
 but inside they are quite different 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:36.230
 and there is no replica of the s5 or a 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.120
 replica of note 3 but there is a 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.780
 lots of replicas of each of each 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.490
 model 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.060
 Thus 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:46.100
 without opening the mobile it is very difficult 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.820
 find a spare for these 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.520
 replicas because there are many different 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.860
 so in this case I have here 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:59.070
 disassembled a galaxy s 5 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.590
 here you can see the motherboard as I have 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.730
 said in each replica to finish are 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.040
 similar but not the same 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:11.410
 and I just want to show you here 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.410
 I have the touch and the lcd 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:19.440
 and I'm going to show you how to get the 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:21.630
 spare parts in this case 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.040
 of the touch lcd that are broken though 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.480
 you can also ask for things 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.430
 as the cargo port that is also 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.430
 It tends to break 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.600
 if you see in the port with the port of 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.909
 load 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.509
 the back is not going to 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.509
 appreciate very well 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.470
 but it has 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.990
 there is a small 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.720
 a small nomenclature 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.460
 that would be the reference of the piece that 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.790
 is what we should what we should 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.790
 ask 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.320
 in this case not only that puts it puts 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:06.659
 very small 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:09.869
 but 208 h 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.220
 h 0 I do not know what 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.890
 I do not see it from here but well that 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:18.269
 would be the nomenclature of the port of 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.340
 load if we go to the lcd it's always going to 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.860
 being in the back once is 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.319
 here on the sheet and most of the 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.970
 times the flex in this case we can see 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:31.910
 efe 500 1 406 vd 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.010
 this would be the flex code and this 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.930
 it would be the connector 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.150
 We can also fix the connector to the 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.470
 order the piece in this case 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.770
 is 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.280
 in the upper part to the right seen 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.280
 in front 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.900
 and here 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.269
 in him 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.549
 touch we always have to go to the 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:58.230
 top connector here has a 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.230
 small sticker that is the shortest 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.800
 OK 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.200
 well here in the tract and if we do not go to 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.790
 top where the connector 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.370
 we have to look at what is the 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.190
 connector 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.519
 we have it here and here also like 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.340
 that the other pieces we have a small 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.340
 nomenclature 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.120
 here is a little 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.120
 hidden 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.180
 and I would be going to see why this is the 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.180
 shit 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.050
 here we can see what would be 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:59.150
 the 1250 v 1.0 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.360
 other code other codes that we can 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.319
 see there's a uve of 273 and in this is the 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.780
 pin out 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.780
 of the connector is what each pin has 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.510
 is the identification of each pin that does not 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.640
 we need that we can ignore it 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:21.090
 important is the 1251 1.0 that would be the 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:24.889
 touch nomenclature 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.889
 and then then next to 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:38.099
 and other pieces of others 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:41.240
 of other mobiles also another that 5 what 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:41.240
 same we go to the connector 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.630
 and in this case it would be 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:57.930
 I would be good for back five thousand fpc 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:05:00.340
 037 of 01 that identification exit 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:04.360
 here I have 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:08.080
 another tactile of another 5 if you can see 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:13.129
 this these three are tactile 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:16.479
 of that 5 vouchers on the outside 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:16.479
 I'm going to put them in front 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.210
 ahead they are exactly the same as 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.250
 you can see 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:36.680
 and the connectors as you can see are 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.680
 totally different 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:43.510
 here is a clear example that every 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.510
 replica has a different connector 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:51.910
 and they have given I have other lcd for example 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:53.700
 these a lcd of 113 replica because here what 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:57.360
 we have 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:06:01.410
 the code on lcd xl 57 h of 00 other 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:04.010
 total or also in the flex from above 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:06.240
 but here I had to remove this 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.790
 black sticker that carries over there 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.480
 we can see the state fpc code that is 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.480
 the same one that comes down 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:19.080
 here we have one of s 4 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.080
 the same history 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.090
 it is decided 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:31.530
 and we have the code on the lcd and 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.530
 also in the flex from above 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:39.330
 fpc because whatever is usually 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:42.949
 start with fpc 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.949
 most of the time but not always 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.870
 and with this little tutorial, I've 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.090
 taught how 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:53.360
 order spare parts for your phones 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:56.800
 Chinese replica can be found in 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.800
 my online store 

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.550
 www.ceuta.es 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.550
 thanks for everything
