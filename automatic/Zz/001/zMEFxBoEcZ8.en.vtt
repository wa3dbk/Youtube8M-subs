00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.170
 We had Fernando Lara and he comes to sing 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.670
 you have a spectacular voice 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.180
 experience has voice has good 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.310
 presence is no secret that is 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.140
 one of the best singers he has 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.090
 because he has talent and if he's going to 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.310
 transmit to the public is a serious 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.250
 applicant for the final our thought 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:40.630
 that we can all win we all have the 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.630
 chance to win everything 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.280
 I think that talent goes beyond the 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.810
 objectives that the reality has but 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.030
 I consider what 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.800
 The situation of the 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.410
 public for sad home then 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.690
 this could also be a balance of what 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.730
 that could be touching public energetic 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.949
 he is simply voting with his heart 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.659
 is voting I think because of the story 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.659
 prettier is more than talent 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.950
 what can I tell you 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.880
 and respect the decision of the public I will 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.860
 do something super 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.290
 dynamic the subject goes 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.330
 I miss that begins the issue until 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.660
 finish because I am the guardian of 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.660
 talent 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.750
 I want to 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.240
 someone somebody a powerful person 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.950
 can you give me your hand and can you give me that 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.470
 joy to me and my family that both 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.470
 we suffer so that my girl is saved 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.000
 Like you from Manabi, said San Fernando 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.510
 It's a sweetie I'm given 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.550
 as a bird 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.350
 and I can not help it 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.170
 I move 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.320
 already 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.340
 do not take this away from me 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.780
 I have two with me 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.780
 it breaks my heart 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.350
 Y 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.970
 I will call 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.670
 this and I will be 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.190
 when I heat 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.500
 not only be alone 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.360
 but gentlemen 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:08.650
 our investments the truth is that 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:12.060
 there we have two of the four judges 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:15.569
 paid for you applauding you 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.930

 music is my life and I feel very happy 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.910
 I feel super powerful tonight and 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.100
 I really thank all the audience that 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.750
 He has supported me with his screams with his 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.210
 applause 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:37.639
 with their bikes 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.639

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:46.969
 the judges master fernando 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.900
 the wonderful one 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:51.940
 I think I have opposite 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.840
 to one of the possible winners of 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.840
 Ecuador has talent 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.370
 I always heard, I listen to you so 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.430
 more to 105 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.040
 wendy 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.780
 fernando thing unquestionably you have 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.180
 a voice that is not a common voice is a 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.370
 prodigy but I do not know if the issues that 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.080
 you selected tonight were what 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.790
 enough to get there remember 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.350
 that regardless of singing well 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.830
 because it already does have to 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.409
 transmit and I do not know if you did it good 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.699
 we 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:24.699
 do not transmit me I'm sorry 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.190
 execute the judges to the public too 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.289
 surely hope we ask the 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:38.809
 lifetime 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.809

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.060

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.860
 listen always I always said it and 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.270
 they know all my colleagues know 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.450
 you another boy who is not there but that 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.520
 it's not the case you're my favorite if 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.860
 you mentioned something that is here 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.470
 voting with history if it's true but 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.950
 you have history because you have something 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:03.350
 powerful behind you that is helping your 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:06.200
 daughter who is finding that person very 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.750
 powerful that will help you solve those 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:12.230
 problems and I know I think the bus that the 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:14.540
 people who are in their homes 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:17.660
 that you have both, you have 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:20.210
 an extraordinary talent and I know that you 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.190
 get out of here so do not win or win you go 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.810
 to give a lot to talk about in fact I 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.510
 I'm proud that you are 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:29.110
 Ecuador because you are an artist so 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.110
 But look 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.400
 I'm just getting him but that 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.600
 that the angles for order between with 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.650
 an artist 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.990

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.950
 good 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.720
 talking to the back we put a 

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:00.030
 little technical I know that you know that 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.980
 you can not your best presentations 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:04.400
 feels exquisite in the technical part 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.400
 vocal 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.590
 in some failures out there 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.380
 but all 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:17.060
