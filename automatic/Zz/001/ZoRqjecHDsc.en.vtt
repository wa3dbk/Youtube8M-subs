00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
little bit of volume another idea would

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.110 
little bit of volume another idea would
be<00:02:43.349> to<00:02:43.620> tease<00:02:43.920> your<00:02:44.099> hair<00:02:44.129> but<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:44.730> find<00:02:45.030> that

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
be to tease your hair but I find that

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.670 
be to tease your hair but I find that
that's<00:02:45.359> a<00:02:45.510> little<00:02:45.810> bit<00:02:45.930> too<00:02:46.079> difficult<00:02:46.560> to

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
that's a little bit too difficult to

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.440 
that's a little bit too difficult to
detangle<00:02:47.010> so<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:47.340> offer<00:02:47.639> this<00:02:47.910> alternative

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
detangle so I offer this alternative

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.759 
detangle so I offer this alternative

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
and may look difficult but with practice

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.559

know how to do a normal braid you just

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.099 
know how to do a normal braid you just
add<00:03:13.530> hair<00:03:13.859> to<00:03:13.889> each<00:03:14.099> strand<00:03:14.370> for<00:03:14.669> braiding

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
add hair to each strand for braiding

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.569 
add hair to each strand for braiding
when<00:03:16.109> doing<00:03:16.380> this<00:03:16.470> French<00:03:16.769> braid<00:03:17.040> don't<00:03:17.370> pull

when doing this French braid don't pull

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.129 
when doing this French braid don't pull
the<00:03:17.700> Strand<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.120> there's<00:03:18.389> super<00:03:18.720> tight<00:03:18.930> clear

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
the Strand so there's super tight clear

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:22.069 
the Strand so there's super tight clear
scalp<00:03:19.410> but<00:03:19.889> instead<00:03:20.280> pull<00:03:20.910> up<00:03:21.180> this<00:03:21.810> will<00:03:21.989> help

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
scalp but instead pull up this will help

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.839 
scalp but instead pull up this will help
you<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.440> achieve<00:03:22.560> a<00:03:22.889> loser<00:03:23.280> Bray<00:03:23.459> that<00:03:23.639> I'll<00:03:23.700> be

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
you to achieve a loser Bray that I'll be

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:28.730 
you to achieve a loser Bray that I'll be
easier<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.239> work<00:03:24.540> with<00:03:24.599> later

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.560 

I<00:03:28.830> also<00:03:29.400> think<00:03:29.670> that<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.910> braid<00:03:30.090> looks<00:03:30.210> a<00:03:30.390> lot

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
I also think that the braid looks a lot

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.420 
I also think that the braid looks a lot
nicer<00:03:30.630> if<00:03:31.080> you<00:03:31.110> add<00:03:31.320> thin<00:03:31.590> section<00:03:31.980> of<00:03:32.130> carrot

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
nicer if you add thin section of carrot

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.920 
nicer if you add thin section of carrot
from<00:03:32.520> the<00:03:32.610> front<00:03:32.970> of<00:03:33.030> your<00:03:33.180> head<00:03:33.360> instead<00:03:33.750> of

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
from the front of your head instead of

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.020 
from the front of your head instead of
right<00:03:34.140> beside<00:03:34.620> where<00:03:35.460> you're<00:03:35.700> currently

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
right beside where you're currently

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:46.580 
right beside where you're currently
braiding<00:03:36.450> not<00:03:37.050> them<00:03:37.290> except

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.929 

once<00:03:47.590> you<00:03:47.709> get<00:03:47.860> to<00:03:47.890> the<00:03:48.189> back<00:03:48.400> of<00:03:48.430> your<00:03:48.760> head

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:48.939 
once you get to the back of your head

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:50.490 
once you get to the back of your head
right<00:03:49.209> a<00:03:49.269> few<00:03:49.540> strands<00:03:49.870> normally<00:03:50.319> without
