transom mounted the motor through bolted
it<00:01:06.070> you<00:01:07.030> can<00:01:07.210> see<00:01:07.420> I'm<00:01:07.630> just<00:01:07.960> tearing<00:01:08.619> the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
it you can see I'm just tearing the

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.789

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
but that's the way it is I built the

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.190 
but that's the way it is I built the
center<00:01:14.920> console<00:01:15.430> to<00:01:15.909> match<00:01:16.150> I<00:01:16.480> just<00:01:16.690> pretty

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
center console to match I just pretty

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.080 
center console to match I just pretty
much<00:01:17.410> went<00:01:17.620> in<00:01:17.800> there<00:01:17.950> when<00:01:18.130> I<00:01:18.280> what<00:01:18.760> do<00:01:18.820> I<00:01:18.850> have

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
much went in there when I what do I have

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.650 
much went in there when I what do I have
here<00:01:19.330> cuz<00:01:19.570> I<00:01:19.630> like<00:01:19.810> that<00:01:20.050> one<00:01:20.260> and<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:22.390> I<00:01:22.420> built

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
here cuz I like that one and so I built

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.420 
here cuz I like that one and so I built
this<00:01:22.870> one<00:01:23.080> to<00:01:23.200> match<00:01:23.410> I<00:01:23.830> mean<00:01:24.100> it's<00:01:24.250> identical

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
this one to match I mean it's identical

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.310 
this one to match I mean it's identical
that's<00:01:27.430> got<00:01:27.760> a<00:01:27.790> better<00:01:28.060> electrical<00:01:28.750> system<00:01:29.140> in

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
that's got a better electrical system in

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.240 
that's got a better electrical system in
it<00:01:29.440> than<00:01:29.620> this<00:01:29.800> will<00:01:30.100> I<00:01:30.659> did<00:01:31.659> not<00:01:32.159> spend<00:01:33.159> the

plywood on top mounted up I already

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.850 
plywood on top mounted up I already
checked<00:04:07.730> it<00:04:07.970> makes<00:04:08.209> it<00:04:08.450> now<00:04:08.870> the<00:04:08.930> issue<00:04:09.320> is

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.390 

looking<00:04:12.860> at<00:04:13.070> my<00:04:13.340> trailer<00:04:14.030> here<00:04:14.739> I'm<00:04:15.739> thinking

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
looking at my trailer here I'm thinking

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.699 
looking at my trailer here I'm thinking
that<00:04:16.579> when<00:04:16.789> I'm<00:04:16.970> in<00:04:17.000> the<00:04:17.390> water<00:04:17.720> with<00:04:18.560> the

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
that when I'm in the water with the

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.029 
that when I'm in the water with the
trailer<00:04:19.250> I'm<00:04:19.489> going<00:04:19.880> to<00:04:19.940> hit<00:04:20.150> it<00:04:20.799> right<00:04:21.799> in

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
trailer I'm going to hit it right in

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.630 
trailer I'm going to hit it right in
there

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
there

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:28.990 
there
I<00:04:24.250> made<00:04:25.250> up<00:04:25.520> a<00:04:25.640> bracket<00:04:26.210> to<00:04:27.669> mount<00:04:28.669> this

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
I made up a bracket to mount this

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.659 
I made up a bracket to mount this
bracket<00:04:29.270> higher<00:04:29.900> so<00:04:30.710> it<00:04:30.919> would<00:04:31.070> carry<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.520> way

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
bracket higher so it would carry the way

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.629 
bracket higher so it would carry the way
to<00:04:31.729> the<00:04:31.970> front<00:04:32.210> of<00:04:32.300> the<00:04:32.390> boat

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
to the front of the boat

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:41.080 

if<00:04:35.000> I<00:04:35.330> raise<00:04:35.629> the<00:04:35.689> trailer<00:04:36.909> bunks<00:04:37.909> I<00:04:39.909> will<00:04:40.909> have

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
if I raise the trailer bunks I will have

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.939 
if I raise the trailer bunks I will have
to<00:04:41.300> raise<00:04:41.539> this<00:04:41.780> up<00:04:42.080> which<00:04:42.319> means<00:04:42.560> I<00:04:42.770> have<00:04:42.889> to

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
to raise this up which means I have to

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.219 
to raise this up which means I have to
make<00:04:43.159> a<00:04:43.189> full<00:04:43.490> bracket<00:04:44.000> and<00:04:44.150> all<00:04:44.360> rest<00:04:44.780> on<00:04:45.020> this

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
make a full bracket and all rest on this

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.089 
make a full bracket and all rest on this
I've<00:04:45.889> decided<00:04:46.400> not<00:04:46.759> to<00:04:46.819> do<00:04:47.270> that<00:04:47.680> they<00:04:48.680> gave<00:04:48.949> me

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:43.599 
the way I am and I cut it out using a

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:48.249 
the way I am and I cut it out using a
circular<00:05:44.599> saw<00:05:45.080> and<00:05:45.110> composite<00:05:45.919> blade<00:05:47.259> it's

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:48.259 
circular saw and composite blade it's

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:56.350 
circular saw and composite blade it's
heavy<00:05:48.879> and<00:05:49.879> I<00:05:52.389> fit<00:05:53.389> it<00:05:53.539> in<00:05:53.690> here<00:05:55.180> welded<00:05:56.180> these

tabs<00:05:56.719> on<00:05:57.080> to<00:05:57.349> it<00:05:57.500> so<00:05:57.680> I<00:05:57.740> could<00:05:57.919> bolt<00:05:58.159> through

00:05:59.519 --> 00:05:59.529 
tabs on to it so I could bolt through

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:02.260

feels<00:06:00.529> like<00:06:00.740> it's<00:06:00.949> going<00:06:01.099> to<00:06:01.129> work<00:06:01.370> because<00:06:01.969> I

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
feels like it's going to work because I

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.180 
feels like it's going to work because I
don't<00:06:02.330> have<00:06:02.569> it<00:06:02.629> set<00:06:03.020> right<00:06:03.050> right<00:06:03.919> about
