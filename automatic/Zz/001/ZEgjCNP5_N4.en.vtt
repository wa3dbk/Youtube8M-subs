00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
thinking about one of the first things I

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.649 
thinking about one of the first things I
did<00:01:25.200> was<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> Natural<00:01:25.950> History<00:01:25.979> Museum<00:01:26.479> it<00:01:27.479> was

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
did was a Natural History Museum it was

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.090 
did was a Natural History Museum it was
a<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:28.049> was<00:01:28.140> kind<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.380> interesting<00:01:28.590> approach

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
a it was kind of interesting approach

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.520 
a it was kind of interesting approach
because<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.400> was<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.759> diorama<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.840> diorama<00:01:31.229> of

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
because it was a diorama of a diorama of

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.780 
because it was a diorama of a diorama of
a<00:01:31.619> museum<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.250> thought<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.520> was<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.640> little

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
a museum so I thought that was a little

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.660 
a museum so I thought that was a little
bit<00:01:32.970> fun<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.630> work<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.380> way<00:01:34.530> I've<00:01:35.250> also<00:01:35.400> done

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
bit fun to work that way I've also done

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.450 
bit fun to work that way I've also done
a

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
a

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.670 
a
so<00:01:38.000> it<00:01:38.180> was<00:01:38.299> something<00:01:38.720> kind<00:01:39.110> of<00:01:39.170> like<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.500> met

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
so it was something kind of like the met

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.590 
so it was something kind of like the met
where<00:01:40.369> the<00:01:40.700> paintings<00:01:41.090> are<00:01:41.210> still<00:01:41.299> on<00:01:41.509> the

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
where the paintings are still on the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.109 
where the paintings are still on the
walls<00:01:41.810> but<00:01:42.590> animals<00:01:43.369> and<00:01:43.640> insects<00:01:43.939> had

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
walls but animals and insects had

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.120 
walls but animals and insects had

started taking back over the space so it

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.130 
started taking back over the space so it
became<00:01:46.430> a<00:01:47.200> place<00:01:48.200> for<00:01:48.259> bees<00:01:49.220> to<00:01:49.880> thrive<00:01:50.420> so<00:01:50.840> in

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
became a place for bees to thrive so in

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.139

think is going to be the viewers point
of<00:02:42.109> view<00:02:42.230> because<00:02:42.410> I<00:02:42.440> like<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.709> viewer<00:02:42.950> to

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
of view because I like the viewer to

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.310 
of view because I like the viewer to
place<00:02:43.970> themselves<00:02:44.180> in<00:02:44.510> these<00:02:44.660> scenes<00:02:44.989> and
