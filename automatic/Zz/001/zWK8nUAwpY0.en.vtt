00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
better as a year went on and certainly

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.230

the<00:00:27.390> stretch<00:00:27.740> he<00:00:28.740> used<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.160> body<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.640> work

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
the stretch he used that body of work

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.550 
the stretch he used that body of work
and<00:00:30.090> got<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> lot<00:00:30.539> better<00:00:30.750> before<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.349> ballgame

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
and got a lot better before the ballgame

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.620 
and got a lot better before the ballgame
he<00:00:31.980> really<00:00:32.279> had<00:00:32.430> his<00:00:32.610> best<00:00:32.850> game<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.120> year<00:00:33.390> was

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
he really had his best game of year was

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.990 
he really had his best game of year was
in<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.899> bowl<00:00:34.110> game<00:00:34.460> so<00:00:35.460> now<00:00:35.610> he's<00:00:35.820> got

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
in the bowl game so now he's got

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.910 
in the bowl game so now he's got
something<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.510> fall<00:00:36.690> back<00:00:36.750> on<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.469> look<00:00:37.710> at

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
something to fall back on to look at

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.470 
something to fall back on to look at
which<00:00:38.219> he's<00:00:38.399> done<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.670> lot<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:38.969> work<00:00:39.180> out<00:00:39.450> i

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
which he's done a lot of work out i

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.780 
which he's done a lot of work out i
think<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:40.500> know<00:00:40.530> spring<00:00:40.860> practice<00:00:41.340> went<00:00:41.579> back

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
think you know spring practice went back

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.340 
think you know spring practice went back
to<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> lot<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.300> fundamentals<00:00:42.930> because<00:00:43.020> you

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
to a lot of fundamentals because you

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.810 
to a lot of fundamentals because you
know<00:00:43.500> playing<00:00:43.770> quarterback<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.460> get<00:00:44.640> so

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
know playing quarterback you get so

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.279 
know playing quarterback you get so
caught<00:00:45.059> up<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.510> ex<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.840> Oh's<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:45.989> all

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
caught up in the ex and Oh's and all

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.139 
caught up in the ex and Oh's and all
these<00:00:46.410> other<00:00:46.469> things<00:00:46.920> sometimes<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:47.969> gets

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
these other things sometimes that gets

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.420 
these other things sometimes that gets
pushed<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.899> side<00:00:49.170> but<00:00:49.500> once<00:00:50.070> you're<00:00:50.250> more

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
pushed to the side but once you're more

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.459 
pushed to the side but once you're more
comfortable<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.329> game<00:00:51.510> slows<00:00:51.840> down<00:00:52.140> you

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
comfortable and the game slows down you

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.080 
comfortable and the game slows down you
go<00:00:52.620> back<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.890> those<00:00:53.129> fundamentals<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:53.940> get

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
go back to those fundamentals and get

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.240 
go back to those fundamentals and get
better<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.449> i<00:00:54.480> think<00:00:54.510> that's<00:00:54.930> what<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:56.160> know

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
better and i think that's what you know

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.369 
better and i think that's what you know
i<00:00:56.309> didn't<00:00:57.000> get<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.120> talk<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.570> him<00:00:57.690> much<00:00:57.930> just

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
i didn't get to talk to him much just

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.389 
i didn't get to talk to him much just

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
he did seem like the game he thought the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.179 
he did seem like the game he thought the
game<00:01:18.810> was<00:01:19.020> going<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.259> slow<00:01:19.500> down<00:01:19.740> for<00:01:20.070> him

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
together it worked out together can

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.880 
together it worked out together can
and<00:01:58.560> get<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.280> little<00:02:00.000> special<00:02:00.360> bond<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.260> you

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
and get a little special bond so you

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.650 
and get a little special bond so you
know<00:02:01.950> that's<00:02:02.100> something<00:02:02.400> that<00:02:02.640> we<00:02:03.270> have<00:02:03.480> to

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
know that's something that we have to

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.450 
know that's something that we have to
work<00:02:03.870> on<00:02:04.110> but<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.380> think<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:05.250> know<00:02:05.340> the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
work on but I think you know the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.100 
work on but I think you know the
redeeming<00:02:05.760> factor<00:02:06.330> is<00:02:06.480> I<00:02:06.600> think<00:02:06.660> we've<00:02:06.900> got

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
redeeming factor is I think we've got

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.020 
redeeming factor is I think we've got
experience<00:02:07.470> in<00:02:07.770> those<00:02:07.950> guys<00:02:08.160> up<00:02:08.430> front<00:02:08.759> so

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
experience in those guys up front so

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.120 
experience in those guys up front so
that<00:02:09.060> we<00:02:09.690> can<00:02:09.869> keep<00:02:10.050> him<00:02:10.229> upright<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.830> we<00:02:10.920> can

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
that we can keep him upright so we can

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.820 
that we can keep him upright so we can
throw<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.490> ball<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:12.590> defensive<00:02:13.590> side<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.740> the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
throw the ball a defensive side of the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.440 
throw the ball a defensive side of the
ball<00:02:13.890> obviously<00:02:14.580> you've<00:02:14.670> got<00:02:14.790> some<00:02:15.000> veterans

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
ball obviously you've got some veterans

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.210 
ball obviously you've got some veterans
up<00:02:15.630> front<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.050> you've<00:02:16.380> got<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.590> secondary<00:02:17.010> this

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
up front and you've got a secondary this

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.500 
up front and you've got a secondary this
ball-hawking<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:17.850> guys<00:02:17.970> feel<00:02:18.150> like<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.390> can

yeah but I think it's going to come to
the<00:02:22.410> front<00:02:22.530> for<00:02:22.890> i<00:02:23.070> mean<00:02:23.160> if<00:02:23.370> we<00:02:23.490> can<00:02:23.610> get<00:02:23.730> some

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
the front for i mean if we can get some

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.310 
the front for i mean if we can get some
pressure<00:02:24.180> on<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.450> quarterback<00:02:24.630> that<00:02:25.170> always

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
pressure on the quarterback that always

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.080 
pressure on the quarterback that always
makes<00:02:25.620> those<00:02:25.770> guys<00:02:26.010> in<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.280> secondary<00:02:26.760> better

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
makes those guys in the secondary better

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.080 
makes those guys in the secondary better
