00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
hey guys I recently picked up the

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.099 
hey guys I recently picked up the
mineralized<00:00:20.699> squad<00:00:21.029> from<00:00:21.270> Mac<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.750> harvest

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
mineralized squad from Mac and a harvest

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.349 
mineralized squad from Mac and a harvest
of<00:00:22.260> greens<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:22.980> am<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.490> in<00:00:23.670> love<00:00:23.699> with<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.180> so

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
of greens and I am so in love with it so

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.599 
of greens and I am so in love with it so
I<00:00:24.390> thought<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.660> would<00:00:24.869> do<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.019> tutorial<00:00:25.580> so<00:00:26.580> I

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
I thought I would do a tutorial so I

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.820 
I thought I would do a tutorial so I
went<00:00:26.939> ahead<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.269> primed<00:00:27.599> my<00:00:27.900> lids<00:00:28.199> with<00:00:28.529> soft

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
went ahead and primed my lids with soft

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.359 
went ahead and primed my lids with soft
ochre<00:00:29.189> which<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.519> just<00:00:29.730> neutral<00:00:30.330> yellow<00:00:30.900> base

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
ochre which is just neutral yellow base

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.600 
ochre which is just neutral yellow base
and<00:00:32.369> I'm<00:00:32.550> taking<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.450> nice<00:00:33.960> brown<00:00:34.579> shade<00:00:35.579> and

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
and I'm taking that nice brown shade and

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.850 
and I'm taking that nice brown shade and
putting<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.300> my<00:00:36.329> crease<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:37.140> really<00:00:37.680> like

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
putting that in my crease I really like

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.229 
putting that in my crease I really like
this<00:00:38.040> shade<00:00:38.219> because<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.520> has<00:00:38.670> just<00:00:38.700> enough

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
this shade because it has just enough

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.319 
this shade because it has just enough
amount<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.079> taupe<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:41.160> brown<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.120> gives

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
amount of taupe in the brown so it gives

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.229 
amount of taupe in the brown so it gives
you<00:00:42.480> some<00:00:42.750> really<00:00:42.780> nice<00:00:43.170> depth<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:45.059> crease

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
you some really nice depth in the crease

00:00:45.239 --> 00:01:00.160 
you some really nice depth in the crease
of<00:00:45.270> your<00:00:45.420> eye

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.770 

once<00:01:01.040> I<00:01:01.190> blended<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:01.730> taupey<00:01:02.059> brown<00:01:02.090> into<00:01:02.660> the

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
once I blended the taupey brown into the

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.780 
once I blended the taupey brown into the
crease<00:01:03.050> I'm<00:01:03.380> going<00:01:03.770> to<00:01:03.890> take<00:01:04.100> a<00:01:04.129> flat<00:01:04.460> shader

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
crease I'm going to take a flat shader

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.149 
crease I'm going to take a flat shader
brush<00:01:04.879> and<00:01:05.269> take<00:01:05.420> that<00:01:05.570> green<00:01:05.900> color<00:01:06.229> and<00:01:06.500> I'm

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
brush and take that green color and I'm

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:08.890 
brush and take that green color and I'm
going<00:01:07.490> to<00:01:07.520> take<00:01:07.850> this<00:01:08.000> all<00:01:08.270> over<00:01:08.570> the<00:01:08.780> lid

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
going to take this all over the lid

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.980 
going to take this all over the lid
without<00:01:09.680> going<00:01:10.010> above<00:01:10.130> the<00:01:10.400> crease<00:01:10.909> if<00:01:11.840> you

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
without going above the crease if you

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.310 
without going above the crease if you
notice<00:01:12.260> I'm<00:01:12.470> patting<00:01:12.830> and<00:01:13.190> then<00:01:13.369> very<00:01:14.320> lightly

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
notice I'm patting and then very lightly

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.770 
notice I'm patting and then very lightly
rubbing<00:01:16.010> this<00:01:16.580> back<00:01:16.820> and<00:01:17.030> forth<00:01:17.270> so<00:01:17.509> I<00:01:17.540> get<00:01:17.750> a

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
rubbing this back and forth so I get a

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.350 
rubbing this back and forth so I get a
consistent<00:01:18.560> amount<00:01:18.890> of<00:01:19.250> color<00:01:19.520> then<00:01:20.270> I'm

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
consistent amount of color then I'm

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.150 
consistent amount of color then I'm
taking<00:01:20.540> that<00:01:20.840> same<00:01:21.050> blending<00:01:21.470> brush<00:01:21.710> with<00:01:21.920> no

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
taking that same blending brush with no

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.040 
taking that same blending brush with no
additional<00:01:22.909> product<00:01:23.360> and<00:01:23.570> I'm<00:01:23.659> just<00:01:23.900> going<00:01:24.020> to

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
additional product and I'm just going to

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.340 
additional product and I'm just going to
blend<00:01:24.259> out<00:01:24.470> those<00:01:24.680> fine<00:01:24.950> edges<00:01:26.110> so<00:01:27.110> now<00:01:27.229> I'm

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
blend out those fine edges so now I'm

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.840 
blend out those fine edges so now I'm
taking<00:01:27.650> a<00:01:27.740> small<00:01:27.979> shader<00:01:28.250> brush<00:01:28.400> that's

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
taking a small shader brush that's

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.730 
taking a small shader brush that's
pretty<00:01:29.300> densely<00:01:29.720> packed<00:01:30.020> and<00:01:30.320> I'm<00:01:30.409> taking

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
pretty densely packed and I'm taking

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.770 
pretty densely packed and I'm taking
that<00:01:30.830> green<00:01:31.130> shade<00:01:31.369> again<00:01:31.700> and<00:01:32.000> I'm<00:01:32.420> taking

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
that green shade again and I'm taking

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.070 
that green shade again and I'm taking
this<00:01:32.990> in<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:33.979> lower<00:01:34.190> lash<00:01:34.820> line<00:01:35.180> just<00:01:35.899> for

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
this in the lower lash line just for

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.830 
this in the lower lash line just for
some<00:01:36.289> pop<00:01:36.500> of<00:01:36.710> color<00:01:36.920> I'm<00:01:37.430> then<00:01:38.390> taking<00:01:38.810> that

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
some pop of color I'm then taking that

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.600 
some pop of color I'm then taking that
shader<00:01:39.229> brush<00:01:39.320> and<00:01:39.530> kind<00:01:39.770> of<00:01:39.920> winging<00:01:40.250> it<00:01:40.520> out

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
shader brush and kind of winging it out

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.639 
shader brush and kind of winging it out
to<00:01:41.060> give<00:01:41.210> myself<00:01:41.420> a<00:01:41.930> nice<00:01:42.110> little<00:01:42.170> guideline

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
to give myself a nice little guideline

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.260 
to give myself a nice little guideline
for<00:01:43.190> where<00:01:43.340> I'm<00:01:43.460> going<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:43.789> put<00:01:43.910> my<00:01:44.060> winged

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270

for where I'm going to put my winged
liner<00:01:44.509> and<00:01:44.899> just<00:01:45.440> so<00:01:45.530> I<00:01:45.560> have<00:01:45.830> that<00:01:46.039> really

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
liner and just so I have that really

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.779 
liner and just so I have that really
nice<00:01:46.580> elongated<00:01:47.410> kind<00:01:48.410> of<00:01:48.530> cat<00:01:48.830> eye<00:01:49.039> with<00:01:49.100> your

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
nice elongated kind of cat eye with your

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.510 
nice elongated kind of cat eye with your
eye<00:01:49.820> shadow<00:01:50.210> effect<00:01:50.929> I'm<00:01:51.740> also<00:01:51.920> just<00:01:52.220> kind<00:01:52.460> of

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
eye shadow effect I'm also just kind of

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.219 
eye shadow effect I'm also just kind of
patting<00:01:52.940> it<00:01:53.060> in<00:01:53.179> just<00:01:53.509> to<00:01:53.570> make<00:01:53.660> it<00:01:53.810> blend<00:01:54.140> a

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
patting it in just to make it blend a

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.279 
patting it in just to make it blend a
little<00:01:54.350> bit<00:01:54.590> more<00:01:54.770> easily<00:01:55.070> I'm<00:01:55.960> then<00:01:56.960> going<00:01:57.110> in

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
little bit more easily I'm then going in

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:58.630 
little bit more easily I'm then going in
with<00:01:57.410> the<00:01:57.500> darkest<00:01:57.860> shade<00:01:58.039> on<00:01:58.160> the<00:01:58.280> palette

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
with the darkest shade on the palette

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.630 
with the darkest shade on the palette
which<00:01:58.789> is<00:01:58.820> kind<00:01:59.210> of<00:01:59.330> like<00:01:59.509> a<00:01:59.539> maroon<00:01:59.990> e<00:02:00.110> purple

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
which is kind of like a maroon e purple

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.219 
which is kind of like a maroon e purple
it's<00:02:01.640> really<00:02:01.940> pretty<00:02:02.119> and<00:02:02.270> I'm<00:02:02.660> just<00:02:02.899> taking

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
it's really pretty and I'm just taking

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:04.810 
it's really pretty and I'm just taking
that<00:02:03.259> and<00:02:03.619> I'm<00:02:03.740> putting<00:02:03.979> this<00:02:04.189> in<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.369> outer<00:02:04.640> V

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
that and I'm putting this in the outer V

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.229 
that and I'm putting this in the outer V
I'm<00:02:05.770> initially<00:02:06.770> patting<00:02:07.280> and<00:02:07.520> then<00:02:07.790> kind<00:02:08.119> of

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
I'm initially patting and then kind of

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.660 
I'm initially patting and then kind of
sweeping<00:02:08.690> it<00:02:08.840> around<00:02:09.079> just<00:02:09.440> so<00:02:09.590> I<00:02:09.619> can<00:02:09.890> get<00:02:10.070> the

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
sweeping it around just so I can get the

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.150 
sweeping it around just so I can get the
most<00:02:10.940> color<00:02:11.420> in<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.900> outermost<00:02:12.470> part<00:02:12.890> of<00:02:12.980> my

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
most color in the outermost part of my

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.640 
most color in the outermost part of my
eye<00:02:13.450> then<00:02:14.450> I'm<00:02:14.570> taking<00:02:14.720> that<00:02:14.989> same<00:02:15.049> blending

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
eye then I'm taking that same blending
