00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.020
 Hello 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.950
 first I want to show what I'm 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.670
 doing 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.070
 an original Victorian corset that counts 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.560
 with three forced layers between the 26 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.110
 flexible flexible steel rods to 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.189
 the sides what keeps it completely 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.140
 right is the bus or the button because 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.079
 this does not double as much as you want as 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.980
 you can see 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.780
 I bury that double are very 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.680
 resistant have a guarantee 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.980
 deformity 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.420
 you can 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.929
 to adjust with the laces with 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.929
 i was 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.130
 it is not a strip anybody is not a strip 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.080
 normal that they are going to break up with 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.350
 months of use that will stop them from 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.350
 stay 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.560
 for life and good besides that they are 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.150
 to gradually reduce the 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.610
 waist or as we call it 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.340
 training to reduce the box 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.119
 thoracic 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.340
 the waist ribs even serve 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.990
 also as postpartum strips to help 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.670
 to compress the ribs that are 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.670
 opened during pregnancy 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.910
 I have a corset under the bust that 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.500
 actually if they want it to use 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.910
 This is the most indicated diary since 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.090
 well, it 's easier to disguise if 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.140
 they want to wear inside clothes they do not 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.090
 note 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.979
 but they are so beautiful that 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.159
 can use as an undergarment and as 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:52.080
 outer garment 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:55.260
 Now this model is brocade coal 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:59.080
 chad and black with red is a size 20 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.270
 as you can see full 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.160
 some day to be able to close it I have gone 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.570
 moving forward a bit since I started 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.759
 use sewing but did not yet 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.020
 to completely close a stem 20 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:16.810
 They are 20 inches 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.970
 completely closed are 50 centimeters 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.630
 also about I do not know here as two 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:26.310
 inches is probably closed no 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.310
 It is usually 55 centimeters 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.000
 I have many questions usually like 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.090
 how to choose porcel unit 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.480
 the first thing to do 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.480
 is 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.970
 without anything you have to measure your waist in 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.530
 the narrowest area 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.530
 to identify 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.860
 It can be one or two fingers above the 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:03.540
 navel suppose that you measure yourself and 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.579
 natural measure is 24 inches 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.090
 according to our table of sizes I have 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:12.560
 available 10 sizes from size 20 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:16.220
 up to size 38 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.849
 so if my natural waist is 24 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.980
 inches I have to get off 3 inches 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:26.459
 this would take me to size 21 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:31.080
 but since it is not already 21 probably not 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:33.480
 comes by looks 20 22 24 26 28 30 and 34 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.010
 in is and 6 if we stay in a number 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.540
 odd you have to go down 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.210
 then the corset that I have to 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:43.010
 ask to be already 20 that is an example 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.439
 now I have available 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.079
 about 200 models almost all the 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:50.450
 works on the order but I here in 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:52.879
 Mexico in existence I try to have the 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.319

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.830
 in very colors 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:19.850

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.850

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.280
 in black 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.360
 really black or red whites are the 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.060
 Most requested are available for 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.480
 Immediate delivery can I do 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.870
 shipments to any country in the world 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.449
 regularly 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.240
 the only thing I have 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:46.599
 check how much I get a little more in the 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.599
 shipping but always in less than 24 hours 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:51.810
 will have their code of 3 people 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:55.910
 that are from here of 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.910
 mexico federal district can come 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:04.340
 I take their measure myself and I 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.230
 I recommend that I tell them what size is the 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.240
 that they have to use and then 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:11.810
 we proceed to see that by sense 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.150
 they like 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.760
 this depends on the type of clothes that 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:20.770
 always use I usually am informed 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.770
 and I love denim 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.600
 good 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:53.710
 and good at that moment that's all 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.390
 Any questions or comments 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.220
 can you put it in the section of 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.890
 questions and answers or they can send 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.810
 an email I always answer them to 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.280
 Sometimes I do not have time to answer all 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.410
 the questions on youtube but the 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.140
 emails that I receive that always the 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.030
 contexts I can send the catalog of 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.340
 contact information for purchases 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.860
 international payments except for 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.240
 paypal 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.240
 also for your meeting 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.260
 for now that's all soon I'll go 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.560
 uploading more videos 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:27.510
 provide a little more information 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.190
 the use of the car 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.860
 and there are people who are afraid in 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.800
 reality there is no 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.629
 no risk to the arcs always and 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.669
 when you are careful you have to be 

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:40.580
 careful with the body always go 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:43.539
 squeezing little by little so that 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.539
 you never hurt anything 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:47.800
 and it's going to be a bit slower but 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.840
 always respecting the limits of your 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.600
 body if so much more the legs are taken 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.580
 the bars that are very tight if 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.310
 you hurt the ribs is that even you 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:59.830
 body is not prepared to 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:02.710
 endure that pressure to which he is 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:06.370
 submitting but if it is done being 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:08.440
 careful and squeezing little by little each 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:11.470
 once does not have to doubly anything and 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.780
 You are going to reduce your waist 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:17.040
 for now that's all I say goodbye 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.040
 I hope to continue 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:21.060
 I find that very difficult 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.500
 and goodbye
