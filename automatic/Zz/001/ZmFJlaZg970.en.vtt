00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 very good friends today we are going to talk about 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.850
 how to germinate medlar from seed 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.100
 a simple and very inexpensive way 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.230
 for this we will only need a few children 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.790
 dogs that we can acquire a center 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:18.060
 commercial or in any greengrocer 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.890
 some transparent phil water or 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.730
 Any plastic that will help us 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.400
 cover and a tupper without forgetting the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.800
 napkin in this case as you can see 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.989
 I have already eaten a medlar like see 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.750
 some seeds and it's very important 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:36.800
 stress that once you eat the 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.270
 medlar do not forget immediately 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.390
 plant the seeds or try to generate 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.600
 the as is my case because I'm going to get wet 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.880
 a little bit if they lose hydration 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:51.630
 its termination power is resected 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.770
 can reload lethargy and if this 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.870
 it happens then surely it does not come out 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.900
 and the process very simple as in other 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.770
 occasions we have taught in this channel 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.770
 we put our seeds 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:11.260
 in the napkin if we had more 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.860
 we put them in a row we throw 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.860
 abundant water 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.090
 as you can see soak 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.049
 but it will not come 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.049
 flooded 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.610
 we close here 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.610
 we close again 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.689
 and it seems that they are still a little pond 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:38.840
 because me about the last water 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:41.979
 remove and as inside the tupper I have 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.979
 another napkin 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.920
 he folded this napkin over 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.920
 and take the remainder 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.840
 good because now I have to put the fill 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.619
 transparent 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.179
 that we will put it here because this is going to 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.880
 achieve maintain a temperature 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.770
 constant surely inside the tupper 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.350
 raise the temperature what will help 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.259
 quite germination and on the other hand 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.700
 it will maintain the humidity that it already has and does not 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.850
 we have to be reviewing what 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.520
 constantly 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.020
 It is important to emphasize that within 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.450
 each to Medlar 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.360
 we can find from 2 to 3 seeds what 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.330
 normal so average would be two seeds 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.760
 and as I said nothing else to take them out 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.590
 the germination now I will put these and 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.830
 throw the transparent fill 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.860
 and we will see again how about in two or 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.130
 three weeks good friends have good 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.980
 after two weeks 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.260
 change the napkin I put some bones 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.460
 more in case the first ones failed 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:55.760
 everything from the same purchase 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.760
 and it has been a resounding success that you set 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.560
 you will see how all of them are absolutely 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.400
 the one that most even the least 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.400
 generated roots 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.959
 they are already looking for the land 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.959
 everyone has around here 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.290
 They are very long 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.299
 but be very careful because they are very 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.760
 delicate and you can leave with a lot 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.330
 ease unlike other species 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.100
 that can 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.910
 other classes can be handled fairly 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.430
 well these are very delicate 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.520
 and they stick in the napkin if we take 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.319
 too much time 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.870
 s 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.910
 everything is absolutely where it is 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.030
 good in host 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:44.190
 and this one here is also casting 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.319
 it seems that if one rots or dries 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.190
 new sprout as it has food 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.190
 inside the bone 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.350
 keep under tourÃ© gifts 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.390
 if I left them a week more surely 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.580
 we would start to see something green like the 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.650
 case of this 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:04.260
 if you look there starts to come out something 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.290
 and this experiment can be achieved 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.750
 germinate does not need stratification 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.120
 needs to 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.650
 break the bone or anything like that or 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.350
 simply with the napkin and 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.820
 maintaining optimum humidity has been 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.830
 got 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.320
 If you're gone, have the video of me 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:23.180
 like do not forget to subscribe to the channel if 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.900
 you have not done it yet and we'll see you in 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.900
