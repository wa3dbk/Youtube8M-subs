in<00:02:45.290> Belize<00:02:45.770> City<00:02:45.920> I<00:02:46.070> think<00:02:46.310> it's<00:02:46.430> a<00:02:46.550> meeting

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
in Belize City I think it's a meeting

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.400 
in Belize City I think it's a meeting
and<00:02:47.150> coming<00:02:47.510> up<00:02:48.250> you<00:02:49.250> know<00:02:49.370> I<00:02:49.400> think<00:02:50.410> almost

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
and coming up you know I think almost

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.460 
and coming up you know I think almost
reaching<00:02:52.100> Belmopan<00:02:52.760> there<00:02:53.570> is<00:02:53.720> some<00:02:53.959> potholes

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
reaching Belmopan there is some potholes

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.760 
reaching Belmopan there is some potholes

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
on the highway and I think one of the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.250 
on the highway and I think one of the
vehicles<00:02:58.160> trying<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:58.940> divert<00:02:59.540> from<00:02:59.720> that<00:02:59.989> and

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
vehicles trying to divert from that and

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.680 
vehicles trying to divert from that and
I'm<00:03:00.440> quite<00:03:00.620> sure<00:03:00.860> and<00:03:01.130> and<00:03:02.090> that's<00:03:02.480> that's

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
I'm quite sure and and that's that's

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:03.970 
I'm quite sure and and that's that's
what<00:03:02.900> cause<00:03:03.110> he<00:03:03.260> actually<00:03:03.500> not<00:03:03.680> quite<00:03:03.950> sure

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
what cause he actually not quite sure

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.890 
what cause he actually not quite sure
exactly<00:03:04.550> what's<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:05.030> situation<00:03:05.540> and<00:03:05.720> that

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
exactly what's the situation and that

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.420 
exactly what's the situation and that
but<00:03:06.200> I<00:03:06.320> know<00:03:06.410> that<00:03:06.860> that's<00:03:07.130> where<00:03:07.310> the

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.129 
which I think about is damaged we know
quite<00:04:10.249> sure<00:04:10.519> how<00:04:10.790> bad<00:04:11.030> but<00:04:11.419> they're

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
quite sure how bad but they're

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:14.890 
quite sure how bad but they're
diagnosing<00:04:12.829> that<00:04:12.950> at<00:04:13.159> this<00:04:13.310> time<00:04:13.750> so<00:04:14.750> I<00:04:14.780> think

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
diagnosing that at this time so I think

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.009 
diagnosing that at this time so I think
is<00:04:15.319> a<00:04:15.349> very<00:04:16.000> very<00:04:17.000> good<00:04:17.180> idea<00:04:17.269> to<00:04:17.449> take<00:04:17.690> her<00:04:17.870> to

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
is a very very good idea to take her to

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.289 
is a very very good idea to take her to
release<00:04:18.259> for<00:04:18.590> the<00:04:18.709> cat<00:04:18.889> scan<00:04:19.250> so<00:04:19.789> we<00:04:19.910> could<00:04:20.090> see

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
release for the cat scan so we could see

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.050 
release for the cat scan so we could see
the<00:04:20.570> further<00:04:20.810> injury<00:04:21.380> on<00:04:22.099> her<00:04:22.340> now<00:04:22.550> doing

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
the further injury on her now doing

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.930 
the further injury on her now doing
