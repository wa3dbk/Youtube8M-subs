gonna have to go around and let's scout
out<00:00:47.219> some<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.670> these<00:00:47.789> bases<00:00:48.710> we're<00:00:49.710> gonna<00:00:49.800> need

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
out some of these bases we're gonna need

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.910 
out some of these bases we're gonna need
to<00:00:50.070> find<00:00:50.160> some<00:00:51.050> this<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.199> gonna<00:00:52.320> be<00:00:52.410> ridiculous

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
to find some this is gonna be ridiculous

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.010 
to find some this is gonna be ridiculous
I<00:00:53.399> don't<00:00:53.430> even<00:00:53.670> know<00:00:53.910> how<00:00:54.180> I'm<00:00:54.449> going<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.809> do

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
I don't even know how I'm going to do

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.250 
I don't even know how I'm going to do
this<00:00:55.230> um<00:00:56.190> actually<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:57.210> guess<00:00:57.690> we're<00:00:57.870> gonna<00:00:57.960> try

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
this um actually I guess we're gonna try

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.660 
this um actually I guess we're gonna try
and<00:00:58.410> look<00:00:58.559> for<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.920> base<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.690> hopefully

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
and look for a base that hopefully

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.219 
and look for a base that hopefully
doesn't<00:01:02.670> have<00:01:02.910> too<00:01:03.120> many<00:01:03.149> mines<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.899> front

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
doesn't have too many mines in the front

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.450 
doesn't have too many mines in the front
and<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.530> maybe<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.860> can<00:01:05.990> maybe<00:01:06.990> if<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.470> figure

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
and that maybe I can maybe if I figure

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.880 
and that maybe I can maybe if I figure
out<00:01:08.549> how<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.790> use<00:01:09.119> my<00:01:09.360> nose<00:01:09.630> well<00:01:09.990> enough<00:01:10.320> I'm

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
out how to use my nose well enough I'm

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.440 
out how to use my nose well enough I'm
gonna<00:01:11.040> make<00:01:11.220> sure<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.610> guys<00:01:11.790> can<00:01:12.090> see

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
gonna make sure that you guys can see

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.980 
gonna make sure that you guys can see
this<00:01:12.920> if<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.189> figure<00:01:14.580> out<00:01:14.700> how<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.909> use<00:01:15.119> my<00:01:15.330> nose

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
this if I figure out how to use my nose

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.149 
this if I figure out how to use my nose
well<00:01:16.500> enough<00:01:16.860> then<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:18.030> can<00:01:18.240> try<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:19.229> flare

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
well enough then I can try and a flare

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.890 
well enough then I can try and a flare
all<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.640> them<00:01:20.880> back<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.020> back<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.680> base

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
all of them back to the back of the base

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.609 
all of them back to the back of the base
this<00:01:24.900> one<00:01:25.080> might<00:01:25.229> work<00:01:25.409> pretty<00:01:25.710> well<00:01:26.869> if<00:01:27.869> we

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
this one might work pretty well if we

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.230 
this one might work pretty well if we
can<00:01:28.799> flare<00:01:29.250> then<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:29.729> one's<00:01:29.939> going<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.150> be

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
can flare then this one's going to be

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.950 
can flare then this one's going to be
awesome<00:01:30.920> I'm<00:01:31.920> level<00:01:32.369> 31<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:33.060> guy's<00:01:33.270> level<00:01:33.600> 28

all right good so they're gonna go all
the<00:02:04.110> way<00:02:04.140> up<00:02:04.380> there<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:05.000> then<00:02:06.500> hopefully

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
the way up there and then hopefully

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.350 
the way up there and then hopefully
they're<00:02:07.950> gonna<00:02:08.069> make<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.670> this<00:02:09.119> base<00:02:09.330> is

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
they're gonna make it this base is

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.820 
they're gonna make it this base is
definitely<00:02:09.929> going<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.080> be<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.259> little<00:02:10.530> bit<00:02:10.679> too

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
definitely going to be a little bit too

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.410 
definitely going to be a little bit too
easy<00:02:11.069> if<00:02:11.310> if<00:02:11.580> these<00:02:12.239> flip<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.959> flares

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
easy if if these flip the flares

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.449 
easy if if these flip the flares
one<00:02:13.480> out<00:02:13.680> all<00:02:14.680> right<00:02:14.800> we<00:02:14.920> got<00:02:15.069> to<00:02:15.160> get<00:02:15.220> another

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
one out all right we got to get another

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.729 
one out all right we got to get another
one<00:02:15.580> up<00:02:15.730> there<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.180> need<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:16.930> use<00:02:17.110> a<00:02:17.140> heal<00:02:17.410> spell

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
one up there I need to use a heal spell

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.940 
one up there I need to use a heal spell
eyes<00:02:18.069> they're<00:02:18.310> going<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.489> take<00:02:18.730> it<00:02:18.880> out<00:02:19.950> the

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
eyes they're going to take it out the

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.620 
eyes they're going to take it out the
machine<00:02:21.280> guns<00:02:21.489> doing<00:02:21.790> some<00:02:21.940> serious<00:02:22.180> work<00:02:22.569> to

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
machine guns doing some serious work to

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.430 
machine guns doing some serious work to
them<00:02:22.989> let's<00:02:23.980> pick<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.489> other<00:02:24.760> flare<00:02:25.330> and<00:02:25.720> then

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
them let's pick the other flare and then

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.070 
them let's pick the other flare and then
I<00:02:27.310> guess<00:02:27.670> we<00:02:27.819> finally<00:02:28.030> here<00:02:28.690> let's<00:02:28.900> try<00:02:28.959> and

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
I guess we finally here let's try and

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.030 
I guess we finally here let's try and
make<00:02:29.170> this<00:02:29.230> a<00:02:29.290> little<00:02:29.349> more<00:02:29.470> interesting<00:02:29.709> okay

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
make this a little more interesting okay

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.740 
make this a little more interesting okay
we're<00:02:30.250> gonna<00:02:30.340> drop<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:30.700> heal<00:02:31.030> spell<00:02:31.390> right

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
we're gonna drop a heal spell right

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.350 
we're gonna drop a heal spell right
there<00:02:32.290> oh<00:02:32.680> no<00:02:33.100> I<00:02:33.130> drop<00:02:33.459> a<00:02:33.489> too<00:02:33.670> far<00:02:33.880> behind<00:02:34.030> them

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
there oh no I drop a too far behind them

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.979 
there oh no I drop a too far behind them
and<00:02:35.700> let's<00:02:36.700> use<00:02:37.569> the<00:02:37.900> let's<00:02:38.800> use<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.720> flare<00:02:40.720> up

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
and let's use the let's use the flare up

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.410 
and let's use the let's use the flare up
top<00:02:41.290> again<00:02:41.709> right<00:02:41.950> there<00:02:42.160> and<00:02:42.430> see<00:02:43.000> we<00:02:43.180> can<00:02:43.300> get

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
top again right there and see we can get

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.150 
top again right there and see we can get
them<00:02:43.569> back<00:02:43.750> here<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:44.110> mortar<00:02:44.440> is<00:02:44.620> doing<00:02:45.040> a

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
them back here the mortar is doing a

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.940 
them back here the mortar is doing a
pretty<00:02:45.340> good<00:02:45.430> amount<00:02:45.700> of<00:02:45.940> damage<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.569> them<00:02:46.989> um

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
pretty good amount of damage to them um

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.790 
pretty good amount of damage to them um
and<00:02:48.670> I<00:02:49.000> think<00:02:49.090> let's<00:02:49.690> just<00:02:49.870> go<00:02:49.989> ahead<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:50.260> use

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
and I think let's just go ahead and use

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.820 
and I think let's just go ahead and use
another<00:02:51.370> if<00:02:51.850> this<00:02:52.209> feels<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:52.780> weird<00:02:53.080> hitting

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
another if this feels so weird hitting

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.490 
another if this feels so weird hitting
my<00:02:53.950> nose<00:02:54.160> on<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.610> let's<00:02:55.120> do<00:02:55.630> this<00:02:55.870> with<00:02:56.110> a<00:02:56.170> shock

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
my nose on it let's do this with a shock

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.660 
my nose on it let's do this with a shock
bomb<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:57.190> shock<00:02:57.940> them<00:02:58.319> let's<00:02:59.319> can<00:03:00.040> i<00:03:00.130> scroll<00:03:00.489> I

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
bomb and shock them let's can i scroll I

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.580 
bomb and shock them let's can i scroll I
can<00:03:00.910> scroll<00:03:01.239> with<00:03:01.390> my<00:03:01.510> nose<00:03:01.690> too<00:03:01.959> and<00:03:02.230> then

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
can scroll with my nose too and then

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.130 
can scroll with my nose too and then
we're<00:03:02.680> gonna<00:03:02.799> scroll<00:03:03.130> and<00:03:03.459> then<00:03:03.610> there<00:03:04.140> we

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
we're gonna scroll and then there we

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.309 
we're gonna scroll and then there we
actually<00:03:05.620> got<00:03:05.860> it<00:03:06.069> done<00:03:06.400> um<00:03:06.819> I<00:03:07.780> thought<00:03:08.230> that

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
actually got it done um I thought that

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.400 
actually got it done um I thought that
was<00:03:08.470> gonna<00:03:08.560> be<00:03:08.680> a<00:03:08.799> lot<00:03:09.100> harder<00:03:09.630> but<00:03:10.630> thankfully

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
was gonna be a lot harder but thankfully

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.559 
was gonna be a lot harder but thankfully
I<00:03:11.440> just<00:03:11.680> found<00:03:11.830> a<00:03:12.040> pretty<00:03:12.250> easy<00:03:12.549> base<00:03:12.940> so

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
I just found a pretty easy base so

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.690 
I just found a pretty easy base so
here's<00:03:13.989> what<00:03:14.170> we're<00:03:14.260> gonna<00:03:14.380> do<00:03:14.620> okay<00:03:14.950> we're

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
here's what we're gonna do okay we're

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.380 
here's what we're gonna do okay we're
gonna<00:03:15.819> see<00:03:16.180> if<00:03:16.510> I<00:03:17.140> can<00:03:17.590> do<00:03:17.799> it<00:03:17.829> with<00:03:18.370> how<00:03:19.209> many

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
gonna see if I can do it with how many

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.410 
gonna see if I can do it with how many
did<00:03:19.510> we<00:03:19.540> lose<00:03:19.709> see<00:03:20.709> we<00:03:21.160> lost<00:03:21.370> 24<00:03:22.000> of<00:03:22.120> them<00:03:22.239> which

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
did we lose see we lost 24 of them which

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.940 
did we lose see we lost 24 of them which
is<00:03:22.450> actually<00:03:22.720> a<00:03:22.930> pretty<00:03:23.140> good<00:03:23.350> amount<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.769> lose

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
is actually a pretty good amount to lose

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.690 
is actually a pretty good amount to lose
so<00:03:24.010> we<00:03:24.730> definitely<00:03:24.970> completed<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:25.989> challenge

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
so we definitely completed the challenge

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.490 
so we definitely completed the challenge
let's<00:03:27.700> see<00:03:27.910> if<00:03:28.030> we<00:03:28.150> can<00:03:28.359> do<00:03:28.540> one<00:03:28.720> that<00:03:28.900> has<00:03:29.079> more

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
let's see if we can do one that has more

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.860 
let's see if we can do one that has more
of<00:03:29.799> the<00:03:30.160> defense's<00:03:30.880> around<00:03:31.120> it<00:03:31.510> here<00:03:31.690> let's

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
of the defense's around it here let's

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.140 
of the defense's around it here let's
see<00:03:31.989> we<00:03:32.109> can<00:03:32.230> do<00:03:32.350> this<00:03:32.470> one<00:03:32.650> even<00:03:32.920> well<00:03:33.790> let's

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
see we can do this one even well let's

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.259 
see we can do this one even well let's
go<00:03:34.269> back<00:03:34.450> and<00:03:34.950> since<00:03:35.950> that<00:03:36.130> level<00:03:36.519> 31<00:03:36.940> let's<00:03:37.120> go

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
go back and since that level 31 let's go

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.270 
go back and since that level 31 let's go
ahead<00:03:37.510> come<00:03:38.140> back<00:03:38.320> here<00:03:38.500> train<00:03:38.890> them<00:03:39.010> all<00:03:39.130> up

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
again finish them and then we're gonna

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.940 
again finish them and then we're gonna
go<00:03:42.160> over<00:03:42.280> here<00:03:42.430> to<00:03:42.910> this<00:03:43.690> level<00:03:43.959> 30<00:03:44.350> right<00:03:44.620> here

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950

go over here to this level 30 right here
and<00:03:45.130> we're<00:03:45.280> going<00:03:45.459> to<00:03:45.609> attack<00:03:46.209> it<00:03:46.420> and<00:03:46.450> let's

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
and we're going to attack it and let's

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.050 
and we're going to attack it and let's
see<00:03:46.900> how<00:03:47.140> we<00:03:47.200> can<00:03:47.470> do<00:03:47.680> on<00:03:47.980> something<00:03:48.850> like<00:03:49.000> this

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
see how we can do on something like this

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.270 
see how we can do on something like this
um<00:03:51.120> yes<00:03:52.120> he's<00:03:52.480> got<00:03:52.709> flamethrowers<00:03:53.709> and<00:03:54.010> all

lose<00:05:39.430> but<00:05:39.460> they<00:05:39.760> have<00:05:39.880> fun<00:05:40.090> while<00:05:40.270> you're

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
lose but they have fun while you're

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.790 
lose but they have fun while you're
doing<00:05:40.419> it<00:05:40.690> and<00:05:40.810> that<00:05:40.990> was<00:05:41.050> fun<00:05:41.320> even<00:05:41.530> though

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
doing it and that was fun even though

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.950 
doing it and that was fun even though
base<00:05:42.040> might<00:05:42.280> have<00:05:42.370> been<00:05:42.460> a<00:05:42.490> little<00:05:42.580> easy<00:05:42.960> but

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
base might have been a little easy but

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.540 
base might have been a little easy but
