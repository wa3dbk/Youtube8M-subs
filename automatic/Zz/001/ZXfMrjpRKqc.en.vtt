00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.490 
can see it's only a little crater but
these<00:03:40.360> are<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:40.570> bigger<00:03:40.750> there's<00:03:41.110> bigger<00:03:41.290> ones

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500

on<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.770> airfield<00:03:44.340> glad<00:03:45.340> that<00:03:45.460> here<00:03:45.610> here<00:03:45.820> and

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
on the airfield glad that here here and

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.610 
on the airfield glad that here here and
not<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.270> tower<00:03:49.110> so<00:03:50.110> that's<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:50.350> airfield

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
not the tower so that's the airfield

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.320 
not the tower so that's the airfield
inspection<00:03:51.100> complete<00:03:51.430> it<00:03:51.580> took<00:03:51.760> about<00:03:51.850> 40

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
inspection complete it took about 40

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
inspection complete it took about 40
minutes<00:03:52.480> so<00:03:52.780> we've<00:03:52.930> checked<00:03:53.080> all<00:03:53.230> the

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
minutes so we've checked all the

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.830 
minutes so we've checked all the
surfaces<00:03:53.890> and<00:03:54.160> I'm<00:03:54.520> absolutely<00:03:54.880> roasting

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
surfaces and I'm absolutely roasting

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.720 
surfaces and I'm absolutely roasting
I've<00:03:55.930> got<00:03:56.080> my<00:03:56.170> body<00:03:56.380> armor<00:03:56.740> on<00:03:56.770> and<00:03:57.520> it's

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
I've got my body armor on and it's

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.360 
I've got my body armor on and it's
probably<00:03:58.000> about<00:03:58.420> 26<00:03:59.410> degrees<00:03:59.770> and<00:04:00.130> it's<00:04:00.220> only

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
probably about 26 degrees and it's only

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.070 
probably about 26 degrees and it's only
just<00:04:00.580> gone<00:04:00.760> 8<00:04:00.970> o'clock<00:04:01.330> so<00:04:01.570> I<00:04:01.600> think<00:04:01.690> it's<00:04:01.900> time

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
just gone 8 o'clock so I think it's time

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.920 
just gone 8 o'clock so I think it's time
