00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
is loaded in here with what's called the

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.139 
is loaded in here with what's called the
Stingers<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.770> stinger<00:00:45.100> is<00:00:45.250> basically<00:00:45.610> an

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
Stingers the stinger is basically an

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.090 
Stingers the stinger is basically an
extendable<00:00:48.120> inflexible<00:00:49.469> guide<00:00:50.469> that'll

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
extendable inflexible guide that'll

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.920 
extendable inflexible guide that'll
allow<00:00:51.550> you<00:00:51.610> to<00:00:51.699> get<00:00:51.850> one<00:00:52.090> end<00:00:52.300> of<00:00:52.390> the<00:00:52.480> boat<00:00:52.660> in

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
allow you to get one end of the boat in

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.229 
allow you to get one end of the boat in
place<00:00:53.379> so<00:00:54.280> you're<00:00:54.399> on<00:00:54.460> lifting<00:00:54.789> half<00:00:55.000> of<00:00:55.149> the

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
place so you're on lifting half of the

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:56.880 
place so you're on lifting half of the
way<00:00:55.329> to<00:00:55.390> the<00:00:55.539> boat<00:00:55.660> of<00:00:55.899> time<00:00:56.050> and<00:00:56.379> then<00:00:56.649> you<00:00:56.680> can

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
way to the boat of time and then you can

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.819 
way to the boat of time and then you can
sort<00:00:57.399> of<00:00:57.520> slide<00:00:57.820> the<00:00:57.969> boat<00:00:58.120> into<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:58.829> saddles

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
sort of slide the boat into the saddles

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.650 
sort of slide the boat into the saddles
it<00:01:00.340> does<00:01:00.609> have<00:01:00.789> a<00:01:00.820> rubber<00:01:01.120> padding<00:01:01.539> on<00:01:01.600> the

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
it does have a rubber padding on the

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.079 
it does have a rubber padding on the
bottom<00:01:01.870> and<00:01:02.230> so<00:01:02.920> when<00:01:03.100> it<00:01:03.219> does<00:01:03.370> contact

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
bottom and so when it does contact

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.400 
bottom and so when it does contact
vehicle<00:01:04.479> it's<00:01:04.570> not<00:01:04.690> going<00:01:04.839> to<00:01:04.899> scratch<00:01:05.110> or
