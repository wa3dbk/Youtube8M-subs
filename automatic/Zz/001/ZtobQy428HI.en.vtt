we<00:00:13.300> are<00:00:13.420> continuing<00:00:14.020> our<00:00:14.110> training<00:00:14.500> this<00:00:14.800> time

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.040 
we are continuing our training this time

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.470 
we are continuing our training this time
we're<00:00:15.310> gonna<00:00:15.460> play<00:00:15.760> in<00:00:15.820> this<00:00:15.970> era<00:00:16.180> the<00:00:16.299> fret

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 
we're gonna play in this era the fret

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.990 
we're gonna play in this era the fret
board<00:00:16.510> between<00:00:16.840> fret<00:00:17.200> 9<00:00:17.500> and<00:00:17.890> 12<00:00:18.250> this

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 
board between fret 9 and 12 this

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.030 
board between fret 9 and 12 this
exercise<00:00:19.480> is<00:00:19.600> a<00:00:19.660> very<00:00:19.840> logical<00:00:20.140> one<00:00:20.680> once<00:00:20.950> you

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.040 
exercise is a very logical one once you

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.220 
exercise is a very logical one once you
start<00:00:21.369> memorizing<00:00:22.210> the<00:00:22.570> the<00:00:22.779> shapes<00:00:23.020> you'll

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
start memorizing the the shapes you'll

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.100 
start memorizing the the shapes you'll
see<00:00:23.410> that<00:00:23.560> there<00:00:23.740> is<00:00:23.860> a<00:00:23.890> consistency<00:00:24.520> and<00:00:25.110> and

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.110 
see that there is a consistency and and

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.900 
see that there is a consistency and and
your<00:00:26.290> fingers<00:00:26.650> are<00:00:26.890> going<00:00:27.160> to<00:00:27.400> know<00:00:27.610> without

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
your fingers are going to know without

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.060 
your fingers are going to know without
having<00:00:28.420> to<00:00:28.540> look<00:00:28.750> at<00:00:28.930> the<00:00:29.050> tab<00:00:29.290> where<00:00:29.680> to<00:00:29.920> go

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
having to look at the tab where to go

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.820 
having to look at the tab where to go
and<00:00:30.400> that's<00:00:31.270> valid<00:00:31.930> with<00:00:32.080> all<00:00:32.230> the<00:00:32.349> exercises

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:32.830 
and that's valid with all the exercises

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.940 
and that's valid with all the exercises
really<00:00:33.540> one<00:00:34.540> finger<00:00:34.870> per<00:00:34.900> fret<00:00:35.080> which<00:00:35.530> is<00:00:35.650> very

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
really one finger per fret which is very

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.340 
really one finger per fret which is very
very<00:00:36.280> important<00:00:36.820> we're<00:00:37.059> gonna<00:00:37.239> work<00:00:37.750> this<00:00:38.080> on

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
very important we're gonna work this on

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.900 
very important we're gonna work this on
a<00:00:38.699> combination<00:00:39.699> of<00:00:39.820> two<00:00:40.090> absent<00:00:40.780> strings<00:00:41.080> and

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
a combination of two absent strings and

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.250 
a combination of two absent strings and
the<00:00:42.910> logic<00:00:43.270> is<00:00:43.360> as<00:00:43.660> follows

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
the logic is as follows

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.600 
the logic is as follows
I'm<00:00:44.379> gonna<00:00:44.530> start<00:00:44.710> on<00:00:44.769> the<00:00:44.860> the<00:00:45.220> high<00:00:45.370> E<00:00:45.580> string

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
I'm gonna start on the the high E string

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.320 
I'm gonna start on the the high E string
play<00:00:46.390> seven<00:00:46.960> playoff<00:00:47.320> Ritz<00:00:47.800> nine<00:00:48.059> ten<00:00:49.059> and

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.330 
play seven playoff Ritz nine ten and

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.600 
play seven playoff Ritz nine ten and
then<00:00:50.170> it<00:00:50.290> will<00:00:50.440> go<00:00:50.890> on<00:00:50.920> the<00:00:51.070> next<00:00:51.190> string

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
then it will go on the next string

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.250 
then it will go on the next string
playing<00:00:51.940> frets<00:00:52.449> 12<00:00:52.720> 11<00:00:54.089> so<00:00:55.089> it's<00:00:55.120> like<00:00:55.420> kind<00:00:56.229> of

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
playing frets 12 11 so it's like kind of

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.710 
playing frets 12 11 so it's like kind of
like<00:00:56.409> narrowing<00:00:57.190> in<00:00:57.460> I'm<00:00:57.850> going<00:00:58.390> from<00:00:58.540> the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
like narrowing in I'm going from the

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.380 
like narrowing in I'm going from the
outside<00:00:58.750> of<00:00:59.050> the<00:00:59.140> scale<00:00:59.379> to<00:00:59.530> the<00:00:59.650> inside<00:01:00.040> in

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
outside of the scale to the inside in

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.649 
outside of the scale to the inside in
both<00:01:01.390> directions<00:01:01.780> and<00:01:02.470> once<00:01:02.680> I'll<00:01:02.830> play<00:01:02.979> that

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
both directions and once I'll play that

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:06.780 
both directions and once I'll play that
I'm<00:01:04.659> gonna<00:01:04.839> do<00:01:05.080> it<00:01:05.199> on<00:01:05.440> the<00:01:05.500> second<00:01:06.310> string<00:01:06.580> and

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
I'm gonna do it on the second string and

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.060 
I'm gonna do it on the second string and
the<00:01:07.690> first<00:01:07.960> string<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:11.170> just<00:01:11.409> practice<00:01:11.799> that

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
the first string so just practice that

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.219 
the first string so just practice that
segment<00:01:14.190> you<00:01:15.190> can<00:01:15.370> loop<00:01:15.549> with<00:01:15.790> that<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:17.049> don't

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
segment you can loop with that you don't

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.830 
segment you can loop with that you don't
need<00:01:17.380> to<00:01:17.590> use<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:18.670> French<00:01:18.880> string<00:01:19.149> just<00:01:19.570> one

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
need to use the French string just one

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.240 
need to use the French string just one
string<00:01:20.200> and<00:01:20.619> then<00:01:20.799> once<00:01:21.009> you're<00:01:21.130> comfortable

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
string and then once you're comfortable

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.670 
string and then once you're comfortable
with<00:01:21.610> that<00:01:21.700> try<00:01:22.119> to<00:01:22.149> play<00:01:23.049> that<00:01:23.289> shape<00:01:24.509> across

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
with that try to play that shape across

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.550 
with that try to play that shape across
all<00:01:26.680> the<00:01:26.829> different<00:01:26.979> strings

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.110 

at<00:01:33.560> this<00:01:33.770> very<00:01:33.950> very<00:01:34.220> slowly<00:01:34.550> and<00:01:34.910> then<00:01:34.970> use

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
at this very very slowly and then use

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.230 
at this very very slowly and then use
the<00:01:35.270> backing<00:01:35.570> track<00:01:35.810> if<00:01:36.470> at<00:01:36.770> any<00:01:37.010> time<00:01:37.240> things

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
the backing track if at any time things

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.450 
the backing track if at any time things
become<00:01:38.420> sloppy<00:01:38.930> or<00:01:39.170> you<00:01:39.500> can't<00:01:39.800> keep<00:01:40.010> up<00:01:40.250> or

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
become sloppy or you can't keep up or

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.860 
become sloppy or you can't keep up or
you<00:01:40.520> feel<00:01:40.730> pain<00:01:41.030> or<00:01:41.270> you<00:01:41.330> feel<00:01:41.480> that<00:01:41.540> you<00:01:41.720> have

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
you feel pain or you feel that you have

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.690 
you feel pain or you feel that you have
to<00:01:41.900> reposition<00:01:42.230> your<00:01:42.560> pick<00:01:42.830> means<00:01:43.550> that

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
to reposition your pick means that

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.820 
to reposition your pick means that
you're<00:01:43.790> going<00:01:44.000> too<00:01:44.150> fast<00:01:44.360> go<00:01:45.170> back<00:01:45.350> to<00:01:45.590> a<00:01:45.620> very

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
you're going too fast go back to a very

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.280 
you're going too fast go back to a very
slow<00:01:46.040> speed<00:01:46.100> this<00:01:46.490> might<00:01:46.700> take<00:01:46.910> a<00:01:47.180> week<00:01:47.960> if<00:01:48.170> it

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
slow speed this might take a week if it

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.810 
slow speed this might take a week if it
needs<00:01:48.410> to<00:01:48.590> or<00:01:48.770> a<00:01:48.800> month<00:01:49.130> it<00:01:49.310> doesn't<00:01:49.520> matter

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
needs to or a month it doesn't matter

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.580 
needs to or a month it doesn't matter
but<00:01:50.120> this<00:01:50.420> is<00:01:50.600> going<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:50.930> be<00:01:51.050> beneficial<00:01:51.410> for

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
but this is going to be beneficial for

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.410 
but this is going to be beneficial for
you<00:01:51.740> playing<00:01:52.040> later<00:01:52.340> on<00:01:52.550> when<00:01:52.820> you're<00:01:53.000> playing

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
you playing later on when you're playing

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.770 
you playing later on when you're playing
musical<00:01:53.870> ideas<00:01:54.260> this<00:01:55.250> is<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.910> tool<00:01:56.360> that<00:01:56.630> is

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
musical ideas this is the tool that is

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.260 
musical ideas this is the tool that is
going<00:01:56.930> to<00:01:56.990> help<00:01:57.200> you<00:01:57.470> focus<00:01:57.800> on<00:01:58.190> the<00:01:58.910> musical

going to help you focus on the musical

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.780 
going to help you focus on the musical
idea<00:01:59.630> not<00:02:00.229> on<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.740> technique<00:02:01.160> and<00:02:01.370> not<00:02:01.490> worry
