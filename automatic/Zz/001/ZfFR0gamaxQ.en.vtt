00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.300
 hello lemons how are you good this 

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.890
 time is I bring a video about the 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.019
 whitening teeth as you can 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.419
 see already in the title of the video and good 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.879
 I hope you like it is a video that I 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:15.489
 I was looking for quite as much on youtube as 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.590
 I searched for comments in forums for 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:19.180
 dare to use it to make a 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.590
 whitening treatment at home 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.990
 because well you know that the 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.430
 treatments at dentists are usually 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.440
 quite expensive or that for the 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.970
 pocket does not come at all well so 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.500
 nothing if you want to see how I could 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.720
 whiten my teeth that you are going to see 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.969
 good video and the first thing that 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.489
 I want to talk is the first and the only thing 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:38.859
 Of course, what I say is this treatment 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.100
 they are some strips I suppose that already the 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:45.640
 you will know are from cree is the brand you think 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.530
 only sold in the USA in Spain that I 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.149
 know you can not get unless you 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.309
 be on the internet like I did 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.260
 obviously but in physical store I think 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.659
 that you can not get any 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.429
 way and well if so, you know some 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:58.929
 leave me in the comments 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:00.040
 and well I'm going to talk a little bit about 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:02.320
 this 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.100
 the truth is that before daring to 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.360
 approve 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.230
 Well, as I said at the beginning 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.240
 I searched enough I searched enough 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.370
 comments from people I saw videos of 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.440
 youtube and the truth is that good almost 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.610
 everyone said good things almost 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.410
 everybody not I think that all the 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.090
 world said good things simply in 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.210
 more or less, there were people who 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.250
 life had gone super well other people 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.380
 I did not notice it that much but good 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.030
 the world was more or less satisfied 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.690
 there was no stopping he had had problems 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.610
 or anything like that and risk me and the 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.500
 truth is that I have done quite well 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.390
 I am among the people who are not 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.619
 super satisfied 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.220
 It may also be that I did not have the 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.410
 Very dark teeth I do not smoke I do not drink coffee 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.300
 some coffee once in a while but if 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.160
 usually drink tea and tea supposed to 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.520
 also those of the dark ones 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.650
 yellow a little bit so well that's not 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.360
 I am happy with the good things I have 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.910
 made a seven - day treatment now 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.490
 it was explained like this and there of several 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.890
 days I think the maximum is 15 days 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.170
 it's a treatment that for what I put 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.270
 in my instructions that came to me more or 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.330
 can only be done once a year 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.190
 thing like that because this is not the best either 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.989
 for the teeth analogous damages in fact 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.510
 this is better than using bicarbonate 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:20.300
 because the vÃ­car do not know if you heard that 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.190
 a lot of people who are bleached 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.800
 baking in a brush and rubbing 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.870
 but those damage the enamel and neither 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.420
 even if it is an ingredient the bicarbonate 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.269
 natural does not have to be 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.280
 better and good this does not hurt you anymore 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.290
 I say that you can not use all 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.920
 months or even two or three times 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.590
 year but you will notice it in minor 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.080
 or greater measure and good I will explain 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.840
 and come some bands that now I will leave you 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.730
 around here and good here you can see a 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.280
 little bit has a long one for the part of 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.870
 up to the teeth above and other 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.170
 more short for those below 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.780
 you just have to open this 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.370
 but I do not have it because obviously I have 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.440
 spent 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.989
 that yes take it off with care do not go 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.050
 to put the finger in the middle of all the 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.390
 glue is not glue but it is the 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.880
 treatment that is to whiten the 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.709
 pretty I advise you that yes that you 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.300
 put first the one below I explain 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.400
 because I got to first 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.200
 first the one above and as tasks a 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.269
 little bit because you do not know how it goes 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.640
 well you want to put it perfect you're going 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.140
 accumulating a bit of saliva and that's clear 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.790
 the accumulated here below then the 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.380
 teeth below and it cost me more to paste it 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.160
 because with the saliva he had not given me 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:37.220
 account and it cost me more then then what 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.660
 I did the next day I put the first 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.819
 from below before it's that from that 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.610
 out accumulating output it hit me a lot 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:46.220
 better then you put the work as 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.630
 the band is wider than your 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.510
 teeth with what is left over 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.670
 and then you stick inside and up 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.070
 I already tell you that it is a little more 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.690
 wide that our teeth precisely 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.890
 so that it does not fall short and if there 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.750
 someone who has a tooth a little 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.840
 bigger we will be by 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.500
 here one part and the other not only os 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.850
 you have to take that stick well 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.280
 all the teeth and now you only have 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.950
 to wait half an hour this becomes a 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.410
 once a day you see for example I would 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.160
 I bought I bought 7 of these for during 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.100
 7 days 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.930
 every day half an hour you can not eat or 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.400
 nothing going to notice that accumulates 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.860
 saliva because he has also given me 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.560
 thing to swallow that leaves a little bit of 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.990
 taste, nothing is water but I noticed that 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.920
 something had spread in your mouth 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.420
 then it was accumulating a bit of 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.370
 saliva but good in half an hour it 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.840
 Holds perfectly to something else that you 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.940
 I have to say you can not wash the 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.620
 teeth neither before nor after 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.230
 so I explain them as I did for 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.150
 example I dined better than mouth with water 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.790
 so that there were no remains and because 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.140
 I also do not like the sensations that you 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.960
 know the food in hotel abando tilde 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:56.889
 then I just rinse with water 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.389
 and then I put them on - leave half an hour and 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.009
 then you can not wash the 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:01.840
 not because I did not know how long 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:04.960
 it was so I did not go to bed without washing 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.449
 my teeth I poured water in my mouth and it 's 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.150
 One night is not a very comfortable feeling 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:11.770
 because they know how to mouth dinner again 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.479
 but then that's why I recommend 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.580
 that if you can do it at night better 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.500
 because if you do it for the day then 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.599
 you go to the street you go to the ball 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.789
 feel everything is good the best is 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:25.960
 dine or rinse your mouth with your mouth 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:28.150
 spit water you put it half an hour or so 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.860
 you remove and until the next day 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.270
 then it goes out and then the mouth washes us 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.060
 the teeth and the normal next day 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:37.630
 you have to be during the treatment 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:40.660
 you can not drink coffee or coke or 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.940
 things about these sodas neither three nor 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.039
 things that can obscure you is something 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.840
 obvious because you are for the treatment and 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:49.120
 then after the treatment then 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.970
 you also have to be a few days I think 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.580
 that a few weeks and without taking it so 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.960
 good if you like soda 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.180
 It is also an ideal time to 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.970
 remove them a little bit because a lot of sugar and 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.590
 those things but good that I like not 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:06.099
 just take and say I do not like the 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:07.509
 Coca-Cola refreshments or anything not only takes 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:09.520
 the coffee and I liked less soil so 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:11.020
 I had no major problem mind then good 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.960
 a few days without drinking tea, nothing happens 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.990
 and it's good I chose as I told you 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.639
 seven- day treatment that of 14 15 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.979
 then I noticed it less I guess 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:24.340
 it will be for that reason clear less days less 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:26.469
 effect but yes or yes I took a picture of 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.690
 before and after but not really 

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:30.039
 I know by use or something is not noticeable but I 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.289
 I have noticed it and I have been noticed without 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:34.090
 say that I was using it so 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:36.490
 more we noticed that he had teeth 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:39.190
 implants you have not done a treatment 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.000
 because it's that but how are you using a 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.430
 pasta 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.320
 with white high to good and I use 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.330
 then a paste with white 2 I think that a 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.580
 see my favorite products that 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:52.060
 it's an oral one that did not make me much 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.890
 effect as I told you but with these I 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.990
 I think it helps increase what I do not know 

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:58.920
 same things are fine but well I think 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:01.540
 I do not know if it will be seen on the screen 

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:04.030
 the one that is said to see me 

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:06.150
 I feel more white I noticed 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:09.730
 quite a thing that only with the 

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:12.220
 scientist I did not notice it and with this the 

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:13.690
 it's true that it's been great for me 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:16.840
 I bought on ebay as I told you only 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.790
 find online and have a price 

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.770
 pretty good you have to be careful 

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:23.380
 because there are imitations but good I 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:25.270
 I will leave the link below below and to whom 

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:27.940
 I bought it that has very good 

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:30.790
 comments and if it's legit then let's go 

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:32.230
 I did not have any problem and it's what 

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.060
 cheaper because you know how good 

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:36.670
 lobÃ³n ebay each one puts their prices 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:39.550
 but I do not remember the price for 

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:41.620
 the seven days but twelve euros I do not know and 

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:44.200
 I do not remember quite well compared 

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:46.590
 that is worth an approach that is 500 or 

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:49.969
 more or thereabouts but we is not cheap 

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:51.889
 so nothing I think that 

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:53.779
 that we are going it shows the result 

00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:56.269
 although it is not so spectacular but 

00:07:53.779 --> 00:07:57.769

00:07:56.269 --> 00:07:59.119
