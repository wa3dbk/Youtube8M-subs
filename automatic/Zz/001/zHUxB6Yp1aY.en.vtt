00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.270
 hi girls how about in today's video 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.670
 5 other favorites from yesterday 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.189
 good I start with this defining cream 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.099
 of curls is of the mark desert is itself 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.930
 is the line has several lines of 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:25.710
 lemon of I do not know what of a lot of things 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.660
 and well this is the coconut line and it smells 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.349
 to piña colada to me I smell exactly 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.030
 just like the manicure and good is a the 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.239
 texture that it has is like a texture of 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.120
 mask water yes yes yes because no no 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.800
 it falls and well it is the little quantity I do not 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.660
 he gave it to me in the roots, he gave it to me 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.400
 down here so rather in the 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.040
 points which is where it curls the most and is 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.540
 where curls are least defined and 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.830
 the more it spoils, they fall apart and 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.810
 good is for hydrated hair not what 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.180
 dirty does not leave it stiff as a foam 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.640
 and the curl leaves it very soft and defined 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.350
 it takes little amount lasts a lot is 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.250
 baratitos I'll leave the link to all 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.930
 the products in the information box 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.970
 so highly recommended for those who 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.220
 you have curly hair another thing is 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.690
 this is the one nail claim that he used it 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.640
 in a manicure that I recently uploaded 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.020
 I leave the video in the box 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.330
 information if you do not forget it because 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.370
 many times I say and then video me 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.330
 I realize when I already have a lot of 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.790
 reproductions that has been forgotten 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.250
 put the other videos but good that 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.979
 is in the channel and well this will be a 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.390
 they go in there and it gets like that it's like a 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.580
 footprint I do not know if you can see it there 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.560
 they are placed on top of the entire nail and 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.510
 You can use all the cuticles with 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.700
 enamel and without enamel what it does is 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.159
 strengthen the nail moisturize and good 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.840
 I take care of it in all 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.310
 manicures that I do before the 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.650
 enamel although you can give it on top of 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.030
 enamel and then it is applied in this way 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.690
 I'm going to give it to a nail so that 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:57.170
 see 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:59.600
 you catch it gets that way over like that and 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.730
 then there's a little massage like that and the nail and 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.440
 the cuticle absorbs it 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.390
 and well I like it a lot for 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.670
 cuticles because I leave them hydrated 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.320
 and the nails I have strong so 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.080
 I can not tell you about that but I have 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.640
 read reviews on this product and the 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.490
 people who have weak nails and that 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.080
 He says it has helped them a lot and I think 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.580
 which is a product with which I will repeat and 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.470
 I will always have already gotten used to 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.260
 use it is going well and well I have it there 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.650
 in all manicures I use something else 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.290
 super favorite is this lip scrub 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.730
 I have a limited edition of that 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.500
 is that it's good in a little jar they came 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.960
 few granules and I put a little more 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.240
 of sugar and such but you have to 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.910
 give and then remove it, this one is not 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.290
 it's a Navarre so it has sugar 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.209
 I would say good brown 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.739
 and he gives it to you if he does an exfoliation 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.329
 instant does not have to be a 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.459
 treatment and such but for example 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.959
 I do not have my lips very well now and 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.310
 I want to give myself a lipstick with which I 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.769
 they are going to score or I do not want to give my life 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.549
 but I want to have good lips 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.970
 instantly because now I 'm going 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.769
 example and lame I apply it I give myself a 9 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.560
 massage like this now because I have 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.620
 lipstick and a light massage leaves you 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.209
 perfect lips at the moment 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.280
 exfoliates 2 e hydrous this while 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.439
 Sun is already hydrated because that after you 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.079
 I say did not hydrate only exfolia goes this 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:20.120
 yes and also tastes sweet is always 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.069
 riding in jeff and for something it will be me 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.850
 I recommend it a lot worth three dollars and 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.740
 good 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.660
 the last times I asked yesterday 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.070
 is still exhausted and I will not ask for 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.140
 have me here a spare but not 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.450
 I think it's very easy to spend but 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.830
 just in case and to give it to my mother 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.290
 and my sister good because I think she is 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.180
 a product of 10 very recommended cheap 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.150
 you should all have this scrub 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.450
 Another product is this balm for 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.430
 cuticles is from the brand Vázquez and good 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.150
 it smells like lemon 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.549
 and it's not a butter 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.910
 has another texture I do not know how to explain it 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:59.400
 has a texture is not wax 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.500
 if not me here if I squeeze I put my finger and 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.600
 I do not do it especially hot 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.520
 I do not know if you can see it there but it's 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.830
 I do not know what texture to tell you is a texture 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:14.470
 as well as granules or if you are going to tell us 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:17.200
 Grainy but not kind balsam kind 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.299
 it does not matter how much texture it has 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.160
 little the important thing are the effects and I 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.170
 I give it to him then when an ago I want 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.880
 remove the cuticles for back lame 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.560
 with him a little bit of quantity I'm going 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.060
 thus giving in the cuticles of a hand 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.580
 of the other and then I start with the stick 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.650
 orange to remove them go back 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.890
 to back perfectly let the nail 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.810
 well hydrated and then I remove it well a 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.400
 little bit and I do not remove it completely email and 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.310
 I paint my nails and the glaze goes 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.169
 well with her and with other products that 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.700
 you have to remove them, wash your 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.830
 hands because if not then the manicure will 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.030
 is is a picture with this not because to 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.850
 me at least I absorbed it 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.380
 cuticle and that removes fine retreat 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.419
 very well the cuticles with it smells very 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.740
 While lemon is indispensable in my 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.470
 steps when I remove the cuticles 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.140
 which can be once a month 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.940
 once every two months you do not depend and 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.110
 I really like to try different things 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.660
 but I think this is a bet 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.510
 sure that I will always have there and for 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:13.480
 last now the warmth comes and 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.340
 we are going to teach the feet because this 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.470
 balsam that I used last year 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.270
 all summer is a balm for feet 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.530
 of the little brand that I do not remember 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.350
 but surely it worth 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.710
 baratito and this is indeed a one oil 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:29.640
 Vaseline I do not know if you can see it there 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.640
 that is harder 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.380
 smells 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.870
 I do not know how to say you smell like yes 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.430
 outside as if it were a cocoa of lips 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.880
 If you smell it, I would think it's a 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:45.060
 lip balm but has a touch to 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:47.690
 mint but let's smell nicer and so 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.580
 that I used mint and good for 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.320
 moisturize my feet I give it to me because I do not know 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.760
 how is the foot the big toe here I think 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.760
 which is where I give it to me and then in the 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.680
 heel and very well very well leaves them very 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.900
 hydrated and if you put a sock 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.140
 and to act all night and so on 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.850
 good a great one I liked a lot 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.500
 and it's a thing that occupies little that 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:09.570
 I have there on the table that when 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.040
 in the summer I'm watching TV by the 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.630
 night and he is taking it and on the table 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.460
 like a little bit and I give it to him when having the 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.930
 standing in the air in winter I forget 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.310
 because with socks and everything gives me 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.260
 very lazy but in summer I used it 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.670
 every two times three and nothing until here the 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:24.170
 video I hope you liked it and we 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:24.170
 we see in the following a kiss goodbye
