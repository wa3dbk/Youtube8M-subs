a video that would tell me you know how
how<00:00:18.169> if<00:00:19.169> it<00:00:19.410> leaked<00:00:19.679> at<00:00:19.859> all<00:00:20.009> or<00:00:20.400> if<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.300> worked

you wonder mainly if it leaks
I've<00:00:26.249> had<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:27.499> Badlands<00:00:28.499> exhaust<00:00:29.279> cut<00:00:29.550> out<00:00:29.669> for

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
I've had a Badlands exhaust cut out for

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.720 
I've had a Badlands exhaust cut out for
several<00:00:30.419> years<00:00:30.839> now<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.550> actually<00:00:32.550> I've<00:00:32.610> had

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
several years now and actually I've had

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.460 
several years now and actually I've had
three<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.270> them<00:00:33.450> over<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.930> course<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.320> like

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
three of them over the course of like

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.220 
three of them over the course of like
six<00:00:34.770> years<00:00:34.830> and<00:00:35.450> every<00:00:36.450> single<00:00:36.750> one<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.050> those

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
six years and every single one of those

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.680 
six years and every single one of those
leaked<00:00:37.560> so<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.490> knew<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:38.820> when<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.240> got<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.450> new

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
leaked so I knew that when I got a new

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.710 
leaked so I knew that when I got a new
cutout<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.320> did<00:00:40.530> not<00:00:40.650> want<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:41.720> throttle

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
cutout that I did not want that throttle

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.100 
cutout that I did not want that throttle
plate<00:00:43.170> style<00:00:43.560> cut<00:00:43.920> out<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.720> badlands<00:00:45.720> uses

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
plate style cut out that badlands uses

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.010 
plate style cut out that badlands uses
so<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.490> read<00:00:47.910> up<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.540> Dougs

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
so I read up on the Dougs

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.440 
so I read up on the Dougs
headers<00:00:49.620> cut<00:00:50.100> out<00:00:50.220> which<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.060> a<00:00:51.090> different

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
headers cut out which is a different

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.480 
headers cut out which is a different
design<00:00:51.540> and<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.830> looks<00:00:53.100> pretty<00:00:53.220> good<00:00:53.340> and

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:53.490 
design and it looks pretty good and

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.550 
design and it looks pretty good and
everybody<00:00:53.940> said<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:55.170> know<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.440> was<00:00:55.530> a

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.560 
everybody said that you know it was a

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.560 
everybody said that you know it was a
lot<00:00:55.770> sturdier<00:00:56.040> and<00:00:56.580> and<00:00:56.970> it<00:00:57.060> was<00:00:57.180> probably

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
lot sturdier and and it was probably

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.350 
lot sturdier and and it was probably
work<00:00:57.840> better<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.320> seal<00:00:58.500> better<00:00:58.820> so<00:00:59.820> I<00:00:59.850> went

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
work better and a seal better so I went

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.300 
work better and a seal better so I went
ahead<00:01:00.450> and<00:01:00.630> I<00:01:00.750> bought<00:01:00.780> one<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.290> when<00:01:02.040> I<00:01:02.070> bought

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.310 
ahead and I bought one and when I bought

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.729 
ahead and I bought one and when I bought
it<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.670> decided<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.660> would<00:01:03.810> go<00:01:03.960> all<00:01:04.170> out<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.409> just

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
it I decided I would go all out and just

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.950 
it I decided I would go all out and just
cut<00:01:04.859> a<00:01:04.890> hole<00:01:04.949> into<00:01:05.399> my<00:01:05.579> floorboard<00:01:06.390> here<00:01:06.479> so

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
cut a hole into my floorboard here so

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.919 
cut a hole into my floorboard here so
that<00:01:07.109> I<00:01:07.140> could<00:01:07.439> fit<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.859> in<00:01:07.979> there<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.929> after

00:01:09.919 --> 00:01:09.929 
that I could fit it in there and after

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:12.919 
that I could fit it in there and after
buying<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.649> have<00:01:10.950> since<00:01:11.909> turned<00:01:12.329> it<00:01:12.539> on<00:01:12.630> I

00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:12.929 
buying it I have since turned it on I

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:15.319 
buying it I have since turned it on I
actually<00:01:13.710> just<00:01:14.369> hooked<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.759> up<00:01:14.850> for<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.179> first

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.329 
actually just hooked it up for the first

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:17.179 
actually just hooked it up for the first
time<00:01:15.569> I've<00:01:15.810> driven<00:01:16.229> around<00:01:16.560> with<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.829> closed

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
time I've driven around with a closed

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.539 
time I've driven around with a closed
for<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> while<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.649> I<00:01:19.649> just<00:01:19.679> hooked<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.280> up<00:01:20.369> for

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
for a while and I just hooked it up for

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.609 
for a while and I just hooked it up for
the<00:01:20.609> first<00:01:20.909> time<00:01:21.319> to<00:01:23.149> see<00:01:24.229> you<00:01:25.229> know<00:01:25.350> what<00:01:25.530> it

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
the first time to see you know what it

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.120 
the first time to see you know what it
sounds<00:01:25.799> like

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
sounds like

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.819 
sounds like
opening<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.579> up<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.789> whatnot<00:01:27.149> and<00:01:27.829> sure

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
opening it up and whatnot and sure

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.639 
opening it up and whatnot and sure
enough<00:01:28.859> it<00:01:29.159> won't<00:01:29.340> open<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:30.139> you<00:01:31.139> can<00:01:31.289> you<00:01:31.499> can

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
enough it won't open so you can you can

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.219 
enough it won't open so you can you can
hear<00:01:31.829> yourself<00:01:32.240> I'm<00:01:33.240> not<00:01:33.299> trying<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.659> when<00:01:34.200> I

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
hear yourself I'm not trying to when I

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.840 
hear yourself I'm not trying to when I
push<00:01:34.469> the<00:01:34.619> button<00:01:34.649> and<00:01:34.889> try<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.039> open<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.429> it

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
push the button and try to open it it

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.039 
push the button and try to open it it
goes<00:01:36.240> like<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.569> I<00:01:37.490> want<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.549> try<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.729> close<00:01:38.939> it

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.539 

that's<00:01:43.049> all<00:01:43.409> it'll<00:01:43.619> do<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.950> won't<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.429> won't

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
that's all it'll do it won't it won't

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.949 
that's all it'll do it won't it won't
open<00:01:44.759> anything<00:01:45.209> it<00:01:45.299> just<00:01:45.359> makes<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.780> sound

00:01:45.949 --> 00:01:45.959 
open anything it just makes it sound

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:47.870 
open anything it just makes it sound
like<00:01:46.109> it's<00:01:46.319> trying<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.799> open<00:01:47.069> and<00:01:47.340> then<00:01:47.579> that's

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
like it's trying to open and then that's

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.609 
like it's trying to open and then that's
that

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
that

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.980 
that
and<00:01:49.619> then<00:01:49.770> moreso<00:01:50.729> than<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:51.209> even<00:01:51.749> worse

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
and then moreso than that even worse

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.719 
and then moreso than that even worse
than<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.649> my<00:01:52.829> opinion<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.789> that<00:01:53.929> it<00:01:54.929> leaks

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
than that in my opinion is that it leaks

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.469 
than that in my opinion is that it leaks
I<00:01:58.189> feel<00:01:59.189> like<00:01:59.399> there's<00:01:59.639> a<00:01:59.700> possibility<00:01:59.939> that

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
I feel like there's a possibility that

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.959 
I feel like there's a possibility that
when<00:02:00.990> they<00:02:01.109> ship<00:02:01.380> these<00:02:01.560> out<00:02:01.799> it's<00:02:02.429> not<00:02:02.670> in<00:02:02.850> a

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
when they ship these out it's not in a

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.389 
when they ship these out it's not in a
fully<00:02:03.240> closed<00:02:03.689> position<00:02:03.869> which<00:02:04.499> I'm<00:02:04.799> not<00:02:05.219> able

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
fully closed position which I'm not able

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.639 
fully closed position which I'm not able
to<00:02:05.549> fully<00:02:05.969> close<00:02:06.359> or<00:02:06.600> open<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.929> myself<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.619> I

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
to fully close or open it myself so I

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.679 
to fully close or open it myself so I
wouldn't<00:02:08.069> be<00:02:08.849> able<00:02:08.939> to<00:02:09.060> tell<00:02:09.239> if<00:02:09.420> that's<00:02:09.599> the

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:09.689 
wouldn't be able to tell if that's the

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:12.470 
wouldn't be able to tell if that's the
case<00:02:09.840> but<00:02:10.430> if<00:02:11.430> it's<00:02:11.670> not<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:11.939> the<00:02:12.000> fully<00:02:12.209> closed

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
case but if it's not in the fully closed

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.670 
case but if it's not in the fully closed
position<00:02:12.510> perhaps<00:02:13.170> when

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
position perhaps when

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.440 
position perhaps when
is<00:02:13.799> fully<00:02:14.099> closed<00:02:14.519> it<00:02:14.760> doesn't<00:02:15.000> leak<00:02:15.150> but<00:02:15.420> I

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
is fully closed it doesn't leak but I

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.990 
is fully closed it doesn't leak but I
can<00:02:15.659> tell<00:02:15.810> you<00:02:15.900> right<00:02:16.079> now<00:02:16.519> which<00:02:17.519> I<00:02:17.790> don't

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
can tell you right now which I don't

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.490 
can tell you right now which I don't
know<00:02:18.090> if<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.269> can<00:02:18.390> see<00:02:18.659> down<00:02:18.870> in<00:02:19.049> there

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
know if you can see down in there

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.390 
know if you can see down in there
probably<00:02:20.370> not<00:02:20.700> but<00:02:21.450> um<00:02:21.659> the<00:02:22.650> throttle<00:02:23.310> plate

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
probably not but um the throttle plate

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.640 
probably not but um the throttle plate
that<00:02:23.819> not<00:02:24.209> a<00:02:24.239> total<00:02:24.510> plate<00:02:24.659> but<00:02:24.780> they<00:02:24.930> the

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
that not a total plate but they the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.250 
that not a total plate but they the
plate<00:02:25.890> looks<00:02:26.370> like<00:02:26.579> it<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:26.909> closed<00:02:27.359> it's

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
plate looks like it is closed it's

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.009 
plate looks like it is closed it's
definitely<00:02:28.890> at<00:02:29.159> least<00:02:29.400> as<00:02:29.640> close<00:02:29.819> as<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.209> can

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
definitely at least as close as I can

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.619 
definitely at least as close as I can
tell<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:31.319> will<00:02:31.439> be<00:02:32.060> anyways<00:02:33.060> this<00:02:33.299> is<00:02:33.420> what<00:02:33.450> it

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
tell it will be anyways this is what it

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.250 
tell it will be anyways this is what it
sounds<00:02:33.959> like<00:02:35.209> with<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.389> car<00:02:36.599> turned<00:02:36.900> on<00:02:37.109> you

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
sounds like with the car turned on you

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.410 
sounds like with the car turned on you
can<00:02:37.409> hear<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.769> leak<00:02:37.950> probably<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.549> more<00:02:39.299> so

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
can hear the leak probably and more so

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.300 
can hear the leak probably and more so
than<00:02:39.569> hearing<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:40.019> put<00:02:40.230> my<00:02:40.349> hand<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:40.829> thought

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
than hearing it I put my hand I thought

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.649 
than hearing it I put my hand I thought
maybe<00:02:41.519> I<00:02:41.670> was<00:02:41.790> just<00:02:41.909> hearing<00:02:42.209> things<00:02:42.389> and<00:02:42.599> I

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
maybe I was just hearing things and I

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.619 
maybe I was just hearing things and I
put<00:02:42.810> my<00:02:42.930> hand<00:02:43.170> down<00:02:43.290> into<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.790> actual<00:02:45.150> cutout

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
put my hand down into the actual cutout

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.869 
put my hand down into the actual cutout
I<00:02:45.840> put<00:02:46.139> it<00:02:46.230> down<00:02:46.379> in<00:02:46.590> like<00:02:46.829> this<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.700> can

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.229 
I put it down in like this and you can
feel<00:02:48.209> exhaust<00:02:48.750> gas<00:02:48.989> coming<00:02:49.379> out<00:02:49.500> of<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:50.120> so<00:02:51.120> let

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
feel exhaust gas coming out of it so let

00:02:51.239 --> 00:03:00.110 
feel exhaust gas coming out of it so let
me<00:02:51.299> turn<00:02:51.450> this<00:02:51.599> on<00:02:51.750> for<00:02:51.810> you<00:02:51.989> oh<00:02:58.819> yeah<00:02:59.819> you<00:02:59.879> can

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.950 

I<00:03:06.940> don't<00:03:07.940> know<00:03:08.000> if<00:03:08.090> you<00:03:08.180> can<00:03:08.300> see<00:03:08.540> in<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.870> video

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
but there is definitely exhaust visibly

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.150 
but there is definitely exhaust visibly
coming<00:03:11.810> out<00:03:11.990> of<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.380> cutout<00:03:12.650> even<00:03:13.040> though

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
coming out of the cutout even though

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.120 
coming out of the cutout even though
it's<00:03:13.280> in<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.400> closed<00:03:13.640> position<00:03:15.940> so<00:03:17.710> yeah<00:03:18.710> as

let me say once again I'm not sure if

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.280 
let me say once again I'm not sure if
it's<00:03:23.300> fully<00:03:23.600> closed

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
it's fully closed

it's fully closed
I<00:03:24.380> can't<00:03:24.650> open<00:03:24.950> or<00:03:25.130> close<00:03:25.430> it<00:03:25.640> straight<00:03:26.210> out<00:03:26.270> of

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
I can't open or close it straight out of

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.730 
I can't open or close it straight out of
the<00:03:26.450> box<00:03:26.660> I<00:03:26.810> can't<00:03:27.020> open<00:03:27.260> or<00:03:27.320> close<00:03:27.500> it<00:03:27.620> which

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
the box I can't open or close it which

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.950 
the box I can't open or close it which
is<00:03:27.860> a<00:03:27.890> bad<00:03:28.100> thing<00:03:28.340> in<00:03:28.580> the<00:03:28.670> first<00:03:28.820> place<00:03:28.970> on<00:03:29.510> top

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 
is a bad thing in the first place on top

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.570 
is a bad thing in the first place on top
of<00:03:30.140> that<00:03:31.210> there<00:03:32.210> is<00:03:32.950> obviously<00:03:33.950> exhaust

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
of that there is obviously exhaust

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.900 
of that there is obviously exhaust
coming<00:03:35.000> out<00:03:35.210> of<00:03:35.360> it<00:03:35.480> and<00:03:35.660> it<00:03:36.230> could<00:03:36.440> be<00:03:36.910> not

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
coming out of it and it could be not

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.850 
coming out of it and it could be not
fully<00:03:38.180> closed<00:03:38.630> it<00:03:39.020> could<00:03:39.230> be<00:03:39.350> fully<00:03:39.530> closed

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
fully closed it could be fully closed

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.890 
fully closed it could be fully closed
I'm<00:03:40.100> not<00:03:40.340> sure<00:03:40.520> but<00:03:40.880> as<00:03:41.030> of<00:03:41.240> right<00:03:41.270> now<00:03:41.450> I'm

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
I'm not sure but as of right now I'm

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.030
