00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.560 
he'd have to be at least 25 years old
yes<00:05:00.500> that's<00:05:01.100> right<00:05:01.400> because<00:05:01.790> the<00:05:02.060> arcane<00:05:02.419> is

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
yes that's right because the arcane is

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.420 
yes that's right because the arcane is
such<00:05:02.810> a<00:05:02.840> difficult<00:05:03.200> magic<00:05:03.800> to<00:05:03.919> master<00:05:04.310> the

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
such a difficult magic to master the

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.940 
such a difficult magic to master the
earliest<00:05:04.880> he<00:05:05.030> could<00:05:05.060> be<00:05:05.360> adept<00:05:05.900> in<00:05:06.020> it<00:05:06.169> is<00:05:06.320> 25

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
earliest he could be adept in it is 25

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.920 
earliest he could be adept in it is 25
and<00:05:07.310> even<00:05:07.940> then<00:05:08.090> he'd<00:05:08.390> be<00:05:08.419> considered

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
and even then he'd be considered

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.030 
and even then he'd be considered
something<00:05:09.169> of<00:05:09.410> a<00:05:09.500> prodigy

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
something of a prodigy

so<00:05:10.790> really<00:05:11.120> it's<00:05:11.390> safer<00:05:11.780> if<00:05:11.840> he's<00:05:11.930> about<00:05:12.080> 30<00:05:12.530> or

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
so really it's safer if he's about 30 or

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.370 
so really it's safer if he's about 30 or
35<00:05:13.520> and<00:05:13.790> maybe<00:05:14.510> you<00:05:14.630> have<00:05:14.720> some<00:05:14.900> issues<00:05:15.230> with

35 and maybe you have some issues with
the<00:05:15.470> arcane<00:05:15.890> that<00:05:16.070> he<00:05:16.130> can't<00:05:16.370> quite<00:05:16.580> control

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
the arcane that he can't quite control
