 cystic taca in bed 

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:08.129
 do not 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.969
 [Music] 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.890
 hello guys hello girls how are we 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.220
 in a new tutorial of our channel 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.619
 mister learning 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.470
 As you can see it is a tutorial of how 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.140
 download and install and how to play 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.770
 nintendo 64 emulator games 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.669
 to be more concrete basically 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.030
 you enter in link I will leave you in the 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.940
 description and click aysén download 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.660
 as you can see if you download in about 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.719
 seconds to make it easier too 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.350
 I have included a file that serves to 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.570
 uninstall it 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.390
 for practically there are two files one 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.460
 to install and another to uninstall 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.730
 to make it easier for you, you will have 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.500
 the folder you open this with the wing rar 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.870
 you have the folder open the folder and 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.979
 here is the executable to install and 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.690
 the executable to uninstall good the 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.220
 rules a shortcut but it's for 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.120
 make it easier for you 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:16.560
 we basically open the set down 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.560
 we give in allow 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:25.600
 Now I know he is preparing aysén 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.920
 next I think I already have it 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.979
 installed I will give it in repair 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.250
 but you will come out simply 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.000
 following 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.650
 age is install we wanted to install the 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.510
 truth is that it is you will be more 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.780
 slow but good 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:48.150
 practically goes fast question of a 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.970
 couple of minutes and be to the jce in 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.730
 finalize and the problem is already that 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.220
 I do not know how you can see no access is created 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:00.050
 directly on the desktop then what 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:03.620
 you have to do is open start 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:07.260
 and if you do not have here, apply at all 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:11.070
 the programs say below 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:13.260
 and the folder called project 64 that 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.770
 is what the program is called there will be 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.720
 direct access 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.810
 I guess everyone will already know 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.390
 a shortcut 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.840
 but for those who do not know how to do it 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:28.590
 copy when you are above right click 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.970
 copy to the desktop right click paste 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.860
 direct access 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.200
 and you'll have up to that directory what 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.450
 I will put here 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.970
 then you open it 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.640
 maybe it will open this 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.430
 you have to download the games for 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.890
 they call them rooms if you want 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.120
 look for them you if you want to look for one 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.830
 special 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.150
 I will also leave this page of 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.530
 description is this page 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.300
 basically these are the top 20 of the 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.880
 most downloaded games and practically 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:05.290
 surely they are the ones that we 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.510
 know better and those that you do not like 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.640
 plus 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.130
 I will try now the 64 up early 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.700
 As you can see, you are here, you are going to 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.700
 to download 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.350
 and it will download as you can see 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.850
 practically occupies more the game than not 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.820
 the program itself 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.710
 it's a matter of a minute the truth is 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.570
 that the controls are a little different 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.970
 and in each game they can vary a bit 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.520
 but the truth is that you can 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.380
 configure me now I will teach you the ones that 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.120
 they come by default and if you do not like them 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.750
 Well, you will change them to 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.750
 your taste 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:52.680
 good guys pause the video and I already 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:55.940
 I'll be able to put back when I'm 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.940
 downloaded so far 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:04.110
 good guys as you can see it's already 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:06.710
 downloaded you do not have to touch or 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:10.540
 nothing you go to the emulator 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:13.719
 you can do file open room 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.909
 and it will open this or for easier when 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:19.329
 you see more practice you are in control 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:21.579
 and it's the same thing you're going to the folder 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.139
 where I had downloaded to you by 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.229
 defect is already open but good 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:29.620
 normally you go the downloads and there 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:32.970
 will be then what will you have 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.970
 and the game 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.210
 the only drawback is that it will be 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.210
 to be in this screen size 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.750
 the truth is that it's going very well for 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:47.470
 computers that do not have much 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.849
 capacity 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.660
 [Music] 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:54.750
 ah 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.380
 April the truth is that it does not go with anything 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.380
 nothing 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:07.740
 basically you move with the arrows and 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.240
 down when entering the walk on menu 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:14.419
 the rye center 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.419
 the difficulty in the case of this place 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.730
 [Music] 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:29.009
 or 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.059
 [Music] 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.059
 I am going to make one 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.759
 [Music] 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.960
 d 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:56.030
 in this game to accelerate the event 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.030
 tender 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:05.240
 [Music] 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:15.710
 life 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:15.710
 [Laughs] 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.269
 [Music] 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.960
 [Laughs] 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.150
 [Music] 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.860
 the truth 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.860
