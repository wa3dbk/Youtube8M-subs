against long shots his positioning could

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.520 
against long shots his positioning could
be<00:00:50.730> bad<00:00:50.910> as<00:00:51.059> times<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:51.510> his<00:00:51.600> reflexes<00:00:51.930> although

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.749 
example right here even though the shot
is<00:01:55.049> more<00:01:55.380> easier<00:01:55.710> for<00:01:55.740> him<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.100> save<00:01:56.280> he<00:01:56.430> reacts

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
is more easier for him to save he reacts

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.030 
is more easier for him to save he reacts
very<00:01:57.090> quickly<00:01:57.450> again<00:01:57.930> here<00:01:58.439> putting<00:01:58.710> his<00:01:58.860> leg

hasn't<00:02:21.260> been<00:02:21.379> that<00:02:21.560> good<00:02:21.830> but<00:02:22.280> especially

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
hasn't been that good but especially

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
didn't find it to be that low I found it

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.470 
didn't find it to be that low I found it
to<00:02:37.819> be<00:02:37.940> like<00:02:38.120> an<00:02:38.239> 83<00:02:38.920> 84<00:02:39.920> and<00:02:40.310> it<00:02:41.060> worked<00:02:41.330> out

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
to be like an 83 84 and it worked out

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.559 
to be like an 83 84 and it worked out
just<00:02:41.540> fine<00:02:42.110> in<00:02:42.680> game<00:02:43.129> the<00:02:43.610> main<00:02:43.819> weakness<00:02:44.150> I

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
just fine in game the main weakness I

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.380 
just fine in game the main weakness I
felt<00:02:44.900> with<00:02:45.140> this<00:02:45.230> card<00:02:45.530> was<00:02:45.950> his<00:02:46.220> handling<00:02:46.730> he

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
felt with this card was his handling he

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.390 
felt with this card was his handling he
has<00:02:47.540> an<00:02:47.810> 81<00:02:48.260> handling<00:02:48.830> in<00:02:48.980> game<00:02:49.220> but

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
has an 81 handling in game but

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.280 
has an 81 handling in game but
personally<00:02:49.880> he<00:02:50.120> did<00:02:50.269> not<00:02:50.450> catch<00:02:50.780> a<00:02:50.989> lot<00:02:51.260> of

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
personally he did not catch a lot of

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.559 
personally he did not catch a lot of
balls<00:02:51.590> for<00:02:51.709> me<00:02:51.920> he<00:02:52.310> allowed<00:02:52.579> a<00:02:52.610> good<00:02:53.030> amount<00:02:53.390> of

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
balls for me he allowed a good amount of

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.750 
balls for me he allowed a good amount of
second-chance<00:02:54.140> opportunities<00:02:54.829> just<00:02:55.459> slow

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
second-chance opportunities just slow

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.460 
second-chance opportunities just slow
shots<00:02:56.060> lil<00:02:56.299> dribblers<00:02:56.569> he<00:02:56.959> would<00:02:57.110> hit<00:02:57.230> off<00:02:57.349> in

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
shots lil dribblers he would hit off in

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.500 
shots lil dribblers he would hit off in
his<00:02:57.590> hands<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.069> allow<00:02:58.579> for<00:02:58.640> a<00:02:58.849> second<00:02:59.269> chance

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
his hands and allow for a second chance

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.720 
his hands and allow for a second chance
to<00:02:59.750> go<00:02:59.900> in<00:03:00.079> but<00:03:00.650> overall<00:03:00.920> he<00:03:01.280> is<00:03:01.400> a<00:03:01.430> very

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
to go in but overall he is a very

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.759 
to go in but overall he is a very
athletic<00:03:01.910> goalie<00:03:02.569> quit<00:03:03.079> coming<00:03:03.380> out<00:03:03.470> of<00:03:03.590> men

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
athletic goalie quit coming out of men

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.830 
athletic goalie quit coming out of men
and<00:03:04.010> I<00:03:04.220> found<00:03:04.489> his<00:03:04.670> positioning<00:03:05.209> to<00:03:05.360> be<00:03:05.480> better

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
and I found his positioning to be better

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.350 
and I found his positioning to be better
than<00:03:06.079> last<00:03:06.260> year<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:07.010> also<00:03:07.160> his<00:03:07.489> reflexes<00:03:07.910> to

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
than last year and also his reflexes to

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.960 
than last year and also his reflexes to
be<00:03:08.480> another<00:03:08.959> bonus<00:03:09.319> I<00:03:09.739> think<00:03:10.069> this<00:03:10.549> is<00:03:10.670> a<00:03:10.700> very

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
be another bonus I think this is a very

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.479 
be another bonus I think this is a very
solid<00:03:11.540> goalie<00:03:11.750> I'm<00:03:11.930> hoping<00:03:12.290> for<00:03:12.560> an<00:03:12.799> inform<00:03:13.400> to

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
solid goalie I'm hoping for an inform to

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.610 
solid goalie I'm hoping for an inform to

eight out of ten again the real negative

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.920 
eight out of ten again the real negative
being<00:03:22.340> that<00:03:22.609> he<00:03:22.790> allows<00:03:23.090> a<00:03:23.120> good<00:03:23.540> amount<00:03:23.780> of

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
second-chance opportunity but overall I

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:28.629 
second-chance opportunity but overall I
found<00:03:26.810> him<00:03:27.019> to<00:03:27.049> be<00:03:27.290> pretty<00:03:27.650> consistent<00:03:28.040> in<00:03:28.430> all

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
found him to be pretty consistent in all

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
with his diving on one-on-one chances he

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.059 
with his diving on one-on-one chances he
should<00:03:32.810> be<00:03:32.900> taking<00:03:33.230> up<00:03:33.350> a<00:03:33.500> little<00:03:33.799> bit<00:03:33.920> more

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
should be taking up a little bit more

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:35.949 
should be taking up a little bit more
space<00:03:34.340> or<00:03:34.790> extend<00:03:35.209> his<00:03:35.329> body<00:03:35.510> a<00:03:35.630> little<00:03:35.870> bit

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
space or extend his body a little bit

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.720 
space or extend his body a little bit
further<00:03:36.350> out<00:03:36.440> he's<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.100> best<00:03:37.280> going<00:03:37.519> the

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
further out he's the best going the

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.220 
further out he's the best going the
Premier<00:03:38.030> League<00:03:38.180> that<00:03:38.359> I<00:03:38.569> have<00:03:38.780> reviewed<00:03:39.079> so

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
Premier League that I have reviewed so

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.199 
Premier League that I have reviewed so
far<00:03:39.440> but<00:03:39.590> I<00:03:39.680> suspect<00:03:39.889> when<00:03:40.310> I<00:03:40.340> do<00:03:40.400> Courtois<00:03:40.940> in

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
far but I suspect when I do Courtois in

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.240 
far but I suspect when I do Courtois in
check<00:03:41.690> that<00:03:42.200> will<00:03:42.410> change<00:03:42.739> but<00:03:42.980> I<00:03:43.040> will

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
check that will change but I will

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.160 
check that will change but I will
address<00:03:43.459> that<00:03:43.730> when<00:03:44.000> I<00:03:44.030> review<00:03:44.450> them<00:03:44.600> so<00:03:45.019> he's

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
address that when I review them so he's

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.720 
address that when I review them so he's
pretty<00:03:45.380> good<00:03:45.590> I<00:03:45.620> found<00:03:45.950> to<00:03:46.040> be<00:03:46.160> a<00:03:46.190> good<00:03:46.489> goalie

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
pretty good I found to be a good goalie

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.789 
pretty good I found to be a good goalie
