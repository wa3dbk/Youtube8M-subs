00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:13.049

 yes yes yes you have good I wanted 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.160
 to make this video I hesitated several 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.990
 time at me saying yeah are you 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.609

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.990
 serious pro is what are you doing this just 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.820
 in front of your cam what are you doing that with 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.720
 game the right word tiozzo just kind 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.130
 in front of the cellar it will be interesting 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.050
 anyway it's a video 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.130
 because with people actually claimed 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.720
 in the sense that they had a lot of 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.369
 questions in relation to that it's the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.570
 active meeting with video essences I 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.340
 a little case of the reds to do because 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.760
 that I wanted to do it on Friday or 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.649
 Saturday 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.030
 Friday or Saturday I was lazy 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.710
 then I said to myself, good listen it's 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.780
 what sunday there is a case you have it 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.980
 does sunday and sunday of course but 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.030
 I found in the situation where you 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.050
 know when you know you have to do 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.670
 something I followed in the morning 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.100
 when you know you have to do something 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.000
 but only suddenly when you are 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.579
 obliged to do it you know you have to 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.649
 do it all at once 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.719
 useless who was fit to wear that you 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.850
 do not ever get used to it 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.170
 kind priority to yahoo have turned the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.070
 video I tidied my room there is a 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.840
 moment that you would have video me I 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.220
 caught up with his five episodes of my series 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.840
 I have not looked for a month 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.900
 you see what kind of stuff I did 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.409
 needless I would like to play a little bit 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.240
 am showered 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.920
 yes the shower 2nd week oriented gender 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.090
 be careful then no longer there I lied 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.189
 since I said tidy up the room then 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.720
 you see the brothel behind brief you 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.070
 is she to read and so jean bart 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.360
 how did I meet thibault so that 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.790
 this is one of the first questions that 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.320
 comes back most often and so is in 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.240
 make their beauty case we do the same 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.220
 manager with a person reads and me 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.080
 so exact zac and 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.540
 and in fact it was he who had the idea of 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.190
 his sweet voice I would have learned from my 4 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.050
 with jarry got the idea by saying good 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.000
 well here is a muscle and a big one 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.070
 french an arab a paperless a guy 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.080
 in rule on a kind where school and well you 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.820
 going kind we were totally opposite 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.310
 him of me you see him video muscles 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.650
 motivation muscu video month best of 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.660
 birthday I'm drinking good and not from 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.310
 blow that's me in front of the belly with 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.420
 people and ce1 and actually I can 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.910
 to say with the rose is actually actually 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.740
 it was like one of my collaborations 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.600
 which is best spent kind 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.240
 actually it went really well 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.350
 was great of course it was great 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.210
 one of the questions is that they fall under 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.630
 often that's what you could fire dr 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.620
 denis edged yes or no so good you 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.790
 doubt that in the life of all 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.040
 days when I saw that by 2 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.360
 medals that it's actually some 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.650
 thing that is reserved for videos 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.510
 it's a very cool person very 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.800
 normal in the end he's it's not a dude 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.880
 weird it's not with the one where they 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.950
 will do that same sensible when they 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.620
 see they do not believe you muses it you 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.180
 that not on the edge of tears announced 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.570
 a person that adobe is a pity that 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.370
 yes it will be great that 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.900
 project we had the will since four 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.510
 month or so when a bus prob the 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.680
 projects in the lead I was still running and 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.590
 I was finishing my classes like a month and 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.790
 half two months later and suddenly it 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.989
 who actually posed peace this problem 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.160
 because after that as soon as I'm done 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.360
 the races and the beginning of summer it was 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.040
 so we had some problems 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.450
 rule until a time you want it 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.260
 told me after a week before we 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.060
 either these videos he told me good listening 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.230
 but what do you still hawk 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.160
 it make where we wait to talk 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.110
 chinese we have problems 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.870
 logistical stuff all that go go there 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.330
 we do it then we did it we went 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.350
 quickly it's actually we were lucky that 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.810
 leave tonight videos of 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.070
 cameras and that I think we farted 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.239
 that I have an ease on camera that 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.709
 I can say that it was finally 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.299
 not too much trouble even if I'm not 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.100
 perfect I defend of course finally 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.780
 level the acting act bars the 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.780
 filming was pretty fast it's going kind 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.730
 one cameraman to do with who he is 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.019
 a friend of thibaut tony is the one who 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.690
 the falling all the videos I 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.680
 believe in any case he did a very good 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.590
 taf it's thanks to him that the video 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.820
 how well did he make 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.680
 cutting plans so it's me 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.180
 At the beginning you made the same scene 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.440
 from many different angles and where 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.570
 it's finally moving 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.070
 so I played badly as badly as that 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.780
 and then actually when I saw the result 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.430
 the same evening do not he had 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.459
 started editing 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.010
 yes and no and so suddenly say it is 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.120
 what is that said to me good since 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.109
 I was in the habit of 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.250
 turn in the case of eric staal 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.959
 thibault also goes logically 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.250
 bassett it was pretty fast it was 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.269
 enough actually it was fluid actually 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.069
 money things were pretty 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.930
 natural condÃ©s that we want 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.420
 say something we did more 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.489
 thibault and I have two pretty styles 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.079
 different him for example actually him 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.030
 as soon as they have to say something he 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.260
 the writing actually screams the scripts and 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.939
 it's logical that's what the majority 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.870
 youtube and responds to people what they 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:10.150
 have in mind they write it 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.739
 according to their products and I actually saw 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.329
 that I'm a fucking genius you see 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.739
 as soon as I want to say something 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.150
 develop it in my head and then I 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.380
 guard then after I repeat it and I 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.340
 make it to my sauce actually it happens to me 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.209
 often to make videos in fact in 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.479
 having a few hung phrases 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.610
 something while he's tackling it to me 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.050
 Issy choice and I say almost 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.550
 like that to tak tak and as you go 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.530
 in fact the debrief lime-debry jealous 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.669
 wave and I arrive at the final result that 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.660
 is a video of I said you have 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.400
 you enjoyed smoked in your thumb 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.259
 green short so he is 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.610
 started collaboration went well 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:38.500
 the result the video I was pretty 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.639
 happy and before very taboo it's 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.060
 really a chance to really observe 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:44.500
 extraordinary I gets off his 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.610
 hanging on the mark you like a guy 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.130
 you do muscu like that because 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.900
 so that's it now I've got up 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.030
 about october the allsaint there for me 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.710
 move your ass I move your ass I'm going 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.539
 to the muscu and it's all going well 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.669
 I reviewed my diet 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.080
 welcome pretty much everything I 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.120
 had to actually review in a nutshell 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.110
 and yeah I'm motivated I get 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.820
 many, many, many messages 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.229
 to be behind him a little 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.449
 parenthesis because I take it back my 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:07.990
 facebook page a facebook page how 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:08.949
 his possession 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.940
 in fact thanks to the little video bowl that 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:11.169
 had a lot of lay people on this page 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.120
 So it's a little rebooster you see 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.990
 so the description you could light 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.190
 the facebook page it would actually 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.360
 huge because in fact she is 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.009
 outright delay compared to all 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.520
 these georgia have what twitch ensures in 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:20.470
 the stream 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.659
 I have 54 on twitter because the case on 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.800
 youtube I have 3500 on facebook 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:26.139
 the old my facebook page it's a bit 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.880
 like the lame duck you see this kind 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.460
 when I look at my networks like them 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.000
 other networks they are like that my page 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.510
 Facebook 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.850
 she is like that to her mother 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.410
 damn so here I received a lot 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.210
 messages but has even made 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.350
 recognize by people that I 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.580
 knew in real life who did not 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.760
 did not know what I was doing and who would 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.950
 said you 're even going outside kind 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.240
 I had then go out twice then 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.680
 box finally not exactly lame 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:55.080
 evening and it's people who made me 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.790
 not you there the big one in the video tivoli 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.580
 jay payton and there oh yes yes it's me 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.380
 it's me he asks lots of questions 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.550
 it smells so cute because in fact that 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.600
 do not diverge what people are 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.980

 changed you will see it and anyway to 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.020
 because of this video already I find myself 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.070
 in a situation where I can not do 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.630
 not change the case of the evidence you have 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.680
 in the video she is timeless 

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.940
 that is, she will still be there in 

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.380
 one year in two years in three years except 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.910
 some to this crime of the blow the 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.800
 Besides, what is it that you 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:15.540

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:17.520

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.270
 because the factor is not passed there 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.949
 suggested my package I can not believe 

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.479
