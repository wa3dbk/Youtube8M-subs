00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
mean usually a linebacker makes this

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.870 
mean usually a linebacker makes this
mini<00:01:49.380> tablets<00:01:49.829> but<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.250> were<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.369> defensive

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
mini tablets but you were a defensive

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.280 
mini tablets but you were a defensive
back<00:01:51.090> well<00:01:51.450> that's<00:01:51.659> what<00:01:51.810> happens<00:01:51.899> when<00:01:52.170> you

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
back well that's what happens when you

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.560 
back well that's what happens when you
play<00:01:52.380> with<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.649> Jets<00:01:52.890> oh<00:01:53.390> that's<00:01:54.390> what

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
play with the Jets oh that's what

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.240 
play with the Jets oh that's what
happens<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.200> reason<00:01:55.500> why<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.860> happens

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
happens and the reason why that happens

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.700 
happens and the reason why that happens
is<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.430> we<00:01:56.939> really<00:01:57.119> didn't<00:01:57.509> have<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:58.500> type

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
is that we really didn't have the type

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.280 
is that we really didn't have the type
of<00:01:58.740> defense<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.490> had<00:01:59.790> with<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.420> 49ers<00:02:01.079> so

went to the Jets it was very difficult
it<00:02:18.910> was<00:02:19.000> difficult<00:02:19.239> because<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:20.110> didn't<00:02:20.560> have

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
it was difficult because I didn't have

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.470 
it was difficult because I didn't have
the<00:02:20.920> type<00:02:21.160> of<00:02:21.190> talent<00:02:21.520> that<00:02:21.819> you<00:02:21.849> need<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.300> have

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
defensive team and that allowed me to

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.900 
defensive team and that allowed me to
make<00:02:27.760> more<00:02:27.940> tackles<00:02:28.390> but<00:02:28.599> I<00:02:28.750> paid<00:02:29.110> for<00:02:29.170> it<00:02:29.880> no<00:02:30.880> I
