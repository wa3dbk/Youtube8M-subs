00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.730 
I'm twisting this strand backwards and
I'm<00:01:39.180> going<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.420> wrap<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.600> around<00:01:39.869> my<00:01:40.079> curling

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
I'm going to wrap it around my curling

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.859 
I'm going to wrap it around my curling
iron<00:01:41.450> going<00:01:42.950> forwards<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.420> you<00:01:45.420> kind<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.689> want

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
iron going forwards and you kind of want

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.859 
iron going forwards and you kind of want
to<00:01:45.899> keep<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.740> end<00:01:46.950> off<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.820> just<00:01:48.600> because

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
to keep the end off of it just because

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.149 
to keep the end off of it just because
you<00:01:49.020> want<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.290> end<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.590> be<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.770> little<00:01:49.979> bit

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
you want the end to be a little bit

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.880 
you want the end to be a little bit
straighter<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.939> don't<00:01:51.659> pull<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.020> directly<00:01:52.619> to

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
straighter and don't pull it directly to

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.889 
straighter and don't pull it directly to
your<00:01:52.979> route<00:01:53.280> see<00:01:54.000> how<00:01:54.149> I've<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:54.479> kind<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.780> got

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
your route see how I've just kind of got

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.020 
your route see how I've just kind of got
that<00:01:55.079> middle<00:01:55.530> part<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:57.590> this<00:01:58.590> section<00:01:59.130> that's

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
that middle part of this section that's

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.240 
that middle part of this section that's
going<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.390> create<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.840> really<00:02:01.170> nice<00:02:01.350> wave<00:02:01.649> look

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
going to create a really nice wave look

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.170 
going to create a really nice wave look
for<00:02:02.610> you

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.180 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.460 

so<00:02:09.180> it's<00:02:09.390> going<00:02:09.540> to<00:02:09.600> stay<00:02:09.840> twisted<00:02:10.320> together

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
so it's going to stay twisted together

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.050 
so it's going to stay twisted together
until<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.040> run<00:02:11.280> your<00:02:11.460> fingers<00:02:11.790> through<00:02:11.820> it

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
until you run your fingers through it

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.210 
until you run your fingers through it
but<00:02:12.270> when<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.630> do<00:02:12.840> it's<00:02:13.290> going<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.010> create

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
but when you do it's going to create

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.970 
but when you do it's going to create
this<00:02:14.550> awesome<00:02:15.150> look<00:02:15.540> that's<00:02:16.440> kind<00:02:16.710> of<00:02:16.770> just

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
this awesome look that's kind of just

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.790 
this awesome look that's kind of just
loose<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:18.090> know<00:02:18.210> really<00:02:18.630> fun<00:02:18.990> so<00:02:19.740> I'm

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
loose and you know really fun so I'm

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.990 
loose and you know really fun so I'm
going<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:20.040> do<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.220> same<00:02:20.370> thing<00:02:20.580> on<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.820> side

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
going to do the same thing on the side

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.140 
going to do the same thing on the side
and<00:02:21.150> twisting<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:22.860> hair<00:02:22.890> backwards<00:02:24.230> and

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
and twisting the hair backwards and

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:37.460 
and twisting the hair backwards and
curling<00:02:27.350> forwards<00:02:35.000> if<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.810> twist<00:02:37.230> it

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
curling forwards if you twist it

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.890 
curling forwards if you twist it
backwards<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.610> you<00:02:38.730> curl<00:02:39.030> backwards<00:02:39.570> that

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
backwards and you curl backwards that

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.390 
backwards and you curl backwards that
twice<00:02:40.230> just<00:02:40.470> going<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.770> kind<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.070> unravel

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
twice just going to kind of unravel

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.730 
twice just going to kind of unravel
itself<00:02:42.000> on<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.480> curling<00:02:42.900> iron<00:02:43.020> so<00:02:43.350> you<00:02:43.470> really

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
itself on the curling iron so you really

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.910 
itself on the curling iron so you really
want<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:43.980> make<00:02:44.100> sure<00:02:44.180> that<00:02:45.180> your<00:02:45.330> curling

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
want to make sure that your curling

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.020 
want to make sure that your curling
opposite<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.100> direction<00:02:47.250> that<00:02:47.730> you're

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
opposite the direction that you're

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.340 
opposite the direction that you're
twisting<00:02:48.540> that<00:02:48.720> stranded<00:02:49.320> I<00:02:51.080> don't<00:02:52.080> know<00:02:52.200> why

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
twisting that stranded I don't know why

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.699 
twisting that stranded I don't know why
it<00:02:52.410> does<00:02:52.740> that<00:02:52.770> but<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:53.880> just<00:02:53.970> does<00:02:54.560> see<00:02:55.560> this

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
it does that but it just does see this

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.610 
it does that but it just does see this
is<00:02:55.890> going<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.130> be<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.280> really<00:02:56.520> nice<00:02:56.850> wave<00:02:57.560> ok<00:02:58.560> so

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
is going to be a really nice wave ok so

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.800 
is going to be a really nice wave ok so
this<00:02:59.010> section<00:02:59.490> is<00:02:59.640> done<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.330> I'm<00:03:00.510> just<00:03:00.690> going

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
this section is done and I'm just going

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.470 
this section is done and I'm just going
to<00:03:00.900> leave<00:03:01.140> it<00:03:01.170> like<00:03:01.440> this<00:03:01.470> until<00:03:02.209> I'm<00:03:03.209> done

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
to leave it like this until I'm done

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.870 
to leave it like this until I'm done
with<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.780> rest<00:03:03.990> of<00:03:04.170> my<00:03:04.410> hair<00:03:04.760> because<00:03:05.760> you

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
with the rest of my hair because you

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.030 
with the rest of my hair because you
want<00:03:08.880> to<00:03:08.970> keep<00:03:09.150> them<00:03:09.420> in<00:03:09.660> their<00:03:09.840> form<00:03:10.230> as<00:03:10.860> long

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
want to keep them in their form as long

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.000 
want to keep them in their form as long
as<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:11.310> can<00:03:11.550> before<00:03:11.760> you<00:03:12.000> break<00:03:12.239> it<00:03:12.390> up<00:03:12.920> so<00:03:13.920> I'm

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
as you can before you break it up so I'm

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.130 
as you can before you break it up so I'm
just<00:03:14.220> going<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.430> take<00:03:14.610> some<00:03:14.670> more<00:03:15.150> hair<00:03:15.930> down

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
just going to take some more hair down

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:30.230 
just going to take some more hair down
from<00:03:16.440> each<00:03:16.560> side<00:03:21.110> resection<00:03:22.110> and<00:03:22.440> back<00:03:22.620> up

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.790 

so<00:03:31.240> we've<00:03:31.540> got<00:03:31.750> this<00:03:31.870> really<00:03:32.110> nice<00:03:32.380> wavy

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
so we've got this really nice wavy

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.070 
so we've got this really nice wavy
pattern<00:03:33.370> which<00:03:34.090> when<00:03:34.270> we<00:03:34.300> separate<00:03:34.870> it's

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
pattern which when we separate it's

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.040 
pattern which when we separate it's
going<00:03:35.260> to<00:03:35.320> be<00:03:35.410> really<00:03:35.680> soft<00:03:36.070> and<00:03:36.690> really<00:03:37.690> nice

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
going to be really soft and really nice

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.590 
going to be really soft and really nice
the<00:03:38.440> trick<00:03:38.740> with<00:03:38.920> this<00:03:39.100> is<00:03:39.400> that<00:03:39.640> you<00:03:40.360> don't

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
the trick with this is that you don't

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.010 
the trick with this is that you don't
want<00:03:40.990> to<00:03:41.610> have<00:03:42.610> a<00:03:42.640> lot<00:03:42.880> of<00:03:42.910> texture<00:03:43.540> or<00:03:43.780> a<00:03:43.810> lot

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
want to have a lot of texture or a lot

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.710 
want to have a lot of texture or a lot
of<00:03:44.140> crunch<00:03:44.500> this<00:03:44.800> is<00:03:44.950> really<00:03:45.160> more<00:03:45.490> of<00:03:45.720> soft

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
of crunch this is really more of soft

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.520 
of crunch this is really more of soft
and<00:03:47.340> loose<00:03:48.630> so<00:03:49.630> you<00:03:49.720> want<00:03:49.930> to<00:03:50.020> keep<00:03:50.140> that<00:03:50.350> in

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
and loose so you want to keep that in

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.950 
and loose so you want to keep that in
mind<00:03:50.770> when<00:03:51.610> it<00:03:51.670> comes<00:03:51.940> to<00:03:52.090> your<00:03:52.210> product<00:03:52.450> stay

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:52.960 
mind when it comes to your product stay

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.900 
mind when it comes to your product stay
away<00:03:53.170> from<00:03:53.280> something<00:03:54.280> that<00:03:54.490> has<00:03:54.670> a<00:03:54.700> lot<00:03:54.880> of

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
away from something that has a lot of

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.540 
away from something that has a lot of
texture<00:03:55.600> to<00:03:55.780> it<00:03:55.810> a<00:03:56.050> lot<00:03:56.140> of<00:03:56.320> crunch<00:03:57.280> to<00:03:57.520> it

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
texture to it a lot of crunch to it

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.710 
texture to it a lot of crunch to it
something<00:03:57.760> that's<00:03:58.000> going<00:03:58.120> to<00:03:58.180> make<00:03:58.330> your<00:03:58.510> hair

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
something that's going to make your hair

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.800 
something that's going to make your hair
a<00:03:58.930> little<00:03:59.470> bit<00:03:59.590> harder<00:04:00.100> you<00:04:00.400> don't<00:04:00.610> want<00:04:00.910> to

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810
