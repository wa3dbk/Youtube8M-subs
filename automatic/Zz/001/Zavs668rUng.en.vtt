00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.690
 then the last maximum of the series 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.850
 acoustics that is part of the family 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.540
 of the three is that we are seeing is the e go 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.880
 series that from what I understand is a 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.230
 series so called because each model 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.430
 reflects the features they have 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.050
 made famous a polo shape the chef of the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.880
 guitar and where you obviously i 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.920
 projected your vision with respect to 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.570
 that shape you want to explain to us a little 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.910
 characteristics of each of these 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.180
 these meat then look at the shape of is 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.640
 what most famous because the stars 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.870
 so the year played is not the form of the era 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.829
 what seems more logical then 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.450
 what we put it like 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.809
 features bands funds 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:52.410
 rosewood the top and in la spruce 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:55.200
 scale is 648 and the nat is 46 mm and we have 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.879
 the as usual if this is 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.829
 rosewood rosewood there 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.699
 we also find here and this is called 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.519
 star because the stars actually play 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.749
 those as I wanted to think of 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.479
 the name of this guitar is called 

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:11.429
 icon because for me the icons therefore me 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.229
 think of the guitar you see 

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:16.889
 in clapton's arms we can say 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.509
 this thing and therefore to a triple zero 

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:19.950
 and so instead in this case what 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.289
 we are thinking of a triple zero that 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.549
 we have sitka fascia fonda instead are i 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.009
 they move and therefore we have reflection 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.999
 also mahogany here all learning on that 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.399
 plus 3 distinguishes the series as well as the 

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:35.609
 sunburst is handmade so no too 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.380
 these are not reimbursed inside 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:39.149
 at sea a guitar 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.649
 particularly accurate of the whole series 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.599
 also the one that costs a little more 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.389
 but it is particularly taken care of from the point of 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:47.880
 constructive view and therefore instead 

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:50.369
 the other one we shake parlor 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.020
 call legend because I wanted to 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.700
 think of the legends here are not 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.159
 robert johnson that we associate 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.630
 this type of shape is a parlor that 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.149
 but with a fourteenth attack 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.950
 button and in this case it's all mahogany 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.869
 therefore own mahogany bands bottom in 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.330
 know and that looks like a woman of 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.060
 mahogany family e 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.790
 and therefore this completes the family 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:16.470
 of the ego with its name therefore star aicon 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.630
 and legend and are of the say in the part 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.160
 of the catalog named with the number 3 is 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.460
 the one that goes to conclude this part 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.460
 of the catalog
