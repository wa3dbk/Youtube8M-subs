00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
plays and kind of like I don't know I

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.569 
plays and kind of like I don't know I
guess<00:00:55.050> dissect<00:00:55.739> his<00:00:55.949> gameplay<00:00:56.780> so<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.840> say<00:00:58.079> and

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
guess dissect his gameplay so to say and

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.180 
guess dissect his gameplay so to say and
yeah<00:00:59.579> so<00:00:59.960> first<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.109> all<00:01:01.170> as<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.649> can<00:01:01.829> see<00:01:02.010> he

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
yeah so first of all as you can see he

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.609 
yeah so first of all as you can see he
is<00:01:02.219> using<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.699> fully<00:01:03.059> automatic<00:01:03.449> FAL<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.260> believe

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
is using a fully automatic FAL I believe

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.090 
is using a fully automatic FAL I believe
this<00:01:04.830> was<00:01:05.040> post<00:01:05.400> patch<00:01:05.670> after<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.210> patch<00:01:06.420> so

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
this was post patch after the patch so

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.230 
this was post patch after the patch so
I'm<00:01:08.100> not<00:01:08.159> sure<00:01:08.430> though<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.640> could<00:01:08.970> be<00:01:09.090> wrong

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
I'm not sure though I could be wrong

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.390 
I'm not sure though I could be wrong
mistaking<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:09.900> because<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:10.920> from<00:01:11.340> a

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
mistaking that because this is from a

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.609 
mistaking that because this is from a
little<00:01:11.610> bit<00:01:11.700> ago<00:01:11.790> but<00:01:12.090> he<00:01:12.689> still<00:01:12.930> did<00:01:12.990> ham<00:01:13.409> with

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
little bit ago but he still did ham with

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.539 
little bit ago but he still did ham with
it<00:01:13.770> whether<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.610> was<00:01:14.729> patched<00:01:15.000> or<00:01:15.210> not<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:16.549> his

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
it whether it was patched or not and his

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.130 
it whether it was patched or not and his
scorestreaks<00:01:18.060> setup<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.780> stealth

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
scorestreaks setup is the stealth

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.679 
scorestreaks setup is the stealth
chopper<00:01:19.560> orbital<00:01:19.890> vsat<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.460> lodestar<00:01:21.030> which

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
chopper orbital vsat and lodestar which

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.820 
chopper orbital vsat and lodestar which
is<00:01:22.280> surprisingly<00:01:23.299> pretty<00:01:24.299> low<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.500> mean

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
is surprisingly pretty low I mean

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.020 
is surprisingly pretty low I mean
compared<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.460> all<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.610> hundred-plus

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
with these scorestreaks so and that's

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.859 
with these scorestreaks so and that's
one<00:01:35.490> thing<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.729> wanted<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:35.970> talk<00:01:36.150> about<00:01:36.210> which<00:01:36.720> I

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
one thing I wanted to talk about which I

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.230 
one thing I wanted to talk about which I
will<00:01:37.020> go<00:01:37.170> into<00:01:37.380> more<00:01:37.530> detail<00:01:38.250> sorry<00:01:39.090> about

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
will go into more detail sorry about

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.359 
will go into more detail sorry about
that<00:01:39.270> I'll<00:01:39.780> go<00:01:40.020> into<00:01:40.170> more<00:01:40.259> detail<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:41.189> a

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
that I'll go into more detail in a

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.609 
that I'll go into more detail in a
separate<00:01:41.670> video<00:01:41.820> but<00:01:42.299> use<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.140> score<00:01:43.409> streaks

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
separate video but use the score streaks

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.149 
separate video but use the score streaks
that<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.890> can<00:01:44.040> get<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:45.350> seeing<00:01:46.350> as<00:01:46.619> he<00:01:47.009> did

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
that you can get and seeing as he did

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.469 
that you can get and seeing as he did
pretty<00:01:47.340> low<00:01:47.549> score<00:01:47.820> streak<00:01:47.970> he<00:01:48.119> still<00:01:48.329> went

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
pretty low score streak he still went

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.020 
pretty low score streak he still went
100<00:01:48.960> plus<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.250> can<00:01:50.399> still<00:01:50.610> happen<00:01:50.640> without

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
100 plus so it can still happen without

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.420 
100 plus so it can still happen without
having<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.689> use<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.020> swarm<00:01:52.320> into<00:01:52.530> dogs<00:01:52.770> so

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430

get<00:03:29.760> that<00:03:29.909> first<00:03:30.150> score<00:03:31.049> streak<00:03:31.319> which<00:03:31.970> will

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
get that first score streak which will

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.750 
get that first score streak which will
ultimately<00:03:33.239> help<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:34.049> you<00:03:34.829> know<00:03:34.949> get<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:35.489> the

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
ultimately help you you know get to the

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.159 
ultimately help you you know get to the
next<00:03:35.940> score<00:03:36.209> streak<00:03:36.449> and<00:03:36.599> then<00:03:36.690> to<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.870> next

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
next score streak and then to the next

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.530 
next score streak and then to the next
score<00:03:37.379> streak<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:37.919> if<00:03:38.730> you're<00:03:38.879> using<00:03:39.180> a

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
score streak and if you're using a

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.930 
score streak and if you're using a
orbital<00:03:40.319> vsat<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:40.919> you<00:03:40.980> get<00:03:41.099> that<00:03:41.220> vsat<00:03:41.639> real

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
orbital vsat and you get that vsat real

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.909 
orbital vsat and you get that vsat real
quick<00:03:42.120> in<00:03:42.269> a<00:03:42.329> first<00:03:42.540> part<00:03:42.720> of<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.870> game<00:03:43.019> then<00:03:43.560> I

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
quick in a first part of the game then I

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.759 
quick in a first part of the game then I
mean<00:03:44.659> you<00:03:45.659> know<00:03:45.810> it's<00:03:46.079> going<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.349> be<00:03:46.440> good<00:03:46.590> from

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
mean you know it's going to be good from

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.589 
mean you know it's going to be good from
there<00:03:46.919> because<00:03:47.280> once<00:03:47.819> you<00:03:47.879> ever<00:03:48.000> be<00:03:48.150> set<00:03:48.359> up<00:03:48.479> it

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
there because once you ever be set up it

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:49.909 
there because once you ever be set up it
should<00:03:48.629> be<00:03:48.780> no<00:03:48.900> problem<00:03:48.930> to<00:03:49.319> kill<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.650> enemy

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
should be no problem to kill the enemy

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:53.180 
should be no problem to kill the enemy
and<00:03:50.510> should<00:03:51.510> be<00:03:51.629> rather<00:03:51.810> easy<00:03:52.190> especially

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
and should be rather easy especially

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.069 
and should be rather easy especially
because<00:03:53.699> then<00:03:53.879> you<00:03:54.180> can<00:03:54.299> just<00:03:54.479> hide<00:03:54.870> behind

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
because then you can just hide behind

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.110 
because then you can just hide behind
certain<00:03:55.379> things<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:56.010> oh<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.790> speaking<00:03:57.000> of

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
certain things and oh and speaking of

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.089 
certain things and oh and speaking of
that<00:03:57.239> don't<00:03:57.479> don't<00:03:58.139> be<00:03:58.229> stupid<00:03:58.620> don't<00:03:58.680> when

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
that don't don't be stupid don't when

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.890 
that don't don't be stupid don't when
you<00:03:59.190> get<00:03:59.310> a<00:03:59.340> visa<00:03:59.519> don't<00:03:59.940> rush<00:04:00.180> in<00:04:00.329> there<00:04:00.510> like

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
you get a visa don't rush in there like

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.250 
you get a visa don't rush in there like
blind<00:04:01.620> going<00:04:02.190> in<00:04:02.459> random<00:04:03.000> spots<00:04:03.030> just<00:04:03.720> wait

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
blind going in random spots just wait

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.199 
blind going in random spots just wait
for<00:04:04.470> them<00:04:04.560> to<00:04:04.590> come<00:04:04.829> to<00:04:05.040> you<00:04:05.159> I<00:04:05.220> mean<00:04:05.549> sometimes

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
for them to come to you I mean sometimes

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.059 
for them to come to you I mean sometimes
it's<00:04:06.510> hard<00:04:06.659> to<00:04:06.690> do<00:04:06.810> that<00:04:06.959> because<00:04:07.109> you're<00:04:07.409> your

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
it's hard to do that because you're your

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.680 
it's hard to do that because you're your
teammate<00:04:08.400> likes<00:04:08.669> to<00:04:08.819> mooch<00:04:09.000> off<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.329> vsat

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
teammate likes to mooch off the vsat

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.979 
teammate likes to mooch off the vsat
kills<00:04:09.959> but<00:04:10.260> you<00:04:10.680> know<00:04:10.829> it'll<00:04:11.489> happen<00:04:11.729> and<00:04:12.090> once

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
kills but you know it'll happen and once

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.479 
kills but you know it'll happen and once
again<00:04:13.139> like<00:04:13.440> he's<00:04:13.560> doing<00:04:13.769> right<00:04:13.859> here<00:04:13.919> as<00:04:14.280> you

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
again like he's doing right here as you

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.240 
again like he's doing right here as you
can<00:04:14.519> see<00:04:14.639> he<00:04:15.569> sees<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:15.870> UAV<00:04:16.229> and<00:04:16.409> he<00:04:17.070> knows

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
can see he sees the UAV and he knows

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.409 
can see he sees the UAV and he knows
that<00:04:17.280> they're<00:04:17.579> coming<00:04:17.820> for<00:04:17.909> the<00:04:18.000> headquarter

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
that they're coming for the headquarter

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.409 
that they're coming for the headquarter
so<00:04:18.630> he<00:04:19.440> goes<00:04:19.590> and<00:04:19.650> cuts<00:04:20.639> the<00:04:20.789> route<00:04:20.970> off<00:04:21.150> and

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
so he goes and cuts the route off and

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.360 
so he goes and cuts the route off and
kills<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.169> enemies

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
kills the enemies

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.060 
kills the enemies
let's<00:04:23.970> talk<00:04:24.180> about<00:04:24.300> perk<00:04:24.690> setups<00:04:25.080> for<00:04:25.320> if

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
let's talk about perk setups for if

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.290 
let's talk about perk setups for if
you're<00:04:26.160> going<00:04:26.310> trying<00:04:26.669> to<00:04:26.729> get<00:04:26.820> 100<00:04:27.150> plus

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
you're going trying to get 100 plus

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.180 
you're going trying to get 100 plus
gameplays<00:04:27.720> or<00:04:28.020> even<00:04:28.590> just<00:04:28.620> hi<00:04:28.919> Katie

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
gameplays or even just hi Katie

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.400 
gameplays or even just hi Katie
gameplays<00:04:29.699> for<00:04:30.690> your<00:04:30.780> first<00:04:30.990> Park<00:04:31.290> you

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
gameplays for your first Park you

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.770 
gameplays for your first Park you
definitely<00:04:31.979> want<00:04:32.160> to<00:04:32.190> be<00:04:32.340> using<00:04:32.699> two<00:04:32.940> in<00:04:33.240> my

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
definitely want to be using two in my

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.659 
definitely want to be using two in my
opinion<00:04:34.080> I<00:04:34.350> mean<00:04:34.530> it<00:04:34.710> can<00:04:34.860> obviously<00:04:35.160> happen

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
opinion I mean it can obviously happen

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:36.920 
opinion I mean it can obviously happen
but<00:04:35.850> it<00:04:35.970> will<00:04:36.090> be<00:04:36.120> more<00:04:36.419> likely<00:04:36.600> to<00:04:36.750> happen

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
but it will be more likely to happen

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.189 
but it will be more likely to happen
when<00:04:37.229> you<00:04:37.320> have<00:04:37.470> to<00:04:39.050> there's<00:04:40.050> two

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
when you have to there's two

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:41.390 
when you have to there's two
alternatives<00:04:40.710> if<00:04:40.800> you're<00:04:40.949> going<00:04:41.070> for<00:04:41.250> high

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
alternatives if you're going for high

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.590 
alternatives if you're going for high
score<00:04:41.820> streaks<00:04:42.210> use<00:04:43.080> ghost<00:04:43.800> and<00:04:46.460> hardline

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
score streaks use ghost and hardline

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.090 
score streaks use ghost and hardline
because<00:04:48.600> you<00:04:49.110> know<00:04:49.229> score<00:04:49.740> streaks<00:04:49.979> are

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
because you know score streaks are

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.100 
because you know score streaks are
fairly<00:04:50.370> difficult<00:04:51.060> to<00:04:51.389> get<00:04:51.510> in<00:04:51.600> this<00:04:51.690> game<00:04:51.870> you

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
fairly difficult to get in this game you

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.170 
fairly difficult to get in this game you
know<00:04:52.199> like<00:04:52.440> I<00:04:52.949> don't<00:04:53.310> know<00:04:53.490> what's<00:04:53.880> a<00:04:53.970> score

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
know like I don't know what's a score

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.520 
know like I don't know what's a score
streak<00:04:54.419> that<00:04:54.600> there<00:04:54.810> I<00:04:54.840> know<00:04:55.050> there's<00:04:55.229> one<00:04:55.350> for

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
streak that there I know there's one for

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.029 
streak that there I know there's one for
1600<00:04:56.130> points<00:04:56.310> so<00:04:56.970> that<00:04:57.000> 16<00:04:57.840> kills<00:04:58.260> in<00:04:58.470> a<00:04:58.530> row<00:04:58.560> or

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
1600 points so that 16 kills in a row or

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:00.680 
1600 points so that 16 kills in a row or
you<00:04:59.970> know<00:05:00.090> if<00:05:00.180> you're<00:05:00.270> playing<00:05:00.419> the<00:05:00.600> objective

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
you know if you're playing the objective

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.710 
you know if you're playing the objective
mode<00:05:01.289> like<00:05:01.800> domination<00:05:02.729> or<00:05:02.820> headquarters<00:05:03.449> for

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
mode like domination or headquarters for

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.330 
mode like domination or headquarters for
example<00:05:04.139> then<00:05:04.620> you<00:05:04.680> need<00:05:04.830> to<00:05:04.919> get<00:05:05.039> some<00:05:05.190> points

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
example then you need to get some points

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.529 
example then you need to get some points
off<00:05:05.580> the<00:05:05.820> objective<00:05:06.510> plus<00:05:06.780> your<00:05:07.440> kills<00:05:07.680> so<00:05:08.160> and

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
off the objective plus your kills so and

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.159 
off the objective plus your kills so and
hardline<00:05:09.539> I'll<00:05:09.660> drop<00:05:09.840> that<00:05:10.050> down<00:05:10.229> I<00:05:10.560> believe

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
hardline I'll drop that down I believe

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.870 
hardline I'll drop that down I believe
100<00:05:13.169> points<00:05:13.500> but<00:05:13.620> I'm<00:05:13.680> not<00:05:13.830> sure<00:05:13.860> because<00:05:14.580> it

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
100 points but I'm not sure because it

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.189 
100 points but I'm not sure because it
usually<00:05:15.000> drops<00:05:15.419> it<00:05:15.600> and<00:05:15.630> they<00:05:15.870> all<00:05:15.960> the<00:05:16.080> other

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
usually drops it and they all the other

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:17.930 
usually drops it and they all the other
games<00:05:16.380> that<00:05:16.530> would<00:05:16.680> drop<00:05:16.800> it<00:05:16.979> from<00:05:17.070> 21<00:05:17.729> less

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
games that would drop it from 21 less

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.850 
games that would drop it from 21 less
kill<00:05:18.180> so<00:05:18.449> one<00:05:18.990> less<00:05:19.110> kill<00:05:19.320> on<00:05:19.410> this<00:05:19.530> game<00:05:19.680> is<00:05:19.830> a

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
kill so one less kill on this game is a

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.010 
kill so one less kill on this game is a
hundred<00:05:20.160> points<00:05:20.340> so<00:05:20.669> it's<00:05:21.120> probably<00:05:21.389> 100

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
hundred points so it's probably 100

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.860 
hundred points so it's probably 100
points<00:05:22.350> and<00:05:23.130> if<00:05:23.250> you're<00:05:23.430> just<00:05:23.550> going<00:05:24.270> for<00:05:24.510> hi

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870

my<00:06:45.960> opinion<00:06:46.139> on<00:06:46.410> the<00:06:46.500> perks<00:06:46.910> and<00:06:47.910> once<00:06:48.180> again

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 
my opinion on the perks and once again

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.600 
my opinion on the perks and once again
those<00:06:48.599> are<00:06:48.630> just<00:06:48.990> it's<00:06:49.680> just<00:06:49.770> my<00:06:50.009> opinion<00:06:50.490> on

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610 
those are just it's just my opinion on

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.820 
those are just it's just my opinion on
stuff<00:06:51.120> I<00:06:51.300> mean<00:06:51.479> it's<00:06:51.630> obviously<00:06:52.110> possible<00:06:52.710> as

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:52.830 
stuff I mean it's obviously possible as

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.469 
stuff I mean it's obviously possible as
you're<00:06:52.979> seeing<00:06:53.130> here<00:06:53.400> without<00:06:53.550> two<00:06:53.970> perks<00:06:54.240> and

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 
you're seeing here without two perks and

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:55.779 
you're seeing here without two perks and
stuff<00:06:54.630> like<00:06:54.750> that<00:06:54.810> so<00:06:55.110> if<00:06:55.199> you<00:06:55.289> want<00:06:55.470> to<00:06:55.530> use

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:55.789 
stuff like that so if you want to use

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:59.300 
stuff like that so if you want to use
c4s<00:06:56.789> or<00:06:56.940> grenades<00:06:57.330> then<00:06:57.720> go<00:06:57.990> right<00:06:58.169> ahead<00:06:58.310> in

00:06:59.300 --> 00:06:59.310 
c4s or grenades then go right ahead in

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.930 
c4s or grenades then go right ahead in
