okay<00:00:02.280> we're<00:00:02.460> going<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.610> see<00:00:02.850> how<00:00:02.939> fast<00:00:03.270> the<00:00:03.540> new

00:00:03.849 --> 00:00:03.859 
okay we're going to see how fast the new

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:09.169 
okay we're going to see how fast the new
Pentax<00:00:04.859> flashes<00:00:05.400> are<00:00:05.549> I<00:00:05.839> got<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:07.020> k3<00:00:07.970> set<00:00:08.970> to

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
Pentax flashes are I got the k3 set to

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.780 
Pentax flashes are I got the k3 set to
one<00:00:09.540> one<00:00:09.690> sixtieth<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.320> second<00:00:10.769> this<00:00:11.610> is

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
one one sixtieth of a second this is

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.529 
one one sixtieth of a second this is
here<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.330> is<00:00:12.420> without<00:00:12.690> any<00:00:13.049> flash<00:00:13.290> on<00:00:13.500> it

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.590 

ts<00:00:18.539> come<00:00:18.750> pretty<00:00:18.930> fast<00:00:20.090> first<00:00:21.090> we'll<00:00:21.270> put<00:00:21.420> on

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
ts come pretty fast first we'll put on

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.620 
ts come pretty fast first we'll put on
the<00:00:22.640> smaller<00:00:23.640> flash<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:25.580> have<00:00:26.630> 360

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
the smaller flash this is the a have 360

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.799 
the smaller flash this is the a have 360
fgz<00:00:28.230> -<00:00:29.960> we're<00:00:30.960> going<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.140> set<00:00:31.289> this<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.619> manual

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
fgz - we're going to set this in manual

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.479 
fgz - we're going to set this in manual
and<00:00:33.809> first<00:00:34.380> we'll<00:00:34.590> try<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.920> full<00:00:35.579> power<00:00:37.489> I'm

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
and first we'll try a full power I'm

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.889 
and first we'll try a full power I'm
going<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.730> take<00:00:38.879> ten<00:00:39.090> shots<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.660> we'll<00:00:39.719> see

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
going to take ten shots and we'll see

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:48.020 
going to take ten shots and we'll see
how<00:00:40.050> many<00:00:40.110> flash<00:00:40.559> as<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.890> gets<00:00:46.370> so<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.610> got<00:00:47.820> two

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
how many flash as it gets so I got two

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.100 
how many flash as it gets so I got two
flashes<00:00:48.480> off<00:00:50.480> and<00:00:51.480> we'll<00:00:51.600> change<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.960> to

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
flashes off and we'll change that to

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:13.080 
flashes off and we'll change that to
half<00:00:52.500> power<00:00:52.770> now<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:59.930> was<00:01:00.930> four

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:24.279 

lost<00:01:14.090> count<00:01:14.360> things<00:01:14.600> my<00:01:14.869> half<00:01:15.079> oh<00:01:23.200> that<00:01:24.200> was

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
lost count things my half oh that was

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:26.789 
lost count things my half oh that was
one<00:01:24.470> eighth<00:01:24.649> power<00:01:24.920> and<00:01:25.399> that<00:01:25.640> was<00:01:25.820> every

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
one eighth power and that was every

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.520 
one eighth power and that was every
everyone<00:01:27.799> flashed<00:01:29.020> so<00:01:30.020> he<00:01:30.140> reasonably

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
everyone flashed so he reasonably

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.399 
everyone flashed so he reasonably
assumed<00:01:30.860> any<00:01:31.070> of<00:01:31.189> the<00:01:31.250> slower<00:01:31.520> speeds<00:01:32.409> 1:16

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
assumed any of the slower speeds 1:16

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.880 
assumed any of the slower speeds 1:16
32nd<00:01:34.189> 64th<00:01:34.759> white<00:01:35.720> on<00:01:35.899> the<00:01:35.990> one<00:01:36.140> 256

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
32nd 64th white on the one 256

fractional<00:01:38.049> they're<00:01:39.049> all<00:01:39.170> gonna<00:01:39.610> flash<00:01:40.610> every

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
fractional they're all gonna flash every

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.109 
fractional they're all gonna flash every
shot<00:01:41.179> for<00:01:41.390> ten<00:01:41.569> shots<00:01:42.670> let's<00:01:43.670> try<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:43.909> bigger

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
shot for ten shots let's try the bigger

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.039 
shot for ten shots let's try the bigger
one<00:01:46.360> so<00:01:47.360> it's<00:01:47.479> important<00:01:47.720> to<00:01:47.750> understand

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
one so it's important to understand

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:49.539 
one so it's important to understand
these<00:01:48.200> are<00:01:48.350> fractional<00:01:48.799> powers<00:01:49.159> and<00:01:49.369> since

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
these are fractional powers and since

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.779 
these are fractional powers and since
the<00:01:49.670> very<00:01:49.850> ones<00:01:50.060> is<00:01:50.179> more<00:01:50.360> powerful<00:01:50.950> I<00:01:51.950> would

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
the very ones is more powerful I would

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.620 
the very ones is more powerful I would
expect<00:01:53.330> it<00:01:53.509> to<00:01:53.659> take<00:01:53.840> longer<00:01:54.110> to<00:01:54.259> recharge<00:01:55.630> but

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
expect it to take longer to recharge but

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.499 
expect it to take longer to recharge but
keep<00:01:56.810> in<00:01:56.929> mind<00:01:57.170> that<00:01:57.380> one<00:01:57.619> the<00:01:57.770> one<00:01:58.209> power<00:01:59.209> on

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
keep in mind that one the one power on

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.240 
keep in mind that one the one power on
this<00:01:59.659> one<00:01:59.929> is<00:02:00.110> it's<00:02:00.409> gonna<00:02:00.560> be<00:02:00.649> a<00:02:00.799> lot<00:02:00.950> bigger

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
this one is it's gonna be a lot bigger

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.620 
this one is it's gonna be a lot bigger
first<00:02:01.610> if<00:02:01.939> you<00:02:02.030> didn't<00:02:02.360> say<00:02:03.289> half<00:02:03.530> power<00:02:03.770> here

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
first if you didn't say half power here

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.400 
first if you didn't say half power here
it'll<00:02:05.630> be<00:02:05.750> about<00:02:05.929> the<00:02:05.990> same<00:02:06.229> as<00:02:06.289> the<00:02:06.470> smaller

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
it'll be about the same as the smaller

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.979 
it'll be about the same as the smaller
okay<00:02:09.410> so<00:02:09.500> we're<00:02:10.060> set<00:02:11.060> up<00:02:11.090> right<00:02:11.420> and<00:02:11.450> manual

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
okay so we're set up right and manual

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.490 
okay so we're set up right and manual
we're<00:02:12.739> going<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:12.980> try<00:02:13.450> again<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.959> ten<00:02:15.230> shots

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
we're going to try again the ten shots

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.990 
we're going to try again the ten shots
outside<00:02:20.620> so<00:02:21.620> I<00:02:21.650> just<00:02:21.890> got<00:02:22.069> the<00:02:22.160> first<00:02:22.430> shot<00:02:22.640> off

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
outside so I just got the first shot off

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.849 
outside so I just got the first shot off
with<00:02:23.299> flash<00:02:25.780> that's<00:02:26.780> a<00:02:26.930> lot<00:02:27.079> of<00:02:27.109> power<00:02:27.440> on<00:02:27.620> one

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:27.859 
with flash that's a lot of power on one

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:30.360 
with flash that's a lot of power on one
to<00:02:28.010> one<00:02:28.190> you<00:02:28.220> know<00:02:28.459> do<00:02:28.819> I<00:02:29.000> need<00:02:29.209> that<00:02:29.239> much

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
to one you know do I need that much

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.960 
to one you know do I need that much
here's<00:02:31.370> half<00:02:31.579> power

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
here's half power

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:40.940 
here's half power
I<00:02:35.859> got<00:02:36.859> to<00:02:37.069> you<00:02:37.130> in<00:02:37.160> there

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:51.800 

here's<00:02:41.950> one<00:02:42.130> quarter

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:03:02.780 

that<00:02:52.350> finish<00:02:52.710> loading<00:02:52.920> here's<00:02:53.280> one<00:02:53.430> a<00:03:01.790> little

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
that finish loading here's one a little

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:11.530 
that finish loading here's one a little
over<00:03:02.970> half<00:03:03.180> of<00:03:03.270> a<00:03:03.360> think<00:03:03.570> and<00:03:03.720> we'll<00:03:03.900> try<00:03:04.110> 16th

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.130 

if<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:12.720> got<00:03:12.840> every<00:03:13.110> single<00:03:13.500> one<00:03:13.620> there<00:03:13.800> a<00:03:13.830> flash

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
if I got every single one there a flash

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.590 
if I got every single one there a flash
so<00:03:16.140> get<00:03:16.380> anything<00:03:16.880> anything<00:03:17.880> it<00:03:18.090> less<00:03:18.330> power

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
so get anything anything it less power

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.410 
so get anything anything it less power
than<00:03:18.780> that<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:19.170> we'll<00:03:19.970> keep<00:03:20.970> up<00:03:21.180> pretty<00:03:21.330> well

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
than that and we'll keep up pretty well

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.209 
than that and we'll keep up pretty well
with<00:03:21.570> the<00:03:21.690> camera<00:03:21.870> so<00:03:23.000> there<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.090> have<00:03:24.120> it
