00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
time and everything is factored into the

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.140 
time and everything is factored into the
price<00:02:29.930> this<00:02:30.620> is<00:02:30.680> a<00:02:30.829> remix<00:02:31.220> it<00:02:31.790> was<00:02:31.910> another

something<00:02:35.780> different<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.230> it<00:02:36.319> so<00:02:36.410> I<00:02:36.470> want<00:02:36.650> to

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
something different to it so I want to

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.410 
something different to it so I want to
turn<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:37.010> into<00:02:37.129> like<00:02:37.400> a<00:02:37.430> flat<00:02:37.760> screen<00:02:38.090> star

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420
