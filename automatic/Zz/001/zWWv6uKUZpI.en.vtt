00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
the problem

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.970 
the problem
sadly<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.340> problem<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:39.050> the<00:00:40.050> vibration<00:00:40.829> in

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
sadly the problem is the vibration in

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.729 
sadly the problem is the vibration in
the<00:00:41.010> ps4<00:00:41.399> controller<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.510> terrible<00:00:43.170> beyond

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
the ps4 controller it is terrible beyond

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:52.880 
the ps4 controller it is terrible beyond
belief<00:00:44.840> like<00:00:46.550> okay<00:00:47.550> wait<00:00:48.320> autofocus<00:00:49.320> or<00:00:51.890> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
belief like okay wait autofocus or the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.610 
belief like okay wait autofocus or the
vibration<00:00:53.430> in<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.449> ps4

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
vibration in this the ps4

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.209 
vibration in this the ps4
it<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.730> beyond<00:00:57.510> terrible<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> worst

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
it is beyond terrible it is the worst

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.400 
it is beyond terrible it is the worst
level<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.969> vibration<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.750> have<00:01:00.870> felt<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.350> a

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
level of vibration I have felt in a

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.990 
level of vibration I have felt in a
controller<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.190> while<00:01:03.320> like<00:01:04.670> on<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.700> scale

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
controller in a while like on a scale

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.730 
controller in a while like on a scale
one<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.420> ten<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.630> gave<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:06.990> like<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> three<00:01:07.530> or

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
one to ten I gave it like a three or

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.240 
one to ten I gave it like a three or
four<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.580> feeling<00:01:09.500> now<00:01:10.500> compare<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.040> to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
four in the feeling now compare that to

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.969 
four in the feeling now compare that to
the<00:01:11.490> DualShock<00:01:12.000> 3<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.780> would<00:01:13.500> give<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.950> a

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
the DualShock 3 I would give that a

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.749 
the DualShock 3 I would give that a
about<00:01:14.430> it's<00:01:14.580> good<00:01:15.000> 6<00:01:15.689> maybe<00:01:16.350> like<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.220> good<00:01:17.460> six

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
about it's good 6 maybe like a good six

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.120 
about it's good 6 maybe like a good six
out<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.030> vibration<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.860> ps2<00:01:19.860> controller

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
out of vibration the ps2 controller

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.010 
out of vibration the ps2 controller
which<00:01:20.850> aren't<00:01:21.119> those<00:01:21.270> ones<00:01:21.630> those<00:01:21.990> are

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
which aren't those ones those are

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.120 
which aren't those ones those are

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
vibration and the ps4 controller sucks

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.920 
vibration and the ps4 controller sucks
really<00:02:04.829> bad<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.610> that's<00:02:06.329> all<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.630> need<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.869> tell
