I bit of that sometimes mobile phone
kind<00:03:11.400> of<00:03:11.460> thing<00:03:11.700> that<00:03:11.730> enables<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.540> mass<00:03:12.720> riders

kind of thing that enables a mass riders

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.800 
kind of thing that enables a mass riders
to<00:03:13.260> transform<00:03:13.860> another<00:03:14.460> belts<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.510> all<00:03:15.660> of

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
to transform another belts and all of

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.150 
to transform another belts and all of
them<00:03:15.930> have<00:03:15.960> some<00:03:16.320> kind<00:03:16.500> of<00:03:16.530> symbol<00:03:16.800> that<00:03:17.070> you

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
them have some kind of symbol that you

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.370 
them have some kind of symbol that you
put<00:03:17.370> into<00:03:17.490> them<00:03:17.790> for<00:03:18.690> instance<00:03:18.900> these<00:03:19.140> are

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
put into them for instance these are

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.560 
put into them for instance these are
more<00:03:19.560> kind<00:03:19.860> of<00:03:19.980> symbol<00:03:20.460> kind<00:03:20.670> of<00:03:20.910> they<00:03:21.450> look

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
more kind of symbol kind of they look

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.380 
more kind of symbol kind of they look
like<00:03:21.750> SD<00:03:22.050> cards<00:03:22.710> but<00:03:22.980> their<00:03:23.220> gain<00:03:23.550> will<00:03:23.910> slot

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
like SD cards but their gain will slot

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.060 
like SD cards but their gain will slot
into<00:03:24.600> something<00:03:25.140> they'll<00:03:25.350> enable<00:03:25.590> someone<00:03:25.980> to

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
into something they'll enable someone to

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.730 
into something they'll enable someone to
transform<00:03:26.840> these<00:03:27.840> are<00:03:28.230> this<00:03:28.380> is<00:03:28.470> what<00:03:28.620> they

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
transform these are this is what they

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.010 
transform these are this is what they
slot<00:03:28.980> into<00:03:29.300> it's<00:03:30.300> a<00:03:30.510> kind<00:03:30.840> of<00:03:31.430> I<00:03:32.810> don't<00:03:33.810> know

of things and when they slot into them
then<00:04:07.860> presumably<00:04:08.160> they<00:04:08.760> transform<00:04:09.420> into<00:04:09.630> a

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
then presumably they transform into a

with flash memory that's locked into it

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.700 
with flash memory that's locked into it
and<00:04:16.290> so<00:04:16.560> since<00:04:17.340> days<00:04:17.820> of<00:04:17.970> old<00:04:18.170> that's<00:04:19.170> such<00:04:19.470> as
