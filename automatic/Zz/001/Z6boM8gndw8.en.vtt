00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 hello how it is gm as Wednesday hello 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.670
 how about this Wednesday with name of matus 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.920
 and makeup but this time I will not 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.509
 a make up a few videos and I think 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.130
 which was two or three months ago 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.230
 months because I left a lot of time 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.289
 serve you here I made the first hairstyle 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.570
 easy and in total they are like 10 and this time 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.150
 and I will make at least one weekly the 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.099
 second is for when your hair is a 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.179
 disaster like that and you do not really see 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:33.600
 so bad but I have 10 19 the hair is 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.190
 dirty there's no way to ripple and 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.829
 iron it or nothing because I have it 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.020
 red and I can only iron it and 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.000
 all that when I just washed them 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.649
 I will teach something very simple to 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.850
 rescue him 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.530
 this is the first thing I'm going to do 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.960
 although this Aryan option was what I have 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.879
 the hair quite dirty but if you're 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.920
 without washing you do not need it I'm going to 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.989
 use a dry shampoo this is the 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.850
 shampoo if it's already happened to me that I use the 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.739
 Talc for skin instead of shampoo 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.969
 because the rates are the same but if 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.370
 you're in the shampoo - what I'm going to 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.060
 to do is to throw him in the roots is 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.229
 mentally it does not matter in final 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.790
 they have to be cared for you can not be 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.240
 Damn it because we're going to 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.240
 collect 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.430
 there is no do not be on the big trips 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.450
 let me put the other side and that part 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.969
 simply revenues 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.920
 seriously that's one of my actions 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:27.539
 wounds that is not a secret beginning 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.920
 by the eyebrows I try to make them look 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.789
 similar but you looked I got here 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.829
 you are here 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.810
 Now let's take here is where more 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.219
 is going to see then the problem is that 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.560
 if in fact where I split the 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:41.060
 hair as it is greasy sometimes it 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.060
 it looks white there it seems 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.950
 I do not want it to look 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.370
 after you got enough of everything 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.510
 what you have to do is like this 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.840
 until you see all that white a 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.840
 bit 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.770
 now it does not seem that we have 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.840
 solved a lot we got a 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.000
 secret more only than in people and 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.860
 It feels dry all the way, assuming 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.270
 that in series the world and now we are going 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.459
 with the end because that's where I 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.550
 would divide normally and if indeed 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.590
 would normally look like this because I do not know 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.690
 they will create but I will never only comb 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.209
 as it is around here for this part more 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.620
 high eyebrows I will do as a 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.970
 path then you have to get up 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.560
 back because we're only going to 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.970
 use up here good I'm going to do 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.650
 the braid for carl I'm going to take this 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.560
 piece 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.360
 a pretty long weight and there I do the 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.220
 first part of the braid what I'm going to 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.040
 to do is a French braid only 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.829
 I'm not going to take two strips but 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.629
 only on but to begin with 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.030
 If you take all three without using make a 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.829
 French holding do not worry I'll 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.620
 I'm explaining this piece of that the 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:03:02.189
 back I'm going to go under in 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.790
 in front of a braid others only 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:06.340
 I moved twice 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.109
 now again I'm going to take a little 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.819
 up back but not as far back as 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:14.609
 it suits 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.609
 from here but be thin 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.630
 now I have other pieces that also in 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.150
 this case 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:26.080
 and I only add it forward if zidane 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.210
 August exchange only twice and this 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.430
 third of here is going to be a little bit more 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.980
 way down but still 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.370
 thin good that's why a little 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.370
 ad 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.140
 t 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.490
 now the three strips should have 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.400
 enough hair now will not stay 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.440
 as a thick and two very thin but 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.300
 what's more even for you from here 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.250
 down I'm just going to add a 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.280
 little bit of hair that only for 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.140
 Keep the braid stuck like this 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.100
 I'm taking a little more 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.980
 so you add it in front 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.890
 cross or this one 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.900
 and now it's even below it adds 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.590
 other 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.740
 that is very thin it went under 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.350
 this 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.150
 and now this also protects now what 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.040
 what you have to do is finish the press 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.750
 like a normal braid I keep going 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.310
 Otherwise, they can also do it 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.380
 up but for some reason 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.980
 I always like more how they are and why 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.340
 under 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.350
 if you like you can add a little piece 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.450
 because an elastic band I do not know how 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.460
 called because in reality rubber does not 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.650
 I know why I did it in cauchiles other 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.450
 that's why they are very cheap 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.460
 They are tiny and come in packages like 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.520
 say you can leave it as you can 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.870
 put it like that since the honey brushes are going 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.069
 to arrive 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.069
 and that's easy 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.620
 it's good that it tastes easy or what I 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:55.419
 I always do is good, I have two 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.039
 versions so here I finish my braids 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:00.360
 as the part that was then 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.360
 lift your hair from here 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.090
 and here he fastened it so that only 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.000
 see me this printed part is like 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.010
 I really have bad hair because what 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.020
 I want to have picked up what I'm going to 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.210
 take more back and then what 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.650
 I will go doing is raise a part 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.650
 behind and there the gap 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.190
 is delivered good 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.450
 do not 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.030
 and that's how good it is, is that 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.400
 dare the hooks and in my defense 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.960
 always have the membership card and the 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.150
 sacred because when you're clean 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.130
 unearthed are repaired at least in me 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.110
 I am separated now the reason why 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:47.320
 this hairstyle so simple that I no longer 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:50.860
 it's cool not even a minute to be born and if I 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.960
 I could do something drunk in a concert 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.250
 where he had no mirror or anything and 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.330
 I only did it because I was 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.390
 stressed out and I wanted it to be over 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.830
 because 9 born you can do what 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.450
 necessary after they learn they can 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.790
 doing it in a minute is so strong that 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.110
 This hairstyle is so simple and is for 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.290
 when you have your hair done 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.750
 disaster is because it depends on the level of 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.370
 disaster that you get the hair if 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.230
 only in this part that of whom 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.420
 first it is replenished that you can do me 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:18.820
 this and that this is fine if you have 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.830
 something around here that you do not like you can 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.110
 welcome you the numbers pick up the but 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.450
 imagine that it is picked up or if seriously 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.520
 you have terrible this part also 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:32.050
 is terrible can make you one like 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:35.430
 is here and you make a tomato then 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.430
 but we would be one like that 

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.570
 only that you would look better 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.730
 that to me because I have never seen 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:46.130
 Obviously from the ear picked up the ear 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.020
 and that's it was like the simple hairstyle 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.910
 so that there was sold in less than 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.340
 five minutes I'll leave you here a 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.600
 playlist with the videos with 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.960
 the easy hairstyles that I've done up 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.940
 Now that they left, it has only been one but 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.370
 I will keep uploading this by the way and 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.530
 remember that I have an account on twitter and 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:06.110
 also the facebook page and 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:08.660
 instagram that recently believes it then 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:11.450
 remember to follow me there I do not get excited 

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:13.280
 much the idea to do outfit of the day 

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:16.160
 because although it would take me so long 

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.900
 doing it here it's up to me how power is 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.430
 the illumination the illumination my fourth 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:24.070
 it's terrible then 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:26.320
 better I took some pictures of something with 

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:29.890
 a color and upload it instagram if you want 

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:33.540
 30 days and see things so yeah that's 

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:37.050
 all a kiss until the next video 

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:38.670
 also today I'm not going very woman or 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:41.910
 normalized to tell him this is not 

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:45.200
 out of focus so perfect 

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:47.860
 this is what you want to tell me 

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.860
 it does not matter
