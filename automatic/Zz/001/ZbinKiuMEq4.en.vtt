00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:03.180
 i 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.860
 well we are great in downtown 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.540
 I'm in a life of 12 that the truth is not 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.830
 I know why he chose one of 12 and I know 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.869
 perfectly how to believe then later 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:28.369
 but let's see try not to fall 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:31.590
 value it newer than you can because 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.870
 I am very bad oceans more demand I am not 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.629
 I am the following bad or is very bad and 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.070
 using crops for nothing and I take away the 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.830
 blocks new gm what he did is the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:46.469
 third floor that are I think seven I think 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:48.149
 that you do not know how many floors you know 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.320
 how many floors are you can tell me 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.070
 please in the comments that really 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.250
 I do not know I do not know 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.530
 really and I do not know how many floors there in 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.520
 total but to see this one I like 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.010
 because we are less 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.640
 good are fewer people who are 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.340
 on the map and I 'm going well and good 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.170
 they die slower but it's easier 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.320
 that you stand on podium 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.689
 but I'm bad and I do not consider myself so 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.229
 bad but I mean we say 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:26.979
 commenting and doing this is very difficult or 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:30.840
 really be that is, and I'm in the last 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:34.320
 layer and I removed blocks or that already 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.170
 then more complicated to last 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.840
 It is a respectable time because I 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.660
 I give you grief, there are 4 players left 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.310
 that I have not noticed when his players 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.730
 are left so we can stay in podium 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.440
 let's continue on his podium 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.880
 good if we had been able to 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.830
 I would have been happy but good 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.390
 We were on the podium but we stayed in 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.120
 a respectable place truth that yes is 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.710
 true that yes ok we are in the sand that 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.290
 so much we wanted and so many talking in the 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.500
 last game that was the arena of 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.510
 24 people the very big arena of 24 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.210
 people but in which everyone falls out of 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.670
 a milestone in the blink of an eye and 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.850
 let's hope that what ends up deciding me 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.160
 happen to me , I really want, I want 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:20.030
 stay in the last 3 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.770
 therefore a respectable place and very 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.040
 respectable truth truth that I hope that 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.420
 yes true yes ok we are going to choose and 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.010
 consult by decade in the sector 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.500
 I must let go in front and it will drop 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.200
 from behind ok and we accept here and 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.920
 live pee dad pam pam pim pam ok 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.500
 then to see I want to stay all 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.730
 the time here and stay ok and not anymore 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.060
 we do not stay all the time in the 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.190
 top layer staying we wanted to know 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.270
 in English they are only three layers so 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:55.310
 you have to be careful three or four 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:58.280
 3,434 layers 50 44 4 4 2 and 4 do not fall 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:02.060
 please ok I do not know yo I'm not me no 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.800
 I know how to throw away people 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.090
 blocks but I already learned to use this 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.890
 function and no longer use them ok then 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.390
 your team and nothing I fall the last 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.290
 layer and I fell wow 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:19.110
 ok after my scream so precious and what 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.540
 after both merit juice 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.020
 we are finally going to play 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.750
 Miralles and we will not leave us 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.640
 large sands let's use use let's go 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.459
 play for tiny little games 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.959
 ok why why why do I like not 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.120
 the little ones come out now 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.340
 changed my decision yes yes we like 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.450
 the small sands ok 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:46.230
 let's jump jump jump and I fall 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.540
 I fall I fall are 10 layers I think 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.820
 right now I counted them but I think 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.530
 my calculations are going to fail and I hope that 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.019
 tell me how many layers are because 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.500
 then it will not stay with the wedding and I do not know 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:02.760
 if you pass them let's say 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.860
 they say a good thing rather they want 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.330
 say one thing who no longer organize my 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:12.180
 ideas and then you fall to the last 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:15.130
 layer not good and I'm saying they say 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.630
 one thing and then 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.810
 and I do not know what I'm saying they mean 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:25.490
 one thing but no longer when they are going to 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:27.710
 say in English interrupts and then 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.400
 when you can talk or whatever 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:34.430
 When you have already remembered, you are returned to 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.190
 forget and then with just come back forget 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.750
 you get sad and then you say better 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.970
 and all forget about that but in reality 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.420
 you're not thinking anymore and that just 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.250
 happen right now and I'm sad about that 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.250
 because it's really very bad, it's not 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:52.070
 very bad but depressing good to me 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.710
