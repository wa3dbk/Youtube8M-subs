 he made one big factory is another 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.330
 fantastic job said no 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.769
 waste this company here to come to 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.430
 miss a 160 families coming to 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.430
 not having work 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:37.820
 you want to talk about her civil part of the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:41.490
 malaguti is damage to the country 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:46.580
 I certainly read a little about it 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.580
 newspaper however the slight bone 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.910
 now I see that he works in a moment 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:27.520
 feed care at another company 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:31.020
 that you remember being here from 96 97 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.270
 with the advent of f 12 there was a boom 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.780
 scary from 100 thousand scooters and step 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.690
 per year 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.690
 then suddenly the carousel stopped 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.130
 is called has made is the new 50 scooter 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.910
 marabottini madison malaguti difficile 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.910
 leave 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.190
 for us, malaguti has always been like 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.050
 our second family 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.320
 they have always behaved a lot 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.940
 good with us 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:13.650
 about 17 years 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.570
 I 20 years old I've been working here ever since 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.090
 spare parts last year I spent here 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.160
 on the assembly line and now I am 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.620
 helping the company to dismantle that 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.540
 that is inside 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.140
 that practically there is almost nothing 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.819
 except some machinery and giving 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.510
 what is possible in exchange rates 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:35.180
 we'll start nava history again though 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:39.129
 at the beginning it was very tragic tragic 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.349
 sad affair because we failed 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:46.250
 probably to spend all 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:48.530
 capacity let's say mobilizations that in 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.140
 these cases we can spend is 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.470
 a company that has always been managed 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.970
 family is part of that capitalism 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:02.000
 Bolognese family also in a sector 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:04.190
 where the crisis is heavy because also in 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.390
 these last nine months there is a decline in the 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.909
 16 percent 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.829
 if we take some countries we are around 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:12.620
 at 30 percent on the scooter in 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:15.260
 particular however it was a company that 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:19.400
 it had a brand and therefore a product 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:23.900
 it also had solidity 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.790
 financial and therefore could have had 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.290
 alternatives to closure 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.290
 but it didn't happen that way 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.590
 I no no no no from my observatory 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:46.040
 enough elements to point the finger 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.470
 against anyone and that what I say 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.550
 it is evident that there is a state of 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.940
 despondency of resignation because 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:58.430
 probably on the motorcycle sector 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.530
 it could be done at national level a 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.170
 Different reasoning is clear that the 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.500
 entrepreneurial choice was born not yesterday 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:09.650
 not the day before yesterday but in short, it is born 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.959
 a little while ago when the property 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.030
 seeing numbers in hand the situation of the 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:17.959
 I repeat this choice from the market 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.250
 of sale of sale or otherwise 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.709
 of progressive closure 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.180
 I mean there are so many contributing factors 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:28.960
 together they created the problem 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.940
 of the malaguti crisis surely 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.310
 most likely wrong choices of 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:38.290
 market but also the state of it 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:40.820
 screwed completely on the motorcycle 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:44.240
 this crisis that brought the people to their knees 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:47.570
 suppliers and therefore also us i 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.820
 workers together union have 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.710
 tried in every way to put on 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.419
 a straight or even speak well 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.970
 of worker cooperatives that 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.620
 they could detect it as far as the sea 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.630
 a production cycle 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.139
 everyone tried to put some of himself 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.940
 just driven by the sense of belonging 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:08.000
 this company 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.570
 and this I can tell everyone at all 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.120
 levels 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.580
 today, however, we take note with one 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.009
 condition which is like saying 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:21.689
 objectively there on the table 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:24.089
 and the state of things is this union 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:26.999
 can do anything but cannot sign a 

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:29.159
 agreement which provides for redundancies to 

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:32.099
 end the money for those who want to leave it 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:34.199
 himself will be there because he will do the 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:36.930
 individual transactions but not there 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:38.969
 the agreement because on the closure 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.629
 of the company there can be no agreement 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:44.789
 the true fact is that it is the territory that 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:47.669
 failed to keep this reality 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:50.550
 open productive family thought 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:53.069
 his interests and full of money e 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:56.129
 keep making money because I don't think so 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:59.189
 that the mark if it will hold it in a 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:06:00.449
 motorcycle sector drawer is dead 

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:04.259
 from here in Italy you can not really anymore 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:06.449
 do nothing with this state that has 

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:09.289
 let the motorcycle die because in 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:12.749
 emilia romagna aside sees mopeds 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:14.129
 no one is seen, no I am anymore 

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:16.459
 angry with the state than with i 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:16.459
 malaguti
