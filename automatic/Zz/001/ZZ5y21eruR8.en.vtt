00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
angle than one thing for this there you

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.649 
angle than one thing for this there you
are<00:01:25.520> what's<00:01:26.520> gonna<00:01:26.640> happen<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.360> you're<00:01:27.900> gonna

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
are what's gonna happen is you're gonna

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.780 
are what's gonna happen is you're gonna
be<00:01:30.659> trying<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.110> change<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:32.009> blade<00:01:32.250> angle<00:01:32.700> and

be trying to change the blade angle and

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.760 
be trying to change the blade angle and
it<00:01:32.850> will<00:01:33.000> eventually<00:01:33.240> sharpen<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.960> knife<00:01:34.140> but

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
it will eventually sharpen the knife but

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.620 
it will eventually sharpen the knife but
it's<00:01:34.890> gonna<00:01:35.009> take<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> very<00:01:35.729> long<00:01:36.030> time<00:01:36.390> there

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
it's gonna take a very long time there

something with a different blade angle

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.249 
something with a different blade angle
this<00:01:47.820> sharpened<00:01:48.270> right<00:01:48.420> up<00:01:48.600> even<00:01:48.869> after<00:01:48.960> all

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259
