00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:13.040
 how to evaluate your apartment 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.660
 we will not sell in this case 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.369
 consider how to do it 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.020
 professional appraisers are important to us 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.460
 precisely the market value which 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.240
 will allow us to sell an apartment in 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.539
 a certain period and there is enough 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.300
 many mistakes the first is when people 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:31.460
 go to the real estate portal are watching 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.350
 similar options and 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.950
 think about how much can 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.870
 cost an apartment in a similar condition 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.630
 about the same place here 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.070
 the main caveat is that people 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.559
 see the price of the offer 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.410
 that is, this is the price at which people 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:51.530
 would like to sell your apartment and she 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.230
 often, and rather, most cases are not 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.140
 corresponds to the purchase price, that is, if 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.200
 present it schematically then it will be 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.110
 look like this there are 10 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.930
 wanting to sell their apartment for the price 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.930
 example starting there from 5 million to 10 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.700
 we take the same type of apartments and below we 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.920
 Imagine people who are ready to buy 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.040
 similar apartments and they start 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:19.130
 let's say there 3 million to 6 million 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.930
 here on the crosshair here and committed 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.659
 all transactions that is a person who 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.630
 put his apartment for 78 million 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.330
 he may never sell her mind 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.869
 the fact that demand and transactions are made 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.270
 somewhere around 5-6 million 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.700
 although in real 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.850
 and it turns out a very funny thing that 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.979
 real buyer with seller can 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.079
 here and do not cross on and find a friend 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.590
 friend that is, how is it worth 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:51.350
 come choose for yourself the most 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:55.360
 similar options and the first to do 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:58.069
 as a buyer call these options and 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.200
 try to bargain with them that is 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:02.689
 how much they can throw the price already 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.610
 even on the phone as a rule if on that 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.369
 side is not a professional seller 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.530
 then he easily makes concessions even in 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.880
 telephone conversation 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.650
 it is important to take into account still really 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.640
 corresponds to the reality of reality 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.560
 there is if you approach this 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.599
 as professional as possible 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.099
 it is certainly worth seeing these 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.079
 options i think you can even 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.560
 find an apartment in your own home 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:29.230
 and and see and already in place 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:35.650
 try to bargain this way 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.650
 the cost of your apartment is the cost 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.220
 buying value then there is something for 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.819
 how much are willing to buy real 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.819
 buyer
