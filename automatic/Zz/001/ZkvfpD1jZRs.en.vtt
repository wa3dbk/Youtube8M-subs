00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
the economy like this well we sure

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.140 
the economy like this well we sure
indirectly<00:00:21.830> they<00:00:22.160> shouldn't<00:00:22.520> stimulate<00:00:23.000> it

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
indirectly they shouldn't stimulate it

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.840 
indirectly they shouldn't stimulate it
by<00:00:23.560> interfering<00:00:24.560> in<00:00:24.710> the<00:00:24.830> market<00:00:25.640> rate<00:00:25.820> of

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:25.850 
by interfering in the market rate of

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.760 
by interfering in the market rate of
interest<00:00:26.090> that's<00:00:26.660> where<00:00:26.900> our<00:00:26.930> basic<00:00:27.440> problem

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770 
interest that's where our basic problem

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.950 
interest that's where our basic problem
comes<00:00:28.010> from<00:00:28.279> and<00:00:28.789> when<00:00:29.210> you<00:00:29.300> do<00:00:29.449> that<00:00:29.660> you<00:00:29.840> get

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
comes from and when you do that you get

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.900 
comes from and when you do that you get
into<00:00:30.199> these<00:00:30.289> problems<00:00:30.890> and<00:00:31.039> then<00:00:31.189> everybody

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
into these problems and then everybody

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.340 
into these problems and then everybody
wants<00:00:32.119> to<00:00:32.180> solve<00:00:32.390> the<00:00:32.510> problem<00:00:32.840> by<00:00:32.960> printing

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
wants to solve the problem by printing

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.200 
wants to solve the problem by printing
more<00:00:33.530> money<00:00:33.590> and<00:00:33.980> spending<00:00:34.309> more<00:00:34.489> money<00:00:34.550> and

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
more money and spending more money and

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.030 
more money and spending more money and
asking<00:00:35.600> the<00:00:35.660> federal<00:00:35.809> reserve<00:00:36.199> to<00:00:36.440> you<00:00:36.920> know

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
asking the federal reserve to you know

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.740 
asking the federal reserve to you know
lower<00:00:37.220> interest<00:00:37.610> rates<00:00:37.910> and<00:00:38.149> that<00:00:38.390> just<00:00:38.600> makes

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
lower interest rates and that just makes

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.690 
lower interest rates and that just makes
the<00:00:38.930> problem<00:00:39.140> that<00:00:39.440> much<00:00:39.649> worse<00:00:39.860> the

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
the problem that much worse the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.190 
the problem that much worse the
government<00:00:41.059> does<00:00:41.210> have<00:00:41.239> a<00:00:41.480> responsibility

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
government does have a responsibility

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.490 
government does have a responsibility
but<00:00:42.559> it's<00:00:42.710> supposed<00:00:42.980> to<00:00:43.130> lower<00:00:43.820> taxes<00:00:44.570> get<00:00:45.290> rid

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
but it's supposed to lower taxes get rid

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.760 
but it's supposed to lower taxes get rid
of<00:00:45.530> regulations<00:00:46.010> and<00:00:47.079> devise<00:00:48.079> a<00:00:48.110> monetary

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
of regulations and devise a monetary

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.680 
of regulations and devise a monetary
policy<00:00:49.219> that<00:00:49.340> makes<00:00:49.370> them<00:00:49.760> make<00:00:50.210> some<00:00:50.450> sense

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
policy that makes them make some sense

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.250 
policy that makes them make some sense
but<00:00:51.440> to<00:00:51.500> continue<00:00:52.010> to<00:00:52.460> say<00:00:52.640> that<00:00:52.850> we<00:00:53.000> just

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
but to continue to say that we just

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.350 
but to continue to say that we just
appropriate<00:00:54.260> more<00:00:54.500> money<00:00:54.770> which<00:00:55.579> is<00:00:55.940> more

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
appropriate more money which is more

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.779 
appropriate more money which is more
deficit<00:00:56.899> and<00:00:57.170> then<00:00:57.410> expect<00:00:57.890> us<00:00:58.250> either<00:00:58.460> to

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
deficit and then expect us either to

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:00.520 
deficit and then expect us either to
borrow<00:00:59.059> it<00:00:59.270> or<00:00:59.420> expect<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:00.230> Federal<00:01:00.469> Reserve

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
borrow it or expect the Federal Reserve

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.590 
borrow it or expect the Federal Reserve
to<00:01:00.890> monetize<00:01:01.399> it<00:01:01.610> it<00:01:01.879> makes<00:01:02.090> our<00:01:02.270> problems

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
to monetize it it makes our problems

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.970 
to monetize it it makes our problems
worth<00:01:02.719> just<00:01:03.110> look<00:01:03.320> at<00:01:03.440> what's<00:01:03.590> happening

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
deregulation I was one of three people

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.809 
deregulation I was one of three people
to<00:01:48.349> vote<00:01:48.500> it<00:01:48.649> against<00:01:48.950> our<00:01:49.069> veins<00:01:49.310> Oxley<00:01:49.759> I
