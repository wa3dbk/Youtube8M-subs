00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
is much smaller than his and he's

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.129 
is much smaller than his and he's
planning<00:00:08.429> on<00:00:08.550> coming<00:00:08.820> back<00:00:09.000> babies<00:00:09.690> so<00:00:09.990> I'm

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
planning on coming back babies so I'm

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.009 
planning on coming back babies so I'm
just<00:00:10.349> rebuild<00:00:10.740> in<00:00:10.860> that<00:00:11.040> same<00:00:11.340> maze<00:00:11.639> and

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:12.019 
just rebuild in that same maze and

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:14.480 
just rebuild in that same maze and
moving<00:00:13.019> right<00:00:13.139> along<00:00:13.290> 22<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:13.980> almost<00:00:14.250> finished

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
moving right along 22 is almost finished

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.269 
moving right along 22 is almost finished
my<00:00:14.849> build<00:00:15.059> is<00:00:15.500> obviously<00:00:16.500> happening<00:00:17.130> very

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
my build is obviously happening very

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.730 
my build is obviously happening very
slowly<00:00:17.550> because<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:18.750> can't<00:00:19.020> hit<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.380> normal

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
slowly because you can't hit the normal

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.099 
slowly because you can't hit the normal
benchmarks<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:20.580> when<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:20.820> lose<00:00:21.000> 50<00:00:21.840> for

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
benchmarks so when you lose 50 for

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.099 
benchmarks so when you lose 50 for
freaking<00:00:22.650> workers<00:00:23.100> but<00:00:23.820> I've<00:00:24.000> got<00:00:24.300> all<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.600> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
thinking attack he's attacking every 10

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.590 
thinking attack he's attacking every 10
seconds<00:00:32.460> if<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.730> ever<00:00:32.880> attack<00:00:33.300> you're<00:00:33.480> going

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600
