00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.029 
the way you know my body is reacting so
I<00:02:06.509> might<00:02:06.780> slow<00:02:07.020> down<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.439> not<00:02:07.530> lose<00:02:07.680> any<00:02:07.890> way

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
I might slow down and not lose any way

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.360 
I might slow down and not lose any way
for<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.429> know<00:02:08.670> six<00:02:09.000> weeks<00:02:09.649> and<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:11.160> will<00:02:11.280> be

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
for you know six weeks and that will be

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.100 
for you know six weeks and that will be
frustrating<00:02:11.970> but<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.450> know<00:02:12.780> it's

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
frustrating but you know it's

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.600 
frustrating but you know it's
one<00:02:13.410> of<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.620> things<00:02:13.740> I<00:02:13.920> got<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.130> deal<00:02:14.280> with

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.470 

over<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:21.120> next<00:02:21.330> couple<00:02:21.630> weeks<00:02:22.700> my<00:02:23.700> goal<00:02:24.000> is<00:02:24.360> to

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
over the next couple weeks my goal is to

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.290 
over the next couple weeks my goal is to
eat<00:02:27.530> like<00:02:28.530> I'm<00:02:28.710> supposed<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.310> with<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.730> diet<00:02:29.940> I

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
eat like I'm supposed to with the diet I

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.470 
eat like I'm supposed to with the diet I
felt<00:02:30.870> like<00:02:30.990> I<00:02:31.080> started<00:02:31.470> cutting<00:02:31.710> back<00:02:31.920> and

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
felt like I started cutting back and

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.810 
felt like I started cutting back and
eating<00:02:33.480> less<00:02:33.810> than<00:02:34.020> I'm<00:02:34.110> supposed<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.790> so<00:02:35.790> I

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
eating less than I'm supposed to so I

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.240 
eating less than I'm supposed to so I
could<00:02:36.030> lose<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.390> weight<00:02:36.920> that's<00:02:37.920> not<00:02:38.100> the

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
could lose the weight that's not the

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.980 
could lose the weight that's not the
right<00:02:38.340> way<00:02:38.520> to<00:02:38.580> do<00:02:38.820> it<00:02:38.970> what<00:02:39.240> I've<00:02:39.360> noticed<00:02:39.600> is

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
right way to do it what I've noticed is

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.850 
right way to do it what I've noticed is
I'll<00:02:40.680> starve<00:02:41.070> myself<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:42.290> not<00:02:43.290> eat<00:02:43.530> meals

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
I'll starve myself and not eat meals

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.440 
I'll starve myself and not eat meals
like<00:02:44.100> I'm<00:02:44.250> supposed<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.580> every<00:02:44.850> three<00:02:45.060> day<00:02:45.209> or
