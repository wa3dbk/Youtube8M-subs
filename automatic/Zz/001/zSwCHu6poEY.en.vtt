00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.940 
sacked I started using this play because
he<00:01:51.390> was<00:01:51.570> started<00:01:51.930> passing<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.680> he's

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
he was started passing and he's

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.100 
he was started passing and he's
desperate<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.549> score<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.479> with<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.720> passing

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
desperate to score and with the passing

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.590 
desperate to score and with the passing
attack<00:01:55.439> he's<00:01:56.130> no<00:01:56.310> longer<00:01:56.490> running<00:01:56.820> what<00:01:57.570> I

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
attack he's no longer running what I

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.420 
attack he's no longer running what I
like<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.960> do<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.500> take<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.920> long<00:01:59.100> side<00:01:59.310> of

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
like to do is to take the long side of

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.859 
like to do is to take the long side of
the<00:01:59.520> few<00:01:59.729> away<00:02:00.000> from<00:02:00.210> him<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.600> put<00:02:00.780> the

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
the few away from him and put the

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.660 
the few away from him and put the
pressure<00:02:01.110> through<00:02:01.500> there<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.979> make<00:02:02.520> them

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
pressure through there and make them

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
went to the short side because he has

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.789 
went to the short side because he has
less<00:02:04.950> options<00:02:05.630> this<00:02:06.630> play<00:02:06.899> also<00:02:07.290> helps<00:02:07.560> you're

three-quarter defense and the quarter

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.300 
three-quarter defense and the quarter
defense<00:02:36.040> can<00:02:36.340> be<00:02:36.489> really<00:02:36.819> effective<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:38.310> this

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
defense can be really effective and this

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.760 
defense can be really effective and this
is<00:02:39.489> like<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:40.450> random<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:40.959> stopper<00:02:41.470> in<00:02:41.739> the
