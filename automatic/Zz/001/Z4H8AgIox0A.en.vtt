size small and I think if you're in
between<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.360> small<00:01:51.659> medium<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.770> small

Secret<00:03:13.190> leather<00:03:13.430> jacket<00:03:14.209> and<00:03:14.480> then<00:03:14.720> my

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
Secret leather jacket and then my

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:16.930 
Secret leather jacket and then my
Rebecca<00:03:15.590> mica<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:16.099> of<00:03:16.280> course<00:03:16.489> just<00:03:16.640> paired

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940

it with some plain black pumps and I

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.490 
it with some plain black pumps and I
think<00:03:19.190> this<00:03:19.430> transfers<00:03:20.299> look<00:03:20.630> into<00:03:21.110> more<00:03:21.319> of<00:03:21.380> a

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
think this transfers look into more of a

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:32.059 
think this transfers look into more of a
nighttime<00:03:21.890> look

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.920 

next<00:03:33.069> up<00:03:33.190> I<00:03:33.370> have<00:03:33.400> this<00:03:33.940> really<00:03:34.390> fun<00:03:34.690> life

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
next up I have this really fun life

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.830 
next up I have this really fun life
stressed<00:03:35.350> it<00:03:35.590> is<00:03:36.040> sleeveless<00:03:36.459> and<00:03:37.060> then<00:03:37.750> it

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
stressed it is sleeveless and then it

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.960 
stressed it is sleeveless and then it
has<00:03:38.050> zipper<00:03:38.800> going<00:03:39.130> all<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.370> way<00:03:39.459> on<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:39.730> back

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
has zipper going all the way on the back

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.940 
has zipper going all the way on the back
but<00:03:40.209> what<00:03:40.360> is<00:03:40.480> so<00:03:40.870> awesome<00:03:41.080> about<00:03:41.410> this<00:03:41.590> dress

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
but what is so awesome about this dress

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.309 
but what is so awesome about this dress
is<00:03:42.190> the<00:03:42.400> fringe<00:03:42.760> at<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.150> bottom<00:03:43.510> I<00:03:43.750> think

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
is the fringe at the bottom I think

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.199 
is the fringe at the bottom I think
that's<00:03:44.470> so<00:03:44.740> unique<00:03:44.980> and<00:03:45.310> I<00:03:45.790> did<00:03:45.940> get<00:03:46.090> the

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
that's so unique and I did get the

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.210 
that's so unique and I did get the
synthesized<00:03:46.660> small<00:03:46.900> this<00:03:47.050> is<00:03:47.110> very<00:03:47.470> fitted<00:03:47.920> so

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
synthesized small this is very fitted so

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.920 
synthesized small this is very fitted so
I<00:03:48.520> mean<00:03:48.730> currently<00:03:49.270> right<00:03:49.450> now<00:03:49.480> I<00:03:49.600> probably

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
I mean currently right now I probably

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.040 
I mean currently right now I probably
should<00:03:50.260> have<00:03:50.350> gone<00:03:50.530> with<00:03:50.590> a<00:03:50.800> medium<00:03:51.310> but<00:03:51.670> um

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
should have gone with a medium but um

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.650 
should have gone with a medium but um
again<00:03:53.050> saving<00:03:53.470> it<00:03:53.680> for<00:03:53.920> you<00:03:54.310> know<00:03:54.550> when<00:03:55.480> I<00:03:55.600> get

those ones and I'm like oh I got a local
boutique<00:07:25.319> and<00:07:25.560> then<00:07:25.770> you<00:07:25.979> can't<00:07:26.219> even<00:07:26.460> get<00:07:26.639> a

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:26.669
