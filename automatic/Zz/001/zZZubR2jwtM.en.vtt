00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
lost in the stereo of the one punch I

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.610 
lost in the stereo of the one punch I
could<00:03:24.450> say<00:03:24.570> halfway<00:03:24.960> through<00:03:25.170> that<00:03:25.200> fight

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620

around<00:03:25.830> rounds<00:03:26.430> four<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:26.790> five<00:03:26.970> I<00:03:27.300> thought

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
around rounds four and five I thought

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.720 
around rounds four and five I thought
that's<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.440> best<00:03:28.770> version<00:03:29.040> of<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.490> pac-man

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.510 
and in terms of this performance against
Marquez<00:03:34.230> who<00:03:34.440> I<00:03:34.500> thought<00:03:34.740> really<00:03:34.980> neutralized

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
Marquez who I thought really neutralized
