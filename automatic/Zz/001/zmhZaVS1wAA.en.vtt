 We here from the goldsmiths for 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:26.039
 asia sports and i need it one 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.789
 sip coffee friends because we dare 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.070
 us 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.090
 we'll start today maybe 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.340
 most important but also one of the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.250
 most comprehensive article on ezios ports 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.340
 to discuss a bit and in video 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.050
 format for you prefer 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.070
 spectator 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.079
 and of course, if you are deep then 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.600
 you want to read cross-cutting information 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.629
 the below linked article and it will 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:56.160
 go around the eleven big biggest lies 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:59.100
 and myths of mainstream nutrition and 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.219
 we start with a year steady 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:09.000
 companion every fitness athlete is there 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:11.400
 I'm sure that hardly a 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.090
 myth love friends in nutrition 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.030
 holds as much as the statement 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.280
 Eggs are unhealthy sometimes, maybe 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.409
 still there are too many eggs 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.610
 unhealthy it is about saying yes 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.189
 chicken egg evening, of course, a proper 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.939
 portion fed that is fact almost in 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.970
 ratio one to one to one of eight 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.229
 each speak approximately 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.990
 and that's for the very important 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.150
 The topic of fat comes in the second lie 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.040
 then again to wear here as 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.100
 small outlook mentioned it works 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.110
 especially the so-called cholesterol 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.320
 we have people all cholesterol 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.200
 we need is essentially produced 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.380
 even our own 20 to 25 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.200
 percent of the need for cholesterol 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.070
 Our liver produces it now 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.140
 that we have different types of cholesterol 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.720
 in our body have the so-called 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.910
 HDL and LDL cholesterol 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.610
 now there are the claims that just 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.790
 accordingly, an impact on ours 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.480
 Have cholesterol and thus too 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.410
 can lead to diseases 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.209
 For example, LDL cholesterol is used 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:28.180
 inflammatory, so to speak invented 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:31.130
 have in our body thus can 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.740
 Usury breakers are at their worst 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.510
 case carcinogens will be so, yes 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.100
 already far-reaching consequences are now 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.620
 but so does the cholesterol 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.760
 Nutrition cholesterol from a chicken egg 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.760
 virtually no influence on the 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.280
 cholesterol has our blood 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.190
 ever the first dear friends and 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.070
 second, ideally, depending on whether one 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.330
 a responder or non responder is what 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.870
 now again genetic 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.269
 predisposition is even positive 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.640
 Aspects has namely the hdl 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.230
 raises cholesterol and the ldl 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.450
 cholesterol levels are a lot 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.060
 smaller and finer the ldl cholesterol 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.030
 positively influenced by the fact that 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.040
 it enlarges these and thus again 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.750
 that does not make sure they are not on 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.220
 certain places can settle and 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:21.890
 thus more on the topic of heart health 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:26.329
 So cardiovascular health contributes 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:29.829
 friends is a super wonderful 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:32.269

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.430
 of posture methods and others 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:38.329
 ethical moral aspects completely 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:41.630
 Apart from that, one is a very one 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:44.030
 healthy meal and can be natural 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.459
 Everyone also wonderfully helps his body 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.019
 to influence the composition so who the 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.930
