 here is your one day what do you eat 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.550

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.820
 so that it was and honestly that flies on so 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.970

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.040
 I hope you all think you all 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.140

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.390
 will understand from the berries la breakfast I have the most 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.469
 the most high-calorie all the hardest 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.840
 settling for breakfast in my breakfast 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:51.480
 rub what beauty 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.399
 bear teddy i love this mug i already 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.140
 so many years I personally I will be up 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.859
 old age on their share disaster no one 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.629
 break my coffee 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:04.470
 natural coffee I cook it 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.930
 and right with milk sugar free my breakfast 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.040
 the main part is such a puff 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.920
 puff with curd and raisins with bargaining raisins 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.790
 and cinnamon is my experiment I basically pk 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.950
 mastering cooking let's say it is necessary 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.250
 high-calorie one sugar there a little bit 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.250
 general such a breakfast and of course pears and neither 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.619
 I don't miss one meal 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.110
 not some kind of vegetable or fruit here 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.680
 he really like the moment give energy and 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.750
 here in a jar is sesame I already 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.780
 it was told that this is one of the best 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.640
 calcium sources for pregnant women or 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:47.159
 for or generally read it is proven that 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.950
 sesame is much more calcium than 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.259
 dairy products and so on i eat 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.090
 teaspoon sesame since i have 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:59.430
 there is even a diagnosis such as this symphysis 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.310
 I think pregnant women know problems with 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.770
 bones and so on from lack of calcium 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.869
 that is, sesame using cult each 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.730
 I already understand the day 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.170
 much more 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:14.440
 better that's all my breakfast next 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.730
 there will be lunch and in conclusion there will be dinner a 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.730
 I guess I'll just tell you 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.400
 this is my lunch let's see what's here 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.250
 it's a salad called a whisk 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.190
 raw lettuce here beet cabbage 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.650
 carrot and garlic lemon juice and a little 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.600
 butter it really tasty and very useful and 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.750
 very helpful boost hemoglobin 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.240
 clean the intestines and the topic will be useful 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.760
 losing weight pregnant is helpful due to the fact that 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:45.200
 beet and hemoglobin raises and raw 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:49.220
 vegetables are useful and loaves of bread and cheese 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.460
 a thin piece of cheese as you see 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.430
 small eat some bread that I eat 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:03:01.640
 loaves fitness 10 cereal formula and here 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:05.030
 a lot of years is enough for a long time and in general 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.610
 healthier than bread and better and better say 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.280
 so digested and digested through 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.850
 about twenty minutes after lunch I will drink 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:17.060
 tea drink green tea without sugar backs 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.680
 I love phenicia probably eat things 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.370
 two or three no more since they 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:25.310
 calories and by the way someone write off 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.459
 that this is a very poor lunch and so on i 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.530
 more precisely now 34 weeks that is 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.410
 the title of the video in thinks that probably 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.200
 less but I already like you 4 would be time 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.820
 to ease your body a little 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.060
 I already eat less 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:44.720
 not because I'm limiting myself because 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.750
 that the body itself is already rebuilt 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.720
 exactly preparing for childbirth and that is all 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.000
 It was easier and better the body more 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.400
 such food I try you not 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.110
 load especially when tight 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.510
 eat you feel worse 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.660
 insomnia begins to hurt more 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.630
 back in general, draw conclusions but here's another 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.800
 we are already writing me scientifically today I am already 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.680
 did not become yet 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.590
 serve show you straight for dinner 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.620
 I have as you see buckwheat one of mine 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.540
 most favorite groups I told him. with 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.440
 small amount of meat 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.690
 stewed meat carrot onion and pepper all 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.600
 this stew is nothing fatty and in 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.720
 Generally this whole portion as you can see here 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.750
 I will eat a little today for dinner 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:37.500
