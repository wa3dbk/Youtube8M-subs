00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
Minecraft game run faster so first thing

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.330 
Minecraft game run faster so first thing
you<00:00:18.029> need<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.270> do<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.720> find<00:00:19.230> out<00:00:19.439> how<00:00:19.830> much<00:00:20.039> RAM

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
you need to do is find out how much RAM

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.880 
you need to do is find out how much RAM
your<00:00:20.580> computer<00:00:20.970> has<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:22.439> basically<00:00:22.740> you

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
your computer has and so basically you

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.620 
your computer has and so basically you
need<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.070> go<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.460> system<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.390> your

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
need to go to the system in your

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.349 
need to go to the system in your
computer<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.590> do<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.160> hit<00:00:26.369> Windows<00:00:26.939> +

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
computer so to do that you hit Windows +

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.080 
computer so to do that you hit Windows +
X<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.740> it'll<00:00:29.220> bring<00:00:29.340> up<00:00:29.519> this<00:00:29.640> little<00:00:29.910> view

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
X and it'll bring up this little view

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.659 
X and it'll bring up this little view
right<00:00:30.240> here<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.960> click<00:00:31.320> on<00:00:31.529> system<00:00:32.279> right

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
right here you click on system right

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.549 
right here you click on system right
here<00:00:32.730> you'll<00:00:33.480> bring<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.870> this<00:00:34.050> place

here you'll bring you to this place

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.560 
here you'll bring you to this place
and<00:00:34.649> right<00:00:35.640> here<00:00:35.670> installed<00:00:36.510> memory<00:00:37.020> ram<00:00:38.570> look

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
and right here installed memory ram look

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.990 
and right here installed memory ram look
at<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.840> number<00:00:40.020> right<00:00:40.200> here<00:00:40.260> from<00:00:40.559> me<00:00:40.680> it's

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
at this number right here from me it's

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.840 
at this number right here from me it's
8.00<00:00:42.000> gigabytes<00:00:42.480> divide<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.620> by<00:00:44.040> 2<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.579> then

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
8.00 gigabytes divide that by 2 and then

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.639 
8.00 gigabytes divide that by 2 and then
memorize<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.420> number<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:45.960> for<00:00:46.110> me<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:46.379> for

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
memorize that number so for me it's for

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.830 
memorize that number so for me it's for
alright<00:00:47.489> now<00:00:47.700> what<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.030> want<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.210> do<00:00:48.300> minimize

doesn't really matter and then go down
here<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.689> java<00:01:10.140> arguments<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.340> um<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.930> click

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
here to java arguments so um you click

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.499 
here to java arguments so um you click
on<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:14.340> little<00:01:14.610> check<00:01:14.820> here<00:01:14.850> means

that you can change it you'd normally
there'll<00:01:18.479> be<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.630> bunch<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.960> like<00:01:19.110> numbers<00:01:19.470> are

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
there'll be a bunch of like numbers are

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.700 
there'll be a bunch of like numbers are
here<00:01:19.740> delete<00:01:20.040> all<00:01:20.250> them<00:01:20.490> down<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.970> X<00:01:21.420> MX<00:01:22.110> 5

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
here delete all them down to the X MX 5

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.210 
here delete all them down to the X MX 5
G<00:01:23.150> it<00:01:24.150> might<00:01:24.390> be<00:01:24.630> 2<00:01:25.020> G<00:01:25.259> if<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.710> haven't<00:01:25.979> changed

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
G it might be 2 G if you haven't changed

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.280 
G it might be 2 G if you haven't changed
anything<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.520> computer<00:01:26.970> yet<00:01:27.119> but<00:01:27.450> yeah<00:01:27.750> so

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
anything on computer yet but yeah so

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.530 
anything on computer yet but yeah so
remember<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:29.009> divided<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.610> 8<00:01:29.909> gigabytes<00:01:30.390> by

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
remember you divided that 8 gigabytes by

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.800 
remember you divided that 8 gigabytes by
2<00:01:31.040> so<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.100> change<00:01:32.579> whatever<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.600> number

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
2 so you change whatever this number

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.899 
2 so you change whatever this number
here<00:01:34.110> was<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.009> number<00:01:35.220> where<00:01:35.820> you

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
here was to that number where you

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.310 
here was to that number where you
divided<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.360> by<00:01:36.450> 2<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:36.630> for<00:01:36.960> me<00:01:37.020> it's<00:01:37.110> four

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
divided it by 2 so for me it's four

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.649 
divided it by 2 so for me it's four
click<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.100> 4<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.460> that's<00:01:38.610> 4<00:01:38.850> gigabytes<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.420> RAM

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
click on 4 so that's 4 gigabytes of RAM

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.780 
click on 4 so that's 4 gigabytes of RAM
um<00:01:40.380> if<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:40.979> have<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.130> little<00:01:41.400> bit<00:01:41.520> more<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.729> a

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
um if you have a little bit more of a

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.370 
um if you have a little bit more of a
powerful<00:01:42.090> computer<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.689> can<00:01:42.840> add<00:01:43.049> one<00:01:43.259> to

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
powerful computer you can add one to

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.450 
powerful computer you can add one to
that<00:01:43.409> which<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.829> what<00:01:43.979> I'm<00:01:44.070> doing<00:01:44.310> right<00:01:44.399> here

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
that which is what I'm doing right here

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.730 
that which is what I'm doing right here
so<00:01:44.820> I'm<00:01:44.880> gonna<00:01:45.030> have<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.270> be<00:01:45.390> 5<00:01:45.659> gigabytes<00:01:46.590> but

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
so I'm gonna have it be 5 gigabytes but

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.670 
so I'm gonna have it be 5 gigabytes but
yeah<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:47.520> once<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.970> click<00:01:48.509> Save<00:01:48.780> profile<00:01:49.259> and

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
yeah so once you click Save profile and

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.889 
yeah so once you click Save profile and
then<00:01:50.040> right<00:01:50.520> here<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:50.759> profile<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.420> go<00:01:51.540> down

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
then right here on profile you go down

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.050 
then right here on profile you go down
click<00:01:52.680> on<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:52.950> new<00:01:53.130> one<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.430> just<00:01:53.549> made<00:01:53.759> and

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
click on that new one you just made and

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.270
