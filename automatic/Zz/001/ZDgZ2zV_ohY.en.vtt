guitars that I happen to be playing so

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:57.360 
guitars that I happen to be playing so
that's<00:04:50.800> one<00:04:51.480> very<00:04:52.480> useful<00:04:53.040> feature<00:04:54.040> of<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:56.370> VG

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
that's one very useful feature of the VG

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.960 
that's one very useful feature of the VG
99v<00:04:58.210> guitar<00:04:58.780> that<00:04:59.710> many<00:05:00.100> people<00:05:00.520> are<00:05:00.820> not

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
99v guitar that many people are not

99v guitar that many people are not
aware<00:05:01.030> of<00:05:01.390> and<00:05:01.900> I<00:05:02.830> find<00:05:03.160> it<00:05:03.310> very<00:05:03.370> useful

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
aware of and I find it very useful

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.450 
aware of and I find it very useful
because<00:05:04.630> I<00:05:04.900> wanted<00:05:05.320> to<00:05:05.440> change<00:05:05.680> my<00:05:05.860> pickups

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
because I wanted to change my pickups

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.620 
because I wanted to change my pickups
from<00:05:07.330> my<00:05:07.510> guitar<00:05:07.950> old<00:05:08.950> habits<00:05:09.580> and<00:05:09.730> that's<00:05:10.420> the

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
from my guitar old habits and that's the

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.590 
from my guitar old habits and that's the
habit<00:05:10.930> I<00:05:11.020> was<00:05:11.230> in<00:05:11.490> then<00:05:12.490> I<00:05:12.520> was<00:05:12.880> forced<00:05:13.180> to<00:05:13.330> find

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
habit I was in then I was forced to find

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.260 
habit I was in then I was forced to find
that<00:05:13.810> parameter<00:05:14.440> as<00:05:14.830> I<00:05:15.190> went<00:05:15.400> through<00:05:15.460> the<00:05:15.940> VG

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
that parameter as I went through the VG

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.720 
that parameter as I went through the VG
99<00:05:16.900> and<00:05:17.290> then<00:05:17.800> I<00:05:17.860> discovered<00:05:18.430> there<00:05:18.610> were

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
99 and then I discovered there were

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.110 
99 and then I discovered there were
other<00:05:19.090> ways<00:05:19.330> of<00:05:19.600> doing<00:05:19.750> it<00:05:19.990> as<00:05:20.110> well<00:05:20.350> but<00:05:21.220> now

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
other ways of doing it as well but now

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.450 
other ways of doing it as well but now
I've<00:05:22.570> got<00:05:22.870> the<00:05:22.990> best<00:05:23.170> of<00:05:23.350> both<00:05:23.500> worlds<00:05:24.010> I<00:05:24.220> have

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
I've got the best of both worlds I have

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.900 
I've got the best of both worlds I have
a<00:05:24.490> set<00:05:24.880> up<00:05:25.030> on<00:05:25.450> my<00:05:25.750> system<00:05:26.230> to<00:05:26.800> switch<00:05:27.100> the
