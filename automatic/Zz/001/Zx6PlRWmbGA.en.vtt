00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 we meet with Juan Manuel Marquez 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:06.359
 Juan Manuel who has changed for this 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.690
 fourth fight so we changed 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.370
 much has been a little speed the 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.309
 use the movement of the legs to change 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.410
 of direction being with movement of 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.640
 waist the speed I think it's going to 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.240
 be an important point of which we have 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.699
 changed that motivates you for this room 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.980
 Combat what motivates for this room 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.689
 combat is to leave your top of the ring as 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.760
 I've done it in the other three fights and 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.349
 throughout my career but if what we 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.790
 It motivates me to raise my hand 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.390
 I think that already doing a good job and 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.960
 doing an exceptional job and 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.739
 winning and doing things well 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.899
 ring wounds 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.940
 what I want is that what the judges 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.789
 rate what is happening and that 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.800
 Logically, if that is how it is 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.800
 refer to me raise your hand to whom 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.770
 favors that aggressiveness of which both 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.719
 they have been talking because I think they are 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.940
 important points because maybe he 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.090
 could have trained on the counterattack 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.250
 and I am a fighter who practically 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.559
 the kickbacks are given to me they give me and 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.729
 I have been given throughout my career 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.540
 then it is a strategy game is 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.760
 a game of 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.020
 the people above the ring and me 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.910
 I think what we are going to do is that 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.350
 we are going to use a lot also the 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.960
 aggressiveness but with intelligence as 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.230
 I told you which of the three decisions 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.810
 It is the one that has most upset you this 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.640
 last the third the third I think that 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.160
 it was a decision and a fight where 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.930
 won clear and it is this decision of the 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.120
 third fight was where he gave me the most 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.100
 courage and where else and bothered me what happened 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.260
 for your mind when you listen again 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.420
 the name of manny pacquiao winner and 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.520
 how did you get over it gave me much 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.229
 courage was very angry after that 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.479
 third fight that we're practically 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.000
 thinking about retirement but good what 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.710
 to overcome it is that I have the support of my 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.869
 I have family support my team 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.340
 I work with the support of my entire country 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.550
 all Mexicans and that's what I 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.560
 has motivated for this fourth fight and what 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.479
 I have overcome that because of the support I have 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.550
 had with people with family with 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.290
 the team is why I accepted this 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.690
 fourth fight and that support because you have to 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.050
 prove it next Saturday you are the 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.030
 more technical boxer more thinking up 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.819
 of the quadrilateral but apparently the 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.120
 judges favor aggressiveness 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.609
 so that I adored those dazzling moments 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.620
 of pacquiao how to counteract that 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:20.450
 perception of the judges therefore equal with 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.359
 aggressiveness not using using the 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.400
 intelligence using the speed of 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:27.349
 use the aggressiveness then they will be 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.849
 very important points for this fight 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.799
 that's why we also want 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.489
 that the judges see something else then 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:36.049
 to see seeing something other than what 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.389
 we want is that you have to use the 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:41.180
 aggressiveness you have to use the technique there 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:43.219
 to use the experience that are points 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.310
 very important for judges to see 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:48.139
 another thing compares manny pacquiao that 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.680
 I shot you three times in the first round 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:53.419
 in 2004 that you face for fourth 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.069
 Then I think it's going to come out 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:56.449
 same as in that 2004 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.760
 manny pacquiao comes a defeat with 

00:02:56.449 --> 00:03:01.280
 timothy bradley and then he wants 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.500
 amend your way wants want to leave 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.180
 of course you know you did not lose and I think 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.219
 that will come out with everything and I'm from 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.870
 agreement that a year ago I was also me 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.489
 stripped of the triumph I will go out with 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.650
 everything then that makes it a great 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.239
 fight is going to be a war that's why 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.630
 you always have to be with the 552 well 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.400
 positions above the ring 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.410
 and that's the way it is going to be seen by the 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.960
 amateurs with another great war because 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.840
 do you think that despite their improvements 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:29.050
 your evolution as a boxer you follow 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.570
 being that little pebble in his shoes that 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:35.200
 they are just there you are there high 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.460
 but I think it's grace the 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.290
 condition that we have had in each 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.090
 of the fights but it is also that we are 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.920
 some fighters who are adjusting round 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.380
 after round we are not fighters that 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.760
 they come out in the round do the same to 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.830
 next they erred do the same if not 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.840
 we are adjusting the work we are seeing 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.540
 that it's okay that it's wrong and we were going 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.910
 doing the cleanups that we do not 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.740
 they serve us by adjusting on each 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.780
 every round I think they are points 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.150
 important that this is manny pacquiao 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.600
 he finds this type of fights difficult 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.520
 I would do for you and your bequeathed a 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.650
 victory finally against 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.330
 Pacquiao is a great happiness to have the 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.100
 victory nothing else for me will be a great 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.680
 happiness than what with that mentality 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.870
 we come but it will be happiness for me 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.670
 family would be happiness for a whole 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.440
 village will be happiness for all 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.210
 Mexicans around the world that's why 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.550
 that we are very excited and 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.159
 aware that we have 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.810
 all the support of our country that is a 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:29.280
 It is a great responsibility but also 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.069
 great motivation to know that the 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.129
 people are supporting us take us to that 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:36.990
 moment in which you feel the 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:39.990
 disappointment of listening 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.030
 manny pacquiao winner who passes by you 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.550
 in your heart in your mind when 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.069
 again you feel deprived good 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.819
 when the judge begins to give 114 114 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:53.580
 from there we felt like that 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:57.009
 take the wrong thing not when the 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.839
 another judge of 114 112 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:00.939
 We said good because that's where you start 

00:04:58.839 --> 00:05:03.789
 compose the thing and the third Thursday 

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:05.710
 when God 116-112 we gave name to 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:07.300
 we won because we did the work 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.979
 necessary we did the work that we have 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.139
 to make a perfect fight for 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.960
 get the win but when they say that 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:16.029
 still champion manny pacquiao gave me a 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.759
 great courage a great courage I felt 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:21.339
 disappointed by why people are 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:23.319
 there I was disappointed by the fans 

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:25.930
 I bought a ticket to see a fight 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:28.330
 and practically cheat him of this 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.610
 way I think he gave me a gave me 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.080
 sadness of others and needed very angry 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.770
 that he was practically thinking about the 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.629
 retirement 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.639
 you still think about the retirement there juan 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:38.979
 manuel for good time depends on what 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:40.719
 go east in this this Saturday in this 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:43.659
 fight we know it's a difficult fight 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:46.120
 a tough fight and we're not thinking about 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:48.309
 the retreat if this fight is not going to be 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.499
 a one a watershed for my career 

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:54.159
 let's see what happens if it is that 

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:57.159
 It depends on how it ends up 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:59.020
 fight let's see if we continue we do not 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:00.819
 we brake let's see why they are also 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.520
 20 years of career 20 years of career 

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:05.169
 as a professional and 8 years of career 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.389
 I kill then practically all the 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:08.620
 dedicated life this sport I know that 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:10.960
 you also have to think seriously 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.199
 thank you very much Juan Manuel and luck 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.199
 Thank you
