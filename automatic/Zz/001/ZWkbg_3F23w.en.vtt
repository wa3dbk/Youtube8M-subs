made these into a little point so that

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.740 
made these into a little point so that

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
most localized application of the hair

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.600 
most localized application of the hair
and<00:03:47.180> then<00:03:47.990> once<00:03:48.170> that<00:03:48.350> dries<00:03:48.500> we<00:03:49.190> can<00:03:49.310> just<00:03:49.430> put

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
and then once that dries we can just put

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.370 
and then once that dries we can just put
makeup<00:03:49.760> right<00:03:50.090> over<00:03:50.360> that<00:03:50.480> dried<00:03:50.750> spirit<00:03:51.170> gum

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
makeup right over that dried spirit gum

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.940 
makeup right over that dried spirit gum
