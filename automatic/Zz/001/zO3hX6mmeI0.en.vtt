00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello everybody, my name is excel wilton 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.380
 electronic security multiply the largest 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.360
 possible as you encode the contents 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.040
 I also noticed the equipment 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.519
 used 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.069
 this is the nat test called ttx that this 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.710
 gap that control not only on the boards 

00:00:17.069 --> 00:00:22.679
 current only in practices 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.300
 if you have this control it does not work 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.429
 in which 2 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.710
 the other the normal control of today is this 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:31.289
 here I left piccinin 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.140
 he said button is in this way that 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.640
 there are some variations here in the backlands 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.780
 that works on the road while here 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.629
 several things 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.890
 the most common is black according to color 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.890
 does not matter 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.519
 and this is the famous these cars 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:52.469
 We will qualify here with the 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:56.370
 battery is to be placed in the location that we 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.769
 we have some plates this one is the plate 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:14.100
 Used to have come back more but I can more 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:17.670
 powerful judge max 2000 and 2002 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.310
 even with the qualifying button to May 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.500
 at 64 thousand 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.920
 is more common and works normally in the 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.070
 ct 2.184 thousand copies 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.399
 any of them since when I have 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:45.200
 that starting now will keep this 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:02:03.840
 common control of a button reads a button 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:02:05.480
 paid and not a button if it were the case you 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.760
 have more than 1 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.250
 in the same hotel where there is one for each 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.380
 equipment on site 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.510
 if you are more distance they have the same 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.290
 which we recommend you can practice 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.460
 any button on at all 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.170
 equipment 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.790
 so let's go with the shaking button now 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.160
 show how anyone 1 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.450
 if you have two or three gates in place 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.370
 will always get one for each 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:35.120
 gate is not to open one button 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:38.420
 can not handle this here and even 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:49.190
 again may be just what button 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:55.400
 hit twice works like the 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:57.230
 Oscar can keep it at the place already 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.480
 installed but the ideal is not recommended 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.170
 that were before 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.170
 if you have any problems you already know 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:09.490
 how only two wires work, we do not 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.600
 we make facilities in the vehicle 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.450
 I do not want to talk about what would be done. 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.320
 with high is reliable 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.580
 the positive legacy in the chassis 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.940
 sorry the negative is the black river in the 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.459
 chassis and positive that I went and out 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.250
 the arrow with an independence button with the 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.440
 independent button also thing can 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.820
 get out of here is and qualified the same way 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.500
 who qualified the observation controls 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.410
 and does not use battery in the first battery 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.400
 it is connected directly to the 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.570
 vehicle 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:50.660
 We 're on the drums, you can only stay there. 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:53.090
 puts negative on the negative battery 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:58.790
 press the button the same way you 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:02.260
 command that alleging possible that a 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.260
 command and fished the other 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:14.740
 ready it is quantified to test also 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:17.530
 do not take the test that the consumer notes 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.450
 There you can stay another xk teach palm trees 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.790
 also here if you want to see the board 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.050
 can explain all the others 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.380
 first you have to be careful to 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.900
 web button can stay locked and this + 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.990
 tenth and will lose all memories 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.690
 control has already been modified 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:37.870
 if necessary, carry the following suitcase 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:48.930
 press the button safe power according 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:48.930
 let's count here from a 10 11 23 578 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:59.380
 It was getting okay seeing everyone that I 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:04.000
 I found everything working 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:05.890
 this is the recording of the control link 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.620
 thanks to help the new team and excel 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:14.530
 electronic sign 0 31 6 3 7 6 8 6 40 31 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.100
 8 756 2 14 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.100
