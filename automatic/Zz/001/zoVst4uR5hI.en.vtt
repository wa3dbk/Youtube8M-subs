00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.890
 after the success thanks 39 presented 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.660
 last year the yards of the pardo today 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.629
 are engaging in implementation 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.629
 of a new model of anzola e 43 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.640
 the project that now as seen in 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.920
 these images are close to being 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.270
 completed the fruit of the work of a 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.190
 well-knit team 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.489
 the same one that created the lunch at 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.489
 39 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.390
 the drawing by claudio but elected with the 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.900
 collaboration of which I turned the 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.250
 project manager the yard of the pardo 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.680
 to get to the final model 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.230
 the technical office of the yard and it 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.540
 maletto studies have achieved 26 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.440
 hulls a very large number for one 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.440
 standard park 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.810
 even more than with 39 the 43 before 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:25.030
 moving to the operational phase was 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.030
 subject of in-depth studies and research 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.729
 studies that covered each individual 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.460
 part of the boat from the hull 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:38.780
 the appendix up to the tree 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.940
 and the grand soleil 43 sails is made 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.290
 in fiberglass with carbon forces 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.540
 in the structures a special study on 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.149
 materials allowed to use 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:55.700
 different stories at different points a 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:57.830
 depending on the loads the 43 that will be 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.440
 presented at the autumn salons is 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.930
 a version proposed in two versions 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.180
 cruise is a racing version of the two 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.190
 portions despite having the same 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.330
 design and structures are deeply 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.330
 different from each other 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.630
 the realization of the interiors such as 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.480
 tradition in the house of the pardo is 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.400
 particularly taken care of by the choice of 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.070
 wood that comes here in logs for 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.340
 to be able to guarantee a uniformity of 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:30.070
 color veins up to the processing is 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.190
 all done tending to the maximum 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.190
 quality 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.400
 the layout is unique three cabins and two bathrooms 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.859
 the aft cabins are very spacious 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.750
 thanks to the large maximum beam that it is 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:48.750
 squeezes very slightly towards the stern
