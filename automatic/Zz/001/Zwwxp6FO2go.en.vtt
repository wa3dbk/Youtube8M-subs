so<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:06.119> my<00:02:06.479> opinion<00:02:06.840> if<00:02:06.960> they<00:02:07.049> gotta<00:02:07.259> step<00:02:07.560> up

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
so a my opinion if they gotta step up

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.680 
so a my opinion if they gotta step up
their<00:02:07.860> game<00:02:07.890> either<00:02:08.759> they<00:02:08.910> got<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.239> increase

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
their game either they got to increase

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.449 
their game either they got to increase
