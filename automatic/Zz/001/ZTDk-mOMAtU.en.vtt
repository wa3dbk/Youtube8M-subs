00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.559

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.750
 with the car when they enter with the car 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.560
 they realize that this is sand you can 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.300
 focus the sand is unstable the cars 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.400
 they get stuck and suddenly they give 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.020
 mind that we have deer but not the 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.020

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.790
 they can not take out the specific car that 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.040
