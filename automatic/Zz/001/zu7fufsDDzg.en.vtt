recently<00:01:14.869> this<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.140> one<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.409> them<00:01:16.619> but<00:01:16.830> I

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
recently this is just one of them but I

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.700 
recently this is just one of them but I
flat<00:01:17.250> spotted<00:01:17.580> two<00:01:17.880> other<00:01:18.060> ones<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.710> this

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
flat spotted two other ones and this

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.859 
flat spotted two other ones and this
one's<00:01:19.950> about<00:01:20.130> fifty<00:01:20.670> eight<00:01:20.790> millimeters<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.659> I

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
one's about fifty eight millimeters so I

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.240 
one's about fifty eight millimeters so I
mean<00:01:22.740> it's<00:01:22.920> not<00:01:23.280> very<00:01:23.490> useful<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:24.090> me<00:01:24.240> anymore

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
mean it's not very useful to me anymore

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.780 
mean it's not very useful to me anymore
okay<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.420> obviously<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.430> 2010<00:01:29.430> because

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
okay so obviously this is 2010 because

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.840 
okay so obviously this is 2010 because
it's<00:01:29.939> got<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:31.220> whatever<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.610> like<00:01:32.820> a

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
it's got the whatever that is like a

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.149 
it's got the whatever that is like a
eagle<00:01:33.090> or<00:01:33.479> hawk<00:01:33.840> as<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.619> graphic<00:01:35.009> or

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
eagle or hawk as the graphic or

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.130 
eagle or hawk as the graphic or
something<00:01:35.540> that<00:01:36.540> doesn't<00:01:36.810> really<00:01:36.900> matter

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
something that doesn't really matter

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.810 
something that doesn't really matter
flip<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.189> board<00:01:38.430> over<00:01:39.799> I<00:01:40.799> give<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.610> look<00:01:41.700> at

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
flip the board over I give you a look at

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.700 
flip the board over I give you a look at
the<00:01:41.909> concave<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:44.149> main<00:01:45.149> feature

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
the concave and this is the main feature

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.810 
the concave and this is the main feature
really<00:01:46.710> good<00:01:46.860> thing<00:01:47.100> it's<00:01:47.369> kind<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.579> hard<00:01:47.759> to

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
really good thing it's kind of hard to

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.499 
really good thing it's kind of hard to
see<00:01:48.000> cuz<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.450> drop<00:01:48.770> but<00:01:50.240> what<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.360> has<00:01:51.479> a

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
see cuz of the drop but what it has a

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.370 
see cuz of the drop but what it has a
deep<00:01:52.079> tub<00:01:52.409> Colin<00:01:53.130> cave<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.990> it<00:01:54.990> doesn't<00:01:55.320> have

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
deep tub Colin cave and it doesn't have

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.959 
deep tub Colin cave and it doesn't have
a<00:01:55.439> W<00:01:55.829> in<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.070> middle<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.549> it's<00:01:56.700> going<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.909> be

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
a W in the middle so it's going to be

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:57.340 
a W in the middle so it's going to be
really

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
really

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.789 
really
easy<00:01:57.439> to<00:01:57.590> push<00:01:57.799> and<00:01:58.780> that<00:01:59.780> it's<00:02:00.229> got<00:02:00.439> really

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
easy to push and that it's got really

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.840 
easy to push and that it's got really
sharp<00:02:00.830> edges<00:02:01.460> and<00:02:01.939> it's<00:02:02.150> a<00:02:02.360> point<00:02:02.990> five<00:02:03.500> five

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
sharp edges and it's a point five five

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.430 
sharp edges and it's a point five five
deep<00:02:04.850> so<00:02:05.210> it's<00:02:05.390> just<00:02:05.630> a<00:02:05.720> little<00:02:05.930> bit<00:02:06.020> over<00:02:06.140> half

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
deep so it's just a little bit over half

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.500 
deep so it's just a little bit over half
an<00:02:06.590> inch<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:08.690> one<00:02:08.869> inch<00:02:09.020> drops<00:02:10.030> on<00:02:11.030> either

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
an inch and the one inch drops on either

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.920 
an inch and the one inch drops on either
side<00:02:12.160> they're<00:02:13.540> pretty<00:02:14.540> straight<00:02:14.900> forward

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
side they're pretty straight forward

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.650 
side they're pretty straight forward
drop<00:02:15.470> they're<00:02:15.680> not<00:02:15.800> to<00:02:15.950> gradual<00:02:16.520> but<00:02:17.270> if<00:02:17.420> you

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
drop they're not to gradual but if you

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
really can't move even if you're not

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.350 
really can't move even if you're not
doing<00:02:26.840> a<00:02:27.170> if<00:02:27.709> you<00:02:28.250> mess<00:02:28.430> up<00:02:28.459> your<00:02:28.760> slide<00:02:29.030> you're

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
doing a if you mess up your slide you're

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.170 
doing a if you mess up your slide you're
still<00:02:29.660> not<00:02:29.900> going<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.200> really<00:02:30.410> fall<00:02:30.709> off<00:02:30.920> its

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
still not going to really fall off its

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.170 
still not going to really fall off its
it<00:02:32.180> locks<00:02:32.480> you<00:02:32.660> in<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:32.870> lot<00:02:32.989> more<00:02:33.050> than<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:34.180> 925

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
it locks you in a lot more than the 925

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.300 
it locks you in a lot more than the 925
I<00:02:35.209> have<00:02:35.540> also<00:02:35.959> so<00:02:36.230> I'm<00:02:36.530> going<00:02:36.709> to<00:02:36.739> try<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:36.980> sell

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
I have also so I'm going to try to sell

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.180 
I have also so I'm going to try to sell
that<00:02:37.540> because<00:02:38.540> this<00:02:38.840> board<00:02:39.080> is<00:02:39.230> really<00:02:39.530> just

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
that because this board is really just

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.000 
that because this board is really just
working<00:02:40.700> out<00:02:40.880> great<00:02:41.060> for<00:02:41.269> me<00:02:41.330> all<00:02:41.569> around<00:02:42.010> I

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
working out great for me all around I

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.820 
working out great for me all around I
like<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.880> farther<00:02:44.209> out<00:02:44.300> wheelbase<00:02:44.870> because

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
like the farther out wheelbase because

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.090 
like the farther out wheelbase because
the<00:02:45.950> calibers<00:02:46.400> shorten<00:02:47.120> your<00:02:47.269> wheel<00:02:47.480> base<00:02:47.720> so

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
the calibers shorten your wheel base so

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.530 
the calibers shorten your wheel base so
might<00:02:49.100> as<00:02:49.190> well<00:02:49.370> use<00:02:49.519> the<00:02:49.700> farther<00:02:50.000> away<00:02:50.090> one

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
might as well use the farther away one

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.270 
might as well use the farther away one
and<00:02:51.790> transferred<00:02:52.790> my<00:02:52.970> nose<00:02:53.209> guards<00:02:53.690> because

I flipped it a couple times and you can
see<00:03:04.400> some<00:03:05.410> fiberglass<00:03:06.410> shipping<00:03:07.340> on<00:03:08.320> certain

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
see some fiberglass shipping on certain

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.190 
see some fiberglass shipping on certain
areas<00:03:09.470> of<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.860> board<00:03:10.130> and<00:03:10.780> other<00:03:11.780> than<00:03:11.989> that<00:03:12.170> I

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
areas of the board and other than that I

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.560 
areas of the board and other than that I
mean<00:03:12.410> it's<00:03:12.829> held<00:03:13.190> up<00:03:13.310> pretty<00:03:13.549> solidly<00:03:14.120> before

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
mean it's held up pretty solidly before

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.949 
mean it's held up pretty solidly before
I<00:03:14.600> put<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:14.870> nose<00:03:15.049> guards<00:03:15.440> on<00:03:15.590> I<00:03:15.620> had<00:03:15.920> a<00:03:16.840> just<00:03:17.840> a

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
I put the nose guards on I had a just a

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.830 
I put the nose guards on I had a just a
little<00:03:18.260> tail<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:18.950> I<00:03:19.190> mean<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.120> bamboo<00:03:20.510> is<00:03:20.780> a

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
little tail and I mean the bamboo is a

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.759 
little tail and I mean the bamboo is a
little<00:03:21.530> bit<00:03:21.680> less<00:03:22.840> durable<00:03:23.840> than<00:03:24.109> the<00:03:24.170> maple

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
little bit less durable than the maple

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.590 
little bit less durable than the maple
board<00:03:25.010> such<00:03:25.640> as<00:03:25.790> like<00:03:25.940> a<00:03:25.970> land<00:03:26.239> yachts<00:03:26.450> or

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
board such as like a land yachts or

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.740 
board such as like a land yachts or
something<00:03:26.989> but<00:03:27.790> if<00:03:28.790> you<00:03:28.970> can<00:03:29.150> be<00:03:29.269> careful<00:03:29.630> with

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
something but if you can be careful with

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.539 
something but if you can be careful with
your<00:03:29.840> boards<00:03:30.230> this<00:03:30.769> is<00:03:30.920> definitely<00:03:31.340> going<00:03:31.459> to

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
your boards this is definitely going to

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.819 
your boards this is definitely going to
be<00:03:31.670> better<00:03:31.880> I'll<00:03:32.870> show<00:03:33.049> you<00:03:33.109> the<00:03:33.320> ride<00:03:33.560> height

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
be better I'll show you the ride height

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.610 
be better I'll show you the ride height
in<00:03:34.100> my<00:03:34.400> opinion<00:03:34.930> it's<00:03:35.930> really<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:36.380> perfect

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
in my opinion it's really the perfect

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.990 
in my opinion it's really the perfect
height<00:03:36.950> off<00:03:37.130> the<00:03:37.310> ground<00:03:38.079> you've<00:03:39.079> got<00:03:40.000> let's

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
height off the ground you've got let's

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.500 
height off the ground you've got let's
see<00:03:42.010> got<00:03:43.010> a<00:03:43.040> little<00:03:43.220> bit<00:03:43.459> of<00:03:43.579> height<00:03:43.790> so<00:03:44.450> you

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
see got a little bit of height so you

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.050 
see got a little bit of height so you
know<00:03:44.810> you<00:03:44.900> can<00:03:45.049> have<00:03:45.620> control<00:03:45.829> of<00:03:46.190> your<00:03:46.519> drifts

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
know you can have control of your drifts

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.360 
know you can have control of your drifts
and<00:03:47.180> everything<00:03:47.600> but<00:03:48.200> it's<00:03:48.350> not<00:03:48.530> too<00:03:48.769> high<00:03:49.040> so

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
and everything but it's not too high so

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.740 
and everything but it's not too high so
you<00:03:49.459> won't<00:03:49.579> be<00:03:49.760> able<00:03:49.850> to<00:03:50.030> throw<00:03:50.329> like<00:03:50.510> a<00:03:50.540> really

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
you won't be able to throw like a really

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.199 
you won't be able to throw like a really
quick<00:03:51.079> slide<00:03:51.500> you<00:03:52.190> still<00:03:52.489> get<00:03:52.640> that<00:03:52.670> ideal

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
quick slide you still get that ideal

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.660 
quick slide you still get that ideal
amount<00:03:53.510> of<00:03:53.660> turn<00:03:53.989> that<00:03:54.829> you<00:03:54.950> would<00:03:55.130> from<00:03:55.280> a<00:03:55.400> top

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
amount of turn that you would from a top

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.410 
amount of turn that you would from a top
mount<00:03:55.970> but<00:03:56.329> you've<00:03:56.720> also<00:03:56.870> got<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:57.260> drops

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
mount but you've also got the drops

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.680 
mount but you've also got the drops
to<00:03:58.540> really<00:03:58.930> keep<00:03:59.110> you<00:03:59.260> in<00:03:59.410> there<00:04:00.150> it's<00:04:01.150> just<00:04:01.450> a

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
to really keep you in there it's just a

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.400 
to really keep you in there it's just a
perfect<00:04:02.080> board<00:04:02.470> and<00:04:03.360> it's<00:04:04.360> it's<00:04:05.200> very

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
perfect board and it's it's very

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.949 
perfect board and it's it's very
maneuverable<00:04:06.069> because<00:04:06.310> of<00:04:06.430> its<00:04:06.580> length<00:04:06.959> which

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
maneuverable because of its length which

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.630 
maneuverable because of its length which
is<00:04:08.319> 39<00:04:09.040> if<00:04:09.310> you<00:04:09.400> didn't<00:04:09.670> know<00:04:11.310> other<00:04:12.310> than<00:04:12.489> that

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
I mean everything about this board is a

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.440 
I mean everything about this board is a
wonderful<00:04:17.260> and<00:04:18.130> I<00:04:18.220> would<00:04:18.340> definitely<00:04:18.609> buy
