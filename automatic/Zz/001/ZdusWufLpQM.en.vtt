00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
in space with astronauts it's far from

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.929 
in space with astronauts it's far from
it<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.560> they<00:02:04.920> definitely<00:02:05.340> took<00:02:05.460> quite<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.729> few

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
it and they definitely took quite a few

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.459 
it and they definitely took quite a few
liberties<00:02:06.210> but<00:02:06.810> they<00:02:06.960> did<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.259> for

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
liberties but they did it for

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.410 
liberties but they did it for
entertainment<00:02:08.340> value<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.700> I'm<00:02:08.910> okay<00:02:09.270> with

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
entertainment value and I'm okay with

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.730 
entertainment value and I'm okay with
that<00:02:09.570> I<00:02:09.600> didn't<00:02:09.899> go<00:02:09.990> to<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.170> movie<00:02:10.380> expecting

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740

movie gravity and a mine

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.230 
movie gravity and a mine
now<00:04:43.130> the<00:04:43.190> reason<00:04:43.550> I<00:04:43.610> gave<00:04:43.670> the<00:04:43.910> movie<00:04:44.030> an

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
now the reason I gave the movie an

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.910 
now the reason I gave the movie an
a-minus<00:04:44.780> is<00:04:44.930> because<00:04:45.200> the<00:04:45.320> movie<00:04:45.560> does<00:04:45.740> have

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
a-minus is because the movie does have

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.860 
a-minus is because the movie does have
some<00:04:46.100> flaws<00:04:46.340> like<00:04:46.580> I<00:04:46.610> mentioned<00:04:47.150> and<00:04:47.270> also<00:04:47.750> I

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
some flaws like I mentioned and also I

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.720 
some flaws like I mentioned and also I
think<00:04:48.200> this<00:04:48.320> is<00:04:48.470> a<00:04:48.500> one-time<00:04:49.010> experience<00:04:49.490> I

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
think this is a one-time experience I

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.370 
think this is a one-time experience I
don't<00:04:49.910> feel<00:04:50.180> like<00:04:50.300> this<00:04:50.420> movie<00:04:50.750> will<00:04:51.140> give<00:04:51.290> me

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
don't feel like this movie will give me

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.230 
don't feel like this movie will give me
the<00:04:51.530> same<00:04:51.740> thing<00:04:52.040> the<00:04:52.550> second<00:04:52.940> time<00:04:53.090> around

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
the same thing the second time around

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.560 
the same thing the second time around
and<00:04:53.600> re-watch<00:04:54.380> ability<00:04:54.890> is<00:04:55.220> a<00:04:55.520> big<00:04:55.940> part<00:04:56.270> of<00:04:56.390> my
