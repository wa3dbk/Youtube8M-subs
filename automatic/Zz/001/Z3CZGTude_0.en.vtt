 Today I'm going to untangle your mind and 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.199
 at the same time confusing to know the 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.900
 I wanted to talk to him but he is not so 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.590
 easy guess you'll have to meet 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.619
 first 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.269

 fine 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:41.640
 diego shows today will see tiago maragoni 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:52.800
 Marangoni, I 'll show you my three sheikh 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:55.800
 evolution that I had of Bruno is there 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.780
 we know the difference of the supplement 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.460
 gava and cna for muscle recovery 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.570
 if we want help in improving the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.539
 mortgages 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.909
 Okay, great question, is this what? 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.700
 moleque pretension gaba is an amino acid 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.670
 which acts on the central nervous system is 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.820
 it damaged some nerves of our 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.130
 nervous system where when equal to 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.490
 muscle and like muscles when 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:25.590
 the body needs to regenerate and 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:28.560
 This increases the power of the tone. 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.650
 muscle is the books that takes the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.950
 muscle tone regenerates and became more 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.770
 strong and also he helped I disputed that 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.540
 it helps in the transport of protein 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.420
 also in blood on steel 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.700
 already the cna is as it says the name is zinc 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.310
 magnesium vitamin b6 okay 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.880
 the zinc and magnesium atom is in certain 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.130
 hormones are they promote the 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:59.850
 natural testosterone production is 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:02.820
 good and bes the b6 vitamin she is help you 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.189
 transport of zinc magnesium it only went 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.510
 added to help transport 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.670
 the most important is the zinc magnesium 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.130
 it was one of the combinations they increase the 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.050
 immune system and also do not think 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.250
 that there is a muscular recovery 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:20.650
 ie you using gaba 15m to you will 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.740
 have practically the best yet 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.880
 acting stars is in your body in the generation 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:30.910
 great muscle business goes from maycon 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.570
 oliveira castro léo if i make prince 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.180
 French in France takes more 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:41.890
 the following also makes thread 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:44.170
 No one will like the next one. 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.760
 Cléber Moura and Moncho have a teacher 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.490
 in the gym where the prize that always 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.860
 that if you train two muscles using 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.940
 agony slow agony of the same day as 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.830
 time and shoulder 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.340
 you will atrophy the musicians that you 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:01.030
 You think it's good that you train. 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:04.420
 antagonist and agonist on the same day in the 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:08.920
 same practice I would say would be advantageous in the same 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:11.800
 It's not advantageous, it's fine, you? 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.709
 to train the antagonist agonist in the same 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.959
 in the same workout sends you roll up 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.900
 family only to that place there 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.730
 where it is being for example in this 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.040
 I said that the week to leave everything 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.019
 to the chest and shoulder arm area you 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.290
 Look at the blood donated by that area you 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.810
 has a legal use of the train 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.209
 but if you divide by training made of 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.930
 morning or evening for example not yet 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:41.080
 because you will have propitiated the muscle 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:44.590
 pectoralis the secondary muscle that goes 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.420
 have been solved will also be the shoulder 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.680
 so when you went on the night wave at 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.330
 another occasion 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.830
 you will is in process of regeneration 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:57.370
 You will interrupt this process. 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:04:00.160
 next goes from joão freitas shows how 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.790
 Do you have a beautiful girlfriend, your pulse? 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.750
 I also do not know how I managed this 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:09.730
 maybe it's because I command quite well 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.310
 with this question will vinícius details 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.470
 léo, your fuckin 'fan is a video that 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.780
 You talk about insulin time, what's this? 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.560
 when the benefits and nigeria for the 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:23.889
 good hypertrophy the peak insulin is 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:28.180
 coolest thing in the world because because 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:32.380
 when you are in the process of telling the 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:35.500
 roughly speaking is putting the 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.840
 in the right place where the body 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.950
 sends the nutrients is a time when 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.830
 the body gets the highest nutrient 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:44.410
 O place right muscled need 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.380
 human protein Pope along the lower 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.990
 I was there with this time, let's say. 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.360
 where to digest the food and everything is going 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.270
 to the right place understood then this is 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.830
 the insulin peak 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.060
 This was one more question to the girl here in the 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.830
 monster factory
