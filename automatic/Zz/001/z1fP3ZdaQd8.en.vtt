let's run into the forest so I mean for
ultra<00:02:30.600> settings<00:02:30.840> it's<00:02:31.320> definitely

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
ultra settings it's definitely

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.200

anything but I'm just trying to show you
guys<00:02:38.340> like<00:02:38.730> different<00:02:39.120> environments<00:02:39.660> how

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
guys like different environments how

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.330 
guys like different environments how
this<00:02:39.930> thing<00:02:40.080> performs<00:02:40.530> on<00:02:40.709> very<00:02:41.130> high

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
this thing performs on very high

00:02:41.340 --> 00:03:01.360 
this thing performs on very high
settings

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.539 

alright<00:03:02.239> so<00:03:02.599> that's<00:03:03.349> enough<00:03:03.709> of<00:03:03.890> that<00:03:03.950> lag

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
alright so that's enough of that lag

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.140 
alright so that's enough of that lag
eNOS<00:03:04.909> let's<00:03:05.840> go<00:03:05.959> ahead<00:03:06.049> and<00:03:06.909> switch<00:03:07.909> the

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
eNOS let's go ahead and switch the

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.030 
eNOS let's go ahead and switch the
graphics<00:03:08.599> down<00:03:08.840> to<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:09.260> recommended

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
graphics down to the recommended

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.869 
graphics down to the recommended
settings<00:03:10.489> and<00:03:10.730> we'll<00:03:10.849> see<00:03:11.180> how<00:03:11.360> crisis<00:03:11.900> does

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
settings and we'll see how crisis does

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.490 
settings and we'll see how crisis does
okay<00:03:13.879> so<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.239> computer<00:03:14.450> is<00:03:14.690> scanning<00:03:15.110> it<00:03:15.349> for

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
okay so the computer is scanning it for

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.350 
okay so the computer is scanning it for
optimal<00:03:15.860> settings<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:16.459> it<00:03:16.549> has<00:03:16.670> changed<00:03:17.180> it

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
optimal settings and it has changed it

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.330 
optimal settings and it has changed it
let's<00:03:17.840> see<00:03:18.079> what<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.379> optimal<00:03:18.709> settings<00:03:19.099> are

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
let's see what the optimal settings are

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.420 
let's see what the optimal settings are
now<00:03:19.870> sauna<00:03:20.870> graphics<00:03:21.440> entire<00:03:21.799> listing<00:03:22.129> is<00:03:22.250> off

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
now sauna graphics entire listing is off

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.360 
now sauna graphics entire listing is off
still<00:03:22.849> full<00:03:23.060> screen<00:03:23.450> at<00:03:23.799> 2560<00:03:24.799> x<00:03:24.920> 1440<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:27.950> so

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
still full screen at 2560 x 1440 and so

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.119 
still full screen at 2560 x 1440 and so
apparently<00:03:29.360> it<00:03:29.900> chose<00:03:30.230> to<00:03:30.500> just<00:03:30.650> put<00:03:30.950> it<00:03:31.040> on

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
apparently it chose to just put it on

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.580 
apparently it chose to just put it on
high<00:03:31.400> for<00:03:31.459> everything<00:03:31.970> not<00:03:32.150> very<00:03:32.450> high<00:03:32.659> so

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
high for everything not very high so

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.449 
high for everything not very high so
every<00:03:34.280> single<00:03:35.709> advanced<00:03:36.709> option<00:03:37.010> is<00:03:37.129> on<00:03:37.280> high

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
every single advanced option is on high

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.089 
every single advanced option is on high
so<00:03:37.879> let's<00:03:38.090> go<00:03:38.239> ahead<00:03:38.269> and<00:03:38.420> play<00:03:38.720> this<00:03:38.750> now<00:03:39.170> see

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
so let's go ahead and play this now see

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:48.190 
so let's go ahead and play this now see
how<00:03:40.220> it<00:03:40.310> works<00:03:40.400> out<00:03:46.150> alright<00:03:47.150> so<00:03:47.659> as<00:03:47.989> you<00:03:48.109> can
