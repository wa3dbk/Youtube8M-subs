into the assembly area we have taken a
very<00:01:07.890> specialized<00:01:08.610> approach<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.270> how<00:01:09.420> we

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
very specialized approach to how we

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.539 
very specialized approach to how we
assemble<00:01:09.900> these<00:01:10.200> engines<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.159> kind<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.430> a

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
assemble these engines it's a kind of a

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.000 
assemble these engines it's a kind of a
craftsman<00:01:12.000> approach<00:01:12.450> it's<00:01:12.720> not<00:01:12.900> a

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
craftsman approach it's not a

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.710 
craftsman approach it's not a
mass-produced<00:01:14.030> process<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.270> that's<00:01:15.570> what

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
mass-produced process and that's what

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.090 
mass-produced process and that's what
the<00:01:15.780> commercial<00:01:16.200> engine<00:01:16.439> customer<00:01:16.890> really

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
the commercial engine customer really

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.219 
the commercial engine customer really
expects<00:01:17.850> these<00:01:18.030> things<00:01:18.330> reliability

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229

get<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.519> process<00:02:08.940> set<00:02:09.119> up<00:02:09.239> around<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:11.750> so<00:02:12.750> when

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
get a process set up around that so when

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.750 
get a process set up around that so when
we<00:02:13.019> began<00:02:13.290> this<00:02:13.500> process<00:02:13.769> we<00:02:14.250> really<00:02:14.489> had<00:02:14.640> to

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
we began this process we really had to

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.580 
we began this process we really had to
contrast<00:02:15.269> back<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.840> what<00:02:16.080> we<00:02:16.230> do<00:02:16.410> in

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
contrast back to what we do in

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.170 
contrast back to what we do in
traditional<00:02:16.709> manufacturing<00:02:17.160> here<00:02:17.879> breaks

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
traditional manufacturing here breaks

traditional manufacturing here breaks
this<00:02:18.870> line<00:02:19.110> had<00:02:19.349> to<00:02:19.379> be<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.560> little<00:02:19.830> bit

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
this line had to be a little bit

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.259 
this line had to be a little bit
different<00:02:20.340> we<00:02:20.459> wanted<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.790> have<00:02:20.970> an

all-encompassing team of technicians and

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.759 
all-encompassing team of technicians and
that's<00:02:24.150> really<00:02:24.330> a<00:02:24.420> self-directed<00:02:25.200> work<00:02:25.379> team

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
that's really a self-directed work team

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.070 
that's really a self-directed work team
they<00:02:26.580> take<00:02:26.790> ownership<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.540> from<00:02:27.660> start<00:02:27.959> to
