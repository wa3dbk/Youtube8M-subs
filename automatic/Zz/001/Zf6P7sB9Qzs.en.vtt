install the case how to remove it you're
going<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.269> get<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.420> thank<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.900> card<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.380> you

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
going to get a thank you card that you

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.260 
going to get a thank you card that you
can<00:00:31.650> see<00:00:31.859> here<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.309> then<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.850> course<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
can see here and then of course the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.750 
can see here and then of course the
insert<00:00:33.660> itself<00:00:34.219> with<00:00:35.219> some<00:00:35.520> additional

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
insert itself with some additional

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.869 
insert itself with some additional
directions<00:00:36.329> now<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.840> case<00:00:37.140> itself<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:38.129> a

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
directions now the case itself is a

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.940 
directions now the case itself is a
two-part<00:00:39.570> case<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.200> it's<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.440> bit<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.710> hybrid

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
two-part case so it's a bit of a hybrid

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.040 
two-part case so it's a bit of a hybrid
case<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.670> sense<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.059> one<00:00:42.780> you've<00:00:43.020> got

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
case in the sense that one you've got

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.319 
case in the sense that one you've got
your<00:00:43.379> inner<00:00:43.559> shell<00:00:43.950> which<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.460> made<00:00:44.670> out<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.910> a

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
your inner shell which is made out of a

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.639 
your inner shell which is made out of a
silicone<00:00:46.020> very<00:00:46.829> flexible<00:00:47.489> very<00:00:47.520> impact<00:00:48.649> I

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
silicone very flexible very impact I

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.010 
silicone very flexible very impact I
don't<00:00:50.340> necessarily<00:00:50.520> know<00:00:50.969> if<00:00:51.000> resistant<00:00:51.899> is

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
don't necessarily know if resistant is

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.439 
don't necessarily know if resistant is
the<00:00:52.289> word<00:00:52.469> but<00:00:52.550> absorbent<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.670> suppose<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
the word but absorbent I suppose is the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.020 
the word but absorbent I suppose is the
word<00:00:54.570> I'm<00:00:54.719> looking<00:00:54.750> for<00:00:55.309> and<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
word I'm looking for and this is the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.849 
word I'm looking for and this is the
inner<00:00:57.210> shell<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.809> then<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.289> course<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.649> outer

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
inner shell and then of course the outer

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.130 
inner shell and then of course the outer
shell<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.730> hard<00:00:59.969> plastic<00:01:00.210> as<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.719> can<00:01:00.899> hear

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
shell is a hard plastic as you can hear

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.359 
shell is a hard plastic as you can hear
hear<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:03.059> goes<00:01:03.270> on<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:04.110> inner<00:01:05.040> shell

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
hear and that goes on the inner shell

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.070 
hear and that goes on the inner shell
I'm<00:01:05.909> going<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.119> show<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.330> how<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.479> works<00:01:06.840> in

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
I'm going to show you how that works in

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.020 
I'm going to show you how that works in
just<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.409> moment<00:01:07.740> here<00:01:07.920> now<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.520> get<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.820> case

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
just a moment here now to get the case

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.230 
just a moment here now to get the case
on<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.049> really<00:01:10.530> easy<00:01:10.640> at<00:01:11.640> least<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.060> first

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
on it is really easy at least the first

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.810 
on it is really easy at least the first
step<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.590> second<00:01:14.220> step<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.580> little<00:01:14.729> bit

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
step is the second step is a little bit

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.609 
step is the second step is a little bit
more<00:01:14.909> challenging<00:01:15.119> but<00:01:15.570> not<00:01:15.600> too<00:01:15.869> bad<00:01:16.049> first

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
more challenging but not too bad first

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:17.570 
more challenging but not too bad first
thing<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.830> want<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.070> do<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.250> make<00:01:17.310> sure

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
thing you want to do is make sure

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.550 
thing you want to do is make sure
everything<00:01:17.970> lines<00:01:18.119> up<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.720> again<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
everything lines up so again this is the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.429 
everything lines up so again this is the
silicone<00:01:20.210> inner<00:01:21.210> shell<00:01:21.720> which<00:01:21.990> just

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
silicone inner shell which just

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.649 
silicone inner shell which just
stretches<00:01:23.070> over<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.610> case<00:01:23.850> as<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.390> see

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
stretches over the case as you can see

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.260 
stretches over the case as you can see
here<00:01:25.189> now<00:01:26.189> normally<00:01:26.640> with<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.850> case<00:01:27.030> like

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
here now normally with the case like

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.870 
here now normally with the case like
this<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.900> get<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.710> lot<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:28.979> flex<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.549> get<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.700> lot

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
this you get a lot of flex you get a lot

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.600 
this you get a lot of flex you get a lot
of<00:01:29.909> Bend<00:01:30.320> and<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.710> becomes<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.189> bit<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.400> an<00:01:32.490> issue

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
of Bend and it becomes a bit of an issue

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.420 
of Bend and it becomes a bit of an issue
well<00:01:33.060> because<00:01:33.780> CVO<00:01:34.170> did<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.590> two-part<00:01:35.159> case

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
well because CVO did this two-part case

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.060 
well because CVO did this two-part case
is<00:01:35.729> hybrid<00:01:36.270> once<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:36.930> put<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.320> on<00:01:37.560> you're

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
is hybrid once we put this on you're

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.219 
is hybrid once we put this on you're
going<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.250> notice<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:38.880> whole<00:01:39.150> thing<00:01:39.229> no

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
going to notice that this whole thing no

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.530 
going to notice that this whole thing no
longer<00:01:40.619> flexes<00:01:41.130> like<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.490> which<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> very

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
longer flexes like that which is a very

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.330 
longer flexes like that which is a very
good<00:01:42.600> thing<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.259> helps<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.649> keep<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.100> place

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
good thing it helps to keep it in place

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.550 
good thing it helps to keep it in place
so<00:01:44.729> before<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.420> put<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.049> couple<00:01:46.439> of

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
so before I put this on a couple of

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.980 
so before I put this on a couple of
things<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.009> note<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.509> exterior

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
things to note this is the exterior

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.080 
things to note this is the exterior
shell<00:01:49.290> that's<00:01:49.560> hard<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.979> don't<00:01:50.250> know<00:01:50.399> why<00:01:50.670> it's

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
shell that's hard I don't know why it's

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.710 
shell that's hard I don't know why it's
designed<00:01:51.600> with<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:52.049> centerpiece<00:01:53.479> but<00:01:54.479> just

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
designed with this centerpiece but just

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.660 
designed with this centerpiece but just
so<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.899> know<00:01:55.140> that's<00:01:55.439> what<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.920> looks<00:01:56.460> like

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
so you know that's what it looks like

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.469 
so you know that's what it looks like
you<00:01:57.360> also<00:01:57.509> have<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.840> camera<00:01:58.229> area<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:59.579> as<00:02:00.360> you

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
you also have the camera area and as you

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.690 
you also have the camera area and as you
can<00:02:00.630> see<00:02:00.659> here<00:02:01.229> it's<00:02:01.950> almost<00:02:02.130> like<00:02:02.310> Affeldt

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
can see here it's almost like Affeldt

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.969 
can see here it's almost like Affeldt
it's<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.719> raised<00:02:03.960> area<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.380> it's<00:02:04.469> like<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.619> felt

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
it's a raised area and it's like a felt

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.620 
it's a raised area and it's like a felt
so<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.369> helps<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.759> keep<00:02:05.909> your<00:02:06.149> camera

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
so it helps to keep your camera

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.830 
so it helps to keep your camera
protected<00:02:07.759> additionally<00:02:08.759> there<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.720> way

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
protected additionally there so the way

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.150 
protected additionally there so the way
that<00:02:09.959> you<00:02:10.050> get<00:02:10.170> this<00:02:10.289> on<00:02:10.500> again<00:02:10.709> we've<00:02:10.979> already

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
that you get this on again we've already

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.040 
that you get this on again we've already
put<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.520> silicone

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
put the silicone

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.290 
put the silicone
peace<00:02:12.200> on<00:02:12.440> you<00:02:13.220> are<00:02:13.400> going<00:02:13.670> to<00:02:13.820> start<00:02:14.090> with

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
peace on you are going to start with

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.420 
peace on you are going to start with
this<00:02:14.630> side<00:02:14.690> where<00:02:15.260> your<00:02:15.410> volume<00:02:15.770> controls<00:02:15.800> are

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
this side where your volume controls are

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.350 
this side where your volume controls are
and<00:02:16.550> you<00:02:16.610> want<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.820> make<00:02:16.940> sure<00:02:16.970> that

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
and you want to make sure that

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.180 
and you want to make sure that
everything<00:02:17.390> lines<00:02:18.020> up<00:02:18.260> just<00:02:18.650> fine<00:02:18.950> there

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
everything lines up just fine there

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.730 
everything lines up just fine there
including<00:02:19.850> this<00:02:20.090> area<00:02:20.420> so<00:02:20.630> you<00:02:20.660> can<00:02:20.750> see<00:02:21.200> now

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
including this area so you can see now

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.110 
including this area so you can see now
on<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:21.890> silicone<00:02:22.400> piece<00:02:22.580> you've<00:02:22.820> got<00:02:22.970> this

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
on the silicone piece you've got this

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.150 
on the silicone piece you've got this
bump<00:02:23.480> out<00:02:23.690> that's<00:02:24.320> going<00:02:24.500> to<00:02:24.560> help<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.800> lock

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
bump out that's going to help to lock

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.540 
bump out that's going to help to lock
this<00:02:25.490> in<00:02:25.550> place<00:02:26.030> so<00:02:26.870> we've<00:02:27.100> lined<00:02:28.100> them<00:02:28.280> up<00:02:28.370> on

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
this in place so we've lined them up on

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.520 
this in place so we've lined them up on
this<00:02:28.730> side<00:02:28.970> everything<00:02:29.270> looks<00:02:29.630> good<00:02:29.900> and<00:02:30.170> then

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
this side everything looks good and then

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.690 
this side everything looks good and then
you're<00:02:30.650> just<00:02:30.680> going<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:30.950> work<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.310> around<00:02:31.370> to

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
you're just going to work it around to

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.100 
you're just going to work it around to
the<00:02:31.790> other<00:02:31.850> side<00:02:32.030> now<00:02:32.480> this<00:02:32.630> requires<00:02:32.990> a

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
the other side now this requires a

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.530 
the other side now this requires a
little<00:02:33.320> bit<00:02:33.470> of<00:02:33.560> effort<00:02:34.010> because<00:02:34.550> the

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
little bit of effort because the

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.890 
little bit of effort because the
hardshell<00:02:36.050> case<00:02:36.350> flexes<00:02:37.040> but<00:02:37.250> not<00:02:37.430> too<00:02:37.670> much

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
hardshell case flexes but not too much

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.450 
hardshell case flexes but not too much
it<00:02:38.900> flexes<00:02:39.230> enough<00:02:39.680> that<00:02:39.860> you<00:02:39.950> can<00:02:40.100> get<00:02:40.280> the

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
it flexes enough that you can get the

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.300 
it flexes enough that you can get the
case<00:02:40.730> on<00:02:41.000> so<00:02:41.510> once<00:02:41.900> you've<00:02:42.650> lined<00:02:43.010> it<00:02:43.220> up

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
case on so once you've lined it up

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.470 
case on so once you've lined it up
you're<00:02:43.520> just<00:02:43.550> going<00:02:43.850> to<00:02:43.910> kind<00:02:44.120> of<00:02:44.210> work<00:02:44.450> that

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
you're just going to kind of work that

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.580 
you're just going to kind of work that
silicone<00:02:45.410> into<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:47.050> into<00:02:48.050> the<00:02:48.170> hardshell

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
silicone into the into the hardshell

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.500 
silicone into the into the hardshell
case<00:02:48.830> until<00:02:49.280> it<00:02:49.460> looks<00:02:49.670> like<00:02:49.850> it<00:02:50.030> fits<00:02:50.240> in

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
case until it looks like it fits in

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.720 
case until it looks like it fits in
there<00:02:50.660> pretty<00:02:50.870> well<00:02:51.230> now<00:02:51.830> I<00:02:52.130> would<00:02:52.400> recommend

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
there pretty well now I would recommend

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.760 
there pretty well now I would recommend
if<00:02:53.120> you<00:02:53.540> have<00:02:53.690> this<00:02:53.900> case<00:02:54.140> if<00:02:54.380> you<00:02:54.410> get<00:02:54.620> the

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
if you have this case if you get the

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.280 
if you have this case if you get the
case<00:02:54.980> spend<00:02:55.910> a<00:02:56.000> little<00:02:56.120> bit<00:02:56.240> more<00:02:56.450> time<00:02:56.750> for

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
case spend a little bit more time for

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.140 
case spend a little bit more time for
the<00:02:57.320> video<00:02:57.560> purposes<00:02:57.980> here<00:02:58.430> I'm<00:02:58.850> going<00:02:59.030> to

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
the video purposes here I'm going to

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.540 
the video purposes here I'm going to
just<00:02:59.630> move<00:02:59.840> along<00:03:00.020> but<00:03:00.980> you<00:03:01.070> want<00:03:01.250> to<00:03:01.310> spend<00:03:01.490> a

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
just move along but you want to spend a

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.220 
just move along but you want to spend a
little<00:03:01.670> bit<00:03:01.760> more<00:03:01.940> time<00:03:02.240> you<00:03:02.810> know<00:03:02.840> kind<00:03:03.170> of

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
little bit more time you know kind of

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.590 
little bit more time you know kind of
work<00:03:03.380> in<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.620> silicone<00:03:04.040> into<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.460> hard<00:03:04.820> shell

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
work in the silicone into the hard shell

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.050 
work in the silicone into the hard shell
itself<00:03:06.260> you'll<00:03:06.800> get<00:03:06.920> a<00:03:06.950> better<00:03:07.100> fit<00:03:07.550> it'll

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
itself you'll get a better fit it'll

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.970 
itself you'll get a better fit it'll
line<00:03:08.270> up<00:03:08.450> better<00:03:08.630> and<00:03:08.990> you<00:03:09.350> won't<00:03:09.470> get<00:03:09.650> as<00:03:09.800> many

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
line up better and you won't get as many

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.690 
line up better and you won't get as many
you<00:03:10.940> know<00:03:11.060> gaps<00:03:11.450> not<00:03:12.080> that<00:03:12.290> you<00:03:12.920> know<00:03:13.040> gaps<00:03:13.490> is

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
you know gaps not that you know gaps is

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.190 
you know gaps not that you know gaps is
a<00:03:13.730> problem<00:03:14.120> with<00:03:14.240> the<00:03:14.270> case<00:03:14.510> but<00:03:14.690> you<00:03:14.780> can<00:03:14.960> see

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
a problem with the case but you can see

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.840 
a problem with the case but you can see
as<00:03:15.410> you<00:03:15.740> work<00:03:15.950> it<00:03:16.100> it's<00:03:16.220> going<00:03:16.370> to<00:03:16.459> fit<00:03:16.610> better

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
as you work it it's going to fit better

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.240 
as you work it it's going to fit better
so<00:03:17.270> once<00:03:18.170> you<00:03:18.290> get<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:18.530> case<00:03:18.739> on<00:03:18.950> as<00:03:19.130> i

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
so once you get the case on as i

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.949 
so once you get the case on as i
mentioned<00:03:19.760> take<00:03:19.940> a<00:03:19.970> look<00:03:20.180> at<00:03:20.270> this<00:03:20.450> it<00:03:20.750> doesn't

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
mentioned take a look at this it doesn't

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.229 
mentioned take a look at this it doesn't
i'm<00:03:21.230> applying<00:03:21.739> force<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:22.489> because<00:03:22.790> that<00:03:22.970> hard

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
i'm applying force and because that hard

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.260 
i'm applying force and because that hard
shell<00:03:23.510> is<00:03:23.750> on<00:03:24.050> it's<00:03:24.830> not<00:03:24.980> pulling<00:03:25.550> away<00:03:25.670> so<00:03:25.880> it

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
shell is on it's not pulling away so it

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.610 
shell is on it's not pulling away so it
really<00:03:26.450> helps<00:03:26.780> to<00:03:26.930> keep<00:03:27.080> it<00:03:27.230> in<00:03:27.350> place

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
really helps to keep it in place

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.180 
really helps to keep it in place
especially<00:03:28.040> in<00:03:28.640> these<00:03:28.790> two<00:03:29.090> areas<00:03:29.120> here<00:03:30.010> up<00:03:31.010> at

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
especially in these two areas here up at

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.860 
especially in these two areas here up at
the<00:03:31.310> top<00:03:31.489> yeah<00:03:32.030> you've<00:03:32.300> got<00:03:32.330> a<00:03:32.450> little<00:03:32.630> bit<00:03:32.810> of

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
the top yeah you've got a little bit of

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.780 
the top yeah you've got a little bit of
flex<00:03:33.080> still<00:03:33.380> but<00:03:33.890> you<00:03:34.010> know<00:03:34.130> putting<00:03:34.370> this<00:03:34.610> in

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
flex still but you know putting this in

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.000 
flex still but you know putting this in
and<00:03:34.940> out<00:03:35.000> of<00:03:35.030> a<00:03:35.209> pocket<00:03:35.420> it<00:03:35.750> doesn't<00:03:36.170> snag<00:03:36.680> it

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
and out of a pocket it doesn't snag it

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.760 
and out of a pocket it doesn't snag it
doesn't<00:03:37.280> catch<00:03:37.520> so<00:03:37.940> it's<00:03:38.060> not<00:03:38.209> pulling<00:03:38.660> away

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
doesn't catch so it's not pulling away

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.380 
doesn't catch so it's not pulling away
the<00:03:39.770> most<00:03:39.950> flexible<00:03:40.520> area<00:03:40.850> and<00:03:41.090> that's

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
the most flexible area and that's

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.090 
the most flexible area and that's
probably<00:03:41.570> because<00:03:41.810> you<00:03:41.959> got<00:03:42.080> the<00:03:42.200> big<00:03:42.380> cut<00:03:43.010> out

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
probably because you got the big cut out

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.520 
probably because you got the big cut out
for<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.400> doc<00:03:43.610> here<00:03:43.940> is<00:03:44.060> the<00:03:44.480> bottom<00:03:44.660> so<00:03:45.260> you

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
for the doc here is the bottom so you

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.920 
for the doc here is the bottom so you
can<00:03:45.770> see<00:03:45.950> that<00:03:45.980> it<00:03:46.220> does<00:03:46.370> flex<00:03:46.730> a<00:03:47.150> bit<00:03:47.720> there

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
can see that it does flex a bit there

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.990 
can see that it does flex a bit there
but<00:03:48.380> it's<00:03:48.530> nothing<00:03:48.709> problematic<00:03:49.610> again<00:03:49.970> I

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
but it's nothing problematic again I

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.440 
but it's nothing problematic again I
have<00:03:50.209> an<00:03:50.330> experienced<00:03:50.959> issues<00:03:51.320> with<00:03:51.500> that<00:03:51.709> so

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
have an experienced issues with that so

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.020 
have an experienced issues with that so
let's<00:03:53.450> take<00:03:53.630> a<00:03:53.660> very<00:03:54.140> quick<00:03:54.320> tour<00:03:54.590> of<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:54.770> case

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
let's take a very quick tour of the case

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.320 
let's take a very quick tour of the case
this<00:03:56.030> area<00:03:56.480> for<00:03:56.840> your<00:03:57.140> silent<00:03:58.010> switch<00:03:58.330> very

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
this area for your silent switch very

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.180 
this area for your silent switch very
deep<00:03:59.630> I<00:03:59.900> will<00:04:00.170> tell<00:04:00.320> you<00:04:00.440> that<00:04:00.470> right<00:04:00.620> now<00:04:00.860> if

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
deep I will tell you that right now if

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.560 
deep I will tell you that right now if
you<00:04:01.340> don't<00:04:01.489> have<00:04:01.640> small<00:04:01.940> fingers<00:04:02.180> you're

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
you don't have small fingers you're

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:03.550 
you don't have small fingers you're
going<00:04:02.720> to<00:04:02.780> need<00:04:02.930> to<00:04:03.050> have<00:04:03.170> a<00:04:03.230> nail<00:04:03.530> or

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
going to need to have a nail or

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.440 
going to need to have a nail or
something<00:04:03.950> to<00:04:04.250> reach<00:04:04.430> in<00:04:04.640> there<00:04:04.820> because<00:04:05.060> it's

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
something to reach in there because it's

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.370 
something to reach in there because it's
a<00:04:05.570> bit<00:04:06.190> troublesome<00:04:07.190> to<00:04:07.520> get<00:04:07.730> at<00:04:07.910> so<00:04:08.300> that<00:04:09.230> is

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
a bit troublesome to get at so that is

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.979 
a bit troublesome to get at so that is
the<00:04:09.410> one<00:04:10.340> of<00:04:10.489> two<00:04:10.670> things<00:04:10.700> that<00:04:11.090> I<00:04:11.239> wish<00:04:11.450> maybe

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
the one of two things that I wish maybe

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.030 
the one of two things that I wish maybe
could<00:04:12.380> have<00:04:12.440> been<00:04:12.560> done<00:04:12.680> a<00:04:12.739> little<00:04:12.920> bit

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
could have been done a little bit

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.430 
could have been done a little bit
differently<00:04:13.600> so<00:04:14.600> that's<00:04:14.750> one<00:04:14.959> thing<00:04:15.110> to<00:04:15.260> note

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
differently so that's one thing to note

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.190 
differently so that's one thing to note
the<00:04:16.190> buttons<00:04:16.549> here<00:04:16.970> real<00:04:17.510> nice<00:04:17.780> that<00:04:18.019> they've

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
the buttons here real nice that they've

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.020 
the buttons here real nice that they've
covered<00:04:18.470> up<00:04:18.739> the<00:04:18.950> volume<00:04:19.400> buttons<00:04:19.760> and

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
covered up the volume buttons and

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.970 
covered up the volume buttons and
they're<00:04:20.150> very<00:04:20.410> responsive<00:04:21.410> so<00:04:21.760> let<00:04:22.760> me<00:04:22.820> go

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
they're very responsive so let me go

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.020 
they're very responsive so let me go

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
hear the response as well because you'll

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:36.920 
hear the response as well because you'll
hear<00:04:30.570> it<00:04:30.660> click<00:04:34.730> and<00:04:35.730> you<00:04:36.360> can<00:04:36.510> see<00:04:36.690> that's

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
hear it click and you can see that's

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.160 
hear it click and you can see that's
very<00:04:37.400> responsive<00:04:38.400> up<00:04:38.940> on<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.270> top<00:04:39.540> this

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
very responsive up on the top this

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.250 
very responsive up on the top this
button<00:04:40.470> for<00:04:40.830> your<00:04:40.950> sleep<00:04:41.250> wake<00:04:41.840> it<00:04:42.840> doesn't

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
button for your sleep wake it doesn't

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.840 
button for your sleep wake it doesn't
really<00:04:43.350> raise<00:04:43.680> out<00:04:43.920> and<00:04:44.130> I<00:04:44.190> wish<00:04:44.370> it<00:04:44.550> did

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
really raise out and I wish it did

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.760 
really raise out and I wish it did
because<00:04:45.240> it's<00:04:45.450> pretty<00:04:45.720> flush<00:04:46.140> with<00:04:46.410> the<00:04:46.440> case

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
because it's pretty flush with the case

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.710 
because it's pretty flush with the case
you<00:04:47.460> can<00:04:47.640> kind<00:04:47.790> of<00:04:47.940> feel<00:04:48.210> where<00:04:48.510> it's<00:04:48.630> supposed

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
you can kind of feel where it's supposed

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.080 
you can kind of feel where it's supposed
to<00:04:49.110> be<00:04:49.290> but<00:04:50.220> again<00:04:50.310> you're<00:04:50.640> not<00:04:50.760> going<00:04:50.910> to<00:04:50.970> get

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
to be but again you're not going to get

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.970 
to be but again you're not going to get
the<00:04:51.180> tactile<00:04:51.630> clicking<00:04:52.230> response<00:04:52.650> like<00:04:52.860> you

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
the tactile clicking response like you

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.910 
the tactile clicking response like you
do<00:04:53.100> with<00:04:53.220> these<00:04:53.400> buttons<00:04:53.790> or<00:04:54.000> anything<00:04:54.030> so<00:04:54.920> you

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
do with these buttons or anything so you

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.430 
do with these buttons or anything so you
press<00:04:56.160> it<00:04:56.220> and<00:04:56.430> it'll<00:04:56.790> work<00:04:57.120> and<00:04:58.080> it's<00:04:58.260> not

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
press it and it'll work and it's not

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.000 
press it and it'll work and it's not
hard<00:04:58.770> to<00:04:58.860> press<00:04:59.160> but<00:04:59.550> it<00:04:59.670> just<00:05:00.000> isn't<00:05:00.240> as<00:05:01.010> like

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
hard to press but it just isn't as like

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.860 
hard to press but it just isn't as like
a<00:05:02.040> tactile<00:05:02.580> response<00:05:02.790> or<00:05:03.390> anything<00:05:03.750> of<00:05:03.840> that

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
a tactile response or anything of that

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.440 
a tactile response or anything of that
nature<00:05:03.990> so<00:05:04.560> keep<00:05:04.740> that<00:05:04.770> in<00:05:04.980> mind<00:05:05.280> also<00:05:06.240> at<00:05:06.360> the

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
nature so keep that in mind also at the

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.970 
nature so keep that in mind also at the
top<00:05:06.630> you've<00:05:06.840> got<00:05:06.870> your<00:05:07.110> headphone<00:05:07.470> jack<00:05:07.770> and

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
top you've got your headphone jack and

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.010 
top you've got your headphone jack and
your<00:05:08.490> noise-cancelling<00:05:09.240> that<00:05:09.390> lines<00:05:09.600> up<00:05:09.750> well

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
your noise-cancelling that lines up well

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.900 
your noise-cancelling that lines up well
and<00:05:10.170> good<00:05:10.410> it's<00:05:10.980> a<00:05:11.130> little<00:05:11.340> bit<00:05:11.460> deep<00:05:11.670> but<00:05:11.880> I

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
and good it's a little bit deep but I

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.700 
and good it's a little bit deep but I
haven't<00:05:12.240> had<00:05:12.330> any<00:05:12.510> issues<00:05:12.720> using<00:05:13.200> any<00:05:13.470> of<00:05:13.590> the

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
haven't had any issues using any of the

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.190 
haven't had any issues using any of the
headphones<00:05:13.890> that<00:05:14.190> I've<00:05:14.370> got<00:05:14.660> on<00:05:15.660> the<00:05:15.870> bottom

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
headphones that I've got on the bottom

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.130 
headphones that I've got on the bottom
we've<00:05:16.560> got<00:05:16.770> your<00:05:16.920> cut<00:05:17.100> out<00:05:17.220> for<00:05:17.550> your<00:05:17.850> dock<00:05:18.840> and

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
we've got your cut out for your dock and

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.890 
we've got your cut out for your dock and
also<00:05:19.860> for<00:05:20.160> your<00:05:20.340> microphone<00:05:21.000> and<00:05:21.330> for<00:05:21.720> your

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
also for your microphone and for your

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.950 
also for your microphone and for your
speaker<00:05:22.380> it's<00:05:23.250> pretty<00:05:23.760> well<00:05:24.030> cut<00:05:24.300> out<00:05:24.450> so<00:05:24.720> most

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
speaker it's pretty well cut out so most

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.540 
speaker it's pretty well cut out so most
docs<00:05:25.230> should<00:05:25.560> work<00:05:25.740> with<00:05:25.920> this<00:05:26.040> and<00:05:26.280> it's<00:05:26.370> not

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
docs should work with this and it's not

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.310 
docs should work with this and it's not
too<00:05:26.760> deep<00:05:27.000> there<00:05:27.300> so<00:05:27.840> you<00:05:27.930> shouldn't<00:05:28.170> have

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
too deep there so you shouldn't have

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.100 
too deep there so you shouldn't have
much<00:05:28.470> of<00:05:28.530> a<00:05:28.740> problem<00:05:28.950> with<00:05:29.250> that<00:05:29.750> this<00:05:30.750> side<00:05:31.080> is

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
much of a problem with that this side is

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.320 
much of a problem with that this side is
completely<00:05:31.470> enclosed<00:05:32.280> obviously<00:05:32.910> these<00:05:33.060> two

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
completely enclosed obviously these two

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.330 
completely enclosed obviously these two
areas<00:05:33.540> where<00:05:33.990> the<00:05:34.110> silicone<00:05:34.320> kind<00:05:34.950> of<00:05:35.070> comes

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
areas where the silicone kind of comes

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.760 
areas where the silicone kind of comes
out<00:05:35.580> is<00:05:35.790> what's<00:05:36.060> locking<00:05:36.930> the<00:05:37.110> hard<00:05:37.320> shell<00:05:37.530> and

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
out is what's locking the hard shell and

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.820 
out is what's locking the hard shell and
took<00:05:37.890> into<00:05:38.400> the<00:05:38.520> case<00:05:38.730> and<00:05:39.720> then<00:05:40.290> finally<00:05:40.710> on

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
took into the case and then finally on

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.920 
took into the case and then finally on
the<00:05:40.920> back<00:05:41.100> this<00:05:41.430> is<00:05:41.580> really<00:05:41.910> interesting<00:05:42.240> and

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
the back this is really interesting and

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.540 
the back this is really interesting and
something<00:05:43.230> that<00:05:43.500> I<00:05:43.530> haven't<00:05:43.740> seen<00:05:44.010> in<00:05:44.190> any<00:05:44.400> of

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
something that I haven't seen in any of

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.090 
something that I haven't seen in any of
the<00:05:44.670> other<00:05:44.790> cases<00:05:45.120> that<00:05:45.570> I've<00:05:45.690> got<00:05:46.560> my<00:05:46.740> hands

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
the other cases that I've got my hands

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.890 
the other cases that I've got my hands
on<00:05:47.190> check<00:05:47.910> out<00:05:48.030> the<00:05:48.150> way<00:05:48.240> that<00:05:48.420> they<00:05:48.540> did<00:05:48.600> their

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
on check out the way that they did their

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.690 
on check out the way that they did their
camera<00:05:49.350> on<00:05:49.500> this<00:05:49.680> this<00:05:49.890> is<00:05:50.070> really<00:05:50.370> neat

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
camera on this this is really neat

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.760 
camera on this this is really neat
they've<00:05:51.360> gotten<00:05:51.840> their<00:05:52.110> measurements<00:05:52.740> just

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
they've gotten their measurements just

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.300 
they've gotten their measurements just
right<00:05:53.130> too<00:05:53.610> so<00:05:54.350> good<00:05:55.350> stuff<00:05:55.740> there<00:05:56.010> and<00:05:56.220> the

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
right too so good stuff there and the

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.520 
right too so good stuff there and the
good<00:05:56.670> thing<00:05:56.700> about<00:05:57.000> this<00:05:57.360> case<00:05:57.780> is<00:05:57.810> because

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
good thing about this case is because

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.110 
good thing about this case is because
they've<00:05:58.800> designed<00:05:59.130> the<00:05:59.340> camera<00:05:59.760> like<00:05:59.880> that

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
they've designed the camera like that

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.030 
they've designed the camera like that
where<00:06:00.360> it<00:06:00.450> kind<00:06:00.630> of<00:06:00.810> creates<00:06:01.470> this<00:06:01.710> little

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.040 
where it kind of creates this little

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.370 
where it kind of creates this little
berry<00:06:02.340> or<00:06:02.520> a<00:06:02.700> wall<00:06:03.030> between<00:06:03.360> the<00:06:03.720> flash<00:06:03.990> and

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
berry or a wall between the flash and

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.120 
berry or a wall between the flash and
the<00:06:04.680> lens<00:06:05.370> itself<00:06:05.940> it<00:06:06.600> doesn't<00:06:06.960> impact<00:06:07.800> your

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
the lens itself it doesn't impact your

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.190 
the lens itself it doesn't impact your
your<00:06:08.580> camera<00:06:09.270> at<00:06:09.360> all<00:06:09.480> when<00:06:09.690> you're<00:06:09.720> taking

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
your camera at all when you're taking

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.550 
your camera at all when you're taking
pictures<00:06:10.710> with<00:06:11.700> that<00:06:11.910> LED<00:06:12.360> flash<00:06:12.720> so<00:06:13.200> it's

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
pictures with that LED flash so it's

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.250 
pictures with that LED flash so it's
really<00:06:13.980> good<00:06:14.250> in<00:06:14.370> that<00:06:14.490> respect<00:06:15.000> it<00:06:15.180> keeps<00:06:15.480> the

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:16.260 
really good in that respect it keeps the

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.470 
really good in that respect it keeps the
light<00:06:16.800> from<00:06:17.040> bleeding<00:06:17.400> over<00:06:17.700> into<00:06:17.820> the<00:06:18.120> lens

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:18.480 
light from bleeding over into the lens

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.990 
light from bleeding over into the lens
and<00:06:18.830> therefore<00:06:19.830> you<00:06:20.340> don't<00:06:20.460> end<00:06:20.670> up<00:06:20.820> with

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
and therefore you don't end up with

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.210 
and therefore you don't end up with
washed<00:06:21.240> out<00:06:21.530> images<00:06:22.530> and<00:06:22.770> things<00:06:22.950> of<00:06:23.190> that

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 
washed out images and things of that

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.180 
washed out images and things of that
nature<00:06:23.340> so<00:06:24.290> also<00:06:25.290> on<00:06:25.560> the<00:06:25.650> back<00:06:25.800> you<00:06:25.980> can<00:06:26.040> see

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
nature so also on the back you can see

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.280 
nature so also on the back you can see
it's<00:06:26.460> got<00:06:26.610> this<00:06:26.730> little<00:06:26.790> wave<00:06:27.210> design<00:06:27.570> kind<00:06:28.110> of

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.290 
it's got this little wave design kind of

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.340 
it's got this little wave design kind of
which<00:06:29.190> is<00:06:29.310> kind<00:06:29.490> of<00:06:29.550> nice<00:06:29.700> the<00:06:30.300> words<00:06:30.540> CDO

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.350 
which is kind of nice the words CDO

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.470 
which is kind of nice the words CDO
right<00:06:31.590> there<00:06:31.800> pretty<00:06:32.040> low<00:06:32.250> profile<00:06:32.760> this<00:06:33.300> is

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:33.480 
right there pretty low profile this is

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.560 
right there pretty low profile this is
the<00:06:33.860> sapphire<00:06:34.860> blue<00:06:34.980> color<00:06:35.460> and<00:06:35.700> the<00:06:36.060> material

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:36.570 
the sapphire blue color and the material

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.740 
the sapphire blue color and the material
of

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 
of

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.600 
of
the<00:06:36.810> hard<00:06:37.020> shell<00:06:37.260> piece<00:06:37.560> feels<00:06:38.130> almost<00:06:38.340> like<00:06:38.520> a

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
the hard shell piece feels almost like a

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.200 
the hard shell piece feels almost like a
satin<00:06:39.150> feel<00:06:39.420> so<00:06:39.750> it<00:06:39.870> gives<00:06:40.020> some<00:06:40.260> grip<00:06:40.730> but<00:06:41.730> at

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210 
satin feel so it gives some grip but at

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.180 
satin feel so it gives some grip but at
the<00:06:42.270> same<00:06:42.570> time<00:06:42.810> it<00:06:43.020> has<00:06:43.050> this<00:06:43.350> satin<00:06:43.740> feel<00:06:43.980> to

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 
the same time it has this satin feel to

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.820 
the same time it has this satin feel to
it<00:06:44.220> so<00:06:44.460> it's<00:06:44.580> kind<00:06:44.790> of<00:06:44.820> nice<00:06:45.000> again<00:06:45.990> I<00:06:46.230> think<00:06:46.380> it

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
it so it's kind of nice again I think it

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.700 
it so it's kind of nice again I think it
will<00:06:46.980> provide<00:06:47.400> relatively<00:06:48.330> good<00:06:48.600> drop<00:06:49.470> and

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:49.710 
will provide relatively good drop and

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.350 
will provide relatively good drop and
bump<00:06:49.950> protection<00:06:50.580> because<00:06:50.760> you've<00:06:51.030> got<00:06:51.180> this

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
bump protection because you've got this
