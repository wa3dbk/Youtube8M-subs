00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
thought about I don't know like a like

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.210 
thought about I don't know like a like
20<00:00:34.519> minutes<00:00:34.790> ago<00:00:35.059> and<00:00:35.559> it's<00:00:36.559> let's<00:00:36.920> just<00:00:37.100> say

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
20 minutes ago and it's let's just say

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.240 
20 minutes ago and it's let's just say
it's<00:00:37.519> what<00:00:37.970> not<00:00:38.210> to<00:00:38.239> do<00:00:38.770> the<00:00:39.770> first<00:00:40.040> day<00:00:40.219> of

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
it's what not to do the first day of

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.830 
it's what not to do the first day of
seventh<00:00:40.610> grade<00:00:40.820> and<00:00:40.850> that's<00:00:41.149> that's<00:00:41.450> probably

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
seventh grade and that's that's probably

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.450 
seventh grade and that's that's probably
what<00:00:42.110> the<00:00:42.230> title<00:00:42.469> will<00:00:42.680> be<00:00:42.800> something<00:00:43.250> along

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
what the title will be something along

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.760 
what the title will be something along
the<00:00:43.579> lines<00:00:43.760> of<00:00:44.000> that<00:00:44.480> because<00:00:45.050> it's<00:00:45.530> pretty

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
the lines of that because it's pretty

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.000 
the lines of that because it's pretty
funny<00:00:46.010> it's<00:00:46.700> a<00:00:46.969> short<00:00:47.420> little<00:00:47.539> story<00:00:47.899> so<00:00:48.260> I<00:00:48.289> day

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
funny it's a short little story so I day

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.380 
funny it's a short little story so I day
I<00:00:49.039> think<00:00:49.190> that<00:00:49.610> after<00:00:49.760> I'm<00:00:49.969> done<00:00:50.059> talking

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
I think that after I'm done talking

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.479 
I think that after I'm done talking
about<00:00:50.450> this<00:00:50.719> I'll<00:00:51.620> probably<00:00:51.860> still<00:00:52.129> have<00:00:52.219> time

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
about this I'll probably still have time

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.220 
about this I'll probably still have time
and<00:00:52.820> then<00:00:52.969> I'll<00:00:53.149> maybe<00:00:53.750> tell<00:00:54.020> you<00:00:54.079> a<00:00:54.140> little

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
and then I'll maybe tell you a little

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.310 
and then I'll maybe tell you a little
bit<00:00:54.320> about<00:00:54.559> the<00:00:54.739> patch<00:00:55.039> on<00:00:55.600> today<00:00:56.600> June<00:00:56.989> twenty

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.520 
um not as good as a moment for 21 but I
definitely<00:05:37.550> noticed<00:05:37.970> a<00:05:38.060> big<00:05:38.180> difference<00:05:38.530> so

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530

don't<00:05:45.020> know<00:05:45.080> i<00:05:45.110> think<00:05:45.170> he<00:05:45.410> does<00:05:45.590> that<00:05:46.120> but<00:05:47.120> it

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:47.540 
don't know i think he does that but it

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.620 
don't know i think he does that but it
appears<00:05:48.020> the<00:05:48.410> m16<00:05:48.950> gotta<00:05:49.430> buff<00:05:49.700> and<00:05:50.030> the<00:05:50.150> mp5

appears the m16 gotta buff and the mp5
fire<00:05:51.140> rate<00:05:51.440> seems<00:05:51.740> to<00:05:51.980> be<00:05:52.130> a<00:05:52.160> little<00:05:52.310> bit

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
fire rate seems to be a little bit

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.980 
fire rate seems to be a little bit
better<00:05:52.670> I<00:05:52.880> don't<00:05:53.120> know<00:05:53.180> if<00:05:53.360> I<00:05:53.450> noticed<00:05:53.780> a<00:05:53.870> huge

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
better I don't know if I noticed a huge

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.900 
better I don't know if I noticed a huge
difference<00:05:54.080> and<00:05:54.710> the<00:05:55.130> way<00:05:55.250> it<00:05:55.400> kills<00:05:55.640> what<00:05:55.850> the

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
difference and the way it kills what the

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.730 
difference and the way it kills what the
fire<00:05:56.180> rate<00:05:56.360> is<00:05:56.510> a<00:05:56.540> little<00:05:56.600> bit<00:05:56.870> but<00:05:57.470> i<00:05:57.500> also

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
fire rate is a little bit but i also

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.140 
fire rate is a little bit but i also
think<00:05:57.920> they<00:05:58.280> buff<00:05:58.490> the<00:05:58.850> PM<00:05:59.270> 9<00:05:59.510> and<00:06:00.970> i'm<00:06:01.970> not

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
think they buff the PM 9 and i'm not

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.750 
think they buff the PM 9 and i'm not
