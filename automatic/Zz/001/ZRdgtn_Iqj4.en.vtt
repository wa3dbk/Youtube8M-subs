00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
is kind of go research which carrier

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.750 
is kind of go research which carrier
gives<00:02:21.359> you<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.719> best<00:02:21.959> coverage<00:02:22.260> for<00:02:23.250> 4G<00:02:23.609> LTE

gives you the best coverage for 4G LTE
and<00:02:24.750> also<00:02:25.109> the<00:02:25.260> plans<00:02:25.560> like<00:02:25.920> if<00:02:26.129> you<00:02:26.280> need

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
and also the plans like if you need

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.420 
and also the plans like if you need
unlimited<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:27.540> don't<00:02:27.810> need<00:02:27.930> unlimited

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
unlimited you don't need unlimited

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.490 
unlimited you don't need unlimited
figure<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.609> out<00:02:29.639> before<00:02:30.150> Black<00:02:30.840> Friday<00:02:30.870> hits
