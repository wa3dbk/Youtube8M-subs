00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.210
 the Soviet Union was so huge that 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.570
 there were not enough cars 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:12.480
 so in 1957 including in the city 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.210
 samovars and gingerbread tula made 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.600
 a small batch of scooters with a stroller 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.050
 Tula 200 m to the results of the implementation of plans 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.480
 Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of 1956 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.609
 sixties in particular about replacing 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.580
 obsolete new transport vehicles 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.710
 there was a release of essentially new type 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.200
 scooter transport twice 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.300
 order bearing Tula machine-building 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.629
 Ryabikov plant mastered production 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.750
 This model modification with stroller tula 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.300
 200 mg and developed by numerous 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.309
 requests from workers, its upper part is for 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.829
 ease of landing was folding 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.230
 scooter is much more convenient than a motorcycle 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.360
 let him have a small ten inch 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.629
 wheels are designed for good coverage 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.329
 but he perfectly protects the driver from 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.859
 mud landing like a chair on the front 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.110
 flap hook for bag 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.659
 lock the seat with it 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.119
 has the tools and the petrol tank and 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.549
 the dirtiest engine is closed by the hood 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.500
 motor small volume of only 200 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.020
 cubic centimeters stroke length 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.780
 push-pull power of 9 horsepower 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.150
 a little more than a loner this one 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.780
 fan forcibly drives air 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.340
 cylinder on the other hand is located 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.750
 12-volt dyne starter as is clear from 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.119
 titles he is capable 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.360
 and generate electricity and run 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.729
 motor it was an innovation so far 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.979
 all Soviet two-wheeled vehicles 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.320
 kickstarter run 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.180
 start-up procedure according to the instructions 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.310
 special thrust opening the benzcrane 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.159
 air lever coin lever 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.470
 I pull the gas handle forward to the end 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.409
 yourself by briefly pressing the key 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.600
 launch one 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.700
 starter to switch gears on the floor 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.859
 double-shouldered gait pedal 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.409
 this scooter is almost the same as 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:01.420
 lonely stroller light and does not burden 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.609
 him but there is a significant difference in 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.009
 driving before turning especially 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:08.289
 before the right one has to slow down a lot 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.840
 speed because the stroller tends 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.379
 rise into the air if sitting in the cradle 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.420
 passenger 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:16.360
 the car's behavior changes somewhat 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.580
 you can take turns a little faster 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.849
 for industrial production is the case 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.970
 and not reached from 280 thousand scooters 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.049
 Tula 200 wheelchairs were equipped with less 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.650
 two hundred 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:31.650
 Apparently the novelty was recognized as unpromising.
