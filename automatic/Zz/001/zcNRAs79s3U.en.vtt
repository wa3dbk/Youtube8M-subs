00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.120
 hello to all the roles of the minister 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:09.980
 testing video and the opportunities I'm going 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.049
 to show how they can complete the 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.289
 contract of the queen in which they have 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:17.300
 to look for maker orvex 11 and that 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.730
 obviously they have to eliminate it this 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.920
 enemy is a servant and only what 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.750
 we can find in see so what 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.640
 what they have to do is start the 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.250
 patrol of venus and if I go to 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.619
 direct towards the area that is called 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.480
 riscos to be in case suddenly 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.280
 know how to get those hours because 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.679
 they simply follow the path that 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.239
 I'm taking here when we get to 

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:41.719
 the risks of easter we are going to 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.819
 find us with an event that is very 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.260
 similar to those we have already seen in the 

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:47.359
 other missions that we will have to fulfill 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.389
 for the queen and then simply what 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:52.999
 we are going to do is wait for this event 

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:55.069
 active after a time many times 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:56.960
 it takes 5 to 10 minutes, so 

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:58.940
 have a little patience if the 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.170
 product does not appear immediately and 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.420
 simply what we are going to do is 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.220
 wait here hopefully they go in 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.840
 patrols and do not expect there to be more 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.000
 players that you are trying to complete 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.170
 the same contract and once we are 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 here 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.619
 of esther then simply what we are going 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.600
 to do is wait let's wait for 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.130
 activate this event and to give us 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.390
 account that this event was activated 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.280
 only thing that we are going to realize is that 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.770
 down on the left side 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.659
 a message appears that says there is a 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.490
 herd of lurking lions 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.440
 once this message appears it goes to 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.659
 appear a ship that is the one that brings the 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.009
 enemies so try to locate it here 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.049
 appeared in front of me but so 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.789
 general may appear in any other 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.009
 side so they just place it and 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:38.990
 begin to eliminate the enemies the 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.479
 first enemies that are going to arrive are 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.880
 some enemies that have the cannon 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.069
 burned out that this new tlc cannon like that 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.479
 try to grab it faster 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:49.039
 possible because all the players do not 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.600
 they will create if they are not interested in carlos 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.000
 well simply that the others 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.580
 players will not fall good simply 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.280
 they are roughly four to five 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.830
 waves then the first one discovered 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.479
 I told you there are these enemies that arrive 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.899
 with the cannon of nailed the second zone 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.970
 are the normal enemies the third by 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:11.720
 they are generally invisible enemies 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.489
 and in the fourth they arrive on arriving at 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.170
 final boss if there's more than 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.830
 four you give it then simply follow 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.900
 killing 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.330
 to the enemies and they finish them until 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.770
 come the final boss I do not get the 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.810
 final turn what we have to do 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.460
 it's just starting to shoot him with 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.990
 everything we have here is very 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.970
 beneficial what I told them the start 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.650
 try to arrive with the patrol or 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.600
 with friends to comment a bit 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.330
 easier and if not then they have a lot 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.940
 careful so obviously they can 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.220
 complete this is to these waves or of 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.510
 kill all those enemies and die 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.850
 once we kill all the enemies 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.280
 we will have the possibility of winning this 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.500
 symbol of the judgment that with that what 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.840
 we can exchange with paris in the 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.100
 put good view already after 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.660
 also eliminate all enemies 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.520
 down on the left side goes to 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.190
 appear a message that says key to 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.830
 ether this means that we are going to be able 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.900
 find a chest in the vicinity 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.840
 surroundings where we killed the 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.940
 enemies that is a normal chest of the 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.270
 fallen but we will not identify because 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.850
 has a light around like 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.500
 bright yellow or green here 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.480
 you can see in the top part already 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.400
 I'm getting closer and the chest so 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.230
 try to look for it from all sides 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.900
 close so that obviously they can 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.130
 grab her 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.320
 win those rewards for having the 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.660
 possibility of earning peculiar engrams 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.700
 legend engrams we are also going to 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.860
 to receive materials from the planet 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.660
 where are we and if we are lucky 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.420
 key of the queen that serves us 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.010
 time to complete missions or 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.560
 kill all the enemies in the 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.390
 presidio of the elderly then 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.600
 basically the way to power 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.920
 find merche horvitz 11 and then 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.600
 obviously delete it then I hope 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.000
 that you liked the video if it was like that 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.200
 also leave your favorite favorites I commented 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.510

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.370
 and of course do not forget to subscribe to 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.970
 channel if everything was different I hope that 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:05.080
 can you find this fallen enemy and 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.080
