00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.620
 philip arena i think it is one of the most beautiful tracks ever &amp; lt 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.189
 very complete world I have incredible fear though - let's see though it is 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.179
 care of the professional stone guns you would be able to demarcate motorcycles 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.660
 let's start from a straight line that is that real significant difficulty because 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.180
 of nothing you do not help and downhill but it is not of surrounding 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.050
 much stairway of the bike means also sixth gear 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.420
 opens the curve is one of the tt if the world because the sixth slap 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.770
 fourth martial also become a help because 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.930
 graphics the cannelloni between ector quickly 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.880
 the entrance is very very fast 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.090
 it is at the center of care there are so many holes and it is important to go to gas soon 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.040
 have a good distance and rotating instrument to be able to stay very tight 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.360
 for 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.950
 to be idiots set well in the curvature sentence 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.130
 even the hard ass care changes radius several times but when you do it 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.440
 good to be able to maintain the solar line 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.420
 lend you much 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.070
 possible to be able not to exploit all horses up to turn 3 anyway 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.399
 retina of the dura three kings very difficult from what moves sentena because it does not have 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:28.930
 never completely straight and 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.990
 there is an up and down where you beat some fifth gear I love 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.090
 it is difficult to have a good end on the theory is very important 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.360
 go out 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.640
 to be quick to come out composed for the 4 hour sentence 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.540
 we pass from those beats to Marsala the first 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.740
 the circuit of where we can do is more brusque 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.910
 late overtaking 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.159
 the exit of the 4 curve gt always and however 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.560
 phishing first time nervous ie9 beautiful the moto2 continues 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.020
 circumvent limit before second and see will be for next time to brake 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.510
 always second gear for the cradle 5 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.910
 accuracy with anybody that brings you I always want to enter very tight. 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.509
 it's more important to stay a little wide for 

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:15.509
 we say to favor the exit 

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:19.379
 one of the most beautiful and traced points is very punctured 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.679
 difficult because there is field and need 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:25.739
 try to intoxicate the most possible second-third bike 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:30.519
 and fourth gear is too exaggerated the gears of the very nervous bike 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.679
 let's hope the curve 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:35.619
 6 7 colossus colossus on the right where 

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:39.609
 it is not easy because the bike moves a lot because it is a very damaged track 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:45.230
 It is also important to keep a good curve and exit with post 

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:47.359
 to have a good change of direction 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:51.219
 to best set curve greeted with long uphill where 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:53.389
 we move to the fourth other sarzana 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:56.189
 these difficult ceccanti are also a curve 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.579
 and it leads you to enter a bit wide and then exit 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.509
 best tavern away 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:05.829
 rampini says where it meets on March 1st 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.539
 last two curves 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:09.970
 they are very good however difficult 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.970
 gun to the hairpin turn discover third 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:16.399
 and then the third is held. in support 

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:19.399
 looking for me is a good distance 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.629
 to get the best out of the last corner 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.969
 between the two cores left houses laying fourth gear without 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:27.769
 without pulling it because 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.729
 it is important to set the curve well and go soon exasperating 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:34.169
 matera reality walking 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:35.619
 the last turn 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:39.479
 beautiful but also very difficult because the very ruined asphalt mini 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:43.969
 the bike moves so much impossible it must stay the bike sooner and better 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:46.969
 open gas as soon as possible to make fourth and fifth 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:48.519
 make a good g
