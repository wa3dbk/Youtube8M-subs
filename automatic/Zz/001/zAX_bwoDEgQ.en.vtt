00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.860
 considered montecarlo as a slow or small circuit the high command 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:15.409
 three rockets kilometers inside the city 78 bush I always felt 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:17.490
 kilometers in total 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.599
 five fast sections 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:21.359
 seven slow curves 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.630
 no overtaking ideal point maximum speed 266 kilometers per 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.480
 hour 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.800
 let's go around the red bull simulator in montecarlo 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.270
 the first curve of the circuit of montecarlo in third speed 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.270
 we show the complicated and you get a lot of speed seventh gear 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.510
 low this third and dealt with the assumption 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.460
 going upwards advances asphalt gave me to fund 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.840
 casino floor 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.840
 it's a very fast way 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.370
 and begins to download the whole area of ​​the casino in fourth speed 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.150
 and we reach the slowest area of 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.150
 the test is nothing of all 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.970
 proof of that 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.760
 180 degrees 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.760
 you tour everything practically 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.320
 it's a very very technical area 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.750
 we go before the tunnel 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.350
 first of all the tunnel to try to overtake in the first 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.730
 that day 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.530
 lung is very complicated 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.969
 today in 2nd gear 2nd 3rd montecarlo is a circuit very well 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.600
 we come to the appointment 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.880
 there is no one who does not have to follow the second line if you are in a hurry late 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.110
 entering the scratch 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.110
 first speed 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.810
 we rarely do it at 30 to 40 kilometers per hour on the last curve 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.870
 to finish that it is not at the entrance to the Monaco straight
