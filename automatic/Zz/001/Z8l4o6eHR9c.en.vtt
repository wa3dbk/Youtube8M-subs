00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.570
 cicadas sing 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.350
 that's the sign of summer that 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.390
 approach to to ben that's it's it's there 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.590
 we saw good and good morning and 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.500
 welcome to the why of how 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.359
 who goes into sun and pamiers mode 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.619
 this week it's true that with this 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.000
 weather getting warmer 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.800
 it makes you want to go to school 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.600
 truant and go read a good 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.280
 book at the waterfront not bah ah 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.079
 would also like is that you know 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.989
 that the expression do school 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.520
 truant to a religious origin 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.780
 tizi i assure you withdraw not like 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.950
 abc go I'll explain everything to you 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.899
 when we use this phrase we 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.820
 immediately think of children who 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.559
 deserted classrooms for 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.719
 to roll in the fields and play 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.789
 hides in the bushes and well 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.460
 not at all it's a bit more complicated 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.090
 that's going to the middle ages for everything 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.909
 understand 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.530
 at this time education is a luxury 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.570
 that few parents can offer to 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.220
 their children and it's the clergy who 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.920
 ensures the watches of the youngest to 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.119
 writing reading faith and 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.790
 business administration 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.520
 religious every cathedral churches 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.320
 abbeys and monasteries had his school 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.030
 which forms is predominantly 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.479
 children destined to enter the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.240
 orders 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.100
 but little by little external lay people 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.140
 join the teachings and the very 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.460
 increases for the education provided by 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.409
 church 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.210
 so around the 11th century in 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.360
 big cities like Paris the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.950
 cloister schools are overloaded then 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.200
 clerics who had completed their 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.850
 studies begin to build structures 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.470
 similar in each parish of the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.420
 city â€‹â€‹then in every neighborhood 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.579
 it's called small 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.740
 schools thought for little easy kids 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.270
 which was not particularly intended 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.340
 to priestly life 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.020
 it is the same teaching 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.880
 that in monastic schools or 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.640
 episcopal and because she was a 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.369
 initiative of the clergy the church had 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.390
 naturally the control in paris these 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.160
 structures were under the 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.810
 responsibility of the cantor of the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.090
 Notre Dame Cathedral 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.400
 the cantor is the name given to the 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.379
 who is in charge of 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.450
 sing and sing the assembly 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.549
 during the services but much more 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.599
 than a simple religious chorister the 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.379
 cantor had responsibilities 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:26.180
 important to the community 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:28.579
 among them there was the management of these 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.340
 small schools daily he was fixing the 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:33.079
 number of students she could receive 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.090
 enact rules of life ensure the 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:37.849
 respect for the liturgical time among others 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.890
 but this power is little by little very 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.019
 decried the masters and mistresses 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.849
 reproached in particular to the singers a 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.159
 fee he had to pay 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.290
 in fact all teachers and have 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.940
 access to the 50th of their income 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.680
 a tax that were intended for 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.859
 chanters of our lady of paris 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.750
 so to the diocese and it is to circumvent 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.370
 this fee that schools 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.849
 illegal immigrants were created in 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.920
 bushes 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.569
 finally more precisely in the forests 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.790
 the fields the vegetation of the surroundings 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.040
 what is it from that time 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.590
 we start talking in a pictorial way 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.329
 of school in the bushes but the 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.549
 phrase as we use it today 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.680
 it's really affirming around 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:19.250
 from the 16th century to the moment of appearance 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.199
 of Protestant doctrine to fight his 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.120
 disciples did not dare to preach nor 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:25.190
 teach this new stream in public 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.680
 and he had created clandestine schools 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.260
 sheltered by the nature that we called 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.510
 boxwood sauniÃ¨re and that's where it comes from 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.609
 the expression to skip school 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.530
 you still see that there is once 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.030
 more a slip of meaning because 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.440
 that today in the job to say 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.010
 to escape classrooms to 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.169
 the soft flow 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.449
 while at the base they are well and truly 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:46.459
 hiding appointments to study and 

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:48.859
 to live his faith without constraint 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.389
 now you know everything then 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:52.340
 without skipping school 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:54.169
 I wish you to enjoy 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.940
 the sunshine and I'll meet 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:57.590
 you next week for a new 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.949
 episode of the why of how 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.949
 bye
