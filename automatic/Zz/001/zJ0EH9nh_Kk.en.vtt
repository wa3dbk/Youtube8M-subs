water-soluble<00:01:56.719> silicone<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.899> did<00:01:58.229> my<00:01:58.469> research

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
water-soluble silicone I did my research

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.030 
water-soluble silicone I did my research
and<00:02:00.140> my<00:02:01.140> research<00:02:01.439> was<00:02:01.619> like<00:02:01.799> kind<00:02:01.950> of

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
and my research was like kind of

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.190 
and my research was like kind of
conflicting<00:02:02.460> some<00:02:02.939> said<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.360> was<00:02:03.570> was<00:02:03.990> water

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
conflicting some said it was was water

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.990 
conflicting some said it was was water
soluble<00:02:04.619> some<00:02:04.799> said<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.009> was<00:02:05.100> not<00:02:05.399> but<00:02:05.820> let's

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
soluble some said it was not but let's

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.130

just<00:02:06.090> go<00:02:06.270> ahead<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.420> get<00:02:06.540> into<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:06.840> review

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
just go ahead and get into this review

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.869 
just go ahead and get into this review
so<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.590> was<00:02:07.979> kind<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.190> iffy<00:02:08.340> for<00:02:08.459> me<00:02:08.700> because

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
so that was kind of iffy for me because

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.190 
so that was kind of iffy for me because
because<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.270> don't<00:02:09.539> have<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.750> real<00:02:10.050> good

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
because I don't have a real good

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.900 
because I don't have a real good
experience<00:02:10.649> with<00:02:10.679> silicones

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
formula says that you can it's a co-wash

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.690 
formula says that you can it's a co-wash
you<00:03:19.320> can<00:03:19.470> detangle<00:03:19.830> with<00:03:19.950> it<00:03:20.070> cleanse

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
you can detangle with it cleanse

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.550 
you can detangle with it cleanse
condition<00:03:21.360> and<00:03:21.510> detangle<00:03:22.110> that's<00:03:22.380> the

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
condition and detangle that's the

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.580 
condition and detangle that's the
three-in-one<00:03:22.970> so<00:03:23.970> here's<00:03:24.660> my<00:03:24.750> end<00:03:25.020> result<00:03:25.350> I

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
three-in-one so here's my end result I

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.070 
three-in-one so here's my end result I
was<00:03:26.490> used<00:03:26.760> i<00:03:26.910> use<00:03:27.060> this<00:03:27.150> product<00:03:27.420> a<00:03:27.600> lot<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:27.990> i

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
come together why this is weird and it

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.980 
come together why this is weird and it
was<00:04:24.419> then

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
was then

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.240 
was then
and<00:04:25.080> then<00:04:25.319> I<00:04:25.349> started<00:04:25.620> doing<00:04:25.710> research<00:04:25.889> on<00:04:26.220> the

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
and then I started doing research on the

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.650 
and then I started doing research on the
silicon<00:04:26.580> I<00:04:26.729> knew<00:04:26.880> there<00:04:27.000> was<00:04:27.120> a<00:04:27.150> silicone<00:04:27.509> in

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
silicon I knew there was a silicone in

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.240 
silicon I knew there was a silicone in
it<00:04:27.750> but<00:04:27.900> I<00:04:27.960> hadn't<00:04:28.319> done<00:04:28.380> my<00:04:28.530> own<00:04:28.560> research<00:04:28.680> yet

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
it but I hadn't done my own research yet

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.909 
it but I hadn't done my own research yet
to<00:04:29.819> prove<00:04:30.090> whether<00:04:30.419> or<00:04:30.539> not<00:04:30.720> its<00:04:31.139> water

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
to prove whether or not its water

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.659 
to prove whether or not its water
soluble<00:04:32.280> or<00:04:32.460> not<00:04:33.979> so<00:04:34.979> I<00:04:35.009> hadn't<00:04:35.310> done<00:04:35.370> that<00:04:35.430> so

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
soluble or not so I hadn't done that so

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.719 
soluble or not so I hadn't done that so
it<00:04:35.729> was<00:04:35.819> just<00:04:35.849> kind<00:04:36.000> of<00:04:36.180> like<00:04:36.360> okay<00:04:37.289> well<00:04:37.919> let

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
it was just kind of like okay well let

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.249 
it was just kind of like okay well let
me<00:04:38.759> go<00:04:38.940> do<00:04:39.060> my<00:04:39.180> research<00:04:39.330> now<00:04:39.630> and<00:04:39.870> see<00:04:39.990> if<00:04:40.020> it's

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 
me go do my research now and see if it's

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:41.900 
me go do my research now and see if it's
this<00:04:40.380> color<00:04:40.620> code<00:04:40.860> and<00:04:41.130> that's<00:04:41.550> what<00:04:41.699> I<00:04:41.729> found

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
this color code and that's what I found

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.430 
this color code and that's what I found
I<00:04:42.090> couldn't<00:04:42.330> find<00:04:42.599> anything<00:04:42.810> conclusive<00:04:43.349> I

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
I couldn't find anything conclusive I

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.620 
I couldn't find anything conclusive I
was<00:04:43.530> just<00:04:43.620> like<00:04:43.770> I<00:04:43.979> don't<00:04:44.400> know<00:04:44.550> it<00:04:45.060> is<00:04:45.330> it<00:04:45.509> or

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
was just like I don't know it is it or

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.309 
was just like I don't know it is it or
