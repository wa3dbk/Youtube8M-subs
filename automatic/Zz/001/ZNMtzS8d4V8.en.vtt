okay so anyway as you can see here this
is<00:00:19.830> straight<00:00:20.160> off<00:00:20.340> sort<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.240> stuff<00:00:21.449> that<00:00:21.570> we're

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
is straight off sort of stuff that we're

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.939 
is straight off sort of stuff that we're
gonna<00:00:21.750> see<00:00:21.989> I'll<00:00:22.320> tell<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.710> coordinates

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
gonna see I'll tell you the coordinates

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.490 
gonna see I'll tell you the coordinates
for<00:00:23.250> most<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:23.970> important<00:00:24.390> things<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.869> the

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
for most of the important things and the

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.200 
for most of the important things and the
stuff<00:00:25.769> that<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.099> won't<00:00:26.279> normally<00:00:26.460> find<00:00:26.970> and

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
stuff that you won't normally find and

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.299 
stuff that you won't normally find and
actually<00:00:27.390> extremely<00:00:28.079> rare<00:00:28.349> so<00:00:29.070> this<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.250> just

00:00:29.299 --> 00:00:29.309 
actually extremely rare so this is just

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:30.529 
actually extremely rare so this is just
one<00:00:29.519> place<00:00:29.699> but<00:00:29.880> we'll<00:00:29.970> come<00:00:30.119> back<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.419> this

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
one place but we'll come back to this

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.040 
one place but we'll come back to this
later

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
later

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.710 
later
so<00:00:31.169> anyway<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:32.399> start<00:00:32.669> off<00:00:32.790> we<00:00:33.059> are<00:00:33.090> going<00:00:33.360> to

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
so anyway to start off we are going to

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.450 
so anyway to start off we are going to
all<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:34.530> I'm<00:00:34.739> going<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.890> be<00:00:34.980> using<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.250> TP

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
all of this I'm going to be using the TP

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.220 
all of this I'm going to be using the TP
command<00:00:35.970> because<00:00:36.570> it's<00:00:36.720> kind<00:00:36.900> of<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.019> easiest

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
command because it's kind of the easiest

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.140 
command because it's kind of the easiest
way<00:00:37.379> to<00:00:37.409> get<00:00:37.589> around<00:00:37.650> so<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.460> recommend<00:00:39.089> if

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.150 
way to get around so I recommend if

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.729 
way to get around so I recommend if
you're<00:00:39.239> gonna<00:00:39.329> do<00:00:39.540> anything<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:40.199> this<00:00:40.350> map

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
you're gonna do anything on this map

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.219 
you're gonna do anything on this map
put<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.010> on<00:00:41.129> creative<00:00:41.579> then<00:00:42.269> T<00:00:42.720> beat<00:00:42.930> where<00:00:43.170> you

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:43.229 
put it on creative then T beat where you

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:45.049 
put it on creative then T beat where you
want<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.440> start<00:00:43.649> off<00:00:43.829> then<00:00:44.460> go<00:00:44.489> back<00:00:44.879> into

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
want to start off then go back into

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.910 
want to start off then go back into
survival<00:00:45.540> if<00:00:45.809> you'll<00:00:46.170> new<00:00:46.320> let's<00:00:46.530> play<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.800> on

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
survival if you'll new let's play it on

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.670 
survival if you'll new let's play it on
this<00:00:47.100> set<00:00:47.339> seed<00:00:47.610> or<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.120> ever<00:00:48.269> it<00:00:49.229> goes<00:00:49.290> first

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
this set seed or so ever it goes first

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.780 
this set seed or so ever it goes first
of<00:00:49.769> all<00:00:49.830> we<00:00:49.949> are<00:00:49.979> going<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.220> go<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.369> some<00:00:50.610> ice

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
of all we are going to go to some ice

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.719 
of all we are going to go to some ice
spiked<00:00:51.210> by<00:00:51.449> them<00:00:51.659> so<00:00:51.869> this<00:00:52.769> is<00:00:52.949> an<00:00:53.040> extremely

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:53.729 
spiked by them so this is an extremely

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:54.999 
spiked by them so this is an extremely
rare<00:00:54.089> biome

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:55.009 
rare biome

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:58.329 
rare biome
however<00:00:56.009> on<00:00:56.430> here<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.299> can<00:00:57.449> find<00:00:57.689> it<00:00:57.839> at<00:00:57.989> these

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
however on here you can find it at these

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:01.999 
however on here you can find it at these
TP<00:00:59.339> 2<00:00:59.549> 2<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.150> negative<00:01:00.420> 200<00:01:01.049> 100<00:01:01.559> high<00:01:01.680> and

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:02.009 
TP 2 2 and negative 200 100 high and

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:05.260 
TP 2 2 and negative 200 100 high and
then<00:01:02.250> negative<00:01:03.019> 2050<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.170> if<00:01:04.229> we<00:01:04.290> click<00:01:04.379> enter

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
then negative 2050 so if we click enter

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.480 
then negative 2050 so if we click enter
here<00:01:06.270> we<00:01:06.450> go<00:01:06.570> we<00:01:06.930> are<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> centre<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.799> I

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
here we go we are in the centre of I

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.399 
here we go we are in the centre of I
spiked<00:01:09.299> volume<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.840> can<00:01:09.990> see<00:01:10.110> here<00:01:10.290> this

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
spiked volume so you can see here this

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.830 
spiked volume so you can see here this
is<00:01:10.470> compact<00:01:11.040> ice<00:01:11.340> which<00:01:11.850> isn't<00:01:12.030> just<00:01:12.390> like

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
is compact ice which isn't just like

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.200 
is compact ice which isn't just like
normal<00:01:13.200> stuff<00:01:13.290> just<00:01:13.590> kind<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:14.210> not

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
normal stuff just kind of not

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.030 
normal stuff just kind of not
see-through<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.990> but<00:01:16.409> yes<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.829> is<00:01:16.890> an

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
see-through and but yes so this is an

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.420 
see-through and but yes so this is an
awesome<00:01:17.159> biome<00:01:17.670> anyway<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:19.100> really<00:01:20.100> like<00:01:20.220> it

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
awesome biome anyway I really like it

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.219 
awesome biome anyway I really like it
never<00:01:20.640> done<00:01:21.270> anything<00:01:21.509> here<00:01:21.869> because<00:01:22.170> I've

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
never done anything here because I've

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.749 
never done anything here because I've
never<00:01:22.350> found<00:01:22.590> one<00:01:22.740> before<00:01:23.069> however<00:01:23.249> this<00:01:23.520> seed

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
never found one before however this seed

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.849 
never found one before however this seed
here<00:01:24.210> we<00:01:24.299> go<00:01:24.420> you've<00:01:24.600> got<00:01:24.749> one<00:01:24.929> so<00:01:25.770> that's

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:25.859 
here we go you've got one so that's

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:28.370 
here we go you've got one so that's
really<00:01:26.069> useful<00:01:26.810> okay<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:27.869> next<00:01:28.049> what<00:01:28.289> I'm

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
really useful okay so next what I'm

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.899 
really useful okay so next what I'm
going<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.560> show<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.859> mess<00:01:29.249> and<00:01:29.490> savanna

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
going to show you a mess and savanna

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.669 
going to show you a mess and savanna
biome<00:01:30.149> they're<00:01:30.450> kind<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.749> next<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.469> each<00:01:31.560> other

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:31.679 
biome they're kind of next to each other

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:33.859 
biome they're kind of next to each other
mixed<00:01:32.189> together<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.880> what<00:01:33.030> you'll<00:01:33.119> do<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.329> TP<00:01:33.659> 0

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
mixed together so what you'll do is TP 0

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.099 
mixed together so what you'll do is TP 0
100<00:01:34.530> 0<00:01:34.770> which<00:01:35.039> is<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.310> just<00:01:35.969> zero<00:01:36.179> it's<00:01:36.929> the

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:37.109 
100 0 which is it just zero it's the

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:39.889 
100 0 which is it just zero it's the
exact<00:01:37.530> center<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.490> if<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.819> see<00:01:39.270> we<00:01:39.600> all<00:01:39.749> be

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
exact center so if you see we all be

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.690 
exact center so if you see we all be
straight<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.439> desert<00:01:40.649> however<00:01:41.369> if<00:01:41.429> you<00:01:41.549> come

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
straight in a desert however if you come

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.389 
straight in a desert however if you come
over<00:01:41.729> here<00:01:42.090> where<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:42.869> see<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.799> mess<00:01:44.219> of

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
over here where you can see the mess of

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.809 
over here where you can see the mess of
biome<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:46.819> then<00:01:47.819> just<00:01:48.240> let<00:01:48.389> it<00:01:48.539> render<00:01:49.819> ok

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
biome and then just let it render ok

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:52.309 
biome and then just let it render ok
guys<00:01:50.969> so<00:01:51.149> as<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.359> can<00:01:51.450> see<00:01:51.539> I've<00:01:51.659> clicked<00:01:51.840> f3

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
guys so as you can see I've clicked f3

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:55.279 
guys so as you can see I've clicked f3
and<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.709> says<00:01:53.009> mess<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.549> biome<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:54.990> can<00:01:55.109> see

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
and it says mess of biome so you can see

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:56.690 
and it says mess of biome so you can see
the<00:01:55.469> mess<00:01:55.590> environment<00:01:56.039> also<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.579> will<00:01:56.639> give

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
the mess environment also it will give

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.789 
the mess environment also it will give
if<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.179> want<00:01:57.509> now<00:01:57.749> we<00:01:57.810> use<00:01:58.020> f3<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.709> would

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
if you want now we use f3 and it would

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.709 
if you want now we use f3 and it would
describe<00:01:59.130> every<00:01:59.670> so<00:02:00.029> now<00:02:00.149> we're<00:02:00.299> on<00:02:00.389> mass<00:02:00.569> of

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
describe every so now we're on mass of

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.080 
describe every so now we're on mass of
letter<00:02:00.929> F<00:02:01.319> as<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.759> really<00:02:02.969> useful

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
letter F as and this is really useful

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.910 
letter F as and this is really useful
every<00:02:03.509> now<00:02:03.659> time<00:02:03.929> to<00:02:04.079> see<00:02:04.259> where<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.529> are<00:02:04.590> and

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
every now time to see where you are and

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.709 
every now time to see where you are and
all<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.700> wasn't<00:02:06.029> useful<00:02:06.149> before

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
all that wasn't useful before

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.240 
all that wasn't useful before
so<00:02:07.020> then<00:02:07.139> desert<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.740> now<00:02:07.950> we're<00:02:08.069> in<00:02:08.130> the

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
so then desert and now we're in the

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.370 
so then desert and now we're in the
savanna<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:09.360> yet<00:02:09.630> this<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:09.959> really<00:02:10.229> cool

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
savanna so yet this is a really cool

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.690 
savanna so yet this is a really cool
point<00:02:10.619> in<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.950> map<00:02:11.069> as<00:02:11.220> well<00:02:11.370> if<00:02:11.550> you're

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
point in the map as well if you're

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.190 
point in the map as well if you're
interested<00:02:11.760> in<00:02:12.240> both<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.420> these<00:02:12.660> seeds<00:02:12.959> and

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
interested in both of these seeds and

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.080 
interested in both of these seeds and
the<00:02:13.319> desert<00:02:13.620> altogether<00:02:14.040> actually<00:02:14.849> really

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
the desert altogether actually really

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.160 
the desert altogether actually really
quite<00:02:15.270> useful<00:02:17.030> okay<00:02:18.030> so<00:02:18.090> also<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.660> add<00:02:18.990> all

this up together this exact 0 100 500 we
have<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:23.720> mushroom<00:02:24.720> biome<00:02:25.020> ok<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.220> is

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
have a mushroom biome ok so this is

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.250 
have a mushroom biome ok so this is
actually<00:02:26.580> awesome<00:02:27.510> we've<00:02:27.630> got<00:02:27.780> all<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.110> new

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
Minecraft like naturally I've had to

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.910 
Minecraft like naturally I've had to
have<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.300> TP<00:02:39.630> 2<00:02:39.780> somewhere<00:02:39.930> or<00:02:40.170> find<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.560> special

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
1050 180 4600 you will get the swampland

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.350 
1050 180 4600 you will get the swampland
however<00:03:46.440> this<00:03:46.650> is<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:47.220> only<00:03:47.460> swampland<00:03:48.030> which

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
however this is the only swampland which

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.710 
however this is the only swampland which
is<00:03:48.540> in<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:49.170> radius<00:03:49.850> well<00:03:50.850> of<00:03:51.060> all<00:03:51.420> of<00:03:51.570> these

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
is in the radius well of all of these

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.630 
is in the radius well of all of these
other<00:03:51.900> biomes<00:03:52.320> says<00:03:52.590> it's<00:03:52.890> not<00:03:53.040> a<00:03:53.070> small<00:03:53.400> but

I like to have I'm a fan of building

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.800 
I like to have I'm a fan of building
treehouses<00:05:40.889> about<00:05:41.490> Minecraft<00:05:42.120> so<00:05:42.270> what<00:05:42.719> I'd

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
treehouses about Minecraft so what I'd

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.749 
treehouses about Minecraft so what I'd
probably<00:05:42.990> do<00:05:43.259> is<00:05:43.439> have<00:05:43.560> a<00:05:43.620> treehouse<00:05:43.830> inside

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 
probably do is have a treehouse inside

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:46.639 
probably do is have a treehouse inside
this<00:05:44.879> tree<00:05:45.180> and<00:05:45.389> then<00:05:45.839> you<00:05:45.990> right<00:05:46.229> next<00:05:46.500> to<00:05:46.589> all

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:46.649 
this tree and then you right next to all

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:49.010 
this tree and then you right next to all
the<00:05:46.770> stained<00:05:47.039> clay<00:05:47.370> and<00:05:47.699> the<00:05:47.939> desert<00:05:48.330> and<00:05:48.539> you
