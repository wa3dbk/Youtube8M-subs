seeds indoors the main reason why you

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.410 
seeds indoors the main reason why you
would<00:00:11.070> want<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.429> plant<00:00:11.670> sunflower<00:00:12.090> seeds

would want to plant sunflower seeds
indoors<00:00:12.660> is<00:00:13.170> if<00:00:13.380> your<00:00:13.590> outdoor<00:00:14.130> temperature

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
indoors is if your outdoor temperature

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.340 
indoors is if your outdoor temperature
ranges<00:00:15.630> are<00:00:16.220> in<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.369> 50s<00:00:17.820> or<00:00:18.180> lower<00:00:18.480> good

temperature range for seed germination

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.859 
temperature range for seed germination
in<00:00:21.720> general<00:00:22.199> is<00:00:22.470> roughly<00:00:23.000> from<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.090> upper<00:00:24.330> 60s

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
in general is roughly from the upper 60s

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.509 
in general is roughly from the upper 60s
to<00:00:25.640> about<00:00:26.640> low<00:00:27.150> 80s<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.080> that's<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.380> round<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.980> 15

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
to about low 80s so that's a round of 15

where outdoor temperatures may not be
ideal<00:00:47.450> the<00:00:48.450> thing<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.750> consider<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.379> you

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
ideal the thing to consider is that you

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.260 
ideal the thing to consider is that you
want<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.860> find<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.219> place<00:00:50.460> where<00:00:50.789> you're<00:00:51.030> going

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
want to find a place where you're going

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.810 
want to find a place where you're going
to<00:00:51.449> have<00:00:52.460> temperatures<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.760> are

to have temperatures that are

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.170 
to have temperatures that are
consistently<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.590> upper<00:00:55.949> 60s<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.699> low

just put some good potting soil in and

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.340 
just put some good potting soil in and
make<00:01:41.970> sure<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.570> did<00:01:42.750> not<00:01:42.869> plant<00:01:43.170> your

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
depth of your fingernail it's a really

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.190 
depth of your fingernail it's a really
great<00:01:52.740> gauge<00:01:53.070> for<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.570> know<00:01:54.750> just<00:01:55.079> how

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
great gauge for you to to know just how

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.230

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
deeply you're planting a seed and it's

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.609 
deeply you're planting a seed and it's
really<00:01:57.509> one<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.869> things<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.409> can<00:01:58.560> go

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
really one of the things that can go

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.340 
really one of the things that can go
wrong<00:01:58.909> as<00:01:59.909> far<00:02:00.270> as<00:02:00.479> success<00:02:00.990> with<00:02:01.229> your

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
germinating endeavors so make sure that

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.440 
germinating endeavors so make sure that
you<00:02:04.680> never<00:02:04.829> plant<00:02:05.189> your<00:02:05.369> seeds<00:02:05.670> more<00:02:06.000> deeply

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
you never plant your seeds more deeply
