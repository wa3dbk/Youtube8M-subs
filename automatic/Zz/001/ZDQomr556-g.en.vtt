00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.660 

this<00:00:01.650> one<00:00:01.949> is<00:00:02.159> called<00:00:02.250> boo<00:00:03.149> too<00:00:03.720> and<00:00:04.710> it's<00:00:05.490> a

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
this one is called boo too and it's a

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.200 
this one is called boo too and it's a
pretty<00:00:05.850> complicated<00:00:06.120> little<00:00:06.779> track<00:00:08.000> as<00:00:09.000> you

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
pretty complicated little track as you

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.749 
pretty complicated little track as you
can<00:00:09.330> see<00:00:09.630> by<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.080> replay<00:00:10.590> counter<00:00:10.980> my<00:00:11.219> time<00:00:11.519> is

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
can see by the replay counter my time is

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.150 
can see by the replay counter my time is
pretty<00:00:12.090> damn<00:00:12.240> terrible<00:00:12.809> I'm<00:00:13.710> not<00:00:13.860> sure<00:00:14.040> if

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
pretty damn terrible I'm not sure if

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.430 
pretty damn terrible I'm not sure if
that's<00:00:14.250> because<00:00:14.429> I<00:00:14.670> picked<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.260> longer<00:00:16.260> more

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
that's because I picked a longer more

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.730 
that's because I picked a longer more
difficult<00:00:16.890> way<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.100> go<00:00:17.400> or<00:00:17.760> what<00:00:18.320> but<00:00:19.320> I'm

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
difficult way to go or what but I'm

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.960 
difficult way to go or what but I'm
guessing<00:00:19.949> it's<00:00:20.189> probably<00:00:20.250> more<00:00:20.550> accurately

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
guessing it's probably more accurately

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.880 
guessing it's probably more accurately
because<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.270> just<00:00:21.600> suck<00:00:22.109> at<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:22.380> game<00:00:22.439> and

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
because I just suck at this game and

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.450 
because I just suck at this game and
yeah<00:00:23.880> I'm<00:00:24.150> pretty<00:00:24.449> terrible<00:00:24.900> really

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.849 

I<00:00:27.580> did<00:00:28.119> however<00:00:28.210> make<00:00:28.539> it<00:00:28.660> to<00:00:28.720> the<00:00:28.810> end<00:00:28.960> so<00:00:29.470> let

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:29.859 
I did however make it to the end so let

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.389 
I did however make it to the end so let
this<00:00:30.009> to<00:00:30.160> my<00:00:30.279> credit<00:00:30.490> I<00:00:30.669> guess<00:00:32.100> as<00:00:33.100> you<00:00:33.250> might

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399 
this to my credit I guess as you might

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:34.799 
this to my credit I guess as you might
have<00:00:33.489> guessed<00:00:33.550> driving<00:00:34.120> into<00:00:34.270> the<00:00:34.360> water<00:00:34.540> will

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
have guessed driving into the water will

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:40.930 
have guessed driving into the water will
kill<00:00:35.050> you<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:37.570> kind<00:00:37.780> of<00:00:37.840> sucks

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.520 

but

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.350 

it<00:00:47.070> could<00:00:47.280> be<00:00:47.460> worse

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.150 

and<00:00:50.930> that<00:00:51.050> I<00:00:51.080> could<00:00:51.260> be<00:00:51.350> crashing<00:00:51.770> into<00:00:51.830> walls

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
and that I could be crashing into walls

00:00:52.160 --> 00:01:00.100 
and that I could be crashing into walls
and<00:00:52.430> dying<00:00:52.640> right<00:00:52.880> now<00:00:52.940> but<00:00:53.300> I'm<00:00:53.390> not

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.320 

I<00:01:00.170> changed<00:01:01.010> my<00:01:01.070> sound<00:01:01.430> effects<00:01:01.760> coincidental

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.330 
I changed my sound effects coincidental

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.820 
I changed my sound effects coincidental
way<00:01:02.390> so<00:01:02.450> any<00:01:02.690> more<00:01:02.870> crash<00:01:03.140> videos<00:01:03.500> won't<00:01:03.680> sound

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
way so any more crash videos won't sound

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.260 
way so any more crash videos won't sound
like<00:01:03.980> a<00:01:04.010> piano<00:01:05.050> and<00:01:06.050> a<00:01:06.170> few<00:01:06.320> guys<00:01:06.380> act<00:01:06.650> well

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
like a piano and a few guys act well

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.460 
like a piano and a few guys act well
somewhat<00:01:08.270> accurate<00:01:08.420> sounding<00:01:08.960> motor<00:01:09.170> sound

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
somewhat accurate sounding motor sound

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.870 
somewhat accurate sounding motor sound
do<00:01:09.680> know<00:01:09.830> you<00:01:09.980> can't<00:01:10.040> really<00:01:10.250> hear<00:01:10.580> them<00:01:10.760> in

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
do know you can't really hear them in

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:18.640 
do know you can't really hear them in
this<00:01:11.000> video<00:01:11.240> for<00:01:11.480> some<00:01:11.630> reason

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.500 

this<00:01:19.190> track<00:01:19.520> really<00:01:19.850> likes<00:01:20.060> its<00:01:20.240> raised

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
this track really likes its raised

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.360 
this track really likes its raised
sections<00:01:21.110> and<00:01:21.380> I<00:01:21.500> don't<00:01:21.740> like<00:01:21.890> that<00:01:22.070> very<00:01:22.250> much

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
sections and I don't like that very much

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.340 
sections and I don't like that very much
because<00:01:22.760> I'm<00:01:22.940> not<00:01:23.090> a<00:01:23.150> fan<00:01:23.450> of<00:01:23.480> raised<00:01:23.930> track

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
because I'm not a fan of raised track

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:31.310 
because I'm not a fan of raised track
sections<00:01:26.500> especially<00:01:27.500> these<00:01:27.650> damn<00:01:27.950> things

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.190 

I<00:01:31.409> hate<00:01:32.159> these<00:01:32.340> things<00:01:32.400> with<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.880> vengeance

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.600 

now<00:01:36.770> i'm<00:01:36.860> not<00:01:37.009> sure<00:01:37.159> why<00:01:37.340> that<00:01:37.369> didn't<00:01:37.820> kill<00:01:38.000> me

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.840 

I<00:01:40.700> guess<00:01:41.270> I<00:01:41.360> wasn't<00:01:41.510> going<00:01:41.690> fast<00:01:41.930> enough<00:01:42.850> now

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
I guess I wasn't going fast enough now

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.430 
I guess I wasn't going fast enough now
this<00:01:43.970> is<00:01:44.120> a<00:01:44.150> trend<00:01:44.450> that<00:01:44.630> is<00:01:44.810> starting<00:01:45.080> to<00:01:45.320> make

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
this is a trend that is starting to make

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.230 
this is a trend that is starting to make
me<00:01:45.620> dread<00:01:45.950> starting<00:01:46.370> this<00:01:46.460> whole<00:01:46.640> thing<00:01:46.820> up<00:01:46.940> a

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
me dread starting this whole thing up a

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.540 
me dread starting this whole thing up a
lot<00:01:48.050> of<00:01:48.080> tracks<00:01:48.410> i've<00:01:48.650> seen<00:01:48.860> lately<00:01:49.100> I've<00:01:49.370> had

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
lot of tracks i've seen lately I've had

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:56.160 
lot of tracks i've seen lately I've had
doubles<00:01:50.090> of<00:01:50.420> these<00:01:50.570> guys<00:01:50.870> back-to-back<00:01:51.470> and

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.249 

that<00:01:56.770> is<00:01:56.920> not<00:01:57.070> friendly<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:58.630> does<00:01:58.780> not<00:01:58.930> make<00:01:59.110> me

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
that is not friendly it does not make me

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.700 
that is not friendly it does not make me
happy

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.940 

but<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.340> still<00:02:02.729> deal<00:02:02.970> with<00:02:03.000> them

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
but I still deal with them

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.719 
but I still deal with them
because<00:02:05.729> i<00:02:05.939> am<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.119> stunt<00:02:06.450> car<00:02:06.719> driver<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.729> that

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
because i am a stunt car driver and that

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:22.100 
because i am a stunt car driver and that
is<00:02:08.910> what<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.090> stunt<00:02:09.479> car<00:02:09.690> drivers<00:02:10.110> do<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:11.360> guess

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.720 

I<00:02:22.200> was<00:02:22.890> like<00:02:23.010> this<00:02:23.100> I<00:02:23.280> should<00:02:23.490> have<00:02:23.580> known

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
I was like this I should have known

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.280 
I was like this I should have known
better<00:02:23.880> I<00:02:24.090> did<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.360> clearly<00:02:24.900> didn't<00:02:25.200> learn

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
better I did I clearly didn't learn

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.730 
better I did I clearly didn't learn
anything<00:02:25.590> from<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:26.930> crack<00:02:27.930> video<00:02:28.170> i<00:02:28.350> posted

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
anything from the crack video i posted

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.340 
anything from the crack video i posted
earlier<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.700> I<00:02:30.360> rock<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:30.870> jump<00:02:31.050> right<00:02:31.140> into

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
earlier and I rock and jump right into

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.930 
earlier and I rock and jump right into
the<00:02:31.470> edge<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.770> level<00:02:32.010> i<00:02:32.160> used<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.730> i

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
the edge of the level i used to i

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.160 
the edge of the level i used to i
thought<00:02:33.150> that<00:02:33.300> killed<00:02:33.600> you<00:02:33.750> but<00:02:33.930> i<00:02:33.960> guess<00:02:33.990> it

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
thought that killed you but i guess it

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.150 
thought that killed you but i guess it
just<00:02:34.200> stops<00:02:34.590> you<00:02:35.450> bubbles<00:02:36.450> in<00:02:36.600> i<00:02:36.890> found<00:02:37.890> my<00:02:38.040> way

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
just stops you bubbles in i found my way

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.400 
just stops you bubbles in i found my way
back<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.460> where<00:02:38.580> i<00:02:38.610> should<00:02:38.700> have<00:02:38.940> been

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:50.190 

and<00:02:42.650> we<00:02:43.310> continue<00:02:43.790> on

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.380 

trying<00:02:50.860> to<00:02:50.950> make<00:02:51.040> up<00:02:51.190> lost<00:02:51.400> time<00:02:51.610> my<00:02:52.060> building

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
trying to make up lost time my building

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.160 
trying to make up lost time my building
up<00:02:52.510> speed<00:02:52.660> and<00:02:53.200> then<00:02:54.120> we<00:02:55.120> jump<00:02:55.420> a<00:02:55.660> building<00:02:56.790> and

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
up speed and then we jump a building and

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.690 
up speed and then we jump a building and
then<00:02:59.170> I<00:02:59.290> lose<00:02:59.560> all<00:02:59.769> my<00:02:59.830> speed<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.340> go<00:03:00.550> around

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
then I lose all my speed to go around

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.490 
then I lose all my speed to go around
the<00:03:00.819> curve<00:03:01.060> because<00:03:01.480> I<00:03:01.629> try<00:03:01.870> not<00:03:01.989> to<00:03:02.050> go<00:03:02.230> flying

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
the curve because I try not to go flying

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.720 
the curve because I try not to go flying
out<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.769> track<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:03.340> I<00:03:03.430> fail<00:03:03.700> anyway<00:03:05.550> this<00:03:06.550> is

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
out the track and I fail anyway this is

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:18.420 
out the track and I fail anyway this is
why<00:03:06.880> I'm<00:03:07.060> bad<00:03:07.330> at<00:03:07.510> this<00:03:07.630> game

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.369 

now<00:03:18.969> once<00:03:19.180> again<00:03:19.420> I<00:03:19.450> didn't<00:03:19.750> learn<00:03:19.870> my<00:03:20.049> lesson

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379 
now once again I didn't learn my lesson

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:24.910 
now once again I didn't learn my lesson
but<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:20.620> doesn't<00:03:20.890> affect<00:03:21.099> me<00:03:21.250> this<00:03:21.400> time

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.740 

there's<00:03:25.610> kind<00:03:25.790> of<00:03:25.849> let's<00:03:26.090> track<00:03:26.270> it<00:03:26.390> a<00:03:26.450> lot<00:03:26.630> of

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
there's kind of let's track it a lot of

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.360 
there's kind of let's track it a lot of
branching<00:03:27.290> paths<00:03:27.560> I<00:03:27.890> didn't<00:03:28.160> see<00:03:30.160> let's<00:03:31.160> try

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
branching paths I didn't see let's try

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.610 
branching paths I didn't see let's try
it<00:03:31.430> again<00:03:31.489> I<00:03:31.910> do<00:03:32.720> like<00:03:32.870> the<00:03:32.930> jump<00:03:33.260> from<00:03:33.440> higher

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
it again I do like the jump from higher

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
it again I do like the jump from higher
to<00:03:33.650> lower<00:03:33.830> though<00:03:34.190> I<00:03:34.220> was<00:03:34.459> pretty<00:03:34.580> cool

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.490 

and<00:03:41.030> again<00:03:41.510> I<00:03:41.540> thought<00:03:41.750> about<00:03:41.930> you<00:03:42.050> still

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
and again I thought about you still

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.130 
and again I thought about you still
doing<00:03:43.190> a<00:03:43.280> full<00:03:43.490> 360<00:03:44.210> around<00:03:44.300> the<00:03:44.540> tube<00:03:44.720> inside

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
doing a full 360 around the tube inside

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:52.300 
doing a full 360 around the tube inside
now<00:03:45.380> too

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.030 

and<00:03:52.880> good<00:03:53.090> old<00:03:53.150> bank<00:03:53.569> curves<00:03:53.959> how<00:03:54.560> I<00:03:54.590> love<00:03:54.980> my

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
and good old bank curves how I love my

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.070 
and good old bank curves how I love my
bank<00:03:55.550> curves<00:03:57.459> and<00:03:58.459> we<00:03:59.030> jumped<00:03:59.360> to<00:03:59.660> the<00:03:59.750> finish

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
bank curves and we jumped to the finish

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.920 
bank curves and we jumped to the finish
the<00:04:00.709> end
