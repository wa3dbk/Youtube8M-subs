is one that you're going to be using

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.870 
is one that you're going to be using
often<00:00:16.810> so<00:00:17.050> I<00:00:17.080> suggest<00:00:17.500> memorizing<00:00:18.100> it<00:00:18.160> so<00:00:18.849> I

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
often so I suggest memorizing it so I

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.640

the uses of the free transform tool is

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.969 
the uses of the free transform tool is
to<00:02:03.819> copy<00:02:04.090> shapes<00:02:04.600> so<00:02:05.200> let's<00:02:05.380> say<00:02:05.560> I<00:02:05.590> wanted<00:02:05.859> to
