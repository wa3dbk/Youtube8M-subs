another truck an unmarked cargo truck
that<00:04:00.680> was<00:04:00.829> probably<00:04:01.189> not<00:04:01.760> as<00:04:01.939> big<00:04:02.120> as<00:04:02.299> ours<00:04:02.540> but

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:02.689 
that was probably not as big as ours but

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:06.819 
that was probably not as big as ours but
it<00:04:03.140> was<00:04:03.290> big<00:04:03.590> he<00:04:04.120> was<00:04:05.120> sitting<00:04:05.659> on<00:04:05.810> top<00:04:06.140> of<00:04:06.200> the

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
it was big he was sitting on top of the

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:08.949 
it was big he was sitting on top of the
guardrail<00:04:07.400> as<00:04:07.730> though<00:04:08.030> he<00:04:08.329> had<00:04:08.420> done<00:04:08.629> like<00:04:08.780> us

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
guardrail as though he had done like us

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.160 
guardrail as though he had done like us
like<00:04:09.650> a<00:04:09.920> rail<00:04:10.370> grind<00:04:10.790> on<00:04:11.090> a<00:04:11.120> skateboard<00:04:11.780> but

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
like a rail grind on a skateboard but

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.190 
like a rail grind on a skateboard but
not<00:04:13.069> sideways<00:04:13.909> it<00:04:14.180> was<00:04:14.299> he<00:04:14.569> was<00:04:14.689> just<00:04:14.720> full-on

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
not sideways it was he was just full-on

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.069 
not sideways it was he was just full-on
and<00:04:15.950> it<00:04:16.400> looks<00:04:16.699> like<00:04:16.910> he<00:04:17.120> had<00:04:17.209> been<00:04:17.239> up<00:04:17.720> on<00:04:17.930> the

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
and it looks like he had been up on the

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.610 
and it looks like he had been up on the
rail<00:04:18.259> for<00:04:18.680> a<00:04:18.739> good<00:04:19.100> what<00:04:19.970> 100<00:04:20.539> yards<00:04:20.870> leave<00:04:21.350> at

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
rail for a good what 100 yards leave at

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.700 
rail for a good what 100 yards leave at
least<00:04:21.949> 100<00:04:22.460> yards<00:04:22.820> and<00:04:23.030> it<00:04:23.479> was<00:04:23.840> horrifying

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
least 100 yards and it was horrifying

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.129 
least 100 yards and it was horrifying
but<00:04:25.160> also<00:04:25.850> impressive<00:04:26.270> because<00:04:26.570> he<00:04:26.840> was<00:04:26.990> out

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
but also impressive because he was out

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.029 
but also impressive because he was out
moving<00:04:27.620> around<00:04:27.800> looking<00:04:28.280> a<00:04:28.610> little<00:04:28.789> forlorn

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
moving around looking a little forlorn

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:32.080 
moving around looking a little forlorn
that's<00:04:31.039> something<00:04:31.430> you<00:04:31.520> don't<00:04:31.610> see<00:04:31.729> every<00:04:32.060> day

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
that's something you don't see every day

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.650 
that's something you don't see every day
and<00:04:32.930> I'm<00:04:33.199> just<00:04:33.229> gonna<00:04:33.530> attribute<00:04:34.010> that<00:04:34.190> to

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
and I'm just gonna attribute that to

00:04:34.660 --> 00:05:10.670 
and I'm just gonna attribute that to
Texas
