right yes so a smaller bezel ocean they

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.900 
right yes so a smaller bezel ocean they
need<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.900> put<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.080> 3G<00:00:31.439> here<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.669> future

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
need to put a 3G here and in the future

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.530 
need to put a 3G here and in the future
now<00:00:33.180> we<00:00:33.239> also<00:00:33.510> support<00:00:34.550> 4G<00:00:35.550> can<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.180> open<00:00:36.270> air

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
now we also support 4G can you open air

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.930 
now we also support 4G can you open air
so<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.739> first<00:00:38.160> with<00:00:38.370> ultra-stick

so this is the first with ultra-stick
exhaustive<00:00:39.629> then<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:41.180> SIM<00:00:42.180> card<00:00:42.390> here<00:00:43.399> and

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
exhaustive then this SIM card here and

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.170 
exhaustive then this SIM card here and
this<00:00:44.579> one<00:00:44.700> even<00:00:44.730> have<00:00:45.090> has<00:00:45.809> MHL<00:00:46.670> now<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.969> put

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.210 

and<00:02:27.480> then<00:02:27.660> we<00:02:27.890> just<00:02:28.890> launched<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.540> 4G<00:02:30.540> LTE

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
and then we just launched a 4G LTE

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.470 
and then we just launched a 4G LTE
tablet<00:02:32.220> with<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.640> forged<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.380> 10.1<00:02:34.380> inch<00:02:35.480> 10.1
