softer with that made some some changes
in<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:38.130> handle<00:01:38.610> itself<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:39.030> make<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.420> better

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
in the handle itself to make a better

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.100 
in the handle itself to make a better
purchase<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.650> better<00:01:40.829> grip<00:01:41.299> now<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:43.049> other

purchase and a better grip now the other

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.960 
purchase and a better grip now the other
thing<00:01:43.200> about<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.770> he's<00:01:44.250> chosen<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.759> high

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
thing about this is he's chosen a high

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.120 
thing about this is he's chosen a high
carbon<00:01:45.390> steel<00:01:45.420> for<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.380> one<00:01:46.590> version<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.009> this

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
carbon steel for a one version of this

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.410 
carbon steel for a one version of this

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
what I've seen for any of his touch-up

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.100 
what I've seen for any of his touch-up
work<00:02:02.670> before<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.060> ships<00:02:03.210> these<00:02:03.420> out<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.780> of

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
work before it ships these out and of

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.870 
work before it ships these out and of
course<00:02:04.140> this<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.680> first<00:02:05.009> batch<00:02:05.250> prototype

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
course this is the first batch prototype

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.520 
course this is the first batch prototype
I<00:02:06.000> think<00:02:06.180> there's<00:02:06.329> 20<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:06.810> 30<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.110> these<00:02:07.290> so<00:02:07.500> I

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
I think there's 20 to 30 of these so I

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.980 
I think there's 20 to 30 of these so I
was<00:02:07.649> lucky<00:02:07.860> enough<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.099> get<00:02:08.220> one<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.489> these

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
was lucky enough to get one of these

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.990 
was lucky enough to get one of these
now<00:02:09.500> one<00:02:09.890> thing<00:02:09.920> I<00:02:10.100> have<00:02:10.190> to<00:02:10.220> say<00:02:10.310> is<00:02:10.610> this

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
now one thing I have to say is this

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.120 
now one thing I have to say is this
speaks<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.540> me<00:02:11.750> a<00:02:11.780> certain<00:02:12.080> way<00:02:12.170> this<00:02:12.950> is<00:02:13.100> a

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
speaks to me a certain way this is a

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.340 
speaks to me a certain way this is a
little<00:02:13.400> bit<00:02:13.550> higher<00:02:13.790> value<00:02:14.660> than<00:02:14.930> something

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
little bit higher value than something

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.370 
little bit higher value than something
like<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.620> mora<00:02:15.860> but<00:02:16.760> I<00:02:16.790> think<00:02:17.090> if<00:02:17.240> you<00:02:17.630> like<00:02:18.170> that

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
like a mora but I think if you like that

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.320 
like a mora but I think if you like that
simple<00:02:18.800> yet<00:02:19.010> elegant<00:02:19.190> style<00:02:19.790> of<00:02:20.000> a<00:02:20.090> blade<00:02:20.300> that

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
simple yet elegant style of a blade that

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.180 
simple yet elegant style of a blade that
Kimura<00:02:20.780> this<00:02:21.230> is<00:02:21.380> something<00:02:21.680> that<00:02:21.770> is<00:02:22.010> going

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
Kimura this is something that is going

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.800 
Kimura this is something that is going
to<00:02:22.280> be<00:02:22.340> a<00:02:22.370> must-have<00:02:22.790> for<00:02:22.850> you<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.570> price

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
to be a must-have for you the price

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.510 
to be a must-have for you the price
point<00:02:24.050> at<00:02:24.200> about<00:02:24.380> 200<00:02:24.800> bucks<00:02:24.920> is<00:02:25.220> an

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
point at about 200 bucks is an

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.770 
point at about 200 bucks is an
investment<00:02:25.880> but<00:02:26.180> you're<00:02:26.300> talking<00:02:26.570> about
