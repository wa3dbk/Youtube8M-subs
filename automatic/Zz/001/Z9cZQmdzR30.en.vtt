00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.510
 we put out of the sink to avoid 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.850
 some accident is very important to the 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.880

 deep down I have many potatoes that 

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:02.419
 I need them to combine 

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:04.159
 and while we do this we go in a 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:06.169
 commercial cut and later I'm going to 

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:10.249

 spectacular and means that I combine 

00:07:21.499 --> 00:07:26.179
 I was a cut and now we come back to 

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:28.450
