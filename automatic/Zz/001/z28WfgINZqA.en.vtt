00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:17.180
 when I assumed all this I did not know 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:21.050
 that I was able to face so many 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.880
 obstacles where I stayed without him and he 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.579
 came to pass away 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.869
 I learned to be rather an overweight woman. 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:32.260
 and more courageous fiber I also 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.000
 I did not want to leave to go down the drain 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.620
 all work all the effort he 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.820
 had conquered right? 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.360
 the assets he had conquered 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.910
 then I had in me that I would work 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.980
 at least to keep everything I had 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.930
 then left in 2007 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.670
 we open says general of alencar 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.430
 transport in your honor 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.180
 we ensured all vehicles was one year 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.430
 difficult because everything was solved and 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.860
 there is one thing every author has the 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.630
 Our father died. 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.079
 passed away passed away and now I have resolved 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:09.200
 You can speak with me but I realized in 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:11.330
 speaks clearly that he admired 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.610
 a woman is facing a branch is 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.300
 masculine as a transport branch of the 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.990
 equipment 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:22.000
 if it was not for this job I'm 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:27.470
 maybe I was a good person. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.870
 different in my daughter who is it okay 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.240
 with all the guts says mother do not need to 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.909
 We're looking to double the fleet but 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.890
 let's at least be renewed right 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.940
 to keep track of what's best in 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.490
 Marketplace 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:44.360
 My father had always bought 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.780
 scania trucks in since the 113 and was 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.570
 search in sÃ£o paulo de 1Âº 103 here 95 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.119
 blue lindÃ£o and then he always kept 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.490
 on the scan line and even when he died 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.170
 itself by not having added more 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.810
 new plans 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.640
 the company but we always renew with 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.490
 families are going to be 12 but only 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.530
 I even did it already. 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.189
 two years that I was contemplated in this 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.340
 console 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:11.860
 another reason is the service, the people 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.350
 has a lot of access to the concessionaire 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.620
 scania especially here in fortress 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.380
 countryman 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.370
 the lowest maintenance cost 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:24.870
 of the vehicle and the ease of finding 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.870
 parts in the market in general 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.340
 my father 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.950
 When he died, he already had a truck 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.020
 almost 30 years ago and I want to 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.050
 Gerard firmly maintain alencar 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.800
 transport for another generation 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.800
 thereafter
