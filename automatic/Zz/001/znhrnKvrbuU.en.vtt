550<00:00:05.759> that<00:00:05.970> I'm<00:00:06.089> really<00:00:06.690> building<00:00:07.140> so<00:00:08.059> Jets<00:00:09.059> of

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
550 that I'm really building so Jets of

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.270 
550 that I'm really building so Jets of
course<00:00:09.599> are<00:00:09.870> in<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.290> carburetor<00:00:10.620> you<00:00:10.920> got<00:00:11.190> the

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
course are in the carburetor you got the

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.970 
course are in the carburetor you got the
main<00:00:11.490> jet<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.120> pilot<00:00:12.540> jet<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.019> pilot<00:00:13.410> is

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
main jet and the pilot jet the pilot is

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.060 
main jet and the pilot jet the pilot is
also<00:00:14.490> known<00:00:14.730> as<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:14.910> slow<00:00:15.179> jet<00:00:15.450> but<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.710> main

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
also known as a slow jet but the main

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.550 
also known as a slow jet but the main
jet<00:00:17.369> basically<00:00:17.880> controlled<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.810> fuel<00:00:19.350> and

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
jet basically controlled the fuel and

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.740 
jet basically controlled the fuel and
air<00:00:19.770> going<00:00:20.070> into<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.760> motorcycle<00:00:21.480> at

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
air going into the motorcycle at

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.040 
air going into the motorcycle at
throttle<00:00:22.470> position<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:23.369> about<00:00:23.820> quarter<00:00:24.750> to

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
throttle position of about quarter to

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.429 
throttle position of about quarter to
full<00:00:25.350> throttle<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.789> pilot<00:00:27.570> or<00:00:27.750> also

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
full throttle and the pilot or also

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.220 
full throttle and the pilot or also
known<00:00:28.619> as<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.039> idle<00:00:29.730> jet<00:00:29.760> basically<00:00:30.570> controls

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
known as the idle jet basically controls

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.709 
known as the idle jet basically controls
the<00:00:31.500> field<00:00:32.189> going<00:00:32.579> into<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.880> engine<00:00:33.000> at<00:00:33.450> idle

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
the field going into the engine at idle

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.510 
the field going into the engine at idle
speeds<00:00:34.680> obviously<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.710> reasons<00:00:37.710> why<00:00:37.890> you

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
speeds obviously and reasons why you

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.549 
speeds obviously and reasons why you
need<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.790> replace<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.390> Jets<00:00:39.719> in<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.079> vehicle

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
need to replace the Jets in the vehicle

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.540 
need to replace the Jets in the vehicle
or<00:00:41.040> in<00:00:41.579> your<00:00:41.790> CB<00:00:42.149> 550<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.079> because<00:00:43.739> if<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.309> make

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
or in your CB 550 is because if you make

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.910 
or in your CB 550 is because if you make
any<00:00:44.789> kind<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.120> exhaust<00:00:45.629> modifications<00:00:46.500> or<00:00:46.770> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
any kind of exhaust modifications or the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.250 
any kind of exhaust modifications or the
intake<00:00:47.309> modifications<00:00:48.210> it's<00:00:48.840> going<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.140> mess

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
intake modifications it's going to mess

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.369 
intake modifications it's going to mess
up<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.469> air<00:00:49.710> fuel<00:00:49.920> ratio<00:00:50.180> going<00:00:51.180> into<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
up the air fuel ratio going into the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.150 
up the air fuel ratio going into the
motorcycle<00:00:53.190> engine<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:54.860> depending<00:00:55.860> on<00:00:56.039> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
motorcycle engine so depending on the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.209 
motorcycle engine so depending on the
exhaust<00:00:56.399> setup<00:00:56.670> it's<00:00:57.059> going<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.329> change<00:00:57.840> the

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
exhaust setup it's going to change the

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.760 
exhaust setup it's going to change the
exhaust<00:00:59.219> air<00:00:59.460> back<00:00:59.789> pressure<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.770> depending

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
exhaust air back pressure and depending

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.529 
exhaust air back pressure and depending
on<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.949> intake<00:01:02.280> setup<00:01:02.640> you're<00:01:02.969> going<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.359> have

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
on the intake setup you're going to have

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.200 
on the intake setup you're going to have
more<00:01:03.989> flow<00:01:04.320> let's<00:01:04.650> fro<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.250> that's<00:01:06.000> going<00:01:06.150> to

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
more flow let's fro and that's going to

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.289 
more flow let's fro and that's going to
mess<00:01:06.390> up<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:07.130> how<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.189> fuel<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.850> burning

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
mess up the how the fuel is burning

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.420 
mess up the how the fuel is burning
inside<00:01:09.900> engine<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.890> very<00:01:11.100> critical

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
inside engine so it is very critical

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.250 
inside engine so it is very critical
that<00:01:11.729> you're<00:01:12.150> making<00:01:12.330> any<00:01:12.630> kind<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.930> changes

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
that you're making any kind of changes

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.649 
that you're making any kind of changes
to<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.530> exhaust<00:01:13.830> or<00:01:14.040> intake<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.150> reject

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
to the exhaust or intake that you reject

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.800 
to the exhaust or intake that you reject
your<00:01:15.840> motorcycle<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:17.570> first<00:01:18.570> things<00:01:18.750> first

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
your motorcycle so first things first

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.030 
your motorcycle so first things first
here<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.280> cooperator<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.960> CB<00:01:22.380> 550

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
here is the cooperator of the CB 550

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.510 
here is the cooperator of the CB 550
when<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.759> take<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.090> off<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.420> looks<00:01:24.750> like<00:01:25.080> this

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
when you take it off it looks like this

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.850 
when you take it off it looks like this
with<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.549> little<00:01:27.210> cover<00:01:27.390> on<00:01:27.509> top<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:28.560> cover

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
with the little cover on top this cover

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.490 
with the little cover on top this cover
is<00:01:29.159> held<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:29.820> by<00:01:30.090> four<00:01:30.390> bolts<00:01:30.689> one<00:01:30.900> two<00:01:31.170> three

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
is held on by four bolts one two three

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.590 
is held on by four bolts one two three
four<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.770> just<00:01:32.100> remove<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.490> with<00:01:33.150> Philips

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
four you just remove that with Philips

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.929 
four you just remove that with Philips
and<00:01:34.290> inside<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.520> will<00:01:35.549> see<00:01:35.790> something<00:01:36.780> like

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
and inside you will see something like

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.289 
and inside you will see something like
this<00:01:39.770> in<00:01:40.770> one<00:01:40.920> second<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.640> already<00:01:42.119> took

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
this in one second I already took

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.060 
this in one second I already took
everything<00:01:42.600> apart<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.229> I'm<00:01:43.500> just<00:01:43.649> pop<00:01:43.920> it

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
everything apart and I'm just pop it

00:01:44.070 --> 00:02:03.060 
everything apart and I'm just pop it
back<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.430> here

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.919 

yeah<00:02:04.070> it's<00:02:04.369> it's<00:02:04.969> not<00:02:05.179> exactly<00:02:05.539> how<00:02:05.689> it<00:02:05.719> came

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
yeah it's it's not exactly how it came

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.160 
yeah it's it's not exactly how it came
out<00:02:06.170> but<00:02:06.350> basically<00:02:06.530> you<00:02:07.039> get<00:02:07.189> the<00:02:07.280> idea

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
out but basically you get the idea

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.890 
out but basically you get the idea
there's<00:02:09.170> a<00:02:09.259> little<00:02:09.500> clip<00:02:09.709> up<00:02:09.920> top<00:02:10.160> and<00:02:10.900> you

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
there's a little clip up top and you

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.170 
there's a little clip up top and you
basically<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:12.800> move<00:02:12.980> that<00:02:13.129> clip<00:02:13.400> and<00:02:13.550> inside

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
basically you move that clip and inside

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.830 
basically you move that clip and inside
here<00:02:14.540> is<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:15.110> main<00:02:15.440> jet<00:02:15.890> this<00:02:16.190> is<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.940> jet

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
here is the main jet this is the jet

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.720 
here is the main jet this is the jet
that<00:02:17.989> console<00:02:18.410> controls<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.069> fuel<00:02:19.280> going<00:02:19.489> to

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
that console controls the fuel going to

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.270 
that console controls the fuel going to
the<00:02:19.819> engine<00:02:20.150> a<00:02:20.269> wide-open<00:02:20.690> throttle<00:02:21.319> so

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
the engine a wide-open throttle so

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.250 
the engine a wide-open throttle so
that's<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:23.000> one<00:02:23.180> jet<00:02:23.510> that<00:02:23.840> you<00:02:24.019> need<00:02:24.170> to

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
that's the one jet that you need to

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.759 
that's the one jet that you need to
replace<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:25.090> slow<00:02:26.090> jet<00:02:26.390> or<00:02:26.569> pilot<00:02:27.319> jet<00:02:27.590> is

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
replace and slow jet or pilot jet is

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.610 
replace and slow jet or pilot jet is
this<00:02:28.129> jet<00:02:28.459> on<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.760> right<00:02:28.940> side<00:02:29.150> here<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:29.629> it

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
this jet on the right side here and it

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.390 
this jet on the right side here and it
is<00:02:30.739> simply<00:02:31.160> screwed<00:02:31.670> in<00:02:31.940> so<00:02:32.180> you<00:02:32.239> just<00:02:32.450> grab<00:02:32.690> a

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
is simply screwed in so you just grab a

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.240 
is simply screwed in so you just grab a
screwdriver<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:35.000> unscrew<00:02:35.150> this<00:02:35.660> guy<00:02:36.250> so

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
screwdriver and unscrew this guy so

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.009 
screwdriver and unscrew this guy so
those<00:02:37.489> are<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:37.700> two<00:02:37.880> jets<00:02:38.180> that<00:02:38.569> needs<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:38.900> be

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
those are the two jets that needs to be

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.069 
those are the two jets that needs to be
replaced<00:02:39.380> and<00:02:39.970> I<00:02:40.970> did<00:02:41.299> a<00:02:41.329> lot<00:02:41.599> of<00:02:41.630> research

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
replaced and I did a lot of research

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.170 
replaced and I did a lot of research
online<00:02:42.290> trying<00:02:43.069> to<00:02:43.160> figure<00:02:43.340> out<00:02:43.489> what<00:02:43.880> size

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
I have 420 sauce here so basically it's

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.420 
I have 420 sauce here so basically it's
telling<00:03:22.700> me<00:03:22.730> to<00:03:22.850> increase<00:03:23.299> two<00:03:23.630> jet<00:03:23.900> sizes<00:03:24.430> 441

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
telling me to increase two jet sizes 441

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.879 
telling me to increase two jet sizes 441
exhaust<00:03:25.850> and<00:03:26.540> it's<00:03:26.690> also<00:03:26.900> telling<00:03:27.290> me<00:03:27.440> to

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
exhaust and it's also telling me to

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:29.920 
exhaust and it's also telling me to
increase<00:03:28.220> two<00:03:28.549> jet<00:03:28.760> sizes<00:03:28.970> for<00:03:29.299> individual

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
increase two jet sizes for individual

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.610 
increase two jet sizes for individual
filters<00:03:30.609> by<00:03:31.609> individual<00:03:32.150> filters<00:03:32.599> what<00:03:33.470> it

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
filters by individual filters what it

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.440 
filters by individual filters what it
means<00:03:33.829> is<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:34.220> part<00:03:34.519> filters<00:03:35.000> that<00:03:35.239> I'm<00:03:35.299> going

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
means is the part filters that I'm going

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.210 
means is the part filters that I'm going
to<00:03:35.510> be<00:03:35.569> installing<00:03:35.959> here<00:03:36.260> it's<00:03:36.590> just<00:03:36.950> the

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
to be installing here it's just the

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.759 
to be installing here it's just the
cone-shaped<00:03:38.180> filters<00:03:38.599> that<00:03:38.870> basically<00:03:39.290> sits

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
cone-shaped filters that basically sits

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:45.370 
cone-shaped filters that basically sits
on<00:03:40.480> individual<00:03:41.680> inlet<00:03:43.090> so<00:03:44.090> I<00:03:44.359> got<00:03:44.810> three<00:03:45.170> four

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
on individual inlet so I got three four

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.430 
on individual inlet so I got three four
four<00:03:45.650> two<00:03:45.829> one<00:03:45.859> and<00:03:46.280> two<00:03:46.700> four<00:03:47.440> individual

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
four two one and two four individual

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.470 
four two one and two four individual
part<00:03:48.799> filters<00:03:49.310> what<00:03:49.849> you<00:03:49.970> want<00:03:50.120> to<00:03:50.180> do<00:03:50.269> let's

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
part filters what you want to do let's

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.229 
part filters what you want to do let's
add<00:03:50.630> these<00:03:50.959> two<00:03:51.290> up<00:03:51.440> and<00:03:51.590> subtract<00:03:52.370> one<00:03:52.639> and<00:03:52.819> I

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
add these two up and subtract one and I

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.720 
add these two up and subtract one and I
guess<00:03:53.450> three<00:03:53.780> so<00:03:54.380> and<00:03:54.829> it<00:03:54.919> increased<00:03:55.459> three

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
guess three so and it increased three

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.809 
guess three so and it increased three
sizes<00:03:56.030> for<00:03:56.269> the<00:03:56.599> main<00:03:56.780> jet<00:03:57.109> as<00:03:57.859> far<00:03:58.220> as<00:03:58.430> the

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
sizes for the main jet as far as the

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:00.940 
sizes for the main jet as far as the
pilot<00:03:59.180> jet<00:03:59.359> goes<00:03:59.599> it<00:03:59.870> tells<00:04:00.139> you<00:04:00.349> that<00:04:00.410> one

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
pilot jet goes it tells you that one

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.069 
pilot jet goes it tells you that one
pilot<00:04:01.340> jet<00:04:01.549> size<00:04:01.760> increase<00:04:02.209> for<00:04:02.480> every<00:04:02.780> three

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
pilot jet size increase for every three

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:05.589 
pilot jet size increase for every three
main<00:04:03.410> jet<00:04:03.739> size<00:04:03.980> increase<00:04:04.459> so<00:04:05.090> I<00:04:05.120> need<00:04:05.510> to

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
main jet size increase so I need to

main jet size increase so I need to
increase<00:04:05.930> my<00:04:05.989> pilot<00:04:06.950> jet<00:04:07.160> sides<00:04:07.400> by<00:04:07.700> one<00:04:07.940> main

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
increase my pilot jet sides by one main

so<00:04:32.600> the<00:04:32.870> stock<00:04:33.199> jet<00:04:34.070> size<00:04:34.310> so<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:34.699> CB<00:04:34.970> 550<00:04:35.479> for

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
so the stock jet size so the CB 550 for

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.629 
so the stock jet size so the CB 550 for
the<00:04:35.870> pilot<00:04:36.320> side<00:04:36.500> is<00:04:36.770> 38

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
the pilot side is 38

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:43.749 
the pilot side is 38
so<00:04:38.210> as<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:39.490> Danny<00:04:40.490> told<00:04:41.270> me<00:04:41.419> online<00:04:42.289> I<00:04:42.889> need<00:04:43.639> to

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 
so as the Danny told me online I need to

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.490 
so as the Danny told me online I need to
increase<00:04:44.030> one<00:04:44.270> side<00:04:44.509> so<00:04:44.810> I'm<00:04:44.930> going<00:04:45.199> to<00:04:45.229> go

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
increase one side so I'm going to go

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.260 
increase one side so I'm going to go
with<00:04:45.919> the<00:04:46.070> size<00:04:46.280> 40

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.270 

40<00:04:51.020> and<00:04:51.340> on<00:04:52.340> the<00:04:52.490> main<00:04:52.700> jet<00:04:53.170> CB<00:04:54.170> 550<00:04:54.710> is<00:04:54.830> stuck

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
40 and on the main jet CB 550 is stuck

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.270 
40 and on the main jet CB 550 is stuck
just<00:04:55.790> as<00:04:56.030> 100<00:04:56.840> so<00:04:56.990> I'm<00:04:57.050> going<00:04:57.260> to<00:04:57.530> increase<00:04:57.980> by

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
just as 100 so I'm going to increase by

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.930 
just as 100 so I'm going to increase by
suicide<00:04:58.580> this<00:04:58.970> and<00:04:59.180> go<00:04:59.300> with<00:04:59.540> 115<00:05:00.430> and<00:05:01.430> I'm

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
suicide this and go with 115 and I'm

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.900 
suicide this and go with 115 and I'm
going<00:05:02.120> to<00:05:02.150> add<00:05:02.300> that<00:05:02.450> the<00:05:02.630> card<00:05:02.900> and<00:05:03.850> I<00:05:04.850> have

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
going to add that the card and I have

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.270 
going to add that the card and I have
150<00:05:05.240> and<00:05:05.810> 40<00:05:06.530> and<00:05:07.450> the<00:05:08.450> reason<00:05:08.930> why<00:05:09.080> I<00:05:09.110> have<00:05:09.560> 115

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
150 and 40 and the reason why I have 115

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.740 
150 and 40 and the reason why I have 115
in<00:05:10.490> here<00:05:10.700> as<00:05:10.880> well<00:05:11.300> as<00:05:11.600> the<00:05:12.370> 120<00:05:13.370> is<00:05:13.750> because

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
in here as well as the 120 is because

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.530 
in here as well as the 120 is because
even<00:05:15.320> though<00:05:15.710> this<00:05:15.950> guide<00:05:16.250> is<00:05:16.580> pretty

even though this guide is pretty

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
accurate it is not going to get the jet

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.270 
accurate it is not going to get the jet
size<00:05:21.200> 100%<00:05:22.160> accurate<00:05:22.880> for<00:05:23.180> your<00:05:23.480> motorcycle

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
size 100% accurate for your motorcycle

size 100% accurate for your motorcycle
every<00:05:25.280> motorcycle<00:05:25.910> is<00:05:25.970> a<00:05:26.030> little<00:05:26.270> different

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
every motorcycle is a little different

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.660 
every motorcycle is a little different
every<00:05:27.410> exhaust<00:05:28.010> is<00:05:28.160> going<00:05:28.310> to<00:05:28.370> be<00:05:28.460> a<00:05:28.490> little

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:28.670 
every exhaust is going to be a little

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.150 
every exhaust is going to be a little
different<00:05:28.910> depending<00:05:29.300> on<00:05:30.200> your<00:05:30.350> altitude<00:05:30.770> or

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
different depending on your altitude or

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.200 
different depending on your altitude or
where<00:05:31.340> you<00:05:31.490> live<00:05:31.760> of<00:05:32.390> course<00:05:32.720> it's<00:05:32.930> gonna<00:05:34.210> the

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
where you live of course it's gonna the

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.580 
where you live of course it's gonna the
system<00:05:35.600> is<00:05:35.690> going<00:05:35.780> to<00:05:35.870> be<00:05:35.930> pressurized<00:05:36.470> a

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
system is going to be pressurized a

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.900 
system is going to be pressurized a
little<00:05:36.770> differently<00:05:37.160> so<00:05:37.250> it's<00:05:37.520> going<00:05:37.610> to<00:05:37.670> pull

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:37.910 
little differently so it's going to pull

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.570 
little differently so it's going to pull
different<00:05:38.540> amount<00:05:39.170> of<00:05:39.320> fuel<00:05:40.160> into<00:05:40.430> the

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
different amount of fuel into the

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.320 
different amount of fuel into the
motorcycle<00:05:41.540> so<00:05:42.130> it<00:05:43.130> is<00:05:43.310> recommended<00:05:44.000> that<00:05:44.030> you

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
motorcycle so it is recommended that you

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.800 
motorcycle so it is recommended that you
buy<00:05:44.570> a<00:05:45.080> bunch<00:05:45.320> of<00:05:45.820> different<00:05:46.820> size<00:05:47.030> jets<00:05:47.450> so

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
buy a bunch of different size jets so

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.170 
buy a bunch of different size jets so
that<00:05:48.020> you<00:05:48.140> can<00:05:48.290> play<00:05:48.560> around<00:05:48.760> swap<00:05:49.760> them<00:05:49.970> in

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
that you can play around swap them in

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.450 
that you can play around swap them in
and<00:05:50.360> out<00:05:50.480> and<00:05:50.750> check<00:05:51.320> the<00:05:51.350> spark<00:05:51.680> plugs<00:05:51.980> after

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
and out and check the spark plugs after

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.790 
and out and check the spark plugs after
you<00:05:52.910> ride<00:05:53.150> the<00:05:53.300> bike<00:05:53.450> each<00:05:53.720> time<00:05:54.020> to<00:05:54.590> make<00:05:54.620> sure

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
you ride the bike each time to make sure

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.400 
you ride the bike each time to make sure
that<00:05:55.370> the<00:05:55.730> jet<00:05:56.120> size<00:05:56.390> that<00:05:56.930> you<00:05:57.020> have<00:05:57.170> on<00:05:57.320> the

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
that the jet size that you have on the

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.370 
that the jet size that you have on the
bike<00:05:57.560> is<00:05:57.830> in<00:05:58.700> fact<00:05:59.030> what<00:05:59.600> you're<00:05:59.780> looking<00:06:00.170> for

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
bike is in fact what you're looking for

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.730 
bike is in fact what you're looking for
so<00:06:01.390> I'm<00:06:02.390> gonna<00:06:02.570> order<00:06:02.750> these<00:06:02.960> up<00:06:03.200> online<00:06:03.530> from

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
so I'm gonna order these up online from

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.000 
so I'm gonna order these up online from
jet<00:06:03.920> as<00:06:04.370> calm<00:06:05.000> and<00:06:05.300> once<00:06:06.170> I<00:06:06.290> receive<00:06:06.680> it<00:06:06.860> I'm

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
jet as calm and once I receive it I'm

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.340 
jet as calm and once I receive it I'm
gonna<00:06:07.610> be<00:06:07.820> installing<00:06:08.450> the<00:06:08.810> Jets<00:06:09.020> in<00:06:09.170> the

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350 
gonna be installing the Jets in the

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.620 
gonna be installing the Jets in the
carburetor<00:06:09.770> which<00:06:10.520> is<00:06:10.670> super<00:06:11.000> simple<00:06:11.390> it<00:06:11.600> just

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.630 
carburetor which is super simple it just

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.850 
carburetor which is super simple it just
just<00:06:12.140> screws<00:06:12.440> into<00:06:12.650> the<00:06:12.770> bike<00:06:13.010> and<00:06:14.860> hopefully

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
just screws into the bike and hopefully

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.440 
just screws into the bike and hopefully
I'll<00:06:16.070> be<00:06:16.220> putting<00:06:16.520> the<00:06:16.670> carburetor<00:06:17.030> back<00:06:17.240> on<00:06:17.420> a

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:17.450 
I'll be putting the carburetor back on a

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.700 
I'll be putting the carburetor back on a
bike<00:06:17.660> soon<00:06:18.140> so<00:06:18.920> that's<00:06:19.910> it<00:06:20.330> for<00:06:20.750> the<00:06:21.020> corpse<00:06:21.500> I

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710 
bike soon so that's it for the corpse I

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.190 
bike soon so that's it for the corpse I
know<00:06:21.920> there<00:06:22.430> was<00:06:22.490> a<00:06:22.550> lot<00:06:22.760> of<00:06:22.790> information<00:06:23.180> as<00:06:24.140> a

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:24.200 
know there was a lot of information as a

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.330 
know there was a lot of information as a
first-time<00:06:24.910> builder<00:06:25.910> or<00:06:26.150> first-time

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340

rejecting<00:06:28.340> a<00:06:28.400> carburetor<00:06:28.820> there<00:06:29.060> was<00:06:29.150> a<00:06:29.180> lot

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:29.390 
rejecting a carburetor there was a lot

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.360 
rejecting a carburetor there was a lot
of<00:06:29.540> research<00:06:29.900> that<00:06:29.930> I<00:06:30.200> had<00:06:30.350> to<00:06:30.380> do<00:06:30.620> online<00:06:30.800> and

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 
of research that I had to do online and
