00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
what your building required so let's

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.520 
what your building required so let's
just<00:00:42.270> say<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.690> have<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.930> living<00:00:43.379> room

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
just say that you have a living room

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.270 
just say that you have a living room
that's<00:00:44.010> 30<00:00:44.370> foot<00:00:44.700> long<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.590> it's<00:00:46.590> 30<00:00:46.980> foot

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
that's 30 foot long and it's 30 foot

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.500 
that's 30 foot long and it's 30 foot
wide<00:00:47.550> it's<00:00:47.969> going<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.510> require<00:00:49.190> a<00:00:50.510> heavier

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
wide it's going to require a heavier

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.799 
wide it's going to require a heavier
duty<00:00:52.129> floor<00:00:53.660> than<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:55.129> than<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.430> room<00:00:56.789> that's<00:00:57.059> 15

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
duty floor than a than a room that's 15

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.439

foot<00:00:58.109> by<00:00:58.289> 15<00:00:58.770> foot<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.699> you're<00:00:59.879> going<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.239> need

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
foot by 15 foot so you're going to need

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.080 
foot by 15 foot so you're going to need
thicker<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.050> stronger<00:01:01.770> floor<00:01:02.340> joist<00:01:02.730> and

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
thicker and stronger floor joist and

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.810 
thicker and stronger floor joist and
you're<00:01:03.989> going<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.530> need<00:01:04.769> structural<00:01:05.549> beams

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
you're going to need structural beams

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.260 
you're going to need structural beams
and<00:01:06.090> posts<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:07.409> hold<00:01:07.920> up<00:01:08.100> larger<00:01:08.670> items<00:01:09.119> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
and posts to hold up larger items the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.830 
and posts to hold up larger items the
structural<00:01:09.780> engineer<00:01:10.260> provides<00:01:11.210> you<00:01:12.210> with

structural engineer provides you with

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.260 
structural engineer provides you with
that<00:01:13.110> information<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.400> architect<00:01:15.000> draws

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
that information so the architect draws

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.929 
that information so the architect draws
the<00:01:15.479> plans<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.140> then<00:01:17.100> when<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.430> plans<00:01:17.700> are

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
the plans and then when the plans are

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.450 
the plans and then when the plans are
done<00:01:18.150> gives<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.990> plans<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.950> structural

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
done gives the plans to the structural

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.800 
done gives the plans to the structural

engineer structural engineer designs the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.690 
engineer structural engineer designs the
house<00:01:25.790> and<00:01:26.790> then<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.509> provides<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.700> architect

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
house and then it provides the architect

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.929 
house and then it provides the architect
with<00:01:29.909> all<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.299> information<00:01:30.630> on<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:32.400> sizes<00:01:32.909> of

concrete footings the foundation is the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.580 
concrete footings the foundation is the
structural<00:01:38.070> engineers<00:01:38.549> responsibility<00:01:39.590> he

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
structural engineers responsibility he

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.440 
structural engineers responsibility he
sends<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:40.950> back<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.579> architect<00:01:42.150> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
sends that back to the architect the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.210 
sends that back to the architect the
architect<00:01:42.960> goes<00:01:43.110> over<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.619> make<00:01:43.770> sure<00:01:43.799> that

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
architect goes over to make sure that

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.050 
architect goes over to make sure that
none<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.430> these<00:01:46.220> none<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.399> like<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.820> floor

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
none of these none of the like the floor

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.999 
none of these none of the like the floor
beams<00:01:48.360> or<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.840> floor<00:01:49.049> joists<00:01:49.380> are<00:01:49.649> going<00:01:49.920> to

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
beams or the floor joists are going to

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.639 
beams or the floor joists are going to
affect<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.520> building<00:01:50.939> in<00:01:51.119> any<00:01:51.329> way<00:01:51.649> so

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
affect the building in any way so

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.710 
affect the building in any way so
sometimes<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.670> engineer<00:01:54.210> might<00:01:54.420> draw<00:01:54.689> a

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
sometimes the engineer might draw a

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.039 
sometimes the engineer might draw a
structural<00:01:55.380> beam<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:56.090> but<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.270> beam<00:01:57.600> is

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
structural beam in but the beam is

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.410 
structural beam in but the beam is
thicker<00:01:58.350> than<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:59.399> floor<00:01:59.640> joist<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.329> would

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
thicker than the floor joist so it would

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.389 
thicker than the floor joist so it would
actually<00:02:00.450> be<00:02:00.960> sticking<00:02:01.409> into<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.890> ceiling

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
actually be sticking into the ceiling

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.859 
actually be sticking into the ceiling
because<00:02:02.640> it's<00:02:02.850> not<00:02:03.000> going<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.210> be<00:02:03.329> sticking<00:02:03.719> up

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
because it's not going to be sticking up

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.080 
because it's not going to be sticking up
into<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.290> floor<00:02:04.590> let's<00:02:05.520> say<00:02:05.729> it's<00:02:05.850> sticking

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
into the floor let's say it's sticking

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.270 
into the floor let's say it's sticking
down<00:02:06.630> into<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.200> ceiling<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.710> architect

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
down into the ceiling the architect

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.249 
down into the ceiling the architect
might<00:02:08.489> not<00:02:08.700> like<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:08.940> he<00:02:09.330> sends<00:02:09.660> back<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:10.050> the

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
might not like that he sends back to the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.479 
might not like that he sends back to the
structural<00:02:10.860> engineer

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
structural engineer

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.789 
structural engineer
and<00:02:11.579> in<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.359> structural<00:02:12.750> engineer<00:02:13.230> redesigns

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
and in the structural engineer redesigns

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.830 
and in the structural engineer redesigns
it<00:02:14.010> from<00:02:14.219> there<00:02:14.459> so<00:02:15.299> the<00:02:15.420> structural

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
it from there so the structural

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.530 
it from there so the structural
engineers<00:02:16.409> job<00:02:16.799> is<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.219> provide<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:18.120> home

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540
