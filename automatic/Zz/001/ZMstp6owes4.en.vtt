dance a lot of guys I think don't join
because<00:04:14.129> they<00:04:14.459> think<00:04:14.579> they<00:04:14.730> have<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:14.879> be

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
because they think they have to be

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.060 
because they think they have to be
extremely<00:04:15.269> good<00:04:15.689> dancers<00:04:16.139> and<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.560> emotion

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
extremely good dancers and the emotion

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.589 
extremely good dancers and the emotion
and<00:04:17.220> while<00:04:17.549> we<00:04:17.669> have<00:04:17.789> people<00:04:17.940> who<00:04:18.180> are<00:04:18.209> that

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
and while we have people who are that

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.199 
and while we have people who are that
the<00:04:19.349> reason<00:04:19.709> that<00:04:19.739> motion<00:04:20.639> is<00:04:20.729> there<00:04:20.880> is<00:04:21.030> not

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
the reason that motion is there is not

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.719 
the reason that motion is there is not
so<00:04:21.509> people<00:04:21.959> perform<00:04:22.409> or<00:04:22.770> people<00:04:23.340> say<00:04:23.520> while

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
so people perform or people say while

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.279 
so people perform or people say while
they're<00:04:23.940> very<00:04:24.120> dancers<00:04:24.539> it's<00:04:24.720> so<00:04:24.990> we<00:04:25.110> can

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
they're very dancers it's so we can

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:26.870 
they're very dancers it's so we can
share<00:04:25.500> Christ<00:04:25.830> with<00:04:25.979> other<00:04:26.250> people<00:04:26.610> and<00:04:26.789> I

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
share Christ with other people and I

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.879 
share Christ with other people and I
think<00:04:26.909> that's<00:04:27.720> the<00:04:27.810> real<00:04:28.020> reason<00:04:28.050> why<00:04:28.590> I

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
think that's the real reason why I

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.279 
think that's the real reason why I
joined<00:04:29.159> a<00:04:29.699> simple<00:04:30.330> out<00:04:30.539> there<00:04:30.750> usually<00:04:30.900> think

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289
