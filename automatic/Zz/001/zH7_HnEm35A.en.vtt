00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.400
 Hello everyone, I'll tell you what to try 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.130
 new weapon with add-on naval strike 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.740
 it is already possible for this you need to find not 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.420
 rank server on which everything is open 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.849
 so that you do not bother to search 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.250
 link to a similar server will be in 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.020
 description under this video but for now 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.199
 let's go over the most interesting 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.410
 nuance of the new weapon machine gun a in with and 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.050
 assault rifle and p 160 in terms of damage 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.599
 nothing special stands on duty 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.730
 damage model in each case and weight 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.530
 by the way the store for 100 rounds which 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.570
 recharges relatively quickly 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.180
 more interest is on 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.690
 automatic sniper rifle with or 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.390
 338 store for 10 rounds + 1 in 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.899
 chambered firing rate 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.940
 equals 150 shots per minute if 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.920
 shoot the maximum pace we get 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.020
 wild scatter so after each 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.289
 shots need to do a little 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.329
 pause to stabilize the accuracy of the model 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.070
 damage similar to that of his or oud 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.439
 rifles on long and medium 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.689
 distances for the frag need all those 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.270
 same three body hits or two 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.340
 headshots even on extremely close ones 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.430
 distances still have to get into 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.130
 head for guaranteed frag what 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.920
 touches the self defense weapon sp2 point blank 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.680
 enemy take 26 damage minimum damage 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.840
 is 11 points rate of fire 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.119
 high while the word is controlled 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.040
 simply reload speed 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.740
 no complaints 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.750
 standard for category pdv well and 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.030
 dessert we have anti-aircraft mines 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.180
 work on the principle of aiming at targets 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.890
 angle of capture and distance of operation 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.049
 limited as you already understood to put 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.810
 they need the intended direction 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.670
 the departure of enemy air vehicles to 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.399
 you can set two words at the same time 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.009
 mines against this gadget are great 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.680
 work ik traps rap doesn't work 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.899
 always go to the server in general 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.600
 try it yourself and write your impressions
