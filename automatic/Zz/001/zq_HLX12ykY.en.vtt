what he's done in Akron his ability as a

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.480 
what he's done in Akron his ability as a

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
lone striker Luis Silva's I think had a

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.979 
lone striker Luis Silva's I think had a
very<00:04:15.760> good<00:04:15.820> week<00:04:16.120> and<00:04:16.420> when<00:04:16.600> you've<00:04:16.720> watched

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
very good week and when you've watched

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.270 
very good week and when you've watched
him<00:04:17.230> play<00:04:17.350> through<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.680> year<00:04:17.859> he<00:04:18.010> can<00:04:18.160> play

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
him play through the year he can play

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.070 
him play through the year he can play
anywhere<00:04:18.370> in<00:04:18.820> the<00:04:18.910> midfield<00:04:19.090> he's<00:04:19.870> got

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
anywhere in the midfield he's got

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.900 
anywhere in the midfield he's got
mobility<00:04:20.650> he's<00:04:20.859> got<00:04:21.070> soccer<00:04:21.370> since<00:04:21.700> he's

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
mobility he's got soccer since he's

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.660 
mobility he's got soccer since he's
clever<00:04:22.300> I<00:04:22.900> think<00:04:23.710> he'll<00:04:23.950> be<00:04:24.160> a<00:04:24.190> successful

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670

further<00:05:08.469> down<00:05:08.740> the<00:05:08.889> draft<00:05:09.129> board<00:05:09.309> but<00:05:10.059> that

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
further down the draft board but that

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.089 
further down the draft board but that
didn't<00:05:10.569> mean<00:05:10.719> that<00:05:10.899> Burmese<00:05:11.319> was<00:05:11.649> giving<00:05:12.009> up

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:12.099

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:15.459 
his roster there's some thought that

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:17.459 
his roster there's some thought that
maybe<00:05:15.939> we<00:05:16.179> try<00:05:16.300> to<00:05:16.419> trade<00:05:16.689> up<00:05:16.839> to<00:05:16.869> get<00:05:17.139> a<00:05:17.169> higher

00:05:17.459 --> 00:05:17.469 
maybe we try to trade up to get a higher

another<00:05:26.919> kid<00:05:27.219> that<00:05:27.459> I<00:05:27.490> think<00:05:27.789> not<00:05:28.330> only<00:05:28.389> his

00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:28.629 
another kid that I think not only his

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:31.139 
another kid that I think not only his
qualities<00:05:29.050> but<00:05:29.229> way<00:05:29.830> he<00:05:30.009> plays<00:05:30.279> actually

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:31.149 
qualities but way he plays actually

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:32.429 
qualities but way he plays actually
would<00:05:31.269> fit<00:05:31.449> into<00:05:31.569> our<00:05:31.719> system<00:05:32.110> we<00:05:32.229> think

00:05:32.429 --> 00:05:32.439 
would fit into our system we think

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:34.529 
would fit into our system we think
pretty<00:05:32.619> well<00:05:32.860> and<00:05:33.129> then<00:05:33.189> that<00:05:34.029> then<00:05:34.240> it's<00:05:34.419> the

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539 
pretty well and then that then it's the

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:36.689 
pretty well and then that then it's the

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:38.919 
to international players and trying to

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:40.169 
to international players and trying to

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
league and things like that but I

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.199 
league and things like that but I
believe<00:06:42.069> that<00:06:42.129> this<00:06:42.309> is<00:06:42.490> the<00:06:42.519> foundation<00:06:43.089> of

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:43.209 
believe that this is the foundation of

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:45.269 
believe that this is the foundation of
your<00:06:43.329> team<00:06:43.569> as<00:06:43.779> you<00:06:43.929> move<00:06:44.079> forward<00:06:44.229> if<00:06:44.889> you<00:06:45.069> can

00:06:45.269 --> 00:06:45.279 
your team as you move forward if you can

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:47.040 
your team as you move forward if you can
get<00:06:45.430> one<00:06:45.459> guy<00:06:45.879> out<00:06:46.059> of<00:06:46.089> the<00:06:46.209> draft<00:06:46.419> each<00:06:46.689> year

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.050 
get one guy out of the draft each year

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.929 
get one guy out of the draft each year
that<00:06:47.319> winds<00:06:47.680> up<00:06:47.740> making<00:06:48.039> a<00:06:48.099> serious<00:06:48.430> impact<00:06:48.729> on

00:06:48.929 --> 00:06:48.939 
that winds up making a serious impact on

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:49.399 
that winds up making a serious impact on
your<00:06:49.089> team

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:49.409 
your team

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:51.290 
your team
and<00:06:49.499> I<00:06:49.800> think<00:06:50.580> you've<00:06:50.699> done<00:06:50.819> a<00:06:50.849> very<00:06:50.909> good<00:06:51.119> job

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 
and I think you've done a very good job

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.299 
and I think you've done a very good job
if<00:06:51.689> you<00:06:51.779> can<00:06:51.929> wind<00:06:52.139> up<00:06:52.199> getting<00:06:52.499> to<00:06:52.679> three<00:06:53.099> then

00:06:53.299 --> 00:06:53.309 
if you can wind up getting to three then
