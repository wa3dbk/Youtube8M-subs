00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.490 
me someone else cool every tip I have
which<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.270> would<00:01:54.390> probably<00:01:54.750> agree<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:55.229> that

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
which you would probably agree is that

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.190 
which you would probably agree is that
presentation<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.670> another<00:01:56.970> thing<00:01:57.209> so<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.840> used

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
presentation is another thing so I used

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.199 
presentation is another thing so I used
clothing<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.069> buffalo<00:01:59.399> head<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.789> a<00:01:59.849> half<00:02:00.000> in

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:00.209 
clothing the buffalo head and a half in

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:02.749 
clothing the buffalo head and a half in
a<00:02:00.270> bag<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:01.170> just<00:02:01.349> kind<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.649> plop<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.579> on<00:02:02.640> the

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
a bag and just kind of plop it on the

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.819 
a bag and just kind of plop it on the
counter<00:02:03.090> but<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.539> decided<00:02:04.020> that's<00:02:04.319> probably<00:02:04.770> a

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
counter but I decided that's probably a

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.469 
counter but I decided that's probably a
better<00:02:04.920> thing<00:02:05.220> to<00:02:05.250> come<00:02:05.549> in<00:02:05.700> having<00:02:06.239> them<00:02:06.450> a

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
better thing to come in having them a

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.880 
better thing to come in having them a
little<00:02:06.750> bit<00:02:06.840> more<00:02:06.959> organized<00:02:07.409> all<00:02:07.709> these

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
little bit more organized all these

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.669 
little bit more organized all these
years<00:02:08.130> they<00:02:08.429> look<00:02:08.610> good<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:09.000> do<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:10.440> way<00:02:10.560> it's

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
years they look good to do that way it's

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.120 
years they look good to do that way it's
easier<00:02:10.950> for<00:02:10.979> them

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
easier for them

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.760

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
see each piece a little bit better and

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.130 
see each piece a little bit better and
