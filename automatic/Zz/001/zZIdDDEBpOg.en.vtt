that's<00:00:55.220> unboxing<00:00:56.220> it<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.550> we<00:00:57.180> have<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.330> paper

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.630 
that's unboxing it and we have a paper

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.260 
that's unboxing it and we have a paper
inside<00:01:00.800> you'll<00:01:01.800> see<00:01:01.860> this<00:01:02.160> these<00:01:02.520> are<00:01:02.790> inner

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
inside you'll see this these are inner

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.670 
inside you'll see this these are inner
layers<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.170> parts<00:01:06.079> lots<00:01:07.079> of<00:01:07.290> parts

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
layers in the parts lots of parts

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.480 
layers in the parts lots of parts
hundreds<00:01:08.579> maybe<00:01:09.439> forget<00:01:10.439> about<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:13.280> you<00:01:14.280> see

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
hundreds maybe forget about that you see

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.510 
hundreds maybe forget about that you see
these<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.970> shape<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.479> not<00:01:15.770> cubic<00:01:16.770> like

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
these the shape is not cubic like

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.959 
these the shape is not cubic like
shangzhou<00:01:18.150> 7x7<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:21.170> little<00:01:22.170> bit<00:01:22.289> smaller<00:01:22.950> as<00:01:23.399> i

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:23.969 
shangzhou 7x7 a little bit smaller as i

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:28.870 
shangzhou 7x7 a little bit smaller as i
as<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.929> see<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:26.539> my<00:01:27.539> hands<00:01:27.960> are<00:01:28.049> hollow<00:01:28.469> deep

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
as you see and my hands are hollow deep

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.980 
as you see and my hands are hollow deep
so<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.119> don't<00:01:30.719> know<00:01:31.130> you<00:01:32.130> know<00:01:32.249> I'm<00:01:32.759> not<00:01:32.990> big

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
so I don't know you know I'm not big

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.889 
so I don't know you know I'm not big
cube<00:01:34.289> solver<00:01:34.679> so<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.819> just<00:01:36.210> an<00:01:36.450> unboxing

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
cube solver so this is just an unboxing

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.520 
cube solver so this is just an unboxing
I<00:01:37.289> tell<00:01:38.100> my<00:01:38.310> first<00:01:38.670> impression<00:01:39.270> nothing<00:01:40.259> more

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:44.639 
because I'm not reviewing it because I

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:47.539 
because I'm not reviewing it because I
can't<00:01:44.939> self<00:01:45.209> I<00:01:45.689> just<00:01:46.409> bought<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.649> just<00:01:47.459> to

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
can't self I just bought that just to

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.149 
can't self I just bought that just to
compare<00:01:47.939> not<00:01:48.600> nothing<00:01:49.049> else<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.709> won't<00:01:49.859> solve

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
compare not nothing else I won't solve

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.239 
compare not nothing else I won't solve
even<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:51.439> Changsha<00:01:52.439> as<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.679> know<00:01:52.799> was<00:01:53.039> the

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:53.249 
even that Changsha as you know was the

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:55.370 
even that Changsha as you know was the
best<00:01:54.170> 7x7

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
best 7x7

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:03.730 
best 7x7
as<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.889> know<00:01:56.249> in<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:57.299> market<00:01:58.289> but<00:02:00.319> now<00:02:01.319> it's

much corner cut well this test well

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:10.100 
much corner cut well this test well
shame<00:05:08.729> she<00:05:08.909> looks<00:05:09.090> like<00:05:09.240> having<00:05:09.569> more<00:05:09.779> corner

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:11.809 
it's a little bit better than Shan Xiao
I<00:07:07.639> don't<00:07:08.639> know<00:07:09.620> the<00:07:10.620> comparing<00:07:11.190> because<00:07:11.580> I

00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:11.819 
I don't know the comparing because I

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:15.920 
I don't know the comparing because I
never<00:07:12.300> used<00:07:12.750> them<00:07:13.169> by<00:07:13.409> seven<00:07:13.800> before<00:07:14.810> and<00:07:15.810> I

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:15.930 
never used them by seven before and I

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.760 
never used them by seven before and I
think<00:07:16.560> I<00:07:16.680> won't<00:07:16.889> use<00:07:17.009> it<00:07:17.250> for<00:07:18.229> for<00:07:19.229> a<00:07:19.259> long<00:07:19.500> time

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:19.770 
think I won't use it for for a long time

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:27.320 
think I won't use it for for a long time
because<00:07:20.039> I'm<00:07:20.520> not<00:07:20.550> a<00:07:20.960> geek<00:07:21.960> you<00:07:22.289> fun<00:07:26.150> but<00:07:27.150> the

it's<00:07:33.330> not<00:07:33.840> that<00:07:34.169> expensive<00:07:35.009> comparing<00:07:35.759> that

00:07:35.899 --> 00:07:35.909 
it's not that expensive comparing that

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:39.770 
it's not that expensive comparing that
one<00:07:36.530> just<00:07:37.530> twenty<00:07:38.099> dollars<00:07:38.430> or<00:07:39.240> something
