another<00:02:49.800> common<00:02:50.220> misconception<00:02:50.310> is<00:02:51.000> that

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
another common misconception is that

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.210 
another common misconception is that
living<00:02:51.900> stones<00:02:52.200> too<00:02:52.380> expensive<00:02:52.890> we<00:02:52.920> can't

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
living stones too expensive we can't

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.190 
living stones too expensive we can't
afford<00:02:53.310> them<00:02:53.700> actually<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:54.690> truth<00:02:54.840> is<00:02:55.140> that

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
afford them actually the truth is that

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.830 
afford them actually the truth is that
our<00:02:55.770> company<00:02:56.550> has<00:02:56.580> very<00:02:57.060> little<00:02:57.270> overhead<00:02:57.540> and

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
our company has very little overhead and

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.660 
our company has very little overhead and
so<00:02:58.020> our<00:02:58.140> price<00:02:58.350> point<00:02:58.620> is<00:02:58.770> usually<00:02:59.220> our<00:02:59.340> profit

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
so our price point is usually our profit

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.850 
so our price point is usually our profit
margin<00:02:59.700> is<00:03:00.090> usually<00:03:00.480> less<00:03:00.630> than<00:03:00.830> majority<00:03:01.830> of

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
margin is usually less than majority of

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.680 
margin is usually less than majority of
builders<00:03:02.280> it's<00:03:02.760> just<00:03:03.000> that<00:03:03.180> we<00:03:03.300> stress

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
builders it's just that we stress

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.810 
builders it's just that we stress
quality<00:03:04.230> our<00:03:04.380> clients<00:03:04.800> choose<00:03:05.010> quality<00:03:05.370> and

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
quality our clients choose quality and

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.210 
quality our clients choose quality and
so<00:03:06.210> then<00:03:06.360> it<00:03:06.450> becomes<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.870> decision<00:03:07.710> of<00:03:07.830> value

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
so then it becomes a decision of value

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.150 
so then it becomes a decision of value
versus<00:03:08.670> cost<00:03:08.880> what<00:03:09.870> is<00:03:09.990> the<00:03:10.110> best<00:03:10.290> value<00:03:10.860> for

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160
