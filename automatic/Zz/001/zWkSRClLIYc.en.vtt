just<00:01:36.520> to<00:01:36.640> separate<00:01:37.030> all<00:01:37.240> the<00:01:37.719> fine<00:01:38.939> pastry

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
just to separate all the fine pastry

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.749 
just to separate all the fine pastry
sheet<00:01:40.149> layers<00:01:40.420> and<00:01:41.189> then<00:01:42.189> we're<00:01:42.340> gonna<00:01:42.429> flavor

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
sheet layers and then we're gonna flavor

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.380 
sheet layers and then we're gonna flavor
it<00:01:42.880> by<00:01:43.030> adding<00:01:43.360> some<00:01:43.539> cinnamon<00:01:44.020> sugar<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:46.030> a

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
it by adding some cinnamon sugar and a

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.399 
it by adding some cinnamon sugar and a
little<00:01:46.659> bit<00:01:46.780> of<00:01:46.899> melted<00:01:47.049> butter<00:01:49.020> now<00:01:50.020> I<00:01:50.049> put

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
little bit of melted butter now I put

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:51.870 
little bit of melted butter now I put
the<00:01:50.500> sugar<00:01:50.679> first<00:01:51.100> I<00:01:51.340> probably<00:01:51.549> should<00:01:51.789> have

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
the sugar first I probably should have

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.190 
the sugar first I probably should have
put<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.119> butter<00:01:52.299> first<00:01:52.869> it<00:01:53.020> would<00:01:53.110> have

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
put the butter first it would have

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.630 
put the butter first it would have
probably<00:01:53.289> been<00:01:53.530> easier<00:01:53.860> to<00:01:53.950> coat<00:01:54.219> them<00:01:54.429> that

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
probably been easier to coat them that

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.240 
probably been easier to coat them that
way<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:58.600> as<00:01:58.929> I<00:01:59.079> mentioned<00:01:59.470> I'm<00:01:59.530> just<00:01:59.709> making<00:02:00.099> a

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
way and as I mentioned I'm just making a

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.499 
way and as I mentioned I'm just making a
few<00:02:00.489> of<00:02:00.579> them<00:02:00.700> so<00:02:00.729> I'm<00:02:00.880> just<00:02:00.909> putting<00:02:01.299> a<00:02:01.360> little

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
few of them so I'm just putting a little

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.179 
few of them so I'm just putting a little
bit<00:02:01.630> of<00:02:01.750> each<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:05.140> just<00:02:05.319> gently<00:02:05.560> toss<00:02:05.920> these

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
bit of each so just gently toss these

way they are if I thought that they

would stay in place a bit better if

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.740 
would stay in place a bit better if
there<00:03:49.640> was<00:03:49.730> a<00:03:49.760> little<00:03:49.910> bit<00:03:50.030> of<00:03:50.120> frosting<00:03:50.569> in

there was a little bit of frosting in
the<00:03:50.870> nest<00:03:51.080> and<00:03:51.580> then<00:03:52.580> just<00:03:52.819> place<00:03:53.360> the<00:03:53.540> eggs<00:03:53.720> in

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
the nest and then just place the eggs in

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.850 
the nest and then just place the eggs in
and<00:03:54.470> there<00:03:55.280> you<00:03:55.430> go<00:03:55.610> very<00:03:56.420> simple<00:03:56.800> but<00:03:57.800> very

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860

and there you go very simple but very
cute<00:03:59.560> now<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.620> another<00:04:00.800> alternative<00:04:01.519> to<00:04:01.640> this

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
cute now the another alternative to this

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.750 
cute now the another alternative to this
would<00:04:02.569> be<00:04:02.600> to<00:04:02.810> make<00:04:03.110> little<00:04:03.380> birds<00:04:03.709> and<00:04:04.640> I

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
would be to make little birds and I

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.460 
would be to make little birds and I

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:06.590 
I'll Easter treat just on their own I

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.320 
I'll Easter treat just on their own I
find<00:07:07.160> this<00:07:07.280> a<00:07:07.340> little<00:07:07.550> big<00:07:07.820> to<00:07:08.000> put<00:07:08.210> on<00:07:08.300> a

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:08.330 
find this a little big to put on a

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.110 
find this a little big to put on a
cupcake<00:07:08.600> it<00:07:08.930> I<00:07:09.020> think<00:07:09.200> it'd<00:07:09.290> be<00:07:09.320> just<00:07:09.440> too<00:07:09.830> much

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120 
cupcake it I think it'd be just too much

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.460 
cupcake it I think it'd be just too much
but<00:07:11.120> you<00:07:11.240> could<00:07:11.450> try<00:07:11.630> to<00:07:11.750> make<00:07:11.960> the<00:07:12.080> nest

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:12.470 
but you could try to make the nest

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.020 
but you could try to make the nest
smaller<00:07:12.980> by<00:07:13.190> breaking<00:07:13.580> the<00:07:13.670> chow<00:07:13.850> mein

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:14.030 
smaller by breaking the chow mein

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.820 
smaller by breaking the chow mein
noodles<00:07:14.090> up<00:07:14.480> into<00:07:14.690> smaller<00:07:14.960> pieces<00:07:15.050> as<00:07:15.560> well

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:15.830 
noodles up into smaller pieces as well

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.640 
noodles up into smaller pieces as well
so<00:07:16.460> you<00:07:16.610> do<00:07:16.700> have<00:07:16.850> alternatives<00:07:17.200> so<00:07:18.200> there

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:18.650 
so you do have alternatives so there

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:19.780 
so you do have alternatives so there
they<00:07:18.890> are<00:07:18.920> the<00:07:19.370> little

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:19.790 
they are the little

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.050 
they are the little
bluebirds<00:07:20.300> in<00:07:20.720> the<00:07:20.780> nest<00:07:21.530> I<00:07:21.610> thought<00:07:22.610> this<00:07:22.820> one

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:23.060 
bluebirds in the nest I thought this one

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.660 
bluebirds in the nest I thought this one
turned<00:07:23.240> out<00:07:23.360> really<00:07:23.570> good<00:07:23.870> and<00:07:24.490> the<00:07:25.490> other

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:25.670 
turned out really good and the other

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.120 
turned out really good and the other
little<00:07:26.150> pastel<00:07:26.630> colored<00:07:26.690> chocolate<00:07:27.530> eggs<00:07:27.860> in

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:28.130 
little pastel colored chocolate eggs in

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:32.020 
little pastel colored chocolate eggs in
a<00:07:28.220> nest<00:07:28.250> I<00:07:29.620> also<00:07:30.620> tried<00:07:31.040> putting<00:07:31.340> some<00:07:31.910> of

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:32.030 
a nest I also tried putting some of

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.670 
a nest I also tried putting some of
those<00:07:32.120> little<00:07:32.390> jelly<00:07:32.570> beans<00:07:32.840> in<00:07:33.200> the<00:07:33.410> phyllo

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.680 
those little jelly beans in the phyllo

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.320 
those little jelly beans in the phyllo
nest<00:07:33.710> and<00:07:34.130> I<00:07:34.160> thought<00:07:34.340> that<00:07:34.550> was<00:07:34.700> really<00:07:34.910> cute

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:35.330 
nest and I thought that was really cute

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.420 
nest and I thought that was really cute
as<00:07:35.600> well<00:07:35.870> and<00:07:36.110> there<00:07:36.350> are<00:07:36.560> the<00:07:36.980> chow<00:07:37.220> mein

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:37.430 
as well and there are the chow mein
