00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
I'm going down here and I'm not hitting

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.460 
I'm going down here and I'm not hitting
the<00:01:52.000> strings<00:01:52.330> with<00:01:52.569> the<00:01:52.600> slide<00:01:52.899> until<00:01:53.259> the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
the strings with the slide until the

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.419 
the strings with the slide until the
fourth<00:01:53.770> fret<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:55.479> first<00:01:55.720> part<00:01:55.960> is<00:01:56.470> fourth

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
fourth fret so the first part is fourth

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.570 
fourth fret so the first part is fourth
to<00:01:57.580> fifth<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.950> next<00:02:00.190> part<00:02:00.399> is<00:02:00.490> open<00:02:00.850> to<00:02:00.970> fifth

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
to fifth the next part is open to fifth

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.440 
to fifth the next part is open to fifth
then<00:02:03.580> you<00:02:03.670> go<00:02:03.759> back<00:02:03.909> down<00:02:04.060> to<00:02:04.090> open

then you go back down to open

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.139 
then you go back down to open
third<00:02:06.409> fret

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
third fret

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:16.509 
third fret
open<00:02:09.459> so<00:02:10.459> first<00:02:11.000> part<00:02:12.819> second<00:02:13.819> part<00:02:15.519> third

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
open so first part second part third

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:38.710 
open so first part second part third
part

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:53.380 

now<00:02:39.650> we're<00:02:39.830> gonna<00:02:39.920> speed<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.370> out<00:02:52.330> now<00:02:53.330> you

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
now we're gonna speed it out now you

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.590 
now we're gonna speed it out now you
might<00:02:53.660> see<00:02:53.900> me<00:02:54.050> do<00:02:54.200> some<00:02:54.380> vibrato<00:02:55.330> this<00:02:56.330> that's

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
might see me do some vibrato this that's

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.720 
might see me do some vibrato this that's
a<00:02:56.690> natural<00:02:57.050> thing<00:02:57.230> I<00:02:57.260> can't<00:02:57.680> not<00:02:57.890> do<00:02:58.100> it<00:02:58.220> so<00:02:58.520> if

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
a natural thing I can't not do it so if

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.090 
a natural thing I can't not do it so if
you're<00:02:58.880> wondering<00:02:59.290> it's<00:03:00.290> I'm<00:03:00.620> just<00:03:00.650> jiggling

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
you're wondering it's I'm just jiggling

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.790 
you're wondering it's I'm just jiggling
this<00:03:01.490> slide<00:03:01.850> it<00:03:02.210> takes<00:03:02.570> a<00:03:02.720> little<00:03:02.900> bit<00:03:03.050> of<00:03:03.200> a

this slide it takes a little bit of a
little<00:03:04.640> bit<00:03:04.730> of<00:03:04.820> practice<00:03:05.210> to<00:03:05.390> do<00:03:05.570> it<00:03:05.750> don't

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
little bit of practice to do it don't

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.050 
little bit of practice to do it don't
worry<00:03:06.200> about<00:03:06.350> it<00:03:06.560> right<00:03:06.680> now<00:03:06.790> but<00:03:07.790> if<00:03:07.910> you're

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
Bato I'm just doing a real quick jiggle

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.070 
Bato I'm just doing a real quick jiggle
of<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.820> slide<00:03:15.130> so<00:03:16.130> I'm<00:03:16.280> sliding<00:03:16.930> slightly<00:03:17.930> up

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
of the slide so I'm sliding slightly up

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.140 
of the slide so I'm sliding slightly up
and<00:03:18.320> slightly<00:03:18.560> down<00:03:18.920> below<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.610> fret<00:03:19.850> above

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
and slightly down below the fret above

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.970 
and slightly down below the fret above
it<00:03:20.330> and<00:03:20.480> below<00:03:20.540> it<00:03:21.080> and<00:03:21.290> above<00:03:21.560> it<00:03:21.740> and<00:03:21.920> below

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
it and below it and above it and below

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.130 
it and below it and above it and below
it<00:03:22.250> it's<00:03:22.670> just<00:03:22.850> for<00:03:23.030> ATO<00:03:23.210> like<00:03:23.570> somebody<00:03:23.870> sings

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
it it's just for ATO like somebody sings

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:37.720 
it it's just for ATO like somebody sings
a<00:03:24.260> note<00:03:24.440> and<00:03:24.620> they<00:03:24.680> go<00:03:24.830> ah<00:03:25.480> same<00:03:26.480> idea

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.790
