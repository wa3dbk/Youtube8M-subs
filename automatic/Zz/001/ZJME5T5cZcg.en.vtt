what<00:01:36.229> broad<00:01:36.470> offers<00:01:36.860> maybe<00:01:37.159> some<00:01:37.430> of<00:01:37.520> the

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
what broad offers maybe some of the

think<00:01:39.290> that's<00:01:39.409> a<00:01:39.530> good<00:01:39.619> idea<00:01:39.740> our<00:01:40.159> graduates

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
think that's a good idea our graduates

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.910 
think that's a good idea our graduates
understand<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:41.509> business<00:01:41.869> as<00:01:42.020> a<00:01:42.049> whole<00:01:42.320> it's

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
understand the business as a whole it's

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.100 
understand the business as a whole it's
not<00:01:43.070> just<00:01:43.610> about<00:01:43.880> supply<00:01:44.390> chain<00:01:44.659> management
