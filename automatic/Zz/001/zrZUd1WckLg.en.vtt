00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
realized that interesting phenomenon is

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.370 
realized that interesting phenomenon is
it<00:03:13.459> doesn't<00:03:14.180> have<00:03:14.330> the<00:03:14.630> how<00:03:14.750> do<00:03:14.810> you<00:03:15.020> think<00:03:15.170> you

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380
