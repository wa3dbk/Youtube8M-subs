00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.840
 I will do my best to post the gunpla production video 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:11.030
 production of the first grade Char's Zaku ii 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.030
 We think that we want to carry out inking this time 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:22.210
 Partial painting has been done here by the last time 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:27.730
 first grade Shahs will also be a party for Zac 2 so from now on 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:30.090
 I'm here Tamiya's smearing paint black I want to do the violet using this 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.090
 I think that 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:38.900
 So this is the lower part I used to mix it last time 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:41.480
 In still to use the paint but I'm playing the cutter mat 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:45.680
 This white mat of 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.980
 It stood dirty no way a little cutter matohu of previous acts of this kind of feeling 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.200
 I will 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:55.920
 Then I think that I want to do with ink 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.920
 By the way, I'm very happy that the paint put in the room is very easy to use . 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.440
 This kit is 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:13.350
 As mold is contained fairly well for 300 yen 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.820
 Quite 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.110
 It is that there is a challenging towards the stepped 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.340
 It is fun to do was 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:28.590
 It is a miracle that you have to be careful with this smear putting paint 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:32.790
 I'm pouring paint, but it's time to pour it 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:38.010
 This though is poured against the mold of Slaughters Let's Go to the kind of party estuary 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:44.030
 Parts are a little more complicated in shape, so let's pour in a slightly unnatural posture 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:48.260
 If it happens, parts other than this hair tip may touch parts of this side or a certain part. 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:55.250
 So this is a little bit like this part 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:02:02.300
 If you try to flow high into the hollowed part of such a part child, this root part 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:04.020
 I'll touch this area , and if you do, you'll see Dobat and 4 paints here. 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:09.030
 Have you been poured in? 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.769
 There are times when the part that doesn't work is completely black, so it's OK if you wipe it off 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:16.819
 But there is 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:22.730
 Please be careful to use only the tip of the hair not to prevent too much part 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:24.889
 I'm concentrating too much on the goose violet, but the paint is on the other part of the part or the finger and the bat 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.910
 Because there is also a thing 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:34.330
 Please be careful with your cather and noodles if you use it 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:36.260
 It was completely completed to the person who put in the smear, so I haven't dried the paint yet 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.370
 There is a great place 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:44.599
 There is something in this head part of the tarp 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:50.480
 This part is a black part but the box is already part 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:51.430
 Is a red or pink color, so this is the black part of this not here 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.950
 The 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.420
 It is the same enamel paint as sumi-e paint 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:03.140
 If you choose this 4 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.500
 I would like to paint here, though it is flat black or matte black 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.690
 Yup 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:13.560
 It painted a quick in the paint with because it only paint a little 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:18.819
 Since the same pattern is melt amount and take the same Sumiri 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:22.819
 Than you can wipe off later be so so Javi 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:25.380
 If you are not serious here 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:30.160
 I think I want to paint 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:32.370
 Hm 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.370
 Hmm 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.140
 It has been 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.330
 Hmm 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:54.620
 Hmm 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:04:02.690
 Painting is also complete I think that this paint is a little like Kirk's 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:05.330
 So I wrote the paint here It is cotton swab dipped this choice of solvent protruding eco paint 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.190
 I want to take the part 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.850
 Hmm 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:14.920
 is 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:17.910
 This member is so pointed that it is very useful for young people 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.940
 If the point is thick, it will freeze too much 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.510
 To the point where you do not want to drop it 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:29.300
 Because I drop it once 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:32.420
 We dropped little by little with the place so fine that there is no Tokita miss 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:37.310
 The part painted black with a small brush is also highly ignited 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:40.249
 I think I want to hear beautiful even good Beckman 6 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:45.099
 Because it is the same enamel paint 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:45.099
 You can wipe it the same way as you stepped on 

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:50.439
 Hmm 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.110
 Hmm 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:04.770
 Ah ah ah 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:04.770
 The next time that it has completed a professional two people I think would like to assemble these parts 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.850
 management
