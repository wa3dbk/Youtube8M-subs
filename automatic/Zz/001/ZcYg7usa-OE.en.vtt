went<00:01:07.530> haywire<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.640> shoot<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:10.310> shut<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.670> only

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
went haywire it shoot it shut it only

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.969 
went haywire it shoot it shut it only
went<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.420> about<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.750> quarter<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.290> an<00:01:13.409> inch<00:01:13.590> and

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979

went in about a quarter of an inch and
then<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.430> came<00:01:14.610> out<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:15.000> side<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.960> was<00:01:16.140> a

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
then it came out to side and I was a

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.440 
then it came out to side and I was a
holding<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.820> should<00:01:18.150> have<00:01:18.270> went

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
holding it like that it should have went

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.270 
holding it like that it should have went
straight<00:01:18.840> food<00:01:19.880> should<00:01:20.880> have<00:01:21.210> but<00:01:21.960> yeah<00:01:22.280> all

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
straight food should have but yeah all

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.160 
straight food should have but yeah all
right<00:01:23.610> let's<00:01:23.850> get<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.150> with<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:26.900> let's<00:01:27.900> cut

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
right let's get on with it let's cut

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.990 
right let's get on with it let's cut
that<00:01:28.380> off<00:01:29.900> and<00:01:30.900> just<00:01:31.170> get<00:01:31.409> around<00:01:32.000> extractor

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
that off and just get around extractor

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.850 
that off and just get around extractor
and<00:01:35.299> probably<00:01:36.299> from<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.960> point<00:01:37.229> on<00:01:37.590> they

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
and probably from this point on they

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.980 
and probably from this point on they
probably<00:01:38.250> will<00:01:38.670> be<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> little<00:01:39.329> more<00:01:39.689> distance

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
probably will be a little more distance

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.370 
probably will be a little more distance
between<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.860> finger<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.880> nailer<00:01:42.869> such

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
between the finger and the nailer such

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:54.620 
between the finger and the nailer such
as<00:01:43.710> this

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.240 

see<00:01:55.630> you<00:01:55.960> know<00:01:56.080> I<00:01:56.110> can<00:01:56.440> blame<00:01:56.650> it<00:01:56.830> on<00:01:56.950> what<00:01:57.220> i

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
see you know I can blame it on what i

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
wood because every one of those nails

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.120 
wood because every one of those nails
went<00:02:01.300> in<00:02:01.479> there<00:02:01.750> followed<00:02:02.260> that<00:02:02.380> growth<00:02:02.740> ring

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
went in there followed that growth ring

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.150 
went in there followed that growth ring
and<00:02:03.430> shot<00:02:04.420> out<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.780> side<00:02:05.020> so<00:02:05.770> I'm<00:02:05.920> going<00:02:06.130> to

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
and shot out the side so I'm going to

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.660 
and shot out the side so I'm going to
take<00:02:06.369> that<00:02:06.430> off<00:02:07.740> remove<00:02:08.740> that<00:02:09.009> let's<00:02:09.280> get<00:02:09.459> that

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
take that off remove that let's get that

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.149
