00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.939
 Hello my daddy has my dad today 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:21.150
 birthday and what could be better 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:23.310
 give as something a little homemade 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.380
 besides the gift, of course, that he's on 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.529
 so we have requested every case 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.529
 take a roll of puff pastry the recipe 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.730
 is as simple as simple as ingenious you 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.800
 really only needs a role 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.540
 puff pastry I always take that from 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.790
 I love the little love I have 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.800
 already tried a lot and a 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.600
 So little fruit spread so three 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.489
 four tablespoons is enough in any case 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.280
 just do not take too much else swells 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.559
 in the end everything out gas is so easy 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.750
 that there is almost no video needed around you 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.239
 to show that but yes we start and 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.640
 I finish the puff pastry and share 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.620
 from the left side a similar piece 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.359
 like on the right side so me 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.100
 Leave ten centimeters in the middle 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.890
 so I think it is better described 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.990
 and now I find the right side and 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.390
 the left thick side with the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.009
 fruit spread but only very thin 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.200
 because I do not want that to me then 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.850
 Everything that swells apart is important 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.530
 really in the middle ten centimeters 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.450
 leave room because that will be 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.220
 our heart tip so that you too 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.920
 A heart can recognize much more important 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.080
 but as the accurate heart is the will 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.320
 who counts here as always puts this to you 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.880
 please horizontal to the piece so not 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.829
 lie down vertically understand her what I understand 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.220
 mine is here too, then I start 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.130
 one side slowly and carefully 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.780
 to roll up to my mark that 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.490
 you also do not have to mark you can 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.470
 make it free as always 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.280
 in my recipes you are here completely 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.280
 free in the design 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.710
 then the whole thing breaks down around us 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.689
 the second page up and again 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.960
 here to the middle so that the me 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:00.960
 stay free in the middle ten centimeters 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.880
 if I did that I take it 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.039
 a small basin with water and 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.660
 A brush turns me on the role 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.810
 a bit so that I work well 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.690
 Can and brush the one longitudinal side with 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.180
 so i water the second over it 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.340
 can lay that and then that holds 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.100
 is like a kind of adhesive that holds 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.350
 really wonderful together then roll 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.239
 I put the whole thing in my daddy 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.180
 a little board and give the whole 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.069
 for about 45 minutes in the freezer compartment 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.260
 yes, here you see me again like me 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.360
 lace model your just a bit 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.370
 shallow press that will be the later 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.370
 at least that's the theory 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.540
 In the meantime , I can already 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.030
 clean up the kitchen there is today 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.410
 clean up not much but I want it 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.220
 to be right , I still have each one 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.220
 amount to do today 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.610
 then we take that out of the freezer 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.680
 that is already a bit on 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.810
 frozen and thus can be that 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.790
 I cut all very very well 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.310
 Watch it for about five minutes and 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.470
 then take a water-moistened with the 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.750
 knife and then cuts about 1 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.030
 centimeter thick slices of mine 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.160
 role put the whole on one 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.650
 Baking paper lined baking tray and 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.720
 please leave a little space because of the 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.550
 Herzchen do not care much 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.900
 but a bit not that you guys 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.700
 glue together then you have at the end 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.470
 Difficulties apart 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.050
 get that works fine 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.030
 So just let about 23 inches 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.400
 space between the little hearts 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.980
 and then the whole goes at 200 degrees approx 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.980
 15 to 20 minutes in the oven 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.350
 you can do the whole thing relatively fast 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.030
 I stay in the room during this time 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.760
 again my kitchen on today there are 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.740
 nothing to clean up I'm glad that 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.120
 the recipe works so fast and 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.640
 I was then but bring something to 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.650
 This afternoon it looks like this 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.990
 when it comes out of the oven, it's gorgeous 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.520
 fruity fresh nice brown so you 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.740
 can you take out if that with you 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.330
 The marmalade is a beautiful brown 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.430
 Slightly thrown out, what I did 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:21.220
 not at all bad here 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.710
 It does not have to look perfect 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.510
 but must taste perfect no fun 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.550

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.980
