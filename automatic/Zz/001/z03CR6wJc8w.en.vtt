00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:11.809
 Hello to the presentation of the jet team 3 m 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:16.260
 per 3m per seat the military series 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:20.869
 military from jetbird and come here 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:31.800
 with a full 1100 lumens and the new one 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:34.710
 relatively 9x plc xbl is now 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.239
 not completely new but relative 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.559
 few series lamps is currently installed 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.379
 in terms of performance compare with 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:48.239
 however, an xml two has the footprint 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:50.520
 on the board of a xpg and has 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.980
 the dom on it is really one 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.920
 slightly larger surface are 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.510
 quite a bit smaller 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:08.270
 what else theoretically a little more 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:08.270
 supplied yes that is the med 3m pro 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.360
 the processing of the lamp is completely eg 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.310
 month a typical a very high very 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.840
 high level 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:23.240
 Great processed and the lamp leaves 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.240
 Feel good analyze great 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.640
 actually used to everything from bled 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:35.060
 the halt usual very high quality of 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.440
 b2 this is very aggressive mine 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.940
 look for very deep recesses 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.460
 unbelievable sharp so I do not have 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.650
 a lot of lamps and many 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.650
 Synchronous here on it but the me 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:52.070
 I'm far from being so keen 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:57.410
 above this model can be the band 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.880
 is theoretically here than for these 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:03.680
 still different color filters 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:15.560
 Inserts are possible as well 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:22.100
 more aggressive screwed typical 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:24.110
 hotel cap with forward kiki and the 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.740
 Side recesses that is it 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.740
 also possible 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:37.220
 because they are the warrior in this picture 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:43.580
 just bad off your head sideways one 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:48.740
 small brass contact small brass 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:51.080
 blog that means there is no protection 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:55.670
 you have to deceive batteries 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:58.190
 Watch the polarity yourself a bit 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.750
 the right polarity of the battery is 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:05.120
 but here on the lamp but here 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:09.830
 have the plus here always the minus me 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.980
 use at the time 1 18 650 with the the 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.380
 indicated lamp 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.650
 960 lumens at the 15 o'clock reached the 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:22.670
 advertised 1100 flowers are achieved 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.680
 if 216 340 rechargeable batteries are used 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.520
 I can do both these values 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.730
 to confirm 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:32.480
 I measured the lamp with 218 3 50 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:37.430
 mr batteries and here I come to the 1000th 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:40.340
 100 lumens of the 18 650 battery on 960 das 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.890
 fits everything but also prepare 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.150
 I think that's very nice the previous year 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.760
 to see if I already have this 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:52.280
 clip the clip is on two sides of the 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:58.790
 to demonstrate lufthansa I can 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:59.590
 quasi high the lamp, this routes to 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.780
 cliffs 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:09.350
 So that's the upside down 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:11.570
 on the way or in this way with the 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.690
 head down very well for me 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:17.359
 made a clip two ways and 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.400
 he himself clicks it in one 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.260
 guide rail embedded around it 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.680
 the head must be removed 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.150
 become 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.470
 and even then the clip goes 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.010
 it's easy to get out of this 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.010
 glued 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:38.180
 the light of the lamp is beautiful pure 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:40.240
 I think something on the camera 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.910
 clearer than it is a real one 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:49.490
 pretty intense spot through the 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:51.860
 the pretty deep reflector yes that 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:56.570
 Lamb has two general modes 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:58.360
 Once head firmly in the head is going on 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:02.180
 head tightened, there is only one model 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:05.840
 the folk polish will take three minutes 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.370
 kept that down nothing 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.580
 No matter how many times I'm here somehow 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.010
 do not activate the moment or so 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:18.200
 this brightness level always stays 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:20.840
 If I head off now we'll solve it here 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.720
 I think that will be the lowest run 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:28.280
 advertised with a now that is so gentleman 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.600
 between 1 and 3 lumens 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.610
 should be pretty low for most 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:37.430
 falls loose and while doing the 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.020
 you have to have forward clique dani 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:45.110
 before we switch through we still have 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:47.840
 stream there comes a home with blue and 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.280
 then the firefly what you get here now 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.400
 just seen easily I have been 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.800
 had to go again to see people strip 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.770
 in the beer the show that this lamp 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.450
 unfortunately god war 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.290
 Here you can easily see this 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:05.540
 Lamps often with pwm me personally it is 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.600
 not yet in use 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:11.570
 noticed disturbing but fully said 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.330
 be this lamp pwm and in the second 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:17.600
 Mode is in normal writes 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:20.840
 operating current included very nice 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.510
 made by this theme here that 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.890
 firefly 1 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:27.080
 i can now use the lamp so user in 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.600
 firefly and should be something 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:33.380
 I need a lot of light turning the fast 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:37.590
 head firmly and from turbo I solve now 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:44.780
 my head is firefly again 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:44.780
 whether firmly headless well regulated I think 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.580
 nice for everyday life 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:53.730
 the pwm I think not so nice but 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.750
 as I said so far has not bothered me 

00:06:53.730 --> 00:07:00.290
 I also only by chance 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:07:02.820
 noticed that that has ever yes 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:04.770
 All in all , it is a man 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:09.600
 really nice solid and sturdy 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:12.090
 lamp the predecessor models of the 3m money 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.560
 me also as very robust I say 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:18.270
 indestructible I do not want to say but 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:19.350
 very robust and i think these lamps 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:22.470
 definitely worth a look 

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:25.880
 I personally find the new led straight now 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.880
 in this lamp a great combination 

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:31.530
 and i can miss this lamp real 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:33.420
 So how will my new companion if 

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:36.990
 it's a little bigger and something 

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:41.460
 may be more light thanks for looking 

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:42.780
 There will be another one below in the text attachment 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:46.760
 give link for a review in 

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:50.390
 flashlight forums with pictures and text 

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.390
 thanks for watching
