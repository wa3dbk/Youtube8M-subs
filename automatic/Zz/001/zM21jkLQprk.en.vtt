00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.360
 to make a garden of strawberries 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:19.539
 we will need 500 g of strawberries 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.760
 70 g of sugar 5 sheets of gelatin 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.289
 will make an oreo emulsion a potting soil 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.420
 of oreo for the potting soil he we 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.119
 will require two packages of oreo for 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.269
 the emulsion 200 g of liquid cream 140 g 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.529
 of milk 160 g of the golden filling and 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.800
 with three sheets of gelatin and 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.790
 some strawberries to finish this dish 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.470
 to make the strawberry jelly I 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.120
 wash the strawberries before listening to them 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.180
 to prevent water from coming back 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.050
 inside the strawberries I listen to them I 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.660
 put them in a salad bowl 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.820
 I add the 70 g of sugar I put a 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.440
 film paper and I place in the microwave 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.050
 for 5 to 6 minutes 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.400
 finally to reduce the strawberries of 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.870
 burst and extract the juice 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.790
 once the fees come out of the microwave 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.330
 I listen to them I pass them in a 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.130
 Chinese 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.410
 I soak the leaves of 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.659
 gelatin in ice water once 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.890
 to be at peace I have them out I put 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.650
 the gelatin leaves in the juice of 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:12.160
 warm strawberry I mix I put in a 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:14.530
 salad bowl on the ice or in the fridge for 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.510
 make the filling the emulsion 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.630
 of oreo I open the oreo packages 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.370
 near 2 I cut in two the oreo separates 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.980
 the biscuit of the cream 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.470
 I place the cream in a salad bowl 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.450
 weigh the milk the cream I soak 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.820
 the gelatin leaves I'm doing 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.520
 boil the milk the cream with the 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.880
 fill of reality I mix with a 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.530
 whip I place in a siphon and puts in 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.540
 fridge to actually make a 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.360
 whipped cream with a filling and a taste 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.040
 of oreo for the potting soil in a pan I 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.159
 heat the cookies that I mix 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.200
 afterwards to make a soil we come 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.760
 at the end of the recipe the age the catches 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.250
 we will get a gardener 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.350
 food to achieve as a small 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.030
 strawberry garden we will pour on the 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.690
 background the jelly that will have already taken and 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.600
 quavering 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:05.380
 we will put on the top the emulsion 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.299
 of oreo that we will get out of the bomb at 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.769
 chantilly we will finish with the potting soil 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.270
 to achieve as a land and we will 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.280
 come to plant on the top a few 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.400
 strawberries and if you're lucky enough to have a 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.040
 strawberry plan 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.989
 who will come to give the total illusion on 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.459
 can even add some herbs 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.890
 who end up in a garden like 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.819
 the purslane or some flowers will come 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.819
 decorate this dish
