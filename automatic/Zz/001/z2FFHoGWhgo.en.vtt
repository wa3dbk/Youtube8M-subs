we'll go back to the create tab and I'll

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.230 
we'll go back to the create tab and I'll
say<00:01:49.270> let's<00:01:49.600> create<00:01:49.780> a<00:01:50.170> panel<00:01:51.060> first<00:01:52.060> thing<00:01:52.180> I

this kind of a shape to it
now<00:02:05.500> I'll<00:02:05.650> populate<00:02:06.160> the<00:02:06.280> grid<00:02:06.520> let's<00:02:07.090> say

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
now I'll populate the grid let's say

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.169 
now I'll populate the grid let's say
just<00:02:07.890> drop<00:02:08.890> all<00:02:09.100> the<00:02:09.250> students<00:02:09.610> in<00:02:09.700> one<00:02:09.910> after

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
on each one of the frames I'm going to

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.460 
on each one of the frames I'm going to
go<00:02:29.770> all<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:29.980> way<00:02:30.010> down<00:02:30.220> to<00:02:30.400> zero<00:02:30.760> order<00:02:31.210> and
