00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.850 
really on a good level at the end I was

unfortunately I'm a bit disappointed

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.260 
unfortunately I'm a bit disappointed
with<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.970> last<00:00:39.180> day<00:00:39.390> today<00:00:40.199> was<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:41.000> was<00:00:42.000> really

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
with the last day today was I was really

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.970 
with the last day today was I was really
aggressive<00:00:42.449> I<00:00:42.900> attacked<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.590> take<00:00:43.800> off

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
aggressive I attacked that to take off

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.400 
aggressive I attacked that to take off
but<00:00:44.220> the<00:00:44.460> flying<00:00:44.730> didn't<00:00:45.510> went<00:00:45.720> well<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.260> this

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
but the flying didn't went well and this

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.180 
but the flying didn't went well and this
it's<00:00:46.980> it's<00:00:47.820> more<00:00:48.059> things<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.629> decide

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
it's it's more things that decide

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.870 
it's it's more things that decide
whether<00:00:50.190> there<00:00:50.880> is<00:00:51.000> fun<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.450> the<00:00:51.570> air<00:00:51.720> or<00:00:52.110> just

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
whether there is fun in the air or just

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.979 
whether there is fun in the air or just
fighting<00:00:53.880> for<00:00:54.540> some<00:00:54.809> distance<00:00:56.510> do<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.570> think

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
fighting for some distance do you think

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.380 
fighting for some distance do you think
that<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:59.070> might<00:00:59.280> make<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.579> difference<00:01:00.180> if<00:01:00.300> you

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
that it might make a difference if you

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.750 
that it might make a difference if you
jumped<00:01:00.690> yesterday<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.350> training<00:01:01.760> no

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
jumped yesterday in the training no

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.650 
jumped yesterday in the training no
that's<00:01:03.589> it<00:01:04.589> was<00:01:04.770> a<00:01:04.800> good<00:01:05.070> strategy<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.850> really

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
that's it was a good strategy to really

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.590 
that's it was a good strategy to really
rest<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.290> need<00:01:07.410> it<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.240> therefore<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
rest I need it and therefore the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.499 
rest I need it and therefore the
tournament<00:01:10.050> was<00:01:10.200> quite<00:01:10.560> well<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:11.009> was<00:01:11.360> still<00:01:12.360> in

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
tournament was quite well I was still in

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.359 
tournament was quite well I was still in
a<00:01:12.600> good<00:01:12.750> shape<00:01:12.930> at<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.259> end<00:01:13.289> but<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.950> was<00:01:14.160> just

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
a good shape at the end but it was just

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.529 
a good shape at the end but it was just
the<00:01:14.490> aerodynamics<00:01:15.180> which<00:01:15.570> was<00:01:15.780> bad<00:01:16.020> today<00:01:16.259> and

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
the aerodynamics which was bad today and

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:21.200 
the aerodynamics which was bad today and
yeah<00:01:18.539> that<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:19.110> what<00:01:19.259> takes<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.920> fun<00:01:20.210> away

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
yeah that that what takes the fun away

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.800 
yeah that that what takes the fun away
from<00:01:21.420> from<00:01:21.990> my<00:01:22.140> jump<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.860> was<00:01:23.190> really<00:01:23.580> on<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.569> good

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
from from my jump I was really on a good

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.100 
from from my jump I was really on a good
way<00:01:24.959> in<00:01:25.140> three<00:01:25.590> Hills<00:01:25.830> before<00:01:26.789> and<00:01:27.030> but<00:01:27.869> that's

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
way in three Hills before and but that's

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.400 
way in three Hills before and but that's
it<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.440> accept<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:29.100> have<00:01:29.399> to<00:01:29.789> be<00:01:29.910> better<00:01:30.060> and

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
it I accept I have to be better and

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.589 
it I accept I have to be better and
that's<00:01:31.410> what<00:01:31.950> I'm<00:01:32.100> going<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.550> do<00:01:32.700> next<00:01:32.970> few

00:01:33.589 --> 00:01:33.599 
that's what I'm going to do next few

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:35.990 
that's what I'm going to do next few
weeks<00:01:33.890> do<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:34.979> think<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.429> it<00:01:35.580> was<00:01:35.759> one<00:01:35.970> of

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
weeks do you think that it was one of

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.520 
weeks do you think that it was one of
the<00:01:37.910> tightest<00:01:38.910> for<00:01:39.599> his<00:01:39.750> tournament<00:01:40.080> most

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
the tightest for his tournament most

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.169 
the tightest for his tournament most
difficult<00:01:41.009> ones<00:01:41.190> because<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.700> difference

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
difficult ones because the difference

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.040 
difficult ones because the difference
between<00:01:42.300> top<00:01:42.840> three<00:01:43.080> were<00:01:43.200> very<00:01:43.470> little<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:45.050> it

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
between top three were very little I it

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.719 
between top three were very little I it
might<00:01:46.319> be<00:01:46.560> interesting<00:01:47.099> for<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.340> for<00:01:47.640> the

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
might be interesting for the for the

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.770 
might be interesting for the for the
spectators<00:01:48.450> but<00:01:48.630> for<00:01:49.470> me<00:01:49.729> it<00:01:50.729> was<00:01:50.789> a<00:01:51.060> no<00:01:51.450> other

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
spectators but for me it was a no other

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.300 
spectators but for me it was a no other
choice<00:01:52.140> than<00:01:52.170> just<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.740> attack<00:01:53.069> after

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
choice than just to attack after

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.020 
choice than just to attack after
Garmisch<00:01:54.209> the<00:01:54.390> first<00:01:54.630> jump<00:01:55.229> there<00:01:55.440> was<00:01:56.030> too

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
Garmisch the first jump there was too

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.839 
Garmisch the first jump there was too
bad<00:01:57.240> but<00:01:57.599> that<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:59.039> might<00:01:59.220> happen<00:01:59.429> I<00:01:59.700> was

00:01:59.839 --> 00:01:59.849 
bad but that that might happen I was

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:02.120 
bad but that that might happen I was
fighting<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.300> come<00:02:00.569> back<00:02:00.860> didn't<00:02:01.860> make<00:02:01.979> enough

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
fighting to come back didn't make enough

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.139 
fighting to come back didn't make enough
points<00:02:02.489> in<00:02:02.670> Innsbruck<00:02:04.130> yeah<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.369> then<00:02:05.640> to

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
points in Innsbruck yeah and then to

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.290 
points in Innsbruck yeah and then to
make<00:02:06.360> ten<00:02:06.599> points<00:02:06.989> is<00:02:07.110> still<00:02:07.289> a<00:02:07.800> big<00:02:08.459> step<00:02:08.940> at

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
make ten points is still a big step at

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.360 
make ten points is still a big step at
