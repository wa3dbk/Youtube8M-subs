00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
if you've seen the movie gravity part of

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.410 
if you've seen the movie gravity part of
what<00:01:10.070> makes<00:01:10.190> the<00:01:10.310> movie<00:01:10.549> so<00:01:10.700> tense<00:01:10.970> is<00:01:11.210> this

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
what makes the movie so tense is this

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.359 
what makes the movie so tense is this
juxtaposition<00:01:11.750> between<00:01:12.409> the<00:01:12.860> destruction

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
juxtaposition between the destruction

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:14.560 
juxtaposition between the destruction
that's<00:01:13.520> happening<00:01:13.909> in<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.119> outside<00:01:14.150> world

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
that's happening in the outside world

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.570 
that's happening in the outside world
and<00:01:15.020> just<00:01:15.530> hearing<00:01:15.799> Sandra<00:01:16.250> Bullock's

breathing<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:17.299> absence<00:01:17.780> of<00:01:17.900> sound<00:01:18.080> really

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
breathing the absence of sound really

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.080 
breathing the absence of sound really
really<00:01:18.830> adds<00:01:19.070> this<00:01:19.280> layer<00:01:19.490> it<00:01:19.759> makes<00:01:19.970> things

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
really adds this layer it makes things

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.030 
really adds this layer it makes things
really<00:01:20.270> scary<00:01:20.600> dead<00:01:20.990> space<00:01:21.140> builds<00:01:21.590> on<00:01:21.680> top<00:01:21.860> of

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
really scary dead space builds on top of

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.890 
really scary dead space builds on top of
this<00:01:22.159> in<00:01:22.340> a<00:01:22.400> lot<00:01:22.610> of<00:01:22.790> different<00:01:23.150> ways<00:01:23.330> one<00:01:23.869> of

just a fancy way of saying in the world

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.880 
just a fancy way of saying in the world
so<00:01:29.240> in<00:01:29.360> filmmaking<00:01:29.780> for<00:01:30.050> example<00:01:30.409> diegetic

it<00:01:33.320> makes<00:01:33.680> a<00:01:33.799> coupe<00:01:34.040> can<00:01:34.340> crushing<00:01:34.909> noise<00:01:35.090> so

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
it makes a coupe can crushing noise so

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.240 
it makes a coupe can crushing noise so
in<00:01:35.930> dead<00:01:36.200> space<00:01:36.409> one<00:01:36.830> of<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.009> things<00:01:37.190> that

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
in dead space one of the things that

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.130 
in dead space one of the things that
they<00:01:37.399> do<00:01:37.460> is<00:01:37.820> eliminate<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:38.600> separation

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
they do is eliminate the separation

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
value it goes from 0 to 1 so 0 is like a

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
what that beer value is its spatial as

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.540 
what that beer value is its spatial as
well<00:03:00.350> so<00:03:00.680> if<00:03:00.740> there's<00:03:00.920> a<00:03:00.980> really<00:03:01.220> big<00:03:01.370> enemy

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
well so if there's a really big enemy

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.490 
well so if there's a really big enemy
that<00:03:01.820> has<00:03:01.880> a<00:03:01.970> super<00:03:02.360> high<00:03:02.480> fever<00:03:02.750> value<00:03:03.050> and<00:03:03.410> is

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
that has a super high fever value and is

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.590 
that has a super high fever value and is
on<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.650> other<00:03:03.830> side<00:03:03.980> of<00:03:04.370> a<00:03:04.430> wall<00:03:04.600> everything

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
on the other side of a wall everything

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.120 
on the other side of a wall everything
is<00:03:05.720> going<00:03:05.930> to<00:03:06.020> start<00:03:06.230> to<00:03:06.350> build<00:03:06.560> up<00:03:06.830> to<00:03:07.100> that

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
is going to start to build up to that

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.490 
is going to start to build up to that
