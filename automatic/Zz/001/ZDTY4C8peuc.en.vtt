00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
are notoriously unpredictable now why

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.520 
are notoriously unpredictable now why
such<00:01:18.580> a<00:01:18.610> green<00:01:18.970> glow<00:01:19.360> to<00:01:19.510> this<00:01:19.840> thing<00:01:20.020> well<00:01:20.350> the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
such a green glow to this thing well the

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.880 
such a green glow to this thing well the
glow<00:01:20.800> is<00:01:20.830> they<00:01:21.250> think<00:01:21.310> it's<00:01:21.670> caused<00:01:21.970> by<00:01:22.270> a

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
glow is they think it's caused by a

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.000 
glow is they think it's caused by a
cyanogen<00:01:23.890> so<00:01:24.370> it's<00:01:24.520> like<00:01:24.670> cyanic<00:01:25.180> gas<00:01:25.450> and

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
cyanogen so it's like cyanic gas and

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.290 
cyanogen so it's like cyanic gas and
nothing<00:01:27.010> to<00:01:27.130> worry<00:01:27.310> about<00:01:27.400> it<00:01:27.730> doesn't<00:01:28.000> affect

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
this creamy colored star which is not a

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.090 
this creamy colored star which is not a
star<00:01:55.360> in<00:01:55.479> fact<00:01:55.690> it's<00:01:55.870> a<00:01:55.990> planet<00:01:56.260> Saturn<00:01:56.890> and

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
star in fact it's a planet Saturn and

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.070 
star in fact it's a planet Saturn and
this<00:01:57.550> will<00:01:57.729> be<00:01:57.850> on<00:01:57.970> wednesday<00:01:58.540> morning<00:01:58.990> at

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
this will be on wednesday morning at

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.990 
this will be on wednesday morning at
dawn<00:01:59.530> so<00:01:59.920> you<00:01:59.979> look<00:02:00.220> towards<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.820> west

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
dawn so you look towards the west

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.090 
dawn so you look towards the west
basically<00:02:01.870> this<00:02:02.020> time<00:02:02.290> towards<00:02:02.650> the<00:02:02.770> west<00:02:02.890> and

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
basically this time towards the west and

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.469 
basically this time towards the west and
you'll<00:02:03.220> see<00:02:03.370> the<00:02:03.520> full<00:02:03.729> moon<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:04.030> just<00:02:04.210> above

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
you'll see the full moon and just above

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.420 
you'll see the full moon and just above
it<00:02:04.630> it's<00:02:05.049> Saturn<00:02:05.409> if<00:02:05.530> you<00:02:05.620> have<00:02:05.740> a<00:02:05.770> telescope

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
it it's Saturn if you have a telescope

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.109 
it it's Saturn if you have a telescope
you'll<00:02:06.909> notice<00:02:07.330> that<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.720> Rings<00:02:08.259> are<00:02:08.560> almost

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
you'll notice that the Rings are almost

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.360 
you'll notice that the Rings are almost
almost<00:02:10.140> invisible<00:02:11.140> because<00:02:11.470> they're<00:02:11.709> lined

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
almost invisible because they're lined

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.280 
almost invisible because they're lined
up<00:02:12.580> almost<00:02:12.790> exactly<00:02:13.420> towards<00:02:13.810> Earth<00:02:13.959> and<00:02:14.200> this

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
up almost exactly towards Earth and this

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.350 
up almost exactly towards Earth and this
happens<00:02:14.680> almost<00:02:14.860> only<00:02:15.280> about<00:02:15.790> every<00:02:16.120> dozen

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
happens almost only about every dozen

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.270 
happens almost only about every dozen
years<00:02:16.780> 12<00:02:17.080> years<00:02:17.200> or<00:02:17.500> so<00:02:17.680> so<00:02:17.890> it's<00:02:18.040> a<00:02:18.100> pretty

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
years 12 years or so so it's a pretty

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.340 
years 12 years or so so it's a pretty
it's<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.790> pretty<00:02:19.000> nice<00:02:19.209> site<00:02:19.480> in<00:02:19.630> telescope

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
it's a pretty nice site in telescope

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.900 
it's a pretty nice site in telescope
as<00:02:20.440> well<00:02:20.770> but<00:02:21.190> you<00:02:21.280> can<00:02:21.430> see<00:02:21.580> it<00:02:21.670> with<00:02:21.790> the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
as well but you can see it with the

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.150 
as well but you can see it with the
naked<00:02:21.940> eye<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.750> prepare<00:02:23.260> very<00:02:23.530> easily<00:02:23.770> oh

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
naked eye the to prepare very easily oh

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.590 
naked eye the to prepare very easily oh
there's<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.550> only<00:02:24.730> shot<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.090> get<00:02:25.270> within<00:02:25.480> the

there's the only shot to get within the

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.330 
there's the only shot to get within the
next<00:02:25.720> 12<00:02:26.020> years<00:02:26.080> I<00:02:26.410> advise<00:02:26.590> everybody<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:27.070> take

call the father of modern day astronomy

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.990 
call the father of modern day astronomy
Galileo<00:02:37.870> and<00:02:38.140> in<00:02:38.950> time<00:02:39.220> for<00:02:39.490> a<00:02:39.520> year<00:02:39.880> of

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
Galileo and in time for a year of

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.660 
Galileo and in time for a year of
astronomy<00:02:40.240> how's<00:02:40.720> this<00:02:41.020> question<00:02:41.560> here<00:02:41.770> what

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
astronomy how's this question here what

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.390 
astronomy how's this question here what
astronomical<00:02:43.510> discovery<00:02:44.050> did<00:02:44.470> Galileo<00:02:45.070> make

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
astronomical discovery did Galileo make

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.460 
astronomical discovery did Galileo make
could<00:02:45.910> it<00:02:46.000> have<00:02:46.120> been<00:02:46.150> a<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.930> discovery<00:02:47.440> of

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
could it have been a the discovery of

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.230 
could it have been a the discovery of
the<00:02:47.710> moons<00:02:47.920> of<00:02:48.100> Jupiter<00:02:48.550> or<00:02:48.730> how<00:02:49.120> about

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
the moons of Jupiter or how about

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.140 
the moons of Jupiter or how about
sunspots<00:02:49.930> or<00:02:50.410> how<00:02:51.040> about<00:02:51.250> that<00:02:51.490> the<00:02:51.670> Milky<00:02:52.060> Way

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
sunspots or how about that the Milky Way

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.540 
sunspots or how about that the Milky Way
is<00:02:52.180> made<00:02:52.510> of<00:02:52.630> stars<00:02:53.010> there's<00:02:54.010> a<00:02:54.130> couple<00:02:54.310> there

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
is made of stars there's a couple there

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.620 
is made of stars there's a couple there
that<00:02:54.700> could<00:02:54.760> actually<00:02:54.910> fit<00:02:55.300> but<00:02:55.420> I'm<00:02:55.510> not

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
that could actually fit but I'm not

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.000 
that could actually fit but I'm not
exactly<00:02:55.870> sure<00:02:56.020> that's<00:02:56.260> tricky<00:02:56.470> but<00:02:56.830> you<00:02:56.920> know

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
exactly sure that's tricky but you know

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.830

400<00:03:10.180> years<00:03:10.450> since<00:03:10.690> Galileo<00:03:11.230> turned<00:03:11.770> the<00:03:12.280> newly

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
400 years since Galileo turned the newly

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.220 
400 years since Galileo turned the newly
invented<00:03:12.700> telescope<00:03:13.570> towards<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.080> heavens

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
invented telescope towards the heavens

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.500 
invented telescope towards the heavens
Wow<00:03:14.770> and<00:03:15.070> it<00:03:15.250> totally<00:03:15.640> changed<00:03:16.150> our<00:03:16.270> view<00:03:16.300> of

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
Wow and it totally changed our view of

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.240 
Wow and it totally changed our view of
astronomy<00:03:17.050> now<00:03:17.200> we've<00:03:17.620> got<00:03:17.800> some<00:03:18.040> already

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
astronomy now we've got some already

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.100 
astronomy now we've got some already
