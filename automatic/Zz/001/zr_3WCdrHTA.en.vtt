00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
to make this project you are going to

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.990 
to make this project you are going to
need<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.929> simple<00:00:31.470> black<00:00:31.710> t-shirt<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.340> print

need a simple black t-shirt and print

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.180 
need a simple black t-shirt and print
this<00:00:33.120> template<00:00:33.600> from<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.930> description<00:00:34.500> box

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.040 

first<00:00:38.190> start<00:00:38.579> by<00:00:38.790> using<00:00:38.969> an<00:00:39.210> exacto<00:00:39.719> knife<00:00:39.870> to

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
first start by using an exacto knife to

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.930 
first start by using an exacto knife to
cut<00:00:40.320> out<00:00:40.379> only<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.219> petals<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.820> flower

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
cut out only the petals of the flower

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.900 
cut out only the petals of the flower
don't<00:00:42.870> cut<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.260> center<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.070> once

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
don't cut the center of it and once

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.250 
don't cut the center of it and once
you're<00:00:45.059> finished<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.570> should<00:00:45.809> look<00:00:45.870> something

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
you're finished it should look something

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.099 
you're finished it should look something
like<00:00:46.440> this

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:51.109 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.110 

next<00:00:52.109> I'm<00:00:52.260> using<00:00:52.559> yellow<00:00:53.070> acrylic<00:00:53.609> paint<00:00:53.940> and

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
next I'm using yellow acrylic paint and

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.029 
next I'm using yellow acrylic paint and
a<00:00:54.239> round<00:00:54.480> sponge<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.109> create<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.530> center<00:00:55.920> of

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
a round sponge to create the center of

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.310 
a round sponge to create the center of
the<00:00:56.190> flower<00:00:56.429> but<00:00:57.149> first<00:00:57.479> make<00:00:57.750> sure<00:00:57.929> to<00:00:58.050> place

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
the flower but first make sure to place

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.959 
the flower but first make sure to place
a<00:00:58.350> paper<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.190> inside<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.729> shirt

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
a paper on the inside of the shirt

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.729 
a paper on the inside of the shirt
because<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.690> will<00:01:00.870> prevent<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.379> paint<00:01:01.649> from

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
because this will prevent the paint from

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.520 
because this will prevent the paint from
leaking<00:01:02.070> through<00:01:05.689> so<00:01:06.689> for<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.049> first<00:01:07.289> row

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
leaking through so for the first row

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.770 
leaking through so for the first row
make<00:01:07.830> four<00:01:08.130> dots<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.640> since<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.240> want<00:01:09.539> my

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
make four dots and since I want my

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.870 
make four dots and since I want my
flowers<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.380> look<00:01:10.500> closer<00:01:10.860> I'm<00:01:11.250> going<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.759> use

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
flowers to look closer I'm going to use

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.730 
flowers to look closer I'm going to use
the<00:01:12.030> help<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.570> ruler<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.049> make<00:01:13.200> them<00:01:13.439> two

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
the help of the ruler to make them two

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.100 
the help of the ruler to make them two
inches<00:01:14.220> apart

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
inches apart

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.340 
inches apart
and<00:01:16.880> when<00:01:17.880> you're<00:01:18.060> finished<00:01:18.420> just<00:01:18.570> let<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.140> dry

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
and when you're finished just let it dry

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.859 
and when you're finished just let it dry
completely<00:01:19.950> before<00:01:20.280> going<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.789> the<00:01:21.000> next<00:01:21.330> step

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.570 

for<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.990> petals<00:01:25.350> I'm<00:01:25.530> using<00:01:25.830> white<00:01:26.250> acrylic

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
for the petals I'm using white acrylic

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.600 
for the petals I'm using white acrylic
paint<00:01:26.840> first<00:01:27.840> place<00:01:28.440> a<00:01:28.470> stencil<00:01:28.830> over<00:01:29.490> the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
paint first place a stencil over the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.760 
paint first place a stencil over the
dots<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.090> with<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.420> clean<00:01:30.750> sponge<00:01:31.020> paint<00:01:31.530> two

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
dots and with a clean sponge paint two

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.399 
dots and with a clean sponge paint two
layers<00:01:32.039> of<00:01:32.190> this<00:01:32.549> color<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.170> here<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.259> can

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
layers of this color and here you can

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.050 
layers of this color and here you can
see<00:01:34.619> I'm<00:01:34.799> using<00:01:35.009> dabbing<00:01:35.459> motions<00:01:35.850> when<00:01:36.030> I

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
see I'm using dabbing motions when I

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.120 
see I'm using dabbing motions when I
paint<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:37.080> really<00:01:37.319> like<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.740> effect<00:01:38.039> that

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
paint I just really like the effect that

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.510 
paint I just really like the effect that
it<00:01:38.310> creates

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.309 

finally<00:01:42.520> turn<00:01:42.700> a<00:01:42.759> stencil<00:01:43.390> until<00:01:43.899> you<00:01:44.049> see<00:01:44.200> the

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319 
finally turn a stencil until you see the

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.300 
finally turn a stencil until you see the
fabric<00:01:44.530> again<00:01:44.950> and<00:01:45.130> paint<00:01:45.520> two<00:01:45.880> more<00:01:46.240> layers

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
fabric again and paint two more layers

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.130 
fabric again and paint two more layers
and<00:01:48.310> now<00:01:48.850> just<00:01:49.149> keep<00:01:49.390> repeating<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:50.109> same

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
and now just keep repeating the same

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.309 
and now just keep repeating the same
steps<00:01:50.619> I<00:01:50.890> made<00:01:51.310> a<00:01:51.340> total<00:01:51.579> of<00:01:51.819> 16<00:01:52.329> flowers<00:01:52.780> and<00:01:53.020> I

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 
steps I made a total of 16 flowers and I

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:55.649 
steps I made a total of 16 flowers and I
let<00:01:53.530> it<00:01:53.649> dry<00:01:53.920> overnight<00:01:54.399> before<00:01:54.609> hand<00:01:55.240> washing

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
let it dry overnight before hand washing

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:17.210 
let it dry overnight before hand washing
it<00:01:55.780> and<00:01:55.990> then<00:01:56.499> you<00:01:56.740> are<00:01:56.770> done

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:33.620 

I<00:02:18.620> said<00:02:19.620> I'll<00:02:19.860> be<00:02:19.890> she<00:02:20.280> was<00:02:20.550> like<00:02:21.060> this

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.760 

set<00:02:33.990> up<00:02:34.340> like<00:02:35.340> this
