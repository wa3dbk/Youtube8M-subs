very isolated so big concept and popping
everything<00:01:24.020> stops<00:01:24.680> and<00:01:24.950> starts<00:01:25.130> nothing's

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
everything stops and starts nothing's

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.399 
everything stops and starts nothing's
happening<00:01:26.299> at<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.509> same<00:01:26.659> time<00:01:26.720> at<00:01:27.049> least<00:01:27.229> not

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
happening at the same time at least not

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.140

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
circle like this if you can't move in a

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.980 
circle like this if you can't move in a
circle<00:01:36.110> just<00:01:36.409> move<00:01:37.130> it<00:01:37.250> side<00:01:37.430> to<00:01:37.460> side<00:01:37.960> okay

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
circle just move it side to side okay

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.940 
circle just move it side to side okay
