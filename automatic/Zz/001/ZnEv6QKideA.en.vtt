00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.309
 hello today i'm with jules 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.410
 oenologist at home our lives our then 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.719
 to taste a wine in the rules of 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.820
 art as a professional jules is going 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.940
 explain the procedure to follow 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.650
 look good hello you surely have 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.750
 saw sommeliers or oenologists or 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.850
 even your friends who know a little 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.400
 in vain enjoy a few gestures 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.820
 obscure that gives the impression of 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.910
 know 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.769
 to taste a wine is not just to do the 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.110
 smart with his glass and his bottle 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.180
 these few gestures that allow to 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.579
 first feel sylvain faux pas 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.180
 and try to guess if a very 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.190
 good quality 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.680
 and if it is good in wood to taste a 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.230
 wine there are not 36 solutions there are 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.899
 a single, very basic method that 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.700
 actually looks like the natural gestures of 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.329
 wine consumption first of all 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:58.170
 take 20 years to hand we look at it 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.000
 we taste it we spit where it is 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.320
 sees according to where we are 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.239
 and give a judgment 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.519
 I'm going to go back now to each 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.080
 step and try to tell you what we 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.240
 try to guess and what to do 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.909
 and what not to do to taste a wine 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.520
 need a wineglass a glass that puts 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.299
 value the wine in general these are 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.270
 tulip shaped stemware is 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.979
 big enough to be able to elven not 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.180
 too much they have to be practical but 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.430
 a relatively comfortable size 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.930
 to allow a pleasant tasting 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.640
 think that glass has to put in 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.450
 value the wine how to hold his glass 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.130
 for well tasted never by the chalice 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.840
 it's not cognac 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.880
 what are we going to do by putting in 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.829
 his hand the first thing green we're going 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.630
 make fingerprints on the chalice 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.600
 at the end of the meal you will have a drink 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.610
 hymn to greasy secondly you 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.170
 warm your wine the wine must be at 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.909
 room temperature if you put in the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.850
 warmth of your hand you're just doing 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.810
 caby but potentially dark on 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.979
 so hold the green by his foot 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:04.680
 either by his leg what is the sight of 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.090
 have a first glimpse of the wine they say 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.429
 we will analyze the wine's dress 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.490
 its color like the horses they have a 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.800
 dress 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.920
 to watch a wine you never put in 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.770
 height to keep the wine we take it 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.020
 naturally and we bow to ourselves 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:25.130
 outward about 45 degrees 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.500
 to have a direct view through the 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.510
 wine surface we always look on 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.890
 a white background why because these 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.240
 most neutral fund that will us 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.740
 allow to observe the true 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.690
 wine color if I look on a background 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.070
 colorful I will see through the colors 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.090
 from the bottom and I will not see the color anymore 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:43.010
 wind at a glance we will try 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.630
 to estimate its intensity 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.540
 is it dark or is it 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.370
 is clear and his age is what he is 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.150
 rather purple or is it rather 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.830
 orange and if it's clear it's a wine 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.830
 light if it is dark 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:01.190
 it is a dense wine tannic beefy if 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.810
 the purplish in general points 20 road 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.570
 it's a sign of youth so it's going to be 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.610
 on the fruit rather on notes of 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.900
 freshness on the contrary if it is rather 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.240
 orange and in the case of a red wine 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.010
 he's going to be old and so we're going to have some 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.700
 different smells of fruit smells 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.650
 to the other life wild leather odors 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.850
 perfumes a little different finally on 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.860
 whites as on reds 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.840
 you can circulate the wine on 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.090
 along the walls and observe the drops 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.310
 who fall we talk about the tears of 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.810
 legs it's not at all a site of 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.760
 quality 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.840
 it illustrates the alcoholic richness of the wine 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.580
 the more tears you have 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.050
 the more your wine is going to be alcoholic for 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:41.240
 the more he will be powerful as a butcher 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:44.450
 fill the mouth and we stop there for 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.310
 the view now let's go two noses 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.900
 things for the nose let's go first 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.490
 tried to detect if there is a fault in 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.670
 the most common wine is the taste of 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.890
 cap to detect the taste of cork 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.360
 it's very simple pours you wine in 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.320
 the glass you wear it to your nose 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:04.060
 after watching him sing beautifully if a 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.930
 default, do not bother to feel it 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.720
 if you are at the restaurant you 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.760
 refuse if you are at home 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.250
 take another bottle if you 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.350
 detect no defects but a perfume 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.950
 nice you will be able to analyze it 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:21.229
 a little more to do this we stir up the 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.870
 wine in the glass makes us turn the 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:27.699
 wine in the green with a small 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:29.800
 wrist movements by doing that one 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:31.180
 increases the evaporation of odors and 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.310
 so by putting his nose over the 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.760
 glass after dropping it we got 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.960
 more richer denser perfumes 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.460
 if he was good it's even more 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.870
 friendly that's why we do not 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.130
 if we felt a fault what we will have 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.210
 just full of bad smells whose 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:56.740
 to taste it 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:58.810
 my door to his lips I explain what 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.100
 the facts I took a sip of the 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.320
 dwarf I do not need to take any 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.630
 enormously I make them turn in more 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.949
 of palate so that it touches the tongue 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:10.780
 the gums the days for really 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:12.430
 to feel the texture of the wine does it 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.410
 is pleasant to the touch in fact 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.850
 is it sweet is talking about 20 be 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.070
 eyes when he is very sweet remembers is 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.840
 a little old it is quite silky is it 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.280
 that it's biting acid they would burn 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.800
 some language or is it 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.479
 very dry in young people a bit gruff and there 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.169
 it would dry you a little play it the 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:28.750
 gums 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.169
 I also suck a little air with 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.419
 my mouth 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:34.479
 so why do we do that we do that in 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:36.700
 tasting he does not do that at table 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:39.460
 serves to feel the arts or in the mouth 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.440
 you have no aroma you feel that the 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.770
 wine structure is acidic taste 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.530
 sweet panic it's a little taste 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.780
 biting but you can not feel 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.539
 the smells of wine these smells and get 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.220
 feel high level the nasal cavity and 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:55.150
 bread to smell its smells so it takes 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.340
 bring air into your mouth 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.960
 it is to circulate in its cavity 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.580
 nasal and bring out by the ine 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.010
 that's why a sommeliers 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.360
 oenologists or a wine lover aspires 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:07.330
 a little air when he has wine in his mouth 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:10.449
 he says who sings flute or who does 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.460
 the retro-olfaction finally I spit the 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:14.349
 wine why not what I did gus 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.050
 in a professional setting and that 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:19.840
 alcohol weakened the senses 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.520
 obviously at the restaurant or at home 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.870
 do not spit and if you have to taste 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.760
 several wines for example during a 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.800
 salon is better spit we do not lose 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.500
 at all the pleasure of wine since 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.500
 put his mouth in the throat 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.240
 we have no sensation and keep 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.220
 the clear mind to be able to savor 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.570
 the enclosure of the wines we are going to taste 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.460
 the chain along a day of 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.980
 tasting for example in conclusion 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.450
 you see that tasting a wine is 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.130
 quite simple there is no need for 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:47.350
 to do a whole bazaar is gestures 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.750
 very natural and it just serves to try 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:52.710
 to appreciate the product to see if there is 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.710
 a fault is to see if we like
