00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.319
 hi i'm a princess today we are again 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.320
 let's talk about the phantom head this time too 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.790
 I have friends for you 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.299
 irrefutable proof that 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.230
 inscription phantom head refers exactly 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.230
 to mango 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.900
 and now friends must put 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.019
 likes if you want to see more videos by 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.890
 this game and let's start know what already 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.140
 led 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.240
 some evidence that was 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.669
 based only on my guesswork 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.579
 here as some of you are friends all 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.469
 did not believe that the inscription head phantom 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.899
 it belongs to mangle 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.340
 so right now with the help 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.780
 special program 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.239
 I will prove to you that the inscription head phantom 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.030
 It refers specifically to manga as you can see 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.390
 specifically to prove to you that my 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.520
 theories are the most truthful found 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.219
 the same program with which were 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.770
 screenshots are made and if you run this 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.280
 game and this program at the same time 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.650
 the program will read all files 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.510
 being in a real time game if 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.979
 be the game menu and make in 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.920
 the program search by inscription 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.409
 on the head but the program gives only 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.180
 one result and here we see this 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.420
 file in the game archive 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.360
 However, if you abandon this game and after 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.240
 scan this again then we 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.100
 we will get two results and just 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.110
 the second result is visible only during 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.720
 games since the program is real 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.880
 of time they absorb all the files that 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.090
 may appear in the office or on 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.909
 video camera now as you can see the files 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.189
 real-time symbols change and in 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.979
 the moment each character changes they 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.570
 highlighted in red it means 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.850
 that all files 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.670
 may appear in the game but real 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.670
 moment is waiting now 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.360
 I will explain with a simple example how do you know 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.760
 the game has Easter eggs and if the poster in 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.350
 office click on a but among and we will hear 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.990
 sound in the program 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.470
 this easter egg signed box with hong and 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:14.780
 Now watch carefully what will happen in 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.780
 This program if you click on the nose Freddie 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.709
 as you can see at that moment when in the game 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.360
 sound is played alongside this 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.180
 inscription 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.900
 the symbols start flashing it means that 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.780
 the inscription nose kong is responsible for this 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.910
 Easter eggs I hope you understand how it is 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.790
 works but for more accurate and 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.250
 clear example let's look at 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.459
 puppet mask the moment she appears in 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.550
 office and as it turned out friends mask 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:53.459
 the puppets in the game are signed as force from 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.680
 puppet train scrimer puppet 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.440
 also next to the puppet scrimer 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.560
 there is an inscription for garden golden Freddy 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.410
 that is, the golden rider freddie srimer therefore 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.769
 friends look carefully and so are we 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.470
 we will see him too as soon as a puppet 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.570
 It appears on the camcorder the next 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.209
 starts to glow several at once 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.030
 characters and there is a switch to the room 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.640
 with a puppet, she will immediately appear in the office 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.970
 starting extra and give 5 more 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.700
 characters it means that the label is forced 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.720
 puppet and refers specifically to the puppet 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.540
 in the office 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.709
 And when the screamer Kalgan Fredy appears 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.840
 then next to him 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.750
 start some set 7 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.750
 who also say that this 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.629
 inscription for garden golden freddy refers 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.540
 exactly k is not small for a detailed example 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:49.019
 took screenshots so you can see well 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:53.610
 what characters are active after 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:56.220
 the appearance of the puppet also look at 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.580
 screenshots before and after phantom 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.480
 freddie most likely is active here so 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.440
 many characters 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:07.290
 because his screamer has animation 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.780
 more than 15 frames in general, I hope 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.560
 that you understand how it works 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.000
 and now the most interesting my friends are we 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.359
 look at the inscription 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.070
 then at least once and for all 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.520
 make sure that the head of the phantom 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.160
 It is head brazier as 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.130
 see friends next to the inscription 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.220
 phantomhive lit up several 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.210
 characters it means that the manga appeared 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:38.220
 on camcorder 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:40.200
 and now we all learn see how 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.900
 only the mandala head appeared behind 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.360
 glass next to the inscription immediately 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.520
 four additional schemes appeared 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.460
 and they appeared only at that moment 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.660
 when mangle head play to start 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.200
 publish your amount 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.599
 also as you see now in the office 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:01.440
 there is only a mangle head and no 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:03.810
 the other stakes are not here and as soon as 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.139
 head brazier from among but immediately 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.900
 stopped flashing four additional 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:13.200
 characters that showed her appearance 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.720
 in the office and for sure 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:19.229
 look back and forth 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.449
 the appearance of the mangle in the office see the difference a 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:24.449
 it means friends 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:27.120
 was originally right somehow said that 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:30.319
 phantom move is my head angel therefore 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.999
 friends you just do it yourself 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:36.449
 made sure that the brazier in the office 

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:38.569
 is a phantom and hope you are now 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:41.969
 made sure as my evidence 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:43.650
 truthfully hope it was more than 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:46.430
 convincingly my friends 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.809
 so believe only true theories
