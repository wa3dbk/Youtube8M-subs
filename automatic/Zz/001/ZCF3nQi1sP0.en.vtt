Babcock puts you on that I mean the same
line<00:02:35.000> I<00:02:35.030> mean<00:02:35.240> we'll<00:02:35.600> see<00:02:35.750> how<00:02:35.870> he<00:02:35.930> does<00:02:36.170> it<00:02:36.320> and

line I mean we'll see how he does it and

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.810 
line I mean we'll see how he does it and
the<00:02:36.500> skill<00:02:36.710> sets<00:02:36.980> have<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.280> mesh<00:02:37.460> but<00:02:37.640> if<00:02:37.730> it

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
the skill sets have to mesh but if it

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.550 
the skill sets have to mesh but if it
makes<00:02:38.030> sense<00:02:38.120> wouldn't<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:38.660> with<00:02:39.050> you<00:02:39.320> and

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
makes sense wouldn't it with you and

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.530 
makes sense wouldn't it with you and
Danny<00:02:39.800> and<00:02:40.070> Patty<00:02:40.670> all<00:02:40.880> play<00:02:41.120> on<00:02:41.240> the<00:02:41.330> same

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
Danny and Patty all play on the same

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.350 
Danny and Patty all play on the same
line<00:02:41.780> in<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:41.960> Olympic<00:02:42.290> Games<00:02:42.470> I<00:02:43.180> think<00:02:44.180> so<00:02:44.330> I

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
line in the Olympic Games I think so I

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.060 
line in the Olympic Games I think so I
think<00:02:44.600> that's<00:02:44.750> probably<00:02:45.620> what<00:02:45.890> they<00:02:45.980> have

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
think that's probably what they have

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.410 
think that's probably what they have
penciled<00:02:46.490> in<00:02:46.550> right<00:02:46.700> now<00:02:46.850> just<00:02:47.030> because<00:02:47.240> we're

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
penciled in right now just because we're

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.090 
penciled in right now just because we're
already<00:02:47.810> gonna<00:02:47.990> be<00:02:48.080> pretty<00:02:48.680> familiar<00:02:48.830> with

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
already gonna be pretty familiar with

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.720 
already gonna be pretty familiar with
each<00:02:49.370> other

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
each other

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.130 
each other
we've<00:02:50.180> been<00:02:50.270> playing<00:02:50.480> pretty<00:02:50.720> well<00:02:50.810> with<00:02:51.050> each

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
we've been playing pretty well with each

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.100 
we've been playing pretty well with each
other<00:02:51.290> as<00:02:51.500> well<00:02:51.650> so<00:02:51.980> who<00:02:52.850> knows<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.750> know<00:02:53.870> what

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
other as well so who knows you know what

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.620 
other as well so who knows you know what
what<00:02:54.350> Babs<00:02:54.560> has<00:02:54.800> in<00:02:55.010> store<00:02:55.250> but<00:02:55.550> I<00:02:55.760> assume<00:02:56.600> that

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
what Babs has in store but I assume that

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.030 
what Babs has in store but I assume that
we're<00:02:56.900> probably<00:02:57.050> all<00:02:57.320> three<00:02:57.500> gonna<00:02:57.740> start<00:02:57.980> on

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
we're probably all three gonna start on

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.320 
we're probably all three gonna start on
the<00:02:58.130> same<00:02:58.280> line<00:02:58.490> for<00:02:58.670> sure<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:59.120> haven't

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
the same line for sure you haven't

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.030 
the same line for sure you haven't
spoken<00:02:59.570> to<00:02:59.750> him<00:02:59.990> or<00:03:00.140> Stevie<00:03:00.470> why<00:03:00.620> about<00:03:00.890> how

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
spoken to him or Stevie why about how

back then when you went both of those
awards<00:03:40.600> yeah<00:03:41.600> I<00:03:41.630> think<00:03:41.720> so<00:03:42.050> I<00:03:42.080> think<00:03:42.140> it's<00:03:42.440> very

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
awards yeah I think so I think it's very

awards yeah I think so I think it's very
similar<00:03:42.890> I<00:03:43.040> think<00:03:43.370> with<00:03:44.120> the<00:03:44.240> acquisition<00:03:44.480> of

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
similar I think with the acquisition of

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.950 
similar I think with the acquisition of
Danny<00:03:45.430> for<00:03:46.430> life<00:03:46.640> as<00:03:46.820> a<00:03:46.850> passer<00:03:47.420> I<00:03:47.480> like<00:03:47.840> to

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:47.960 
Danny for life as a passer I like to

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.690 
Danny for life as a passer I like to
pass<00:03:48.140> the<00:03:48.350> puck<00:03:48.530> and<00:03:48.740> have<00:03:48.950> Patty<00:03:49.220> and<00:03:49.340> Danny

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
pass the puck and have Patty and Danny

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.210 
pass the puck and have Patty and Danny
on<00:03:49.880> my<00:03:50.000> line<00:03:50.180> it's<00:03:50.360> it's<00:03:51.020> pretty<00:03:51.260> pretty<00:03:52.010> easy

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
on my line it's it's pretty pretty easy

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.620 
on my line it's it's pretty pretty easy
for<00:03:52.490> me<00:03:52.670> out<00:03:52.760> there<00:03:52.910> to<00:03:53.000> be<00:03:53.090> honest<00:03:53.330> with<00:03:53.480> you

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
for me out there to be honest with you

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:54.910 
for me out there to be honest with you
and<00:03:53.690> I<00:03:53.750> think<00:03:53.960> in<00:03:54.080> that<00:03:54.110> season<00:03:54.500> where<00:03:54.710> we<00:03:54.770> won

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
and I think in that season where we won

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.040 
and I think in that season where we won
those<00:03:55.160> awards<00:03:55.670> I<00:03:55.880> achieved<00:03:56.540> so<00:03:56.690> it<00:03:56.750> was<00:03:56.840> very

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
those awards I achieved so it was very

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.090 
those awards I achieved so it was very
very<00:03:57.200> hot<00:03:57.470> you<00:03:57.590> score<00:03:57.860> 56<00:03:58.370> goals<00:03:58.520> that<00:03:58.850> year<00:03:59.090> so

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
very hot you score 56 goals that year so

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.980 
very hot you score 56 goals that year so
for<00:04:01.100> me<00:04:01.550> it's<00:04:01.760> I'm<00:04:02.090> having<00:04:02.660> a<00:04:02.720> good<00:04:02.840> year

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
for me it's I'm having a good year

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.780 
for me it's I'm having a good year
probably<00:04:03.380> as<00:04:03.860> good<00:04:04.010> as<00:04:04.160> that<00:04:04.310> year<00:04:04.580> and

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
probably as good as that year and

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.790 
probably as good as that year and

Ovechkin is a guy that I just marvel at
his<00:04:12.560> tenacity<00:04:13.100> I've<00:04:13.250> never<00:04:13.430> seen<00:04:13.640> a<00:04:13.670> player<00:04:14.120> as

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
his tenacity I've never seen a player as

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.449 
his tenacity I've never seen a player as
skilled<00:04:14.570> as<00:04:14.720> he<00:04:14.930> is<00:04:15.080> so<00:04:15.800> tough<00:04:16.070> it's<00:04:16.370> so

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
skilled as he is so tough it's so

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.280 
skilled as he is so tough it's so
willing<00:04:16.730> to<00:04:16.760> mix<00:04:17.030> it<00:04:17.150> up<00:04:17.239> and<00:04:17.450> you<00:04:17.690> guys<00:04:17.840> ramped

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
willing to mix it up and you guys ramped

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.659 
willing to mix it up and you guys ramped
it<00:04:18.440> up<00:04:18.530> a<00:04:18.680> little<00:04:18.770> bit<00:04:19.010> extra<00:04:19.220> going<00:04:19.520> up

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
it up a little bit extra going up

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.039 
it up a little bit extra going up
against<00:04:19.940> the<00:04:20.060> player<00:04:20.239> of<00:04:20.419> his<00:04:20.510> caliber<00:04:20.570> Joe

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
against the player of his caliber Joe

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.950 
against the player of his caliber Joe
well<00:04:22.560> I<00:04:22.590> think<00:04:22.830> I<00:04:23.280> think<00:04:23.639> when<00:04:24.479> you<00:04:24.599> play<00:04:24.780> the

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
well I think I think when you play the

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.300 
well I think I think when you play the
better<00:04:25.080> teams<00:04:25.379> you<00:04:25.590> get<00:04:25.710> amped<00:04:26.009> up<00:04:26.099> and

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
better teams you get amped up and

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.830 
better teams you get amped up and
specially<00:04:26.759> Alex<00:04:27.150> is<00:04:27.240> probably<00:04:27.569> the<00:04:27.660> best

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
specially Alex is probably the best

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.779 
specially Alex is probably the best
player<00:04:28.080> in<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.229> world<00:04:28.289> right<00:04:28.620> now<00:04:28.770> so<00:04:29.069> I<00:04:29.340> think
