what I imagined my pirate cigar that's a
lot<00:00:21.000> like<00:00:21.500> brightly<00:00:22.500> coloured<00:00:23.600> definitely

I<00:00:27.750> got<00:00:28.349> say<00:00:28.529> this<00:00:29.220> one<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.730> didn't<00:00:30.240> think<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.599> was

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
I got say this one I didn't think I was

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.470 
I got say this one I didn't think I was
gonna<00:00:30.869> do<00:00:31.080> very<00:00:31.230> well<00:00:31.349> in<00:00:31.650> in<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.009> match<00:00:32.480> after

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
gonna do very well in in the match after

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.229 
gonna do very well in in the match after
looking<00:00:33.750> at<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.760> cicadas<00:00:35.760> basic

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
looking at the to a cicadas basic

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.540 
looking at the to a cicadas basic
loadout<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:37.350> medium<00:00:37.649> lasers<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.190> small

loadout of to medium lasers in a small

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.270 
loadout of to medium lasers in a small
yeah<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.719> suddenly<00:00:40.379> realized<00:00:40.680> why<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.160> was

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
yeah I suddenly realized why I was

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.690 
yeah I suddenly realized why I was
running

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
running

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.520 
running
previously<00:00:42.360> six<00:00:42.660> mediums<00:00:43.050> on<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.350> thing

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
previously six mediums on this thing

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.330 
previously six mediums on this thing
it's<00:00:43.680> been<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.860> while<00:00:44.129> since<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.579> ran<00:00:44.760> an<00:00:44.910> sacada

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
it's been a while since I ran an sacada

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.970 
it's been a while since I ran an sacada
so<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.789> shook<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.360> few<00:00:48.510> liberties<00:00:48.660> obviously<00:00:49.500> you

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
so I shook a few liberties obviously you

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.799 
so I shook a few liberties obviously you
have<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.190> put<00:00:50.399> an<00:00:50.460> XL<00:00:50.730> engine<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.210> saccade<00:00:51.539> it

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
have to put an XL engine in a saccade it

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.490 
have to put an XL engine in a saccade it
can't<00:00:52.050> live<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.770> standard<00:00:54.050> so<00:00:55.050> I'm<00:00:55.350> with

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
can't live of a standard so I'm with

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.139 
can't live of a standard so I'm with
endow<00:00:55.770> steel<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.129> team<00:00:56.340> mostly<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:56.910> what<00:00:57.120> I

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
endow steel this team mostly so what I

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.389 
endow steel this team mostly so what I
ended<00:00:57.360> up<00:00:57.449> doing<00:00:57.629> was<00:00:57.780> basically<00:00:58.680> upgrading

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
ended up doing was basically upgrading

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.880 
ended up doing was basically upgrading
the<00:00:59.520> mediums<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.660> pulses<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.350> small<00:01:01.710> to

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
the mediums to pulses and small to

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.100 
the mediums to pulses and small to
apples<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.030> stripped<00:01:03.329> off<00:01:03.510> three<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:03.960> a

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
apples and I stripped off three of a

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.710 
apples and I stripped off three of a
medium<00:01:04.409> lasers<00:01:05.210> essentially<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.420> makes<00:01:06.600> this

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
medium lasers essentially it makes this

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.170 
medium lasers essentially it makes this
Mac<00:01:06.990> heat<00:01:07.650> neutral<00:01:08.040> with<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.939> remaining

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
Mac heat neutral with the remaining

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.140 
Mac heat neutral with the remaining
space<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.689> stuck<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:10.080> an<00:01:10.500> AMS<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.400> half<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.970> ton

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
space I stuck on an AMS and half a ton

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.480 
space I stuck on an AMS and half a ton
of<00:01:12.180> ammo<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.869> have<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> paltry<00:01:13.650> 500<00:01:14.189> AMS

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
of ammo so I have a paltry 500 AMS

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.330 
of ammo so I have a paltry 500 AMS
rounds<00:01:14.880> which<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.650> don't<00:01:16.650> even<00:01:16.740> think<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.159> was<00:01:17.189> a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
rounds which I don't even think it was a

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.749 
rounds which I don't even think it was a
quarter<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.939> match<00:01:18.200> lrm<00:01:19.200> fire<00:01:19.380> going<00:01:19.650> on

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
quarter of the match lrm fire going on

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.140 
quarter of the match lrm fire going on
but<00:01:20.780> yeah<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.140> sakata<00:01:22.650> as<00:01:23.070> itself<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.759> does

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
but yeah the sakata as itself it does

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.280 
but yeah the sakata as itself it does
often<00:01:24.840> get<00:01:25.680> mistaken<00:01:26.340> for<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.850> light<00:01:27.030> Mac

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
often get mistaken for a light Mac

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.510 
often get mistaken for a light Mac
probably<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.470> few<00:01:28.500> things<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.009> sits<00:01:29.220> in<00:01:29.369> that

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
probably in a few things it sits in that

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.870 
probably in a few things it sits in that
sort<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.880> awkward<00:01:30.119> position<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.900> being<00:01:31.880> an

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
sort of awkward position of being an

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.569 
sort of awkward position of being an
extremely<00:01:33.509> light<00:01:33.840> medium<00:01:34.259> but<00:01:34.770> for<00:01:35.400> some

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
extremely light medium but for some

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.120 
extremely light medium but for some
players<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:36.240> very<00:01:36.570> heavy<00:01:36.840> light<00:01:37.229> if<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.979> makes

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
players a very heavy light if that makes

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.520 
players a very heavy light if that makes
sense<00:01:38.189> now<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:39.750> number<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.110> times<00:01:40.290> I've<00:01:40.439> had

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
sense now the number of times I've had

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.350 
sense now the number of times I've had
to<00:01:40.770> sort<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.100> say<00:01:41.369> no<00:01:41.520> no<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.939> cicadas<00:01:42.210> are

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
to sort of say no no the cicadas are

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.660 
to sort of say no no the cicadas are
medium<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:43.880> well<00:01:44.880> forget<00:01:45.590> to<00:01:46.590> do<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.829> but<00:01:47.490> yeah

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
medium is well forget to do it but yeah

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.249 
medium is well forget to do it but yeah
the<00:01:47.880> faulty<00:01:48.210> tone<00:01:48.360> category<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.899> not<00:01:49.020> really

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
the faulty tone category is not really

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.649 
the faulty tone category is not really
bringing<00:01:49.619> much<00:01:49.860> else<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.670> table<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.270> but

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
bringing much else to the table it but

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.359 
bringing much else to the table it but
it<00:01:51.810> does<00:01:51.990> mount<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.320> bigger<00:01:52.530> engine<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.220> it's

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
it does mount a bigger engine and it's

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.889 
it does mount a bigger engine and it's
got<00:01:53.549> slightly<00:01:54.210> better<00:01:54.390> survivability

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
got slightly better survivability

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
first thing you target when you start

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.290 
first thing you target when you start
firing<00:03:57.060> out<00:03:57.300> and<00:03:57.980> do<00:03:58.980> you<00:03:59.220> know<00:03:59.340> although<00:04:00.120> it's

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
firing out and do you know although it's

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.360 
firing out and do you know although it's
not<00:04:00.510> a<00:04:00.570> minute<00:04:00.930> but<00:04:01.230> it<00:04:01.320> is<00:04:01.440> still<00:04:01.710> 40<00:04:02.130> tons

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
not a minute but it is still 40 tons

it's<00:04:02.700> not<00:04:02.850> surviving<00:04:03.690> a<00:04:03.750> hell<00:04:03.870> of<00:04:03.900> a<00:04:04.080> lot<00:04:06.740> they

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
it's not surviving a hell of a lot they

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.500 
it's not surviving a hell of a lot they
basically<00:04:07.950> kill<00:04:08.430> steal<00:04:08.670> but<00:04:08.940> kills<00:04:09.540> it<00:04:09.690> you

standing<00:05:00.940> still<00:05:01.320> you<00:05:02.320> mainly<00:05:02.560> have<00:05:03.090> hoping

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
standing still you mainly have hoping

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.290 
standing still you mainly have hoping
you<00:05:04.240> get<00:05:04.390> a<00:05:04.420> lucky<00:05:04.660> shot<00:05:05.670> it's<00:05:06.670> so<00:05:06.850> on<00:05:07.000> the<00:05:07.120> same

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
you get a lucky shot it's so on the same

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.940 
you get a lucky shot it's so on the same
line<00:05:07.480> as<00:05:07.660> the<00:05:07.750> spider<00:05:08.080> where<00:05:08.440> the<00:05:08.530> spiders

line as the spider where the spiders
life<00:05:09.100> to<00:05:09.220> right<00:05:09.370> so<00:05:09.550> those<00:05:09.760> are<00:05:09.940> pretty<00:05:10.390> pretty
