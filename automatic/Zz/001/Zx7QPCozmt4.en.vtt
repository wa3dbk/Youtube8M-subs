 make some prawns with salt and to 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.280
 that first let's prepare a tray 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.379
 with a bed of fat salt that we have 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.070
 moistened but attention with water 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:44.590
 mineral because if we put it on the tap 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.230
 we run the risk it takes chlorine that 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.330
 communicate that flavor to bleach to 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.489

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.620
 moisten the fat salt with mineral water 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.960

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.989
 over and you have seen how we have 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.390
 totally covered the prawns with 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.010
 Fat salt also moistened that tray 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.740

 We are stinging it with fine dice in 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.700
 that little crystal bowl we now chop 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.620
 also the chives remember that the 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.570
 chive never be repeated or is it just 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.400
 it happens once 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.350

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.659
