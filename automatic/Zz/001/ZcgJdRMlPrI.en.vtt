all right so basically you can reach

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.170 
all right so basically you can reach
your<00:02:09.750> sheepies<00:02:10.200> from<00:02:10.770> further<00:02:11.039> away<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.700> once

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
your sheepies from further away and once

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.640 
your sheepies from further away and once
you<00:02:12.330> do<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.840> can<00:02:12.990> actually<00:02:13.140> receive

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
you do that you can actually receive

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.580 
you do that you can actually receive
more<00:02:14.310> wool<00:02:14.580> than<00:02:15.030> normal<00:02:15.450> on<00:02:15.660> average<00:02:16.380> you'll

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
more wool than normal on average you'll

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
a little bit longer so that's kind of

a little bit longer so that's kind of
nice<00:02:27.660> now<00:02:28.350> of<00:02:28.440> course<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.739> next<00:02:28.920> is<00:02:29.160> the

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
nice now of course the next is the

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.729 
nice now of course the next is the
extended<00:02:29.940> compass<00:02:30.450> this<00:02:30.720> is<00:02:30.900> actually<00:02:31.260> cool

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
extended compass this is actually cool

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.949 
extended compass this is actually cool
concept<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.489> is<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.910> little<00:02:33.300> bit<00:02:33.480> interesting

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
concept that is a little bit interesting

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.830 
concept that is a little bit interesting
it's<00:02:34.380> almost<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.830> waypoint<00:02:35.069> like<00:02:35.819> compass<00:02:36.600> now

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
it's almost a waypoint like compass now

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.270 
it's almost a waypoint like compass now
of<00:02:36.989> course<00:02:37.200> you<00:02:37.260> can<00:02:37.410> have<00:02:37.470> five<00:02:37.800> directions

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
of course you can have five directions

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.370 
of course you can have five directions
though<00:02:38.700> like<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.150> fav<00:02:39.330> loop<00:02:39.600> come<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.230> see

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
though like the fav loop come to see

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.470 
though like the fav loop come to see
arrow<00:02:40.680> thingies<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.940> way<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.269> get

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
arrow thingies and the way that you get

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.710 
arrow thingies and the way that you get
those<00:02:42.720> is<00:02:42.959> by<00:02:43.230> placing<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.739> sign<00:02:43.980> naming<00:02:44.850> it<00:02:44.970> did

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
those is by placing a sign naming it did

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.320 
those is by placing a sign naming it did
this<00:02:45.900> kid<00:02:46.230> do<00:02:46.500> yeah<00:02:47.130> that's<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.400> great<00:02:47.640> name<00:02:47.820> now

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.660 
this kid do yeah that's a great name now
of<00:02:48.480> course<00:02:48.630> you<00:02:48.959> can<00:02:49.260> also<00:02:49.410> assign<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.400> color

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
of course you can also assign it a color

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.860 
of course you can also assign it a color
I'm<00:02:50.880> gonna<00:02:51.060> go<00:02:51.180> ahead<00:02:51.269> and<00:02:51.450> give<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.600> blue

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870

generally you can do all of the colors
of<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.120> wool<00:02:54.390> rainbow<00:02:55.050> that<00:02:55.709> should<00:02:55.890> be<00:02:55.980> a

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
of the wool rainbow that should be a

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.740 
of the wool rainbow that should be a
thing<00:02:56.070> now<00:02:56.820> of<00:02:56.940> course<00:02:57.120> once<00:02:57.420> you've<00:02:57.570> done

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
thing now of course once you've done

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.320 
thing now of course once you've done
this<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:58.110> will<00:02:58.290> actually<00:02:58.470> point<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.880> sign

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
this it will actually point to the sign

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.880 
this it will actually point to the sign
as<00:03:00.570> well<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:01.080> think<00:03:02.300> there<00:03:03.300> we<00:03:03.420> go<00:03:03.600> very<00:03:04.019> easy

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
as well I think there we go very easy

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.680 
as well I think there we go very easy
boom<00:03:05.370> it's<00:03:05.640> like<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.819> temperature<00:03:06.480> gauge

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
boom it's like a temperature gauge

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.289 
boom it's like a temperature gauge
except<00:03:07.230> this<00:03:08.130> would<00:03:08.310> be<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.459> horrible<00:03:08.910> horrible

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
except this would be a horrible horrible

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.720 
except this would be a horrible horrible
way<00:03:09.540> of<00:03:09.690> measuring<00:03:09.870> temperature<00:03:10.470> all<00:03:11.459> right

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
way of measuring temperature all right

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.729 
way of measuring temperature all right
now<00:03:11.880> until<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.269> next<00:03:12.390> one<00:03:12.630> is<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.110> extended

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
now until the next one is the extended

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.220 
now until the next one is the extended
diamond<00:03:14.400> sword<00:03:14.790> this<00:03:15.390> is<00:03:15.630> going<00:03:16.049> to<00:03:16.140> do

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
diamond sword this is going to do

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.020 
diamond sword this is going to do
exactly<00:03:16.440> what<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.310> think<00:03:17.459> it<00:03:17.610> is<00:03:17.640> it's<00:03:17.910> kind

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
exactly what you think it is it's kind

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.789 
exactly what you think it is it's kind
of<00:03:18.060> last<00:03:18.299> longer<00:03:18.660> it's<00:03:18.870> gonna<00:03:18.959> do<00:03:19.230> more<00:03:19.380> damage

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
of last longer it's gonna do more damage

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.580 
of last longer it's gonna do more damage
and<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:20.010> can<00:03:20.160> hit<00:03:20.810> enemies<00:03:21.810> from<00:03:22.350> further

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
and you can hit enemies from further

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.900 
and you can hit enemies from further
away<00:03:22.829> I<00:03:23.010> don't<00:03:23.190> know<00:03:23.250> why<00:03:23.400> it<00:03:23.459> was<00:03:23.549> so<00:03:23.670> hard<00:03:23.850> to

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
away I don't know why it was so hard to

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.850 
away I don't know why it was so hard to
say<00:03:24.000> enemies<00:03:24.450> I<00:03:24.630> don't<00:03:25.140> need<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.290> get<00:03:25.440> as<00:03:25.709> you

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
say enemies I don't need to get as you

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.710 
say enemies I don't need to get as you
can<00:03:25.980> see<00:03:26.100> he<00:03:26.549> can<00:03:26.670> just<00:03:26.790> slaughter<00:03:27.269> piggies

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
can see he can just slaughter piggies

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.100 
can see he can just slaughter piggies
you're<00:03:28.410> just<00:03:28.650> you<00:03:28.860> just<00:03:29.040> basically<00:03:29.549> the<00:03:30.110> HAMB

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
you're just you just basically the HAMB

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.380 
you're just you just basically the HAMB
HAMB<00:03:31.560> monster<00:03:32.430> you're<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.790> hand<00:03:32.970> monster

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
HAMB monster you're the hand monster

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.600 
HAMB monster you're the hand monster
that's<00:03:33.660> it<00:03:33.810> that's<00:03:34.079> his<00:03:34.260> thing<00:03:34.470> too<00:03:34.739> I<00:03:34.980> think<00:03:35.430> I

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
that's it that's his thing too I think I

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.479 
that's it that's his thing too I think I
actually<00:03:35.730> pictured<00:03:36.510> that<00:03:36.930> I<00:03:37.250> don't<00:03:38.250> know<00:03:38.340> why

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
actually pictured that I don't know why

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.150 
actually pictured that I don't know why
anyway<00:03:39.000> so<00:03:39.060> of<00:03:39.570> course<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.380> next<00:03:40.620> is<00:03:40.860> going<00:03:41.040> to

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
anyway so of course the next is going to

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.100 
anyway so of course the next is going to
be<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.340> extended<00:03:41.910> bow<00:03:42.120> this<00:03:42.660> is<00:03:42.810> gonna<00:03:42.930> be

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
be the extended bow this is gonna be

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.080 
be the extended bow this is gonna be
able<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.350> shoot<00:03:43.920> longer<00:03:44.430> because<00:03:44.760> it's<00:03:44.910> got

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
able to shoot longer because it's got

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.400 
able to shoot longer because it's got
more<00:03:45.239> durability<00:03:45.810> it's<00:03:45.959> gonna<00:03:46.079> do<00:03:46.230> more

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
more durability it's gonna do more

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.560 
more durability it's gonna do more
damage<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:47.040> if<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.519> hold<00:03:47.760> it<00:03:47.880> down<00:03:47.940> for<00:03:48.120> four

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
damage and if you hold it down for four

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.199 
damage and if you hold it down for four
seconds<00:03:49.049> you<00:03:49.470> can<00:03:49.650> get<00:03:49.769> a<00:03:49.950> powered<00:03:50.430> up<00:03:50.640> shot

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
seconds you can get a powered up shot

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.670 
seconds you can get a powered up shot
but<00:03:51.630> of<00:03:51.720> course<00:03:51.900> this<00:03:52.019> is<00:03:52.200> going<00:03:52.350> to<00:03:52.470> slowly

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
but of course this is going to slowly

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.069 
but of course this is going to slowly
take<00:03:53.010> durability<00:03:53.670> off<00:03:53.850> of<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.150> arrow<00:03:54.329> if<00:03:54.660> you

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
take durability off of the arrow if you

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:56.509 
take durability off of the arrow if you
hold<00:03:55.320> it<00:03:55.380> for<00:03:55.530> too<00:03:55.620> long<00:03:55.739> as<00:03:55.920> you<00:03:56.040> can<00:03:56.190> see<00:03:56.310> the

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
hold it for too long as you can see the

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.259 
hold it for too long as you can see the
string<00:03:57.060> will<00:03:57.239> turn<00:03:57.450> red<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:57.870> boom<00:03:58.140> pegged<00:03:59.040> him

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
string will turn red and boom pegged him

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.819 
string will turn red and boom pegged him
kill<00:04:00.269> shot<00:04:00.600> that<00:04:01.140> was<00:04:01.260> amazing
