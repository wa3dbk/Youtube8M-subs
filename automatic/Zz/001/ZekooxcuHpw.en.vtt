00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.499
 hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.329
 climb today we'll be back a bit in 

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:14.410
 the past and take a look at the best carbine and 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:16.840
 Battlefield 3 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.480
 yes yes, I decided to finish a series of videos under 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.210
 name the best of the best immediately speak 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.370
 this choice is my opinion and you I 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.040
 I recommend to write in the comments what 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.370
 carbine you think is the best in the battlefield 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.420
 3 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:33.280
 and we start with long distances and 7w or 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.649
 carbine which first appeared in 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.350
 composed Claus qua torso supplement this 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.629
 was the debut of this carbine in a series of games 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.820
 battlefield and si double ar 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.589
 amazing carbine in battlefield 3 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.719
 the fact is that his path 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:47.620
 this is no long distance you do not 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:50.319
 heard 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.089
 ec7 rv battlefield 3 is for 

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:54.999
 work at a distance and not as in 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:57.190
 battlefield 4 superfood spam gun for 

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:59.440
 short and medium distances to this 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.019
 contributes to a unique damage model 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.789
 grindal cartridge which uses all 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.040
 and wr in battlefield 3 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:10.090
 it gives a maximum damage of 20 units 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.040
 and the minimum damage is 16.7 although 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.719
 peculiar to the class of carbines 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:19.119
 minimum damage 14.3 main advantages are 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:21.399
 the above minimum damage which 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.070
 highest in closing of himself also 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:26.140
 can be attributed to very low returns as 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.210
 vertically and horizontally and si 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.909
 double ar in addition has a very 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.729
 high rate of 850 shots 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.250
 per minute, coupled with minimal damage 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.770
 and recoil gives us some kind of incredible 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.899
 result in efficiency on average and 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.969
 long distance and last plus and 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.719
 self was a yuar it is very fast 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:47.039
 recharge 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:49.780
 actual in the best traditions of the platform 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:52.179
 ar-15 only takes you one 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.219
 eighty five hundredths of a second full 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.250
 take 2 and a half seconds now 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:57.290
 a little about min 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.930
 with the first one can be called a small store 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.120
 twenty six rounds of 2 is low 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.390
 melee effectiveness at a distance 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:08.869
 up to 12 meters you do not shoot m5 to 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:12.080
 or AEK-971 and all because of the low 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.360
 maximum damage from long distances 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.900
 go to the most variable flour 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.670
 robin 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.040
 and in my opinion this place is rightfully 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.410
 should take the good old scorge 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.080
 scar-h is always in the battlefield game series. 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.720
 experienced a strange metamorphosis then he 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.120
 assault rifle as in battlefield 4 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.060
 fine robin like in battlefield 2 in 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.590
 battlefield3 scart went through the archaic 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.360
 tracks and stalkers 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.360
 despite the fact that he uses a cartridge 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.880
 762 scar does not kill with three 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.400
 cartridges at a short distance but with 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.500
 like j3 i 3 it has a low tempo 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.840
 shooting and small shop for 20 rounds 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.000
 whole even despite this sad 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.010
 the fact of belongings is truly variable 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.560
 carbine it shows itself well in 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.420
 many situations like tdm 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.940
 or big conquest 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.190
 he will not let you down as in melee so 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.350
 and long distances from the pros skora 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.530
 can highlight the speed of killing 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.989
 despite low damage for caliber 762 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.690
 from the stern skilled hands can arrange 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.370
 total shooter on servak second plus 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.940
 this returns despite the high 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.709
 vertical impact 0.5 belongings very 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.540
 well controlled and everything 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.489
 thanks to initial recoil 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.040
 which is almost none unlike 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.019
 class 3 plus is low 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.570
 scatter when shooting in static 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.940
 the position of the belongings of a very accurate carbine with 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.860
 thickened stem threading it can 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.079
 argue only with both to us and now 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.090
 slightly minus the scar has a bit 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:41.630
 long recharge which 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.370
 durations close to boo dads and now 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.560
 let's talk about short distances here 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.780
 the king can rightly be considered the muhtar 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.030
 motor is a little famas which 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.100
 debuted in battlefield 3 and entered into 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.810
 composition of claus apartment 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.610
 There is no better map for this add-on. 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.590
 the trunk for the engineer principal 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.430
 competitors of the author can only be considered 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.819
 m 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.920
 I 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.569
 me which is similar in some 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.370
 characteristics amount tare 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.439
 they have about the same duration 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.829
 recharge very similar damage in the near 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:12.200
 the battle has similar recoil but the difference is 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.689
 i was driving antara there is one trump in 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.489
 sleeve which makes it more 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:18.530
 suitable for melee gontar this 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.810
 Bullpap and this means that he is much 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.500
 more precisely when shooting from the hip and this 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.470
 first plus 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.580
 a chore 50 percent more precisely about the century when 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.949
 shooting from the hip 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.740
 if we install alsu he will not be 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:33.320
 equal to the second plus is the rate of fire he 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.180
 is 900 rounds per minute this 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.520
 highest in class 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.500
 carbines 3 plus it's very high 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.960
 bullet hit speed 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.830
 second in class carbines for this 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.870
 characteristic 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.840
 and now let's move on to the minuses I'm not to 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.449
 Sorry very serious matar bullpapa 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.180
 that means he has very big 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:55.400
 problems with recharge recharge mtor 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.050
 and it takes three and a half seconds and 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.300
 if the cartridges remain in the store then 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.759
 reloading tactical takes you 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.740
 three seconds a second minus is high 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:06.320
 recoil for such a rate of fire 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.930
 it can be controlled but difficult if 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.030
 we will compare it with fellow on supplement 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.090
 it's with a carbine ah sy double double ap which 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.880
 has a rate of fire of 850 shots at 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.430
 a minute then we note that uar 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.340
 has a return that is almost two 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:25.430
 times lower than our Israeli 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.860
 carbine but here is my list of the best 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.840
 carabiners battlefield 3 in the comments i 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.419
 waiting for your options I think that's all 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.949
 thanks for watching subscribe 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:38.289
 comment put the likes in the repost 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:38.289
 This video will see you on the battlefield for now.
