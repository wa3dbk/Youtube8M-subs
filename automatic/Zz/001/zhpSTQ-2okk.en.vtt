force drop other than pyro Pete and
that's<00:01:01.770> just<00:01:01.980> because<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.399> fact<00:01:02.609> that

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
that's just because of the fact that

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.670 
that's just because of the fact that
pyro<00:01:03.000> Pete<00:01:03.270> has<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.780> chance<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.350> pretty<00:01:04.619> much

my favorite thing about this grenade mod

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.130 
my favorite thing about this grenade mod

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
is the fact that it actually doesn't

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.560 
is the fact that it actually doesn't
feel<00:01:16.530> as<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.950> muscle<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.610> feels<00:01:17.880> more<00:01:18.210> like<00:01:18.299> an

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
feel as a muscle it feels more like an

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.770 
feel as a muscle it feels more like an
on<00:01:18.869> demand<00:01:19.170> action<00:01:19.680> skill<00:01:20.220> like<00:01:20.790> axes<00:01:21.420> turret

on demand action skill like axes turret
once<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.409> throw<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.830> out<00:01:22.950> there<00:01:23.130> it's<00:01:23.400> static

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
once you throw it out there it's static

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.149 
once you throw it out there it's static
it's<00:01:24.390> gonna<00:01:24.659> spin<00:01:25.080> around<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.680> it's<00:01:25.950> gonna

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
it's gonna spin around and it's gonna

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.700 
it's gonna spin around and it's gonna
control<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.970> entire<00:01:27.420> area<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.439> tossed

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710
