00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.070
 is taking good credit 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.490
 great but that seems to me completely 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.490
 displaced does not react 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:32.489
 Yup 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:34.730
 I saw you can't compete with apple trees 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.730
 marks 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.060
 I would have expected something more 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.060
 emotion 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.690
 okay i'm feeling tired of 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.949
 having fun with which I believe is better 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.590
 get it over with 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.590
 and so now I'll show you I blow 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.399
 you can't be so naive as not to have 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:01.390
 understood the difference between mine 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.890
 strength is yours 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.890
 after the thin figure you made 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:15.070
 then we see a holter or up to ten 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.899
 before you disappear like this forever 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.679
 you will have a few seconds to repent 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:34.270
 your evil deeds now begin to 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:39.399
 count 23 there will be better to invent 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:41.259
 something in fight too and in short enough 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.179
 boy now we all understand that 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.460
 you are very strong please stop 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.229
 play and destroy that monster ahead 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.149
 move 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.409
 unless he has some strange in mind 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.409
 final attack plan 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.610
 if the wait they bother you she trusts 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.200
 attack me and I'll take you out in a 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.220
 moment I assure you that they will not remain 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.220
 between cdp 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.200
 visco you ca n't compete 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.200
 I chose 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.150
 original 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.810
 you didn't want it 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:41.959
 I really think that I read 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:43.520
 we have the possibilities to save ourselves and 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.020
 fellow here 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.020
 you know you have to go away by yourself 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.830
 the level of advice to lower a 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.140
 little the crest 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.239
 I can assure you that this time it did not fail 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.580
 the defy witty people and half to a 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.580
 way to stop them as long as it takes 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.780
 Yes No 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.879
 the courage to give him the coup de grace 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:12.680
 hey don't tell me who you are already tired of you 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.760
