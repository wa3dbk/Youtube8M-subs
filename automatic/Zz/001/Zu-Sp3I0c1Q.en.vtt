there<00:00:01.860> is<00:00:02.159> a<00:00:02.220> common<00:00:02.760> misunderstanding<00:00:03.230> that

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
there is a common misunderstanding that

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.839 
there is a common misunderstanding that
when<00:00:05.160> you're<00:00:05.400> in<00:00:05.910> space<00:00:07.040> gravity<00:00:08.040> has<00:00:08.370> no

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
when you're in space gravity has no

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.390 
when you're in space gravity has no
effect<00:00:09.830> like<00:00:10.830> this<00:00:11.010> couldn't<00:00:11.309> be<00:00:11.340> further

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
effect like this couldn't be further

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.509 
effect like this couldn't be further
from<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.150> truth<00:00:12.240> for<00:00:13.200> only<00:00:13.469> two<00:00:14.309> things

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
from the truth for only two things

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.570 
from the truth for only two things
actually<00:00:14.880> have<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.360> direct<00:00:16.020> effect<00:00:16.139> on<00:00:16.580> gravity

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
actually have a direct effect on gravity

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.519 
actually have a direct effect on gravity
which<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.420> larger<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.470> mess<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:21.170> the<00:00:22.170> closer

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
which is larger a mess and the closer

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.279 
which is larger a mess and the closer
you<00:00:23.340> are<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.029> larger<00:00:24.480> mass<00:00:24.720> has<00:00:24.990> more

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
you are so a larger mass has more

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.220 
you are so a larger mass has more
gravity<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.849> closer<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.330> are<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.750> more

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
gravity and the closer you are the more

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.730 
gravity and the closer you are the more
gravitational<00:00:29.010> pull<00:00:29.429> further<00:00:30.300> away<00:00:30.740> less

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
gravitational pull further away less

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.160

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
gravitational pull smaller mass less

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.150 
gravitational pull smaller mass less
gravitational<00:00:34.890> pull<00:00:35.840> so<00:00:36.840> why<00:00:36.989> then<00:00:37.170> do<00:00:37.890> and

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
gravitational pull so why then do and

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.479 
gravitational pull so why then do and
people<00:00:39.090> are<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.420> orbit<00:00:39.920> appear<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.370> be

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489

reason<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.460> when<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.450> are<00:00:48.800> falling<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:50.430> earth

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
reason is when you are falling to earth

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.840

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.900 
first place do this multiple times you
can<00:02:30.480> dramatically<00:02:31.110> speed<00:02:31.380> up<00:02:31.709> your

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
can dramatically speed up your

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:39.470 
can dramatically speed up your
spaceships<00:02:33.230> velocity<00:02:35.630> okay<00:02:36.830> so<00:02:37.830> why<00:02:38.069> then<00:02:38.480> did

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
spaceships velocity okay so why then did

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.930 
spaceships velocity okay so why then did
people<00:02:39.840> want<00:02:39.989> to<00:02:40.170> set<00:02:40.380> up<00:02:40.530> bases<00:02:41.370> on<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:41.819> moon

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
people want to set up bases on the moon

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.610 
people want to set up bases on the moon
and<00:02:42.810> mars<00:02:43.050> for<00:02:43.950> traveling<00:02:44.370> into<00:02:44.850> space<00:02:45.620> well

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
and mars for traveling into space well

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.930 
and mars for traveling into space well
actually<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:47.070> Earth's<00:02:47.190> gravity<00:02:47.670> is<00:02:47.760> actually

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
actually the Earth's gravity is actually

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.300 
actually the Earth's gravity is actually
quite<00:02:48.239> a<00:02:48.330> strong<00:02:48.780> force<00:02:49.230> because<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.220> earth

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
quite a strong force because the earth

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.420 
quite a strong force because the earth
is<00:02:50.459> actually<00:02:50.760> quite<00:02:50.880> a<00:02:51.000> large<00:02:51.390> mess<00:02:52.310> but<00:02:53.310> the

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
is actually quite a large mess but the

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.570 
is actually quite a large mess but the
moon<00:02:54.050> Mars<00:02:55.050> actually<00:02:55.440> gets<00:02:55.769> smaller<00:02:56.220> mass

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
moon Mars actually gets smaller mass

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.620 
moon Mars actually gets smaller mass
before<00:02:57.269> they<00:02:57.570> have<00:02:57.660> less<00:02:57.930> gravitational<00:02:58.620> pull

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
before they have less gravitational pull

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.059 
before they have less gravitational pull
when<00:03:00.630> you're<00:03:00.750> actually<00:03:00.930> trying<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.590> launch

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
when you're actually trying to launch

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.690 
when you're actually trying to launch
rocket<00:03:02.640> mostly<00:03:03.239> it's<00:03:03.360> not<00:03:03.480> actually<00:03:03.810> going<00:03:04.440> up

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
rocket mostly it's not actually going up

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.400 
rocket mostly it's not actually going up
what<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:05.819> try<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.030> do<00:03:06.209> is<00:03:06.360> reach<00:03:06.660> that<00:03:06.930> escape

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
what you try to do is reach that escape

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.500 
what you try to do is reach that escape
velocities<00:03:07.950> when<00:03:08.190> you<00:03:08.310> actually<00:03:08.489> pull<00:03:09.330> out

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
velocities when you actually pull out

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.160 
velocities when you actually pull out
and<00:03:10.290> go<00:03:10.500> out<00:03:10.620> into<00:03:10.650> space<00:03:11.330> the<00:03:12.330> larger<00:03:12.989> a

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
and go out into space the larger a

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.100 
and go out into space the larger a
planet's<00:03:13.830> mass<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:15.120> greater<00:03:15.150> your<00:03:15.750> escape

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
planet's mass the greater your escape

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.270 
planet's mass the greater your escape
velocity<00:03:17.150> smaller<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.540> mass<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:19.890> actual

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
velocity smaller the mass the actual

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.840 
velocity smaller the mass the actual
less<00:03:20.940> your<00:03:21.660> air<00:03:21.930> speed<00:03:22.440> needs<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:23.070> be<00:03:23.220> there

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
less your air speed needs to be there

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.970 
less your air speed needs to be there
put<00:03:24.000> because<00:03:24.209> you're<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.510> big<00:03:24.870> overcoming<00:03:25.380> less

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
put because you're a big overcoming less

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.789 
put because you're a big overcoming less
so<00:03:26.160> gravitational<00:03:26.850> pull<00:03:27.230> therefore<00:03:28.230> if<00:03:28.620> you

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
so gravitational pull therefore if you

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.140 
so gravitational pull therefore if you
can<00:03:28.920> establish<00:03:29.160> a<00:03:29.519> base<00:03:29.850> on<00:03:30.060> moon<00:03:30.540> or<00:03:31.170> mars

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
can establish a base on moon or mars

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.180 
can establish a base on moon or mars

Moon or Mars for exploring solar system
it's<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.590> mass<00:03:49.890> of<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.670> planet<00:03:50.790> it's<00:03:51.510> having
