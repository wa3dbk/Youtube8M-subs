00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.010 
opportunity to test it out properly I
won't<00:00:21.340> go<00:00:21.520> into<00:00:21.790> all<00:00:21.970> the<00:00:22.150> features<00:00:22.180> in<00:00:22.870> this

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.020 
won't go into all the features in this

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.380 
won't go into all the features in this
video<00:00:23.380> as<00:00:23.650> I've<00:00:24.130> done<00:00:24.340> it<00:00:24.490> in<00:00:24.670> a<00:00:24.790> previous<00:00:25.030> one

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
video as I've done it in a previous one

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.630 
video as I've done it in a previous one
instead<00:00:25.990> I<00:00:26.170> want<00:00:26.530> to<00:00:26.590> share<00:00:26.980> my<00:00:27.130> experience

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
instead I want to share my experience

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.760 
instead I want to share my experience
using<00:00:27.850> it<00:00:28.120> the<00:00:28.630> main<00:00:28.780> points<00:00:29.230> I<00:00:29.350> want<00:00:29.560> to<00:00:29.650> go

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
using it the main points I want to go

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.000 
using it the main points I want to go
through<00:00:30.160> are<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:31.480> motor<00:00:31.690> response<00:00:32.200> signal

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
through are the motor response signal

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.900 
through are the motor response signal
strength<00:00:33.660> battery<00:00:34.660> life<00:00:34.870> and<00:00:35.170> noise<00:00:35.680> the<00:00:36.670> film

I<00:00:37.060> was<00:00:37.240> shooting<00:00:37.600> had<00:00:37.870> quite<00:00:38.200> a<00:00:38.380> common<00:00:38.829> fill

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
I was shooting had quite a common fill

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.310 
I was shooting had quite a common fill
so<00:00:39.489> my<00:00:39.670> focus<00:00:39.970> puller<00:00:40.180> didn't<00:00:40.780> have<00:00:40.960> to<00:00:41.110> try

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
so my focus puller didn't have to try

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.890 
so my focus puller didn't have to try
too<00:00:41.380> hard<00:00:41.560> to<00:00:42.070> hit<00:00:42.370> the<00:00:42.430> fox<00:00:42.700> marks<00:00:43.150> in<00:00:43.600> fact

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
too hard to hit the fox marks in fact

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.900 
too hard to hit the fox marks in fact
the<00:00:44.050> response<00:00:44.440> time<00:00:44.739> of<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:45.160> motor<00:00:45.370> was<00:00:45.700> much

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
the response time of the motor was much

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.180 
the response time of the motor was much
better<00:00:46.270> than<00:00:46.600> what<00:00:46.840> we<00:00:47.020> needed<00:00:47.230> for<00:00:47.560> our<00:00:47.770> shots

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
better than what we needed for our shots

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.060 
better than what we needed for our shots
the<00:00:48.850> motor<00:00:49.060> has<00:00:49.360> literally<00:00:49.600> no<00:00:49.930> delay<00:00:50.410> so<00:00:51.010> you

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
the motor has literally no delay so you

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.610 
the motor has literally no delay so you
can<00:00:51.280> track<00:00:51.640> pretty<00:00:52.210> complicated<00:00:52.540> moves<00:00:52.989> the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
can track pretty complicated moves the

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.470 
can track pretty complicated moves the
focus<00:00:53.920> puller<00:00:54.070> was<00:00:54.340> pulling<00:00:54.670> quite<00:00:54.880> close<00:00:55.180> to

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
focus puller was pulling quite close to

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.780 
focus puller was pulling quite close to
the<00:00:55.600> camera<00:00:55.989> so<00:00:56.290> we<00:00:56.440> haven't<00:00:56.680> had<00:00:56.829> any<00:00:57.280> issues

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
the camera so we haven't had any issues

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.970 
the camera so we haven't had any issues
with<00:00:57.820> the<00:00:58.180> signal<00:00:58.510> strength<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:59.440> remote<00:00:59.710> air

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
with the signal strength the remote air

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.729 
with the signal strength the remote air
has<00:01:00.190> about<00:01:00.460> 300<00:01:01.090> feet<00:01:01.390> of<00:01:01.540> range<00:01:01.750> so<00:01:02.410> this<00:01:02.590> full

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
has about 300 feet of range so this full

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.109 
has about 300 feet of range so this full
of<00:01:02.770> focus<00:01:03.130> could<00:01:03.280> be<00:01:03.399> used<00:01:03.610> on<00:01:03.790> things<00:01:04.030> like

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
of focus could be used on things like

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.780 
of focus could be used on things like
movie<00:01:04.629> or<00:01:04.870> a<00:01:05.620> Steadicam<00:01:06.190> without<00:01:06.520> any

didn't have to recharge the follow focus

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.149 
didn't have to recharge the follow focus

I've<00:01:12.310> been<00:01:12.490> asked<00:01:12.729> if<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:12.940> motor<00:01:13.120> makes<00:01:13.420> any

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
I've been asked if the motor makes any

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.230 
I've been asked if the motor makes any
noise<00:01:13.690> our<00:01:14.409> Sun<00:01:14.710> record<00:01:15.040> is<00:01:15.159> claimed<00:01:15.549> that<00:01:15.940> he

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
noise our Sun record is claimed that he

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.539 
noise our Sun record is claimed that he
could<00:01:16.270> hear<00:01:16.810> it<00:01:16.930> in<00:01:17.049> a<00:01:17.290> scene<00:01:17.590> where<00:01:18.310> it<00:01:18.400> was

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
could hear it in a scene where it was

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.370 
could hear it in a scene where it was
supposed<00:01:18.820> to<00:01:18.970> be<00:01:19.090> completely<00:01:19.479> quiet<00:01:19.750> without

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
supposed to be completely quiet without

any dialogue but in a situation where
you<00:01:23.409> would<00:01:23.470> actually<00:01:23.740> want<00:01:24.310> to<00:01:24.549> use<00:01:24.729> a

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
you would actually want to use a

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.359 
you would actually want to use a
wireless<00:01:25.210> full<00:01:25.510> of<00:01:25.630> focus<00:01:25.990> like<00:01:26.590> handheld<00:01:27.100> or

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
Steadicam shots the amount of noise this

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.149 
Steadicam shots the amount of noise this
model<00:01:30.340> produces<00:01:30.820> would<00:01:31.299> be<00:01:31.479> inaudible

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
model produces would be inaudible

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.679 
model produces would be inaudible
overall<00:01:33.159> I<00:01:33.310> was<00:01:33.580> really<00:01:33.640> impressed<00:01:34.090> with<00:01:34.479> the

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
overall I was really impressed with the

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
performance of the unit and it helped us

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.520 
performance of the unit and it helped us
achieve<00:01:37.210> a<00:01:37.390> few<00:01:37.570> shots<00:01:37.840> that<00:01:38.110> would<00:01:38.260> have<00:01:38.409> been

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
achieve a few shots that would have been

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.830 
achieve a few shots that would have been
very<00:01:38.710> difficult<00:01:39.010> to<00:01:39.400> pull<00:01:39.549> off<00:01:39.700> with<00:01:40.330> a<00:01:40.540> manual

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
very difficult to pull off with a manual

very difficult to pull off with a manual
