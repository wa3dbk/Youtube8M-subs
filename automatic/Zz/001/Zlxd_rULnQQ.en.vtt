that<00:00:46.440> could<00:00:46.590> be<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> bit<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.039> drive<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.579> I

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
that could be a bit to drive so I

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.060 
that could be a bit to drive so I

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
great source of protein so even though

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.789 
great source of protein so even though
we're<00:01:18.570> going<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.780> have<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.990> sweetness<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
we're going to have the sweetness of the

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.460 
we're going to have the sweetness of the
day's<00:01:20.570> protein<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.780> warm<00:01:21.990> up<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.259> actually

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
day's protein in the warm up to actually

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.080 
day's protein in the warm up to actually
have<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.710> balance<00:01:22.920> your<00:01:23.189> blood<00:01:23.369> glucose<00:01:23.820> level

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
have to balance your blood glucose level

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.539 
have to balance your blood glucose level
so<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.270> want<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.600> get<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.720> sugar<00:01:24.960> spike<00:01:25.549> now

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
so you want to get a sugar spike now

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.670 
so you want to get a sugar spike now
with<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.850> dates<00:01:27.119> you'll<00:01:27.810> need<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.229> pick<00:01:28.409> them

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
with the dates you'll need to pick them

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.380 
with the dates you'll need to pick them
so<00:01:28.920> any<00:01:29.159> image<00:01:29.400> all<00:01:29.579> day<00:01:29.759> we'll<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.119> big

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
so any image all day we'll have a big

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.080 
so any image all day we'll have a big
fat<00:01:30.689> peep<00:01:30.960> inside<00:01:31.170> one<00:01:32.130> today<00:01:32.340> itís<00:01:32.610> chop<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
fat peep inside one today itís chop the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.700 
fat peep inside one today itís chop the
data<00:01:33.299> really<00:01:33.960> rustically<00:01:36.290> all<00:01:37.290> I'm<00:01:37.470> going<00:01:37.650> to

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
data really rustically all I'm going to

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.760 
data really rustically all I'm going to
do<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.159> sprinkle<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:39.420> chocolate<00:01:40.079> pattern<00:01:40.320> now

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
do is sprinkle the chocolate pattern now

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.109 
do is sprinkle the chocolate pattern now
this<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.070> fun<00:01:41.340> bit<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.729> this<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:41.970> bit

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
the protein and and good fats those are

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.560 
the protein and and good fats those are
mega<00:02:09.259> three<00:02:09.709> fatty<00:02:10.429> acids<00:02:11.030> those

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
mega three fatty acids those

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.250 
mega three fatty acids those
monounsaturated<00:02:11.990> fats<00:02:12.980> but<00:02:13.580> days<00:02:14.540> dried

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
monounsaturated fats but days dried

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.780 
monounsaturated fats but days dried
dates<00:02:15.500> are<00:02:15.709> actually<00:02:15.920> really<00:02:16.070> high<00:02:16.370> in<00:02:16.400> iron

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
dates are actually really high in iron

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.210 
dates are actually really high in iron
now<00:02:17.480> we<00:02:17.540> need<00:02:17.810> iron<00:02:18.050> to<00:02:18.350> make<00:02:18.380> energy<00:02:18.800> but<00:02:19.190> also

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
now we need iron to make energy but also

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.400 
now we need iron to make energy but also
to<00:02:19.520> help<00:02:19.640> oxygenate<00:02:20.060> our<00:02:20.450> bladder<00:02:20.750> obviously
