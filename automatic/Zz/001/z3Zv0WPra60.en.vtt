inside here okay

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.939 
inside here okay
now<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.149> important<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.809> when<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.140> here<00:00:58.559> you

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
now the important is when you here you

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
still and block like this that toe would

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.740 
still and block like this that toe would
land<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:08.670> that's<00:01:08.880> why<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.299> have<00:01:09.630> to
