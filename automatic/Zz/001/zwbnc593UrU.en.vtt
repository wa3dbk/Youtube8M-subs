in a way I think about the wolf of Wall

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.250 
in a way I think about the wolf of Wall
Street<00:02:48.190> well<00:02:48.490> it's<00:02:48.760> not<00:02:49.060> is<00:02:49.270> not<00:02:49.540> Leonardo

but<00:02:54.070> i<00:02:56.310> love<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.520> way<00:02:57.550> also<00:02:58.210> this<00:02:58.420> guy<00:02:58.630> wants

to also feel live and he has is a true
bad<00:03:04.030> guy<00:03:04.300> but<00:03:04.690> he<00:03:05.430> it's<00:03:06.430> so<00:03:06.730> I<00:03:06.940> mean<00:03:07.150> he's<00:03:07.390> a

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
bad guy but he it's so I mean he's a

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.680 
bad guy but he it's so I mean he's a
wolf<00:03:07.810> because<00:03:08.260> he<00:03:08.460> he<00:03:09.460> wants<00:03:09.880> something<00:03:10.210> with

she's<00:03:11.050> visceral<00:03:12.040> and<00:03:12.940> I<00:03:13.060> think<00:03:13.330> which<00:03:13.480> has

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
she's visceral and I think which has

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.620 
she's visceral and I think which has
existed<00:03:14.050> since<00:03:14.740> dawn<00:03:15.280> of<00:03:15.400> time<00:03:15.430> in<00:03:16.420> human

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
existed since dawn of time in human

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.990 
existed since dawn of time in human
nature<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.740> so<00:03:18.610> I<00:03:18.850> think<00:03:18.970> as<00:03:19.270> long<00:03:19.570> as

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
nature and so I think as long as

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.480 
nature and so I think as long as
screenwriters<00:03:22.000> are<00:03:22.300> able<00:03:22.660> to<00:03:23.310> make<00:03:24.310> any

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
screenwriters are able to make any

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:30.680 
screenwriters are able to make any
character<00:03:25.180> with<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:26.500> can<00:03:26.740> be<00:03:26.890> a<00:03:27.070> loser<00:03:27.430> or<00:03:28.000> a

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
character with it can be a loser or a

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.000 
character with it can be a loser or a
multi-millionaire<00:03:31.690> I<00:03:31.750> mean<00:03:31.990> any<00:03:32.230> character

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
multi-millionaire I mean any character

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.990 
multi-millionaire I mean any character
if<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:34.450> writer<00:03:34.690> is<00:03:34.840> able<00:03:35.260> to<00:03:35.500> make<00:03:36.280> us<00:03:36.460> relate

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
if the writer is able to make us relate

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
if the writer is able to make us relate
to<00:03:37.180> him<00:03:37.420> through<00:03:37.810> a<00:03:39.120> something<00:03:40.120> visible<00:03:40.750> I

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
to him through a something visible I

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.630 
to him through a something visible I
think<00:03:41.260> it's<00:03:41.440> it<00:03:41.800> should<00:03:42.070> be<00:03:42.160> something<00:03:42.400> with

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
think it's it should be something with

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.200 
think it's it should be something with
this<00:03:42.940> or<00:03:43.150> something<00:03:43.740> we<00:03:44.760> which<00:03:45.760> is<00:03:46.000> something
