00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.500
 what's there is the point in this 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.900
 drilled case a gun head what 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.820
 that we already said that the piston brings a 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.369
 reference mark to place it 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.500
 usually related to what is 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.060
 the accounting part motor in the box 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.679
 some cases it may not look like 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.570
 that might appear powered from 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.949
 what we already know 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.860
 at this time what related to 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.110
 poisons 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.020
 ass displacement 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.110
 those are precisely the rings with what 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:40.630
 what are the ones with the rings 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:43.950
 chunks says today the ancap spam 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.950
 it's the end 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:52.020
 says it's going to be put in relation to the 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.020
 reference point 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:03.520
 and that is a fact is necessary that is the 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.760
 Factory order 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.150
 based on michelle okay says today the 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.800
 hangar 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.800
 the other one could say here 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.250
 is not that you in this information and 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.370
 then this one is going to put it this way and 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.250
 this other way not all four then 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.660
 that there is going to be the same with the 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.900
 same edge and with the same sequence 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.570
 exactly 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.030
 because it is said that it is not good to throw away 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.920
 rings towards the center towards the skirt 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.650
 it's not so much the skirt is the fault, not the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.810
 is going to happen more things 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.329
 if not because at another time 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.479
 the ring and the joints that 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:49.920
 recharged against the cylinder would be the 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.920
 equivalent to me doing this 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:02:00.020
 to scratch the next one you can do is 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.850
 that then as more as there is a 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.190
 point of much burden is for those who 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.040
 they are displaced slightly why 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.170
 reason not to the side of the good ball 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.240
 because it turns out that if this ring 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.640
 we could here more easily the 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.970
 compression I would have would tend to 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.470
 move and escape more easily the idea 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.810
 of this its producing a trap 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.570
 let's remember then for what is 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:30.790
 inevitable because by that time 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:30.790
 close the ring 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.910
 let's say it's a way of thinking is 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.910
 true 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.659
 i 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.750
 although facebook 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.750
 It was you 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.640
 part of the league from madrid 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.920
 Y 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.720
 why 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:43.360
 from the in a little harder 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.360
 of the document lasted two hours 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.780
 then it is for use that paul and saves 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:57.180
 screws and nuts where specified 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:05:01.090
 why to avoid excesses is going to be 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:04.270
 now private is not the same 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.160
 with this and noticed already and I calculated it to 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:10.260
 me what interests me to get out of there for 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.260
 get several screws and nuts
