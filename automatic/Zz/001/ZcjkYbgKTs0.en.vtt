00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
just doing it one way is that I'll just

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.300 
just doing it one way is that I'll just
use<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:05.630> window<00:01:06.630> capture<00:01:06.920> you<00:01:07.920> can<00:01:08.070> set<00:01:08.280> it

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.960 
use a window capture you can set it
window<00:01:08.640> capture<00:01:09.920> so<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.250> already<00:01:11.580> have<00:01:11.820> it

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
window capture so I already have it

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.280 
window capture so I already have it
setup<00:01:12.920> window<00:01:13.920> capture<00:01:14.299> okay<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.930> then<00:01:16.170> you

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
setup window capture okay and then you

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.929 
setup window capture okay and then you
can<00:01:16.409> set<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.950> Xbox<00:01:17.369> app<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.790> then

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
can set it to the Xbox app and then

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.510 
can set it to the Xbox app and then
you'll<00:01:18.090> hit<00:01:18.240> ok<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:20.070> when<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.310> begin

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
via the monitor capture way I wouldn't

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.400 
via the monitor capture way I wouldn't
recommend<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.910> because<00:02:12.090> it's<00:02:12.390> kind<00:02:12.629> of<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.780> mess

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
recommend it because it's kind of a mess

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.920 
recommend it because it's kind of a mess
but<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.640> go<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.820> monitor<00:02:15.180> capture<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:15.840> you

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
but you go to monitor capture and you

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.810 
but you go to monitor capture and you
just<00:02:16.110> select<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.370> allows<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.730> to

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
capture monitor the only benefit I would

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.980 
capture monitor the only benefit I would
see<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.520> doing<00:02:20.790> this<00:02:20.910> is<00:02:20.970> if<00:02:21.210> you<00:02:21.540> wanted<00:02:21.870> to

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
see of doing this is if you wanted to

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.310 
see of doing this is if you wanted to
have<00:02:22.200> your<00:02:22.580> xbox<00:02:23.720> window<00:02:24.720> open<00:02:25.050> while<00:02:25.230> you

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
have your xbox window open while you

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.890 
have your xbox window open while you
were<00:02:25.440> streaming<00:02:25.740> and<00:02:26.130> you'd<00:02:26.850> have<00:02:27.090> it<00:02:27.330> set<00:02:27.690> so

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
were streaming and you'd have it set so

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.780 
were streaming and you'd have it set so
that<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.590> only<00:02:28.740> blocked<00:02:29.040> out<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.250> certain<00:02:29.610> core

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
that it only blocked out a certain core

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.460 
that it only blocked out a certain core
in<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:29.940> screen<00:02:30.210> and<00:02:30.330> you<00:02:30.420> wanted<00:02:30.630> to<00:02:30.780> show<00:02:31.290> who

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
in the screen and you wanted to show who

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.710 
in the screen and you wanted to show who
is<00:02:31.590> in<00:02:31.710> your<00:02:31.830> party<00:02:32.220> or<00:02:32.550> whatever<00:02:32.790> I<00:02:33.180> don't

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
is in your party or whatever I don't

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.720 
is in your party or whatever I don't
know<00:02:33.810> why<00:02:33.990> some<00:02:34.920> people<00:02:35.160> would<00:02:35.220> like<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.400> do<00:02:35.580> it

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
know why some people would like to do it

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.140 
know why some people would like to do it
but<00:02:36.630> I<00:02:36.870> personally<00:02:37.260> wouldn't<00:02:37.530> recommend<00:02:38.040> it

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
but I personally wouldn't recommend it

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.000
