00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.650
 do not make it easy today the escalope of 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.360
 chicken lacquered in citrus sauce 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:29.610
 first I'm going to set up a base of one 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:32.850
 syrup using drinking water and summoning 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:39.870
 a brown sugar that I will go 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:43.110
 decrease or see completely 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.980
 I went in two circuses besides the piece that has 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.820
 low acidity and Sicilian lemon with 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:57.240
 south another punch of both 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:01:02.780
 dilution has already been fully 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:09.840
 Juice of the tongue of the piece followed by the juice 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:18.409
 of the Sicilian lemon and I call my player 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:21.869
 zinho to bring what goes 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:28.729
 add our sauce 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:34.710
 all the charm of the piece's minimal splinter 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:40.950
 and the sicilian lemon of the murderer and elevates 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:42.979
 a little cute for him to do and reduce 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.560
 at a syrup level 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:50.490
 I'll go there in parallel and I'll go 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:57.060
 working our seville pie or 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:59.490
 loosens unheated olive oil and 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.299
 I'm going to release this wonder these peas 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:08.229
 pies here in our frying pan 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:13.840
 nonstick loose 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:18.629
 daughters of a light salt water in it and 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.629
 draw a small patch of salt 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:32.500
 In this time I come and make a new one. 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:36.400
 The emotion of my syrup then 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:40.000
 our pepper mix that I've put together 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.519
 three kinds of pepper that I am the qa 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.410
 woman right now 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.410
 at this point you save 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:59.599
 our our syrup begins to take 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.599
 form 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.579
 At this point I can release a 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:11.489
 little more of these splinters of the Sicilian 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:15.930
 for I am not 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:21.060
 these aromas but especially he as 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:24.689
 facilitating management and our view 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:30.290
 daughters are at the very crisp point and 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:36.139
 this is the footprint of these lines and already 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:40.500
 calls take the field here our 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:45.599
 Chicken scaloppe that I'm going to make 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:50.370
 these inserts here so that a little 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:53.219
 of the salt arrives from one side and 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:58.579
 our our allowing the kingdom 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:58.579
 wonderful and aromatic this 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:06.900
 at this level by that time we 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:12.209
 is as far as the point 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:19.139
 Look what a wonderful thing, then I 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:24.210
 Call me over here and loosen a strand of olive oil. 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:30.440
 oil Ilsinho here so that 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:30.440
 adherent chi of escalope may 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.590
 use 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:52.880
 turn lightly lacquered on top and 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:57.410
 I have set up and observe that the 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.940
 cooking tone or point of 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.090
 notes from the side 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.370
 as the heat comes in 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.050
 she goes the meat is becoming increasingly 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.380
 whiter 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:13.250
 the next point you wish ours 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:15.270
 scaloppe our scaloppe lacks a 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:19.860
 turning 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:24.719
 a turn of the year 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:31.710
 and back to doing our ligation 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:36.930
 on this other side 14 of saved or 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:39.530
 nor more flowers to our on 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.530
 our shoes 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:54.830
 I will then start to increase the 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:58.040
 our plate doing here 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:02.120
 while this point of CearÃ¡ arrives 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:10.490
 that this point is neither past nor 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:15.070
 loosen our sweetened peas which 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:19.900
 they got that glossy tone 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.900
 is the olive oil brought to our girls 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:35.690
 well this level of corruption has arrived 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:41.090
 at the desired point and I call that our 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:43.720
 syrup to be your birthplace of our 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.720
 scaloppe 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:07:02.190
 and this is our easy make of today 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:05.060
 chicken escalope is via lacquered pie 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.060
 in the county
