00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
a red star but other than that it's a

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.960 
a red star but other than that it's a
great<00:00:46.720> 2-pack<00:00:46.930> I<00:00:47.410> just<00:00:48.010> like<00:00:48.220> that<00:00:48.489> this

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
great 2-pack I just like that this

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.400 
great 2-pack I just like that this
version<00:00:49.180> a<00:00:49.450> little<00:00:49.660> better<00:00:49.810> because<00:00:50.050> it's<00:00:50.290> the

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
version a little better because it's the

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.460 
version a little better because it's the
black<00:00:50.650> costume<00:00:51.340> and<00:00:51.790> it's<00:00:51.880> more<00:00:52.320> current<00:00:53.320> in

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
black costume and it's more current in

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.400 
black costume and it's more current in
her<00:00:53.590> look<00:00:53.829> and<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:55.390> also<00:00:55.510> has<00:00:56.370> two<00:00:57.370> extra<00:00:58.410> heads

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
her look and it also has two extra heads

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.750 
her look and it also has two extra heads
which<00:01:00.250> they<00:01:00.460> switched<00:01:00.820> and<00:01:01.170> honestly<00:01:02.170> I<00:01:02.260> think

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
which they switched and honestly I think

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.179 
which they switched and honestly I think
the<00:01:03.760> heads<00:01:04.089> look<00:01:04.509> better<00:01:04.780> this<00:01:05.049> one<00:01:05.350> when<00:01:06.100> he

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 
the heads look better this one when he

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:08.520 
the heads look better this one when he
was<00:01:06.340> two<00:01:06.460> evil<00:01:06.759> winter<00:01:07.030> soldier<00:01:07.420> looks<00:01:08.259> better

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
was two evil winter soldier looks better

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.800 
was two evil winter soldier looks better
than<00:01:08.770> when<00:01:08.829> he's<00:01:09.159> Bucky<00:01:09.579> and<00:01:09.759> even<00:01:10.659> though

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
than when he's Bucky and even though

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.569 
than when he's Bucky and even though
it's<00:01:11.020> not<00:01:11.109> as<00:01:11.259> accurate<00:01:11.619> with<00:01:12.069> the<00:01:12.219> short<00:01:12.520> hair

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:12.579 
it's not as accurate with the short hair

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:14.969 
it's not as accurate with the short hair
for<00:01:13.149> this<00:01:13.270> costume<00:01:13.689> I<00:01:13.899> think<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.740> Black<00:01:14.950> Widow

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
for this costume I think the Black Widow

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.760 
for this costume I think the Black Widow
here<00:01:15.520> looks<00:01:15.880> better<00:01:16.149> than<00:01:16.420> this<00:01:16.749> one<00:01:16.990> in<00:01:17.229> terms

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
here looks better than this one in terms

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.550 
here looks better than this one in terms
of<00:01:17.889> the<00:01:17.979> face<00:01:18.130> sculpt<00:01:18.929> I'll<00:01:19.929> get<00:01:20.139> into<00:01:20.289> that<00:01:20.409> in

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
of the face sculpt I'll get into that in

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.889 
of the face sculpt I'll get into that in
a<00:01:20.829> minute<00:01:21.179> just<00:01:22.179> want<00:01:22.329> to<00:01:22.389> show<00:01:22.479> you<00:01:22.569> weapons

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
a minute just want to show you weapons

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.520 
a minute just want to show you weapons
first<00:01:23.429> she<00:01:24.429> has<00:01:24.609> just<00:01:24.639> a<00:01:25.090> machine<00:01:26.079> gun<00:01:26.499> that

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
first she has just a machine gun that

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.010 
first she has just a machine gun that
they've<00:01:26.889> used<00:01:27.130> before<00:01:27.369> I<00:01:27.609> Hasbro<00:01:28.149> and<00:01:30.899> she<00:01:31.899> has

a<00:01:32.049> handgun<00:01:32.590> here<00:01:33.069> which<00:01:34.029> could<00:01:34.270> either<00:01:34.359> be<00:01:34.689> to

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810

winter soldiers or hers but it looks
better<00:01:37.990> on<00:01:38.049> her<00:01:38.459> because<00:01:39.779> the<00:01:40.779> winter<00:01:41.319> soldier

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
it looks like the Winter Soldier the

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.080 
it looks like the Winter Soldier the
boots<00:02:51.670> of<00:02:51.849> lack<00:02:52.120> and<00:02:53.730> when<00:02:54.730> you<00:02:54.819> switch<00:02:55.060> to

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
winter soldier when he was a bad guy I

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.030

like the shield agent women and to be
honest<00:03:53.019> when<00:03:54.019> you<00:03:54.230> take<00:03:54.470> out<00:03:54.620> this<00:03:54.799> long<00:03:55.930> hair

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
honest when you take out this long hair

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.440 
honest when you take out this long hair
face<00:03:57.319> sculpt<00:03:57.830> which<00:03:58.730> I'll<00:03:58.880> show<00:03:59.060> you<00:03:59.090> in<00:03:59.269> a

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
face sculpt which I'll show you in a

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.400 
face sculpt which I'll show you in a
minute<00:03:59.860> and<00:04:01.299> you<00:04:02.299> put<00:04:02.480> the<00:04:02.630> short<00:04:03.200> hair

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
minute and you put the short hair

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.150 
minute and you put the short hair
version<00:04:04.130> on<00:04:04.280> here<00:04:04.489> I<00:04:05.019> think<00:04:06.019> the<00:04:06.170> version<00:04:06.860> with

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
version on here I think the version with

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.750 
version on here I think the version with
the<00:04:07.340> short<00:04:07.610> hair<00:04:07.670> actually<00:04:08.920> is<00:04:09.920> the<00:04:10.280> better<00:04:10.519> of

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
the short hair actually is the better of

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.119 
the short hair actually is the better of
the<00:04:10.849> two<00:04:11.239> so<00:04:12.230> you<00:04:12.290> got<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:12.650> short<00:04:12.920> hair

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:13.129 
the two so you got the short hair

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:15.880 
the two so you got the short hair
version<00:04:13.640> and<00:04:13.959> you<00:04:14.959> got<00:04:15.110> the<00:04:15.260> long<00:04:15.560> hair<00:04:15.860> and

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
version and you got the long hair and

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.120 
version and you got the long hair and
Winter<00:04:16.190> Soldier<00:04:16.430> version<00:04:17.060> and<00:04:17.769> I<00:04:18.769> think<00:04:18.979> these

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
Winter Soldier version and I think these

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.529 
Winter Soldier version and I think these
two<00:04:19.370> look<00:04:19.579> better<00:04:19.850> than<00:04:20.090> the<00:04:20.299> other<00:04:20.450> two

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
two look better than the other two

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:27.820 
two look better than the other two
versions<00:04:21.370> just<00:04:22.370> my<00:04:22.760> opinion<00:04:24.310> and<00:04:26.830> another

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830
