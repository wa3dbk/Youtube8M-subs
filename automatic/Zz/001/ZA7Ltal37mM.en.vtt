00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.110
 hello let's go with the second of the recipes 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.210
 with hollande serdÃ¡n you already know s go than 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.219
 son with such an original flavor what 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.790
 first thing we're going to do is chop a 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.790
 julienne onion 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.310
 we put it in a saucepan with a good spray 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.310
 Of olive oil 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.670
 we pepper 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.670
 i 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.160
 stir well 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.280
 and we cover it or cover it with paper 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.589
 aluminum and this we are going to leave it to fire 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.539
 slow a half hour stirring from time 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.550
 in when good the idea is to make a 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.679
 homemade hamburger and how I want to treat 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.670
 the meat very delicately I'm going to 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:05.670
 grind myself 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.439
 and I'm going to do it with the biggest plate 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.439
 that I have 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.540
 and I'm going to use veal 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.040
 obviously and in the carnage there was 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.720
 a debate between customers and the 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.490
 Butcher says there is better 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.440
 against some who say that it is better to 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.690
 There are some who say that it is better to mix 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.920
 rib and chop can also be 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.500
 make a good hamburger with 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.850
 sirloin and I'm going to use lid and such 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.500
 It would have been nice to add a 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.800
 little bit of fat there's not much like a 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.800
 20% if you put more the puree meat will be used 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.750
 we put it in the chopper and here 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.820
 what it is about is that those threads that 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.710
 are coming out, you dispose in the same 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.630
 direction in this way when biting the 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.630
 hamburger will be much more delicate 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:18.080
 As you can see, I'm arranging it on paper 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.080
 You can also do it on a plate 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.350
 and now it's about not pressing or 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.540
 press the minimum so that it does not 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.460
 release and obviously it depends on the 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.200
 size of hamburger that you want then 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.200
 you put more meat or less 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.860
 then we roll it 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.740
 and this you can freeze and then it will be 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.620
 easier to chop it as I'm going to 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.150
 do it right now because it did not freeze 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.350
 good as I have told you from time to time 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.350
 you have to remove the onion 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.320
 here 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.040
 and then we cover it again 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.709
 another detail one of the things that 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.180
 usually do is put the cheese on top of 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.160
 the hamburger while it's being done 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.230
 but if we want the hamburger to be 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.180
 at its point we will remove it immediately 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.530
 and then we will not have time for the 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.930
 cheese is undone what is it that we 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.150
 interesting so we 're going to put a 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.640
 a little while on the grill so that the onion 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.069
 caramelized fast and have a point 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.620
 sweet very nice let's use a 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.200
 little glass of pedro jimÃ©nez we raise the fire 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.420
 butt we add it until we remove 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.420
 be reduced well and the list is already 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.940
 let's go with the burgers there are 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.190
 keep trying the meat with a lot 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.600
 delicacy without pressing so 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.600
 we chop little by little 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.080
 Y 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.080
 dv 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.130
 Y 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.870
 we pepper 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.280
 Y 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.170
 and we have put the grill to heat 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.940
 about 10 minutes to butt 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.280
 we are interested in it being very very hot and 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.290
 we add the hamburger as you see the 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.540
 cheese is already melting and we're going to 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.640
 take a turn and we also flip the 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.060
 burgers and you know what you do 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.060
 taste 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.470
 and this is already hamburger that solange 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.880
 ter dan and the good onion I hope that you 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.880
 I liked a hug until then
