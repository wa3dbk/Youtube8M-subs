ready to create the first sketch in my
curved<00:00:19.960> spring<00:00:20.560> I'm<00:00:21.250> gonna<00:00:21.460> start<00:00:21.789> off<00:00:21.910> with<00:00:22.119> a

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
curved spring I'm gonna start off with a

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.550 
curved spring I'm gonna start off with a
long<00:00:22.810> thin<00:00:23.560> rectangle<00:00:25.050> I'm<00:00:26.050> gonna<00:00:26.259> use<00:00:26.529> a

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
long thin rectangle I'm gonna use a

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.620 
long thin rectangle I'm gonna use a
geometric<00:00:27.339> constraint<00:00:27.849> to<00:00:28.089> make<00:00:28.240> sure<00:00:28.449> that

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
geometric constraint to make sure that

I'm<00:02:14.400> gonna<00:02:14.489> create<00:02:14.850> another<00:02:14.910> sketch<00:02:15.570> we're

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
I'm gonna create another sketch we're

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.199 
I'm gonna create another sketch we're
going<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.470> end<00:02:16.620> up<00:02:16.680> using<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.130> bend<00:02:17.519> command

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
going to end up using the bend command

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.870 
going to end up using the bend command
in<00:02:18.390> order<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.870> create<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.350> curved<00:02:19.680> spring<00:02:20.220> and

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
start a sketch and I'll select the top

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.979 
start a sketch and I'll select the top
face<00:02:27.570> of<00:02:28.260> that<00:02:28.560> interior<00:02:29.010> feature<00:02:29.810> I'm<00:02:30.810> gonna

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
face of that interior feature I'm gonna

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.830 
face of that interior feature I'm gonna
look<00:02:31.170> at<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.440> top<00:02:31.709> view<00:02:32.130> of<00:02:32.190> this<00:02:32.600> now<00:02:33.600> when

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
look at the top view of this now when

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.069 
look at the top view of this now when
you<00:02:33.959> create<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.560> bend<00:02:34.860> line<00:02:35.190> there<00:02:36.000> is<00:02:36.269> a<00:02:36.299> very

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
you create the bend line there is a very

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.100 
you create the bend line there is a very
easy<00:02:37.410> mistake<00:02:37.799> or<00:02:38.630> pitfall<00:02:39.630> that<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:39.930> can

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
easy mistake or pitfall that you can

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.130 
easy mistake or pitfall that you can
fall<00:02:40.410> into<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:42.060> temptation<00:02:42.269> is<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:42.780> draw<00:02:43.079> the

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
fall into the temptation is to draw the

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.800 
fall into the temptation is to draw the
line<00:02:43.410> right<00:02:43.680> through<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.100> middle<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.459> the

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
now if I look at this carefully you can

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.050 
now if I look at this carefully you can
actually<00:02:50.130> see<00:02:50.310> that<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.579> line<00:02:50.790> does<00:02:51.030> not

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
actually see that the line does not

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.069 
actually see that the line does not
pierce<00:02:51.810> any<00:02:52.170> of<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.709> coil<00:02:53.010> feature<00:02:53.930> now<00:02:54.930> let

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:42.760 
if I go back to my coil feature I can
edit<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:39.860> feature<00:04:40.009> and<00:04:40.840> I<00:04:41.840> can<00:04:42.020> add<00:04:42.229> the<00:04:42.439> taper

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
edit the feature and I can add the taper

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.670 
edit the feature and I can add the taper
angle<00:04:43.099> to<00:04:43.490> the<00:04:43.610> original<00:04:44.030> coil<00:04:44.419> now<00:04:45.409> for<00:04:45.590> this

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
angle to the original coil now for this

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.649 
angle to the original coil now for this
example<00:04:46.099> I'll<00:04:46.430> use<00:04:46.460> five<00:04:46.969> degrees<00:04:49.509> here<00:04:50.509> you

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:50.659 
example I'll use five degrees here you

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:53.550 
example I'll use five degrees here you
can<00:04:50.810> see<00:04:51.050> the<00:04:51.500> curved<00:04:51.800> tapered<00:04:52.460> spring

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
can see the curved tapered spring

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.959 
can see the curved tapered spring
another<00:04:54.560> question<00:04:55.099> that<00:04:55.250> some<00:04:55.460> users<00:04:55.639> may

00:04:55.959 --> 00:04:55.969 
another question that some users may

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:58.510 
another question that some users may
have<00:04:56.180> is<00:04:56.419> is<00:04:56.780> it<00:04:56.930> possible<00:04:57.080> to<00:04:57.530> animate<00:04:58.069> the

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
have is is it possible to animate the

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.330 
have is is it possible to animate the
curved<00:04:58.759> spring<00:04:59.150> I'll<00:04:59.990> finish<00:05:00.440> off<00:05:00.770> this<00:05:01.069> tech

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
curved spring I'll finish off this tech

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.980 
curved spring I'll finish off this tech
tip<00:05:01.370> by<00:05:01.729> playing<00:05:02.030> you<00:05:02.150> a<00:05:02.210> video<00:05:02.599> of<00:05:02.659> an

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
tip by playing you a video of an

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.439 
tip by playing you a video of an
animation<00:05:03.530> of<00:05:03.860> the<00:05:03.979> spring<00:05:04.310> curving<00:05:04.849> and<00:05:05.000> to

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
animation of the spring curving and to

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:07.629 
animation of the spring curving and to
do<00:05:05.629> this<00:05:05.810> I<00:05:06.050> simply<00:05:06.409> animated<00:05:07.009> the<00:05:07.099> parameter

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
do this I simply animated the parameter

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:17.530 
do this I simply animated the parameter
that<00:05:07.819> controlled<00:05:08.210> the<00:05:08.300> radius<00:05:08.810> of<00:05:08.990> the<00:05:09.080> bend
