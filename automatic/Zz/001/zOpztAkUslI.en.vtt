a C or a D what we're facing here is

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.570 
a C or a D what we're facing here is
that<00:00:28.380> not<00:00:28.529> all<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.769> fat<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.220> put<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.490> the

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
that not all the fat that I put in the

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.950 
that not all the fat that I put in the
buttock<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:29.970> going<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.179> stay<00:00:30.420> some<00:00:30.720> one<00:00:30.840> will

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
buttock is going to stay some one will

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.630 
buttock is going to stay some one will
disappear<00:00:31.529> on<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.980> average<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.399> getting

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
disappear on the average of getting

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.510 
disappear on the average of getting
about<00:00:32.730> an<00:00:32.969> 80%<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.930> stay<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.920> some<00:00:35.219> people

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
about an 80% to stay and some people

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.490 
about an 80% to stay and some people
more<00:00:35.700> will<00:00:35.940> stay<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.450> others<00:00:36.690> less<00:00:36.989> will<00:00:37.290> stay

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
more will stay and others less will stay

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.580 
more will stay and others less will stay
so<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:39.180> we<00:00:39.390> don't<00:00:39.570> know<00:00:39.719> who<00:00:40.110> that's<00:00:40.290> going<00:00:40.530> to

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
so and we don't know who that's going to

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.319 
so and we don't know who that's going to
be<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.129> have<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.399> give<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.820> three<00:00:42.180> to

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
be in so we have to give it to three to

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.119 
be in so we have to give it to three to
six<00:00:42.600> months<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.020> see<00:00:43.290> how<00:00:43.320> much<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.710> its<00:00:43.860> state

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
six months to see how much of its state

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.600 
six months to see how much of its state
so<00:00:44.879> that's<00:00:45.090> our<00:00:45.270> first<00:00:45.510> issue<00:00:46.399> we<00:00:47.399> don't<00:00:47.550> know

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
so that's our first issue we don't know

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.190 
so that's our first issue we don't know
how<00:00:47.700> much<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:48.000> going<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.210> stay<00:00:48.420> number<00:00:48.719> two<00:00:49.020> is

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
how much is going to stay number two is

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.450 
how much is going to stay number two is
I<00:00:49.320> don't<00:00:49.379> know<00:00:49.500> how<00:00:49.590> much<00:00:49.739> body<00:00:49.980> fat<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.430> have
