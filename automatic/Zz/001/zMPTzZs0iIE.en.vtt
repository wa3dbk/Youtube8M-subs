00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 all comrade greetings to you, I 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.569
 laval 1 and heading what premium tank 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.059
 buy already ends with me on 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.080
 channel if we still have not considered something 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.139
 you can write it in the comments 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.420
 if this video has good reviews 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.670
 I made a couple more bonus issues 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.100
 your tank today i would like to 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.170
 consider premium tank t-34 drop 3 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.480
 which is the middle tank of the eighth 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.510
 Tier Chinese tank building 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.300
 is it worth it to buy to start 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.859
 it should be noted that the tank is very 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.469
 specific has of course good 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.700
 armored turret with as many as 190 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.399
 millimeters in the forehead 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.570
 but with instruments of dipping is only 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.399
 -3 grass 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.350
 which prevents most cases 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.480
 use the game through the tower for on 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.539
 the arrows of the cookies becomes very and 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.390
 very sad topic guns very sick 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.750
 for this device 390 average damage 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.149
 175 breakthroughs and scatter 046 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.969
 hundredths to 100 meters of course 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.230
 sad with all this stabilization 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.629
 on the go the worst 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.100
 yes and when you stop you have to wait not 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.850
 less than 3.4 for full details and 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.340
 nastrela 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.320
 Of course the numbers for the average tank 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.970
 just unimaginable 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.680
 when you hear the word middle 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.619
 Can you imagine how you will be dissected on 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.500
 speeds so 45 maybe even 50 kilometers 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.229
 and make everyone on the turntables but it's so not 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.450
 it will turn out even if you type the coveted 50 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.820
 kilometers which are written in tth that 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.030
 80 percent that from a distance of 100 meters 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.460
 you will not get the reservation of housing 90 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.619
 millimeters in the forehead and 50 in the sides of the art 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.009
 loves to show how she dominates 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.170
 you 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.360
 if you are immune to getting from 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.060
 artillery then in principle it should not 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.000
 affect the purchase of this unit but 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.840
 bake then you will still be me 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 sure of it 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.149
 that the reality of the tank is good and 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.640
 something like a legend type 59 like this 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.009
 low silhouette and good disguise 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.380
 two indicators that will help you though 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.219
 somehow align the statistics on this 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.230
 cars damage per minute as many as 1600 this 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.660
 general figure 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.790
 which is a very weak indicator i 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.940
 would even say one of the worst on 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:16.580
 eighth level premium tanks 100 you 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.920
 there will be 40 shells for 390 average damage 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.620
 each approximately equal to 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.050
 sixteen thousand damage which you 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.940
 will be able to realize for the fight but you need 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.460
 will shoot bye up to a full ten 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.890
 minutes to realize these all shells 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.110
 so this amount you just don't 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.270
 have time faster for the whole battle 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.730
 A review is a very important indicator for 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.770
 premium tanks so how much are you 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.260
 light on the middle tank can 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.390
 affect your earnings and thank you our 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.870
 armored and sighted towers in the whole 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.460
 three hundred eighty meters review if you 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.380
 love to devote then you can deliver 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.210
 enlightened optics or even an enemy 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.190
 but my preference for complicated 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.990
 equipment this rammer 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.420
 vertical alignment stabilizer and 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.280
 drives aiming stabilizer and 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.440
 rammer it is clear why we are long 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.930
 recharge and stabilization on the go 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.760
 terrible but why drives aiming 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.300
 everything is very simple as I said before 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.180
 3.4 seconds before full details 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.220
 it is an eternity for a medium tank therefore 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.230
 in order to reduce these difficult seconds 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.750
 you can put the ventilation of course 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.820
 with a good crew or just 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.970
 Simply drives aiming decide of course 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.070
 same thing you find you need to know 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.260
 The map has excellent positions for the game from 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.720
 tower but remember about the artillery in order 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.090
 anal sex does not spoil the farm and stand 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.190
 do not think on the caps 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.110
 no one can punch us in the first 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.750
 A number of how we armored rush give 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.880
 the tower is sewn often enough true 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.220
 in the top our tank shows very 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.930
 good results in the right hands 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.090
 but it's probably not even because 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.040
 he drags itself a unit 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.350
 just the inability of lower wreaths 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.770
 level to respond correctly situation 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.330
 what is happening in the high-level game 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.040
 farming is pretty good 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.830
 among all premium tanks of level 8 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.959
 somewhere in the middle by profitability but it 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.880
 profit will cost you blood and sweat 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.400
 even if we compare the statistics here 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.860
 replay the best figure in almost 90 by 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.560
 damage was 6 thousand damage when his 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.049
 zanurfili ny practice 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.919
 9 shows 7000 and it speaks only about 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:23.740
 one p30 4/3 is very difficult to master in 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.750
 the game is all I wanted to say 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.730
 this tank if you like the review 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.410
 you can like and drop to a friend 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.020
 who is sitting and thinking about what 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.760
 do not buy a premium tank or if you 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.690
 first time on my channel do not know 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.460
 subscribe 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.010
 it will be very very important to me 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.050
 Good luck to everyone on the battlefield and farm and

 watch my past video about how 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.040
 you need to bend over the bottom left platoon

 video go or change level 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.110
