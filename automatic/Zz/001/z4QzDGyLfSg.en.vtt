00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.819
 this is the story of a game full of 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.410
 dead within a genre that 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.599
 paradoxically it was dying a 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.610
 work that closed the glory era of the 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.799
 graphic adventures and went to stop at 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.890
 limbo of the games that never 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:21.680
 reedit but after 15 years 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.210
 traveling through purgatory comes back 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.210
 end green fandango 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:58.600
 in the fandango 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.510
 and there was a lot of desire for green fandango 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.270
 a game much loved by fans and 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.070
 pretty mistreated by the industry already 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.350
 in his time it was a kind of singing 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.080
 swan because the big business was 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.820
 moving away from the graphic adventures and 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.230
 what at the time were the jewels of 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.870
 the video game division of them 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.760
 lucas but these things are like that one day in 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.660
 the clouds and the day after the hole the 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.370
 death makes sad stories there is no evil 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.170
 that for good does not come because thanks to 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.330
 the disbanded of the studies of lukas 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.640
 team safer the director of l'infant and 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.650
 go 'he founded his own company he made games 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.390
 excellent and also has never stopped 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.570
 dream of the return of adventure 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.570
 graph 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.190
 because it has not been reissued before 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.410
 because it's still owned by lucas or 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.210
 be of disney so if there's fer and its 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.100
 team have had to give a lot to the 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.440
 hullabaloo to touch the material again 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.940
 original and fortunately have come to 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.280
 an agreement between all to re 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.210
 master it and launch it again in 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.350
 digital format 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.350
 good morning 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.069
 the original idea arose because to safer 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.230
 he liked the aesthetics of the day of the 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.480
 dead in Mexico and was interested in 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.730
 idea that many cultures bury you 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.770
 with money so that the spirits you 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.110
 help to travel through the other world where 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.600
 money and corruption so he thought that in 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.400
 the beyond there are also thieves and with 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.860
 these elements came a combination 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.440
 very original aesthetic join the folklore 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.970
 Mexican with black cinema 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.620
 Manny Calavera is a travel agent 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.480
 that helps the deceased to cross the 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.700
 land of the dead for a small 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.040
 commission is the typical gray man 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.920
 stuck in a boring job and over 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.930
 for all eternity but little by little 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.120
 is discovering that there is something strange in the 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.370
 system and that not everyone is wheat 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.410
 clean every dialogue seems taken out of a 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.569
 raymond chandler novel and many 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.450
 situations are winks to the classics of 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.730
 the 40s and 50s for example those owners 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.590
 of unscrupulous casinos that drove 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.840
 the roulettes from his office in 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.450
 movies like gilda 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.489
 care down there or the aesthetic and the 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.530
 port environment of having and not 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.140
 have and because not only questions to a 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.769
 sea bee 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.989
 and the bees of the game by the way are 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:24.200
 workers in the port and have a union 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:26.270
 that is governed by the law of silence 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.670
 the films of the 40 had to a 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.560
 actor who dominated absolutely everything 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.870
 so the main inspiration of 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.349
 l'infant tango is logically its best 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.569
 work 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:38.629
 play it again man and you'll skull a 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.700
 great bogart latino that rebels 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.810
 against those who want to take advantage of 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.310
 the weakest 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.769
 in the movie he deals with 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.269
 safe conduct and in the game with trips 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.550
 to cross the land of the dead 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:52.370
 we have a French police chief 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.890
 corrupt a cold and calculating character 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.769
 that leads to fez a pretty lorre peter 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.590
 more bony and a cafe where they are closed 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.210
 business very shady but always with 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.920
 elegance 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.200
 this new version is not a change 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.300
 radical the game is the same but with 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.710
 a small set- up have been 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.020
 remodeled the characters have been 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.600
 improved textures and lighting 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.820
 fits the character better within the 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.820
 scenario looks better but that's still 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.989
 luxury of 1998 as it said to brandon say it 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.610
 in the technical director of the 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.950
 remastering is a bit like 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.220
 to buy casablanca in blu-ray is that 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.220
 rhyme 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.380
 the music also sounds better because 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.180
 Peter Mcconnell has reviewed his 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.380
 original scores and has returned to 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.410
 record some with an orchestra 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.410
 symphonic 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.570
 and for the public of Spain it has been 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.150
 maintained the original dubbing that in its 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.920
 time was already pretty good I'll go 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.420
 here as soon as I can 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.910
 newroz llosa the dead ends 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.680
 and the people without resources like all that 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.500
 yes unfortunately this means 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.990
 that some fault has also been maintained 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.790
 of translation that still sounds very weird 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.860
 although in my heart being my 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.350
 secretary in the playable has not changed 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.480
 practically nothing are fixed planes and 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.760
 we interact with the moving stage 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.130
 the character who turns his head when 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.470
 there is some point of interest now man and 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.180
 walk directly to where you are leaning 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.130
 the control stick or what is a 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.390
 current control but if we want to continue 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.520
 being the option to handle it as 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.410
 before as if it were a tank and also 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.510
 for PC controls have been included 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.150
 of mouse more classic to point and do 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.160
 clicks 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.630
 the game preserves the best of 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.420
 graphic adventures that is that feeling 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.700
 of mystery of trying to solve several 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.590
 problems at the same time the moments of 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.840
 blockages are well distributed so that 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.760
 we scratch our heads and go to 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.580
 talk to all the characters to see 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.830
 if we missed something, yes 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.320
 a warning for those who have not played 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.720
 never the puzzles of most of the 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.700
 game they hold the guy well and it's more 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.590
 fun to play without looking at the solution 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.500
 on the internet but there is still some 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.570
 too dark moment and a couple of 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.180
 sites where control is not good 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:06.430
 refined and can confuse us when 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.770
 to solve a problem but I already say they are 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.750
 very specific cases in which you can 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:15.180
 make the exception of looking at a guide 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.180
 cats or again I'm sorry sir 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.139
 and fandangos has resurfaced in a good 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.090
 moment the graphic adventures are 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:25.889
 peeping through the head and 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.319
 doing what they do best 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:30.660
 good stories with good characters 

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:34.430
 it is a genre that was missed and 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.430
 let's hope he's back to stay
