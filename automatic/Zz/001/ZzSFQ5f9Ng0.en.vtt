00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.080 
should just swing and wrap right around
your<00:01:24.689> body<00:01:24.979> now<00:01:25.979> notice<00:01:26.369> what<00:01:26.520> I'm<00:01:26.640> doing<00:01:26.939> with

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
your body now notice what I'm doing with

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.870 
your body now notice what I'm doing with
my<00:01:27.299> head<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.710> don't<00:01:28.890> necessarily<00:01:29.040> have<00:01:29.640> to

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
my head so you don't necessarily have to

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.789 
my head so you don't necessarily have to
do<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.329> but<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.630> find<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.170> really<00:01:31.200> helps

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
do this but I find that it really helps

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.580 
do this but I find that it really helps
if<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.490> do<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.640> little<00:01:33.030> bit<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.659> head<00:01:33.840> roll<00:01:34.020> so

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
if you do a little bit of a head roll so

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.679 
if you do a little bit of a head roll so
you<00:01:34.619> can<00:01:34.860> just<00:01:35.100> practice<00:01:35.360> rolling<00:01:36.360> your<00:01:36.509> head

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
you can just practice rolling your head

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.069 
you can just practice rolling your head

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
nice and slow all the way across and

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.240 
nice and slow all the way across and
you're<00:01:40.200> going<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.380> do<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.710> right<00:01:40.979> at<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
you're going to do that right at the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.370 
you're going to do that right at the
point<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.670> let<00:01:41.909> go<00:01:42.240> just<00:01:42.600> kind<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.930> help<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
point you let go just kind of help the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.530 
point you let go just kind of help the
hoop<00:01:43.649> roll<00:01:43.829> around<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.399> actually<00:01:44.880> gives<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.299> a
