00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.160
 hello it's me simon dine must have done 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.360
 This video is about the topic 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.650
 Back training in another video 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.910
 I already told you how 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.870
 exhausting that it is actually the 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.429
 build up back 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.900
 Of course this should not discourage you completely 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.190
 On the contrary , really should only 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.600
 Show this is the right time 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.369
 is to start now 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.720
 Of course you can get the breast from 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.920
 maybe three or four months already 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.779
 build up pretty pompous 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.340
 the chest muscles are growing relatively 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.359
 quickly the back simply needs 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.980
 a little bit longer than usual 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.539
 a project over years but just the same 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.489
 It is also more important in the back 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.290
 long term because many 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.940
 strains hat just out of the back 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.770
 if it is a washing machine when moving 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.690
 Wear or if you just water boxes 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.129
 out of the car into the cellar they are carrying 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.079
 back muscles are actually always 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.190
 the decisive musculature so me 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.960
 show you in this video 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.670
 not only that you can be horizontal and 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.559
 should train vertically but in 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.570
 this video is about the pull-ups 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.340
 You can do general pull-ups everywhere 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.809
 make as a kind of devices 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.840
 you do not need it here either 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.010
 more than just the handle device there 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.090
 you can use different types of 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.440
 do pull-ups 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.449
 it is in this video I show 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.260
 just the classic ones 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.810
 pull-ups where you can assault 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.060
 grab either the spider monkey grip 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.770
 quite classic here just with the 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.259
 handle the palm and thumb on it 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.970
 take thumb or safety to the thumb 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.049
 the pole with glory always swing in 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.460
 a little bit more than shoulder width 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.200
 grab is already a very important 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.610
 thing so I just make time in 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.780
 monkeys grabbed I know that mine 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.540
 I can not touch it 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.450
 leave me and pretty much with the child 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.040
 over the bars yes then of course 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.420
 not important yet completely 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.400
 hang out that would be complete now 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.020
 hanged but a bit more 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.689
 tension and then again with the 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.270
 child about sexual assault as I said 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.009
 either spider monkey grip or am 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.840
 beginning with the 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.610
 dom around the city that you do not 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.350
 he slips out practicing the naturally white 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.130
 also that the coatis attacked just 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.750
 can grab 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.850
 important with something not to kiffen 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.500
 just use something completely different 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.210
 strain tender then you have the handle 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.770
 power already for develop and it can 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.840
 one simply by one without too 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.560
 then socialize and train 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.390
 Of course we have the 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.430
 possibility that not only upper handle 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.049
 to train but also under attack 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.910
 that is , so put into the city 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.390
 that usually a bit 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.250
 my biceps participation is easier 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.870
 You can also be relatively simple 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.910
 so pull up the burden it 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:22.160
 much easier you just 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.930
 not such a strong back participation 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.209
 because you get a lot more out of the biceps 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.709
 you might still know working when 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.480
 you somehow got close sooner than 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.010
 child to have pulled up was the 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.420
 always much easier than in the 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.040
 So the main idea is natural 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.260
 especially interesting for the beginners 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.780
 and a y still the other variant 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.709
 These are the person as you know 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.600
 that of course with these American 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.520
 film when they sit in the jail 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.959
 which one such a very special kind of 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.459
 The pull on such a thing 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.530
 device where the head held this 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.150
 the device enters the device 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.760
 the course you have to have for this is 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.070
 it takes out here and contracts with 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.870
 the neck respectively with the head here in 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.790
 this notch just to the sample 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.810
 two pieces right because you see what wants 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.810
 I mean that 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.600
 So not with the child over the bar 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.160
 but with your neck in this 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.450
 catch up race yes there you have to 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.680
 of course the device for have 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.600
 otherwise you can do that on everyone 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.100
 Children's playground can be done everywhere 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.019
 you really do not need it 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.310
 much just a solid rod 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.530
 there are also such devices for the 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.239
 doors and so on and so forth important 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.100
 is of course working with the handle 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.790
 wide and a bit wider 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.890
 to grab 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.110
 a little closer work cooperates 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.060
 the handle technique upper handle as well 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.820
 attacked different variants of the 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.489
 back is just a very complex structure 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:39.769
 atheism trapezoidal it naturally very a tus 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.150
 Rome where many other little ones start 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.340
 Of course all these muscles want 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.720
 that's what it takes to be stressed and irritated 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.340
 actually a good back training 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.019
 I hope I can see you in this video 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.060
 such a few tips as you could give 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.340
 With each of those pull-ups on everyone 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.570
 case back training very important from the 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.860
 move and you the power if you want 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.670
 I liked the video 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.320
 every rating 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.820
 See you in the next video many 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.820
 greetings from your simon
