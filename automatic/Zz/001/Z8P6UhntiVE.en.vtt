light or if the key light as you may
have<00:00:23.860> heard<00:00:24.610> it<00:00:24.730> called<00:00:24.970> the<00:00:25.720> main<00:00:26.020> light<00:00:26.320> is<00:00:26.349> a

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
have heard it called the main light is a

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.440 
have heard it called the main light is a
light<00:00:26.919> that<00:00:27.130> is<00:00:27.189> responsible<00:00:28.000> for<00:00:28.180> creating

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450 
light that is responsible for creating

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.620 
light that is responsible for creating
the<00:00:28.689> form<00:00:28.960> and<00:00:29.140> dimension<00:00:29.619> in<00:00:29.739> the<00:00:29.829> photograph

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
the form and dimension in the photograph

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.450 
the form and dimension in the photograph
this<00:00:31.630> is<00:00:31.689> the<00:00:31.899> light<00:00:32.200> that<00:00:32.529> creates<00:00:32.739> the<00:00:33.250> mood

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
this is the light that creates the mood

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.030 
this is the light that creates the mood
as<00:00:33.700> a<00:00:33.760> photographer<00:00:34.570> it's<00:00:35.050> your<00:00:35.320> job<00:00:35.649> to

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
as a photographer it's your job to

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.740 
as a photographer it's your job to
determine<00:00:36.460> what<00:00:37.179> the<00:00:37.329> mood<00:00:37.510> of<00:00:37.660> the

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
determine what the mood of the

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.569 
determine what the mood of the
photograph<00:00:38.199> is<00:00:38.350> going<00:00:38.500> to<00:00:38.559> be<00:00:38.739> when<00:00:39.280> you<00:00:39.399> make

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:39.579 
photograph is going to be when you make

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:40.889 
photograph is going to be when you make
a<00:00:39.609> decision<00:00:40.149> whether<00:00:40.269> you're<00:00:40.539> going<00:00:40.629> to<00:00:40.690> use<00:00:40.750> a

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
a decision whether you're going to use a

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.020 
a decision whether you're going to use a
parabolic<00:00:41.469> as<00:00:41.829> your<00:00:42.160> main<00:00:42.339> light<00:00:42.550> or<00:00:42.969> a

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
parabolic as your main light or a

parabolic as your main light or a
softbox<00:00:43.570> as<00:00:43.839> your<00:00:44.019> main<00:00:44.199> light<00:00:44.440> or<00:00:44.679> are<00:00:45.309> you

softbox as your main light or are you

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.189 
softbox as your main light or are you
going<00:00:45.550> to<00:00:45.640> use<00:00:45.760> a<00:00:45.789> grid<00:00:46.149> spot<00:00:46.480> for<00:00:46.899> your<00:00:46.989> main

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
going to use a grid spot for your main

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.380 
going to use a grid spot for your main
life<00:00:47.410> you're<00:00:47.949> just<00:00:47.980> making<00:00:48.579> a<00:00:48.670> decision<00:00:48.969> as<00:00:49.329> to

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
life you're just making a decision as to

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.239 
life you're just making a decision as to
what<00:00:49.929> the<00:00:50.140> mood<00:00:50.320> of<00:00:50.469> the<00:00:50.559> photograph<00:00:51.010> is<00:00:51.100> going

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:51.249 
what the mood of the photograph is going

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:53.579 
what the mood of the photograph is going
to<00:00:51.309> be<00:00:51.429> like<00:00:51.899> when<00:00:52.899> we're<00:00:53.079> going<00:00:53.199> when<00:00:53.410> we're

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589 
to be like when we're going when we're

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:56.819 
to be like when we're going when we're
talking<00:00:53.890> about<00:00:53.980> in<00:00:54.190> our<00:00:54.280> tutorials<00:00:55.620> -<00:00:56.620> one

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
talking about in our tutorials - one

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.560 
talking about in our tutorials - one
stop<00:00:57.129> -<00:00:58.089> two<00:00:58.300> stops<00:00:58.629> plus<00:00:59.079> one<00:00:59.320> stop<00:01:00.570> every

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
stop - two stops plus one stop every

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.959 
stop - two stops plus one stop every
light<00:01:01.899> in<00:01:02.170> the<00:01:02.379> set<00:01:02.649> is<00:01:02.859> based<00:01:03.309> off<00:01:03.579> of<00:01:03.640> our

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
light in the set is based off of our

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:05.970 
light in the set is based off of our
main<00:01:04.180> light<00:01:04.449> so<00:01:05.230> if<00:01:05.320> we're<00:01:05.470> talking<00:01:05.740> about<00:01:05.860> a

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:05.980 
main light so if we're talking about a

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.170 
main light so if we're talking about a
hair<00:01:06.190> light<00:01:06.400> and<00:01:06.550> we<00:01:06.610> say<00:01:06.790> that<00:01:06.940> the<00:01:07.030> hair

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
hair light and we say that the hair

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.810 
hair light and we say that the hair
lights<00:01:07.390> -<00:01:07.870> one<00:01:08.110> stop<00:01:08.439> that<00:01:08.799> means<00:01:08.979> it's<00:01:09.189> -<00:01:09.579> it's

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
lights - one stop that means it's - it's

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.910 
lights - one stop that means it's - it's
one<00:01:10.149> stop<00:01:10.390> less<00:01:10.810> exposure<00:01:11.290> than<00:01:11.590> the<00:01:11.740> main

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
one stop less exposure than the main

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.130 
one stop less exposure than the main
light<00:01:12.100> because<00:01:13.000> the<00:01:13.119> main<00:01:13.329> light<00:01:13.540> or<00:01:13.840> the<00:01:13.960> key

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
light because the main light or the key

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.440 
light because the main light or the key
light<00:01:14.409> is<00:01:14.619> that<00:01:14.950> the<00:01:15.369> light<00:01:15.700> that<00:01:15.909> we<00:01:16.180> base

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
light is that the light that we base

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.050 
light is that the light that we base
every<00:01:16.990> exposure<00:01:17.350> in<00:01:17.619> the<00:01:17.740> set<00:01:17.950> off<00:01:18.100> of<00:01:18.369> we<00:01:18.880> base

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
every exposure in the set off of we base

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.910 
every exposure in the set off of we base
a<00:01:19.090> fill<00:01:19.450> light<00:01:19.689> our<00:01:20.200> hair<00:01:20.439> lights<00:01:20.710> our

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
a fill light our hair lights our

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.289 
a fill light our hair lights our
background<00:01:21.369> lights<00:01:21.579> our<00:01:21.759> edge<00:01:21.969> lights

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
background lights our edge lights

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.840 
background lights our edge lights
everything<00:01:22.960> exposure<00:01:23.530> is<00:01:23.710> based<00:01:23.950> off<00:01:24.219> of<00:01:24.250> the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
everything exposure is based off of the

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.810 
everything exposure is based off of the
main<00:01:25.329> light<00:01:25.860> now<00:01:26.860> our<00:01:27.040> main<00:01:27.310> light<00:01:27.520> can<00:01:27.700> be

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
main light now our main light can be

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.450 
main light now our main light can be
very<00:01:28.030> hard<00:01:28.329> like<00:01:29.049> this<00:01:29.229> parabolic<00:01:30.040> that<00:01:30.340> we've

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
very hard like this parabolic that we've

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.920 
very hard like this parabolic that we've
got<00:01:30.670> here<00:01:30.850> today<00:01:31.000> or<00:01:31.360> it<00:01:31.479> could<00:01:31.630> be<00:01:31.719> a<00:01:31.750> very

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
got here today or it could be a very

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.590 
got here today or it could be a very
soft<00:01:32.259> light<00:01:32.530> source<00:01:32.969> that's<00:01:33.969> what<00:01:34.149> we<00:01:34.270> have<00:01:34.450> to

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
soft light source that's what we have to

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.870 
soft light source that's what we have to
decide<00:01:34.930> so<00:01:35.259> let's<00:01:35.500> talk<00:01:36.070> a<00:01:36.130> minute<00:01:36.369> for<00:01:36.700> about

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
decide so let's talk a minute for about

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.670 
decide so let's talk a minute for about
the<00:01:37.060> main<00:01:37.270> light<00:01:37.479> and<00:01:37.810> this<00:01:38.560> is<00:01:38.829> a<00:01:39.340> very<00:01:39.880> hard

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
the main light and this is a very hard

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.429 
the main light and this is a very hard
light<00:01:41.680> source<00:01:42.600> it's<00:01:43.600> when<00:01:43.719> you<00:01:43.840> turn<00:01:44.110> to<00:01:44.289> me

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
light source it's when you turn to me

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:45.810 
light source it's when you turn to me
just<00:01:44.680> a<00:01:44.740> little<00:01:44.950> bit<00:01:45.070> and<00:01:45.159> you<00:01:45.219> can<00:01:45.340> see<00:01:45.579> by<00:01:45.759> the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
just a little bit and you can see by the

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.230 
just a little bit and you can see by the
by<00:01:46.479> the<00:01:47.430> transition<00:01:48.430> from<00:01:48.579> highlights<00:01:49.060> to

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
by the transition from highlights to

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.620 
by the transition from highlights to
shadows<00:01:50.189> on<00:01:51.189> her<00:01:51.250> face<00:01:51.670> how<00:01:52.030> hard<00:01:52.359> that<00:01:52.570> is

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
shadows on her face how hard that is

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.459 
shadows on her face how hard that is
that's<00:01:52.990> a<00:01:53.109> very<00:01:53.469> very<00:01:53.799> hard<00:01:54.219> light<00:01:54.490> source<00:01:55.469> so

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
that's a very very hard light source so

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:57.510 
that's a very very hard light source so
I'm<00:01:56.530> going<00:01:56.649> to<00:01:56.710> turn<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:56.920> overhead<00:01:57.250> lights

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
I'm going to turn the overhead lights

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.789 
I'm going to turn the overhead lights
off<00:01:57.729> just<00:01:57.759> a<00:01:58.390> second<00:01:59.109> here<00:01:59.229> so<00:01:59.380> you<00:01:59.469> can<00:01:59.590> see

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
off just a second here so you can see

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.800 
off just a second here so you can see
that<00:01:59.979> a<00:02:00.009> little<00:02:00.189> better<00:02:00.399> so<00:02:01.210> that's<00:02:01.359> a<00:02:01.509> very

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
that a little better so that's a very

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.660 
that a little better so that's a very
very<00:02:02.170> hard<00:02:02.439> light<00:02:02.679> source<00:02:02.979> and<00:02:03.219> we're<00:02:03.340> making

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
very hard light source and we're making

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.609 
very hard light source and we're making
a<00:02:03.729> decision<00:02:03.880> that<00:02:04.210> we<00:02:04.479> want<00:02:04.719> a<00:02:04.810> more<00:02:05.020> graphic

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
a decision that we want a more graphic

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.040 
a decision that we want a more graphic
photograph<00:02:06.130> if<00:02:06.369> we<00:02:06.880> use<00:02:07.090> a<00:02:07.119> very<00:02:07.450> small<00:02:07.570> light

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
photograph if we use a very small light

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.740 
photograph if we use a very small light
source<00:02:08.380> but<00:02:09.369> one<00:02:09.640> of<00:02:09.789> the<00:02:09.850> most<00:02:10.060> popular<00:02:10.539> light

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
source but one of the most popular light

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.800 
source but one of the most popular light
sources<00:02:11.110> today<00:02:11.380> is<00:02:11.830> probably<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.430> softbox<00:02:13.030> so

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
sources today is probably the softbox so

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.180 
sources today is probably the softbox so
for<00:02:14.020> today's<00:02:14.290> tutorial<00:02:14.530> we're<00:02:14.980> going<00:02:15.130> to

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
for today's tutorial we're going to

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.940 
for today's tutorial we're going to
photograph<00:02:15.610> on<00:02:15.820> this<00:02:15.970> with<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.510> softbox

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
photograph on this with the softbox

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.500 
photograph on this with the softbox
so<00:02:18.370> let's<00:02:18.580> go<00:02:18.700> ahead<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:18.910> get<00:02:19.060> rid<00:02:19.240> of<00:02:19.300> this

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
so let's go ahead and get rid of this

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.589 
so let's go ahead and get rid of this
very<00:02:19.750> hard<00:02:20.020> light<00:02:20.260> source<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:22.209> put<00:02:22.480> our

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
very hard light source and put our

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.510 
very hard light source and put our
softbox<00:02:23.140> on<00:02:23.349> and<00:02:23.500> see<00:02:23.620> what<00:02:23.770> happens<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.400> the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
softbox on and see what happens to the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.870 
softbox on and see what happens to the
quality<00:02:25.090> of<00:02:25.270> our<00:02:25.840> light<00:02:29.220> so<00:02:30.220> now<00:02:30.430> we've<00:02:30.670> got

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
quality of our light so now we've got

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.100 
quality of our light so now we've got
the<00:02:31.000> softbox<00:02:31.450> on<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:33.480> for<00:02:34.480> today's<00:02:34.750> we're

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
the softbox on and for today's we're

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.750 
the softbox on and for today's we're
gonna<00:02:35.230> work<00:02:35.470> with<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.739> softbox<00:02:36.190> of<00:02:36.400> our<00:02:36.520> main

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
gonna work with the softbox of our main

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.610 
gonna work with the softbox of our main
light<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.300> talk<00:02:37.690> about<00:02:37.810> proper<00:02:38.319> placement

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
light and talk about proper placement

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.900 
light and talk about proper placement
and<00:02:39.010> how<00:02:39.220> we<00:02:39.280> use<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.819> softbox<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:41.790> as<00:02:42.790> you

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
and how we use the softbox and as you

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.430 
and how we use the softbox and as you
can<00:02:43.060> see<00:02:43.120> immediately<00:02:43.720> we've<00:02:43.930> got<00:02:44.110> a<00:02:44.140> much

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
can see immediately we've got a much

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.009 
can see immediately we've got a much
softer<00:02:44.830> gentler<00:02:45.610> light<00:02:46.120> which<00:02:46.420> is<00:02:46.569> much<00:02:46.780> more

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
softer gentler light which is much more

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.890 
softer gentler light which is much more
flattering<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.590> most<00:02:47.920> subjects<00:02:48.519> and<00:02:48.970> if<00:02:49.780> you

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
flattering to most subjects and if you

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.300 
flattering to most subjects and if you
