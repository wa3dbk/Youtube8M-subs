I'll<00:02:33.180> see<00:02:33.390> now<00:02:33.570> it<00:02:33.690> was<00:02:33.810> on<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:34.260> tee<00:02:34.410> 7<00:02:35.130> so<00:02:35.280> it

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
I'll see now it was on a tee 7 so it

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.960 
I'll see now it was on a tee 7 so it
changed<00:02:35.700> 897<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.690> better<00:02:37.080> change<00:02:37.320> it<00:02:37.500> back<00:02:37.970> to

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
changed 897 I better change it back to

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:57.270 
changed 897 I better change it back to
900<00:02:39.570> or<00:02:39.690> I'll<00:02:39.840> be<00:02:40.050> all<00:02:40.200> messed<00:02:40.500> up

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.770 

and<00:02:58.280> not<00:02:58.610> that<00:02:58.760> it<00:02:58.909> makes<00:02:59.030> a<00:02:59.209> difference<00:02:59.239> but

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
and not that it makes a difference but

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.960 
and not that it makes a difference but
when<00:02:59.989> Dale<00:03:00.170> jr.<00:03:00.530> raced<00:03:00.799> on<00:03:01.159> here<00:03:01.580> he<00:03:01.819> was

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
when Dale jr. raced on here he was

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.660 
when Dale jr. raced on here he was
racing<00:03:02.239> on<00:03:02.330> here<00:03:02.510> quite<00:03:02.930> a<00:03:02.959> bit<00:03:03.459> through<00:03:04.459> four

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
racing on here quite a bit through four

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.170 
racing on here quite a bit through four
years<00:03:04.819> ago<00:03:05.030> and<00:03:06.610> these<00:03:07.610> are<00:03:07.849> the<00:03:07.940> settings

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
years ago and these are the settings

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.479 
years ago and these are the settings
that<00:03:08.390> he<00:03:08.629> used<00:03:08.930> so<00:03:09.530> that<00:03:09.950> doesn't<00:03:10.190> mean<00:03:10.430> that

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
that he used so that doesn't mean that

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.390 
that he used so that doesn't mean that
they're<00:03:10.790> good<00:03:11.000> or<00:03:11.330> the<00:03:11.420> rider<00:03:11.750> but<00:03:12.379> most<00:03:13.250> of

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
they're good or the rider but most of

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.330 
they're good or the rider but most of
the<00:03:13.459> pro<00:03:13.730> racers<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.959> pro<00:03:15.590> guys<00:03:15.799> that<00:03:16.069> are<00:03:16.190> on

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
the pro racers the pro guys that are on

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.979 
the pro racers the pro guys that are on
here<00:03:16.610> hat<00:03:17.030> do<00:03:17.420> use<00:03:17.720> these<00:03:17.930> settings<00:03:18.579> so<00:03:19.579> that's

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
here hat do use these settings so that's

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.539 
here hat do use these settings so that's
just<00:03:20.989> a<00:03:21.079> little<00:03:21.230> confirmation<00:03:21.650> for<00:03:22.129> me<00:03:22.159> that

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
just a little confirmation for me that

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.030 
just a little confirmation for me that
that<00:03:22.879> down<00:03:23.209> here<00:03:23.390> on<00:03:23.480> force-feedback

that down here on force-feedback

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.530 
that down here on force-feedback
obviously<00:03:25.040> enable<00:03:25.370> force<00:03:25.579> feedback<00:03:25.819> strength

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
obviously enable force feedback strength

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.900 
obviously enable force feedback strength

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
this at fifteen or twenty I don't like

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.670 
this at fifteen or twenty I don't like
that<00:03:40.670> much<00:03:40.879> force<00:03:41.239> I<00:03:41.540> don't<00:03:41.569> my<00:03:42.170> monitors

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
that much force I don't my monitors

that much force I don't my monitors
aren't<00:03:42.859> too<00:03:43.040> stable<00:03:43.489> so<00:03:43.670> a<00:03:43.700> lot<00:03:43.940> of<00:03:44.060> force

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.670 
aren't too stable so a lot of force
really<00:03:44.569> shakes<00:03:44.840> my<00:03:44.989> monitors<00:03:45.470> up<00:03:45.680> but<00:03:46.060> I<00:03:47.680> find

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
really shakes my monitors up but I find

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.080 
really shakes my monitors up but I find

that this right here works for me for

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
pressure there's a little spot at the

pressure there's a little spot at the

top or it doesn't catch a lot of people
will<00:04:27.289> either<00:04:27.470> raise<00:04:27.800> this<00:04:28.010> number<00:04:28.070> up<00:04:29.229> but

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
will either raise this number up but

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.320 
will either raise this number up but
another<00:04:30.590> way<00:04:30.800> to<00:04:30.860> do<00:04:31.190> it<00:04:31.220> is<00:04:31.490> to<00:04:31.760> turn<00:04:32.120> your

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
another way to do it is to turn your

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.640 
another way to do it is to turn your
centering<00:04:32.750> spring<00:04:33.110> on<00:04:33.320> in<00:04:33.590> your<00:04:34.160> profiler<00:04:34.760> and

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
centering spring on in your profiler and

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.050 
centering spring on in your profiler and
set<00:04:36.650> it<00:04:36.770> up<00:04:36.889> to<00:04:37.099> around<00:04:37.190> one<00:04:37.550> hundred<00:04:37.789> and<00:04:37.849> five

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
set it up to around one hundred and five

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.580 
set it up to around one hundred and five
hundred<00:04:38.510> and<00:04:38.599> fifteen<00:04:39.050> and<00:04:39.620> that<00:04:40.400> will<00:04:41.590> for

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
hundred and fifteen and that will for

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.589 
hundred and fifteen and that will for
the<00:04:42.680> most<00:04:42.889> part<00:04:43.160> take<00:04:43.430> that<00:04:43.669> pressure<00:04:44.449> out

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
the most part take that pressure out

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:46.570 
the most part take that pressure out
there's<00:04:45.199> probably<00:04:45.620> other<00:04:45.770> ways<00:04:45.860> to<00:04:46.130> do<00:04:46.280> it<00:04:46.310> but

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
there's probably other ways to do it but

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.930 
there's probably other ways to do it but
that's<00:04:46.970> the<00:04:47.120> way<00:04:47.240> I<00:04:47.270> did<00:04:48.340> but<00:04:49.340> I<00:04:49.460> turn<00:04:49.639> it<00:04:49.789> off

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
that's the way I did but I turn it off

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.210 
that's the way I did but I turn it off
when<00:04:50.210> I<00:04:50.240> am<00:04:50.510> running<00:04:50.930> ovals<00:04:51.410> because<00:04:51.830> a<00:04:51.860> lot<00:04:52.190> of

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
when I am running ovals because a lot of

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.089 
when I am running ovals because a lot of
times<00:04:52.490> that<00:04:52.699> extra<00:04:53.330> force<00:04:53.570> is<00:04:53.840> just<00:04:54.080> it<00:04:54.349> it's

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
times that extra force is just it it's

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:58.900 
times that extra force is just it it's
hard<00:04:55.460> hurts<00:04:56.210> your<00:04:56.360> hand<00:04:56.570> and<00:04:56.900> your<00:04:57.050> arm<00:04:57.910> but

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
hard hurts your hand and your arm but

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.589 
hard hurts your hand and your arm but
that's<00:04:59.150> just<00:04:59.300> me<00:05:00.010> but<00:05:01.010> the<00:05:01.940> rest<00:05:02.120> of<00:05:02.300> is<00:05:02.389> pretty

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:02.599 
that's just me but the rest of is pretty

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:04.510 
that's just me but the rest of is pretty
much<00:05:02.750> basic<00:05:03.199> you<00:05:03.349> probably<00:05:03.860> the<00:05:03.979> same<00:05:04.190> as<00:05:04.370> what

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
much basic you probably the same as what

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.320 
much basic you probably the same as what
you<00:05:04.550> have<00:05:04.880> and

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.520 

so<00:05:09.169> that's<00:05:09.350> it<00:05:09.560> I<00:05:09.590> hope<00:05:09.860> it<00:05:10.100> helps
