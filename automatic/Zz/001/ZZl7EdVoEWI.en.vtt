on<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:15.000> vac<00:00:15.599> master<00:00:16.049> sous-vide<00:00:16.440> machine<00:00:16.500> I

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
on a vac master sous-vide machine I

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.859 
on a vac master sous-vide machine I
think<00:00:17.310> its<00:00:17.550> new<00:00:17.699> on<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.910> market<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.449> kind<00:00:18.840> of

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
think its new on the market I kind of

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.210 
think its new on the market I kind of
look<00:00:19.020> around<00:00:19.140> on<00:00:19.350> YouTube<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.890> for

information on this thing I couldn't

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.750 
information on this thing I couldn't
really<00:00:22.140> find<00:00:22.380> much<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.100> thought<00:00:23.519> I'd<00:00:23.670> do

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
really find much so I thought I'd do

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.519 
really find much so I thought I'd do
this<00:00:23.939> review<00:00:24.090> for<00:00:24.269> all<00:00:24.600> those<00:00:24.840> interested<00:00:25.439> in

this review for all those interested in

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.620 
this review for all those interested in
it<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.859> picked<00:00:26.519> myself<00:00:26.699> up<00:00:27.029> one<00:00:27.240> let's<00:00:27.449> take<00:00:27.599> a

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
it I picked myself up one let's take a

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.120 
it I picked myself up one let's take a
look

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
look

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.160 
look
so<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.640> be<00:00:29.760> like<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.029> unboxing<00:00:30.720> part<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.109> the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
so this be like the unboxing part of the

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.700 
so this be like the unboxing part of the
show<00:00:31.430> I've<00:00:32.430> kind<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:32.969> waited<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.540> do<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:34.170> I

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
show I've kind of waited to do this so I

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.620 
show I've kind of waited to do this so I
did<00:00:35.100> take<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.370> peek<00:00:35.640> inside<00:00:35.850> just<00:00:36.270> kind<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.510> know

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
did take a peek inside just kind of know

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.990 
did take a peek inside just kind of know
what<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.110> was<00:00:37.350> getting<00:00:37.469> into<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:38.070> basically

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
what I was getting into so basically

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.850 
what I was getting into so basically
when<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.239> get<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.540> you'll<00:00:40.079> get<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.530> box<00:00:41.270> with

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
when you get it you'll get a box with

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.290 
when you get it you'll get a box with
instructions<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.129> don't<00:00:44.309> know<00:00:44.430> why<00:00:44.910> they<00:00:45.090> put

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
instructions I don't know why they put

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.010 
instructions I don't know why they put
these<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:45.660> here

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
these in here

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.540 
these in here
then<00:00:46.559> don't<00:00:46.800> read<00:00:46.980> them<00:00:47.750> so<00:00:49.070> okay<00:00:50.070> pop<00:00:50.399> this

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
then don't read them so okay pop this

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.889 
then don't read them so okay pop this
out<00:00:55.340> set<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.460> Box<00:00:56.699> aside<00:00:56.879> get<00:00:57.449> an<00:00:57.600> Allen

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
out set the Box aside get an Allen

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.010 
out set the Box aside get an Allen
wrench<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:58.890> will<00:00:59.270> soon<00:01:00.270> figure<00:01:00.600> out<00:01:00.809> what

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
wrench that we will soon figure out what

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.470 
wrench that we will soon figure out what
this<00:01:01.170> does<00:01:02.090> without<00:01:03.090> reading<00:01:03.390> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
this does without reading the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.210 
this does without reading the
instructions<00:01:04.049> hopefully<00:01:06.799> looks<00:01:07.799> like<00:01:07.979> pretty

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
instructions hopefully looks like pretty

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.850 
instructions hopefully looks like pretty
decent<00:01:08.640> packaging<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:10.320> machine<00:01:10.710> in

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
decent packaging and this machine in

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.660 
decent packaging and this machine in
comparison<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.990> one<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:13.950> have<00:01:14.189> by<00:01:14.369> Poly

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
comparison to the one I have by Poly

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.679 
comparison to the one I have by Poly
science<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.420> little<00:01:16.110> larger<00:01:17.330> shorter<00:01:18.330> but

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
science is a little larger shorter but

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.740 
science is a little larger shorter but
wider<00:01:22.759> appears<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> little<00:01:24.479> scratched

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
wider appears to be a little scratched

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.830 
wider appears to be a little scratched
up<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.320> top<00:01:26.090> perhaps<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.270> was<00:01:27.390> previously

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
up on the top perhaps it was previously

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.899 
up on the top perhaps it was previously
owned<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.200> did<00:01:28.350> get<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.619> on<00:01:28.770> Amazon<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.490> who

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
owned I did get this on Amazon so who

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.249 
owned I did get this on Amazon so who
knows<00:01:30.119> what<00:01:30.479> could<00:01:30.659> happen<00:01:30.840> there<00:01:32.570> yeah<00:01:33.570> looks

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
knows what could happen there yeah looks

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.310 
knows what could happen there yeah looks
like<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.409> nice<00:01:34.590> little<00:01:34.619> unit<00:01:35.930> so<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.020> looks<00:01:37.200> like

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
like a nice little unit so it looks like

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.890 
like a nice little unit so it looks like
you<00:01:37.530> can<00:01:37.860> adjust<00:01:38.369> your<00:01:38.430> water<00:01:39.150> temperature<00:01:39.390> as

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
you can adjust your water temperature as

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.859 
you can adjust your water temperature as
well<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.890> has<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.070> timer<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.450> can<00:01:42.600> switch

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
well it has a timer and you can switch

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.020 
well it has a timer and you can switch
from<00:01:44.090> Celsius<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.119> Fahrenheit<00:01:46.759> just<00:01:47.759> looking

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
from Celsius to Fahrenheit just looking

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.560 
from Celsius to Fahrenheit just looking
around

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
around

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.899 
around
I<00:01:48.689> can't<00:01:49.049> tell<00:01:49.320> still<00:01:49.920> what<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.579> allen

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
I can't tell still what that allen

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.840 
I can't tell still what that allen
wrench<00:01:51.149> could<00:01:51.390> be<00:01:51.509> for<00:01:51.720> except<00:01:52.079> for<00:01:52.110> perhaps

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
wrench could be for except for perhaps

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.069 
wrench could be for except for perhaps
cleaning<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.939> unit<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.390> does<00:01:54.600> appear<00:01:55.049> that

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
cleaning the unit it does appear that

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.950 
cleaning the unit it does appear that
down<00:01:55.950> here<00:01:56.310> there<00:01:57.119> are<00:01:57.270> these<00:01:57.390> four<00:01:57.600> allen

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
down here there are these four allen

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.990 
down here there are these four allen
screws<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.380> can<00:01:58.439> disassemble<00:01:59.280> this<00:01:59.490> unit<00:01:59.850> and

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
screws you can disassemble this unit and

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.359 
screws you can disassemble this unit and
clean<00:02:00.450> out<00:02:00.630> your<00:02:00.659> circulator<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.829> the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
clean out your circulator and the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.920 
clean out your circulator and the
heating<00:02:02.909> element<00:02:03.840> there<00:02:04.020> what's<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:04.799> here

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
heating element there what's in here

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.820 
heating element there what's in here
okay<00:02:06.930> this<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:09.349> probably

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
okay this is probably

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.710 
okay this is probably
a<00:02:12.840> reset<00:02:13.840> for<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.200> fuse<00:02:14.650> or<00:02:14.860> something<00:02:15.040> in<00:02:15.720> there

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
a reset for a fuse or something in there

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.190 
a reset for a fuse or something in there
I<00:02:16.960> don't<00:02:17.530> know<00:02:18.390> I'll<00:02:19.390> annotate<00:02:19.750> it<00:02:20.020> because

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
I don't know I'll annotate it because

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.450 
I don't know I'll annotate it because
I'll<00:02:20.350> probably<00:02:20.650> end<00:02:20.980> up<00:02:21.100> reading<00:02:21.370> the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
I'll probably end up reading the

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.260 
I'll probably end up reading the
instructions<00:02:21.970> so<00:02:22.420> anyway<00:02:23.250> let's<00:02:24.250> get<00:02:25.060> this

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
instructions so anyway let's get this

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.690 
instructions so anyway let's get this
guy<00:02:26.040> set<00:02:27.040> up<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.400> put<00:02:27.760> in<00:02:28.110> some<00:02:29.110> water<00:02:29.380> I<00:02:29.700> have

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
guy set up and put in some water I have

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.970 
guy set up and put in some water I have
over<00:02:31.030> here<00:02:31.860> we'll<00:02:32.860> just<00:02:33.010> set<00:02:33.190> it<00:02:33.310> up<00:02:33.400> I<00:02:34.980> have

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
over here we'll just set it up I have

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.300 
over here we'll just set it up I have
about<00:02:36.540> as<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:37.660> can<00:02:37.780> see<00:02:37.960> here<00:02:38.230> about<00:02:38.320> three

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
about as you can see here about three

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.870 
about as you can see here about three
gallons<00:02:39.640> of<00:02:39.760> water<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:41.520> I<00:02:42.520> just<00:02:42.550> kind<00:02:42.850> of

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
gallons of water and I just kind of

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:50.190 
gallons of water and I just kind of
thought<00:02:43.150> I'd<00:02:43.360> do<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:43.900> test<00:02:46.140> see<00:02:47.140> how<00:02:47.230> long<00:02:49.200> see

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
thought I'd do a test see how long see

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.490 
thought I'd do a test see how long see
that's<00:02:51.040> not<00:02:51.190> up<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.370> my<00:02:51.550> minimum<00:02:51.910> marker<00:02:52.330> so<00:02:53.110> it

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
that's not up to my minimum marker so it

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.660 
that's not up to my minimum marker so it
looks<00:02:53.680> like<00:02:53.770> it's<00:02:53.890> going<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.040> be<00:02:54.130> about<00:02:54.250> four

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
looks like it's going to be about four

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.430 
looks like it's going to be about four
gallons<00:02:55.060> of<00:02:55.150> water<00:02:55.300> in<00:02:55.570> this<00:02:55.720> particular<00:02:56.080> unit

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
gallons of water in this particular unit

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.860 
gallons of water in this particular unit
to<00:02:56.800> make<00:02:57.430> it<00:02:57.580> up<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.820> the<00:02:57.910> minimum<00:02:58.180> let<00:02:58.660> me<00:02:58.750> get

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
to make it up to the minimum let me get

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.680 
to make it up to the minimum let me get
this<00:02:58.959> filled<00:02:59.230> up<00:02:59.410> we'll<00:03:00.040> start<00:03:00.280> this<00:03:00.430> test<00:03:00.690> ok

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
this filled up we'll start this test ok

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.840 
this filled up we'll start this test ok
guys<00:03:01.870> so<00:03:02.080> I<00:03:02.110> have<00:03:02.410> filled<00:03:03.070> up<00:03:03.250> this<00:03:03.430> thing<00:03:03.670> and

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
guys so I have filled up this thing and

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.340 
guys so I have filled up this thing and
in<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.000> process<00:03:04.510> of<00:03:04.660> filling<00:03:04.870> it<00:03:05.050> up<00:03:05.140> I

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
in the process of filling it up I

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.350 
in the process of filling it up I
noticed<00:03:05.980> that<00:03:06.310> on<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.520> back<00:03:06.730> here<00:03:07.030> remember

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
noticed that on the back here remember

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.820 
noticed that on the back here remember
if<00:03:07.420> you<00:03:07.480> guys<00:03:07.570> see<00:03:07.930> this<00:03:08.080> but<00:03:08.350> there's<00:03:08.800> a

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
if you guys see this but there's a

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.030 
if you guys see this but there's a
little<00:03:08.920> button<00:03:09.340> here<00:03:09.550> in<00:03:10.240> a<00:03:10.440> like<00:03:11.440> a<00:03:11.470> section

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
little button here in a like a section

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.370 
little button here in a like a section
of<00:03:12.160> like<00:03:12.370> track<00:03:13.209> almost<00:03:13.660> looking<00:03:13.900> stuff<00:03:14.140> so

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
of like track almost looking stuff so

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.970 
of like track almost looking stuff so
thinking<00:03:15.130> what<00:03:15.340> I<00:03:15.370> thought<00:03:16.590> push<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.709> button

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
thinking what I thought push the button

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.729 
thinking what I thought push the button
and<00:03:18.220> golly<00:03:19.030> gosh<00:03:19.570> darn<00:03:19.989> look<00:03:20.290> at<00:03:20.410> that<00:03:20.530> it

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
and golly gosh darn look at that it

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.400 
and golly gosh darn look at that it
slides<00:03:21.070> right<00:03:21.370> down<00:03:21.430> so<00:03:21.940> it<00:03:22.450> does<00:03:22.690> have<00:03:23.080> an

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
slides right down so it does have an

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.340 
slides right down so it does have an
adjustable<00:03:24.070> height<00:03:25.140> so<00:03:26.140> you<00:03:26.530> can<00:03:27.070> use<00:03:27.310> shower

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
adjustable height so you can use shower

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.949 
adjustable height so you can use shower
kind<00:03:29.350> of<00:03:29.470> vessels<00:03:30.090> for<00:03:31.090> your<00:03:31.209> immersion<00:03:31.600> so

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
kind of vessels for your immersion so

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.490 
kind of vessels for your immersion so
anyway<00:03:32.769> that's<00:03:33.519> found<00:03:33.850> out<00:03:34.080> and<00:03:35.080> I<00:03:35.230> did<00:03:35.410> it

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
anyway that's found out and I did it

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.509 
anyway that's found out and I did it
without<00:03:35.590> instructions

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
without instructions

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.660 
without instructions
alright<00:03:37.620> let's<00:03:38.620> start<00:03:38.860> this<00:03:38.950> test<00:03:39.250> off<00:03:39.459> we're

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
alright let's start this test off we're

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.180 
alright let's start this test off we're
going<00:03:39.790> to<00:03:39.850> fire<00:03:40.000> it<00:03:40.030> up<00:03:40.239> we<00:03:40.420> got<00:03:40.600> it<00:03:40.690> plugged<00:03:40.930> in

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
going to fire it up we got it plugged in

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.290 
going to fire it up we got it plugged in
and<00:03:42.190> see<00:03:42.430> if<00:03:42.489> I<00:03:42.580> can<00:03:42.700> use<00:03:42.790> this<00:03:42.910> upside<00:03:43.300> down

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
and see if I can use this upside down

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.250 
and see if I can use this upside down
okay<00:03:46.300> so<00:03:47.010> it<00:03:48.010> takes<00:03:48.220> a<00:03:48.310> while<00:03:48.459> to<00:03:48.519> boot<00:03:48.880> up

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
okay so it takes a while to boot up

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.900 
okay so it takes a while to boot up
alright<00:03:50.260> so<00:03:50.320> right<00:03:50.500> now<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:50.769> water<00:03:51.010> is<00:03:51.190> at<00:03:51.340> 68

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
alright so right now the water is at 68

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.650 
alright so right now the water is at 68
degrees<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:53.560> temperature<00:03:54.370> as<00:03:54.640> by<00:03:55.030> default<00:03:55.090> is

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
degrees the temperature as by default is

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.420 
degrees the temperature as by default is
set<00:03:55.690> for<00:03:56.130> 140<00:03:57.130> and<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:58.750> time<00:03:59.350> to<00:03:59.739> get<00:03:59.950> there<00:04:00.190> it

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
set for 140 and the time to get there it

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.420 
set for 140 and the time to get there it
looks<00:04:00.640> like<00:04:00.700> it's<00:04:00.910> going<00:04:01.030> to<00:04:01.060> be<00:04:01.180> 24<00:04:01.570> minutes

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
looks like it's going to be 24 minutes

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.860 
looks like it's going to be 24 minutes
that's<00:04:03.430> kind<00:04:03.640> of<00:04:03.670> what<00:04:03.790> I<00:04:03.820> wanted<00:04:04.060> to<00:04:04.180> do<00:04:04.300> let's

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
that's kind of what I wanted to do let's

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.680 
that's kind of what I wanted to do let's
do<00:04:05.080> a<00:04:05.110> I<00:04:06.070> was<00:04:06.430> thinking<00:04:06.730> of<00:04:06.820> doing<00:04:06.850> a<00:04:07.180> 50<00:04:07.390> degree

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
do a I was thinking of doing a 50 degree

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.729 
do a I was thinking of doing a 50 degree
differential<00:04:08.530> so<00:04:08.830> let<00:04:09.519> me<00:04:09.610> get<00:04:09.760> this<00:04:09.790> down<00:04:10.330> to

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
differential so let me get this down to

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.479 
differential so let me get this down to
130<00:04:12.810> roughly<00:04:13.810> we'll<00:04:14.440> go<00:04:14.530> 128<00:04:15.100> to<00:04:15.250> make<00:04:15.370> it

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
130 roughly we'll go 128 to make it

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.259 
130 roughly we'll go 128 to make it
exact

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.390 

all<00:04:21.269> right<00:04:21.569> and<00:04:21.959> I<00:04:22.620> think<00:04:22.830> that's<00:04:23.009> really<00:04:23.129> all

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
all right and I think that's really all

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.399 
all right and I think that's really all
there<00:04:23.520> is<00:04:23.550> to<00:04:23.639> it<00:04:23.940> you<00:04:24.539> can<00:04:24.659> also<00:04:24.840> change<00:04:25.259> your

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:25.409 
there is to it you can also change your

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:28.760 
there is to it you can also change your
time<00:04:25.710> it'll<00:04:26.039> give<00:04:26.190> you<00:04:26.280> an<00:04:26.400> alarm<00:04:26.750> but<00:04:27.770> let's

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
time it'll give you an alarm but let's

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.180 
time it'll give you an alarm but let's
just<00:04:28.889> see<00:04:29.009> what<00:04:29.129> happens

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
just see what happens

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.369 
just see what happens
push<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:32.340> play<00:04:32.520> button<00:04:32.550> to<00:04:33.000> set<00:04:33.210> it<00:04:33.330> in<00:04:33.539> motion

00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:34.379 
push the play button to set it in motion

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:37.879 
push the play button to set it in motion
looks<00:04:35.159> like<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.520> circulating<00:04:36.620> portion<00:04:37.620> of

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
looks like the circulating portion of

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.240 
looks like the circulating portion of
the<00:04:38.190> unit<00:04:38.789> works<00:04:38.970> really<00:04:39.180> well<00:04:39.979> you<00:04:40.979> can<00:04:41.129> see

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
the unit works really well you can see

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.379 
the unit works really well you can see
that<00:04:41.400> it's<00:04:41.520> moving<00:04:41.639> that<00:04:41.909> water<00:04:42.090> pretty

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
that it's moving that water pretty

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.020 
that it's moving that water pretty
decent<00:04:42.889> so<00:04:43.889> I'm<00:04:44.460> going<00:04:44.610> to<00:04:44.639> just<00:04:44.759> start<00:04:44.940> a

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
decent so I'm going to just start a

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.149 
decent so I'm going to just start a
timer<00:04:45.180> now<00:04:45.650> and<00:04:47.990> we'll<00:04:48.990> be<00:04:49.080> back<00:04:49.259> when<00:04:49.560> we<00:04:49.889> hit

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:50.159 
timer now and we'll be back when we hit

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:52.969 
timer now and we'll be back when we hit
our<00:04:50.220> differential<00:04:51.289> okay<00:04:52.289> guys<00:04:52.469> so<00:04:52.680> it<00:04:52.800> looks

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
our differential okay guys so it looks

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:54.430 
our differential okay guys so it looks
like<00:04:53.039> we're<00:04:53.250> just<00:04:53.280> about<00:04:53.610> to<00:04:53.789> get<00:04:53.969> the<00:04:54.090> time

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
like we're just about to get the time

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.930 
like we're just about to get the time
it's<00:04:55.440> been<00:04:55.590> about<00:04:55.620> 22<00:04:56.219> minutes<00:04:56.990> we're<00:04:57.990> at<00:04:58.940> 120

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
it's been about 22 minutes we're at 120

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.680 
it's been about 22 minutes we're at 120
right<00:05:00.300> or<00:05:00.659> pardon<00:05:01.020> me<00:05:01.110> 128<00:05:01.710> I<00:05:02.330> did<00:05:03.330> say<00:05:03.539> it<00:05:03.629> was

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
right or pardon me 128 I did say it was

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.230 
right or pardon me 128 I did say it was
50<00:05:04.050> degrees<00:05:04.349> differential<00:05:05.250> it's<00:05:05.430> actually<00:05:05.789> 60

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
50 degrees differential it's actually 60

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.330 
50 degrees differential it's actually 60
hey<00:05:07.020> it's<00:05:07.259> early<00:05:07.469> in<00:05:07.560> the<00:05:07.590> morning<00:05:07.650> still<00:05:08.099> here

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
hey it's early in the morning still here

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.760 
hey it's early in the morning still here
so<00:05:08.599> yeah<00:05:09.599> I'm<00:05:09.780> really<00:05:09.930> happy<00:05:10.050> with<00:05:10.440> this<00:05:10.620> you

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
so yeah I'm really happy with this you

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.740 
so yeah I'm really happy with this you
know<00:05:10.860> one<00:05:11.099> thing<00:05:11.310> that<00:05:11.550> I<00:05:11.580> didn't<00:05:12.479> notice

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
know one thing that I didn't notice

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.499 
know one thing that I didn't notice
right<00:05:13.560> away<00:05:13.919> when<00:05:14.639> I<00:05:14.669> flipped<00:05:15.000> this<00:05:15.120> on<00:05:15.330> was

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:15.509 
right away when I flipped this on was

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:18.140 
right away when I flipped this on was
how<00:05:15.629> much<00:05:15.750> quieter<00:05:16.349> it<00:05:16.500> is<00:05:16.620> compared<00:05:17.520> to<00:05:17.789> the

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
how much quieter it is compared to the

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.360 
how much quieter it is compared to the
other<00:05:18.960> one<00:05:19.259> that<00:05:19.289> I<00:05:19.469> have<00:05:19.620> made<00:05:19.949> by<00:05:20.099> Poly

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
other one that I have made by Poly

they're<00:05:22.289> both<00:05:22.469> great<00:05:22.710> circulators<00:05:23.370> they're

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
they're both great circulators they're

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.670 
they're both great circulators they're
both<00:05:24.180> good<00:05:24.419> for<00:05:24.599> about<00:05:24.810> five<00:05:25.020> or<00:05:25.199> six<00:05:25.380> gallons

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
both good for about five or six gallons

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.089 
both good for about five or six gallons
of<00:05:26.009> water<00:05:26.810> you<00:05:27.810> know<00:05:27.900> it<00:05:28.050> did<00:05:28.229> four<00:05:28.529> gallons<00:05:28.919> in

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:29.099 
of water you know it did four gallons in

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:33.110 
of water you know it did four gallons in
my<00:05:30.029> apartment<00:05:30.389> at<00:05:30.479> four<00:05:30.719> gallons<00:05:31.139> in<00:05:32.120> 22

normally<00:05:34.650> you'd<00:05:34.800> fill<00:05:35.130> it<00:05:35.250> up<00:05:35.310> with<00:05:35.490> warm

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
normally you'd fill it up with warm

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:38.029 
normally you'd fill it up with warm
water<00:05:35.940> we<00:05:36.240> don't<00:05:36.300> take<00:05:36.599> any<00:05:36.900> close<00:05:37.590> to<00:05:37.860> that

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
water we don't take any close to that

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.860 
water we don't take any close to that
amount<00:05:38.069> usually<00:05:38.789> you're<00:05:38.909> only<00:05:39.029> going<00:05:39.210> to<00:05:39.270> do

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
amount usually you're only going to do

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.959 
amount usually you're only going to do
about<00:05:40.050> 15<00:05:40.560> degree<00:05:40.860> differential<00:05:41.310> for<00:05:41.699> beef

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:41.969 
about 15 degree differential for beef

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:45.080 
about 15 degree differential for beef
and<00:05:42.270> things<00:05:42.509> like<00:05:42.690> that<00:05:42.949> so<00:05:43.949> yeah<00:05:44.520> this<00:05:44.759> looks

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
and things like that so yeah this looks

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.149 
and things like that so yeah this looks
like<00:05:45.150> a<00:05:45.270> cool<00:05:45.569> little<00:05:45.750> unit<00:05:46.199> I'll<00:05:46.620> be<00:05:46.770> using<00:05:47.069> it

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:47.159 
like a cool little unit I'll be using it

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:49.159 
like a cool little unit I'll be using it
