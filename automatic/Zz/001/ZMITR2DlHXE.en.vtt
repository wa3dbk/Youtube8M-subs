00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
now grill number 2 is something we have

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.370 
now grill number 2 is something we have
always<00:00:02.429> wanted<00:00:02.970> to<00:00:03.149> do<00:00:03.389> as<00:00:03.600> designers<00:00:03.810> and

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
always wanted to do as designers and

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.990 
always wanted to do as designers and
game<00:00:04.529> developers<00:00:05.100> there's<00:00:05.490> never<00:00:05.730> been<00:00:05.819> a

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
game developers there's never been a

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000 
game developers there's never been a
time<00:00:06.240> in<00:00:06.450> my<00:00:06.569> 25<00:00:07.049> years<00:00:07.319> of<00:00:07.379> building<00:00:07.770> games

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
time in my 25 years of building games

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.009 
time in my 25 years of building games
where<00:00:08.519> we<00:00:09.030> did<00:00:09.210> not<00:00:09.389> have<00:00:09.570> this<00:00:09.690> conversation

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
where we did not have this conversation

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.629 
where we did not have this conversation
at<00:00:10.380> least<00:00:10.559> once<00:00:10.920> when<00:00:11.070> we<00:00:11.099> were<00:00:11.250> starting<00:00:11.580> a

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
at least once when we were starting a

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.839 
at least once when we were starting a
game<00:00:12.410> we<00:00:13.410> wanted<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:13.860> be<00:00:13.980> able<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.340> blow<00:00:14.610> up

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
game we wanted to be able to blow up

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.769 
game we wanted to be able to blow up
anything<00:00:15.750> anytime<00:00:16.820> anywhere<00:00:20.270> so<00:00:21.270> we<00:00:21.449> built

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
anything anytime anywhere so we built

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.230 
anything anytime anywhere so we built
the<00:00:21.960> entire<00:00:22.410> world<00:00:22.920> out<00:00:23.279> of<00:00:23.369> little<00:00:24.029> teeny

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
the entire world out of little teeny

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.689 
the entire world out of little teeny
pieces<00:00:24.600> called<00:00:24.990> voxels<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.769> we<00:00:26.460> can

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
pieces called voxels and we can

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.700 
pieces called voxels and we can
literally<00:00:27.060> blow<00:00:27.420> up<00:00:27.660> anything<00:00:28.260> anytime

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
literally blow up anything anytime

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.870 
literally blow up anything anytime
anywhere

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
anywhere

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.299 
anywhere
so<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.570> second<00:00:30.960> Grail<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.439> destructibility

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
so the second Grail is destructibility

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.350 
so the second Grail is destructibility
and<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:33.000> changes<00:00:33.540> everything<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.469> game

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
and it changes everything in the game

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.940 
and it changes everything in the game
I'm<00:00:36.360> going<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.840> show<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.020> some<00:00:37.320> examples<00:00:37.800> of

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
I'm going to show you some examples of

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.680 
I'm going to show you some examples of
how<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.129> looks<00:00:38.309> but<00:00:38.730> first<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.450> want<00:00:39.629> to

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
how that looks but first I want to

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.299 
how that looks but first I want to
briefly<00:00:39.870> mention<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.680> because<00:00:41.040> everything

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
briefly mention that because everything

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.040 
briefly mention that because everything
is<00:00:41.550> made<00:00:41.700> out<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.910> voxels<00:00:42.420> we<00:00:42.719> can<00:00:42.899> not<00:00:43.020> only

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
is made out of voxels we can not only

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.130 
is made out of voxels we can not only
destroy<00:00:43.980> those<00:00:44.489> voxels<00:00:44.969> we<00:00:45.329> can<00:00:45.480> also<00:00:45.629> build

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
destroy those voxels we can also build

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.470 
destroy those voxels we can also build
them<00:00:46.379> up<00:00:46.500> on<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.770> fly<00:00:47.010> with<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.910> construct

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
them up on the fly with the construct

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.750 
them up on the fly with the construct
ability<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.739> allows<00:00:50.070> us<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.340> create<00:00:50.640> all

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
ability and that allows us to create all

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.369 
ability and that allows us to create all
kinds<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:51.120> special<00:00:51.539> abilities<00:00:52.020> for<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
kinds of special abilities for the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.920 
kinds of special abilities for the
different<00:00:52.739> for<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.340> different<00:00:53.430> classes<00:00:54.059> for

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
different for the different classes for

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.170 
different for the different classes for
instance<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.649> human<00:00:56.010> wizard<00:00:56.340> has<00:00:56.550> something

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
instance the human wizard has something

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.819 
instance the human wizard has something
called<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.480> crystal<00:00:57.899> wall<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.649> can<00:00:58.800> see

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
called a crystal wall and you can see

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.760 
called a crystal wall and you can see
that<00:00:59.460> she<00:00:59.670> can<00:00:59.789> run<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.329> rick<00:01:00.719> voxels<00:01:01.320> straight

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
that she can run a rick voxels straight

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.680 
that she can run a rick voxels straight
out<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.039> ground<00:01:02.160> now<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.030> kobolds<00:01:03.420> need

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
out of the ground now the kobolds need

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.329 
out of the ground now the kobolds need
to<00:01:03.809> break<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.229> down<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.769> when<00:01:05.129> they<00:01:05.280> do

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
to break that down and when they do

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.230 
to break that down and when they do
she'll<00:01:05.850> need<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.119> stop<00:01:06.420> them

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.650 

by<00:01:10.240> using<00:01:10.540> upheaval<00:01:11.290> and<00:01:12.480> upheaval<00:01:13.480> can

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
by using upheaval and upheaval can

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.720 
by using upheaval and upheaval can
destroy<00:01:14.020> bridges<00:01:14.530> you<00:01:14.710> can<00:01:14.860> block<00:01:15.100> staircases

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:15.730 
destroy bridges you can block staircases

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.790 
destroy bridges you can block staircases
all<00:01:16.060> kinds<00:01:16.420> of<00:01:16.480> different<00:01:16.780> things<00:01:16.810> now<00:01:17.590> she's

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
all kinds of different things now she's

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.170 
all kinds of different things now she's
not<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.100> only<00:01:18.340> one<00:01:18.490> that<00:01:18.610> can<00:01:18.760> do<00:01:18.850> this<00:01:18.880> kind

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
not the only one that can do this kind

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.020 
not the only one that can do this kind
of<00:01:19.330> thing<00:01:19.540> in<00:01:19.690> fact<00:01:19.900> the<00:01:20.230> warrior<00:01:20.590> has<00:01:20.940> one<00:01:21.940> of

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
of thing in fact the warrior has one of

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.580 
of thing in fact the warrior has one of
my<00:01:22.090> favorite<00:01:22.480> abilities<00:01:22.870> in<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.080> game<00:01:23.110> called

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
my favorite abilities in the game called

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.240 
my favorite abilities in the game called
whirlwind

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
whirlwind

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.980 
whirlwind
now<00:01:24.490> he's<00:01:24.640> gonna<00:01:24.850> leap<00:01:25.030> over<00:01:25.270> that<00:01:25.420> chasm<00:01:25.840> and

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
now he's gonna leap over that chasm and

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:41.270 
now he's gonna leap over that chasm and
do<00:01:26.110> some<00:01:26.290> damage

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.190 

so<00:01:42.280> that's<00:01:42.490> destructibility<00:01:43.149> and<00:01:43.540> it<00:01:43.659> changes

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
so that's destructibility and it changes

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.899 
so that's destructibility and it changes
an<00:01:44.350> amazing<00:01:44.979> amount<00:01:45.189> of<00:01:45.310> stuff<00:01:45.520> in<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.759> game

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
an amazing amount of stuff in the game

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.850 
an amazing amount of stuff in the game
because<00:01:46.270> not<00:01:46.479> only<00:01:46.720> is<00:01:46.840> it<00:01:46.869> fun<00:01:47.170> to<00:01:47.290> just<00:01:47.500> rip

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
because not only is it fun to just rip

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.859 
because not only is it fun to just rip
the<00:01:48.009> crap<00:01:48.280> out<00:01:48.490> of<00:01:48.520> a<00:01:48.700> battlefield<00:01:49.030> but<00:01:49.720> it's

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
the crap out of a battlefield but it's

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.020 
the crap out of a battlefield but it's
also<00:01:50.049> it's<00:01:50.619> also<00:01:50.770> amazing<00:01:51.490> what<00:01:51.610> we<00:01:51.729> can<00:01:51.759> do

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
also it's also amazing what we can do

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.090 
also it's also amazing what we can do
with<00:01:52.180> scenarios<00:01:52.689> at<00:01:52.840> that<00:01:52.990> point<00:01:53.229> too<00:01:53.439> you<00:01:53.920> can

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
with scenarios at that point too you can

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.100 
with scenarios at that point too you can
imagine<00:01:54.340> a<00:01:54.670> player<00:01:54.880> versus<00:01:55.299> player<00:01:55.329> scenario

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
imagine a player versus player scenario

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.230 
imagine a player versus player scenario
where<00:01:56.619> one<00:01:56.860> side<00:01:57.100> is<00:01:57.250> protecting<00:01:57.759> a<00:01:57.820> castle

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
where one side is protecting a castle

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.820 
where one side is protecting a castle
and<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.479> other<00:01:58.630> side<00:01:58.869> has<00:01:58.899> catapults<00:01:59.679> and

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
and the other side has catapults and

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.740 
and the other side has catapults and
they're<00:02:00.399> destroying<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:00.939> other<00:02:01.270> keep<00:02:01.539> and

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
if it gets somewhere bad it's going to

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.089 
if it gets somewhere bad it's going to
be<00:02:10.660> bad<00:02:10.869> for<00:02:10.899> everybody<00:02:11.319> around<00:02:11.620> so<00:02:12.010> the

it as it moves this kind of

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.340 
it as it moves this kind of
destructibility<00:02:16.209> allows<00:02:16.690> us<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.049> create<00:02:17.230> a

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
destructibility allows us to create a
