MATHEUS
THE HISTORY OF A WARRIOR | GRENDACC

00:00:45.705 --> 00:00:47.203
I want a hairstyle
just like yours!

00:00:48.821 --> 00:00:50.345
How are you,
Matheusinho?

00:00:50.454 --> 00:00:51.628
How have you been?

00:00:51.722 --> 00:00:52.779
It's been a long time!

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:55.998
You are so big!

00:00:56.407 --> 00:00:58.829
God cured him,

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.251
we are very happy
we managed to help him...

00:01:03.252 --> 00:01:04.991
in a certain way,

00:01:05.118 --> 00:01:08.619
and we are really happy
to see how strong he is,

00:01:08.846 --> 00:01:10.085
very healthy,

00:01:10.086 --> 00:01:12.028
and, as I told him, hairy!

00:01:26.292 --> 00:01:28.667
You came here for the first time
two years ago,

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.941
you were being treated,
you were bald,

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.731
tell us about your treatment,

00:01:33.732 --> 00:01:37.288
now you have a mohawk,
Edu Dracena said he liked it,

00:01:37.405 --> 00:01:38.548
tell us.

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:43.641
I learned a lot of things
during that time,

00:01:44.535 --> 00:01:47.147
and, in the future,
I'll be here playing soccer.

00:01:47.487 --> 00:01:49.558
Will you be a Santos FC
soccer player?

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:50.448
Yes!

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.050
Soccer is in our family's DNA,

00:02:09.051 --> 00:02:10.257
as well as Santos FC is,

00:02:10.258 --> 00:02:12.471
and it's been like that
for generations,

00:02:12.615 --> 00:02:15.927
Santos FC is, indeed,
part of our family.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.172
Santos FC helped Matheus
a lot during this treatment,

00:02:19.173 --> 00:02:20.593
I can only say thanks,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.013
it's been two years and half
since the last time we came here,

00:02:23.014 --> 00:02:25.408
his treatment was concluded
one month ago, he's fine,

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:30.747
and we wanted to come here
to say thanks for everything,

00:02:30.748 --> 00:02:33.775
and for the support he received
throughout his treatment.

00:02:33.776 --> 00:02:38.962
Of course the medications, God
and the professionals were important...

00:02:38.963 --> 00:02:40.275
for him to get healed,

00:02:40.276 --> 00:02:43.522
but to be able to come here,
in the beginning of the treatment,

00:02:43.523 --> 00:02:46.150
to meet his idols
at the place he loves,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.281
at the place he wants to be
in the future,

00:02:49.282 --> 00:02:51.999
was crucial for him to get healed.
