00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:19.919
 Bernard Hinault How did you come to cycling? 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:22.919
 Regine Laurence Gbagbo oppose but more and more emulators 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:24.599
 I continue to learn 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.199
 at the beginning at the same time 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:27.699
 and more and more dense 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.699
 there is a little bit of that four years already has a good track record 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.560
 not so much so big that I think that's normal 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.680
 but what are the titles you did 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.600
 ivory 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.420
 dressed in dark believe they are many like 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.930
 twice champion of France 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.510
 the one for stoves thinking of doses on France to continue this year 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.750
 in 114 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.750
 Gbagbo 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.370
 his first youth race 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.190
 and Bernard when I want to give advice that I give everyone 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.090
 that is to say, cautious advice and wisdom 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.110
 Bernard who has tempered fine 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.280
 of recommended packages a spa 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.480
 and well after he left the four competitors he beat in sprint for 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.940
 his first race and it was already a victory 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.550
 and after the secular home europe I won almost everything Sunday 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.240
 what have you always listened to 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.310
 well, it's a little sad to say that no, unfortunately, because 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.720
 given its strength 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.280
 he was making monumental tactical mistakes cpg not to gain mayer 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.020
 had trouble learning to run he was not aware that he had done 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.250
 a mistake 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.680
 even we see the name of his son on the newspapers 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.660
 to see him 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.660
 as a future great cycling champion who foamed the mayor's reaction 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.880
 to make purchases by the fed 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.620
 and it will not be the easy end of the race 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.570
 we did not exist automatically if you are thing 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.940
 I was waiting for you to have an idyll 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.279
 the arrival the polo to the afp if he had escaped the something 

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:11.399
 and when we hear automatic weapons march did things 

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:14.179
 as I wanted to cycle what I wanted to encourage 

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:17.179
 oh yes he had automatic 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.359
 but on the other I did not like that too but in the 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:23.359
 is not sure if if but if edouard collin handle 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.569
 a few flushes of agony to make them explode 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.299
 for the moment the theme 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.150
 and to augur this jersey on the way 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.129
 his new film nothing 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:33.669
 I see it 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:36.569
 because I did not let go of the harvest is happy with him 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.899
 epinal automatically and appalaches rebooted at the bottom of 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:41.989
 tracks and with the advent 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.989
 first state network to start it was already something 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:46.529
 after suna 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:48.729
 eto'o had the tricolor jersey 

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:50.109
 after this first 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.719
 know it no benefit 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:55.559
 and it's true but it sucks it's good 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:57.359
 we say the means for the europa league 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.359
 the idea that does things 

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:05.119
 2 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.659
 for you, who is the best runner 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:17.839
 for what reasons 

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:20.059
 it is complete on all levels 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:21.359
 then it's still practical 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.759
 it is the most qualities 

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:27.549
 it's the difference of rhythm that is able to do during a race 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:30.799
 and he rolled to 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.819
 at 45 he was according to the decrees of the routine 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:42.869
 mackinnon romaric which is made up of professionals that poses problem in 

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:45.869
 the couple 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.559
 but not only 

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:54.559
 related issues 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.109
 south sector wind 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.879
 that difficult 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.109
 in the beginning yes of course 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:08.109
 yet I have a fear and continue in this area 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.620
 the Haitian National Police but rather for the sports director 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.859
 of hamburg the national 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.800
 see what I want on the spot on a puncture when I should have 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.440
 to abandon 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.580
 according to him 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.580
 and it's not my temper to stop him 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.280
