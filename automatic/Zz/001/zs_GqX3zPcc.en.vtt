00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
put a lot of time into it where perhaps

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.649 
put a lot of time into it where perhaps
the<00:01:40.759> 2013<00:01:41.759> stuff<00:01:42.000> was<00:01:42.180> put<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.479> one<00:01:42.600> side

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.350 
but more realistic and stuff which if it
was<00:01:58.020> more<00:01:58.860> immersive<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.640> like<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.939> pit<00:02:00.090> stops

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
was more immersive I like the pit stops

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.830 
was more immersive I like the pit stops
lot

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840

yeah<00:02:02.439> I'm<00:02:02.890> pretty<00:02:03.039> impressed<00:02:03.310> for<00:02:03.549> the<00:02:03.609> game<00:02:03.789> I

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
yeah I'm pretty impressed for the game I

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.060 
yeah I'm pretty impressed for the game I
would<00:02:05.020> pretty<00:02:05.109> get<00:02:05.320> like<00:02:05.409> an<00:02:05.530> eight<00:02:05.679> or<00:02:05.829> nine

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
would pretty get like an eight or nine

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.009 
would pretty get like an eight or nine
out<00:02:06.280> of<00:02:06.310> ten<00:02:06.460> I've<00:02:06.609> only<00:02:07.390> paid<00:02:07.630> it<00:02:07.719> initially

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
out of ten I've only paid it initially

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.169 
out of ten I've only paid it initially
so<00:02:08.289> far<00:02:08.500> so<00:02:08.739> I<00:02:08.979> paid<00:02:09.459> something<00:02:09.789> most<00:02:09.970> of<00:02:10.119> the

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
so far so I paid something most of the

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.660 
so far so I paid something most of the
80s<00:02:10.509> cars<00:02:10.780> also<00:02:11.769> done<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.129> first<00:02:12.310> race<00:02:12.519> of

career mode and some scenarios um yeah

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.330 
career mode and some scenarios um yeah
07<00:02:16.780> /<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:17.080> game<00:02:17.230> I<00:02:17.319> always<00:02:17.530> liked<00:02:17.709> f1<00:02:18.099> games

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
07 / to the game I always liked f1 games

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.610 
07 / to the game I always liked f1 games
from<00:02:18.549> codemasters<00:02:19.209> and<00:02:19.510> it's<00:02:20.170> just<00:02:20.319> it's<00:02:20.470> a

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
from codemasters and it's just it's a

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.900 
from codemasters and it's just it's a
gradual<00:02:20.950> improvement<00:02:21.459> it's<00:02:21.610> not<00:02:21.760> much

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
gradual improvement it's not much

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.509 
gradual improvement it's not much
different<00:02:22.150> than<00:02:22.739> actual<00:02:23.739> driving<00:02:24.040> I<00:02:24.310> guess

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
different than actual driving I guess

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.720 
different than actual driving I guess
and<00:02:24.879> first<00:02:25.660> of<00:02:25.780> all<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:25.989> was<00:02:26.250> was<00:02:27.250> it<00:02:27.459> feels

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
and first of all it was was it feels

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.369 
and first of all it was was it feels
like<00:02:27.819> the<00:02:27.940> tie<00:02:28.150> ways<00:02:28.330> perhaps<00:02:28.750> slightly<00:02:29.110> more

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
like the tie ways perhaps slightly more

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.830 
like the tie ways perhaps slightly more
aggressive<00:02:29.739> if<00:02:29.890> you<00:02:30.010> go<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.700> very<00:02:31.480> high

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
aggressive if you go a very high

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.699 
aggressive if you go a very high
camber<00:02:32.970> but<00:02:33.970> generally<00:02:34.150> I<00:02:34.360> think<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:35.560> game

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
camber but generally I think the game

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.940 
camber but generally I think the game
was<00:02:35.860> pretty<00:02:36.010> nice<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:36.489> was<00:02:37.180> I<00:02:37.680> don't<00:02:38.680> know<00:02:38.799> how

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
was pretty nice it was I don't know how

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.199 
was pretty nice it was I don't know how
to<00:02:39.010> expected<00:02:39.400> that<00:02:39.519> the<00:02:39.610> diamond<00:02:39.910> does<00:02:40.030> feel

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
to expected that the diamond does feel

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.250 
to expected that the diamond does feel
very<00:02:40.239> similar<00:02:40.660> but<00:02:40.720> less<00:02:40.810> feel<00:02:40.989> a<00:02:41.019> little<00:02:41.110> bit

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
very similar but less feel a little bit

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.479 
very similar but less feel a little bit
different<00:02:41.530> as<00:02:41.590> well<00:02:41.709> it's<00:02:41.950> like<00:02:42.069> a<00:02:42.099> few<00:02:42.370> little

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
different as well it's like a few little

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:43.920 
different as well it's like a few little
not<00:02:42.760> cheesy<00:02:43.060> will<00:02:43.209> notice<00:02:43.510> a<00:02:43.569> little<00:02:43.720> bit<00:02:43.900> of

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
not cheesy will notice a little bit of

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.780 
not cheesy will notice a little bit of
it<00:02:44.709> was<00:02:44.829> like<00:02:44.920> sometimes<00:02:45.310> two<00:02:45.430> cars<00:02:45.640> little

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
it was like sometimes two cars little

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.270 
it was like sometimes two cars little
bit<00:02:45.910> more<00:02:46.030> downfalls<00:02:46.480> perhaps<00:02:46.870> that's<00:02:47.680> my

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
bit more downfalls perhaps that's my

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.009 
bit more downfalls perhaps that's my
sort<00:02:48.579> of<00:02:48.640> freedom<00:02:48.940> on<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.150> game<00:02:49.420> perhaps<00:02:49.930> I

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
sort of freedom on the game perhaps I

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.420 
sort of freedom on the game perhaps I
don't<00:02:50.170> know<00:02:50.230> it's<00:02:50.739> hard<00:02:50.860> to<00:02:50.980> say<00:02:51.310> at<00:02:51.340> this

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
don't know it's hard to say at this

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.190 
don't know it's hard to say at this
moment<00:02:51.549> at<00:02:51.970> this<00:02:52.000> moment<00:02:52.299> I'm<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.569> dumb<00:02:52.750> put<00:02:53.019> one

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
moment at this moment I'm a dumb put one

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.000 
moment at this moment I'm a dumb put one
papa<00:02:53.440> race<00:02:54.030> or<00:02:55.030> twenty<00:02:55.390> percent<00:02:55.660> so<00:02:56.010> I'll

leave<00:02:57.160> it<00:02:57.310> for<00:02:57.370> now<00:02:57.579> but<00:02:57.819> I<00:02:58.000> was<00:02:58.239> i<00:02:58.480> felt<00:02:58.750> quite

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
comfortably the car is challenging as

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.039 
comfortably the car is challenging as
well<00:03:00.519> the<00:03:00.730> AI<00:03:00.849> seemed<00:03:01.269> quite<00:03:01.480> aggressive<00:03:01.900> as

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
well the AI seemed quite aggressive as

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.839 
well the AI seemed quite aggressive as
well<00:03:02.230> it<00:03:02.709> seemed<00:03:02.890> to<00:03:02.980> really<00:03:03.010> want<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:03.340> dive<00:03:03.610> up
