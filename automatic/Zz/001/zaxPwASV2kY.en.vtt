00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.210
El Niño: Is 2014 the new 1997?

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.500
Presented by Science@NASA

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.890
Every ten days,

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.740 position:69%
the Jason-2 satellite maps the global ocean,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.510 position:64%
monitoring changes in sea surface height,

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.200 position:80%
a measure of heat in the upper layers of the water.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.830 position:66%
Because our planet is more than 70% ocean,

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.690 position:73%
this information is crucial to global forecasts

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.000
of weather and climate.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.340 position:91%
Lately, Jason-2 has seen something brewing in the Pacific-

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.670
and it looks a lot like 1997.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.100 position:95%
'A pattern of sea surface heights and temperatures has formed

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.150 position:70%
that reminds me of the way the Pacific looked

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.630 position:66%
in the spring of 1997,' says Bill Patzert,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.480 position:81%
a climatologist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.350 position:84%
'That turned out to be the precursor of a big El Niño.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.730 position:97%
'We can't yet say for sure that an El Niño will develop in 2014,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.990
or how big it might be,'

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.360
cautions Mike McPhaden

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.860 position:98%
of NOAA's Pacific Environmental Research Laboratories in Seattle,

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.740
'but the Jason-2 data

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.370 position:83%
support the El Niño Watch issued last month by NOAA.'

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.210 position:92%
What Jason-2 has been seeing is a series of 'Kelvin waves'-

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.370
massive ripples in sea level

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.210
that travel across the Pacific

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.810
from Australia to South America.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.250 position:59%
Forecasters are paying close attention

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.310 position:77%
because these waves could be a herald of El Niño.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.120
The two phenomena,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.900
Kelvin waves and El Niño,

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.820
are linked by wind.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.050 position:67%
Pacific trade winds blow from east to west,

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.440 position:80%
pushing sun-warmed surface waters toward Indonesia.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.040
As a result,

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.630
the sea level near Indonesia

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.680 position:77%
is normally 45 cm higher than it is near Ecuador.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.890 position:67%
Researchers call that area the 'warm pool'-

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.410 position:88%
it is the largest reservoir of warm water on our planet.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.120
Sometimes, however,

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.110 position:67%
trade winds falter for a few days or weeks,

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.130
and some of that excess sea level

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.320
ripples back toward the Americas.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.180 position:59%
'That's a Kelvin wave,' says McPhaden.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.240 position:75%
'It's not unusual to see a couple every winter.'

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.980 position:91%
El Niño happens when trade winds falter not just for days,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.700
but for many months.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.110 position:80%
Then Kelvin waves cross the Pacific like a caravan,

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.510
raising sea level

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.000 position:80%
and leaving warmer equatorial waters in their wake.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.960
'The El Nino of 1997/98

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.990 position:64%
was a textbook example,' recalls Patzert.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.560 position:86%
'At that time we were getting data from TOPEX/Poseidon,

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.180
a predecessor of Jason-2.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.900 position:61%
Sea surface maps showed a whitish bump,

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.010 position:95%
indicating a sea level some 10 centimeters higher than usual,

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.390 position:91%
moving along the equator from Australia to South America.'

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.470 position:86%
'The same pattern is repeating in 2014,' says McPhaden.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.360
'A series of Kelvin waves

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.400 position:97%
generated by localized west wind bursts in the western Pacific

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.210 position:73%
that began in mid-January 2014 are headed east.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.690
Excitement is building

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.810 position:73%
as a third weakening of the Pacific trade winds

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.760
happened in mid-April.'

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.390 position:77%
Ocean and atmospheric scientists at NOAA and NASA

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.090 position:77%
are carefully monitoring the Pacific trade winds.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.050 position:83%
The tipping point for declaring a significant El Niño

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.130
will be an even longer lasting,

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.760 position:61%
larger collapse in Pacific trade winds,

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.180 position:58%
possibly signaling a shift in weather

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.000
all around our planet.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.730 position:97%
'It will become much clearer over the next two to three months

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.580
whether these recent developments

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.020 position:59%
are the forerunner of a major El Niño-

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.780 position:59%
or any El Niño at all,' says McPhaden.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.850 position:92%
'Jason-2 is a marvelous Kelvin wave counter,' adds Patzert,

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.660
'and it will tell the tale.'

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.350
