00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
I did I took two years to develop this

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.560 
I did I took two years to develop this
proprietary<00:00:25.650> process<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.699> combining

print<00:00:30.300> technology<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:31.380> create<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.740> 3d<00:00:32.130> effect

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
print technology to create a 3d effect

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.780 
print technology to create a 3d effect
and<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:33.600> use<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.989> media<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.040> four<00:00:35.399> times

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
and I use a media that is four times

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.610 
and I use a media that is four times
thicker<00:00:36.090> than<00:00:36.239> any<00:00:36.540> other<00:00:36.780> thin<00:00:37.079> skin<00:00:37.380> on<00:00:37.530> the
