00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:24.849
 about 450 belong to the oak genus 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:27.310
 species of evergreen or leafy trees 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.820
 deciduous characterized by large 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:34.529
 longevity and considerable dimensions 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.529
 therefore suitable for very large gardens 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.930
 the leaves have a variable shape e 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.930
 for some species in particular those 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:55.000
 deciduous and if in autumn they can take 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.000
 very ornamental colors 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.840
 the fruits the acorns are wrapped 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.250
 partially from a dome that can 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.250
 be smooth or thorny 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.840
 oaks generally require a 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.050
 well-drained soil to be put to 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.120
 cultivation prefer sunny locations 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.880
 but they can grow though 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.230
 partially in the shade they plant themselves in 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.230
 autumn or spring 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.380
 have the trick of sowing i 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.960
 oak seeds within a maximum of 2 months 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.230
 from harvesting because they are short 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.230
 duration 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.900
 in the following autumn you can then 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.080
 transplant them to the ground and 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:35.060
 release them to grow for 23 years before 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.060
 to put them permanently in place 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.170
 at that point you can also proceed 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.240
 with the pruning that will consist 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.910
 essentially in cutting branches 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.910
 side to keep the trunk clean
