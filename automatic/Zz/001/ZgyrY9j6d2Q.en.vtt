00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 Americans have their cars 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.810
 traditions can be said separate 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.200
 culture is a classic example 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.860
 ford econoline did you believe it 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.990
 American 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.450
 I also thought so at first you are 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.160
 information that it was collected in Europe cars 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.100
 so rare that we could not find 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.359
 data about where it was made known 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.630
 only date of birth 1973 her appearance 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.160
 causes a pleasant feeling of nostalgia 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.380
 small round headlights with chrome 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.540
 large mesh lattices 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.149
 radiator narrow taillights and 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.309
 interesting pro punching machine body 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.500
 equal with rear wheel drive y 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.989
 this ford interesting fate 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.600
 at first he was a regular van yes to him 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.719
 had a chance to go through a rework in Norwegian 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.420
 the company that made it that 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.090
 Now you see, I find it difficult right 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.000
 define its purpose to call 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.590
 I probably want a camper 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.109
 saloon company on the back wall before 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.480
 was the door of me she brewed these 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.850
 mounts for the spare wheel and the canister is not 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.280
 original let's see solo 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.439
 there is a minimum of amenities needed for 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.110
 living a couple of benches folding table 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.020
 gas stove and washbasin everywhere finish 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.759
 tree to give herself a little but this 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.549
 for lovers of winter sports 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.490
 skiing rested drank some tea 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.770
 ride again, you can change clothes 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.439
 now on the driver's seat between 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.930
 Seats towering hood with interesting 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.150
 stand for glasses that can be 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.990
 I will raise the Americans inline 6 cylinder 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.829
 3.9 liters carburetor engine 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.060
 tidy reminds Volga 124 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.700
 European origin indirectly 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.189
 confirms metric digitization of scales 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.780
 soft torpedo everything is very simple well 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.520
 what else to expect from and 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.650
 initial utilitarian car 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.990
 a motor 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.850
 Here it is unusual for 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.509
 Americans three-box 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.509
 gears 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.270
 it is located under the steering wheel immediately 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.880
 I remember our 21 Volga 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.159
 by the way and the switching algorithm here is that 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.740
 the engine pulls great on any 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.440
 so he turns 3 in a mortar quite 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.780
 enough the steering wheel spins very easily on 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.170
 rare benevolent universal 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.020
 car with a calm can say that 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.630
 the second such car in our country so far 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.959
 It was not found of course strange I secretly 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.880
 its origin is obscured 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.959
 appointment is not clear edakii 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.959
