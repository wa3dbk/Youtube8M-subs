00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.130
 we're almost talking about the present gabe 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.650
 few variations few changes barça and 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.349
 Madrid 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.809
 and similar to how we know them just 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:17.060
 at this moment but this image yes that 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.020
 is for the memory 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.450
 the barça that 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.950
 He did what he asked for sportsmanship is 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.950
 say make corridor to real madrid 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.810
 at the end of these things at the moment it 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.550
 he gives them a lot of importance and then he does not 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.990
 they end up being more than anecdotes 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.540
 Real Madrid had made him hallway what 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.490
 we have started one of the summaries 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.590
 initials 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.910
 he had made Barcelona a good person 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.940
 in this case he made corridor to the real 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.570
 madrid who walked last season 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.960
 in the barcelona he got 14 points for 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.120
 behind madrid 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.260
 and it made him hallway in a game in the 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.410
 that Real Madrid will win with 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.410
 clarity 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.930
 the players who best understand that 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.910
 kind of moments because they know that you can 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.820
 give the other way by playing in two 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:10.060
 big clubs are not barça-real madrid 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:14.110
 I found the party raul this game 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.850
 It looked like a cherry on top 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.200
 cake an extra prize for the fans 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.490
 Real Madrid - that's how the 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.340
 team and the club that I can not raise 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.439
 the necessary resistance before the 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.380
 white set is a match especially 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.659
 of 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.500
 totally opposed the real madrid 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.680
 champion the barceló 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.080
 signing a very bad year 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.310
 and that was noticed in the final score in the 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.770
 way to play in addition 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.560
 but they see that we are used to seeing 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.000
 with the value stitched at the foot and painting and 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.079
 pulling again and again 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.079
 this time I was heading 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:57.460
 always in your answers in your 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:00.040
 expressions in their reactions seemed not to 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.210
 give importance to that which was 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.630
 living your best moment as 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.630
 coach 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.009
 and had fallen in champions but 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.810
 I was winning the league and I was also 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.400
 clearly gaining Barcelona in that 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.520
 moment if you lived your best moment 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.690
 definitely 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.690
 upon leaving the team 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.959
 everything was happy 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:27.760
 Real Madrid and for you it looked 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.760
 Besieged from the second part 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.760
 on the scoreboard 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.430
 bojan on the field 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.560
 bojan what 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.650
 but especially at the pep stage 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.650
 guardiola 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.880
 of death 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.430
 to that ball that ends in goal for very 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.549
 little bit 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.340
 barça that a part as they said to see 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:58.300
 had to overcome 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:02.200
 of encouragement touched and on the other hand a 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.000
 team that knew champion and exercise of 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.510
 such these parties always have the 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.610
 danger of the goals 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.990
 a team is never satisfied 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.000
 wants more 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.890
 although I have the league won although all 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.290
 I have it in favor I always want more and 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.720
 that's why in these games while we see 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.700
 the first goal of higuaín in the classics 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.010
 in these matches 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.290
 the rival that arrives at a bad moment has 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.079
 to be very careful because 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.959
 the eternal rival is not going to forgive this 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.490
 was one of the examples with match that 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.040
 finish in a landslide 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:38.110
 good to the image of valdés after 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:42.060
 fit the goal of gonzalo higuaín 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:44.819
 it's not only in the bernabéu 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.400
 is that of course the rivalry is so big 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:50.040
 that in the end in this case the option to 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.780
 madrid hopes to underline this date 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.420
 on the calendar and I was the day of 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.470
 but in the end it did not reach what the 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:01.400
 players want to enter the story 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:04.140
 hoping to remember the little hand in 50 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.420
 distracter your mind and the time 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.599
 valdano as it is considered the barça 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.140
 in the time of cruyff the truth that everything 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:15.069
 it was in less marker 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.069
 4 hours 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.010
 I did not think I had indicated 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.169
 because also 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.139
 to protest the captain of FC Barcelona 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:31.500
 by that hand after the shot of 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.500
 robinho 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.869
 amazing 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:42.339
 to cover his face to protect the 

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:42.339
 face surely is not a penalty 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.380
 Real Madrid that had the opportunity to 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.530
 continue to increase your advantage when the 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.530
 king 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.580
 when the left side relation valdés 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.580
 that there on the right 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.170
 index finger raised towards the sky 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:06.880
 and claim your condition of the first 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:09.700
 goal scorer 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.270
 great gunboat robben image similar to 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.380
 that of Stoichkov many years before 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.280
 enjoying standing on the bench of 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.260
 a very clear victory 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.270
 the club that did very little in this 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:25.280
 encounter that was at the mercy of 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.280
 Realmadrid practically from the beginning 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:32.270
 I knew he was coming too 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.830
 the end of his beautiful story with the fc 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.160
 barcelona- delicious honey 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.180
 precious and prolific of more 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.030
 the great game and 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.550
 great titles that the island has won 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.860
 with the club it is true that all 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.680
 cycles have painful endings and this 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.410
 it was one although in ree at least it 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:56.360
 put he put the goal of honor to the club 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.360
 but it was the end of a cycle and you knew 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.180
 yes absolutely everything 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.960
 in the match won by Real Madrid
