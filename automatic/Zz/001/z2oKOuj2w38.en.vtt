 correct thousand 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.599
 it's a news 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.449
 the previous day from the proportion of young design students this project 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:21.560
 have experience that she can decipher it we need attention 

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:23.900
 said the founder of the movement

 at the time of the release of the movie dawn math and chemistry 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.990
 but the person who lives in 3d from that moment in the works of 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.930
 prospecting and begins to happen 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.200
 in all the steps from now on the work of the board has already achieved

 almost will be air chaos and early launches line 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.500
 nor the change to dctf after we hit the initial external information 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.130
 and internal it is necessary to choose a team to surprise and the specifications 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.280
 County 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.970
 and textures according to the studies of each champion, according to the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.070
 conveniences another variation that we can make your carbon colors 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.700
 in your house over the weekend to vary the government for this procedure 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.810
 Let's put a cop on

 and then we will start with the influence of the 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.520
 I also do not know how he will behave 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.970
 and how do you evaluate the car the lectures of the day 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.790
 plus the 3d victim another article is decision suspension two projectors 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.620
 today fit and russell spontaneously during his assets at 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.810
 automakers internal evaluation is much more positive this year by 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.899
 example they have them 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:19.579
 various internal profiles brought to you the steering wheel is coming out of the screen people 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:23.839
 understand how a month away inside the car the card is needed more 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:28.859
 efficient I'll stick with the car each one has a cut a texture in reality 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:31.119
 virtual 7h and only after analysis 

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:32.079
 I chose 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:37.669
 3 in these three or five towers fell in the world the days weeks here as people 

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:41.659
 has the math tip we can concentrate a lot on the quality of the 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:42.589
 materials 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:47.179
