00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
maybe like my seventh month of my

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.570 
maybe like my seventh month of my
pregnancy<00:00:50.290> with<00:00:50.830> my<00:00:51.010> twins<00:00:51.220> I<00:00:51.339> mean<00:00:51.549> I

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
pregnancy with my twins I mean I

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.890 
pregnancy with my twins I mean I
probably<00:00:51.850> wore<00:00:52.180> them<00:00:52.330> all<00:00:52.390> of<00:00:52.510> it<00:00:52.570> to<00:00:52.690> the<00:00:52.780> end

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
probably wore them all of it to the end

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.090
