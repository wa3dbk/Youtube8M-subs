00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.780

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:19.420
 out of the crowd have the parallel system 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.750

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.700
 fast long so I cross a 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.250
 hind leg and the woman is doing now 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:35.009

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.190
 produce and the weight on it 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:49.050
 only then we can do that 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:53.020
 woman the leg in Iraq looks back forward 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:55.060
 close again 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.770
 Here I would give him a little break 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:05.590
 start fast fast 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:10.090
 long for the speed of what 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:13.390

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.299

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.360
 sakkara wants to come 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.400
 when I stand that way she does it 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.950

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.840
 I can not go in there now 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.530
 without me here fairrank so it 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.410
 is better 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.200
 my leg already shows this direction and 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.410
 then I can move in very comfortably forward 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.410
 the st 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.319

 her appearances the man comes and 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.269

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.360
 Say back here always nice angle 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:03.569

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.670

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.910

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.579
 Greater distance the man comes easier 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:21.120

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:55.840

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:57.760

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.020
 Poor's upper body is always in the front 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:04.630
