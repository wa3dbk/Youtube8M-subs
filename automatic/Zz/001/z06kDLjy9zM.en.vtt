00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
really good but yeah and about with

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.100 
really good but yeah and about with
recoil<00:00:52.050> when<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.649> go<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.730> know<00:00:54.110> automatic

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
recoil when you go you know automatic

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.170 
recoil when you go you know automatic
and<00:00:55.320> long-range<00:00:55.770> cuz<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.370> think<00:00:56.520> your<00:00:56.730> job<00:00:56.969> guns

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
and long-range cuz I think your job guns

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.180 
and long-range cuz I think your job guns
are<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.109> shouldn't<00:00:58.920> be<00:00:59.039> too

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
are like that so I shouldn't be too

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.060 
are like that so I shouldn't be too
surprised<00:01:00.260> and<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.350> don't<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.620> know<00:01:01.770> if<00:01:01.949> you

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
surprised and I don't you know if you

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.380 
surprised and I don't you know if you
guys<00:01:02.190> notice<00:01:02.609> when<00:01:02.789> using<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.090> rocket

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
guys notice when using the rocket

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.090 
guys notice when using the rocket
launcher<00:01:03.600> like<00:01:03.750> they<00:01:03.870> go<00:01:04.019> downwards<00:01:04.619> as<00:01:04.860> they

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
launcher like they go downwards as they

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.340 
launcher like they go downwards as they
travel<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:06.030> usually<00:01:06.750> aim<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.960> little<00:01:07.170> higher

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
travel so I usually aim a little higher

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.100 
travel so I usually aim a little higher
like<00:01:08.159> with<00:01:08.400> kind<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.090> with<00:01:09.299> sniper<00:01:09.630> rifles

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
like with kind of with sniper rifles

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.840 
like with kind of with sniper rifles
there's<00:01:10.590> bullet<00:01:10.860> drop<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.400> guess<00:01:11.640> there's

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
there's bullet drop I guess there's

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.200 
there's bullet drop I guess there's
rocket<00:01:12.720> drop<00:01:12.930> here<00:01:13.140> too<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.760> you<00:01:14.760> know<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:15.119> the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
rocket drop here too so you know in the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.399 
rocket drop here too so you know in the
final<00:01:15.509> game<00:01:15.630> I'm<00:01:15.780> sure<00:01:15.810> that's<00:01:16.080> how<00:01:16.229> it's

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
final game I'm sure that's how it's

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.490 
final game I'm sure that's how it's
gonna<00:01:16.530> work<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:17.570> think<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.720> get<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:19.200> camera

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
gonna work so I think I get this camera

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.109 
gonna work so I think I get this camera
you<00:01:19.799> see<00:01:19.830> look<00:01:20.100> at<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.250> recoil<00:01:20.400> when<00:01:20.729> all<00:01:20.970> the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
you see look at the recoil when all the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.960 
you see look at the recoil when all the
weights<00:01:21.540> up<00:01:21.860> just<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:22.979> quick<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.460> get<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> chaos

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
and that kinetic kills me I'm close to

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.890 
and that kinetic kills me I'm close to
dying<00:03:57.239> I<00:03:57.329> think<00:03:57.510> there's<00:03:57.629> a<00:03:57.689> health

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
dying I think there's a health

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.470 
dying I think there's a health
background<00:03:58.469> that's<00:03:58.709> why<00:03:58.909> keep<00:03:59.909> by<00:04:00.060> healing<00:04:00.269> up

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
background that's why keep by healing up

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
background that's why keep by healing up

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
there and that would you call it like a

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.089 
there and that would you call it like a
servo<00:05:24.690> area<00:05:25.020> of<00:05:25.260> a<00:05:25.470> park<00:05:25.680> or<00:05:25.800> something<00:05:25.949> I
