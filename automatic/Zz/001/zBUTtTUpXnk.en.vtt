a stitch in and out in and out and
gather<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.420> up<00:01:09.479> into<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.869> circle<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.500> then<00:01:11.040> make

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
gather it up into a circle and then make

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.969 
gather it up into a circle and then make
sure<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:12.000> take<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.299> stitch<00:01:12.689> here<00:01:13.020> with<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.590> knot

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
sure you take a stitch here with a knot

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.190 
sure you take a stitch here with a knot
so<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.790> gathers<00:01:15.180> do<00:01:15.360> not<00:01:15.540> come<00:01:15.810> apart

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
so that the gathers do not come apart

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.780 
so that the gathers do not come apart
and<00:01:16.500> then<00:01:16.799> we're<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.100> cut<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.580> round

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
and then we're going to cut a round

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.730 
and then we're going to cut a round
circle<00:01:18.180> about<00:01:18.600> one<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.960> half<00:01:19.110> inches<00:01:19.530> for

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
circle about one and a half inches for

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.649 
circle about one and a half inches for
this<00:01:19.890> size<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.340> lace<00:01:20.610> if<00:01:20.909> you're<00:01:21.450> using

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
this size of lace if you're using

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.719 
this size of lace if you're using
smaller<00:01:22.080> lace<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.619> smaller<00:01:23.070> circle<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.640> this

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
smaller lace a smaller circle and this

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.670 
smaller lace a smaller circle and this
is<00:01:23.939> stiff<00:01:24.270> felt<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:25.080> could<00:01:25.259> use<00:01:25.409> regular

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
is stiff felt you could use regular

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.679 
is stiff felt you could use regular
filled<00:01:26.159> as<00:01:26.280> well<00:01:26.460> but<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.729> like<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.150> stiff<00:01:27.450> felt

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
filled as well but I like the stiff felt

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.230 
filled as well but I like the stiff felt
because<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.990> gives<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.350> nice<00:01:28.619> solid<00:01:29.610> backing

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
because it gives a nice solid backing

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.240 
because it gives a nice solid backing
