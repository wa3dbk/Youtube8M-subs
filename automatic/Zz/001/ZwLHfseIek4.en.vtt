00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.769
 hey people, what is ten? 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.170
 welcome to another video too 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.849
 Grand Theft Auto 5 under in this video 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.279
 I'll show you how you do that 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.949
 Aircraft carrier super easy outdoors 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.020
 so that he can get online mode 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.359
 this without the hot missions too 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.880
 consider gambling with your friends 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.590
 You just have to have one for that 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.689
 capture mission that I you in the 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.920
 video limp and linked to yours 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.050
 add game 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.630
 This capture mission should actually 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.940
 work on every platform 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.879
 I am not so sure about xbox 360 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.100
 but on all other platforms 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.289
 she works to 100 percent this 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.170
 kepler mission then just starts her 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.210
 and invite a few colleagues who the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.530
 aircraft carrier also in free mode 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.309
 want to see 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.680
 After that, you will continue to a station 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.289
 the camp where you have your teams 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.439
 you can then select all of them 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.750
 w or circle plates and read the job 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.990
 all at the same time if you did that 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.570
 then you land in many online 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.700
 lobbies and you should already be on the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.710
 plane carrier on it 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.240
 if landed in different lobbies 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.460
 You are your sports now 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.340
 easy on last place goes into 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.159
 Start menu and joint to a buddy after 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.119
 just with you in the carrier mission 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.220
 was in it 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.229
 and then you can definitely with 15 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.420
 people or how many you always 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.250
 are to be on the aircraft carrier it 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.560
 could explore everything there you can 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.450
 also times you see the one in 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.250
 A hectic is called simply 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.079
 It's definitely over here 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.180
 all rooms are open 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.159
 Here you can discover everything you can 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.170
 during the hot mission also discover 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.689
 can and sometimes are 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.549
 also in chats or helicopters on the 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.969
 plane carrier on it you can then 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.579
 just use it to fly and the 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.200
 Terrier times from afar or from the 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.140
 something to look at in any case 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.810
 it can also be really cool 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.870
 be that when you come into this lobby 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.640
 not me 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.190
 on the aircraft carrier outside somewhere 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.260
 If so, be curious in the city 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.210
 soon the fall is you just fly 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.490
 short plane carrier should be 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.320
 you are still in the sea where you are 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.210
 this is to be taken you see now 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.670
 already in the background on the map 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.460
 which is located at the bottom right 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.260
 the map should not actually there 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.110
 to be overlooked, you also see there 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.300
 on the map also a point for yours 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.520
 kepler mission in it you can 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.750
 orient it relatively well that was it then 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.180
