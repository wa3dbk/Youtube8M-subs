00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:20.639 
just know that if you're gonna put a

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:23.660 
just know that if you're gonna put a
lens<00:01:20.909> on<00:01:21.149> this<00:01:21.299> camera<00:01:21.799> it<00:01:22.799> needs<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.310> be<00:01:23.459> a

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
lens on this camera it needs to be a

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.429 
lens on this camera it needs to be a
three<00:01:23.999> cam<00:01:24.270> lens<00:01:24.659> there<00:01:25.020> are<00:01:25.139> quite<00:01:25.349> a<00:01:25.380> few

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
three cam lens there are quite a few

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.339 
three cam lens there are quite a few
lenses<00:01:25.770> available<00:01:26.209> they've<00:01:27.209> got<00:01:27.539> a<00:01:27.569> few<00:01:28.020> zooms

00:01:28.339 --> 00:01:28.349 
lenses available they've got a few zooms

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:30.709 
lenses available they've got a few zooms
they've<00:01:29.039> got<00:01:29.279> some<00:01:29.549> very<00:01:29.579> wide<00:01:29.969> angle<00:01:30.389> lenses

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:30.719 
they've got some very wide angle lenses

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:32.389 
they've got some very wide angle lenses
they<00:01:30.899> got<00:01:31.049> some<00:01:31.200> very<00:01:31.409> telephoto<00:01:31.919> lenses

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
they got some very telephoto lenses

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.359 
they got some very telephoto lenses
they're<00:01:33.329> all<00:01:33.539> pretty<00:01:33.810> darn<00:01:34.109> expensive<00:01:34.369> the

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
they're all pretty darn expensive the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.339 
they're all pretty darn expensive the
ones<00:01:35.399> that<00:01:35.729> are<00:01:35.849> least<00:01:36.029> expensive<00:01:36.630> tend<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.169> be

00:01:37.339 --> 00:01:37.349 
ones that are least expensive tend to be

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:40.249 
ones that are least expensive tend to be
the<00:01:37.590> mid-range<00:01:37.979> zooms<00:01:38.459> there's<00:01:39.029> a<00:01:39.119> 35<00:01:39.569> to<00:01:39.810> 70

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
the mid-range zooms there's a 35 to 70

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.779 
the mid-range zooms there's a 35 to 70
that's<00:01:40.529> fairly<00:01:40.770> reasonable<00:01:41.429> in<00:01:41.549> cost<00:01:42.169> and

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
that's fairly reasonable in cost and

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.379 
that's fairly reasonable in cost and
it's<00:01:44.869> aperture<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:45.929> a<00:01:46.020> fixed<00:01:46.409> F<00:01:46.979> 3.5<00:01:47.789> I<00:01:47.819> believe

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:48.389 
it's aperture is a fixed F 3.5 I believe

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:50.149 
it's aperture is a fixed F 3.5 I believe
so<00:01:48.599> it's<00:01:48.719> not<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.020> fastest<00:01:49.439> lens<00:01:49.709> but<00:01:49.950> that's

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
so it's not the fastest lens but that's

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.379 
so it's not the fastest lens but that's
what<00:01:50.340> makes<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.669> a<00:01:50.789> little<00:01:50.969> less<00:01:51.149> expensive

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:51.389 
what makes it a little less expensive

lens<00:01:59.279> because<00:01:59.609> it's<00:01:59.789> standard<00:02:00.179> they<00:02:00.329> made<00:02:00.509> a

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
lens because it's standard they made a

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.870 
lens because it's standard they made a
ton<00:02:00.779> of<00:02:00.840> them<00:02:01.169> the<00:02:01.319> formula<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.159> very<00:02:02.309> simple

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
ton of them the formula is very simple

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.749 
ton of them the formula is very simple
and<00:02:03.539> you<00:02:04.169> know<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.499> 35<00:02:04.859> millimeter<00:02:05.069> Cron's<00:02:05.579> a

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
and you know the 35 millimeter Cron's a

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.209 
and you know the 35 millimeter Cron's a
little<00:02:05.969> more<00:02:06.799> as<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:08.039> go<00:02:08.220> wider<00:02:08.899> it<00:02:09.899> gets<00:02:10.259> more

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:11.219 
little more as you go wider it gets more

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:15.020 
little more as you go wider it gets more
expensive<00:02:11.519> because<00:02:12.739> SLR<00:02:13.739> wide-angle<00:02:14.610> lenses

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
expensive because SLR wide-angle lenses

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.000 
expensive because SLR wide-angle lenses
are

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
are

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.820

wide-angle<00:02:18.830> lenses<00:02:19.370> so<00:02:20.120> those<00:02:20.510> you'll<00:02:20.750> find

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
wide-angle lenses so those you'll find

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.780 
wide-angle lenses so those you'll find
get<00:02:21.290> pretty<00:02:21.500> expensive<00:02:21.860> as<00:02:22.250> you<00:02:22.400> get<00:02:22.579> down

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
get pretty expensive as you get down

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.750 
get pretty expensive as you get down
towards<00:02:23.319> the<00:02:24.319> 21<00:02:24.739> millimeter<00:02:25.010> I<00:02:25.340> think<00:02:25.670> they

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
towards the 21 millimeter I think they

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.360 
towards the 21 millimeter I think they
make<00:02:25.939> a<00:02:25.970> 19<00:02:26.450> or<00:02:26.720> an<00:02:26.810> 18<00:02:27.140> as<00:02:27.349> you<00:02:27.439> go<00:02:27.560> longer<00:02:27.950> it's

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
make a 19 or an 18 as you go longer it's

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.250 
make a 19 or an 18 as you go longer it's
kind<00:02:28.579> of<00:02:28.640> interesting<00:02:28.939> through<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.689> sort<00:02:30.200> of

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
kind of interesting through the sort of

kind of interesting through the sort of
middle<00:02:30.470> telephoto<00:02:31.220> it's<00:02:31.970> pretty<00:02:32.180> reasonable

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
middle telephoto it's pretty reasonable

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.319 
middle telephoto it's pretty reasonable
the<00:02:32.930> 90<00:02:33.200> I've<00:02:33.409> got<00:02:33.650> a<00:02:33.680> 90<00:02:34.069> here<00:02:34.310> this<00:02:34.519> is<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.670> 90<00:02:35.180> l

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:35.329

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
Marit it snapped 2.8 this is fairly

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.300 
Marit it snapped 2.8 this is fairly
reasonable<00:02:39.260> price<00:02:39.739> lens

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
reasonable price lens

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.009 
reasonable price lens
there's<00:02:40.970> also<00:02:41.390> a<00:02:42.549> zoom<00:02:43.549> ekron<00:02:43.849> 90<00:02:44.390> that's<00:02:44.720> more

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
there's also a zoom ekron 90 that's more

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.800 
there's also a zoom ekron 90 that's more
of<00:02:45.170> course<00:02:45.409> because<00:02:45.620> it's<00:02:45.799> a<00:02:45.890> faster<00:02:46.310> lens<00:02:46.810> 135

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
of course because it's a faster lens 135

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.149 
of course because it's a faster lens 135
is<00:02:47.930> pretty<00:02:48.140> reasonable<00:02:48.650> and<00:02:48.680> then<00:02:48.859> once<00:02:49.069> you

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159 
is pretty reasonable and then once you

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:50.589 
is pretty reasonable and then once you
get<00:02:49.310> beyond<00:02:49.549> that<00:02:49.579> it<00:02:49.970> starts<00:02:50.239> getting<00:02:50.540> a

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
get beyond that it starts getting a

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.440 
get beyond that it starts getting a
little<00:02:50.720> crazy<00:02:50.959> again<00:02:51.519> the<00:02:52.519> longer<00:02:52.849> lenses<00:02:53.239> can

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
little crazy again the longer lenses can

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.910 
little crazy again the longer lenses can
be<00:02:53.569> pretty<00:02:53.810> expensive<00:02:54.200> especially<00:02:54.500> the

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
be pretty expensive especially the

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.129 
be pretty expensive especially the

you'll<00:03:04.549> be<00:03:04.670> okay<00:03:05.000> and<00:03:05.180> that's<00:03:05.359> exactly<00:03:05.840> what

you'll be okay and that's exactly what
I've<00:03:06.349> done<00:03:06.590> I've<00:03:06.829> got<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.129> 50<00:03:07.400> Cimarron

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
I've done I've got the 50 Cimarron

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.460 
I've done I've got the 50 Cimarron
mounted<00:03:08.299> here

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
mounted here

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.430 
mounted here
as<00:03:10.129> I<00:03:10.370> just<00:03:10.579> showed<00:03:10.670> you<00:03:10.909> there's<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.599> 90<00:03:12.079> L<00:03:12.230> ma

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
as I just showed you there's the 90 L ma

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.960 
as I just showed you there's the 90 L ma
right<00:03:12.500> now<00:03:13.310> this<00:03:13.459> is<00:03:13.639> an<00:03:13.700> F<00:03:13.819> 2.8<00:03:14.359> lens<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:16.730> then

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
right now this is an F 2.8 lens and then

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.509 
right now this is an F 2.8 lens and then
I've<00:03:17.060> got<00:03:17.239> a<00:03:17.269> 28<00:03:17.870> millimeter<00:03:18.109> L<00:03:18.799> Marit<00:03:19.190> this<00:03:19.400> is

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
I've got a 28 millimeter L Marit this is

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.610 
I've got a 28 millimeter L Marit this is
also<00:03:19.909> a<00:03:20.150> 2.8<00:03:21.109> lens<00:03:21.379> these<00:03:22.370> guys<00:03:22.639> are<00:03:22.849> all

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
also a 2.8 lens these guys are all

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.339 
also a 2.8 lens these guys are all
fairly<00:03:24.620> reasonable<00:03:25.250> I<00:03:25.400> say<00:03:25.790> fairly<00:03:26.329> that's<00:03:27.169> in

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
fairly reasonable I say fairly that's in

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.180 
fairly reasonable I say fairly that's in
the<00:03:27.470> like<00:03:27.650> at<00:03:27.829> land<00:03:28.040> no<00:03:28.879> they're<00:03:29.599> not<00:03:29.750> cheap

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
the like at land no they're not cheap

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.099 
the like at land no they're not cheap
unfortunately<00:03:31.190> that's<00:03:32.000> why<00:03:32.209> I'm<00:03:32.389> trying<00:03:32.959> to

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
unfortunately that's why I'm trying to

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.610 
unfortunately that's why I'm trying to
figure<00:03:33.260> out<00:03:33.440> what<00:03:33.680> gear<00:03:34.160> I'm<00:03:34.310> gonna<00:03:34.489> sell<00:03:34.760> them

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
figure out what gear I'm gonna sell them

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.289 
figure out what gear I'm gonna sell them
as<00:03:36.620> I<00:03:36.799> said<00:03:37.010> before<00:03:37.160> it's<00:03:37.609> a<00:03:37.730> manual<00:03:38.030> wind

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
as I said before it's a manual wind

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.809 
as I said before it's a manual wind
camera<00:03:38.870> it's<00:03:39.470> got<00:03:39.650> a<00:03:39.680> super<00:03:39.980> smooth<00:03:40.489> wind

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
camera it's got a super smooth wind

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.970 
camera it's got a super smooth wind
feels<00:03:41.780> like<00:03:41.959> a<00:03:41.989> Swiss<00:03:42.290> watch<00:03:42.319> and<00:03:42.859> you're

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
feels like a Swiss watch and you're

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.890 
feels like a Swiss watch and you're
winding<00:03:43.190> this<00:03:43.489> thing<00:03:43.790> I<00:03:44.090> can<00:03:44.540> do<00:03:44.660> it<00:03:44.780> without

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
winding this thing I can do it without

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.319 
winding this thing I can do it without
busting<00:03:45.500> it<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:46.370> shutter<00:03:46.699> release<00:03:46.790> is<00:03:47.299> a

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
busting it the shutter release is a

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.569 
busting it the shutter release is a
little<00:03:47.780> different<00:03:48.319> there's<00:03:48.980> a<00:03:49.069> little<00:03:49.280> bit<00:03:49.459> of

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
little different there's a little bit of

little different there's a little bit of
a<00:03:49.669> delay<00:03:50.030> in<00:03:50.269> there<00:03:52.660> sounds<00:03:53.660> a<00:03:53.720> lot<00:03:53.870> different

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
a delay in there sounds a lot different

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.860 
a delay in there sounds a lot different
than<00:03:54.620> say<00:03:55.190> one<00:03:55.220> of<00:03:55.459> my<00:03:55.489> contacts<00:03:56.090> it's<00:03:56.599> not

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
than say one of my contacts it's not

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.379 
than say one of my contacts it's not
quite<00:03:57.139> as<00:03:57.290> sexy<00:03:57.560> it's<00:03:57.919> more<00:03:58.129> of<00:03:58.190> a<00:03:58.280> clunk<00:04:01.389> but

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
quite as sexy it's more of a clunk but

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:05.619 
quite as sexy it's more of a clunk but
you<00:04:02.659> can<00:04:02.840> barely<00:04:03.290> feel<00:04:03.530> it<00:04:04.120> happening<00:04:05.120> in<00:04:05.480> the

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
you can barely feel it happening in the

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:07.780 
you can barely feel it happening in the
camera<00:04:06.019> so<00:04:06.530> I<00:04:06.560> think<00:04:06.739> it's<00:04:07.129> pretty<00:04:07.579> well

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
camera so I think it's pretty well

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.430 
camera so I think it's pretty well
damped<00:04:10.000> it's<00:04:11.000> a<00:04:11.060> pretty<00:04:11.299> satisfying<00:04:11.900> sound<00:04:12.199> I

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
damped it's a pretty satisfying sound I

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.649 
damped it's a pretty satisfying sound I
guess<00:04:12.500> I<00:04:12.799> would<00:04:12.949> say<00:04:13.129> in<00:04:13.310> general<00:04:13.659> can't

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:14.659 
guess I would say in general can't

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:18.159 
guess I would say in general can't
complain<00:04:14.959> about<00:04:15.019> it<00:04:15.379> much<00:04:16.900> there's<00:04:17.900> one<00:04:18.019> thing

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
complain about it much there's one thing

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:19.839 
complain about it much there's one thing
that<00:04:18.229> really<00:04:18.620> improves<00:04:19.010> the<00:04:19.220> handling<00:04:19.400> of

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:19.849 
that really improves the handling of

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:23.850 
that really improves the handling of
this<00:04:20.030> camera<00:04:21.070> it<00:04:22.070> adds<00:04:22.220> a<00:04:22.310> lot<00:04:22.430> of<00:04:22.490> weight<00:04:22.760> but

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
this camera it adds a lot of weight but

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.589 
this camera it adds a lot of weight but
it<00:04:24.860> has<00:04:24.979> an<00:04:25.159> unbelievable<00:04:25.729> difference<00:04:25.969> in<00:04:26.510> the

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:26.599 
it has an unbelievable difference in the

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.559 
it has an unbelievable difference in the
way<00:04:26.719> the<00:04:26.840> camera<00:04:27.320> feels<00:04:27.590> in<00:04:27.770> the<00:04:27.889> hand

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:28.569 
way the camera feels in the hand

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:32.159 
way the camera feels in the hand
and<00:04:28.659> that<00:04:28.990> is<00:04:29.259> the<00:04:29.770> motor<00:04:30.699> drive<00:04:30.999> there's<00:04:31.869> also

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
and that is the motor drive there's also

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.169 
and that is the motor drive there's also
a<00:04:32.349> winder<00:04:32.860> but<00:04:33.219> the<00:04:33.339> motor<00:04:33.550> drive<00:04:33.849> is<00:04:34.029> the

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:34.179 
a winder but the motor drive is the

00:04:34.179 --> 00:04:36.149 
a winder but the motor drive is the
thing<00:04:34.360> that<00:04:34.389> really<00:04:34.839> adds<00:04:35.139> the<00:04:35.469> handling<00:04:36.009> and

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:36.159 
thing that really adds the handling and

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:39.839 
thing that really adds the handling and
we<00:04:36.249> show<00:04:36.429> you<00:04:36.490> why<00:04:36.929> so<00:04:37.929> to<00:04:37.990> mount<00:04:38.409> it<00:04:38.849> you

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849 
we show you why so to mount it you

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:41.760 
we show you why so to mount it you
basically<00:04:39.999> take<00:04:40.569> off<00:04:40.809> the<00:04:41.050> hand<00:04:41.319> grip<00:04:41.589> that

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
basically take off the hand grip that

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.100 
basically take off the hand grip that
has<00:04:41.949> the<00:04:42.099> batteries<00:04:42.520> in<00:04:42.699> it<00:04:43.050> there's<00:04:44.050> four

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
has the batteries in it there's four

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.100 
has the batteries in it there's four
batteries<00:04:44.669> motor<00:04:45.669> drive<00:04:45.969> just<00:04:46.270> slips<00:04:46.539> in<00:04:46.749> in

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
batteries motor drive just slips in in

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.739 
batteries motor drive just slips in in
its<00:04:47.319> place<00:04:47.709> it's<00:04:48.279> just<00:04:48.339> kind<00:04:48.639> of<00:04:48.729> cool

00:04:51.739 --> 00:04:51.749 

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:56.029 

then<00:04:52.749> it<00:04:52.899> screws<00:04:53.199> into<00:04:53.439> the<00:04:53.679> tripod<00:04:54.249> mount

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
then it screws into the tripod mount

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:58.350 
then it screws into the tripod mount
this<00:04:57.039> motor<00:04:57.279> drive<00:04:57.550> is<00:04:57.789> beautifully

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
this motor drive is beautifully

this motor drive is beautifully
engineered<00:04:58.509> just<00:04:59.139> like<00:04:59.289> the<00:04:59.409> camera<00:04:59.860> it<00:05:00.789> it's

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
engineered just like the camera it it's

a just a beautiful thing the best thing

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:07.199 
a just a beautiful thing the best thing
about<00:05:04.149> it<00:05:04.539> is<00:05:04.659> this<00:05:04.899> hand<00:05:05.169> strap<00:05:05.939> the<00:05:06.939> hand

this<00:05:10.209> camera<00:05:10.719> into<00:05:10.990> a<00:05:11.289> very<00:05:11.649> easy<00:05:12.039> to<00:05:12.399> manage

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:12.689 
this camera into a very easy to manage

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:15.449 
this camera into a very easy to manage
piece<00:05:13.689> of<00:05:13.839> equipment<00:05:14.319> that's<00:05:14.830> still<00:05:15.189> heavy

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:15.459 
piece of equipment that's still heavy

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:18.899 
piece of equipment that's still heavy
well<00:05:16.029> it's<00:05:16.149> even<00:05:16.270> heavier<00:05:17.399> but<00:05:18.399> it<00:05:18.729> just

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:18.909 
well it's even heavier but it just

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:20.670 
well it's even heavier but it just
transforms<00:05:19.599> the<00:05:19.749> handling<00:05:20.110> of<00:05:20.229> the<00:05:20.289> camera<00:05:20.649> I

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
transforms the handling of the camera I

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.839 
transforms the handling of the camera I
walked<00:05:21.009> around<00:05:21.129> with<00:05:21.249> this<00:05:21.399> thing<00:05:21.610> for<00:05:21.819> a

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:21.849 
walked around with this thing for a

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.570 
walked around with this thing for a
couple<00:05:22.149> of<00:05:22.209> hours<00:05:22.360> the<00:05:22.749> other<00:05:22.839> day<00:05:23.169> and<00:05:23.580> was

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
couple of hours the other day and was

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.969 
couple of hours the other day and was
perfectly<00:05:25.119> comfortable<00:05:25.979> admittedly

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
perfectly comfortable admittedly

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:29.159 
perfectly comfortable admittedly
occasionally<00:05:27.639> I'd<00:05:27.819> kind<00:05:28.059> of<00:05:28.149> do<00:05:28.269> like<00:05:28.389> this<00:05:28.689> or

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
occasionally I'd kind of do like this or

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.619 
occasionally I'd kind of do like this or
you<00:05:29.830> know<00:05:29.919> hold<00:05:30.189> it<00:05:30.279> like<00:05:30.429> this<00:05:30.610> a<00:05:31.059> lot<00:05:31.419> of<00:05:31.479> the

00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:31.629 
you know hold it like this a lot of the

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:33.540 
you know hold it like this a lot of the
time<00:05:31.809> I<00:05:31.839> just<00:05:32.080> had<00:05:32.349> it<00:05:32.469> like<00:05:32.619> this<00:05:32.769> hanging<00:05:33.129> you

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
time I just had it like this hanging you

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.429 
time I just had it like this hanging you
know<00:05:33.669> to<00:05:33.999> my<00:05:34.149> side<00:05:34.389> so<00:05:34.689> it's<00:05:34.930> a<00:05:35.019> big<00:05:35.199> deal<00:05:35.379> I

00:05:35.429 --> 00:05:35.439 
know to my side so it's a big deal I

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:37.320 
know to my side so it's a big deal I
think<00:05:35.860> I<00:05:36.159> would<00:05:36.279> consider<00:05:36.669> it<00:05:36.849> a<00:05:36.939> piece<00:05:37.119> of

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
think I would consider it a piece of

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.049 
think I would consider it a piece of
required<00:05:38.229> equipment<00:05:38.499> on<00:05:38.919> this<00:05:39.129> camera<00:05:39.399> so<00:05:39.759> as

00:05:40.049 --> 00:05:40.059 
required equipment on this camera so as

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:42.149 
required equipment on this camera so as
to<00:05:40.240> the<00:05:40.330> features<00:05:40.719> of<00:05:40.959> the<00:05:41.080> drive<00:05:41.289> itself<00:05:41.740> it's

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:42.159 
to the features of the drive itself it's

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:44.639 
to the features of the drive itself it's
got<00:05:42.369> you<00:05:43.149> know<00:05:43.209> a<00:05:43.269> single<00:05:43.689> frame<00:05:43.930> mode<00:05:44.259> let<00:05:44.559> me

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:44.649 
got you know a single frame mode let me

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:45.959 
got you know a single frame mode let me
go<00:05:44.740> ahead<00:05:44.800> and<00:05:45.009> turn<00:05:45.099> the<00:05:45.249> camera<00:05:45.399> on<00:05:45.610> here

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:45.969 
go ahead and turn the camera on here

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:50.719 
go ahead and turn the camera on here
manual<00:05:46.899> mode<00:05:46.930> it's<00:05:47.619> got<00:05:47.769> a<00:05:47.800> single<00:05:48.159> frame<00:05:48.399> mode

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:57.179 

it<00:05:51.729> has<00:05:51.759> a<00:05:53.009> continuous<00:05:54.009> low<00:05:56.009> continuous<00:05:57.009> high

00:05:57.179 --> 00:05:57.189 
it has a continuous low continuous high

00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:02.069 
it has a continuous low continuous high
mode<00:05:58.949> continuous<00:05:59.949> high<00:06:00.159> is<00:06:00.219> about<00:06:00.519> I<00:06:01.419> think

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:02.079 
mode continuous high is about I think

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:04.559 
mode continuous high is about I think
four<00:06:02.319> and<00:06:02.409> a<00:06:02.439> half<00:06:02.469> frames<00:06:02.860> per<00:06:03.069> second<00:06:03.569> now

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:04.569 
four and a half frames per second now

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:06.179 
four and a half frames per second now
one<00:06:04.809> thing<00:06:04.959> I've<00:06:05.110> noticed<00:06:05.289> is<00:06:05.529> the<00:06:05.709> drive<00:06:06.009> is

00:06:06.179 --> 00:06:06.189 
one thing I've noticed is the drive is

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:10.619 
one thing I've noticed is the drive is
not<00:06:06.219> particularly<00:06:06.939> loud<00:06:08.969> it's<00:06:09.969> not<00:06:10.209> that<00:06:10.419> much

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:10.629 
not particularly loud it's not that much

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:12.689 
not particularly loud it's not that much
louder<00:06:10.869> with<00:06:11.169> the<00:06:11.319> drive<00:06:11.559> than<00:06:12.069> without<00:06:12.519> the

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:12.699 
louder with the drive than without the

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:14.850 
louder with the drive than without the
drive<00:06:12.939> which<00:06:13.719> is<00:06:13.839> kind<00:06:14.050> of<00:06:14.139> interesting<00:06:14.409> I

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
drive which is kind of interesting I

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.949 
drive which is kind of interesting I
think<00:06:15.069> it's<00:06:15.189> because<00:06:15.459> it<00:06:15.639> slides<00:06:16.509> the<00:06:16.749> film

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:16.959 
think it's because it slides the film

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:18.509 
think it's because it slides the film
along<00:06:17.139> so<00:06:17.379> fast<00:06:17.649> you<00:06:17.829> don't<00:06:17.919> really<00:06:18.189> hear<00:06:18.399> it

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:18.519 
along so fast you don't really hear it

00:06:18.519 --> 00:06:20.459 
along so fast you don't really hear it
the<00:06:18.879> other<00:06:18.999> neat<00:06:19.240> feature<00:06:19.479> the<00:06:19.719> drive<00:06:19.959> has<00:06:20.229> is

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:20.469 
the other neat feature the drive has is

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:23.429 
the other neat feature the drive has is
this<00:06:20.589> other<00:06:20.829> switch<00:06:21.249> which<00:06:21.909> controls<00:06:22.509> auto

00:06:23.429 --> 00:06:23.439 
this other switch which controls auto

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:25.350 
this other switch which controls auto
exposure<00:06:23.889> bracketing<00:06:24.099> you<00:06:24.610> can<00:06:24.759> adjust<00:06:25.149> the

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
exposure bracketing you can adjust the

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.569 
exposure bracketing you can adjust the
exposure<00:06:25.599> bracketing<00:06:26.050> by<00:06:26.529> half<00:06:26.829> stop<00:06:27.159> from

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:27.579 
exposure bracketing by half stop from

00:06:27.579 --> 00:06:30.420 
exposure bracketing by half stop from
plus<00:06:27.879> minus<00:06:28.269> 1/2<00:06:28.569> to<00:06:28.930> plus<00:06:29.169> minus<00:06:29.499> a<00:06:29.649> full<00:06:29.829> stop

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430 
plus minus 1/2 to plus minus a full stop

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.759 
plus minus 1/2 to plus minus a full stop
I<00:06:30.459> think<00:06:30.969> my<00:06:31.089> batteries<00:06:31.839> given<00:06:32.499> that<00:06:32.529> they're

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:32.769 
I think my batteries given that they're

00:06:32.769 --> 00:06:35.100 
I think my batteries given that they're
pretty<00:06:32.979> old<00:06:33.039> this<00:06:33.369> is<00:06:33.550> a<00:06:33.579> camera<00:06:34.180> from<00:06:34.329> 96<00:06:34.959> I

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
pretty old this is a camera from 96 I

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.019 
pretty old this is a camera from 96 I
believe<00:06:35.409> so<00:06:36.069> the<00:06:36.189> batteries<00:06:36.550> are<00:06:36.699> probably

00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:37.029 
believe so the batteries are probably

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:40.170 
believe so the batteries are probably
also<00:06:37.180> from<00:06:37.509> 96<00:06:38.019> they're<00:06:38.889> on<00:06:39.009> their<00:06:39.669> last<00:06:39.849> leg

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.180 
also from 96 they're on their last leg

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.159 
also from 96 they're on their last leg
really<00:06:40.659> or<00:06:40.930> the<00:06:41.079> battery<00:06:41.379> is<00:06:41.529> on<00:06:41.680> its<00:06:41.829> last

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:42.169 
really or the battery is on its last

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:45.519 
really or the battery is on its last
really<00:06:43.330> so<00:06:44.330> I<00:06:44.360> can<00:06:44.659> get<00:06:44.810> a<00:06:44.840> few<00:06:45.020> rolls<00:06:45.229> of<00:06:45.349> film

00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:45.529 
really so I can get a few rolls of film

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:47.499 
really so I can get a few rolls of film
through<00:06:45.770> it<00:06:45.949> and<00:06:46.069> then<00:06:46.159> it<00:06:46.639> seems<00:06:46.909> to<00:06:47.120> deplete

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:47.509 
through it and then it seems to deplete

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:50.439 
through it and then it seems to deplete
pretty<00:06:47.779> quickly<00:06:48.879> these<00:06:49.879> days<00:06:50.029> you're<00:06:50.389> gonna

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449 
pretty quickly these days you're gonna

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:52.360 
pretty quickly these days you're gonna
have<00:06:50.719> to<00:06:50.870> get<00:06:51.050> the<00:06:51.289> battery<00:06:51.529> pack<00:06:51.770> custom-made

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.370 
have to get the battery pack custom-made

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.950 
have to get the battery pack custom-made
because<00:06:52.580> you<00:06:52.699> just<00:06:52.879> can't<00:06:53.120> buy<00:06:53.569> a<00:06:53.599> battery

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 
because you just can't buy a battery

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.809 
because you just can't buy a battery
pack<00:06:54.199> anywhere<00:06:54.710> for<00:06:54.949> this<00:06:55.069> thing<00:06:55.249> as<00:06:55.460> I<00:06:55.580> say

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520
