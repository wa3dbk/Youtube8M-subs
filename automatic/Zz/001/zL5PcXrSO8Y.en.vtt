think<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.560> band<00:01:43.770> deserved<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.189> go<00:01:44.280> through

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.609 
think the band deserved to go through
what<00:01:45.570> do<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.720> think<00:01:45.869> about<00:01:45.899> Merlin's<00:01:46.350> missed

penalty<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.310> last<00:01:47.640> minute<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.720> think<00:01:49.229> that

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
penalty in the last minute I think that

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.960 
penalty in the last minute I think that
that<00:01:49.560> cost<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:50.040> lot<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.220> people<00:01:50.549> quite<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.700> bit<00:01:50.880> of

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
that cost a lot of people quite a bit of

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.730 
that cost a lot of people quite a bit of
money<00:01:51.000> because<00:01:51.960> they<00:01:52.170> would<00:01:52.290> have<00:01:52.380> had<00:01:52.500> bets

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
money because they would have had bets

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.160 
money because they would have had bets
on<00:01:52.979> buy-ins<00:01:53.280> wins<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:53.909> comfortably<00:01:54.390> because

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
on buy-ins wins so comfortably because

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.380 
on buy-ins wins so comfortably because
the<00:01:55.320> odds<00:01:55.439> were<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:55.829> short<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.549> yeah<00:01:57.149> let<00:01:57.329> me
