00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
to go back to this new way of thinking

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.040 
to go back to this new way of thinking
so<00:02:05.310> anything<00:02:06.299> is<00:02:06.450> possible<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:08.539> in<00:02:09.539> these

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
so anything is possible in this in these

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.730 
so anything is possible in this in these
sections<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:11.150> science<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.360> this<00:02:13.080> is<00:02:13.200> where

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
sections of science and this is where

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.900 
sections of science and this is where
a<00:02:13.830> writer<00:02:14.310> or<00:02:14.700> somebody<00:02:15.600> like<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:16.550> my<00:02:17.550> medium

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
a writer or somebody like of my medium

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.700 
a writer or somebody like of my medium
can<00:02:18.720> literally<00:02:19.820> imagine<00:02:20.900> things<00:02:21.900> from

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
can literally imagine things from

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.800 
can literally imagine things from
anywhere<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.550> literally<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:24.240> could<00:02:24.570> make

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
anywhere and literally it could make

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.100 
anywhere and literally it could make
sense<00:02:25.200> out<00:02:25.470> in<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.220> future<00:02:26.580> it<00:02:27.360> could<00:02:27.660> hold<00:02:27.900> a

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
sense out in the future it could hold a

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.750 
sense out in the future it could hold a
deeper<00:02:28.410> meaning<00:02:28.530> further<00:02:29.100> down<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.400> line<00:02:29.520> it

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
deeper meaning further down the line it

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.400 
deeper meaning further down the line it
could<00:02:29.910> hold<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.240> meeting<00:02:30.390> right<00:02:30.630> now<00:02:30.690> in<00:02:31.140> a

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
could hold a meeting right now in a

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.310 
could hold a meeting right now in a

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
on a different you know star system it

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.510 
on a different you know star system it
may<00:02:37.200> actually<00:02:37.380> hold<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:37.980> things<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.490> I

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
may actually hold the things that I

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.280 
may actually hold the things that I
talked<00:02:38.760> about<00:02:38.790> in<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.240> novel<00:02:39.540> kai<00:02:39.840> Rox<00:02:40.020> the

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
talked about in the novel kai Rox the

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.070 
talked about in the novel kai Rox the
message<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.650> Pascal<00:02:41.390> about<00:02:42.390> this<00:02:42.690> mystical

literally is not of our planes but then

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.020 
literally is not of our planes but then
it<00:02:48.960> tells<00:02:49.170> us<00:02:49.380> it<00:02:49.680> tells<00:02:50.070> us<00:02:50.280> what<00:02:50.580> this<00:02:50.730> place

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
it tells us it tells us what this place

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.390 
it tells us it tells us what this place
is<00:02:51.060> what<00:02:51.480> universe<00:02:51.840> is<00:02:51.870> what<00:02:52.710> galaxies<00:02:53.190> is

are they you know how were they created

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.110 
are they you know how were they created
since<00:03:33.990> there's<00:03:34.200> above<00:03:34.650> everything<00:03:35.100> else<00:03:35.370> so

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120
