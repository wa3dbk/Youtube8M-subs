all<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.840> same<00:00:54.989> time<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:56.010> was<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.190> bit<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.730> a

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
all in the same time it was a bit of a

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.189 
all in the same time it was a bit of a
challenge<00:00:56.969> putting<00:00:57.449> all<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.780> display

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
small device with LEDs but we think

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.200 
small device with LEDs but we think
we've<00:01:02.250> done<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.399> pretty<00:01:02.520> good<00:01:02.640> job<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:03.059> is

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
we've done a pretty good job this is

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.820 
we've done a pretty good job this is
your<00:01:03.420> audio<00:01:03.930> level<00:01:04.229> meters<00:01:04.470> these<00:01:04.619> are<00:01:04.739> your

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
your audio level meters these are your

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.830 
your audio level meters these are your
battery<00:01:05.159> indicators<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.390> time<00:01:06.630> left

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
battery indicators this is the time left

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.440 
battery indicators this is the time left
on<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> disk<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.909> you<00:01:08.909> can<00:01:09.030> swap<00:01:09.299> between

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
on the disk and you can swap between

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.600 
on the disk and you can swap between
ProRes<00:01:10.170> flavors<00:01:10.590> by<00:01:10.740> holding<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.189> down<00:01:11.400> for

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
ProRes flavors by holding that down for

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.640 
ProRes flavors by holding that down for
a<00:01:11.640> couple<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.939> seconds<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:13.200> shows<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.530> when

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
a couple of seconds it shows you when

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.080 
a couple of seconds it shows you when
your<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> lot<00:01:13.979> you've<00:01:14.159> got<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.310> lock<00:01:14.490> signal<00:01:14.850> and

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
your a lot you've got a lock signal and

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.910 
your a lot you've got a lock signal and
we<00:01:15.330> also<00:01:15.479> do<00:01:15.689> two<00:01:16.110> two<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.439> three<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.710> pull

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
we also do two two and three to pull

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.350 
we also do two two and three to pull
down<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:17.909> go<00:01:18.030> back<00:01:18.240> to

in the box there's lots of mounting
options<00:01:26.520> we've<00:01:26.909> got<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.090> cheese<00:01:27.840> grater<00:01:27.869> plate

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
options we've got a cheese grater plate

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.399 
options we've got a cheese grater plate
that's<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.280> which<00:01:29.579> we<00:01:29.670> call<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.939> cheese<00:01:30.409> that

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
that's it which we call the cheese that

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.200 
that's it which we call the cheese that
sits<00:01:31.650> on<00:01:31.799> top<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:32.340> lets<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.640> mount<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:33.000> like

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
sits on top that lets you mount it like

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.270 
sits on top that lets you mount it like
traditionally<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.350> we<00:01:34.439> have<00:01:34.740> these<00:01:34.920> rubber

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
traditionally and we have these rubber

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.069 
traditionally and we have these rubber
straps<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.970> we<00:01:36.119> got<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.390> idea<00:01:36.540> from<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
straps that we got the idea from the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.289

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
bike lights you know you're riding your

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.240 
bike lights you know you're riding your
push<00:01:39.450> but<00:01:39.659> we<00:01:39.750> all<00:01:39.900> we<00:01:40.200> all<00:01:40.229> ride<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.740> work<00:01:40.920> so

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250
