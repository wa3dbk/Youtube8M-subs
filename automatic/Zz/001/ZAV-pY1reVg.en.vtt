00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.750
 hello and welcome once again to the 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:09.640
 hp store videos 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:14.440
 today we have a very interesting video 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:18.670
 this is like no longer being able to recognize 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.800
 the chronic model of s 4 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.580
 which is available in our store a 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.320
 real phone call is the call of 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.390
 with incredible features 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.420
 8 megapixel camera screen 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.390
 high resolution with a definition and a 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.980
 incredible color quality and today you 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.570
 let's show the performance of the 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.660
 phone 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.530
 okay good for buoyant color 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.530
 we go 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:50.710
 here you see it 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:56.790
 score high 13,276 points we are going to 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.790
 see points 13 276 and 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.660
 well now you will not see much 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.660
 to see what approach 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:18.200
 202 2311 of ram 3 meters in 86 of 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:21.460
 2.546 flow view cpu integration 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.200
 flow of how to translate it 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:29.780
 very good a very good score in 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:31.550
 the graphics in 3d a very score 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.150
 very good especially considering 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.140
 the 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.680
 the price we will do it again alone 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.400
 for you to see 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.550
 let's put it that way we focus 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:50.960
 and we're going to start the test and 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:52.070
 two to benchmark as you already know the test 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.500
 of altitude 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.250
 marc is a pretty test is a 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.740
 benchmark 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:03.220
 pretty popular 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.360
 Many terminals use it to 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.070
 good 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.149
 and make them see that they really are 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.810
 high performance phones 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.000
 13000 points is really a very good 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.960
 punctuation 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.240
 from a good phone is using the 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.230
 quad core 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.720
 a quad -core processor 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.230
 the mediatek brand 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:34.040
 and it's this processor has a core of 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.740
 water cores 7 that means it 's 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.160
 a processor that does very well the 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.520
 medium performance tasks is to say a 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.010
 processor that does tasks 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.490
 and quick that are not tasks either 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:53.840
 excessively high but it does so with a 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:56.930
 low consumption of cpu and battery iu 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.870
 so it's a phone that will keep the 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:04.540
 battery and now the usual tasks of 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.540
 the habitual users some play 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.580
 well here we can before two of 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.920
 play 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.480
 whatsapp most applications os 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.480
 they will be very fluid without any kind of 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.480
 problem 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.020
 and the processor is going to take them 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.580
 handle very well and apart is going to do it 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.770
 in a way that does not consume as much 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.460
 battery you are now in a test 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.460
 particles 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.080
 and a 33 of now there are not a few 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.470
 gentlemen 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.470
 unloading pits 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:48.620
 before open gl actually 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:51.410
 another test of polygons 3d 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:55.870
 and we can see an orc 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.870
 and already giving of hosts 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.350
 Well, there is not much left to the test I imagine 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.050
 what 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.100
 minutes two minutes 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.100
 13 still 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.690
 but good you can look in 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:14.319
 Internet and the tests of the 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:17.169
 slow benchmarks are easy and 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.700
 you can see that in many terminals what 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.459
 they have almost all the big ones 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.139
 brands also have have facts of the 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:26.130
 great tutu benchmark so you can 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.130
 compare a little 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.900
 87% this will end quickly 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:40.229
 well you know that it is the s4 that is the 

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:44.849
 clone of ls 4 that we are the first to 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:46.439
 have them this clone this model that is 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:49.969
 the truth is being sold 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:53.989
 selling very well and is for something to 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:53.989
 see is very good phone 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.249
 good you see that the screen darkens us 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.199
 when turning it 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:04.819
 these things are not taken into account in 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.729
 they would not be taken into account in the 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:09.379
 benchmark the camera that also has 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:13.190
 a very good 8 megapixel camera 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:15.020
 he really has some pretty pictures 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.640
 good is a phone to enjoy 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.640
 come on if you like phones 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.860
 this is your real phone 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:27.710
 apart from that it is beautiful it has a high 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.340
 performance and visually and photos 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.060
 is 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.300
 Excellent 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:40.400
 well there we are has now given us a 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:42.530
 score of 13 thousand three points good 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.060
 what happens because a 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.060
 little bit good we would have some 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:51.310
 open application or something else 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.310
 that or the cache would not be emptied 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.370
 but good is 13,000 points 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:00.409
 Well, let's go 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.399
 pass the score to the internet 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:05.929
 that everyone can consult it 

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:09.289
 Well I hope you liked the 

00:06:05.929 --> 00:06:11.989
 video and you know we have phones 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:15.080
 of high performance and we hope to see you 

00:06:11.989 --> 00:06:18.349
 nÃ©stor so see if you become 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:23.019
 one of our favorite clients as well
