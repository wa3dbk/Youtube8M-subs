00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.940 

you<00:02:00.670> don't<00:02:00.909> and<00:02:01.240> wife<00:02:01.420> is<00:02:01.869> feeling<00:02:02.229> very<00:02:02.530> very

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.309 
you don't and wife is feeling very very
difficult<00:02:03.280> to<00:02:06.000> disorient<00:02:07.170> defeating<00:02:08.170> this

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
difficult to disorient defeating this

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.690 
difficult to disorient defeating this
stretcher<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:11.110> I<00:02:11.140> guess<00:02:11.350> you<00:02:11.590> obviously<00:02:12.220> solid

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
stretcher so I guess you obviously solid

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.740 
stretcher so I guess you obviously solid
and<00:02:12.910> that<00:02:13.120> is<00:02:13.300> just<00:02:14.280> very<00:02:15.280> shocking<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:18.750> yeah

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
and that is just very shocking and yeah

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.140 
and that is just very shocking and yeah
that<00:02:20.020> that<00:02:20.350> that<00:02:20.739> monster<00:02:20.950> is<00:02:21.400> is<00:02:21.700> proving

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
that that that monster is is proving

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.000 
that that that monster is is proving
very<00:02:22.270> difficult<00:02:22.540> at<00:02:23.170> one<00:02:23.410> point<00:02:23.440> you're

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
very difficult at one point you're

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.420 
very difficult at one point you're
dealing<00:02:24.400> with<00:02:24.430> not<00:02:24.910> only<00:02:24.940> just<00:02:25.300> that<00:02:26.130> now<00:02:27.130> it

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
dealing with not only just that now it

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.590 
dealing with not only just that now it
is<00:02:28.209> there<00:02:28.750> it<00:02:29.140> ate<00:02:29.500> it<00:02:30.280> ate<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.820> or<00:02:31.000> talk<00:02:31.180> it<00:02:31.420> it

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
is there it ate it ate it or talk it it

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.130 
is there it ate it ate it or talk it it
is<00:02:32.050> also<00:02:32.350> creating<00:02:32.769> a<00:02:32.830> shield<00:02:33.100> for<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:33.489> and

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
is also creating a shield for it and

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.840 
is also creating a shield for it and
it's<00:02:35.140> going<00:02:35.350> to<00:02:35.410> be<00:02:35.500> proving<00:02:36.130> very<00:02:36.160> hard<00:02:36.700> to

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
it's going to be proving very hard to

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.120 
it's going to be proving very hard to
until<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:37.540> because<00:02:37.930> every<00:02:38.140> time<00:02:38.350> it<00:02:38.860> go<00:02:39.070> to

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
until it because every time it go to

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.370 
until it because every time it go to
look<00:02:39.310> shield<00:02:39.580> and<00:02:39.910> then<00:02:40.840> you're<00:02:41.019> not<00:02:41.080> only

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
look shield and then you're not only

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.600 
look shield and then you're not only
dealing<00:02:41.620> with<00:02:41.800> that<00:02:42.069> you're<00:02:42.310> dealing<00:02:42.489> with

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
dealing with that you're dealing with

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.540 
dealing with that you're dealing with
something<00:02:42.910> over<00:02:43.209> around<00:02:43.510> it<00:02:44.220> well<00:02:45.220> by<00:02:45.340> that's

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
something over around it well by that's

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.640 
something over around it well by that's
how<00:02:45.730> I<00:02:45.760> shoot<00:02:46.060> you<00:02:46.239> or<00:02:46.510> to<00:02:46.690> ship<00:02:46.870> that<00:02:47.110> that's

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
how I shoot you or to ship that that's

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:59.220 
how I shoot you or to ship that that's
pressured<00:02:48.069> like<00:02:48.250> something<00:02:48.910> like<00:02:49.030> this

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.869 

that<00:03:00.230> could<00:03:00.439> be<00:03:00.470> potently<00:03:00.980> very<00:03:01.250> helpful<00:03:01.849> in

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
that could be potently very helpful in

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.000 
that could be potently very helpful in
some<00:03:02.209> ways<00:03:02.450> that<00:03:02.480> it<00:03:03.019> could<00:03:03.290> easily<00:03:03.500> help<00:03:03.890> me

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
some ways that it could easily help me

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.420 
some ways that it could easily help me
taking<00:03:04.340> advantage<00:03:04.849> to<00:03:05.060> defeating<00:03:05.720> this<00:03:05.930> thing

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
taking advantage to defeating this thing

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.470 
taking advantage to defeating this thing
but<00:03:07.430> that<00:03:07.879> could<00:03:08.090> take<00:03:08.120> it<00:03:08.299> such<00:03:08.870> a<00:03:09.200> white

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
but that could take it such a white

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:18.430 
but that could take it such a white
weapon<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:11.659> do<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:12.310> and<00:03:16.390> this<00:03:17.390> dresser<00:03:18.110> the

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
weapon to do it and this dresser the

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.949 
weapon to do it and this dresser the
structure<00:03:18.739> whether<00:03:19.099> you<00:03:19.280> like<00:03:19.459> the<00:03:19.940> Sun<00:03:20.180> the

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
structure whether you like the Sun the

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.970 
structure whether you like the Sun the
same<00:03:21.200> just<00:03:21.379> go<00:03:21.440> around<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.709> gardens<00:03:22.040> rushers

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
same just go around the gardens rushers

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.369 
same just go around the gardens rushers
it<00:03:24.980> has<00:03:25.310> this<00:03:25.700> tentacle<00:03:26.299> that<00:03:26.870> basically

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:27.379 
it has this tentacle that basically

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.580 
it has this tentacle that basically
reach<00:03:27.829> like<00:03:28.609> what<00:03:29.000> 10<00:03:29.299> feet<00:03:29.599> away<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:30.260> kept

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
reach like what 10 feet away and kept

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:38.530 
reach like what 10 feet away and kept
smacking<00:03:31.190> you<00:03:36.310> secondly<00:03:37.310> it<00:03:37.489> shows<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:38.030> spike

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
smacking you secondly it shows the spike

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.240 
smacking you secondly it shows the spike
or<00:03:38.840> whatever<00:03:39.139> is<00:03:39.319> shooting<00:03:39.620> the<00:03:39.739> ball<00:03:39.920> the<00:03:40.129> way

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
or whatever is shooting the ball the way

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.660 
or whatever is shooting the ball the way
hit<00:03:40.730> you<00:03:40.909> now<00:03:41.569> is<00:03:41.810> it<00:03:41.840> you<00:03:42.769> get<00:03:42.950> hit<00:03:43.220> like<00:03:43.250> that

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
hit you now is it you get hit like that

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.569 
hit you now is it you get hit like that
thing<00:03:44.000> and<00:03:44.180> hits<00:03:44.359> a<00:03:44.480> ball<00:03:44.690> that's<00:03:44.930> spiked<00:03:45.579> to

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
thing and hits a ball that's spiked to

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.030 
thing and hits a ball that's spiked to
head<00:03:46.909> for<00:03:47.150> one<00:03:47.389> hit<00:03:47.659> basically<00:03:48.290> you<00:03:48.440> shield<00:03:48.739> is

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
head for one hit basically you shield is

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.289 
head for one hit basically you shield is
break<00:03:49.489> down<00:03:50.139> or<00:03:51.280> if<00:03:52.280> you<00:03:52.400> get<00:03:52.519> hit<00:03:52.670> by<00:03:52.790> more<00:03:53.120> of

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
break down or if you get hit by more of

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.369 
break down or if you get hit by more of
that<00:03:54.040> they<00:03:55.040> probably<00:03:55.250> would<00:03:55.670> damage<00:03:56.450> you<00:03:56.750> if

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
that they probably would damage you if
