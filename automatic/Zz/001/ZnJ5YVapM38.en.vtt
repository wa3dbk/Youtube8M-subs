experience many inventors don't really

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:41.040 
experience many inventors don't really
have<00:00:39.970> much<00:00:40.090> of<00:00:40.120> a<00:00:40.300> business<00:00:40.600> background<00:00:40.809> they

appeal to people hmm do you find that

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.580 
appeal to people hmm do you find that
most<00:01:45.579> inventors<00:01:46.030> are<00:01:46.210> warm<00:01:46.960> up<00:01:47.140> to<00:01:47.290> the<00:01:47.380> fact

most inventors are warm up to the fact

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.539 
most inventors are warm up to the fact
that<00:01:47.619> they<00:01:47.770> have<00:01:47.860> to<00:01:47.950> work<00:01:48.100> with<00:01:48.250> a<00:01:48.280> lot<00:01:48.460> of

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
that they have to work with a lot of

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:49.890 
that they have to work with a lot of
different<00:01:48.579> people<00:01:48.909> or<00:01:49.240> do<00:01:49.329> you<00:01:49.390> find<00:01:49.600> various

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
different people or do you find various

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.890 
different people or do you find various
different<00:01:50.229> reactions<00:01:50.680> from<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.040> inventors

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
different reactions from the inventors

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.740 
different reactions from the inventors
personalities<00:01:52.900> or<00:01:53.140> everywhere<00:01:53.950> and<00:01:54.220> I<00:01:55.030> really

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
personalities or everywhere and I really

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.480 
personalities or everywhere and I really
think<00:01:55.900> it<00:01:56.079> comes<00:01:56.259> down<00:01:56.470> when<00:01:56.680> you<00:01:56.770> do<00:01:56.979> when

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
think it comes down when you do when

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.039 
think it comes down when you do when
you're<00:01:57.670> when<00:01:57.790> you're<00:01:57.909> matching<00:01:58.180> and<00:01:58.600> inventor

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
you're when you're matching and inventor

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.920 
you're when you're matching and inventor
or<00:01:59.350> a<00:01:59.380> small<00:01:59.680> business<00:02:00.130> with<00:02:00.790> investors<00:02:01.750> I

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
or a small business with investors I

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.649 
or a small business with investors I
think<00:02:02.829> the<00:02:02.920> personality<00:02:03.549> match<00:02:03.790> is<00:02:04.149> important

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
think the personality match is important

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.560 
think the personality match is important
there<00:02:04.899> as<00:02:05.140> it<00:02:05.649> is<00:02:05.740> anywhere<00:02:06.159> else<00:02:06.340> hmm<00:02:06.820> is

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
there as it is anywhere else hmm is

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.969 
there as it is anywhere else hmm is
there<00:02:07.869> ever<00:02:07.990> concerned<00:02:08.410> with<00:02:08.649> these<00:02:08.769> small

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
there ever concerned with these small

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.440 
there ever concerned with these small
inventors<00:02:09.190> about<00:02:09.519> relinquishing<00:02:09.910> control

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
inventors about relinquishing control

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.080 
inventors about relinquishing control
and<00:02:10.989> how<00:02:11.170> do<00:02:11.230> you<00:02:11.290> go<00:02:11.500> about<00:02:11.760> calming<00:02:12.760> those

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
and how do you go about calming those

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
and how do you go about calming those
fears<00:02:13.680> some<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.190> inventors<00:02:15.730> are

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
fears some of the inventors are

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.720 
fears some of the inventors are

wants to raise 10 million dollars for

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.080 
wants to raise 10 million dollars for
the<00:03:32.320> purpose<00:03:32.680> of<00:03:32.710> creating<00:03:33.460> a<00:03:33.580> product<00:03:33.820> that

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
the purpose of creating a product that

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.030 
the purpose of creating a product that
dies<00:03:34.540> fabric<00:03:35.200> from<00:03:35.380> one<00:03:35.560> color<00:03:35.770> to<00:03:35.860> another

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
dies fabric from one color to another

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.610 
dies fabric from one color to another
and<00:03:36.850> that<00:03:37.570> seems<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:38.020> little<00:03:38.080> unrealistic

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
and that seems a little unrealistic

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.820 
and that seems a little unrealistic
sometimes<00:03:39.220> so<00:03:40.120> you<00:03:40.570> want<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:40.960> you<00:03:41.440> want<00:03:41.650> the

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
sometimes so you want the you want the

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.460 
sometimes so you want the you want the
the<00:03:42.190> amount<00:03:42.520> of<00:03:42.610> the<00:03:42.760> financing<00:03:43.480> that's<00:03:44.200> being

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
the amount of the financing that's being

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.640 
the amount of the financing that's being
sought<00:03:44.770> to<00:03:45.370> relate<00:03:45.760> some<00:03:46.060> hell<00:03:46.320> 22<00:03:47.320> what<00:03:47.500> the

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
sought to relate some hell 22 what the

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.860 
sought to relate some hell 22 what the
actual<00:03:47.980> business<00:03:48.610> is<00:03:48.910> supposed<00:03:49.210> to<00:03:49.330> be<00:03:49.450> either

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
actual business is supposed to be either

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.480 
actual business is supposed to be either
and<00:03:50.080> I<00:03:50.350> think<00:03:50.620> that's<00:03:50.800> one<00:03:51.070> of<00:03:51.100> the<00:03:51.280> biggest

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
and I think that's one of the biggest

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.630 
and I think that's one of the biggest
problems<00:03:52.060> is<00:03:52.350> getting<00:03:53.350> a<00:03:53.440> match<00:03:53.800> a<00:03:54.040> realistic

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
problems is getting a match a realistic

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.030 
problems is getting a match a realistic
match<00:03:54.850> between<00:03:55.300> the<00:03:55.600> viability<00:03:56.500> of<00:03:56.530> the

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
match between the viability of the

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.400 
match between the viability of the
product<00:03:57.460> or<00:03:57.580> the<00:03:57.610> service<00:03:57.870> and<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:58.930> amount<00:03:59.290> of

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
product or the service and the amount of

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.410 
product or the service and the amount of
money<00:03:59.740> than<00:03:59.980> it<00:04:00.070> would<00:04:00.190> be<00:04:00.430> that<00:04:01.150> would<00:04:01.270> be

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
money than it would be that would be

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.720 
money than it would be that would be
required<00:04:01.660> to<00:04:01.930> finance<00:04:02.410> that<00:04:02.500> mm-hmm<00:04:03.070> any

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
required to finance that mm-hmm any

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.550 
required to finance that mm-hmm any
other<00:04:04.270> indicators<00:04:05.050> you<00:04:05.140> look<00:04:05.290> for<00:04:05.470> or

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
other indicators you look for or

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.690 
other indicators you look for or
anything<00:04:05.590> else<00:04:05.950> you<00:04:06.070> try<00:04:06.220> to<00:04:06.280> do<00:04:06.430> when<00:04:06.580> you

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
anything else you try to do when you

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.170 
anything else you try to do when you
work<00:04:07.210> with<00:04:07.240> these<00:04:07.480> people<00:04:07.810> well<00:04:08.080> I<00:04:08.320> think<00:04:09.180> if

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
work with these people well I think if

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.750 
work with these people well I think if
you<00:04:10.390> if<00:04:10.600> you<00:04:10.720> have<00:04:10.930> an<00:04:11.650> inventor<00:04:12.190> who<00:04:12.340> has<00:04:12.550> been
