fingerprint I'd like that very much a
fingerprint<00:03:20.329> magnet<00:03:20.590> but<00:03:21.590> HP<00:03:22.010> does<00:03:22.280> in<00:03:22.430> fact

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
fingerprint magnet but HP does in fact

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.120 
fingerprint magnet but HP does in fact
include<00:03:23.209> a<00:03:23.359> cloth<00:03:23.840> so<00:03:24.260> that<00:03:24.290> you<00:03:24.620> can<00:03:24.769> screen

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
include a cloth so that you can screen

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.509

clean<00:03:25.609> that<00:03:25.850> for<00:03:26.150> you

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.440 

see<00:03:29.519> what<00:03:29.909> else<00:03:30.060> should<00:03:30.209> I<00:03:30.269> go<00:03:30.480> over<00:03:30.569> I<00:03:30.870> add<00:03:31.110> the

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
see what else should I go over I add the

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.330 
see what else should I go over I add the
speakers<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.720> are<00:03:33.750> on<00:03:33.959> this<00:03:34.110> are<00:03:34.799> pretty

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
speakers that are on this are pretty

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.690 
speakers that are on this are pretty
decent<00:03:36.620> they<00:03:37.620> aren't<00:03:37.829> the<00:03:37.920> best<00:03:38.069> are<00:03:38.310> made<00:03:38.489> by

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
decent they aren't the best are made by

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.199 
decent they aren't the best are made by
altec<00:03:39.450> lansing<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:39.930> they<00:03:40.140> had<00:03:40.500> SRS<00:03:41.430> premium

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
altec lansing and they had SRS premium

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.069 
altec lansing and they had SRS premium
sound<00:03:43.220> but<00:03:44.239> they<00:03:45.239> really<00:03:45.450> don't<00:03:45.569> have<00:03:46.049> that

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
sound but they really don't have that

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.380 
sound but they really don't have that
much<00:03:46.349> bass<00:03:46.680> like<00:03:46.920> the<00:03:47.040> higher-end<00:03:47.519> dv7<00:03:48.450> does

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
much bass like the higher-end dv7 does

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.440 
much bass like the higher-end dv7 does
that<00:03:51.390> bitch<00:03:51.659> has<00:03:51.840> a<00:03:51.900> built-in<00:03:52.319> subwoofer<00:03:52.590> but

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
that bitch has a built-in subwoofer but

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.449 
that bitch has a built-in subwoofer but
something<00:03:54.450> that<00:03:54.480> i'll<00:03:54.720> show<00:03:54.930> you<00:03:55.049> here<00:03:55.530> is<00:03:57.349> the

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
something that i'll show you here is the

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:04.069 
something that i'll show you here is the
windows<00:04:00.590> experience<00:04:01.590> index<00:04:02.569> some<00:04:03.569> and<00:04:03.900> this

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
windows experience index some and this

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:08.899 
windows experience index some and this
being<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.470> lowest<00:04:04.950> end<00:04:05.190> core<00:04:05.549> i3<00:04:07.909> really

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
being the lowest end core i3 really

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.509 
being the lowest end core i3 really
shows<00:04:09.239> you<00:04:09.450> how<00:04:09.629> good<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.139> i<00:04:10.859> series

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
shows you how good the i series

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.030 
shows you how good the i series
processors<00:04:12.180> are<00:04:12.389> even<00:04:13.260> though<00:04:13.379> it<00:04:13.560> only<00:04:13.590> has<00:04:14.010> a

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
processors are even though it only has a

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.740 
processors are even though it only has a
4.2<00:04:14.790> rating<00:04:15.209> the<00:04:16.049> i3<00:04:16.590> processor<00:04:17.310> has<00:04:17.639> a<00:04:17.750> rating

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
4.2 rating the i3 processor has a rating

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.500 
4.2 rating the i3 processor has a rating
of<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:19.019> 6.2<00:04:21.470> which<00:04:22.470> is<00:04:23.280> fairly<00:04:23.880> incredible

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
of the 6.2 which is fairly incredible

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.510 
of the 6.2 which is fairly incredible
for<00:04:25.080> a<00:04:25.110> base<00:04:25.530> end<00:04:25.979> processor<00:04:27.650> so<00:04:28.650> i'll<00:04:29.310> go<00:04:29.490> over

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
for a base end processor so i'll go over

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.480 
for a base end processor so i'll go over
a<00:04:29.639> processor<00:04:30.380> 6.2<00:04:31.380> ram<00:04:32.690> 5.9<00:04:33.949> graphics<00:04:34.949> for

a processor 6.2 ram 5.9 graphics for

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.760 
a processor 6.2 ram 5.9 graphics for
windows<00:04:35.820> are<00:04:36.000> 4.2<00:04:36.840> that<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.199> lowest<00:04:37.410> score

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
windows are 4.2 that the lowest score

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.420 
windows are 4.2 that the lowest score
still<00:04:38.130> not<00:04:38.310> a<00:04:38.340> bad<00:04:38.580> score<00:04:38.910> gaming<00:04:39.750> graphics

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
still not a bad score gaming graphics

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.450 
still not a bad score gaming graphics
4.9<00:04:41.430> it's<00:04:41.699> actually<00:04:42.030> fairly<00:04:42.210> good<00:04:42.570> for<00:04:42.810> an
