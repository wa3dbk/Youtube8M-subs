like that and it's pretty expensive and

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.660 
like that and it's pretty expensive and
I<00:01:01.080> think<00:01:01.470> this<00:01:01.560> is<00:01:01.710> campos<00:01:02.130> actually<00:01:02.520> probably

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
I think this is campos actually probably

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.850 
I think this is campos actually probably
a<00:01:02.850> little<00:01:03.180> more<00:01:03.360> affordable<00:01:03.930> he<00:01:04.470> didn't<00:01:04.680> want

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
to get out he wanted to stay and I think

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.390 
to get out he wanted to stay and I think
even<00:01:07.230> asked<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.740> people<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.130> threw<00:01:08.280> the
