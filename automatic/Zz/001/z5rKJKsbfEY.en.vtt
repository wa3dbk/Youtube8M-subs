00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
anyway I originally made this room

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.690 
anyway I originally made this room
because<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.750> wanted<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.320> have<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.799> test<00:01:20.490> out<00:01:20.670> of

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
because I wanted to have a test out of

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.460 
because I wanted to have a test out of
water<00:01:20.970> elevator<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.659> goes<00:01:21.720> straight<00:01:22.080> up<00:01:22.140> but

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
water elevator that goes straight up but

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.800 
water elevator that goes straight up but
I<00:01:22.530> found<00:01:22.890> out<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.159> straight<00:01:23.549> up<00:01:23.580> wasn't<00:01:24.509> high

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
I found out that straight up wasn't high

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.440 
I found out that straight up wasn't high
enough<00:01:25.460> so<00:01:26.460> I'm<00:01:26.520> gonna<00:01:26.610> instead<00:01:27.150> build<00:01:27.330> it

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
enough so I'm gonna instead build it

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.850 
enough so I'm gonna instead build it
over<00:01:27.630> here<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.930> just<00:01:28.170> converted<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.560> into<00:01:28.619> an

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
over here I just converted that into an

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.340 
over here I just converted that into an
infinity<00:01:29.250> pool<00:01:29.780> infinity<00:01:30.780> pool<00:01:30.930> basically

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
infinity pool infinity pool basically

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.350 
infinity pool infinity pool basically
