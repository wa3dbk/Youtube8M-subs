00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.650
 and the vehicle stand out from 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.049

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.510
 There are many ways for this to happen and the market

 airbrushing body elements all this 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.619
 a long time reality however today is our

 first of all on vinyl wrapping 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.160
 film recorded owners of new 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.100
 cars 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.559
 plus is that itâ€™s a solid 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.930
 covering the original form ie 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.789
 when the factory car left you can 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.120
 get used to in principle not strong 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.270
 The printer in another machine will save the film 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.640
 also small sandblasting chemistry that is 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.579
 sunny fucked chick whose 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.949

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.180
 paint protection 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.580
 for example, how is this machine worth 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.350
 ten and a half million rubles 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.790
 however, the field for applying autovinyl 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.280
 external elements 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.140
 not limited to use 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.000
 automotive film is appropriate not only 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.619
 for body work for example 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.830
 with it you can change up 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.479
 unrecognizable cabin items 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.820
 manufacturers of auto films today mass

 usa germany france 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.140
 China however according to experts 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.820
 heaven to do quality 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.579
 Avtovinil not yet learned 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.290
 swollen film bubbles clear 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.020
 sign of bad material or 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.869
 illiterate response but even if the film 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.680
 worthy top self-respecting service station 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.700
 after pasting conduct quality control 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.300
 own car came on 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.120
 control inspection 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.190
 when we glue the car on 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.440
 one week the owner should come 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.400
 on a control inspection so we inspected 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.750
 Does the car have some drawbacks 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.850
 remove their film just should 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.880
 period shrinks somewhere maybe 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.220
 emotional quality assurance and clicks 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.990
 car service give a year for quality 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.450
 The film itself is given a guarantee 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.180
 manufacturer and it can reach 10 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.370
 years the advantage of good vinyl is also in 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.440
 that its color range is wider than 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.320
 paint assortment and flight for 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.510
 creativity is huge machine I own 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.630
 more than two years the car was originally 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:29.290
 was black 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.830
 tired of these constant polishing here 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.830
 after our 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.300
 our own sinks are our dirt 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:41.790
 constantly that is here you have more than a month 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:45.870
 could not stand and it was decided 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.970
 tighten his film the choice fell on 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.520
 initially on the edge of the film from 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.500
 mirror effect is usually on 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.390
 The pasting of the car takes 4 days 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.210
 however, with complex elements 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.830
 the process can be delayed for a week if 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.810
 new color is different from the old 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.550
 paint something doorways better not 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.850
 paste over otherwise have to make 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.720
 changes in TCP cars 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.240
 automotive film is by no means 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.810
 prerogative of costly and exclusive 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.360
 auto 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:18.210
 if the car likes that no matter how much 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.210
 and years of twist change the image you can always
