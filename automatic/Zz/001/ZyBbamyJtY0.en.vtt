00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.680 
really cool feature to have because you
really<00:05:24.370> shouldn't<00:05:24.610> text<00:05:24.880> when<00:05:25.000> you<00:05:25.060> drive<00:05:25.300> and

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
really shouldn't text when you drive and

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.050 
really shouldn't text when you drive and
it's<00:05:26.140> difficult<00:05:26.920> not<00:05:27.160> to<00:05:27.220> be<00:05:27.550> using<00:05:27.940> this

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
it's difficult not to be using this

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.550 
it's difficult not to be using this
phone<00:05:28.300> all<00:05:28.630> the<00:05:28.660> time<00:05:28.810> when<00:05:29.140> you<00:05:29.230> have<00:05:29.380> it

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
phone all the time when you have it

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.830 
phone all the time when you have it
solely<00:05:30.310> because<00:05:30.550> it's<00:05:31.090> just<00:05:31.210> such<00:05:31.540> a<00:05:31.570> fun

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
solely because it's just such a fun

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.640 
solely because it's just such a fun
phone<00:05:32.850> so<00:05:33.850> the<00:05:34.210> specs<00:05:34.450> aside<00:05:34.810> once<00:05:35.290> again<00:05:35.560> the

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
phone so the specs aside once again the

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.350 
phone so the specs aside once again the
camera<00:05:36.040> is<00:05:36.100> really<00:05:36.370> great<00:05:36.580> I<00:05:36.820> like<00:05:37.090> the<00:05:37.240> design

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
right here with the Reds with the red

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.040 
right here with the Reds with the red
ear<00:05:39.280> piece<00:05:39.520> and<00:05:39.820> the<00:05:40.360> red<00:05:40.510> around<00:05:40.720> the<00:05:40.840> camera

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
ear piece and the red around the camera

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.500 
ear piece and the red around the camera
it<00:05:41.890> definitely<00:05:42.220> the<00:05:42.550> back<00:05:42.730> is<00:05:42.940> a<00:05:43.000> little<00:05:43.150> weird

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
it definitely the back is a little weird

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.880 
it definitely the back is a little weird
some<00:05:43.900> people<00:05:44.140> have<00:05:44.260> had<00:05:44.380> some<00:05:44.560> issues<00:05:44.860> with

that I don't I'd actually I put a case

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:48.750 
that I don't I'd actually I put a case
on<00:05:47.590> it<00:05:47.650> as<00:05:47.890> you<00:05:47.919> should<00:05:48.250> with<00:05:48.370> these<00:05:48.490> phones

it these are really nice phones these

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.940 
it these are really nice phones these
days<00:05:52.570> so<00:05:52.990> you<00:05:53.050> really<00:05:53.320> want<00:05:53.500> to<00:05:53.560> keep<00:05:53.710> them<00:05:53.860> in

days so you really want to keep them in

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.740 
days so you really want to keep them in
good<00:05:53.980> condition<00:05:54.580> especially<00:05:55.360> because<00:05:55.480> they

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
good condition especially because they

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.150 
good condition especially because they
have<00:05:55.840> a<00:05:55.870> really<00:05:56.140> good<00:05:56.260> trading<00:05:56.560> value<00:05:56.740> for

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
have a really good trading value for

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.040 
have a really good trading value for
when<00:05:57.310> you<00:05:57.490> do<00:05:58.210> eventually<00:05:58.510> want<00:05:58.840> to<00:05:58.900> upgrade

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
when you do eventually want to upgrade

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.100 
when you do eventually want to upgrade
and<00:05:59.820> does<00:06:00.820> it<00:06:00.970> a<00:06:01.030> camcorder<00:06:01.270> which<00:06:01.750> is<00:06:01.900> really

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
and does it a camcorder which is really

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.659 
and does it a camcorder which is really
great<00:06:02.290> as<00:06:02.530> well<00:06:02.560> though<00:06:02.950> it<00:06:03.040> takes<00:06:03.190> a<00:06:03.370> memory

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
great as well though it takes a memory

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.150 
great as well though it takes a memory
the<00:06:04.360> internal<00:06:04.750> memory<00:06:05.050> is<00:06:05.200> 8<00:06:05.380> gigabytes<00:06:05.860> I

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
the internal memory is 8 gigabytes I

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.340 
the internal memory is 8 gigabytes I
think<00:06:06.700> actually<00:06:06.820> six<00:06:07.180> point<00:06:07.450> four<00:06:07.780> gigabytes

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
think actually six point four gigabytes

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.200 
think actually six point four gigabytes
are<00:06:08.530> actually<00:06:08.830> open<00:06:08.980> not<00:06:09.610> you<00:06:09.940> know<00:06:10.060> without

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210
