 and very good of all here from une 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.250
 is one again and good today I come to you 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:09.250
 with a tutorial 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.120
 I'm going to show you how to make a 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.940
 homemade crossbow with two paper clips 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:21.180
 OK 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.180
 this we have to put the rubber band here 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:28.749
 and teach how it works 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.749
 and that you have 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:39.720
 and shoot vale 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:41.820
 what do we need we need a bic pen 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.940
 the moment 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.329
 one of these we are going to remove the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.780
 stop this up here and the mine 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.460
 inside that you only have the plastic 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.220
 as you see here 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.540
 OK 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.320
 following 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.579
 you have to choose 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.579
 a piece of paper 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.630
 in pieces of paper and 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.840
 he rolls it jce 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.680
 OK 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.400
 I'll roll up well 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.330
 manna that will be 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.940
 and we count a little bit because I do not think 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.940
 that is so side 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:07.330
 and here we have to check 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.330
 chin we have to check what happens 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.300
 As you can see here I did not have a very good time 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.500
 still without thinking well 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.350
 now yes for what you have to do 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.180
 this is how you have put one 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:46.230
 here that has to be more finite like 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.599
 you see and you put it here 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.330
 You put zeal do not make it too strong 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.780
 because if you put it, it will be very strong 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.780
 pass this 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:02.310
 then over here it's going to happen less if 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.310
 it crushes a lot can be this 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.700
 and then 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.700
 we take two clips 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.530
 we open that 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:20.470
 we open the other and this 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.470
 we doubled this we do it twice 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.780
 we already have 2 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.530
 what we have to do is we have the 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.340
 two clips here and these two the 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.230
 we have to join 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:43.150
 with zeal 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.150
 as you see here these 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.830
 for the big dream this the two clips 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:54.260
 they are introduced here inside 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.260
 now here inside the tube 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:03.300
 and tie a rubber to one end 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.300
 and we think about it 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.130
 and we grabbed it from the other end 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.989
 and now we have the rubber band now what 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.489
 what we have to do is a hole here 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.489
 to go from song to song 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.030
 that with 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.470
 with a 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:30.680
 with a knife you can do 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:34.280
 and good the following to do the 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.700
 trigger as you see the trigger here what 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:41.330
 you have to do is double here 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:44.439
 Part of this well worth 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.439
 and this part 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.759
 point 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:58.419
 I will repeat this is without this is 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:05:02.680
 just down and this is slipper 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:04.580
 ok and it was enough to put the trigger 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.599
 without 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.759
 inside that sticks out a bit and you 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:13.430
 You put zeal here as you have seen 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:16.770
 just a little bit because if you do it 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:19.819
 more like that then so 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.819
 the toothpick is not going 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:26.040
 will not do anything worth it because now what 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.040
 show the rubber 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.219
 you see the moment 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:37.860
 AOM is up here 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.860
 and clear and the toothpick 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.340
 I would be down here and I do it over here and 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:49.210
 a minute ago to camarillo so that 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:51.690
 it has to be like that 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.690
 yes 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.220
 without any small value 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:04.540
 Well, we do not have the short ones, I've already 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:04.540
 said that we put zeal here it's worth 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.800
 and once we have put zeal it will already be 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:13.689
 our 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.259
 is it finished 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:16.259
 OK 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:23.900
 just a moment 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.900
 which I have brought me no 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:40.979
 ah 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.670
 today 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.450
 let's go to each one of the clip 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.650
 now 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:57.969
 OK 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:02.129
 and we put it here 

00:06:57.969 --> 00:07:02.129
 we put the stick here 

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:10.259
 and then stretch this clip down 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.600
 but low 

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:20.790
 and as you can see it has shot well 

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:25.260
