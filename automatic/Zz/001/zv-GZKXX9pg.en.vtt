00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 in a good mood with the start number six 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.899
 but with the three churchyards here 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.309
 in third place from the first round 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.870
 comes back again 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.969
 kia, however, I have now, for now 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.750
 a place moved forward 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:19.230
 jason kremer change to volume caspari 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.539
 mr drive is then in the there 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.430
 a bit contrary to that 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.019
 has a shorthand then between the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.800
 two mÃ¼cke motorsport pilots were asked 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.480
 Kramer as fourth the 45 and caspari in 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.410
 the sixth position during Gustav 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.270
 Mahler is still familiar with rank 7 of the time 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.220
 the car of nicholas colas becomes the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.010
 Tug comes brings 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.280
 are now in these 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.210
 the location and there is one 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.559
 they go in twice are there 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.019
 pilots in the stretch 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.910
 Secured vehicle drove that nicolas 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.430
 coke getting down there 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.870
 should for heaven's sake and there is 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.149
 a red flag that I thought 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.420
 quite clearly that gives the red flag without 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.180
 if and but now it's only once 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.090
 take a deep breath 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.610
 there was yellow on the outside though 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.820
 on the way and over and over again 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.580
 it on the part of all security arrangements 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.000
 and driver reviews said it is 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.679
 at least once recognizable that the first 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.600
 the car of the line safety 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:26.610
 hit black out of the car 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.080
 Of course, the pain is clearly the result of the pain 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.590
 will have cheated mightily 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.179
 down there the second in the league at the moment 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.140
 is not yet recognizable 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:39.840
 at least responsive, yes, too 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.909
 from the car spend alexander 47's 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.330
 the second one has been in course of course 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.340
 even with a pain no question so 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.030
 Bright spot travels under normal 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.159
 circumstances reduce speed 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.350
 crossed yellow means beware 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.020
 the track may also be one 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.049
 locked transit a locked 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.780
 line there should be extremely the 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.539
 reduce speed and should 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.739
 Be careful and here you have it 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:13.040
 but on the part of the driver exactly 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.600
 this part a bit 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.570
 I misinterpret that way I want it 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.630
 say that was no longer a learning effect 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.579
 That's what the boys should all do 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.820
 in advance more than ample 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:28.890
 know that at such a place 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.320
 which is then crossed yellow in the 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.130
 flags in any case more than highest 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:40.500
 caution is required and we see 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.060
 behind gustav mallya the one who is there 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.430
 in the vehicle in the stretch 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.070
 backup vehicle first 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.660
 slipped into it is then 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.549
 Florian Herzog had been with the 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.590
 start number 9 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.510
 because we are missing there too, but it is 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.909
 as I said at least in times will be 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.440
 to give as far as that 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.819
 the pilots all from the first 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.280
 Vehicles are out as I said 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.810
 they will have grief 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.080
 there is one or the other something 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:11.150
 there is probably no second though 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.150
 opinion about it and
