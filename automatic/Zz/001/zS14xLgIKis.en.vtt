00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
so yeah we got full sand see a little

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.060 
so yeah we got full sand see a little
bit<00:00:49.070> of<00:00:49.160> gameplay<00:00:50.470> absolutely<00:00:51.470> Burlingame

bit of gameplay absolutely Burlingame
sort<00:00:52.400> of<00:00:52.460> like<00:00:52.550> g-locked<00:00:52.970> but<00:00:53.270> far<00:00:54.170> better

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
sort of like g-locked but far better

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.100 
sort of like g-locked but far better
graphics<00:00:54.860> and<00:00:55.660> the<00:00:56.660> buttons<00:00:56.930> are<00:00:57.020> working

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
graphics and the buttons are working

fine

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:28.360 

I<00:01:22.040> just<00:01:22.970> stuck<00:01:23.210> that<00:01:23.390> for<00:01:23.570> now<00:01:23.690> so<00:01:24.080> I<00:01:27.220> had<00:01:28.220> to

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
I just stuck that for now so I had to

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.970 
I just stuck that for now so I had to
cheat<00:01:28.610> a<00:01:28.670> little<00:01:28.850> bit<00:01:29.150> and<00:01:29.720> buy<00:01:30.380> another<00:01:30.560> atari

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
cheat a little bit and buy another atari

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:37.930 
cheat a little bit and buy another atari
lynx<00:01:31.070> -<00:01:31.460> because<00:01:32.470> this<00:01:33.470> was<00:01:33.710> actually<00:01:36.940> proving

lynx - because this was actually proving

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.610 
lynx - because this was actually proving
very<00:01:38.240> hard<00:01:38.540> for<00:01:38.780> me<00:01:38.900> to<00:01:38.990> fix<00:01:39.260> i<00:01:40.690> had<00:01:41.690> no<00:01:42.320> sound

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
very hard for me to fix i had no sound

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.070 
very hard for me to fix i had no sound
and<00:01:43.150> the<00:01:44.150> button<00:01:44.390> was<00:01:44.510> continuously

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
and the button was continuously

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.430 
and the button was continuously
functioning<00:01:45.740> i<00:01:45.890> took<00:01:46.280> it<00:01:46.400> apart<00:01:47.320> cleaned<00:01:48.320> it

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
functioning i took it apart cleaned it

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.680 
functioning i took it apart cleaned it
and<00:01:48.500> just<00:01:48.770> couldn't<00:01:49.270> couldn't<00:01:50.270> get<00:01:50.450> a<00:01:50.480> bunch

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
and just couldn't couldn't get a bunch

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.540 
and just couldn't couldn't get a bunch
to<00:01:50.900> functions<00:01:51.350> I<00:01:51.470> bought<00:01:51.650> another<00:01:51.890> tire<00:01:52.250> Lynx

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
to functions I bought another tire Lynx

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.950 
to functions I bought another tire Lynx
which<00:01:53.360> has<00:01:53.540> got<00:01:53.720> our<00:01:53.930> screen<00:01:54.410> problems<00:01:55.960> which

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
which has got our screen problems which

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.140 
which has got our screen problems which
I'll<00:01:57.230> show<00:01:57.560> you<00:01:57.590> now<00:01:57.920> before<00:01:58.580> a<00:01:58.610> cartridge<00:01:58.940> in

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
I'll show you now before a cartridge in

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.510 
I'll show you now before a cartridge in
it

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
it

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.260 
it
it's<00:02:01.520> got<00:02:03.040> lines<00:02:04.040> across<00:02:04.400> the<00:02:04.580> screen<00:02:04.820> so<00:02:05.180> I'll

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
it's got lines across the screen so I'll

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.160 
it's got lines across the screen so I'll
probably<00:02:05.450> just<00:02:05.630> keep<00:02:05.810> this<00:02:06.140> for<00:02:07.480> spares<00:02:08.480> we

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
probably just keep this for spares we

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.170 
probably just keep this for spares we
turn<00:02:09.380> this<00:02:09.500> one<00:02:09.710> on<00:02:10.120> see<00:02:11.120> that's<00:02:11.300> what<00:02:11.390> you<00:02:11.420> get

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
turn this one on see that's what you get

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:22.540 
turn this one on see that's what you get
so<00:02:14.410> what<00:02:15.410> I<00:02:15.440> wound<00:02:15.770> up<00:02:15.920> doing<00:02:17.740> was<00:02:21.100> so<00:02:22.100> swapping

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
so what I wound up doing was so swapping

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.600 
so what I wound up doing was so swapping
over<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.900> screens<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.500> board's<00:02:24.860> in

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
over the the screens and the board's in

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.980 
over the the screens and the board's in
flow<00:02:25.850> worked<00:02:26.060> out<00:02:26.240> the<00:02:26.390> screen<00:02:26.690> fault

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
flow worked out the screen fault

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.660 
flow worked out the screen fault
actualizing<00:02:27.530> this<00:02:27.770> front<00:02:28.040> section<00:02:28.280> which

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
actualizing this front section which

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.820 
actualizing this front section which
contains<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.270> speaker<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:29.900> knee<00:02:30.110> on<00:02:30.709> the

contains the speaker and knee on the

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.360 
contains the speaker and knee on the
buttons<00:02:31.160> which<00:02:31.700> you<00:02:33.190> disconnect<00:02:34.190> from<00:02:34.220> the

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
buttons which you disconnect from the

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.840 
buttons which you disconnect from the
board<00:02:34.610> by<00:02:34.790> two<00:02:34.850> ribbon<00:02:35.420> cables<00:02:36.430> so<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.580> screen

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
board by two ribbon cables so the screen

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.100 
board by two ribbon cables so the screen
fault<00:02:38.090> if<00:02:38.270> you've<00:02:38.420> got<00:02:38.570> internal<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:39.050> the

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
fault if you've got internal to the

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.229 
fault if you've got internal to the

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
screen screen fault the fault will lie

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.030 
screen screen fault the fault will lie
with<00:02:41.570> the<00:02:41.720> front<00:02:42.020> section<00:02:42.230> not<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.650> actual

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
with the front section not the actual

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.030 
with the front section not the actual
circuit<00:02:43.459> board<00:02:43.700> so<00:02:44.140> I<00:02:45.489> took<00:02:47.050> my<00:02:48.050> good<00:02:48.380> screen

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
circuit board so I took my good screen

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.910 
circuit board so I took my good screen
and<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:50.630> circuit<00:02:50.989> board<00:02:51.200> from<00:02:51.380> this<00:02:51.590> links

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
and the circuit board from this links

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.330 
and the circuit board from this links
with<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.400> bad<00:02:53.360> screen<00:02:53.780> put<00:02:54.739> Minister<00:02:55.070> and<00:02:55.280> it

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
with the bad screen put Minister and it

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.170 
with the bad screen put Minister and it
works<00:02:55.520> fine<00:02:58.150> but

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.050 

the<00:03:01.780> weird<00:03:02.019> thing<00:03:02.110> is<00:03:02.409> that<00:03:02.440> now<00:03:02.920> remember<00:03:03.879> my

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
the weird thing is that now remember my

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.979 
the weird thing is that now remember my
links<00:03:04.390> had<00:03:04.569> no<00:03:04.780> sound<00:03:06.480> when<00:03:07.480> I've<00:03:07.599> gone<00:03:07.780> and

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
links had no sound when I've gone and

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.770 
links had no sound when I've gone and
put<00:03:10.920> them<00:03:11.920> both<00:03:12.099> back<00:03:12.310> together<00:03:12.569> they<00:03:13.569> both

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
put them both back together they both

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.259 
put them both back together they both
got<00:03:13.989> sound<00:03:14.319> so<00:03:14.590> you<00:03:15.489> just<00:03:15.700> sort<00:03:15.879> of<00:03:15.909> fiddling

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
got sound so you just sort of fiddling

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.729 
got sound so you just sort of fiddling
about<00:03:16.390> with<00:03:16.540> them<00:03:16.810> swapping<00:03:17.260> all<00:03:17.379> over<00:03:17.709> I

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
about with them swapping all over I

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.319 
about with them swapping all over I
fixed<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.250> sound<00:03:18.549> but<00:03:18.819> the<00:03:18.909> buttons<00:03:19.180> are

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
fixed the sound but the buttons are

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.050 
fixed the sound but the buttons are
still<00:03:19.540> a<00:03:19.750> still<00:03:20.739> knackered<00:03:21.129> now<00:03:21.280> on<00:03:21.610> this<00:03:21.819> one

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
still a still knackered now on this one

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.030 
still a still knackered now on this one
and<00:03:22.659> it's<00:03:22.870> also<00:03:23.019> got<00:03:23.230> that<00:03:23.319> additional<00:03:23.769> screen

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
and it's also got that additional screen

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.430 
and it's also got that additional screen
fold<00:03:24.340> so<00:03:24.610> this<00:03:25.390> one<00:03:25.569> is<00:03:25.690> completely<00:03:26.140> knackered

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
fold so this one is completely knackered
