00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
that I all you think it's not that I go

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.040

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
for more personality or anything I just

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.840 
for more personality or anything I just
think<00:05:57.410> there's<00:05:57.740> an<00:05:57.860> Irish<00:05:58.130> charm<00:05:58.520> and

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.150 
think there's an Irish charm and
Irishmen<00:05:59.419> have<00:05:59.600> that<00:05:59.780> charm<00:06:00.080> and<00:06:00.320> I<00:06:00.530> think
