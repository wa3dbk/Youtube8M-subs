00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.780
 well I started at 10 years old 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:18.030
 with my parents that I started at school 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:20.520
 and I started from front design because in 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.400
 the teams had had only fit 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.950
 of a doorman and when I got there there was 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.670
 before starting the world me 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.290
 despaired 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.750
 I believe that 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.750
 [Music] 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.840
 I feel that 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.860
 if I felt ready and prepared to 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.180
 do a good job 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.210
 [Music] 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:50.329
 the matches were in good shape 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:54.050
 for me I knew the pressure that he 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.170
 I had because I had already had 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.620
 classical 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.570
 [Music] 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.750
 I was small I did not have options 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.900
 they were hard to play I knew it from 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.900
 beforehand 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.790
 and now in South Africa I had the 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.960
 eliminatory I was close to being there and 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.540
 at the last moment the coach 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.540
 change is a world reference 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.390
 in front of the quality the bet and always 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.090
 and good in spite of what happened now in 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.830
 the world Cup 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.100
 Of course it does not stain anything 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.500
 and his whole career 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.310
 also this summer 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.310
 It has been summer 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.659
 but a summer where many people talk 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.080
 goalkeepers where the World Cup was revalued 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.870
 the prediction 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.760
 this interview that the newspaper 'as' has 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.430
 made to Guillermo ochoa talking about 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.080
 summer that he lived from they asked him that 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.910
 What did Iker Casillas say? 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.220
 Give me a lot is a great archer if he had 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.930
 errors but it will not stop being one of the 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.850
 great icons of the goal and I think that 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.740
 I agree the world beyond 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.230
 how spectacular it was in terms of 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.340
 goals in terms of players I think 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.960
 that the goalkeepers had great 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.270
 relevance in this world cup I say 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.550
 not in vain today is already spoken of keylor 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.530
 navas that can go to real madrid 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.210
 we will see where will Guillermo arrive 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.180
 Eight that is the big unknown, not because 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.800
 the weeks pass the days and I 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.530
 many still without equipment is the great 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.480
 problem that would worry more than 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.790
 iker boxes is good or bad or 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.740
 will have to worry more about where they are going to 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.060
 to stop guillermo ochoa non is not for 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.390
 We not for the national team 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.430
 what's going to happen to him I do not know where 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.500
 they will take you to where your 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.120
 representative to take him he follows 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.790
 working obviously not he follows 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.070
 preparing physically but never 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.860
 it will be the same to be in a gym that 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.840
 and to work with a team and it knows nothing 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.950
 plus a photo the working in two 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.590
 bikes 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:59.540
 physical just not really living there's no 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.730
 better way to love to stay that 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.950
 obviously you already know what ministers 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.739
 do for a physical job be alone 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.110
 or you are not alone that already the experience you 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.209
 he gives it today the subject seems to have been one 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.489
 of the moments or markets where 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.819
 most goalkeepers have been sold 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.920
 international and that change has not 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.569
 that was expected today was talked about 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.950
 great teams from france that are going to 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.410
 acquire today's large teams of 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.110
 France already have good goalkeeper 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.670
 of italy no longer have goalkeeper of Spain 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.670
 they already have their goalies are 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:37.569
 because after what he did that the 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:41.959
 navas in the eighth of claudio bravo 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:43.819
 look that pulls and loosen if the Madrid 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.190
 wants to pay the clause if they flip and 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.840
 they say or we take out there I want to take out 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.910
 diego lopez that's the big problem for 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.040
 keylor a guillermo already has a great 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.900
 advantage that I think that they have not 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.210
 known to exploit the people who are 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.430
 around him is a free player 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.900
 the teams do not have a clause 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.420
 they have nothing that makes it become 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.000
 Asian for some team also for 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.100
 Of course it's two 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.290
 internationally brightness and that in addition 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.300
 good is it can be a media 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.250
 figure the europe because the team that 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.350
 it comes well and it's going to stop perfect 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.810
 does not have any physical problem is not 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.450
 present in terms of conditions 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.330
 refers to each self yes I think it is 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.040
 lengthening a lot the time of already knowing 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.350
 what team is going for now I think that 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.120
 the situation would change if he had not 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.500
 been started in the World Cup if not 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.730
 would have appeared good there would we say 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.260
 wow, the anger is stronger 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.330
 for the representative for his own 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.250
 Eight years of wanting to find a team 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.200
 solid where it can be where it can be 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.460
 headline but today it seems to me that after 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.650
 of the performance that the cup of the 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.930
 world 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.919
 well practically like this you get to 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.780
 present it to the team that what is 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.009
 watching ends up being the world cup 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.039
 is that what ends you 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:58.810
 surprising if before the world 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:01.930
 ochoa was already accommodated in three 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.870
 teams and after the world its great 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.630
 world does not have a team where is the 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:11.110
 error now one understands missing 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:14.020
 time for good follow the teams 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.030
 moving the pieces but sorry but the 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.570
 teams are already some now nothing of 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.550
 play friendly in the usa 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:24.940
 for what we are seeing with equipment 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.410
 great europe I do not think that a memo 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.240
 will reach you to reach a 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.280
 team of much renown in any 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.610
 of the leagues that you tell me in the 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.610
 world
