birth of now it's a color screen android
devices<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.510> 10<00:00:18.689> inch<00:00:18.810> version<00:00:19.050> told<00:00:19.500> there's

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
devices the 10 inch version told there's

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.310 
devices the 10 inch version told there's
a<00:00:19.770> 7<00:00:20.070> inch<00:00:20.130> version<00:00:20.369> in<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:21.420> offering<00:00:21.810> as<00:00:22.020> well

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
a 7 inch version in the offering as well

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.230 
a 7 inch version in the offering as well
but<00:00:22.500> quite<00:00:22.740> an<00:00:22.830> interesting<00:00:23.040> design<00:00:23.430> here<00:00:23.910> the

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
but quite an interesting design here the

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.330 
but quite an interesting design here the
weight<00:00:24.450> is<00:00:24.720> under<00:00:25.080> 700<00:00:25.740> grams<00:00:25.920> which<00:00:26.189> i<00:00:26.250> think

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
weight is under 700 grams which i think

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.130 
weight is under 700 grams which i think
is<00:00:26.460> important<00:00:26.970> for<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.210> 10<00:00:27.360> inch<00:00:27.509> device<00:00:27.689> and

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
is important for a 10 inch device and

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.080 
is important for a 10 inch device and
they've<00:00:28.680> actually<00:00:28.860> designed<00:00:29.430> it<00:00:29.610> with<00:00:29.730> with

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
they've actually designed it with with

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.580 
they've actually designed it with with
some<00:00:30.239> controls<00:00:30.689> on<00:00:30.899> the<00:00:31.050> bottom<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.410> let<00:00:31.529> me

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
some controls on the bottom and let me

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.620 
some controls on the bottom and let me
put<00:00:31.770> you<00:00:31.860> demonstrate<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.970> makes<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.390> actually

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
put you demonstrate it makes it actually

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.200 
put you demonstrate it makes it actually
very<00:00:33.930> very<00:00:34.079> easy<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.770> hold<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.310> portrait

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
very very easy to hold it in a portrait

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.210 
very very easy to hold it in a portrait
mode<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:37.050> screen<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.470> really<00:00:37.800> good<00:00:37.950> there's<00:00:38.160> a

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
mode the screen is really good there's a

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
good viewing angle there no problems

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.349 
good viewing angle there no problems
there<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.220> think<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.520> colors<00:00:41.880> are<00:00:41.969> pretty<00:00:42.090> good
