so<00:00:17.460> this<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:17.609> my<00:00:17.760> radio<00:00:18.210> spectrum<00:00:20.119> dx7<00:00:21.259> put<00:00:22.259> it

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
so this is my radio spectrum dx7 put it

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.519 
so this is my radio spectrum dx7 put it
on<00:00:23.480> now<00:00:24.480> it's<00:00:24.630> on<00:00:24.869> right<00:00:25.860> setup<00:00:26.820> for<00:00:27.529> still

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
on now it's on right setup for still

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.189 
on now it's on right setup for still
says<00:00:28.739> extra<00:00:29.189> 300<00:00:29.640> there<00:00:29.789> but<00:00:30.060> it's<00:00:30.900> actually

setup here battery same battery was in

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.400 
setup here battery same battery was in
the<00:00:37.710> plane<00:00:38.000> same<00:00:39.000> switch<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.110> was<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
the plane same switch that was in the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
to the AR 6200 which you can see anyway

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.119 
to the AR 6200 which you can see anyway
flip<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.859> on<00:00:56.870> syncs<00:00:57.870> up<00:00:57.960> happily<00:00:58.320> very<00:00:58.920> quickly

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
flip it on syncs up happily very quickly

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.860 
flip it on syncs up happily very quickly
I<00:00:59.399> haven't<00:01:00.030> hooked<00:01:00.120> up<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.449> throttle

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
I haven't hooked up to the throttle

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.360 
I haven't hooked up to the throttle
right<00:01:01.019> now<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:01.379> because<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.859> was<00:01:01.920> easy<00:01:02.309> to

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
right now just because it was easy to

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:10.790 
right now just because it was easy to

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
still has the bits of wood in it from

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.990 
still has the bits of wood in it from
the<00:01:57.650> plane<00:01:57.860> that<00:01:58.070> was<00:01:58.130> destroyed<00:01:58.550> around<00:01:58.820> it

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
the plane that was destroyed around it

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.260 
the plane that was destroyed around it
so<00:01:59.810> yes<00:02:00.080> it<00:02:00.460> suffered<00:02:01.460> a<00:02:01.550> severe<00:02:02.000> concussion

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270

this<00:02:05.480> is<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:06.230> elevator<00:02:06.770> servo<00:02:07.280> which<00:02:08.180> is<00:02:08.420> the

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
this is the elevator servo which is the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.780 
this is the elevator servo which is the
exact<00:02:08.990> control<00:02:09.410> input<00:02:09.740> that<00:02:09.920> I<00:02:10.100> completely

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
exact control input that I completely

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.520 
exact control input that I completely
lost<00:02:11.120> on<00:02:13.240> last<00:02:14.240> term<00:02:14.510> for<00:02:14.720> final<00:02:14.990> approach<00:02:15.200> so

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
lost on last term for final approach so

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:24.760 
lost on last term for final approach so
not<00:02:16.220> a<00:02:16.250> good<00:02:16.430> time<00:02:16.580> to<00:02:16.610> lose<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:19.900> so<00:02:21.760> burn
