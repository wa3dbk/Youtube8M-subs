fault of glass on hard so yes this

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.700 
fault of glass on hard so yes this
technique<00:00:15.089> does<00:00:15.360> work<00:00:15.599> on<00:00:15.809> hard<00:00:16.049> mode<00:00:16.139> as<00:00:16.470> well

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
technique does work on hard mode as well

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.590 
technique does work on hard mode as well
this<00:00:16.890> is<00:00:17.010> definitely<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.640> very<00:00:17.699> easy<00:00:18.300> technique

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
have a continuous area of effect you

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.130 
have a continuous area of effect you
just<00:01:07.439> throw<00:01:07.920> them<00:01:08.130> at<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.490> base<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.570> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140

Templar<00:01:10.680> basically<00:01:11.100> at<00:01:11.250> his<00:01:11.460> feet<00:01:11.790> now<00:01:12.090> he

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
Templar basically at his feet now he

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.539 
Templar basically at his feet now he
will<00:01:12.390> continue<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.810> back<00:01:13.350> up<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.979> eventually

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
will continue to back up and eventually

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.550 
will continue to back up and eventually
he's<00:01:14.970> simply<00:01:15.360> going<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.659> back<00:01:16.020> up<00:01:16.049> since<00:01:16.500> he

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
he's simply going to back up since he

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.840 
he's simply going to back up since he
spawns<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.040> middle<00:01:17.310> he<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:17.640> keeps

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
spawns in the middle he just keeps

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.910 
spawns in the middle he just keeps
backing<00:01:18.299> up<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.659> actually<00:01:19.409> goes<00:01:19.619> completely

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
backing up and actually goes completely

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.270 
backing up and actually goes completely
off<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.850> edge<00:01:21.030> if<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.900> keep<00:01:22.200> doing<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.619> now

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
off the edge if you keep doing this now

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.399 
off the edge if you keep doing this now
again<00:01:23.610> that's<00:01:23.790> really<00:01:24.299> all<00:01:24.540> there<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.990> this

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
again that's really all there is to this

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.620 
again that's really all there is to this
your<00:01:25.590> entire<00:01:25.860> team<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.310> here<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.700> would<00:01:27.390> suggest

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
your entire team is here I would suggest

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.420 
your entire team is here I would suggest
splitting<00:01:28.259> up<00:01:28.380> some<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.799> your<00:01:28.920> team<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
splitting up some of your team on the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.920 
splitting up some of your team on the
right<00:01:29.579> side<00:01:29.790> some<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.030> your<00:01:30.150> team<00:01:30.299> at<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.630> left

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
right side some of your team at the left

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.420 
right side some of your team at the left
side<00:01:31.079> like<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.409> see<00:01:31.560> us<00:01:31.680> doing<00:01:31.920> now<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.220> only

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
side like you see us doing now the only

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.660 
side like you see us doing now the only
reason<00:01:32.759> for<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.390> because<00:01:34.079> he<00:01:34.259> basically

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
reason for that is because he basically

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.980 
reason for that is because he basically
constitutes<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.970> it's<00:01:36.060> really<00:01:36.450> bad<00:01:36.630> if<00:01:36.840> your

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
constitutes and it's really bad if your

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.170 
constitutes and it's really bad if your
entire<00:01:37.259> team<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.890> same<00:01:38.100> side<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:38.700> by

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
entire team is on the same side so by
