00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.219 
was the same day it was the fifth that
we<00:03:14.609> checked<00:03:14.939> and<00:03:15.150> it<00:03:15.359> was<00:03:15.479> before<00:03:15.659> midnight

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:16.229

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:18.020 
we checked and it was before midnight
that<00:03:16.409> we<00:03:16.530> checked<00:03:16.769> because<00:03:17.010> obviously<00:03:17.310> this

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
that we checked because obviously this

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.180 
that we checked because obviously this
on<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.510> 6th<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:18.989> would<00:03:19.079> end<00:03:19.319> so<00:03:19.979> we're<00:03:20.099> like

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
on the 6th it would end so we're like

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.589
