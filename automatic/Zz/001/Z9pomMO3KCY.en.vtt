00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.219
 it's actually a bluetooth headset 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.139
 so that's just plain simple 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.000
 so as you will see on the 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.430
 video that will scroll on different 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.080
 photos she is really small 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.000
 compared to that I also had the 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.230
 samsung who was as little cheap she 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.650
 is really she's pretty much the 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.539
 same size 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.860
 we have several features so the 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.150
 button on off that allows him but 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.250
 you will see that will flash 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.140
 so we have the load button there that is 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.699
 damaged flashing and alongside a 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.230
 little light for the bluetooh the 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.320
 first time the bluetouff activate 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.940
 all alone and one can start behring 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.280
 the second time wanting to stay supported 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.110
 to start another what is good 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.370
 with this tower and there is that we 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.620
 can connect two devices 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.000
 simultaneously on on this headset 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.470
 it's a fantastic novel because you 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.510
 we can have a phone and a 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.460
 saw with apple we can pick up everything 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.170
 only all the benefits that are 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.079
 indicated on the box and which are 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.180
 real is the automatic adjustment 2 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.620
 meaning that is to say that in place 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.230
 silent the blood is going to be lower is 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.999
 in place for nothing the blood is going to be going 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.740
 to be increased we have other advantages 

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:08.990
 which are mentioned here the facility 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.130
 button use a clear sound 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.990
 and up to 6 hours 6 hours of 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.380
 communication with this headset 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.560
 bluetooth 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.569
 we had the microphone the button to call 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.950
 and to hang the button on off like 

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:24.920
 I told you and the volume button that 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.880
 are six on the side so you go 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.139
 see that they were photo that have to 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.119
 scroll or videos 

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:31.759
 behind me so I will continue to say 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.590
 if you do not like it of course then we have 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.420
 also a small accessory that is here 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.700
 which allows to fix the headset on 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.950
 the ear so there for example right side 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.749
 simply allies we can 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.729
 turn up all the drawing while 

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:46.189
 down no problem and we can also 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.259
 just take off that little clip what is 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.789
 here is to turn in order to be able to 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.799
 use it on the other ear so 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.880
 so that's it you know if you 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.829
 are already used ears rather 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.479
 that's so otherwise they become very 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:59.779
 easily the ear so she is not 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.279
 embarrassing at all then I will try 

00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:02.180
 to do it like on the ear of 

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:04.100
 samsung com 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.170
 I had already tested we could do it 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.149
 keep ring pursued so that's like 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.240
 you see that also holds very of course 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.760
 a judge just right like that without having 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.360
 need to use the part 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.040
 additional 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.660
 so we will do on the A3 and for you 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.550
 show that it works so that's it 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.320
 so it's something cool 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.120
 well it's not advisable to do it but 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.070
 it also holds thank you for having 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.140
