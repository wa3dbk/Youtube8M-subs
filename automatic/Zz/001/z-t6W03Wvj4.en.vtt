00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.330 
real interesting feel to it it's a super
solid<00:00:48.899> case<00:00:49.050> it's<00:00:49.260> not<00:00:49.410> at<00:00:49.559> all<00:00:49.649> flexible<00:00:49.890> so

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
solid case it's not at all flexible so

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.279 
solid case it's not at all flexible so
it's<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.520> very<00:00:50.550> rigid<00:00:50.940> case<00:00:51.300> then<00:00:51.960> here's<00:00:52.140> that

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
it's a very rigid case then here's that

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.930 
it's a very rigid case then here's that
removable<00:00:52.920> bottom<00:00:53.070> basically<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.910> comes

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
removable bottom basically it comes

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.119 
removable bottom basically it comes
apart<00:00:54.210> just<00:00:54.570> like<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.350> then<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.800> slide

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
apart just like that and then you slide

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.130 
apart just like that and then you slide
the<00:00:56.309> iphone<00:00:56.699> in<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.090> then<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:57.390> replaces

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the iphone in and then it just replaces

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.930 
the iphone in and then it just replaces
this<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.559> pretty<00:00:59.100> interesting<00:00:59.520> idea<00:00:59.730> haven't

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
you an idea what it looks like let's

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.399 
you an idea what it looks like let's
take<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.420> out<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.540> here<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.960> I'll<00:01:31.140> show<00:01:31.200> you

take it out of here and I'll show you

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.710 
take it out of here and I'll show you
how<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.650> whole<00:01:31.950> install<00:01:32.460> works<00:01:32.820> again<00:01:33.540> just

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
how the whole install works again just

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.600 
how the whole install works again just
remove<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.170> bottom<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.740> get<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.430> come

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
remove this bottom and get it to come

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.030 
remove this bottom and get it to come
down<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.840> there<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.170> go<00:01:37.200> slides<00:01:37.590> off<00:01:37.799> just

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
down and there you go slides off just

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.460 
down and there you go slides off just
like<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.850> let's<00:01:39.720> put<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.990> another<00:01:40.110> one

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
like so and let's put it another one

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.050 
like so and let's put it another one
here<00:01:40.650> let's<00:01:41.040> pick<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.310> blue<00:01:41.520> one<00:01:41.700> will<00:01:41.880> show

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
here let's pick the blue one will show

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.870 
here let's pick the blue one will show
you<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.390> blue<00:01:42.570> one<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.930> close<00:01:43.259> up<00:01:43.880> again

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
you the blue one is a close up again

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.179 
you the blue one is a close up again
just<00:01:45.030> remove<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.840> then<00:01:46.500> just<00:01:46.649> slide<00:01:46.979> the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
just remove this and then just slide the

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.410 
just remove this and then just slide the
phone<00:01:47.869> right<00:01:48.869> into<00:01:49.200> place<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:50.240> once<00:01:51.240> this

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
phone right into place and once this

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.190 
phone right into place and once this
gets<00:01:51.600> back<00:01:51.899> on<00:01:53.329> just<00:01:54.329> like<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.659> it's<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.020> nice

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
gets back on just like that it's a nice

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.080 
gets back on just like that it's a nice
secure<00:01:55.590> fit<00:01:55.649> alright<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.610> let's<00:01:56.759> take<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.909> look

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
secure fit alright so let's take a look

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.399 
secure fit alright so let's take a look
at<00:01:57.149> all<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.390> ports<00:01:57.630> controls<00:01:58.020> on<00:01:58.229> this

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
at all the ports controls on this

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.780 
at all the ports controls on this
alright<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.009> down<00:01:59.189> here<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.430> bottom<00:01:59.520> we

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
out here oval cut out for the volume up

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.930

and<00:02:19.590> down<00:02:19.710> no<00:02:20.280> problem<00:02:20.580> getting<00:02:20.640> in<00:02:20.820> there<00:02:20.910> I

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
and down no problem getting in there I

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.100 
and down no problem getting in there I
didn't<00:02:21.150> have<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.300> just<00:02:21.450> get<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.720> tip<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:21.930> my

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
didn't have to just get the tip of my

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.020 
didn't have to just get the tip of my
finger<00:02:22.440> in<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.710> little<00:02:22.950> bit<00:02:23.100> it<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.430> recessed<00:02:23.880> a

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
finger in a little bit it is recessed a

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.430 
finger in a little bit it is recessed a
little<00:02:24.270> bit<00:02:24.420> in<00:02:24.570> there<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:25.080> can<00:02:25.200> kind<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.380> see

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
little bit in there you can kind of see

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.290 
little bit in there you can kind of see
that's<00:02:26.310> good<00:02:26.490> to<00:02:26.550> give<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.730> good<00:02:26.910> protection

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
that's good to give a good protection

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.760 
that's good to give a good protection
but<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:27.810> is<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:27.960> little<00:02:28.110> bit<00:02:28.230> further<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.590> have

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
but it is a little bit further to have

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.070 
but it is a little bit further to have
to<00:02:28.830> get<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.010> with<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.190> tip<00:02:29.340> of<00:02:29.400> your<00:02:29.550> finger

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
to get it with the tip of your finger

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.750 
to get it with the tip of your finger
similarly<00:02:31.080> right<00:02:31.290> here<00:02:31.500> with<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:32.010> with<00:02:32.730> a

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
similarly right here with the with a

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.880 
similarly right here with the with a
silent<00:02:33.270> toggle<00:02:33.570> switch<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:34.230> is<00:02:34.350> recessed<00:02:34.710> up

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
silent toggle switch it is recessed up

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.590 
silent toggle switch it is recessed up
pretty<00:02:35.100> well<00:02:35.160> but<00:02:35.490> it's<00:02:35.730> not<00:02:35.880> too<00:02:36.150> bad<00:02:36.180> so<00:02:36.510> you

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
pretty well but it's not too bad so you

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.790 
pretty well but it's not too bad so you
can<00:02:36.720> kind<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:36.930> get<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.170> with<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.380> tip<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:37.590> your

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
can kind of get it with the tip of your

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.430 
can kind of get it with the tip of your
finger<00:02:38.340> up<00:02:38.520> top<00:02:39.180> here<00:02:39.210> is<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.840> headset<00:02:40.200> jack

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
finger up top here is the headset jack

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.530 
finger up top here is the headset jack
it's<00:02:41.100> pretty<00:02:41.280> good<00:02:41.490> size<00:02:41.700> cutout<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.360> I<00:02:42.390> just

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
it's pretty good size cutout and I just

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.420 
it's pretty good size cutout and I just
have<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:42.810> little<00:02:43.050> I'm<00:02:43.290> kind<00:02:43.320> of<00:02:43.650> oversight

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
have this little I'm kind of oversight

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.420 
have this little I'm kind of oversight
here<00:02:44.730> for<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.540> top<00:02:45.900> microphone<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.890> so<00:02:47.340> you

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
here for the top microphone and so you

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.590 
here for the top microphone and so you
should<00:02:47.520> be<00:02:47.610> pretty<00:02:47.790> good<00:02:47.880> with<00:02:48.000> most<00:02:48.209> most

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
should be pretty good with most most

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.690 
should be pretty good with most most
headsets<00:02:49.020> that<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.230> test<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:49.709> wasn't<00:02:50.400> I'm<00:02:50.580> you

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
headsets that I test it wasn't I'm you

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.190 
headsets that I test it wasn't I'm you
know<00:02:50.760> really<00:02:50.880> too<00:02:51.120> much<00:02:51.150> of<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.420> problem<00:02:51.570> then

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
know really too much of a problem then

know really too much of a problem then
here<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:53.220> power<00:02:53.489> button<00:02:53.760> up<00:02:54.060> top<00:02:54.090> here<00:02:54.330> no

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
here is the power button up top here no

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.000 
here is the power button up top here no
problem<00:02:54.989> with<00:02:55.080> that<00:02:55.140> it<00:02:55.410> does<00:02:55.560> have<00:02:55.680> this<00:02:55.830> nice

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
problem with that it does have this nice

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.760 
problem with that it does have this nice
little<00:02:56.160> cut<00:02:56.459> down<00:02:57.350> you<00:02:58.350> see<00:02:58.500> if<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.590> can<00:02:58.680> give

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
little cut down you see if I can give

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.260 
little cut down you see if I can give
you<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:58.890> shot<00:02:59.070> of<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.850> know<00:02:59.910> see<00:03:00.090> right

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
you a shot of that you know see right

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.460 
you a shot of that you know see right
here<00:03:00.420> it's<00:03:00.540> kind<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:00.720> cut<00:03:00.900> down<00:03:01.050> a<00:03:01.080> little<00:03:01.320> bit

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
here it's kind of cut down a little bit

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.870 
here it's kind of cut down a little bit
this<00:03:01.620> is<00:03:01.680> nice<00:03:01.920> so<00:03:02.160> that<00:03:02.310> when<00:03:02.459> you're<00:03:02.610> holding

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
this is nice so that when you're holding

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.940 
this is nice so that when you're holding
it<00:03:02.970> like<00:03:03.090> this<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:03.840> you<00:03:03.959> go<00:03:03.989> to<00:03:04.110> press<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:04.560> you

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
it like this and you go to press it you

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.650 
it like this and you go to press it you
don't<00:03:05.100> have<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.280> push<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:05.940> know<00:03:06.030> so<00:03:06.209> far<00:03:06.420> in

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
don't have to push you know so far in

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.030 
don't have to push you know so far in
with<00:03:06.900> your<00:03:07.080> finger<00:03:07.380> that's<00:03:07.560> a<00:03:07.680> nice<00:03:07.830> touch

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
with your finger that's a nice touch

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.650 
with your finger that's a nice touch
right<00:03:08.100> there<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:09.000> on<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.180> back<00:03:09.300> here<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.540> can

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
right there so on the back here you can

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.570 
right there so on the back here you can
see<00:03:09.810> it's<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:09.989> solid<00:03:10.260> color<00:03:10.709> on<00:03:11.010> this<00:03:11.190> does<00:03:11.400> have

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
see it's a solid color on this does have

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.180 
see it's a solid color on this does have
a<00:03:11.610> nice<00:03:11.850> kind<00:03:12.450> of<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.630> mat<00:03:12.900> feel<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.530> it<00:03:13.560> I'm<00:03:14.040> not

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
a nice kind of a mat feel to it I'm not

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.710 
a nice kind of a mat feel to it I'm not
really<00:03:14.580> marshmallow<00:03:15.209> but<00:03:15.360> it<00:03:15.420> does<00:03:15.510> have<00:03:15.690> a

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
really marshmallow but it does have a

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.900 
really marshmallow but it does have a
nice<00:03:15.870> soft<00:03:16.200> texture<00:03:16.709> to<00:03:16.920> it<00:03:16.950> then<00:03:17.520> here<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:17.880> a

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
nice soft texture to it then here is a

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.300 
nice soft texture to it then here is a
cutout<00:03:18.209> for<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.660> camera<00:03:19.320> and<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.590> LED<00:03:19.920> flash

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
cutout for the camera and the LED flash

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.370 
cutout for the camera and the LED flash
I<00:03:20.640> did<00:03:21.000> have<00:03:21.120> some<00:03:21.269> problems<00:03:21.299> with<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:22.080> flash

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
I did have some problems with the flash

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.039 
I did have some problems with the flash
reflecting<00:03:22.650> back<00:03:23.310> into<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.480> camera<00:03:24.870> you

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
reflecting back into the the camera you

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.229 
reflecting back into the the camera you
know<00:03:25.140> what<00:03:25.260> I<00:03:25.290> use<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.680> flash<00:03:25.920> on<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:27.030> lighter

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
know what I use the flash on the lighter

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.789 
know what I use the flash on the lighter
ones<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.780> was<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.049> worst<00:03:28.200> this<00:03:28.440> one<00:03:28.590> here<00:03:28.769> was

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
ones it was the worst this one here was

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.410 
ones it was the worst this one here was
pretty<00:03:29.100> bad<00:03:29.280> but<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.519> black<00:03:29.700> actually<00:03:30.000> seemed

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
pretty bad but the black actually seemed

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.449 
pretty bad but the black actually seemed
pretty<00:03:30.570> good<00:03:30.840> but<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.650> lighter<00:03:31.860> colors<00:03:32.220> seem

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
pretty good but the lighter colors seem

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.850 
pretty good but the lighter colors seem
to<00:03:32.580> reflect<00:03:32.910> back<00:03:33.269> into<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.870> case<00:03:34.170> and<00:03:34.410> my

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
to reflect back into the case and my

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.170 
to reflect back into the case and my
trick<00:03:35.130> for<00:03:35.280> this<00:03:35.430> is<00:03:35.580> just<00:03:35.730> basically<00:03:35.940> take<00:03:36.150> a

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
trick for this is just basically take a

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.750 
trick for this is just basically take a
sharpie<00:03:36.570> marker<00:03:36.959> and<00:03:37.140> color<00:03:37.530> in<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:38.100> inside

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
sharpie marker and color in the inside

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.000 
sharpie marker and color in the inside
of<00:03:39.120> this<00:03:39.480> cutout<00:03:39.750> right<00:03:39.870> here<00:03:40.200> and<00:03:40.350> that<00:03:40.739> seems

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
of this cutout right here and that seems

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.130 
of this cutout right here and that seems
to<00:03:41.100> cut<00:03:41.340> down<00:03:41.519> on<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.940> reflection<00:03:42.480> back<00:03:42.690> into

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
to cut down on the reflection back into

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.110 
to cut down on the reflection back into
it<00:03:43.260> so<00:03:43.470> just<00:03:43.680> know<00:03:44.130> you<00:03:44.700> know<00:03:44.760> there<00:03:44.880> are<00:03:44.910> some

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
it so just know you know there are some

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.240 
it so just know you know there are some
potential<00:03:45.420> issues<00:03:45.870> here<00:03:46.080> for<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.590> flash<00:03:46.890> on

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
potential issues here for the flash on

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.310 
potential issues here for the flash on
this<00:03:47.580> on<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:48.269> front<00:03:48.390> year<00:03:48.630> it<00:03:48.810> comes<00:03:49.019> up<00:03:49.170> over

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
this on the front year it comes up over

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.320 
this on the front year it comes up over
the<00:03:49.590> edge<00:03:49.739> of<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.190> case<00:03:50.400> pretty<00:03:50.760> well<00:03:50.970> you<00:03:51.209> can

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
the edge of the case pretty well you can

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.699 
the edge of the case pretty well you can
see<00:03:51.510> I<00:03:51.540> do<00:03:51.660> have<00:03:51.840> a<00:03:51.870> screen<00:03:52.080> protector<00:03:52.200> on<00:03:52.560> here

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
see I do have a screen protector on here

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.199 
see I do have a screen protector on here
does<00:03:52.890> not<00:03:52.920> bubble<00:03:53.250> up<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:53.610> screen<00:03:53.790> protector

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
does not bubble up the screen protector

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.000 
does not bubble up the screen protector
which<00:03:54.390> I<00:03:54.600> was<00:03:54.840> really<00:03:54.959> wondering<00:03:55.200> because<00:03:55.500> it

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
which I was really wondering because it

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.490 
which I was really wondering because it
is<00:03:56.160> a<00:03:56.190> really<00:03:56.430> tight<00:03:56.760> you<00:03:57.000> know<00:03:57.030> snug<00:03:57.360> fit<00:03:57.780> but

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
is a really tight you know snug fit but

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.140 
is a really tight you know snug fit but
it<00:03:58.590> does<00:03:58.709> have<00:03:58.890> a<00:03:58.920> nice<00:03:59.100> lip<00:03:59.549> on<00:03:59.760> it<00:03:59.790> so<00:04:00.090> when

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
it does have a nice lip on it so when

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.699 
it does have a nice lip on it so when
you<00:04:00.239> do<00:04:00.360> put<00:04:00.540> it<00:04:00.660> down<00:04:00.840> on<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:01.080> table<00:04:01.110> if<00:04:01.650> you

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
you do put it down on the table if you

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.110 
you do put it down on the table if you
have<00:04:01.799> any<00:04:01.920> grit<00:04:02.160> anything<00:04:02.489> on<00:04:02.610> the<00:04:02.790> screen<00:04:03.000> or

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
have any grit anything on the screen or

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.640 
have any grit anything on the screen or
on<00:04:03.360> the<00:04:03.480> table<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:03.900> it<00:04:04.019> kind<00:04:04.170> of<00:04:04.230> gets<00:04:04.320> bumped

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
on the table and it kind of gets bumped

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.810 
on the table and it kind of gets bumped
around<00:04:04.920> you<00:04:05.310> know<00:04:05.400> it's<00:04:05.489> not<00:04:05.580> gonna<00:04:05.730> be

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
around you know it's not gonna be

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.220 
around you know it's not gonna be
scratching<00:04:06.209> up<00:04:06.299> your<00:04:06.420> glass<00:04:06.600> that's<00:04:06.870> always<00:04:07.200> a

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
scratching up your glass that's always a

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.570 
scratching up your glass that's always a
nice<00:04:07.440> thing<00:04:07.500> alright<00:04:08.130> so<00:04:08.280> we'll<00:04:08.400> go<00:04:08.549> through

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
nice thing alright so we'll go through

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.860

power button in a little bit another way
is<00:05:10.820> you<00:05:11.240> can<00:05:11.360> just<00:05:11.479> basically<00:05:11.630> you<00:05:12.530> know<00:05:12.590> just

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
is you can just basically you know just

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.170 
is you can just basically you know just
kind<00:05:12.889> of<00:05:12.919> grip<00:05:13.099> it<00:05:13.220> like<00:05:13.340> this<00:05:13.490> one<00:05:13.789> to<00:05:13.910> get<00:05:14.030> up

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
kind of grip it like this one to get up

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.089 
kind of grip it like this one to get up
and<00:05:14.330> just<00:05:14.449> push<00:05:14.750> on<00:05:14.930> the<00:05:15.080> glass<00:05:15.349> and<00:05:15.860> that

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
and just push on the glass and that

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:17.920 
and just push on the glass and that
seems<00:05:16.340> to<00:05:16.400> get<00:05:16.580> it<00:05:16.699> off<00:05:16.820> and<00:05:17.030> overall<00:05:17.810> it<00:05:17.900> seems

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
seems to get it off and overall it seems

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.420 
seems to get it off and overall it seems
to<00:05:18.169> be<00:05:18.199> pretty<00:05:18.380> good<00:05:18.650> the<00:05:18.860> only<00:05:19.009> knock<00:05:19.190> on<00:05:19.370> I

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
to be pretty good the only knock on I

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.999 
to be pretty good the only knock on I
give<00:05:19.759> it<00:05:19.880> is<00:05:20.090> the<00:05:20.389> the<00:05:20.810> LED<00:05:21.410> flash<00:05:21.710> you<00:05:21.949> know

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:22.009 
give it is the the LED flash you know

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.129 
give it is the the LED flash you know
reflects<00:05:22.430> in<00:05:22.699> but<00:05:23.060> like<00:05:23.720> I<00:05:23.810> mentioned<00:05:23.960> you

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
reflects in but like I mentioned you

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:25.719 
reflects in but like I mentioned you
could<00:05:24.229> probably<00:05:24.380> color<00:05:24.650> that<00:05:24.860> in<00:05:25.099> and<00:05:25.400> take

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
could probably color that in and take

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:27.159 
could probably color that in and take
care<00:05:25.880> of<00:05:25.940> some<00:05:26.030> of<00:05:26.270> that<00:05:26.419> so<00:05:26.660> there<00:05:27.080> you<00:05:27.139> go

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169
