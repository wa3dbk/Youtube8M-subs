get your hand on these are the one-pound
boxes<00:00:25.199> they<00:00:26.070> close<00:00:26.250> about<00:00:26.400> sixty<00:00:26.760> cents<00:00:27.000> each

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
boxes they close about sixty cents each

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.140 
boxes they close about sixty cents each
and<00:00:28.050> for<00:00:28.439> this<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:29.010> make<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.189> gallon<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.670> solution

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
and for this to make a gallon a solution

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.939 
and for this to make a gallon a solution
you'll<00:00:30.359> need<00:00:30.539> roughly<00:00:30.900> two<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.289> these<00:00:31.380> boxes

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
you'll need roughly two of these boxes

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.770 
you'll need roughly two of these boxes
the<00:00:32.579> first<00:00:32.850> thing<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.120> want<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.360> do<00:00:33.510> is

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
the first thing you want to do is

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.490 
the first thing you want to do is
pre-heat<00:00:34.530> your<00:00:34.739> oven<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:36.620> about<00:00:37.790> 350<00:00:38.790> degrees

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
pre-heat your oven to about 350 degrees

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.880 
pre-heat your oven to about 350 degrees
so<00:00:40.500> Nikora<00:00:40.950> cups<00:00:41.660> baking<00:00:42.660> soda<00:00:42.930> we<00:00:43.620> got<00:00:43.770> our

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
so Nikora cups baking soda we got our

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.650 
so Nikora cups baking soda we got our
two<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.219> quarter<00:00:44.460> cups<00:00:44.700> spread<00:00:45.120> out<00:00:45.270> evenly

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
two and quarter cups spread out evenly

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.340 
two and quarter cups spread out evenly
in<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.840> pan

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
in the pan

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.049 
in the pan
and<00:00:46.920> I'm<00:00:47.010> just<00:00:47.160> going<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.340> place<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.789> oven

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
and I'm just going to place in the oven

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.350 
and I'm just going to place in the oven
for<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> roughly<00:00:49.079> an<00:00:49.170> hour<00:00:50.030> you<00:00:51.030> don't<00:00:51.090> have<00:00:51.239> to

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
for a roughly an hour you don't have to

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.450 
for a roughly an hour you don't have to
worry<00:00:51.620> you<00:00:52.620> know<00:00:52.739> if<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:52.980> leave<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:53.340> there

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
worry you know if you leave it in there

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.069 
worry you know if you leave it in there
for<00:00:53.489> longer<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.239> really<00:00:54.510> not<00:00:54.690> gonna<00:00:54.899> make<00:00:55.020> a

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
for longer it really not gonna make a

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.520 
for longer it really not gonna make a
difference

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
difference

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.010 
difference
and<00:00:56.210> even<00:00:57.210> if<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.420> set<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> higher

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
and even if you set it to a higher

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.279 
and even if you set it to a higher
temperature<00:00:58.410> even<00:00:58.859> if<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.129> 400<00:00:59.789> degrees

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
temperature even if it's 400 degrees

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.799 
temperature even if it's 400 degrees
it's<00:01:01.289> better<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.770> go<00:01:01.890> longer<00:01:02.160> than<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:03.390> go

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
it's better to go longer than to go

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.850 
it's better to go longer than to go
shorter<00:01:04.199> with<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:06.409> so<00:01:07.409> I've<00:01:07.530> taken<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
shorter with this so I've taken the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.219 
shorter with this so I've taken the
baking<00:01:08.460> soda<00:01:08.640> out<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.030> oven<00:01:09.180> it's<00:01:09.960> been<00:01:10.110> in

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
baking soda out of the oven it's been in

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.260 
baking soda out of the oven it's been in
there<00:01:10.470> for<00:01:11.130> about<00:01:11.220> an<00:01:11.400> hour<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.760> ten<00:01:11.939> minutes

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
there for about an hour and ten minutes

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.399 
there for about an hour and ten minutes
I<00:01:12.479> had<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.810> at<00:01:12.960> 350<00:01:13.650> degrees<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:15.990> have<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> one

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
I had it at 350 degrees and I have a one

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.510 
I had it at 350 degrees and I have a one
gallon<00:01:16.710> container<00:01:16.740> here<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.580> filled<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:19.340> up<00:01:20.340> to

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
gallon container here I filled it up to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.640 
gallon container here I filled it up to
about<00:01:20.790> here<00:01:21.110> with<00:01:22.110> ro/di<00:01:22.619> water<00:01:24.439> so<00:01:25.439> now<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
about here with ro/di water so now the

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.929 
about here with ro/di water so now the
next<00:01:25.860> step<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.540> I<00:01:27.540> have<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.689> regular<00:01:28.579> large<00:01:29.579> pot

ro/di<00:02:13.519> water<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:14.180> I<00:02:14.870> started<00:02:15.290> trying<00:02:15.799> to

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
ro/di water and I started trying to

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.420 
ro/di water and I started trying to
slowly<00:02:16.310> add<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:17.120> baked<00:02:17.690> baking<00:02:18.110> soda<00:02:18.400> what<00:02:19.400> I

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
slowly add the baked baking soda what I

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.559 
slowly add the baked baking soda what I
ended<00:02:19.730> up<00:02:19.849> with<00:02:20.090> was<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.420> huge<00:02:20.930> clump<00:02:21.470> of<00:02:22.569> baking

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
ended up with was a huge clump of baking

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.170 
ended up with was a huge clump of baking
soda<00:02:23.810> inside<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.620> gallon<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.250> it<00:02:25.790> was<00:02:25.910> really

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
soda inside the gallon and it was really

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.250 
soda inside the gallon and it was really
a<00:02:26.209> pain<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:26.780> break<00:02:27.110> apart<00:02:27.230> inside<00:02:27.799> there<00:02:29.260> so

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
a pain to break apart inside there so

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.750 
a pain to break apart inside there so
I'm<00:02:30.379> just<00:02:30.530> heating<00:02:30.890> this<00:02:31.160> up<00:02:31.340> I'm<00:02:31.430> gonna<00:02:31.549> let

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
I'm just heating this up I'm gonna let

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.339 
I'm just heating this up I'm gonna let
it<00:02:31.790> heat<00:02:32.030> up<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.239> little<00:02:32.420> bit<00:02:35.140> so<00:02:36.140> I'm<00:02:36.200> just

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
it heat up a little bit so I'm just

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:46.059 
it heat up a little bit so I'm just
gonna<00:02:36.530> slowly<00:02:36.890> start<00:02:42.250> adding<00:02:43.250> in<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:45.590> big

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
gonna slowly start adding in the big

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:55.640 
gonna slowly start adding in the big
baking<00:02:46.519> soda

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.020 

right

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:23.309 

so<00:03:01.600> we<00:03:01.690> got<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:01.990> all<00:03:02.050> in<00:03:02.110> there

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:36.010 

just<00:03:24.319> mix<00:03:24.590> it<00:03:24.770> up<00:03:24.830> a<00:03:24.980> bit<00:03:32.410> and<00:03:33.410> you'll<00:03:33.590> see<00:03:35.020> see

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
just mix it up a bit and you'll see see

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.840 
just mix it up a bit and you'll see see
this<00:03:36.170> is<00:03:36.350> a<00:03:36.380> electric<00:03:37.010> stove<00:03:37.220> so<00:03:37.430> it<00:03:37.550> takes<00:03:37.730> a

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
this is a electric stove so it takes a

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.059 
this is a electric stove so it takes a
little<00:03:37.970> bit<00:03:38.650> to<00:03:39.650> get<00:03:39.769> up<00:03:39.920> the<00:03:40.069> tent<00:03:41.890> right<00:03:42.890> now

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
little bit to get up the tent right now

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.660 
little bit to get up the tent right now
you<00:03:43.489> can<00:03:43.670> see<00:03:44.110> it's<00:03:45.110> been<00:03:45.290> clumping<00:03:45.739> inside

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
you can see it's been clumping inside

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.309 
you can see it's been clumping inside
here<00:03:46.970> this<00:03:47.330> waters<00:03:47.690> still<00:03:48.280> pretty<00:03:49.280> cold<00:03:50.319> so

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
here this waters still pretty cold so

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.789 
here this waters still pretty cold so
we're<00:03:51.470> going<00:03:51.560> to<00:03:51.650> continue<00:03:51.920> to<00:03:52.160> heat<00:03:52.340> this

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
we're going to continue to heat this

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.150 
we're going to continue to heat this
I'll<00:03:54.799> just<00:03:54.860> stir<00:03:55.250> it<00:03:55.280> every<00:03:55.640> once<00:03:55.819> in<00:03:55.940> a<00:03:56.030> while

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
I'll just stir it every once in a while

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.500 
I'll just stir it every once in a while
now<00:03:58.160> this<00:03:58.340> is<00:03:58.489> getting<00:03:58.610> clearer<00:03:59.030> and<00:03:59.060> clearer

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
now this is getting clearer and clearer

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.070 
now this is getting clearer and clearer
as<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.980> heat<00:04:01.280> is<00:04:01.519> helping<00:04:01.880> the<00:04:02.060> big<00:04:02.660> baking

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
as the heat is helping the big baking

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.039 
as the heat is helping the big baking
soda<00:04:03.319> dissolve<00:04:03.739> and<00:04:04.549> I<00:04:05.420> could<00:04:05.690> see<00:04:05.840> there's

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
soda dissolve and I could see there's

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.559 
soda dissolve and I could see there's
there's<00:04:06.920> a<00:04:07.069> few<00:04:07.340> small<00:04:07.519> clumps<00:04:08.060> in<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:08.239> bottom

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
there's a few small clumps in the bottom

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.259 
there's a few small clumps in the bottom
and<00:04:08.780> what<00:04:09.709> you<00:04:09.799> can<00:04:09.980> do<00:04:10.190> to<00:04:10.489> kind<00:04:10.790> of<00:04:10.880> speed<00:04:11.120> it

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
and what you can do to kind of speed it

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.270 
and what you can do to kind of speed it
up<00:04:11.390> a<00:04:11.540> little<00:04:11.660> bit<00:04:11.900> is<00:04:12.170> just<00:04:12.709> kind<00:04:12.950> of<00:04:13.069> crush

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
up a little bit is just kind of crush

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.309 
up a little bit is just kind of crush
them<00:04:13.430> with<00:04:13.549> your<00:04:13.730> spoon<00:04:14.000> that<00:04:14.840> will<00:04:14.959> help<00:04:15.080> them

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
them with your spoon that will help them

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.789 
them with your spoon that will help them
dissolve<00:04:16.090> it's<00:04:17.090> not<00:04:17.269> totally<00:04:17.570> necessary<00:04:17.799> if

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
dissolve it's not totally necessary if

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.229 
dissolve it's not totally necessary if
you<00:04:18.919> heat<00:04:19.100> it<00:04:19.130> up<00:04:19.280> enough<00:04:19.579> it's<00:04:19.850> all<00:04:19.970> going<00:04:20.180> to

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
you heat it up enough it's all going to

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.409 
you heat it up enough it's all going to
dissolve<00:04:20.539> anyway<00:04:21.760> you<00:04:22.760> don't<00:04:22.850> really<00:04:23.060> need<00:04:23.270> to

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
dissolve anyway you don't really need to

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.560 
dissolve anyway you don't really need to
get<00:04:23.539> this<00:04:23.720> to<00:04:23.900> boiling<00:04:24.910> but<00:04:25.910> you<00:04:26.180> just<00:04:26.300> want<00:04:26.510> to

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
get this to boiling but you just want to

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.380 
get this to boiling but you just want to
keep<00:04:26.750> heating<00:04:27.020> it<00:04:27.430> and<00:04:28.430> so<00:04:28.640> you<00:04:28.729> see<00:04:29.060> it's<00:04:29.210> all

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
keep heating it and so you see it's all

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:36.030 
keep heating it and so you see it's all
dissolved

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.900 

all<00:04:36.940> right<00:04:37.180> so<00:04:37.330> we're<00:04:37.480> fully<00:04:37.690> dissolved<00:04:38.910> and

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
all right so we're fully dissolved and

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.880 
all right so we're fully dissolved and
all<00:04:40.180> I'm<00:04:40.240> gonna<00:04:40.390> do<00:04:40.600> now<00:04:40.630> is<00:04:40.780> just<00:04:41.170> turn<00:04:41.560> off<00:04:41.770> to

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
all I'm gonna do now is just turn off to

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:47.370 
all I'm gonna do now is just turn off to
eat<00:04:42.420> let<00:04:43.420> this<00:04:43.600> cool<00:04:43.810> down<00:04:43.870> a<00:04:44.110> bit<00:04:46.230> and<00:04:47.230> we'll

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
eat let this cool down a bit and we'll

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.060 
eat let this cool down a bit and we'll
get<00:04:47.530> on<00:04:47.650> to<00:04:47.860> the<00:04:48.040> final<00:04:48.910> step<00:04:49.590> okay<00:04:50.590> so<00:04:50.680> we<00:04:50.890> let

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
get on to the final step okay so we let

00:04:51.070 --> 00:05:25.340 
get on to the final step okay so we let
our<00:04:51.190> solution<00:04:51.760> cool<00:04:52.000> down

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.720 

then<00:05:26.350> what<00:05:26.560> we're<00:05:26.710> gonna<00:05:26.770> do<00:05:27.040> is<00:05:27.220> just<00:05:27.400> fill

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
then what we're gonna do is just fill

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:36.810 
then what we're gonna do is just fill
the<00:05:27.940> remaining<00:05:28.510> amount<00:05:35.460> okay<00:05:36.460> there<00:05:36.670> you<00:05:36.700> have

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
the remaining amount okay there you have

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.700 
the remaining amount okay there you have
it<00:05:36.970> we<00:05:37.210> have<00:05:37.330> one<00:05:37.540> gallon<00:05:38.020> of<00:05:38.170> alkalinity

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
it we have one gallon of alkalinity

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.230 
it we have one gallon of alkalinity
solution<00:05:39.240> and<00:05:40.240> it<00:05:40.450> cost<00:05:40.660> me<00:05:40.750> about<00:05:40.930> a<00:05:41.080> buck<00:05:41.350> 20

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
solution and it cost me about a buck 20

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.830 
solution and it cost me about a buck 20
not<00:05:43.240> too<00:05:43.390> bad

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
not too bad
