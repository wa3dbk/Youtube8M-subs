00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:07.400
 I went to think our eighth 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:10.960
 and with the mentality that I'm going to 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:15.969
 learn in this exam for the next 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.969
 pass that mentality 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:22.429
 when you take 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.000
 almost halfway through the exam I was 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:25.000
 trusted 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.789
 and all do not change the half to 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.629
 back everything I'm going to catch 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:38.890
 only the other half affected me 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:42.500
 I decided not to go through the nerves 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.780
 in one hour two hours two hours and in 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.800
 how much more or less did you think that 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.100
 I was already wearing it 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.250
 may sound exaggerated but in 30 minutes 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.780
 and I had already asked almost 50 questions 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.370
 you know what 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:04.930
 because everyone calls I knew I focused 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:07.799
 both in learning and four years ago not 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.799
 I thought to use or not 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.850
 I did not know how to practically know things 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.020
 that I learned here in four of them 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.000
 practically 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.170
 he does not learn them in a year 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.170
 complete in school 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.500
 find a formula me when I left 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.290
 the school did not know me any way 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.090
 I even think it went pretty well 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.000
 d'esquadra with the powders 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:44.219
 here a negative drop and did not apply the 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.219
 a little more easily than it is 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:54.789
 by themes of what is written 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.799
 remember something and make himself 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.750
 repeat repetition really 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.750
 will remember the period of life 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:10.269
 had told me that the aim to empty 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.160
 to the mental map on a paper where they were 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.560
 all the formulas to be able to perform 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.620
 the exam and he told me he tells me 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.530
 minister you know that I did more than 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.640
 three times and when it comes to the moment of 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.640
 do the exam did not have 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:33.830
 I did that so everything that I 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.550
 blank 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.550
 as you want 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.689
 and the exam process had a lot 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.209
 a lot of pressure from the group of 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:50.519
 I work from there in terms of 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.859
 students like you felt and from 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.620
 feel comfortable or you felt a little 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:58.500
 intimidated by the presence he did not feel 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.709
 like that badly because those people from 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.709
 behind 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.689
 I thought that they believed that I 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:09.719
 I was copying during the one I was doing 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:13.499
 all those exercises and they had a plan 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:15.150
 of formula on a written paper and they 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:17.310
 behind me in question because I do not know 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.110
 I felt good even in the calculator 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.480
 two pieces were divided 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:26.620
 I was nervous about the person I 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.250
 he stopped behind me he watched me what I 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.400
 toward 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.840
 how he feels uncomfortable with that but that 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.350
 it was the only discomfort because in 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.350
 how much to the exam 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.930
 that gave me time to finish it back to 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.380
 review the complete one by one each 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.380
 of the questions 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.569
 and he left I went practically out of 20 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.930
 minutes before the end of the 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.930
 state 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:04:01.319
 the average time just because I can 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:05.510
 have finished I am sure that what 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:08.959
 we finished in an hour at the most 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.299
 because half an hour already 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.420
 I had disarmament because I was going to be 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:18.430
 confident in me that half is of people 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.430
 that goes very fast 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.570
 I put a braking because that 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.570
 trick question 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.320
 and any point I feel I hope to have 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.750
 removed but at least 180 if there is no other 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:40.120
 for that question 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:43.870
 all practically almost 90 95% 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:47.900
 The exam was given a review and the other 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:51.610
 the other question was simply 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.610
 this logical alga 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.410
 that this logic could be possible 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.720
 use because in the review is 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.289
 he talked a lot about second goes about 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.930
 all the subjects so that they were 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:09.960
 it clear that what he was talking 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:12.809
 it is likely that if I had not had 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.939
 a review in that way 

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:16.319
 those questions that were controversial there 

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:19.050
 they may not have even answered it 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:21.960
 also because when a subject was played 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.129
 specifically, let's say that 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.259
 example when we talk about tasting 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:29.639
 psychometric that letter psychometrics 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:31.830
 gives us so much information if we do not 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:33.629
 we would have abounded in that subject was a 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:39.449
 logical question of that subject in 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:42.569
 particular that the key is in that in 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:46.480
 that participation that exists between 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:49.610
 student teachers perform it 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.949
 yes because that dynamic 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.879
 in the classroom that we all put 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:56.780
 one point of view each and 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:06:00.210
 practically that helps us understand 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:02.759
 even more truthfully 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.790
 the things that we had to learn the 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:08.700
 formula and that thing 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:12.930
 as for example when you are a 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:15.510
 example of memorization and came to another 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.890
 of the classmates and said nonsense 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.640
 of that to continue for you has 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.640
 the mind remained 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:52.490
 we are really talking 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:57.230
 all the teacher's thanks you know 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:58.490
 new colleagues I thought I was going to 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.880
 fail 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:04.850
 he is well scared four years without knowing 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:08.630
 nothing cooling with the fear of 

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:10.710
 fail and I felt very confident when 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:16.910
 I left the waters 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:16.910
 quiet and I 'm going alone 

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:34.120
 already when that exam is over this 

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:34.120
 quiet but is already licensed in me 

00:07:35.239 --> 00:07:43.920
 no no no no 

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.920
 p 

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:48.270
 in the life
