00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
all the time either I just kind of go

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.550 
all the time either I just kind of go
from<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.990> outer<00:03:03.110> corner<00:03:03.260> of<00:03:03.530> my<00:03:03.590> eye<00:03:04.720> and<00:03:05.720> wing

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
from the outer corner of my eye and wing

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.860 
from the outer corner of my eye and wing
it<00:03:06.590> up<00:03:06.920> so<00:03:07.370> that<00:03:07.520> it<00:03:07.610> in<00:03:07.820> pretending<00:03:08.480> that<00:03:08.720> it

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
it up so that it in pretending that it

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.630 
it up so that it in pretending that it
meets<00:03:09.020> the<00:03:09.200> end<00:03:09.350> of<00:03:09.500> my<00:03:09.650> brow<00:03:10.040> or<00:03:10.370> where<00:03:10.520> the

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
meets the end of my brow or where the

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:25.670 
meets the end of my brow or where the
end<00:03:10.730> of<00:03:10.820> my<00:03:10.880> brow<00:03:11.000> should<00:03:11.270> be<00:03:11.420> I<00:03:11.450> guess

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.319 

and<00:03:25.769> then<00:03:26.549> I<00:03:26.579> look<00:03:26.849> to<00:03:26.939> make<00:03:27.030> sure<00:03:27.090> that

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
and then I look to make sure that

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:28.550

they're even which they look like they
are<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:30.750> then<00:03:30.900> I<00:03:30.930> go<00:03:31.230> twist<00:03:32.040> my<00:03:32.129> brush<00:03:32.459> the

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
other way and go forward or towards the

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:47.569 
other way and go forward or towards the
inner<00:03:37.079> corner<00:03:37.500> to<00:03:37.680> kind<00:03:37.859> of<00:03:37.950> fill<00:03:38.730> it<00:03:38.879> in<00:03:46.579> also
