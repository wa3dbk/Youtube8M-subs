00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.670 
this looks great for some reason I think
this<00:01:32.189> will<00:01:32.340> probably<00:01:32.670> sell<00:01:33.000> more<00:01:33.439> than<00:01:34.439> the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
this will probably sell more than the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.340 
this will probably sell more than the
sorcerer<00:01:35.189> Mickey<00:01:35.600> I'm<00:01:36.600> not<00:01:36.780> quite<00:01:36.990> sure<00:01:37.020> why

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350
