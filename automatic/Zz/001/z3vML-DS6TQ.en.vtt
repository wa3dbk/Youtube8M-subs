the cord to the pendant using a larks

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.609 
the cord to the pendant using a larks
head<00:01:04.259> knot<00:01:05.060> by<00:01:06.060> folding<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.990> cord<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.409> half

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
head knot by folding the cord in half

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.910 
head knot by folding the cord in half
like<00:01:07.799> this<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.869> then<00:01:09.869> sticking<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.530> folded

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
like this and then sticking the folded

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.789 
like this and then sticking the folded
end<00:01:11.100> into<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.640> hole<00:01:11.759> dependent<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:13.470> take<00:01:13.649> the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
end into the hole dependent and take the

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.330 
end into the hole dependent and take the
end<00:01:14.009> and<00:01:15.560> stick<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.710> through<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.950> loop<00:01:17.189> and

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
end and stick it through the loop and

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.929 
end and stick it through the loop and
pull<00:01:17.429> it<00:01:17.640> tight<00:01:19.549> like<00:01:20.549> this

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.359 

and<00:01:25.539> make<00:01:25.810> sure<00:01:26.049> the<00:01:26.439> two<00:01:26.740> ends<00:01:27.069> are<00:01:27.159> even

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
and make sure the two ends are even

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.429 
and make sure the two ends are even
about<00:01:27.909> it<00:01:28.299> doesn't<00:01:28.539> have<00:01:28.630> to<00:01:28.689> be<00:01:28.780> exactly<00:01:29.109> even

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
about it doesn't have to be exactly even

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.109 
about it doesn't have to be exactly even
but<00:01:29.469> it<00:01:29.710> should<00:01:29.859> be<00:01:29.890> about<00:01:30.159> even<00:01:30.429> like<00:01:31.439> that

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
but it should be about even like that

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.669 
but it should be about even like that
then<00:01:34.119> if<00:01:34.299> you<00:01:34.329> want<00:01:34.659> to<00:01:34.780> just<00:01:34.869> thread<00:01:35.200> on<00:01:35.380> some

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
then if you want to just thread on some

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.059 
then if you want to just thread on some
beads<00:01:36.009> onto<00:01:36.340> both<00:01:36.880> cords<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.679> beads

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:39.069 
beads onto both cords so the beads

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:40.919 
beads onto both cords so the beads
should<00:01:39.310> have<00:01:39.520> a<00:01:39.549> big<00:01:39.850> hole<00:01:39.880> so<00:01:40.509> that<00:01:40.539> I<00:01:40.659> can<00:01:40.810> go

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
should have a big hole so that I can go

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.149 
should have a big hole so that I can go
over<00:01:40.990> to<00:01:41.939> strand<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:44.140> for<00:01:44.530> someone<00:01:44.679> throw<00:01:44.920> this

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
over to strand so for someone throw this

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:52.770 
over to strand so for someone throw this
bead<00:01:45.490> on<00:01:50.429> then<00:01:51.429> I'm<00:01:51.579> gonna<00:01:51.759> thread<00:01:52.149> this<00:01:52.209> one

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
bead on then I'm gonna thread this one

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:06.110 
bead on then I'm gonna thread this one
on

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.790 

than<00:02:07.120> this<00:02:07.360> beat

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.270 

now<00:02:12.800> we're<00:02:12.980> gonna<00:02:13.070> crimp<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:14.630> clasp<00:02:14.990> on<00:02:15.440> like

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
now we're gonna crimp the clasp on like

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.030 
now we're gonna crimp the clasp on like
this<00:02:16.630> I'm<00:02:17.630> gonna<00:02:17.690> take<00:02:18.020> one<00:02:18.200> is<00:02:18.320> a<00:02:18.350> coil

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.290 

hopefully<00:02:22.040> you<00:02:22.130> can<00:02:22.280> see<00:02:22.580> this<00:02:24.970> so<00:02:25.970> first

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
hopefully you can see this so first

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.260 
hopefully you can see this so first
you're<00:02:26.540> gonna<00:02:26.600> thread<00:02:27.200> a<00:02:27.230> coil<00:02:27.830> onto<00:02:28.730> it<00:02:29.150> with

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
you're gonna thread a coil onto it with

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.600 
you're gonna thread a coil onto it with
the<00:02:29.360> loop<00:02:29.570> side<00:02:30.110> sticking<00:02:30.560> out<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:31.370> one<00:02:31.490> with

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
the loop side sticking out the one with

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.280 
the loop side sticking out the one with
the<00:02:31.700> extended<00:02:32.240> loop<00:02:32.420> that's<00:02:32.780> gonna<00:02:32.960> be<00:02:33.110> on<00:02:33.200> the

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
the extended loop that's gonna be on the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.700 
the extended loop that's gonna be on the
outside<00:02:34.030> I'm<00:02:35.030> going<00:02:35.300> to<00:02:35.420> put<00:02:35.930> it<00:02:36.050> into<00:02:36.350> the

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
outside I'm going to put it into the

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:43.810 
outside I'm going to put it into the
loop<00:02:36.920> coil<00:02:37.310> like<00:02:37.430> this<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:40.150> then<00:02:41.920> crimp<00:02:42.920> the

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
loop coil like this and then crimp the

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.950 
loop coil like this and then crimp the
last<00:02:44.060> two<00:02:44.570> or<00:02:44.750> last<00:02:44.930> uhm<00:02:45.560> coil<00:02:46.600> onto<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.690> cord

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
last two or last uhm coil onto the cord

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:55.380 
last two or last uhm coil onto the cord
with<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.500> pliers<00:02:51.910> so<00:02:52.910> we're<00:02:53.030> going<00:02:53.180> to

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
with the pliers so we're going to

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.760 
with the pliers so we're going to
squeeze<00:02:56.390> that<00:02:56.660> on

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:08.540 

make<00:03:02.340> sure<00:03:02.520> it's<00:03:02.700> tight

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.760 

like<00:03:09.120> that<00:03:09.390> I<00:03:10.220> just<00:03:11.220> finished<00:03:11.550> one<00:03:11.700> side<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.770> can

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
like that I just finished one side I can

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.620 
like that I just finished one side I can
repeat<00:03:14.130> that<00:03:14.190> on<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.520> other<00:03:14.640> side<00:03:17.030> by<00:03:18.030> taking

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
repeat that on the other side by taking

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:25.900 
repeat that on the other side by taking
one<00:03:19.140> of<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.290> coil<00:03:20.870> this<00:03:21.870> threading<00:03:22.650> it<00:03:22.770> on

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
then you're gonna crimp the last two

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.710 
then you're gonna crimp the last two
your<00:03:36.750> last<00:03:37.250> coil<00:03:38.250> on<00:03:39.380> sorry<00:03:40.730> hopefully<00:03:41.730> you

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720
