within 20 yards oh that's another reason

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.539 
within 20 yards oh that's another reason
why<00:01:39.720> we<00:01:39.960> prefer<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.320> turn<00:01:40.770> him<00:01:40.979> right<00:01:41.280> is

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
why we prefer to turn him right is

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.330 
why we prefer to turn him right is
because<00:01:42.150> when<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.200> left<00:01:43.380> leg<00:01:43.530> raises<00:01:44.009> mate

because when the left leg raises mate

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.789 
because when the left leg raises mate
may<00:01:44.640> they<00:01:44.850> can't<00:01:45.180> target<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.840> or<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.560> out<00:01:46.770> of

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
may they can't target it or is out of

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.880 
may they can't target it or is out of
melee<00:01:47.520> range<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.030> we<00:01:48.299> tend<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.320> move<00:01:49.470> him<00:01:49.710> to

so<00:02:52.310> you<00:02:52.370> you<00:02:52.970> have<00:02:53.090> to<00:02:53.180> be<00:02:53.299> really<00:02:53.690> on<00:02:53.810> point

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
so you you have to be really on point

so you you have to be really on point

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
with steering that that's the major

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
poor John steering we usually didn't do

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.140 
poor John steering we usually didn't do
very<00:03:02.720> well<00:03:03.019> in<00:03:03.829> that<00:03:03.950> attempt<00:03:04.459> as<00:03:04.760> you<00:03:04.910> can<00:03:05.030> see

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
very well in that attempt as you can see

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.199 
very well in that attempt as you can see
here<00:03:05.390> there<00:03:05.629> is<00:03:05.870> a<00:03:05.900> another<00:03:06.650> volcano<00:03:07.579> type

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
here there is a another volcano type

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.140 
here there is a another volcano type
that<00:03:08.510> becomes<00:03:08.780> active<00:03:09.290> and<00:03:09.470> its<00:03:10.099> fuse<00:03:10.700> limes

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
that becomes active and its fuse limes

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.039 
that becomes active and its fuse limes
of<00:03:11.890> fire<00:03:12.890> from<00:03:13.220> it<00:03:13.370> if<00:03:14.120> you<00:03:14.209> stand<00:03:14.450> in<00:03:14.660> in<00:03:14.810> it

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
of fire from it if you stand in in it

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.069 
of fire from it if you stand in in it
does<00:03:15.290> massive<00:03:16.250> damage<00:03:16.459> so<00:03:17.329> you<00:03:17.389> really<00:03:18.049> have

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
does massive damage so you really have

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.590 
does massive damage so you really have
to<00:03:18.260> avoid<00:03:18.590> it<00:03:18.739> at<00:03:18.950> all<00:03:19.069> costs<00:03:19.579> and<00:03:19.760> if<00:03:20.269> you<00:03:20.389> hang

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
to avoid it at all costs and if you hang

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.650 
to avoid it at all costs and if you hang
out<00:03:20.750> in<00:03:21.049> it<00:03:21.200> even<00:03:21.590> afterwards<00:03:22.400> which<00:03:23.060> I<00:03:23.450> don't

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
out in it even afterwards which I don't

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.599 
out in it even afterwards which I don't
know<00:03:23.870> why<00:03:24.230> you<00:03:24.290> would<00:03:24.440> but<00:03:24.920> when<00:03:25.130> it<00:03:25.220> erupts

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
know why you would but when it erupts

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.360 
know why you would but when it erupts
like<00:03:25.670> right<00:03:25.940> here<00:03:26.180> it<00:03:26.959> does<00:03:27.260> enough<00:03:27.769> damage<00:03:27.799> to

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
like right here it does enough damage to

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.910 
like right here it does enough damage to
one<00:03:28.549> shot<00:03:28.849> you<00:03:30.430> now<00:03:31.430> as<00:03:32.150> to<00:03:32.599> steering<00:03:33.410> we<00:03:33.739> have

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
really need to turn fast and what we're

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.159 
really need to turn fast and what we're
doing<00:03:44.120> is<00:03:44.239> we're<00:03:44.419> taking<00:03:44.450> him<00:03:44.840> to<00:03:44.989> these

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169 
doing is we're taking him to these

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.349 
doing is we're taking him to these
heated<00:03:45.500> volcanoes<00:03:46.160> here<00:03:46.280> every<00:03:46.489> time<00:03:46.669> he<00:03:46.849> hits

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
heated volcanoes here every time he hits

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.539 
heated volcanoes here every time he hits
a<00:03:47.540> heated<00:03:47.840> volcano<00:03:48.290> he<00:03:48.500> loses<00:03:48.980> stacks<00:03:49.340> and

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
a heated volcano he loses stacks and

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.629 
a heated volcano he loses stacks and
city<00:03:50.030> and<00:03:50.209> armor<00:03:50.569> and<00:03:51.099> we'll<00:03:52.099> start<00:03:52.280> to<00:03:52.430> take

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
city and armor and we'll start to take

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:56.650 
city and armor and we'll start to take
more<00:03:53.090> damage<00:03:54.069> so<00:03:55.069> ideally<00:03:55.849> you<00:03:56.090> turned<00:03:56.510> him

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
more damage so ideally you turned him

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.289 
more damage so ideally you turned him
around<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:57.769> room<00:03:58.010> hit<00:03:58.310> as<00:03:58.400> many<00:03:58.549> volcanoes<00:03:58.819> as

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
around the room hit as many volcanoes as

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.809 
around the room hit as many volcanoes as
you<00:03:59.450> can<00:03:59.630> and<00:03:59.840> once<00:04:00.019> you<00:04:00.200> hit<00:04:00.819> twenty-five

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
you can and once you hit twenty-five

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.990 
you can and once you hit twenty-five
percent<00:04:02.470> you<00:04:03.470> enter<00:04:04.250> into<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.579> last<00:04:04.760> phase

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
percent you enter into the last phase

10<00:04:20.810> min<00:04:20.959> we<00:04:21.109> had<00:04:21.260> a<00:04:21.289> lot<00:04:21.469> of<00:04:21.500> difficulty<00:04:22.099> with

00:04:22.209 --> 00:04:22.219 
10 min we had a lot of difficulty with

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:24.280 
10 min we had a lot of difficulty with
his<00:04:22.340> kill<00:04:22.610> it<00:04:23.240> took<00:04:23.419> us<00:04:23.479> quite<00:04:23.690> a<00:04:23.810> few<00:04:23.990> 10

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
his kill it took us quite a few 10

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.520 
his kill it took us quite a few 10
because<00:04:24.710> we<00:04:25.280> noticed<00:04:25.640> that<00:04:25.790> if<00:04:25.910> we<00:04:26.090> had

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
because we noticed that if we had

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.370 
because we noticed that if we had
volcanoes<00:04:27.530> spawn<00:04:28.010> in<00:04:28.970> bad<00:04:29.660> spots<00:04:29.930> at<00:04:30.290> the

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
volcanoes spawn in bad spots at the

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.810 
volcanoes spawn in bad spots at the
beginning<00:04:30.740> that<00:04:30.890> we<00:04:30.920> could<00:04:31.130> just<00:04:31.280> never<00:04:31.460> catch

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
beginning that we could just never catch

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.960 
beginning that we could just never catch
up<00:04:32.030> and<00:04:32.330> we'd<00:04:32.510> make<00:04:32.840> it<00:04:33.020> to<00:04:33.340> sixty<00:04:34.340> percent<00:04:34.490> in

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
up and we'd make it to sixty percent in

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.910 
up and we'd make it to sixty percent in
and<00:04:35.240> we<00:04:35.330> just<00:04:35.570> have<00:04:35.690> too<00:04:35.930> many<00:04:36.080> volcanoes<00:04:36.380> up

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
and we just have too many volcanoes up

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.390 
and we just have too many volcanoes up
so<00:04:37.190> meaning<00:04:37.490> we<00:04:37.820> had<00:04:38.030> a<00:04:38.060> little<00:04:38.570> bit<00:04:38.840> of

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
so meaning we had a little bit of

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.940 
so meaning we had a little bit of
orangey<00:04:40.400> adapting<00:04:40.970> in<00:04:41.930> this<00:04:42.170> fight<00:04:42.440> to<00:04:42.770> help

orangey adapting in this fight to help

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.160 
orangey adapting in this fight to help
us<00:04:43.070> out<00:04:43.420> another<00:04:44.420> change<00:04:44.840> that<00:04:45.020> they've<00:04:45.140> made

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
us out another change that they've made

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.730 
us out another change that they've made
is<00:04:45.620> that<00:04:46.400> these<00:04:47.020> heated<00:04:48.020> volcanoes<00:04:48.560> are

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
is that these heated volcanoes are

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.890 
is that these heated volcanoes are
applying<00:04:49.010> a<00:04:49.400> debuff<00:04:50.150> to<00:04:50.300> the<00:04:50.390> rape<00:04:50.570> where<00:04:50.840> it

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
applying a debuff to the rape where it

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.930 
applying a debuff to the rape where it
increases<00:04:51.500> damage<00:04:51.680> taken<00:04:52.040> now<00:04:52.520> they're<00:04:52.760> going

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
increases damage taken now they're going

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.570 
increases damage taken now they're going
to<00:04:53.060> separate<00:04:53.450> it<00:04:53.600> so<00:04:54.230> that<00:04:54.470> each<00:04:54.740> volcano<00:04:55.160> does

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
to separate it so that each volcano does

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.780 
to separate it so that each volcano does
a<00:04:55.610> separate<00:04:56.150> stack<00:04:57.280> this<00:04:58.280> will<00:04:58.520> definitely

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
a separate stack this will definitely

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.520 
a separate stack this will definitely
help<00:04:59.330> out<00:04:59.920> as<00:05:00.920> far<00:05:01.250> as<00:05:01.580> having<00:05:02.290> volcanoes<00:05:03.290> up

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
help out as far as having volcanoes up

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.010 
help out as far as having volcanoes up
because<00:05:03.920> now<00:05:04.820> you'll<00:05:05.090> be<00:05:05.150> able<00:05:05.300> to<00:05:05.480> get<00:05:05.780> rid<00:05:05.990> of

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
because now you'll be able to get rid of

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.620 
because now you'll be able to get rid of
individuals<00:05:06.620> tax<00:05:06.830> if<00:05:07.040> if<00:05:07.190> if<00:05:07.580> one<00:05:08.060> is<00:05:08.240> up<00:05:08.420> all

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
individuals tax if if if one is up all

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.750 
individuals tax if if if one is up all
the<00:05:08.780> time<00:05:08.930> is<00:05:09.170> very<00:05:09.380> difficult<00:05:09.590> to<00:05:10.160> get<00:05:10.520> it<00:05:10.610> off

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
the time is very difficult to get it off

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.720 
the time is very difficult to get it off
of<00:05:10.970> the<00:05:11.420> rate<00:05:11.630> and<00:05:12.100> you<00:05:13.100> can<00:05:13.250> end<00:05:13.370> up<00:05:13.520> with<00:05:13.640> the

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
of the rate and you can end up with the

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.470 
of the rate and you can end up with the
rate<00:05:13.880> having<00:05:14.210> 10<00:05:14.510> 11<00:05:15.080> 12<00:05:15.350> stacks<00:05:15.710> and<00:05:16.010> now<00:05:16.480> with

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 
rate having 10 11 12 stacks and now with

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.960 
rate having 10 11 12 stacks and now with
this<00:05:17.630> it<00:05:17.870> helps<00:05:18.290> out<00:05:18.590> a<00:05:18.830> lot<00:05:18.890> more<00:05:19.250> expose<00:05:19.790> you
