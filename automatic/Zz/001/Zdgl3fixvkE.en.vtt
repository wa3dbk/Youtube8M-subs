a<00:00:08.459> firewall<00:00:09.459> is<00:00:09.669> a<00:00:09.700> part<00:00:10.030> of<00:00:10.089> a<00:00:10.179> computer

a firewall is a part of a computer

hardware firewalls are usually set up

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.619 
hardware firewalls are usually set up

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
double check that also enable the spi

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.160 
double check that also enable the spi

recommended<00:02:58.769> to<00:02:58.799> have<00:02:59.069> both<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.549> hardware

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
recommended to have both a hardware

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.699 
recommended to have both a hardware

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.740 

so<00:03:05.709> why<00:03:05.829> use<00:03:06.040> both<00:03:06.310> a<00:03:06.519> hardware<00:03:07.060> firewall<00:03:07.269> and

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
so why use both a hardware firewall and

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.990 
so why use both a hardware firewall and
a<00:03:07.840> software<00:03:08.260> firewall<00:03:08.439> first<00:03:09.400> off<00:03:09.579> hardware

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
a software firewall first off hardware

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.059 
a software firewall first off hardware
