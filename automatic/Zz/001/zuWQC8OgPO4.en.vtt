so<00:00:58.020> that's<00:00:58.739> one<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.250> first<00:00:59.520> checks<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.300> do

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
so that's one of the first checks you do

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.420 
so that's one of the first checks you do
when<00:01:00.899> you're<00:01:01.140> checking<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.829> see<00:01:02.010> if<00:01:02.039> your

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
when you're checking to see if your

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.960 
when you're checking to see if your
pressure<00:01:03.030> tank<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.780> good<00:01:04.199> or<00:01:04.320> bad<00:01:04.580> should<00:01:05.580> have

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
pressure tank is good or bad should have

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.969 
pressure tank is good or bad should have
a<00:01:06.000> hollow<00:01:06.360> sound<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.740> when<00:01:07.890> you're

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
a hollow sound to it when you're

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.179 
a hollow sound to it when you're
knocking<00:01:08.430> on<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.610> top<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.380> more<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.650> solid

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
knocking on the top and more of a solid

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.590 
knocking on the top and more of a solid
sound<00:01:11.520> when<00:01:11.729> you're<00:01:11.820> knocking<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.510> the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
sound when you're knocking on it on the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.070 
sound when you're knocking on it on the
bottom<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:15.500> pressure<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.310> tank<00:01:17.640> should

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
bottom the pressure of the tank should

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:25.399 
bottom the pressure of the tank should
be<00:01:19.080> about<00:01:19.740> 2<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.340> 4<00:01:20.610> psi<00:01:21.479> below<00:01:22.430> your<00:01:24.409> pressure

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
be about 2 to 4 psi below your pressure

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.719 
be about 2 to 4 psi below your pressure
switch<00:01:26.150> low-cut<00:01:27.150> out<00:01:28.009> so<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.220> low<00:01:29.400> pressure

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
switch low-cut out so the low pressure

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.240 
switch low-cut out so the low pressure
cut<00:01:30.299> outside<00:01:30.750> normally<00:01:31.350> around<00:01:31.560> 40<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:34.250> so

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
cut outside normally around 40 and so

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.130 
cut outside normally around 40 and so
the<00:01:35.520> pressure<00:01:36.000> tank<00:01:36.420> should<00:01:36.689> have<00:01:36.900> about<00:01:37.670> 38

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
the pressure tank should have about 38

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.830 
the pressure tank should have about 38
psi<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.670> if<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:41.850> low<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.060> can<00:01:42.509> use<00:01:42.630> one<00:01:42.810> of

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
psi in it if it's low you can use one of

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.300 
psi in it if it's low you can use one of
these<00:01:42.960> little<00:01:43.729> air<00:01:44.729> tanks<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.950> just<00:01:46.950> that's

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
these little air tanks and just that's

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.069 
these little air tanks and just that's
how<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.490> do<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.700> just<00:01:47.820> put<00:01:47.970> air<00:01:48.240> just<00:01:48.720> put<00:01:48.930> air

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
how you do it just put air just put air

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.780 
how you do it just put air just put air
in<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.350> at<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.530> top<00:01:49.770> there<00:01:50.130> just<00:01:50.399> like<00:01:50.490> putting

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
in it at the top there just like putting

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.060 
in it at the top there just like putting
air<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.030> tire<00:01:54.439> just<00:01:55.439> like<00:01:55.590> putting<00:01:55.799> there<00:01:55.979> in

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
air in a tire just like putting there in

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.319 
air in a tire just like putting there in
a<00:01:56.130> tire<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:58.520> occasionally<00:01:59.520> these<00:01:59.729> things<00:02:00.090> do

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
a tire and occasionally these things do

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.440 
a tire and occasionally these things do
go<00:02:00.600> go<00:02:01.409> low<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.710> air<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.700> should<00:02:02.880> make<00:02:03.420> sure

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
go go low and air you should make sure

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.959 
go go low and air you should make sure
the<00:02:03.750> air<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.250> good<00:02:05.250> in<00:02:05.399> there<00:02:05.579> before<00:02:05.759> you

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
the air is good in there before you

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.809 
the air is good in there before you
start<00:02:06.630> calling<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:07.200> plumber

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.520 

this<00:02:12.819> system<00:02:13.390> here<00:02:13.569> I'm<00:02:13.720> working<00:02:13.930> on<00:02:14.260> is

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
this system here I'm working on is

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.110 
this system here I'm working on is
really<00:02:15.190> old<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:17.160> down<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.370> out<00:02:18.459> it's<00:02:18.819> short

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
really old and down and out it's short

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.210 
really old and down and out it's short
cycling<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:19.750> needs<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:19.989> lot<00:02:20.110> of<00:02:20.140> work<00:02:21.209> so

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
cycling it needs a lot of work so

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.500 
cycling it needs a lot of work so
putting<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.400> little<00:02:24.550> air<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:24.940> this<00:02:25.030> pressure

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
putting a little air and this pressure

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.949 
putting a little air and this pressure
tanks<00:02:25.959> not<00:02:26.110> going<00:02:26.349> to<00:02:26.440> help<00:02:27.060> because<00:02:28.060> there's

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
tanks not going to help because there's

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.550 
tanks not going to help because there's
just<00:02:29.019> not<00:02:29.380> enough<00:02:29.440> water<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:30.250> as<00:02:30.370> well<00:02:30.640> and

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
just not enough water and as well and

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.020 
just not enough water and as well and
also<00:02:32.560> if<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:32.739> notice<00:02:33.040> there's<00:02:33.220> no<00:02:33.400> pressure

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
also if you notice there's no pressure

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.970 
also if you notice there's no pressure

made<00:02:36.340> assistant<00:02:37.060> Li<00:02:37.180> they<00:02:37.870> didn't<00:02:38.440> put<00:02:38.650> no

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
made assistant Li they didn't put no

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.259 
made assistant Li they didn't put no
pressure<00:02:38.800> gauge<00:02:39.550> in<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:42.880> have<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.150> have<00:02:43.239> a

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
pressure gauge in the you have to have a

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:44.309 
pressure gauge in the you have to have a
pressure<00:02:43.510> you<00:02:43.690> should<00:02:43.720> have<00:02:43.989> a<00:02:44.049> pressure

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
pressure you should have a pressure

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.380 
pressure you should have a pressure
gauge<00:02:44.620> in<00:02:44.920> line<00:02:45.130> there<00:02:45.400> somewhere<00:02:45.819> pretty

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
gauge in line there somewhere pretty

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.070 
gauge in line there somewhere pretty
close<00:02:46.660> to<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:48.060> switch<00:02:49.060> there<00:02:49.299> CV<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:49.660> pressure

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
close to the switch there CV a pressure

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.750 
close to the switch there CV a pressure
switch<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:53.500> this<00:02:53.769> system<00:02:54.040> going<00:02:54.549> to<00:02:54.640> need

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
switch and so this system going to need

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.080 
switch and so this system going to need
a<00:02:54.790> lot<00:02:54.970> of<00:02:55.000> work<00:02:55.269> but<00:02:56.040> this<00:02:57.040> is<00:02:57.250> a<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.849> first

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
a lot of work but this is a the first

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.140 
a lot of work but this is a the first
check<00:02:58.390> you<00:02:58.569> do<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.049> detect<00:02:59.860> tell<00:03:00.819> if<00:03:01.000> your

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
check you do and detect tell if your

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.110 
check you do and detect tell if your
tank<00:03:01.390> is<00:03:01.630> good<00:03:01.840> or<00:03:01.959> not
