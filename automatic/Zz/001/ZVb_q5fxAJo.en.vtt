talk you know just the basic type of
shit<00:03:41.269> but<00:03:41.810> I<00:03:41.870> thought<00:03:42.170> he<00:03:42.260> did<00:03:42.410> a<00:03:42.440> good<00:03:42.620> job<00:03:42.680> of

shit but I thought he did a good job of

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.860 
shit but I thought he did a good job of
keeping<00:03:43.280> it<00:03:43.579> interesting<00:03:43.880> and<00:03:44.329> putting

keeping it interesting and putting

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.050 
keeping it interesting and putting
emotion<00:03:45.500> into<00:03:46.040> these<00:03:46.190> songs<00:03:46.489> so<00:03:46.760> it's<00:03:46.910> not

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
emotion into these songs so it's not

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.000 
emotion into these songs so it's not
really<00:03:47.389> too<00:03:47.660> boring<00:03:47.959> and<00:03:48.319> it<00:03:48.590> doesn't<00:03:48.889> really

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
really too boring and it doesn't really

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.860 
really too boring and it doesn't really
get<00:03:49.220> too<00:03:49.459> repetitive<00:03:49.760> surprisingly<00:03:50.569> after

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
get too repetitive surprisingly after

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.270
