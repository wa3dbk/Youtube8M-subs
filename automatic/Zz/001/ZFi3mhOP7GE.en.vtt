pretty funny because I had a lot of

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.870 
pretty funny because I had a lot of
different<00:03:14.230> ideas<00:03:14.860> and<00:03:14.890> what<00:03:15.250> I<00:03:15.280> wanted<00:03:15.580> to<00:03:15.700> be

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
different ideas and what I wanted to be

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.140 
different ideas and what I wanted to be
and<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:17.500> know<00:03:17.560> it's<00:03:17.710> kind<00:03:17.890> of<00:03:17.920> like<00:03:18.040> how<00:03:18.490> sound

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
and you know it's kind of like how sound

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.640 
and you know it's kind of like how sound
frequency<00:03:19.780> and<00:03:20.550> color<00:03:21.550> frequency<00:03:22.650> are

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
frequency and color frequency are

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.790 
frequency and color frequency are
completely<00:03:24.580> intertwined<00:03:25.090> and<00:03:25.530> that<00:03:26.530> we<00:03:26.740> are

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
completely intertwined and that we are

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.950 
completely intertwined and that we are
just<00:03:27.120> like<00:03:28.120> a<00:03:28.270> note<00:03:28.570> in<00:03:28.870> that<00:03:28.930> frequency<00:03:29.590> so

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
just like a note in that frequency so

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.820 
just like a note in that frequency so
we're<00:03:31.960> the<00:03:32.530> color<00:03:33.100> of<00:03:33.220> sound<00:03:33.580> or<00:03:33.910> where<00:03:34.360> the

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
we're the color of sound or where the

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.340 
we're the color of sound or where the
where<00:03:35.830> the<00:03:35.860> sound<00:03:36.240> that<00:03:37.240> colors<00:03:37.690> make<00:03:37.900> up<00:03:38.110> I

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
where the sound that colors make up I

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.680 
where the sound that colors make up I
can't<00:03:38.980> describe<00:03:39.400> it<00:03:39.550> in<00:03:39.700> two<00:03:40.000> seconds<00:03:40.420> but

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
can't describe it in two seconds but

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.230 
can't describe it in two seconds but
that's<00:03:40.990> where<00:03:41.230> DJ<00:03:41.590> prism<00:03:41.950> comes<00:03:42.190> from<00:03:42.459> it's
