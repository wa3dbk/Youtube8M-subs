00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.090 
wanted to find out what the pedal
response<00:01:23.990> was<00:01:24.170> like<00:01:24.350> from<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:24.740> carbon

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
response was like from the carbon

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.100 
response was like from the carbon
ceramic<00:01:25.280> discs<00:01:25.880> just<00:01:26.600> to<00:01:26.690> get<00:01:26.840> a<00:01:26.869> bit<00:01:26.990> more

but<00:01:59.179> unlike<00:01:59.479> quite<00:01:59.780> a<00:01:59.810> few<00:02:00.110> racing<00:02:00.530> cars<00:02:00.800> I've

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
but unlike quite a few racing cars I've

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.370 
but unlike quite a few racing cars I've
driven<00:02:01.039> in<00:02:01.399> the<00:02:01.490> past<00:02:01.729> it's<00:02:02.390> not<00:02:02.780> edgy<00:02:03.050> or

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
driven in the past it's not edgy or

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.800 
driven in the past it's not edgy or
difficult<00:02:03.830> to<00:02:03.950> drive<00:02:04.130> on<00:02:04.369> its<00:02:04.520> limit<00:02:04.850> in<00:02:05.600> fact

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.940 
difficult to drive on its limit in fact
it's<00:02:05.929> quite<00:02:06.050> the<00:02:06.140> opposite<00:02:06.590> and<00:02:07.030> it<00:02:08.030> sounds

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
it's quite the opposite and it sounds

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.940 
it's quite the opposite and it sounds
absolutely<00:02:09.950> fantastic<00:02:11.260> which<00:02:12.260> is<00:02:12.410> my<00:02:12.590> cue<00:02:12.920> to

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
absolutely fantastic which is my cue to

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
the brakes the way this car just stands

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.730 
the brakes the way this car just stands
on<00:03:01.100> its<00:03:01.250> nose<00:03:01.490> and<00:03:01.850> stops<00:03:02.240> even<00:03:02.690> from<00:03:02.930> 160

miles<00:03:03.950> an<00:03:04.100> hour<00:03:04.220> at<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.459> end<00:03:04.520> of<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.700> hangar

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.410 
miles an hour at the end of the hangar
straight<00:03:05.030> is<00:03:05.480> just<00:03:06.370> incredible<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:08.150> I<00:03:08.239> guess

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
straight is just incredible and I guess

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.420 
straight is just incredible and I guess
in<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:08.810> end<00:03:08.840> that's<00:03:09.470> what<00:03:09.620> makes<00:03:09.920> these<00:03:10.160> cars

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
in the end that's what makes these cars

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.670 
in the end that's what makes these cars
so<00:03:10.730> good<00:03:10.910> to<00:03:11.060> race<00:03:11.209> because<00:03:11.930> you<00:03:12.020> really<00:03:12.410> can
