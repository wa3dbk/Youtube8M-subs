 making origami 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.860
 You can continue to work on the previous one. 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.580
 project or download the file from 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.110
 model in this case the model has 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.200
 skeleton tuned modifier with 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.769
 Kiev eyes and jaw fungi should be 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.290
 separate independent 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.290
 objects 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:22.269
 Run the violins and point the models. 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:24.150
 ships or character 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.500
 also show the language model script 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.390
 lower and upper jaw and eye patterns 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.330
 when using complex models 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.989
 class you can use ordinary 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.309
 spheres as ancestors for the future 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.280
 class note for 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.370
 correct work script fall for 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.510
 this class should look away 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.059
 pupil then tune point 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.620
 center of future bones of the eye 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.000
 download melted models from earlier 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 saved file 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.130
 hold all the nodal points and make sure that 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.430
 everything is built right if necessary 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.230
 trim point and sang save 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.220
 fused model if not model already has 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.920
 in the ditch then indicate the cranial bones of this 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.790
 skeleton it is necessary in order 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.040
 to modify existing 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.140
 skin modifier and add and anger 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.160
 Bonya Face bones to control objects 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.990
 created as accurately as possible 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.230
 can be applied stroking model 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.010
 click the craig picnic button does not start and 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.479
 creation of facial bones and managers 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.479
 of objects 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.640
 after this igso astana you say 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.020
 by intrigue and other unnecessary objects to 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.640
 unload windows projects and speed up 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.329
 screen shovel process 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.630
 customize the desired size 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.689
 objects and bones move 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:51.999
 control objects and carefully 

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:53.950
 check work legally special 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.899
 pay attention to the class when 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.599
 need move bodies 

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:00.299
 control objects so what is glass with 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.879
 exactly matched 

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:04.879
 models 

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:21.709
 when all kotovo push ex button 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.419
 Akim and run the process 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:26.059
 automatic kin creation if 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:28.249
 sketch of the model is already in this 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:31.169
 case it will be modified by him 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:33.389
 will be added to the foreigner so 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:35.699
 slaughter face after skin is ready 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:37.449
 move control objects 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:38.609
 to identify weaknesses 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.609
 automatic satino 

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:52.689
 if necessary, build a UFO Pistina 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:55.689
 in the usual way 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.989
 on this process of creating a face system 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.459
 emergency gang finished the next stage 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.359
 tuning the mechanics of this system
