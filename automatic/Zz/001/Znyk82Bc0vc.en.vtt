probably<00:01:37.590> Boston<00:01:38.070> has<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.720> modest<00:01:39.720> edge<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.140> go

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
probably Boston has a modest edge and go

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.260 
probably Boston has a modest edge and go
with<00:01:40.470> Tuukka<00:01:40.740> Rask<00:01:40.770> as<00:01:41.189> well<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.970> I'm<00:01:42.150> looking

Boston what do you think Joe well no

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.020 
Boston what do you think Joe well no
it's<00:02:02.009> one<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.310> those<00:02:02.430> where<00:02:02.700> if<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.880> were

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
it's one of those where if I were

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.639 
it's one of those where if I were
actually<00:02:03.570> picking<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.110> just<00:02:04.350> straight<00:02:04.619> up

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
actually picking it just straight up

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.499 
actually picking it just straight up
without<00:02:04.979> having<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.430> worry<00:02:05.670> about<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:06.000> line<00:02:06.270> I

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
without having to worry about a line I

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.419 
without having to worry about a line I
would<00:02:06.780> pick<00:02:06.990> Boston<00:02:07.500> but<00:02:07.680> Montreal<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.399> a

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
would pick Boston but Montreal is a

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.430 
would pick Boston but Montreal is a
dangerous<00:02:09.060> underdog<00:02:09.599> there's<00:02:09.899> six<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.319> one

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
dangerous underdog there's six and one

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.890 
dangerous underdog there's six and one
in<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.619> series<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.550> road<00:02:11.819> team<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.420> seven<00:02:12.810> and

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
in the series the road team is seven and

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.240 
in the series the road team is seven and
two

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
two

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.220 
two
I<00:02:13.310> do<00:02:13.640> think<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.180> Montreal<00:02:14.870> is<00:02:14.960> going<00:02:15.140> to

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
I do think that Montreal is going to

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.990 
I do think that Montreal is going to
have<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.620> win<00:02:15.800> early<00:02:16.340> to<00:02:16.520> make<00:02:16.670> sure<00:02:16.850> they

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
have to win early to make sure they

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.670 
have to win early to make sure they
still<00:02:17.270> have<00:02:17.360> that<00:02:17.450> confidence<00:02:17.870> over<00:02:18.290> Boston

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
still have that confidence over Boston

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.400 
still have that confidence over Boston
cuz<00:02:18.800> of<00:02:18.920> Boston<00:02:19.370> is<00:02:19.610> able<00:02:20.210> to<00:02:20.270> sweep<00:02:20.600> the<00:02:20.900> games

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
cuz of Boston is able to sweep the games

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
cuz of Boston is able to sweep the games
at<00:02:21.620> home<00:02:21.800> they're<00:02:22.040> going<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.250> get<00:02:22.310> the

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
at home they're going to get the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.830 
at home they're going to get the
momentum<00:02:22.670> going<00:02:22.820> their<00:02:23.210> way<00:02:23.240> they're<00:02:23.690> going

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
momentum going their way they're going

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.230 
momentum going their way they're going
to<00:02:23.900> erase<00:02:24.230> any<00:02:24.530> series<00:02:25.220> edge<00:02:25.430> that<00:02:25.700> Boston<00:02:26.210> had

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
to erase any series edge that Boston had

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.500 
to erase any series edge that Boston had
but<00:02:26.710> Montreal<00:02:27.710> or<00:02:28.340> Montreal<00:02:28.940> has<00:02:29.180> played

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
but Montreal or Montreal has played

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.510 
but Montreal or Montreal has played
Boston<00:02:29.750> extremely<00:02:30.620> well<00:02:30.770> but<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.100> end<00:02:31.280> of<00:02:31.430> the

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
Boston extremely well but the end of the

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.090 
Boston extremely well but the end of the
day<00:02:31.750> Boston<00:02:32.750> is<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.170> better<00:02:33.350> team<00:02:33.590> and<00:02:33.800> as<00:02:33.890> you

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
day Boston is the better team and as you

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.190 
day Boston is the better team and as you
said<00:02:34.370> what<00:02:34.550> Montreal<00:02:35.150> does<00:02:35.360> well<00:02:35.570> Boston<00:02:35.870> does

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
said what Montreal does well Boston does

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.870 
said what Montreal does well Boston does
a<00:02:36.230> little<00:02:36.440> bit<00:02:36.590> better<00:02:36.709> Montreal<00:02:37.400> goes<00:02:37.580> for

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
a little bit better Montreal goes for

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.300 
a little bit better Montreal goes for
deep<00:02:38.240> on<00:02:38.510> their<00:02:39.050> lines<00:02:39.260> but<00:02:39.500> Boston<00:02:39.920> is<00:02:40.040> even

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
deep on their lines but Boston is even

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.880 
deep on their lines but Boston is even
better<00:02:40.540> you<00:02:41.540> know<00:02:41.630> obviously<00:02:41.810> Montreal<00:02:42.709> has<00:02:42.860> a

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
better you know obviously Montreal has a

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.770 
better you know obviously Montreal has a
heck<00:02:43.100> of<00:02:43.130> a<00:02:43.310> goalie<00:02:43.520> in<00:02:43.730> price<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.120> certainly

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
heck of a goalie in price and certainly

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.360 
heck of a goalie in price and certainly
the<00:02:44.990> fact<00:02:45.200> that<00:02:45.230> he<00:02:45.320> played<00:02:45.560> very<00:02:45.860> well<00:02:46.070> in<00:02:46.130> the

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
the fact that he played very well in the

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.970 
the fact that he played very well in the
Olympics<00:02:46.790> means<00:02:47.540> a<00:02:47.780> ton<00:02:47.959> but<00:02:48.200> Tuukka<00:02:48.500> Rask<00:02:48.530> has

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
Olympics means a ton but Tuukka Rask has

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.620 
Olympics means a ton but Tuukka Rask has
been<00:02:49.160> doing<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:49.550> a<00:02:49.640> little<00:02:49.760> bit<00:02:50.000> longer<00:02:50.239> so<00:02:50.540> you

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
been doing it a little bit longer so you

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.330 
been doing it a little bit longer so you
give<00:02:50.840> boss<00:02:51.020> in<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.350> slight<00:02:51.620> edge<00:02:51.650> there<00:02:52.130> and

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
give boss in the slight edge there and

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.130 
give boss in the slight edge there and
then<00:02:52.730> of<00:02:52.880> course<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:53.420> brilliance<00:02:53.810> with<00:02:53.959> that

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
then of course the brilliance with that

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.020 
then of course the brilliance with that
physical<00:02:54.650> defense<00:02:55.220> led<00:02:55.430> by<00:02:55.550> Zdeno<00:02:55.910> Chara

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
physical defense led by Zdeno Chara

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.000 
physical defense led by Zdeno Chara
there<00:02:56.750> a<00:02:56.780> little<00:02:56.930> bit<00:02:57.050> better<00:02:57.230> on<00:02:57.320> defense<00:02:57.410> so

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
there a little bit better on defense so

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.100 
there a little bit better on defense so
you<00:02:58.459> know<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:58.760> Boston<00:02:59.360> gets<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.720> slight<00:03:00.080> edge

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
you know the Boston gets the slight edge

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.620 
you know the Boston gets the slight edge
just<00:03:00.709> about<00:03:01.010> everywhere<00:03:01.550> other<00:03:02.209> than<00:03:02.480> the

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
just about everywhere other than the

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.930 
just about everywhere other than the
fact<00:03:02.810> that<00:03:02.989> Montreal<00:03:03.620> certainly<00:03:04.370> shown<00:03:04.730> in

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
fact that Montreal certainly shown in

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.699 
fact that Montreal certainly shown in
the<00:03:05.030> head-to-head<00:03:05.239> meetings<00:03:05.720> that<00:03:06.350> they<00:03:06.530> can

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
the head-to-head meetings that they can

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.650 
the head-to-head meetings that they can
keep<00:03:06.860> up<00:03:07.070> with<00:03:07.100> them<00:03:07.430> but<00:03:07.910> I<00:03:07.970> think<00:03:08.300> that's<00:03:08.480> the

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
keep up with them but I think that's the

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.390 
keep up with them but I think that's the
wanted<00:03:09.020> man<00:03:09.170> if<00:03:09.380> the<00:03:09.500> Montreal<00:03:10.070> has<00:03:10.190> shown

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
wanted man if the Montreal has shown

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
wanted man if the Montreal has shown
they've<00:03:10.580> done<00:03:10.760> well<00:03:10.970> in<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.209> head-to-head

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
they've done well in the head-to-head

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.930 
they've done well in the head-to-head
but<00:03:11.870> still<00:03:12.080> Boston<00:03:12.590> with<00:03:12.709> a<00:03:12.739> slight<00:03:13.220> edge<00:03:13.520> just

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
but still Boston with a slight edge just

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.580 
but still Boston with a slight edge just
about<00:03:14.150> everywhere<00:03:14.660> and<00:03:15.050> I<00:03:15.170> think<00:03:15.410> they<00:03:15.530> were

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
about everywhere and I think they were

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.650 
about everywhere and I think they were
winning<00:03:15.800> sex<00:03:16.310> all<00:03:16.730> right<00:03:16.880> now<00:03:17.030> here's<00:03:17.480> what

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
winning sex all right now here's what

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.300 
winning sex all right now here's what
I'm<00:03:17.750> thinking<00:03:18.200> you<00:03:18.500> said<00:03:18.680> that<00:03:18.799> the<00:03:18.890> road<00:03:19.070> team

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
I'm thinking you said that the road team

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.550 
I'm thinking you said that the road team
in<00:03:19.340> this<00:03:19.760> series<00:03:20.000> has<00:03:20.480> had<00:03:20.690> an<00:03:20.840> advantage<00:03:21.110> I'm

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
in this series has had an advantage I'm

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.199 
in this series has had an advantage I'm
thinking<00:03:21.890> though<00:03:22.040> that<00:03:22.280> probably<00:03:22.850> the<00:03:23.030> home

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
thinking though that probably the home

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.660 
thinking though that probably the home
teams<00:03:23.510> are<00:03:23.870> going<00:03:24.049> to<00:03:24.140> be<00:03:24.350> the<00:03:24.860> way<00:03:25.190> to<00:03:25.220> go<00:03:25.340> in

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
teams are going to be the way to go in

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.729 
teams are going to be the way to go in
this<00:03:25.730> series<00:03:26.420> probably<00:03:26.930> you<00:03:27.019> know<00:03:27.080> the<00:03:27.320> home

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
this series probably you know the home

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.830 
this series probably you know the home
team's<00:03:27.980> ma<00:03:28.430> Chau<00:03:28.640> is<00:03:28.700> a<00:03:28.790> big<00:03:29.030> home<00:03:29.299> ice<00:03:29.570> edge

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
team's ma Chau is a big home ice edge

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.509 
team's ma Chau is a big home ice edge
then<00:03:30.320> when<00:03:30.440> they<00:03:30.500> go<00:03:30.620> to<00:03:30.680> Boston<00:03:31.190> Boston's

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
then when they go to Boston Boston's

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.640 
then when they go to Boston Boston's
able<00:03:31.760> to<00:03:31.850> slow<00:03:32.030> down<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.420> game<00:03:32.570> a<00:03:33.080> little<00:03:33.530> bit

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
able to slow down the game a little bit

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.500 
able to slow down the game a little bit
but<00:03:34.040> so<00:03:34.519> I<00:03:34.549> was<00:03:34.760> thinking<00:03:34.820> maybe<00:03:35.150> that<00:03:35.420> we

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
but so I was thinking maybe that we

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.539 
but so I was thinking maybe that we
recommend<00:03:36.049> that<00:03:36.230> your<00:03:36.890> is<00:03:37.040> just<00:03:37.220> bet<00:03:37.370> on<00:03:37.459> the

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
recommend that your is just bet on the

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.340 
recommend that your is just bet on the
home<00:03:37.760> team<00:03:38.030> in<00:03:38.269> each<00:03:38.600> game<00:03:38.810> this<00:03:38.989> series<00:03:39.200> do

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
home team in each game this series do

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.570 
home team in each game this series do
you<00:03:39.440> think<00:03:39.620> the<00:03:39.769> road<00:03:39.950> teams<00:03:40.130> might<00:03:40.340> have<00:03:40.459> an

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
you think the road teams might have an

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.640 
you think the road teams might have an
advantage<00:03:40.750> well<00:03:41.750> you<00:03:41.989> know<00:03:42.110> obviously<00:03:42.230> you're

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
advantage well you know obviously you're

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.740 
advantage well you know obviously you're
gonna<00:03:42.739> have<00:03:42.980> to<00:03:43.100> lay<00:03:43.220> a<00:03:43.250> big<00:03:43.670> number<00:03:44.060> and<00:03:44.239> the

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
gonna have to lay a big number and the

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.870 
gonna have to lay a big number and the
truth<00:03:45.019> is<00:03:45.230> and<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:45.470> NHL<00:03:46.040> playoffs<00:03:46.489> especially

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
truth is and the NHL playoffs especially

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.000 
truth is and the NHL playoffs especially
once<00:03:47.660> you<00:03:47.750> get<00:03:47.900> past<00:03:47.930> the<00:03:48.290> first<00:03:48.470> round<00:03:48.650> where

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
once you get past the first round where

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.800 
once you get past the first round where
both<00:03:49.130> teams<00:03:49.430> are<00:03:49.670> playing<00:03:49.760> well<00:03:50.150> that<00:03:50.450> betting

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
both teams are playing well that betting

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.660 
both teams are playing well that betting
on<00:03:50.959> underdogs<00:03:51.530> has<00:03:51.739> always<00:03:52.010> been<00:03:52.130> a<00:03:52.190> good<00:03:52.400> play

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
on underdogs has always been a good play

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.850 
on underdogs has always been a good play
so<00:03:52.730> you're<00:03:53.540> asking<00:03:53.720> me<00:03:54.049> to<00:03:54.079> lay<00:03:54.350> some<00:03:54.650> big

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
so you're asking me to lay some big

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.530 
so you're asking me to lay some big
lumber<00:03:55.220> here<00:03:55.459> so<00:03:55.670> I<00:03:55.700> don't<00:03:56.060> know<00:03:56.269> if<00:03:56.299> I<00:03:56.480> can

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
lumber here so I don't know if I can

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.870 
lumber here so I don't know if I can
necessarily<00:03:56.959> agree<00:03:57.709> with<00:03:57.739> that<00:03:57.920> but<00:03:58.280> you<00:03:58.760> know

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
necessarily agree with that but you know

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.370 
necessarily agree with that but you know
the<00:03:59.000> interesting<00:03:59.480> thing<00:03:59.930> is<00:03:59.959> that<00:04:00.079> Peter

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
the interesting thing is that Peter

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.470 
the interesting thing is that Peter
Budaj<00:04:00.829> the<00:04:00.890> Montreal's<00:04:01.700> backup<00:04:02.239> goaltender

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
Budaj the Montreal's backup goaltender

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.870 
Budaj the Montreal's backup goaltender
has<00:04:03.079> played<00:04:03.739> against<00:04:04.040> Boston<00:04:04.489> he's<00:04:04.640> played

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
has played against Boston he's played

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.610 
has played against Boston he's played
extremely<00:04:05.299> well<00:04:05.420> he's<00:04:05.810> certainly<00:04:06.019> not<00:04:06.380> going

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
extremely well he's certainly not going

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.890 
extremely well he's certainly not going
to<00:04:06.799> be<00:04:06.950> playing<00:04:07.880> starting<00:04:08.420> in<00:04:08.510> any<00:04:08.660> of<00:04:08.780> these

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
to be playing starting in any of these

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.560 
to be playing starting in any of these
games<00:04:09.230> unless<00:04:09.739> somehow<00:04:10.370> price<00:04:10.850> is<00:04:11.060> chased<00:04:11.329> out

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
games unless somehow price is chased out

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.509 
games unless somehow price is chased out
of<00:04:11.600> the<00:04:11.810> net<00:04:11.989> so<00:04:12.290> that's<00:04:12.799> one<00:04:12.980> of<00:04:13.010> those<00:04:13.160> weird

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
of the net so that's one of those weird

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.910 
of the net so that's one of those weird
anomalies<00:04:14.239> that<00:04:14.269> that<00:04:14.780> Montreal<00:04:15.620> has<00:04:15.739> done

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
anomalies that that Montreal has done

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.380 
anomalies that that Montreal has done
well<00:04:16.190> but<00:04:16.459> yet<00:04:16.640> with<00:04:16.850> their<00:04:17.000> backup

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
well but yet with their backup

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.440 
well but yet with their backup
goaltender<00:04:17.660> so<00:04:18.320> yeah<00:04:18.890> all<00:04:19.130> in<00:04:19.340> all<00:04:19.489> I<00:04:19.760> do<00:04:19.940> think

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
goaltender so yeah all in all I do think

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.390 
goaltender so yeah all in all I do think
that<00:04:20.510> Montreal<00:04:21.140> is<00:04:21.260> capable<00:04:21.709> of<00:04:21.770> stealing<00:04:22.099> a

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
that Montreal is capable of stealing a

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.000 
that Montreal is capable of stealing a
game<00:04:22.640> in<00:04:22.880> Boston<00:04:23.419> but<00:04:23.570> probably<00:04:24.080> not<00:04:24.680> all<00:04:24.979> that

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
game in Boston but probably not all that

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.940 
game in Boston but probably not all that
more<00:04:25.430> than<00:04:25.490> that

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
more than that

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.340 
more than that
and<00:04:26.010> it<00:04:26.130> may<00:04:26.310> be<00:04:26.370> as<00:04:26.820> you<00:04:27.060> said<00:04:27.390> if<00:04:27.750> you<00:04:27.960> do<00:04:28.080> have

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
and it may be as you said if you do have

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.440 
and it may be as you said if you do have
you<00:04:28.650> know<00:04:28.770> we<00:04:28.980> used<00:04:29.130> to<00:04:29.250> call<00:04:29.790> the<00:04:29.970> old<00:04:30.120> split

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
you know we used to call the old split

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.910 
you know we used to call the old split
line<00:04:30.600> available<00:04:31.110> where<00:04:31.230> you<00:04:31.260> can<00:04:31.350> lay<00:04:31.710> the

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
line available where you can lay the

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.890 
line available where you can lay the
goal<00:04:32.130> and<00:04:32.310> a<00:04:32.400> half<00:04:32.670> and<00:04:32.910> then<00:04:33.000> get<00:04:33.510> the<00:04:33.660> juice

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
goal and a half and then get the juice

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.570 
goal and a half and then get the juice
back<00:04:34.200> that<00:04:34.470> might<00:04:34.680> be<00:04:34.890> the<00:04:35.040> good<00:04:35.160> play<00:04:35.400> if<00:04:35.520> you

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
back that might be the good play if you

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.100 
back that might be the good play if you
want<00:04:35.640> to<00:04:35.850> play<00:04:36.000> the<00:04:36.180> home<00:04:36.330> team<00:04:36.630> because<00:04:36.900> I<00:04:36.930> do

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
want to play the home team because I do

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.830 
want to play the home team because I do
think<00:04:37.590> that<00:04:37.800> you<00:04:38.580> know<00:04:38.700> if<00:04:38.820> Montreal<00:04:39.510> falls

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
think that you know if Montreal falls

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.410 
think that you know if Montreal falls
behind<00:04:40.140> that<00:04:41.040> boss<00:04:41.280> and<00:04:41.550> can<00:04:41.700> certainly<00:04:42.030> blow

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
behind that boss and can certainly blow

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.090 
behind that boss and can certainly blow
them<00:04:42.630> out<00:04:42.780> and<00:04:42.900> that's<00:04:43.050> really<00:04:43.260> the<00:04:43.440> key<00:04:43.860> is

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
them out and that's really the key is

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.210 
them out and that's really the key is
and<00:04:44.880> remember<00:04:45.390> the<00:04:45.630> Patrick<00:04:46.170> wall<00:04:46.380> intangible

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
and remember the Patrick wall intangible

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.890 
and remember the Patrick wall intangible
where<00:04:47.550> teams<00:04:47.850> are<00:04:48.120> pulling<00:04:48.480> their<00:04:48.600> goalie

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
where teams are pulling their goalie

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.260 
where teams are pulling their goalie
much<00:04:49.500> sooner<00:04:49.860> than<00:04:50.220> they<00:04:50.610> have<00:04:50.820> in<00:04:50.850> the<00:04:51.000> past

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
much sooner than they have in the past

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.910 
much sooner than they have in the past
of<00:04:51.480> those<00:04:51.600> empty<00:04:51.930> net<00:04:52.110> goals<00:04:52.320> are<00:04:52.530> much<00:04:52.710> more

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
of those empty net goals are much more

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.920 
of those empty net goals are much more
prevalent<00:04:53.220> so<00:04:53.880> I<00:04:53.910> think<00:04:54.030> laying<00:04:54.450> the<00:04:54.570> goal<00:04:54.750> and

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
prevalent so I think laying the goal and

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.050 
prevalent so I think laying the goal and
a<00:04:55.020> half<00:04:55.200> if<00:04:55.350> you<00:04:55.470> like<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:55.800> favor<00:04:56.070> is<00:04:56.400> really<00:04:57.030> a

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
a half if you like the favor is really a

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.240 
a half if you like the favor is really a
smart<00:04:57.270> play<00:04:57.660> right<00:04:58.050> awesome<00:04:58.560> awesome<00:04:58.710> points

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
smart play right awesome awesome points

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.860 
smart play right awesome awesome points
there<00:04:59.400> Joe<00:04:59.610> defeat<00:05:00.000> but<00:05:00.150> if<00:05:00.270> Boston<00:05:00.420> wins<00:05:00.630> in

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
there Joe defeat but if Boston wins in

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.120 
there Joe defeat but if Boston wins in
six<00:05:01.080> that<00:05:01.350> means<00:05:01.560> they're<00:05:01.710> going<00:05:01.830> to<00:05:01.890> close

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
six that means they're going to close

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.310 
six that means they're going to close
out<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:02.490> series<00:05:02.700> on<00:05:03.000> the<00:05:03.210> road<00:05:03.420> in<00:05:03.690> macho<00:05:04.170> we

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
out the series on the road in macho we

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.840 
out the series on the road in macho we
all<00:05:04.440> know<00:05:04.560> how<00:05:04.650> tough<00:05:04.890> of<00:05:05.010> a<00:05:05.130> place<00:05:05.310> Montreal

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
all know how tough of a place Montreal

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.150 
all know how tough of a place Montreal
is<00:05:06.030> to<00:05:06.600> a<00:05:06.630> play<00:05:06.930> and<00:05:07.140> get<00:05:07.380> a<00:05:07.410> winning<00:05:07.830> you<00:05:07.980> think

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
is to a play and get a winning you think

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.590 
is to a play and get a winning you think
that's<00:05:08.370> something<00:05:08.730> that<00:05:08.850> Boston<00:05:09.360> can<00:05:09.510> be

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
that's something that Boston can be

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.010 
that's something that Boston can be
reliably<00:05:10.070> counted<00:05:11.070> on<00:05:11.190> to<00:05:11.220> do<00:05:11.460> yeah<00:05:12.390> it<00:05:12.810> is<00:05:12.990> i

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
reliably counted on to do yeah it is i

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.680 
reliably counted on to do yeah it is i
mean<00:05:13.200> the<00:05:13.590> teams<00:05:13.890> get<00:05:14.160> this<00:05:14.370> this<00:05:14.790> reputation

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
mean the teams get this this reputation

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.600 
mean the teams get this this reputation
going<00:05:16.170> back<00:05:16.350> to<00:05:16.530> certainly<00:05:16.920> the<00:05:17.070> Montreal

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
going back to certainly the Montreal

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.460 
going back to certainly the Montreal
Forum<00:05:17.940> days<00:05:18.210> where<00:05:18.540> Montreal<00:05:18.990> was<00:05:19.170> one<00:05:19.290> of<00:05:19.410> the

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
Forum days where Montreal was one of the

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.230 
Forum days where Montreal was one of the
most<00:05:19.590> dominant<00:05:20.070> teams<00:05:20.160> in<00:05:20.550> the<00:05:20.610> leg<00:05:20.790> but<00:05:20.940> as<00:05:21.090> we

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
most dominant teams in the leg but as we

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.970 
most dominant teams in the leg but as we
said<00:05:21.480> this<00:05:22.050> has<00:05:22.230> been<00:05:22.350> a<00:05:22.410> series<00:05:22.740> where<00:05:22.890> the

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
said this has been a series where the

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.040 
said this has been a series where the
road<00:05:23.130> team<00:05:23.370> has<00:05:23.400> done<00:05:23.640> well<00:05:23.880> and<00:05:24.150> the<00:05:24.600> Boston

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
road team has done well and the Boston

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.720 
road team has done well and the Boston
Bruins<00:05:25.230> well<00:05:25.860> the<00:05:25.980> reason<00:05:26.130> that<00:05:26.340> they've<00:05:26.580> been

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
Bruins well the reason that they've been

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.040 
Bruins well the reason that they've been
winning<00:05:26.850> Stanley<00:05:27.360> Cups<00:05:27.600> is<00:05:27.720> because<00:05:27.900> they

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
winning Stanley Cups is because they

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.870 
winning Stanley Cups is because they
have<00:05:28.200> the<00:05:28.230> ability<00:05:28.710> to<00:05:28.740> win<00:05:28.950> big<00:05:29.190> games<00:05:29.220> on<00:05:29.760> the

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
have the ability to win big games on the

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.000 
have the ability to win big games on the
road<00:05:30.030> so<00:05:30.300> now<00:05:30.450> that's<00:05:30.690> that's<00:05:31.140> not<00:05:31.260> really<00:05:31.830> any

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
road so now that's that's not really any

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.740 
road so now that's that's not really any
big<00:05:32.280> deterrent<00:05:32.610> to<00:05:32.820> me<00:05:33.060> and<00:05:33.270> then<00:05:33.480> one<00:05:33.720> thing

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
big deterrent to me and then one thing

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.030 
big deterrent to me and then one thing
that<00:05:34.020> I'm<00:05:34.110> sure<00:05:34.260> a<00:05:34.290> lot<00:05:34.500> of<00:05:34.560> people<00:05:34.680> are<00:05:34.950> going

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
that I'm sure a lot of people are going

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.130 
that I'm sure a lot of people are going
to<00:05:35.130> be<00:05:35.220> noticing<00:05:35.850> and<00:05:36.000> thinking<00:05:36.360> about<00:05:36.600> which

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
to be noticing and thinking about which

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.480 
to be noticing and thinking about which
you<00:05:37.170> alluded<00:05:37.560> to<00:05:37.680> before<00:05:37.770> is<00:05:38.190> the

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
you alluded to before is the

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.610 
you alluded to before is the
head-to-head<00:05:39.000> record<00:05:39.510> of<00:05:39.690> these<00:05:40.170> two<00:05:40.350> teams

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
head-to-head record of these two teams

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.870 
head-to-head record of these two teams
i'm<00:05:40.830> going<00:05:40.950> to<00:05:41.040> ask<00:05:41.100> your<00:05:41.310> opinion<00:05:41.400> on<00:05:41.700> that

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
how much do you think we can put how

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.320 
how much do you think we can put how
much<00:05:44.400> how<00:05:44.550> important<00:05:44.940> do<00:05:45.000> you<00:05:45.030> think<00:05:45.120> the

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
much how important do you think the

and if i'm not mistaken detroit was

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.590 
and if i'm not mistaken detroit was
another<00:06:14.460> team<00:06:14.730> that<00:06:14.910> he<00:06:15.030> had<00:06:15.150> struggled

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 
another team that he had struggled

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.480 
another team that he had struggled
against<00:06:15.870> a<00:06:16.050> little<00:06:16.290> bit<00:06:16.410> so<00:06:16.650> you<00:06:17.160> know<00:06:17.280> that

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
against a little bit so you know that

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.100 
against a little bit so you know that
didn't<00:06:17.790> turn<00:06:17.940> out<00:06:18.150> all<00:06:18.510> that<00:06:18.690> well<00:06:18.750> for

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
didn't turn out all that well for

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.840 
didn't turn out all that well for
Detroit<00:06:19.470> I<00:06:19.500> know<00:06:19.680> Detroit<00:06:19.980> did<00:06:20.220> win<00:06:20.430> game<00:06:20.460> one

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:20.850 
Detroit I know Detroit did win game one

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.480 
Detroit I know Detroit did win game one
knows<00:06:21.060> I<00:06:21.270> said<00:06:21.510> it<00:06:21.750> is<00:06:21.930> but<00:06:22.410> that's<00:06:22.530> why<00:06:22.830> I<00:06:23.160> do

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
knows I said it is but that's why I do

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.120 
knows I said it is but that's why I do
think<00:06:23.970> it<00:06:24.090> is<00:06:24.180> very<00:06:24.210> key<00:06:24.900> for<00:06:25.200> Montreal<00:06:25.710> to<00:06:25.890> win

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130 
think it is very key for Montreal to win

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.250 
think it is very key for Montreal to win
this<00:06:26.340> series<00:06:26.670> they've<00:06:27.000> got<00:06:27.300> to<00:06:27.510> steal<00:06:27.840> either

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
this series they've got to steal either

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.680 
this series they've got to steal either
game<00:06:28.650> one<00:06:28.920> or<00:06:29.070> Game<00:06:29.250> two<00:06:29.580> you<00:06:30.180> know<00:06:30.300> as<00:06:30.450> much<00:06:30.630> as

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
game one or Game two you know as much as

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.380 
game one or Game two you know as much as
I<00:06:31.050> put<00:06:31.440> a<00:06:31.470> lot<00:06:31.710> of<00:06:31.740> stock<00:06:32.550> in<00:06:32.580> the<00:06:32.880> old<00:06:33.060> saying

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:33.390 
I put a lot of stock in the old saying

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.020 
I put a lot of stock in the old saying
that<00:06:33.750> a<00:06:33.990> series<00:06:34.800> doesn't<00:06:35.010> truly<00:06:35.490> begin<00:06:35.730> until

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.030 
that a series doesn't truly begin until

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.030 
that a series doesn't truly begin until
the<00:06:36.150> road<00:06:36.330> team<00:06:36.600> wins<00:06:36.840> a<00:06:37.020> game<00:06:37.200> and<00:06:37.470> I'm<00:06:37.650> not

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.040 
the road team wins a game and I'm not

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.559 
the road team wins a game and I'm not
one<00:06:38.280> of<00:06:38.310> these<00:06:38.430> people<00:06:38.490> that<00:06:38.820> automatically

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:39.569 
one of these people that automatically

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:41.209 
one of these people that automatically
as<00:06:39.689> if<00:06:40.050> the<00:06:40.199> road<00:06:40.349> team<00:06:40.589> doesn't<00:06:40.919> win<00:06:40.949> one<00:06:41.189> of

00:06:41.209 --> 00:06:41.219 
as if the road team doesn't win one of

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:42.889 
as if the road team doesn't win one of
the<00:06:41.339> first<00:06:41.550> two<00:06:41.729> games<00:06:41.969> that<00:06:42.479> they<00:06:42.629> have<00:06:42.749> no

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:42.899 
the first two games that they have no

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:44.239 
the first two games that they have no
chance<00:06:42.929> at<00:06:43.259> winning<00:06:43.439> the<00:06:43.589> series<00:06:43.830> but<00:06:44.099> I<00:06:44.159> do

00:06:44.239 --> 00:06:44.249 
chance at winning the series but I do

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:46.730 
chance at winning the series but I do
think<00:06:44.580> that<00:06:44.729> for<00:06:45.029> Montreal<00:06:45.899> to<00:06:46.080> maintain<00:06:46.589> the

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 
think that for Montreal to maintain the

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.619 
think that for Montreal to maintain the
one<00:06:46.949> edge<00:06:47.099> that<00:06:47.279> they<00:06:47.399> do<00:06:47.460> have<00:06:47.909> that<00:06:48.449> they've

00:06:48.619 --> 00:06:48.629 
one edge that they do have that they've

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:50.359 
one edge that they do have that they've
done<00:06:48.809> very<00:06:48.869> well<00:06:49.229> in<00:06:49.409> the<00:06:49.559> series<00:06:49.740> they've<00:06:50.099> got

00:06:50.359 --> 00:06:50.369 
done very well in the series they've got

00:06:50.369 --> 00:06:52.489 
done very well in the series they've got
to<00:06:50.550> win<00:06:50.699> Game<00:06:50.969> one<00:06:51.300> or<00:06:51.539> at<00:06:51.659> the<00:06:51.779> very<00:06:51.809> least<00:06:52.110> win

00:06:52.489 --> 00:06:52.499 
to win Game one or at the very least win

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:54.919 
to win Game one or at the very least win
Game<00:06:52.770> two<00:06:53.099> and<00:06:53.369> as<00:06:53.819> I<00:06:53.939> said<00:06:53.999> one<00:06:54.479> of<00:06:54.509> the<00:06:54.689> things

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:54.929 
Game two and as I said one of the things

00:06:54.929 --> 00:06:57.049 
Game two and as I said one of the things
that<00:06:55.050> kind<00:06:55.619> of<00:06:55.679> in<00:06:55.800> Boston's<00:06:56.219> favor<00:06:56.490> maybe<00:06:56.789> not

00:06:57.049 --> 00:06:57.059 
that kind of in Boston's favor maybe not

00:06:57.059 --> 00:06:58.820 
that kind of in Boston's favor maybe not
so<00:06:57.270> much<00:06:57.330> in<00:06:57.599> montreal's<00:06:58.080> favors<00:06:58.559> that<00:06:58.589> the

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830 
so much in montreal's favors that the

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.040 
so much in montreal's favors that the
backup<00:06:59.159> goaltender<00:06:59.369> Budaj<00:06:59.969> is<00:07:00.209> the<00:07:00.749> one<00:07:00.899> who

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050 
backup goaltender Budaj is the one who

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.139 
backup goaltender Budaj is the one who
actually<00:07:01.259> has<00:07:01.679> three<00:07:01.979> wins<00:07:02.309> against<00:07:02.669> Boston

actually has three wins against Boston

00:07:03.149 --> 00:07:05.389 
actually has three wins against Boston
and<00:07:03.270> he's<00:07:03.719> not<00:07:03.899> even<00:07:03.929> going<00:07:04.499> to<00:07:04.529> be<00:07:04.800> in<00:07:05.009> the<00:07:05.219> net

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:05.399 
and he's not even going to be in the net

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:08.570 
and he's not even going to be in the net
so<00:07:05.669> no<00:07:05.999> I<00:07:06.029> never<00:07:06.389> ever<00:07:07.139> ever<00:07:07.409> throw<00:07:08.339> out

00:07:11.359 --> 00:07:11.369 
probably weighed a little heavier than

probably weighed a little heavier than
most<00:07:11.610> handicappers<00:07:12.330> do<00:07:12.539> but<00:07:12.839> still<00:07:13.169> when<00:07:13.740> you
