00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
you know what I'll do the slot machine

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.980 
you know what I'll do the slot machine
this<00:00:26.580> one's<00:00:26.849> kind<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.240> like<00:00:27.359> that's<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.779> little

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
this one's kind of like that's a little

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.460 
this one's kind of like that's a little
different<00:00:28.260> straight<00:00:29.039> out<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.189> like<00:00:29.429> oh<00:00:30.260> okay

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
different straight out of like oh okay

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.770 
different straight out of like oh okay
so<00:00:32.340> first<00:00:32.700> off<00:00:33.000> let's<00:00:33.030> just<00:00:33.480> put<00:00:33.630> all<00:00:33.750> our

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
so first off let's just put all our

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.310 
so first off let's just put all our
money<00:00:34.140> in<00:00:34.320> right<00:00:34.620> there<00:00:34.890> oh<00:00:35.510> this<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.630> on<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.780> six

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.849 
make a quick video okay not that's on
there<00:00:56.250> try<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.239> open<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.230> can<00:00:58.440> see<00:00:58.620> it

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
there try to open this you can see it

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.170 
there try to open this you can see it
slot<00:00:59.160> can't<00:01:00.000> pull<00:01:00.210> down<00:01:00.420> any<00:01:00.510> farther<00:01:02.180> the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
slot can't pull down any farther the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:11.240 
slot can't pull down any farther the
unlocking<00:01:03.899> button<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.420> locked<00:01:10.250> so

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
unlocking button this is locked so

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.179 
unlocking button this is locked so
here's<00:01:12.030> your<00:01:12.240> lever<00:01:12.830> you<00:01:14.509> so<00:01:15.619> you<00:01:16.619> push<00:01:17.009> it

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.460 
here's your lever you so you push it
down<00:01:17.330> let<00:01:18.330> go<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.659> it's<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.200> slot-machine

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
down let go and it it's a slot-machine

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.399 
down let go and it it's a slot-machine
lever<00:01:23.060> so<00:01:24.060> now<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.330> can<00:01:24.659> check<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.080> see<00:01:25.229> if<00:01:25.320> it

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
lever so now you can check to see if it

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:34.460 
lever so now you can check to see if it
unlocked<00:01:26.210> did<00:01:27.210> not<00:01:27.420> still<00:01:28.140> locked<00:01:33.079> up<00:01:34.079> and

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
unlocked did not still locked up and

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.090 
unlocked did not still locked up and
unlock<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.159> time<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:36.210> now<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.479> can<00:01:37.100> slide

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
unlock that time so now you can slide

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.219 
unlock that time so now you can slide
this<00:01:38.340> out<00:01:39.740> and<00:01:40.740> here<00:01:41.490> all<00:01:41.700> your<00:01:41.909> money<00:01:42.229> other

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229

this out and here all your money other
slot<00:01:43.530> machines<00:01:43.860> banks<00:01:44.250> are<00:01:44.369> different<00:01:44.790> but<00:01:45.210> I

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
slot machines banks are different but I

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.530 
slot machines banks are different but I
didn't<00:01:45.720> know<00:01:45.780> how<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.930> make<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.380> other<00:01:46.530> ones

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
didn't know how to make the other ones

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:55.010 
didn't know how to make the other ones
so<00:01:49.100> see<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:52.939> and<00:01:53.939> now<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.299> will<00:01:54.720> show<00:01:54.990> you

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
so see like that and now I will show you

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.900 
so see like that and now I will show you
how<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.590> works

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:07.600 

so<00:02:03.670> here's<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:05.000> mechanism<00:02:05.980> first<00:02:06.980> off<00:02:07.250> I'm

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
so here's the mechanism first off I'm

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.840 
so here's the mechanism first off I'm
just<00:02:07.670> going<00:02:07.940> to<00:02:08.000> show<00:02:08.240> you<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.570> rotor<00:02:08.929> part<00:02:09.910> so

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
just going to show you the rotor part so

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.320 
just going to show you the rotor part so
this<00:02:14.680> thing<00:02:15.680> is<00:02:16.220> connected<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.730> this<00:02:17.000> rotor

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
this thing is connected to this rotor

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.780 
this thing is connected to this rotor
rotor<00:02:18.320> has<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.500> black<00:02:18.770> piece<00:02:19.040> sticking<00:02:19.460> out<00:02:19.610> it

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
rotor has a black piece sticking out it

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.500 
rotor has a black piece sticking out it
black<00:02:20.540> piece<00:02:21.140> is<00:02:21.380> touching<00:02:21.800> this<00:02:21.950> one<00:02:22.270> so<00:02:23.270> when

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
black piece is touching this one so when

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.160 
black piece is touching this one so when
you<00:02:23.630> move<00:02:23.870> this<00:02:24.110> one<00:02:24.380> it'll<00:02:25.070> move<00:02:25.190> that<00:02:25.460> one<00:02:25.700> to

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
you move this one it'll move that one to

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.270 
you move this one it'll move that one to
there<00:02:27.170> you<00:02:27.320> can<00:02:27.440> see<00:02:27.650> you<00:02:27.740> pull<00:02:27.950> this<00:02:28.070> lever

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
there you can see you pull this lever

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:36.850 
there you can see you pull this lever
down<00:02:28.660> spins<00:02:29.660> both<00:02:32.200> okay<00:02:33.670> so<00:02:34.690> now<00:02:35.690> right<00:02:36.590> here

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
down spins both okay so now right here

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.949 
down spins both okay so now right here
is<00:02:37.010> your<00:02:37.130> locking<00:02:37.640> mechanism<00:02:38.330> and<00:02:40.750> hook<00:02:41.750> that

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
is your locking mechanism and hook that

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:50.470 
is your locking mechanism and hook that
there<00:02:46.720> okay<00:02:48.160> so<00:02:49.160> if<00:02:49.280> you<00:02:49.490> look<00:02:49.700> on<00:02:49.880> this<00:02:50.090> rotor

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
there okay so if you look on this rotor

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.890 
there okay so if you look on this rotor
there's<00:02:51.440> one<00:02:51.860> open<00:02:52.280> space<00:02:52.520> has<00:02:53.239> one<00:02:53.570> open

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
there's one open space has one open

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.240 
there's one open space has one open
space<00:02:54.230> and<00:02:56.440> talked<00:02:57.440> about<00:02:57.560> that<00:02:57.980> a<00:02:58.040> little

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
space and talked about that a little

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.940 
space and talked about that a little
more<00:02:58.489> later<00:02:58.750> so<00:02:59.750> on<00:03:00.110> this<00:03:01.750> you<00:03:02.750> can<00:03:02.900> see<00:03:03.260> this

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
more later so on this you can see this

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.040 
more later so on this you can see this
is<00:03:04.190> sticking<00:03:04.640> out<00:03:04.760> a<00:03:04.790> little<00:03:05.209> bit<00:03:05.480> just<00:03:05.510> a<00:03:05.810> tiny

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
is sticking out a little bit just a tiny

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:13.770 
is sticking out a little bit just a tiny
bit<00:03:06.380> enough<00:03:07.130> to<00:03:07.400> lock<00:03:08.180> this<00:03:08.769> or<00:03:09.769> moving<00:03:11.830> okay

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
bit enough to lock this or moving okay

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.690 
bit enough to lock this or moving okay
so<00:03:14.780> do<00:03:15.380> that<00:03:15.590> down<00:03:15.830> I<00:03:15.860> told<00:03:16.310> you<00:03:16.430> before

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
so do that down I told you before

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.420 
so do that down I told you before
there's<00:03:17.299> this<00:03:17.570> one<00:03:17.930> open<00:03:18.440> space<00:03:18.830> right<00:03:19.100> there

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
there's this one open space right there

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.150 
there's this one open space right there
so<00:03:20.239> if<00:03:20.299> you<00:03:20.420> keep<00:03:20.600> on<00:03:20.780> turning<00:03:21.230> it<00:03:21.350> eventually

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
so if you keep on turning it eventually

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.280 
so if you keep on turning it eventually
you'll<00:03:22.670> hit<00:03:22.850> the<00:03:22.910> open<00:03:23.120> space<00:03:23.660> then<00:03:24.140> you<00:03:24.170> can

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
you'll hit the open space then you can

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.120 
you'll hit the open space then you can
pull<00:03:24.709> this<00:03:24.830> down<00:03:25.100> and<00:03:26.170> this<00:03:27.170> will<00:03:27.350> freely<00:03:27.739> come

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
pull this down and this will freely come

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.320 
pull this down and this will freely come
out<00:03:29.410> okay

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
out okay

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.420 
out okay
seems<00:03:32.330> pretty<00:03:32.540> complicated<00:03:32.930> it's<00:03:33.920> actually

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
seems pretty complicated it's actually

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.090 
seems pretty complicated it's actually
not<00:03:34.640> so<00:03:37.660> no<00:03:38.660> tutorial<00:03:39.260> but<00:03:39.440> you<00:03:39.739> can<00:03:39.920> actually

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
not so no tutorial but you can actually

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.300 
not so no tutorial but you can actually
build<00:03:40.430> this<00:03:40.640> yourself<00:03:41.650> this<00:03:42.650> is<00:03:42.860> completely

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
build this yourself this is completely

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.020 
build this yourself this is completely
original<00:03:44.350> I've<00:03:45.350> never<00:03:45.769> seen<00:03:46.130> a<00:03:46.340> lego<00:03:46.610> slot

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
original I've never seen a lego slot

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.840 
original I've never seen a lego slot
machine<00:03:47.360> Bank<00:03:47.630> like<00:03:47.900> this<00:03:47.930> I<00:03:48.470> have<00:03:49.430> seen<00:03:49.700> like

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
machine Bank like this I have seen like

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.180 
machine Bank like this I have seen like
a<00:03:49.970> slot<00:03:50.239> machines<00:03:50.750> but<00:03:51.620> none<00:03:51.799> of<00:03:51.830> them<00:03:52.040> are

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
a slot machines but none of them are

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.190 
a slot machines but none of them are
going<00:03:52.340> to<00:03:52.430> bank<00:03:52.730> that<00:03:53.150> that<00:03:53.570> I've<00:03:53.750> heard<00:03:54.110> of

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
going to bank that that I've heard of

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.860 
going to bank that that I've heard of
and<00:03:54.380> seen<00:03:54.620> in<00:03:55.070> other<00:03:55.220> than<00:03:55.489> and<00:03:55.760> none<00:03:56.690> of<00:03:56.720> the

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
and seen in other than and none of the

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.479 
and seen in other than and none of the
slot<00:03:57.110> machines<00:03:57.440> work<00:03:57.739> like<00:03:57.980> this<00:03:59.709> so<00:04:00.709> that's

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
slot machines work like this so that's

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.940 
slot machines work like this so that's
pretty<00:04:01.730> much<00:04:01.910> it<00:04:02.209> if<00:04:02.690> you<00:04:02.870> use<00:04:03.049> my<00:04:03.230> mechanism

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
pretty much it if you use my mechanism

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.360 
pretty much it if you use my mechanism
make<00:04:04.130> sure<00:04:04.370> to<00:04:04.519> give<00:04:04.730> me<00:04:04.910> credit<00:04:05.180> for<00:04:05.360> it<00:04:06.370> make

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
make sure to give me credit for it make

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.320 
make sure to give me credit for it make
