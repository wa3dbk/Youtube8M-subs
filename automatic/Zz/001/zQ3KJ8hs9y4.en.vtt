00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.930 
session on numerology and we will be
discussing<00:00:04.110> general<00:00:05.009> points<00:00:05.400> now<00:00:05.549> first<00:00:05.790> of

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
discussing general points now first of

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.000 
discussing general points now first of
all<00:00:06.089> important<00:00:06.899> point<00:00:07.140> to<00:00:07.350> understand<00:00:07.830> is

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
all important point to understand is

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.070 
all important point to understand is
that<00:00:08.309> Jim<00:00:08.820> Lodi<00:00:09.090> is<00:00:09.300> totally<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:09.809> do<00:00:09.900> with

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
that Jim Lodi is totally to do with

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.200 
that Jim Lodi is totally to do with
numbers<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:10.769> it<00:00:10.830> is<00:00:10.980> at<00:00:11.160> times<00:00:11.429> considered<00:00:11.849> as

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
numbers and it is at times considered as

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.959 
numbers and it is at times considered as
pseudo<00:00:13.110> mathematics<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:13.980> presently<00:00:14.549> it<00:00:14.670> has

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
pseudo mathematics and presently it has

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.870 
pseudo mathematics and presently it has
been<00:00:15.360> coined<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.289> term<00:00:16.470> pseudoscience<00:00:17.279> so

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
been coined the term pseudoscience so

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.120 
been coined the term pseudoscience so
again<00:00:18.300> it's<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.779> it's<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.800> new<00:00:20.670> branch<00:00:20.970> in<00:00:21.150> itself

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
again it's a it's a new branch in itself

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.859 
again it's a it's a new branch in itself
apart<00:00:23.130> from<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.519> there<00:00:24.150> are<00:00:24.300> three<00:00:24.539> numbers

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
apart from that there are three numbers

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.259 
apart from that there are three numbers
which<00:00:24.900> often<00:00:25.650> leads<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.220> confusions<00:00:27.000> or<00:00:27.150> at

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
which often leads to confusions or at

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.330 
which often leads to confusions or at
times<00:00:27.510> were<00:00:27.660> not<00:00:27.810> very<00:00:27.990> clear<00:00:28.320> with<00:00:28.590> as<00:00:29.070> to

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
times were not very clear with as to

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.759 
times were not very clear with as to
what<00:00:29.490> these<00:00:29.670> numbers<00:00:30.119> can<00:00:30.330> mean<00:00:30.570> let<00:00:31.470> us<00:00:31.500> take

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
what these numbers can mean let us take

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.180 
what these numbers can mean let us take
an<00:00:31.890> example<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.640> psychic<00:00:33.390> number<00:00:33.780> ok<00:00:34.620> psychic

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
an example of psychic number ok psychic

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
number then we have the Destiny number

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.619 
number then we have the Destiny number
okay<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.190> then<00:00:38.670> another<00:00:38.940> important<00:00:39.480> number

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
okay and then another important number

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.490 
okay and then another important number
is<00:00:40.050> your<00:00:40.680> Life<00:00:41.219> Path<00:00:41.489> number<00:00:42.020> now<00:00:43.020> basically

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
what is the difference between all three

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.290 
what is the difference between all three
of<00:00:46.079> them<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.469> an<00:00:46.710> important<00:00:47.190> question<00:00:47.370> now<00:00:48.270> a

Life Path number ok Life Path number is
nothing<00:01:34.380> but<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.619> accumulation<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.460> all<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
nothing but the accumulation of all the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.999 
nothing but the accumulation of all the
numbers<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.450> let<00:01:36.930> us<00:01:36.960> take<00:01:37.200> an<00:01:37.350> example<00:01:37.439> of

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
numbers so let us take an example of

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.210 
numbers so let us take an example of
this<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.610> this<00:01:38.729> will<00:01:38.909> be<00:01:39.030> 5<00:01:39.270> plus<00:01:39.689> 8<00:01:39.960> plus<00:01:39.990> 2<00:01:40.590> so

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
this so this will be 5 plus 8 plus 2 so

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.830 
this so this will be 5 plus 8 plus 2 so
this<00:01:41.369> will<00:01:41.520> make<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.820> 15<00:01:42.240> which<00:01:42.420> will<00:01:42.600> further

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
this will make it 15 which will further

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.139 
this will make it 15 which will further
reduce<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.560> 6<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.340> means<00:01:44.399> Life<00:01:44.850> Path<00:01:45.119> number

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
reduce to 6 that means Life Path number

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.580 
reduce to 6 that means Life Path number
is<00:01:45.659> 6<00:01:46.700> ok<00:01:47.700> now<00:01:48.180> what<00:01:48.390> do<00:01:48.540> we<00:01:48.689> mean<00:01:48.869> by<00:01:48.930> Life<00:01:49.290> Path

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
is 6 ok now what do we mean by Life Path

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.370 
is 6 ok now what do we mean by Life Path
number<00:01:49.619> 6<00:01:50.220> now<00:01:50.850> Life<00:01:51.090> Path<00:01:51.360> number<00:01:51.390> 6<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.170> how

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
number 6 now Life Path number 6 is how

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.649 
number 6 now Life Path number 6 is how
we<00:01:52.439> look<00:01:52.920> at<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.280> life<00:01:53.520> or<00:01:54.180> probably<00:01:54.420> what

your general personality so hence we

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
understood that these three numbers also

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.020 
understood that these three numbers also
will<00:04:11.500> significantly<00:04:12.190> contribute<00:04:12.730> to<00:04:12.910> your

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
personality and they do affect but there

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.129 
personality and they do affect but there
are<00:04:15.340> few<00:04:15.819> variations<00:04:16.299> will<00:04:16.450> be<00:04:16.570> clearing<00:04:16.810> that

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
are few variations will be clearing that

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.170 
are few variations will be clearing that
I<00:04:17.169> in<00:04:17.560> the<00:04:17.799> further<00:04:18.039> videos<00:04:18.459> but<00:04:18.940> for<00:04:18.970> now

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
I in the further videos but for now

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.149 
I in the further videos but for now
hopefully<00:04:19.780> you<00:04:20.049> understood<00:04:20.410> what<00:04:20.590> a<00:04:20.620> psychic

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:21.159 
hopefully you understood what a psychic

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:22.879

life<00:04:21.400> at<00:04:21.669> hand<00:04:21.940> name<00:04:22.090> number

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
life at hand name number

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.279 
life at hand name number
we'll<00:04:23.370> be<00:04:23.520> able<00:04:23.639> to<00:04:23.789> distinguish<00:04:24.419> between<00:04:24.930> the

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
we'll be able to distinguish between the

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.559 
we'll be able to distinguish between the
three<00:04:25.499> and<00:04:26.150> gradually<00:04:27.150> we<00:04:27.210> will<00:04:27.240> go<00:04:27.419> into

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:27.569 
three and gradually we will go into

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:30.020 
three and gradually we will go into
slightly<00:04:28.169> more<00:04:28.349> difficult<00:04:29.129> concepts<00:04:29.849> of

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
slightly more difficult concepts of

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.540 
slightly more difficult concepts of
Soler's<00:04:30.509> number<00:04:30.990> and<00:04:31.259> things<00:04:31.409> like<00:04:31.590> that<00:04:31.650> but

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
Soler's number and things like that but

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.179 
Soler's number and things like that but
for<00:04:32.580> now<00:04:32.909> hopefully<00:04:33.180> about<00:04:33.659> this<00:04:33.870> point<00:04:34.169> so<00:04:34.830> I

00:04:35.179 --> 00:04:35.189 
for now hopefully about this point so I

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:37.219 
for now hopefully about this point so I
am<00:04:35.699> sure<00:04:35.879> tank<00:04:36.090> into<00:04:36.300> Newman<00:04:36.629> logic<00:04:36.870> to<00:04:36.990> check

am sure tank into Newman logic to check

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:38.719 
am sure tank into Newman logic to check
