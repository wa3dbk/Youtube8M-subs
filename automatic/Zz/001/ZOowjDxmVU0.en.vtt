00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
okay see formal overhand loop just

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.410 
okay see formal overhand loop just
before<00:00:42.390> tightening<00:00:42.780> down<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:44.180> always<00:00:45.180> make

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
before tightening down I always make

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.900 
before tightening down I always make
sure<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:46.410> all<00:00:46.620> my<00:00:46.770> duct<00:00:47.010> runs<00:00:47.309> are<00:00:47.489> exactly

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
sure that all my duct runs are exactly

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.610 
sure that all my duct runs are exactly
the<00:00:48.090> same<00:00:48.120> length<00:00:49.670> so<00:00:50.670> using<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:51.149> gauge<00:00:53.600> just

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
the same length so using this gauge just

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.529 
the same length so using this gauge just
tightening<00:00:55.620> down<00:00:55.680> there<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:57.030> makes<00:00:57.329> sure

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
tightening down there that makes sure

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.569 
tightening down there that makes sure
that<00:00:57.570> each<00:00:57.899> duct<00:00:58.260> run<00:00:58.289> gonna<00:00:58.590> make<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.070> exactly

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
that each duct run gonna make is exactly

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.180 
that each duct run gonna make is exactly
the<00:00:59.760> same<00:00:59.969> length<00:01:00.410> just<00:01:01.410> slip<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.859> off<00:01:01.920> and

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
the same length just slip it off and

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.050 
the same length just slip it off and
tighten<00:01:02.489> down<00:01:04.369> okay<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:05.580> turn<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.909> down

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
tighten down okay just turn that down

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.960 
tighten down okay just turn that down
again<00:01:06.360> right<00:01:06.830> now<00:01:07.830> it's<00:01:07.950> taking<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.369> sharp<00:01:08.670> pair

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
again right now it's taking a sharp pair

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:17.140 
again right now it's taking a sharp pair
of<00:01:09.000> scissors<00:01:10.040> leave<00:01:11.040> about<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> 10<00:01:11.700> mil<00:01:11.970> tail

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
run the tag ends of the Dacron just

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.249 
run the tag ends of the Dacron just
through<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.409> blue<00:01:25.710> flame<00:01:26.720> and<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.750> just

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
nips it down it blobs the Dacron which

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.319 
nips it down it blobs the Dacron which
stops<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.579> from<00:01:32.610> fraying<00:01:33.740> okay<00:01:35.180> next<00:01:36.180> take

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329

stops it from fraying okay next take
your<00:01:36.360> baton<00:01:36.840> needle<00:01:37.970> you<00:01:38.970> tail<00:01:39.270> rubber<00:01:39.540> again

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
your baton needle you tail rubber again

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.510 
your baton needle you tail rubber again
these<00:01:40.500> come<00:01:40.829> in<00:01:40.950> green<00:01:40.979> black<00:01:43.130> so<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.250> choice

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
these come in green black so the choice

so you thread the baton needle through

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.510 
so you thread the baton needle through
the<00:01:48.119> rubber<00:01:48.470> then<00:01:49.470> hook<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.799> through<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.310> loop

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
the rubber then hook it through the loop

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.980 
the rubber then hook it through the loop
of<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.759> Dacron<00:01:51.740> very<00:01:52.740> carefully<00:01:53.899> pull<00:01:54.899> the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
of the Dacron very carefully pull the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.469 
of the Dacron very carefully pull the
baiting<00:01:55.409> needle<00:01:55.439> on<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.189> Dacron

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.789 

back<00:02:02.049> through<00:02:02.289> the<00:02:02.380> rubber<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:05.380> then<00:02:05.680> you

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
back through the rubber and then you

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:11.490 
back through the rubber and then you
have<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:07.090> finished<00:02:07.270> Dacron<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.989> solve<00:02:11.290> these
