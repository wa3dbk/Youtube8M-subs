produce<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.869> but<00:02:10.709> they<00:02:10.830> were<00:02:10.860> there<00:02:11.190> their

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
produce and but they were there their

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.309 
produce and but they were there their
design<00:02:11.730> was<00:02:11.940> very<00:02:12.000> controlled

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
design was very controlled

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.949 
design was very controlled
made<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.769> lime<00:02:13.980> wood<00:02:14.340> which<00:02:14.849> is<00:02:14.879> again<00:02:15.719> an

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
made of lime wood which is again an

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.809 
made of lime wood which is again an
interesting<00:02:16.260> point<00:02:16.980> about<00:02:17.099> because<00:02:17.489> you<00:02:17.579> can

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
interesting point about because you can

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.199 
interesting point about because you can
cut<00:02:18.150> bland<00:02:18.450> wood<00:02:18.659> extremely<00:02:19.819> thinly<00:02:20.819> which<00:02:21.120> is

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
cut bland wood extremely thinly which is

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.789 
cut bland wood extremely thinly which is
obviously<00:02:21.510> what<00:02:21.659> you<00:02:21.749> have<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.019> do<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:22.680> they

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
obviously what you have to do so they

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.690 
obviously what you have to do so they
really<00:02:23.069> looked<00:02:23.280> like<00:02:23.430> this<00:02:25.249> during<00:02:26.249> most<00:02:26.549> of

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
really looked like this during most of

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.399 
really looked like this during most of
the<00:02:26.760> Soviet<00:02:27.180> period<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.629> these<00:02:27.749> are<00:02:27.959> Soviet

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
the Soviet period and these are Soviet

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.080 
the Soviet period and these are Soviet
examples<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.129> collected<00:02:29.639> when<00:02:29.879> I<00:02:29.939> was

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
examples that I collected when I was

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.690 
examples that I collected when I was
much<00:02:30.239> younger<00:02:30.299> when<00:02:31.200> perestroika<00:02:32.069> came<00:02:32.310> and

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
much younger when perestroika came and

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.520 
much younger when perestroika came and
glass<00:02:33.000> nest<00:02:33.359> and<00:02:33.659> gold<00:02:33.930> rush<00:02:34.079> off<00:02:34.379> then<00:02:35.099> we<00:02:35.730> had

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
glass nest and gold rush off then we had

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.770 
glass nest and gold rush off then we had
really<00:02:37.530> loss<00:02:38.099> of<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.700> hold<00:02:38.969> over<00:02:39.329> the<00:02:39.419> design

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
really loss of the hold over the design

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.190 
really loss of the hold over the design
and<00:02:40.169> the<00:02:40.980> whole<00:02:41.159> thing<00:02:41.370> exploded<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.269> now

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
and the whole thing exploded and now

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.640 
and the whole thing exploded and now
it's<00:02:43.709> very<00:02:44.069> very<00:02:44.430> common<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:45.090> see<00:02:45.200> kind<00:02:46.200> of<00:02:46.290> the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
it's very very common to see kind of the

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.789 
it's very very common to see kind of the
use<00:02:46.799> of<00:02:46.950> caricature<00:02:47.609> in<00:02:47.879> in<00:02:48.689> the<00:02:48.900> Russian<00:02:49.590> doll

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
this one is called red so about the

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.199 
this one is called red so about the
noise<00:02:53.310> right

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
noise right

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.789 
noise right
the<00:02:54.299> people<00:02:54.689> here<00:02:54.930> are<00:02:55.109> that's<00:02:55.379> good<00:02:55.620> about

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
the people here are that's good about

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.839 
the people here are that's good about
sure<00:02:56.159> this<00:02:57.030> is<00:02:57.239> brioche<00:02:57.719> nerve<00:02:58.049> in<00:02:58.849> a

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
sure this is brioche nerve in a

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.140 
sure this is brioche nerve in a
caricatured<00:03:00.810> way<00:03:01.109> here<00:03:02.099> we<00:03:02.519> have<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:03.090> think

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
caricatured way here we have I think

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.080 
caricatured way here we have I think
this<00:03:03.599> must<00:03:03.840> be<00:03:03.959> Khrushchev<00:03:04.799> it's<00:03:05.669> not<00:03:05.939> as

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
this must be Khrushchev it's not as

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.949 
this must be Khrushchev it's not as
clear<00:03:06.829> this<00:03:07.829> one<00:03:08.129> I<00:03:08.310> think<00:03:08.730> is<00:03:09.060> probably<00:03:09.449> an

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
clear this one I think is probably an

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.530 
clear this one I think is probably an
attempt<00:03:10.439> at<00:03:10.590> Lenin<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.219> the<00:03:11.849> wonderful<00:03:12.209> thing

Russian presidents as well now one of

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:40.610 
Russian presidents as well now one of
the<00:03:37.400> questions<00:03:38.400> that<00:03:38.489> I<00:03:38.579> ask<00:03:38.819> myself<00:03:38.939> is<00:03:39.750> why

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
the questions that I ask myself is why

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.099 
the questions that I ask myself is why
is<00:03:40.680> this<00:03:40.919> such<00:03:41.129> an<00:03:41.280> enduring<00:03:41.549> toy<00:03:42.209> and<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:42.930> think

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
is this such an enduring toy and I think

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.539 
is this such an enduring toy and I think
it's<00:03:43.290> to<00:03:43.769> do<00:03:44.009> with<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:45.180> fact<00:03:45.449> that<00:03:45.569> it<00:03:45.689> being<00:03:45.989> a

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
it's to do with the fact that it being a

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.509 
it's to do with the fact that it being a
combination<00:03:47.549> of<00:03:47.729> something<00:03:48.359> that<00:03:48.810> has

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
combination of something that has

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.369 
combination of something that has
cultural<00:03:50.519> attraction<00:03:51.299> and<00:03:51.479> is<00:03:52.019> also

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
cultural attraction and is also

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.559 
cultural attraction and is also
obviously<00:03:52.680> a<00:03:52.739> toy<00:03:52.979> I<00:03:53.340> think<00:03:53.699> for<00:03:54.030> children<00:03:54.449> the

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
obviously a toy I think for children the

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.670 
obviously a toy I think for children the
doll<00:03:54.829> aspect<00:03:55.829> of<00:03:56.009> it<00:03:56.479> there<00:03:57.479> is<00:03:57.509> in<00:03:57.930> this<00:03:58.229> idea

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
doll aspect of it there is in this idea

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.939 
doll aspect of it there is in this idea
of<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:58.919> nesting<00:03:59.659> the<00:04:00.659> one<00:04:00.840> in<00:04:00.989> the<00:04:01.109> other<00:04:01.229> the

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:01.949 
of the nesting the one in the other the

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:05.599 
of the nesting the one in the other the
the<00:04:02.000> sphinx-like<00:04:03.199> face<00:04:04.199> there<00:04:05.159> is<00:04:05.280> an<00:04:05.400> air<00:04:05.579> of

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
the sphinx-like face there is an air of

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.659 
the sphinx-like face there is an air of
mystery<00:04:06.239> a<00:04:06.599> desire<00:04:07.229> to<00:04:07.259> want<00:04:07.769> to<00:04:07.859> get<00:04:08.129> down<00:04:08.400> to

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
mystery a desire to want to get down to

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:10.849 
mystery a desire to want to get down to
the<00:04:08.790> tiniest<00:04:09.239> figure<00:04:09.870> that<00:04:10.349> is<00:04:10.500> something<00:04:10.799> I

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
the tiniest figure that is something I

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.050 
the tiniest figure that is something I
think<00:04:11.009> which<00:04:11.099> is<00:04:11.129> very<00:04:11.250> true<00:04:11.519> about<00:04:11.609> Russian

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
think which is very true about Russian

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.390 
think which is very true about Russian
life<00:04:12.239> you<00:04:12.539> you<00:04:12.959> scrape<00:04:13.379> off<00:04:13.590> one<00:04:13.889> layer<00:04:14.099> and
