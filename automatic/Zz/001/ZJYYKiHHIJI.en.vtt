00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
good morning everyone this is John and

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.780 
good morning everyone this is John and
today<00:00:02.399> I<00:00:02.790> want<00:00:03.030> to<00:00:03.090> talk<00:00:03.240> a<00:00:03.300> little<00:00:03.629> bit<00:00:03.810> about

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:04.790 
today I want to talk a little bit about

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.039 
today I want to talk a little bit about
caring<00:00:05.790> for<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.120> foliage<00:00:06.390> pads<00:00:06.690> on<00:00:06.899> some

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
caring for the foliage pads on some

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.900 
caring for the foliage pads on some
Pocky<00:00:07.259> juniper<00:00:07.830> this<00:00:07.980> is<00:00:08.130> mainly<00:00:08.460> going<00:00:08.849> to

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
Pocky juniper this is mainly going to

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.100 
Pocky juniper this is mainly going to
consist<00:00:09.389> of<00:00:10.370> working<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:12.179> pruning<00:00:12.870> and

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
consist of working of pruning and

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.060 
consist of working of pruning and
pinching<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:14.639> foliage<00:00:14.969> pad<00:00:15.299> so<00:00:15.800> this<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:16.949> an

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
pinching the foliage pad so this is an

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.130 
pinching the foliage pad so this is an
old<00:00:17.340> shim<00:00:17.760> PACU<00:00:18.180> that<00:00:18.359> I've<00:00:18.510> had<00:00:18.690> for<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:18.990> number

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
old shim PACU that I've had for a number

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.620 
old shim PACU that I've had for a number
of<00:00:19.439> years<00:00:20.300> and<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.720> was<00:00:21.900> displayed<00:00:22.470> I

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
of years and it was displayed I

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.689 
of years and it was displayed I
displayed<00:00:24.630> fall<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:25.050> o8<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.560> spring<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:26.039> o8<00:00:26.340> so

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
displayed fall of o8 and spring of o8 so

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.000 
displayed fall of o8 and spring of o8 so
it<00:00:27.330> had<00:00:27.449> been<00:00:27.570> pinched<00:00:27.990> really<00:00:28.349> hard<00:00:28.590> and

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
it had been pinched really hard and

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.790 
it had been pinched really hard and
wired<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.699> everything<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.240> year<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:30.810> this

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
wired and everything that year so this

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.010 
wired and everything that year so this
past<00:00:32.099> year<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.579> oh<00:00:32.850> nine<00:00:33.059> growing<00:00:33.540> season<00:00:33.930> I

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
past year the oh nine growing season I

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.459 
past year the oh nine growing season I
pretty<00:00:34.230> much<00:00:34.320> just<00:00:34.469> let<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.040> grow<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:36.320> you<00:00:37.320> can

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
pretty much just let it grow and you can

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.110 
pretty much just let it grow and you can
see<00:00:37.649> now<00:00:37.800> it's<00:00:38.040> getting<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.399> real<00:00:38.579> pom-pom

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
see now it's getting the real pom-pom

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.090 
see now it's getting the real pom-pom
look<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.950> things<00:00:40.950> are<00:00:41.190> becoming<00:00:41.730> round<00:00:42.149> and

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
look and things are becoming round and

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.069 
look and things are becoming round and
it's<00:00:44.100> grown<00:00:44.430> well<00:00:44.700> over<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.180> past<00:00:45.420> year<00:00:45.780> but

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
it's grown well over the past year but

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.740 
it's grown well over the past year but
so<00:00:46.590> any<00:00:46.770> outlets<00:00:47.250> look<00:00:47.520> at<00:00:48.300> some<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.690> these

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
so any outlets look at some of these

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.270 
so any outlets look at some of these
techniques<00:00:49.170> there's<00:00:49.800> three<00:00:50.129> basic

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
techniques there's three basic

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.619 
techniques there's three basic
techniques<00:00:50.879> I'm<00:00:51.030> going<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.239> show<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.449> today

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
techniques I'm going to show you today

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:52.970 
techniques I'm going to show you today
I'm<00:00:51.870> going<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.079> show<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.289> how<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.440> use<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> shear

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
I'm going to show you how to use a shear

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.819 
I'm going to show you how to use a shear
your<00:00:53.309> shears<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.539> prune<00:00:54.899> we're<00:00:55.649> going<00:00:55.770> to

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
your shears to to prune we're going to

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.010 
your shears to to prune we're going to
define<00:00:56.129> pinching<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.789> rough<00:00:56.940> pinching<00:00:57.420> let's

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
define pinching and rough pinching let's

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.860 
define pinching and rough pinching let's
begin<00:00:58.379> with<00:00:58.530> using<00:00:58.890> shears<00:00:59.329> and<00:01:00.329> what<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.660> want

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
begin with using shears and what I want

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.750 
begin with using shears and what I want
to<00:01:00.930> point<00:01:01.109> out<00:01:01.320> here<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:02.070> when<00:01:02.609> you're

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
to point out here is that when you're

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.060 
to point out here is that when you're
using<00:01:02.910> shears<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.719> are<00:01:03.870> not<00:01:04.080> shearing<00:01:04.710> you

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
using shears you are not shearing you

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.000 
using shears you are not shearing you
are<00:01:05.280> actually<00:01:06.020> finding<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.290> connecting

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.670 

strands<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.400> foliage<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.570> cutting<00:01:13.470> those

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
strands of foliage and and cutting those

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.410 
strands of foliage and and cutting those
you're<00:01:14.010> not<00:01:14.040> just<00:01:14.520> shearing<00:01:14.909> across<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
you're not just shearing across the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.300 
you're not just shearing across the
bottom<00:01:15.600> even<00:01:16.530> though<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.890> on<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.130> bottom

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
bottom even though it is on the bottom

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.870 
bottom even though it is on the bottom
it's<00:01:17.670> better<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.860> find<00:01:19.860> those<00:01:20.130> individual

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
it's better to find those individual

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.190 
it's better to find those individual
connecting<00:01:21.479> pieces<00:01:22.009> when<00:01:23.009> you're<00:01:23.930> using<00:01:24.930> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
connecting pieces when you're using the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.679 
connecting pieces when you're using the
shears<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.549> hold<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.790> shears<00:01:27.090> almost

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
shears I like to hold the shears almost

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.730 
shears I like to hold the shears almost
level<00:01:27.990> nearly<00:01:28.680> level<00:01:29.100> as<00:01:29.720> I'm<00:01:30.720> approaching<00:01:31.590> in

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
level nearly level as I'm approaching in

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.050 
level nearly level as I'm approaching in
sometimes<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.310> have<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.549> use<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> little<00:01:32.909> bit

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
sometimes you have to use a little bit

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.770 
sometimes you have to use a little bit
of<00:01:33.180> an<00:01:33.270> angle<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:35.150> again<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.299> don't<00:01:36.360> get<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.720> a

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
of an angle and again I don't get in a

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.490 
of an angle and again I don't get in a
hurry<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.110> do<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.500> one<00:01:37.650> piece<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.159> time<00:01:42.500> can

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
hurry I do it one piece of the time can

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.399 
hurry I do it one piece of the time can
see<00:01:43.710> how<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.100> technique<00:01:44.520> works<00:01:45.409> and

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
see how this technique works and

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.469 
see how this technique works and
basically<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.340> flatten<00:01:48.240> out<00:01:48.299> the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
basically this is to flatten out the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.780 
basically this is to flatten out the
bottoms<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:48.990> know<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.200> wanted<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.759> adages<00:01:50.759> and

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
bottoms you know I wanted the adages and

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.850 
bottoms you know I wanted the adages and
bones<00:01:51.119> eyes<00:01:51.299> nothing<00:01:51.659> nothing<00:01:52.409> really<00:01:52.619> grows

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
bones eyes nothing nothing really grows

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.670 
bones eyes nothing nothing really grows
downwards<00:01:53.520> I'm<00:01:53.820> going<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.329> flatten<00:01:55.259> out<00:01:55.500> this

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
downwards I'm going to flatten out this

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.069 
downwards I'm going to flatten out this
bottom<00:01:55.920> I'll<00:01:56.399> use<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.939> rough<00:01:57.479> pinching<00:01:57.930> the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
bottom I'll use the rough pinching the

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.260 
bottom I'll use the rough pinching the
fine<00:01:58.290> pinching<00:01:58.740> for<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.009> tops<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.549> sometimes

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
fine pinching for the tops and sometimes

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.340 
fine pinching for the tops and sometimes
I<00:02:00.450> also<00:02:00.600> use<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.530> will<00:02:02.340> use<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.700> shears<00:02:02.969> on

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
I also use you I will use the shears on

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.219 
I also use you I will use the shears on
on<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.860> top<00:02:05.159> but<00:02:05.579> it's<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:06.270> in<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.990> same

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
on the top but it's it in the same

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.699 
on the top but it's it in the same
technique<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.950> find<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.459> particular<00:02:09.679> piece<00:02:10.679> of

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
technique I find a particular piece of

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.470 
technique I find a particular piece of
foliage<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.489> cut<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:11.910> piece<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.270> foliage

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
foliage and I cut that piece of foliage

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.460 
foliage and I cut that piece of foliage
out<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:13.020> do<00:02:13.080> not

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
out I do not

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.200 
out I do not
just<00:02:13.650> sheer<00:02:13.980> across<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.460> top<00:02:14.640> that's<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:15.000> great

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
just sheer across the top that's a great

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.510 
just sheer across the top that's a great
way<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.660> get<00:02:16.170> round<00:02:16.470> tips<00:02:16.770> all<00:02:17.010> across<00:02:17.340> your

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
way to get round tips all across your

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.100 
way to get round tips all across your
foliage<00:02:17.820> pads<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.450> don't<00:02:18.510> think<00:02:18.780> anybody

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
foliage pads and I don't think anybody

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.190 
foliage pads and I don't think anybody
wants<00:02:19.380> that<00:02:20.030> so<00:02:21.030> all<00:02:21.540> right<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.840> second

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
wants that so all right the second

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.020 
wants that so all right the second
technique<00:02:22.500> is<00:02:22.680> fine<00:02:22.950> pinching<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.730> you'll

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
technique is fine pinching and you'll

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.300 
technique is fine pinching and you'll
notice<00:02:24.360> this<00:02:24.570> is<00:02:24.630> done<00:02:25.050> typically<00:02:25.920> with<00:02:26.130> just

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
notice this is done typically with just

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.280 
notice this is done typically with just
one<00:02:26.460> hand<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.060> it's<00:02:27.270> usually<00:02:27.540> one<00:02:27.930> or<00:02:27.960> two

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
one hand and it's usually one or two

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.720 
one hand and it's usually one or two
little<00:02:28.650> pieces<00:02:28.800> of<00:02:29.070> foliage<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.580> you're

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
little pieces of foliage and you're

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.940 
little pieces of foliage and you're
really<00:02:30.060> not<00:02:30.180> taking<00:02:30.240> off<00:02:30.690> more<00:02:30.930> than<00:02:31.170> maybe<00:02:31.740> an

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
really not taking off more than maybe an

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.580 
really not taking off more than maybe an
eighth<00:02:32.160> or<00:02:32.430> sixteenth<00:02:33.000> of<00:02:33.120> an<00:02:33.270> inch<00:02:33.420> on<00:02:33.690> and

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
eighth or sixteenth of an inch on and

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.310 
eighth or sixteenth of an inch on and
the<00:02:35.310> twisting<00:02:35.940> motion<00:02:36.360> is<00:02:36.540> essential<00:02:37.170> that

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
the twisting motion is essential that

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.910 
the twisting motion is essential that
ends<00:02:37.980> up<00:02:38.040> breaking<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.880> foliage<00:02:39.720> or<00:02:40.620> pulling

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
ends up breaking the foliage or pulling

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.950 
ends up breaking the foliage or pulling
foliage<00:02:41.430> apart<00:02:41.790> where<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.120> where<00:02:42.510> it<00:02:42.600> connects

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
foliage apart where it where it connects

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.820 
foliage apart where it where it connects
and<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.620> won't<00:02:43.860> leave<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.160> ground<00:02:44.520> tip<00:02:45.830> like

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
and it won't leave a ground tip like

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.750 
and it won't leave a ground tip like
rougher<00:02:47.730> pinching<00:02:48.209> or<00:02:48.390> shearing<00:02:48.750> them<00:02:49.760> so

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
rougher pinching or shearing them so

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.300 
rougher pinching or shearing them so
this<00:02:51.420> is<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.810> really<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.230> something<00:02:52.980> that's<00:02:53.160> done

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
this is a really a something that's done

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.220 
this is a really a something that's done
to<00:02:53.370> fine<00:02:53.790> tune<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:54.180> shape<00:02:54.630> of<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.870> foliage

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
to fine tune the shape of the foliage

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.970 
to fine tune the shape of the foliage
pad<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:55.850> can<00:02:56.850> take<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.090> lot<00:02:57.240> of<00:02:57.480> time<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:58.620> really

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
pad and can take a lot of time to really

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.030 
pad and can take a lot of time to really
get<00:02:59.160> them<00:02:59.720> pinched<00:03:00.720> dry<00:03:01.020> alright<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:01.860> third

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
get them pinched dry alright the third

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.580 
get them pinched dry alright the third
technique<00:03:02.310> is<00:03:02.780> rough<00:03:03.780> pinching<00:03:04.320> and<00:03:04.440> you'll

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
technique is rough pinching and you'll

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.670 
technique is rough pinching and you'll
notice<00:03:04.950> here<00:03:05.340> that<00:03:05.570> I'm<00:03:06.570> using<00:03:06.959> two<00:03:07.470> fingers

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
notice here that I'm using two fingers

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.580 
notice here that I'm using two fingers
to<00:03:08.250> hold<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:09.390> foliage<00:03:09.840> that's<00:03:10.140> because<00:03:10.470> I'm

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
to hold the foliage that's because I'm

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.230 
to hold the foliage that's because I'm
trying<00:03:10.800> to<00:03:10.920> get<00:03:11.070> a<00:03:11.100> bunch<00:03:11.340> off<00:03:11.580> at<00:03:11.760> a<00:03:11.820> time<00:03:11.970> not

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
trying to get a bunch off at a time not

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.790 
trying to get a bunch off at a time not
just<00:03:12.270> a<00:03:12.540> little<00:03:12.780> tiny<00:03:12.990> piece<00:03:13.260> like<00:03:13.440> I'm<00:03:13.590> doing

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
just a little tiny piece like I'm doing

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.660 
just a little tiny piece like I'm doing
a<00:03:13.890> fine<00:03:14.130> pinching<00:03:14.550> but<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.060> lot<00:03:15.300> more<00:03:15.600> on<00:03:16.670> so

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
a fine pinching but a lot more on so

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.460 
a fine pinching but a lot more on so
I'll<00:03:17.910> support<00:03:18.390> it<00:03:18.540> with<00:03:18.690> two<00:03:18.840> fingers<00:03:18.870> and

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
I'll support it with two fingers and

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.199 
I'll support it with two fingers and
then<00:03:19.590> I'll<00:03:19.680> use<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.860> other<00:03:20.130> two<00:03:20.370> fingers<00:03:20.610> to

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
then I'll use the other two fingers to

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:29.530 
then I'll use the other two fingers to
pinch<00:03:21.480> it<00:03:21.600> off

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.589 

this<00:03:30.050> is<00:03:30.200> typically<00:03:30.739> done<00:03:31.300> typically<00:03:32.300> done

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
this is typically done typically done

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.410 
this is typically done typically done
more<00:03:32.900> I<00:03:32.959> usually<00:03:33.709> technique<00:03:34.159> more<00:03:34.400> on<00:03:34.670> more

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
more I usually technique more on more

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.330 
more I usually technique more on more
juvenile<00:03:35.950> foliage<00:03:36.950> pads<00:03:37.280> and<00:03:37.730> rough<00:03:38.569> shaping

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
juvenile foliage pads and rough shaping

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.160 
juvenile foliage pads and rough shaping
not<00:03:40.340> so<00:03:40.580> much<00:03:40.760> on<00:03:40.940> fine<00:03:41.239> tree<00:03:41.540> but<00:03:41.780> this<00:03:41.930> tree

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
not so much on fine tree but this tree

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.660 
not so much on fine tree but this tree
had<00:03:42.379> really<00:03:42.620> been<00:03:42.799> allowed<00:03:43.040> to<00:03:43.069> grow<00:03:43.310> a<00:03:43.370> lot

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
had really been allowed to grow a lot

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.420 
had really been allowed to grow a lot
over<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.120> summer<00:03:44.360> and<00:03:44.629> and<00:03:45.530> typically<00:03:46.340> it

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
over the summer and and typically it

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.270 
over the summer and and typically it
wouldn't<00:03:46.700> be<00:03:46.819> in<00:03:46.970> this<00:03:47.090> kind<00:03:47.599> of<00:03:47.720> shape<00:03:47.959> but

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
wouldn't be in this kind of shape but

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.830 
wouldn't be in this kind of shape but
this<00:03:49.280> technique<00:03:49.730> this<00:03:49.879> rough<00:03:50.180> pinching<00:03:50.629> will

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
this technique this rough pinching will

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.930 
this technique this rough pinching will
sometimes<00:03:51.379> leave<00:03:51.769> round<00:03:52.010> tip<00:03:52.310> so<00:03:52.549> you<00:03:52.640> need<00:03:52.849> to

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
sometimes leave round tip so you need to

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:59.229 
sometimes leave round tip so you need to
be<00:03:53.060> careful<00:03:53.269> with<00:03:53.599> it<00:03:57.489> it<00:03:58.489> certainly<00:03:58.819> wouldn't

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
be careful with it it certainly wouldn't

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.300 
be careful with it it certainly wouldn't
be<00:03:59.299> something<00:03:59.569> you'd<00:03:59.810> want<00:03:59.989> to<00:04:00.019> do<00:04:00.200> prior<00:04:00.680> to<00:04:00.709> a

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
be something you'd want to do prior to a

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:09.910 
be something you'd want to do prior to a
show<00:04:02.180> or<00:04:02.540> something<00:04:02.900> like<00:04:03.049> that<00:04:08.530> fine<00:04:09.530> I<00:04:09.560> got

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
show or something like that fine I got

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.470 
show or something like that fine I got
those<00:04:10.099> pieces<00:04:10.400> those<00:04:10.700> pieces<00:04:10.730> were<00:04:11.120> bothering

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
those pieces those pieces were bothering

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.900 
those pieces those pieces were bothering
me<00:04:11.599> it's<00:04:12.590> really<00:04:12.890> interesting<00:04:13.250> and<00:04:13.579> you<00:04:13.640> start

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
me it's really interesting and you start

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.659 
me it's really interesting and you start
looking<00:04:14.120> at<00:04:14.390> bonsai<00:04:14.870> after<00:04:15.500> on<00:04:15.769> you've<00:04:16.400> worked

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
looking at bonsai after on you've worked

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.300 
looking at bonsai after on you've worked
on<00:04:16.820> it<00:04:17.000> you<00:04:17.150> see<00:04:17.389> it<00:04:17.510> in<00:04:17.690> two<00:04:18.049> dimensions<00:04:18.650> I<00:04:18.829> see

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
on it you see it in two dimensions I see

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.729 
on it you see it in two dimensions I see
so<00:04:19.519> many<00:04:19.669> problems<00:04:20.239> here<00:04:20.510> on<00:04:20.690> here's<00:04:21.680> a

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
so many problems here on here's a

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.460 
so many problems here on here's a
problem<00:04:22.039> here's<00:04:22.820> a<00:04:22.910> problem<00:04:23.210> shaped<00:04:24.110> bunny

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
problem here's a problem shaped bunny

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.730 
problem here's a problem shaped bunny
that's<00:04:24.710> actually<00:04:25.400> two<00:04:25.610> branches<00:04:26.180> there<00:04:26.449> on

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
that's actually two branches there on

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.080 
that's actually two branches there on
this<00:04:27.740> one<00:04:27.919> looks<00:04:28.130> pretty<00:04:28.280> good<00:04:28.460> this<00:04:28.910> one

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
this one looks pretty good this one

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.820 
this one looks pretty good this one
looks<00:04:29.270> pretty<00:04:29.360> good<00:04:29.600> this<00:04:30.350> one's<00:04:30.590> still<00:04:30.770> a

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
looks pretty good this one's still a

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.350 
looks pretty good this one's still a
little<00:04:31.010> thick<00:04:31.340> I<00:04:31.520> think<00:04:31.699> the<00:04:31.789> bottom<00:04:32.180> could

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
little thick I think the bottom could

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.140 
little thick I think the bottom could
come<00:04:32.539> off<00:04:32.720> of<00:04:32.870> that<00:04:33.020> a<00:04:33.199> little<00:04:33.590> bit<00:04:33.710> more<00:04:34.150> so

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
come off of that a little bit more so

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.469 
come off of that a little bit more so
even<00:04:35.660> after<00:04:35.840> you've<00:04:36.139> worked<00:04:36.410> on<00:04:36.590> it<00:04:36.770> sometimes

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
even after you've worked on it sometimes

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:39.460 
even after you've worked on it sometimes
you're<00:04:38.479> going<00:04:38.599> to<00:04:38.660> end<00:04:38.810> up<00:04:38.930> saying<00:04:39.080> threw<00:04:39.349> this

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
you're going to end up saying threw this

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.960 
you're going to end up saying threw this
one<00:04:39.530> needs<00:04:39.800> wire<00:04:40.010> but<00:04:40.370> I<00:04:40.430> was<00:04:40.550> actually<00:04:40.729> taking

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
one needs wire but I was actually taking

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.110 
one needs wire but I was actually taking
wire<00:04:41.300> off<00:04:41.510> today<00:04:41.979> not<00:04:42.979> putting<00:04:43.340> it<00:04:43.400> on<00:04:43.520> so<00:04:43.910> this

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
wire off today not putting it on so this

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.719 
wire off today not putting it on so this
one<00:04:44.270> needs<00:04:44.389> to<00:04:44.539> be<00:04:44.630> wired<00:04:44.870> flatter<00:04:45.320> and<00:04:45.729> this

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
one needs to be wired flatter and this

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:50.800 
one needs to be wired flatter and this
one<00:04:46.910> could<00:04:47.060> be<00:04:47.180> wired<00:04:47.360> flatter<00:04:49.599> there's<00:04:50.599> still

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
one could be wired flatter there's still

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.120 
one could be wired flatter there's still
some<00:04:50.960> more<00:04:51.080> pinching<00:04:51.470> that<00:04:51.590> needs<00:04:51.740> to<00:04:51.830> be<00:04:51.919> done

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
some more pinching that needs to be done

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.400 
some more pinching that needs to be done
but<00:04:52.370> in<00:04:52.550> general<00:04:53.060> that's<00:04:53.300> the<00:04:53.419> idea<00:04:53.780> guys<00:04:54.050> I

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
but in general that's the idea guys I

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.620 
but in general that's the idea guys I
