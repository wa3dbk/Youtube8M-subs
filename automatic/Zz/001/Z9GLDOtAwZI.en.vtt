00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.330
 hello everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:17.390
 video today we are going to make a small 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:20.180
 yesterday's doji review 550 good this 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:24.910
 Mobile stands out for its big screen 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:27.910
 5.5 inches and its eight processors to 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.910
 1.7 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.020
 this mobile is the one that I use 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.970
 I am usually very happy with the 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.250
 same 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.990
 I will explain a little bit with him how is 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.990
 outside inside the center 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.540
 from behind to see no no escapes is 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:54.600
 has a hard hard material comparing it 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:57.629
 with galaxy s 5 and 3 in the future 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.300
 has the silver edges are not 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.250
 aluminum because in some review I saw that 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.870
 they said they are aluminum and they are not 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.770
 They are plastic 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:12.079
 the camera the flash that gives enough light 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.119
 as you see, load up landra 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:16.119
 headphones and speakers 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.850
 good 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.260
 let's see let's go into the 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.680
 abductor and I give you the 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:34.770
 more concrete specifications 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.950
 the test I already did so that I did not walk 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.140
 wait good as you can see it has 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.480
 resolution although you can not 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.470
 see well because I'm recording it with a 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:50.880
 mobile a little old in thousand resolution 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.330
 280 x 720 a failure of the mobile and or 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:59.020
 I would put 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:02:04.730
 full hd android version 4.2 point 9 and 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:08.030
 is to install you for the kit kat 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:10.850
 who wants to state that I do not see how 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.970
 people give him some little problems 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.739
 moment did not install anything 13 megapixels 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.830
 of camera the camera is very good 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.230
 very good 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.520
 is camera has an opening of 22 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.900
 millimeters for the terrific camera 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.970
 pincha has been a little bit at night 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.430
 but good mobile phones are not 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.780
 they are professional cameras but the camera 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.720
 it's excellent 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.940
 ran has a turn I think he clicks 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.250
 also that is the giga do not fill it or be 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.830
 you can open games games applications 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.240
 the giga will always reach you could 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.240
 have 2 gigabytes but good 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:57.599
 system memory 1 with 48 gigabyte gb 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:00.860
 it's good and the internal one is 12 gb 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.860
 that is pretty good 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.909
 ok as I said processor 8 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:13.400
 nuclei 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:16.060
 1700 here puts thousand 664 but 2700 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.060
 good 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:24.080
 density 320 p and is pretty good the 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.880
 front camera is 6 with 2 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.750
 megapixels is pretty good for 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.750
 make them selfish 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.880
 the battery is 2,600 megawatts 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.720
 miriam pÃ©rez sorry and good 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.170
 the subject if you have the brightness down the 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.880
 mobile lasts all day 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.890
 if you have the cricket butt 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.890
 you can load it a couple of times 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.760
 good does not support nfc 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.400
 has wifi has address direct from 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:03.570
 sensor has acceleration from a single 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:07.350
 like sensor and compass proximity sensor and 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.340
 nothing good has several cool things 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.460
 to the mobile 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:16.360
 let's see adjustments 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:19.050
 on screen has clear motion for 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.050
 improve fluency 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:25.090
 you still know he has enough things 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:29.220
 right now power sab 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.220
 that is to adjust it for 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.330
 adjust the battery performance and that 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.300
 last longer 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.420
 good or has much the 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.740
 program to turn on and off 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.740
 has an eye 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.580
 and good 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.580
 I can show you the camera if you want or 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.920
 you will not appreciate it either 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.920
 white water does not wait buoy 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.070
 a picture 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:13.740
 from that mobile does not appreciate it I hope 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:16.099
 totally focuses very well to see a 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.099
 video 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.199
 it sounds pretty good 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:29.720
 you can not see the quality with the 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.310
 recording 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.310
 let's see here 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.710
 know more for back 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:42.070
 here you can see how 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:46.129
 as it approached the end and it does not lose almost 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:48.969
 quality is pretty good that is 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:48.969
 it's a pass 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.540
 the photos you can see how good the out 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.500
 pretty good 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.500
 and good 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.929
 it's pretty good 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:07.860
 In general, I recommend the mobile if 

00:06:03.929 --> 00:06:09.470
 120 euros is milk and the brand is 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.840
 reliable 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.880
 and I'm pretty good at saying it's the 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.750
 first mobile that drops me to the ground from 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.400
 a pretty steep height and say 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.360
 that the phone has not suffered a scratch 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.990
 not a goal 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.940
 that is not even a notch surely if I 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:30.750
 it falls again I will be without mobile but 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:33.690
 I mention it and well it's pretty good 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:36.980
 and well I hope you like it like and 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.980
 subscribe thank you
