exploding and dying look at that oh man
they're<00:01:55.490> just<00:01:55.670> all<00:01:55.880> falling<00:01:56.270> from<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.570> sky<00:01:56.810> so

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
they're just all falling from the sky so

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.170 
they're just all falling from the sky so
yeah<00:01:57.410> there's<00:01:57.650> endless<00:01:57.950> possibilities<00:01:58.910> of

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
yeah there's endless possibilities of

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.300 
yeah there's endless possibilities of
stuff<00:01:59.480> to<00:01:59.660> do<00:01:59.780> with<00:01:59.960> this<00:02:00.110> Mach<00:02:00.320> can't

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
stuff to do with this Mach can't

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.490 
stuff to do with this Mach can't
teleport<00:02:01.610> people<00:02:02.180> or<00:02:02.510> yourself<00:02:02.990> or<00:02:03.290> whatever

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
teleport people or yourself or whatever

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.620 
teleport people or yourself or whatever
so<00:02:03.950> let's<00:02:03.980> go<00:02:04.670> ahead<00:02:04.820> and<00:02:05.180> check<00:02:05.390> out<00:02:05.600> some

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
so let's go ahead and check out some

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.840 
so let's go ahead and check out some
places<00:02:06.440> where<00:02:06.860> I<00:02:06.890> think<00:02:07.100> this<00:02:07.520> will<00:02:07.700> be<00:02:07.820> really

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
places where I think this will be really

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.450 
places where I think this will be really
fun<00:02:08.090> to<00:02:08.330> try

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
fun to try

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.060 
fun to try
so<00:02:10.460> the<00:02:10.850> first<00:02:11.180> place<00:02:11.510> I<00:02:11.840> teleport<00:02:12.380> myself<00:02:12.620> to

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
so the first place I teleport myself to

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.140 
so the first place I teleport myself to
is<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.970> airport<00:02:14.450> I<00:02:14.750> kind<00:02:15.260> of<00:02:15.320> want<00:02:15.530> to<00:02:15.560> see<00:02:16.150> how

and then we can go through ourselves and
there's<00:06:42.310> our<00:06:42.490> plane<00:06:42.900> see<00:06:43.900> we<00:06:44.169> freed<00:06:44.470> it<00:06:44.620> it<00:06:45.460> was
