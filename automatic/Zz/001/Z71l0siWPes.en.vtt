00:00:31.709 --> 00:00:31.719 
it works really well I'll probably do a

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:33.959 
it works really well I'll probably do a
review<00:00:32.559> of<00:00:32.710> that<00:00:32.739> a<00:00:32.890> little<00:00:33.280> later<00:00:33.370> on<00:00:33.640> but

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:33.969 
review of that a little later on but

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:54.919 
review of that a little later on but
let's<00:00:34.270> go<00:00:34.450> ahead<00:00:34.570> and<00:00:34.739> get<00:00:35.739> started<00:00:35.920> with<00:00:36.309> this

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:54.929 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:59.639 

now<00:00:56.100> when<00:00:57.100> you<00:00:57.190> open<00:00:57.219> the<00:00:57.640> box<00:00:57.670> you<00:00:58.289> see<00:00:59.289> that

now when you open the box you see that

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.849 
now when you open the box you see that

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:02.859 
it comes with two controllers this

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.330 
it comes with two controllers this
system<00:01:03.460> a<00:01:04.260> charger<00:01:05.260> this<00:01:05.920> is<00:01:06.070> where<00:01:06.220> the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
system a charger this is where the

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.130 
system a charger this is where the
battery<00:01:06.670> was<00:01:06.880> but<00:01:07.240> I've<00:01:07.360> already<00:01:07.540> put<00:01:07.810> that<00:01:07.960> in

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
battery was but I've already put that in

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:17.160 
battery was but I've already put that in
your<00:01:09.870> AV<00:01:10.870> cables<00:01:11.620> and<00:01:12.720> some<00:01:15.150> new<00:01:16.150> buds<00:01:16.420> which

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
your AV cables and some new buds which

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.840 
your AV cables and some new buds which
don't<00:01:17.470> really<00:01:17.710> work<00:01:17.890> that<00:01:18.100> well<00:01:18.310> so<00:01:18.640> I

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
don't really work that well so I

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:33.750 
don't really work that well so I
wouldn't<00:01:19.150> even<00:01:19.210> bother<00:01:19.450> with<00:01:19.750> those<00:01:32.370> okay<00:01:33.370> so

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
wouldn't even bother with those okay so

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:48.650 
wouldn't even bother with those okay so
let's<00:01:34.360> hit<00:01:34.540> the<00:01:34.660> system<00:01:42.930> okay<00:01:44.010> so<00:01:45.010> here<00:01:45.640> it<00:01:45.700> is

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
it feels really sturdy although it does

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.860 
it feels really sturdy although it does

the<00:03:16.280> controllers<00:03:17.280> just<00:03:17.820> so<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.270> system<00:03:19.140> isn't

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
the controllers just so the system isn't

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.030 
the controllers just so the system isn't
shaking<00:03:19.650> around<00:03:19.890> on<00:03:20.340> trying<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.120> make<00:03:21.270> a<00:03:21.300> video

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
shaking around on trying to make a video

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.960 
shaking around on trying to make a video
so<00:03:23.040> let's<00:03:23.550> go<00:03:23.700> ahead<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:23.970> get<00:03:24.270> this<00:03:24.450> started

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
so let's go ahead and get this started

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.080 
so let's go ahead and get this started
now<00:03:26.970> like<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.870> see<00:03:28.080> here<00:03:28.310> this<00:03:29.310> system<00:03:29.790> does

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
now like you see here this system does

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.720 
now like you see here this system does
do<00:03:30.360> that<00:03:30.600> quite<00:03:31.020> a<00:03:31.050> bit<00:03:31.220> you<00:03:32.220> have<00:03:32.370> to<00:03:32.550> keep

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
do that quite a bit you have to keep

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.960 
do that quite a bit you have to keep
taking<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.300> game<00:03:33.480> in<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:33.990> out<00:03:34.140> for<00:03:34.560> it<00:03:34.620> to

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
taking the game in and out for it to

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.200 
taking the game in and out for it to
pick<00:03:35.970> it<00:03:36.090> up<00:03:36.500> but<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:38.250> Super<00:03:38.580> Nintendo<00:03:38.670> did

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
pick it up but the Super Nintendo did

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.540 
pick it up but the Super Nintendo did
that<00:03:39.420> also<00:03:39.930> but<00:03:40.590> this<00:03:40.800> one<00:03:40.980> does<00:03:41.160> it<00:03:41.280> just<00:03:41.460> a

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
that also but this one does it just a

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.350 
that also but this one does it just a
little<00:03:41.580> bit<00:03:41.820> more<00:03:42.090> than<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.390> Super<00:03:42.540> Nintendo

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
little bit more than the Super Nintendo

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:52.760 
little bit more than the Super Nintendo
there<00:03:45.360> we<00:03:45.480> go<00:03:49.280> and<00:03:50.900> this<00:03:51.900> is<00:03:52.050> a<00:03:52.080> very<00:03:52.620> good

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
there we go and this is a very good

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.960 
there we go and this is a very good
speaker<00:03:53.460> it<00:03:53.970> works<00:03:54.180> very<00:03:54.330> well<00:03:55.610> very<00:03:56.610> loud<00:03:56.940> and

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
speaker it works very well very loud and

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.080 
speaker it works very well very loud and
clear<00:03:57.630> a<00:03:57.960> lot<00:03:58.740> of<00:03:58.800> the<00:03:58.950> clone<00:03:59.220> systems<00:03:59.790> the

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
clear a lot of the clone systems the

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.080 
clear a lot of the clone systems the
speakers<00:04:00.480> on<00:04:00.630> those<00:04:00.840> often<00:04:01.320> get<00:04:01.710> all<00:04:02.090> staticy

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
speakers on those often get all staticy

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.360 
speakers on those often get all staticy
and<00:04:03.270> girls<00:04:03.540> if<00:04:03.990> you<00:04:04.170> put<00:04:04.350> them<00:04:04.440> too<00:04:04.590> loud<00:04:04.800> this

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
and girls if you put them too loud this

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:13.820 
and girls if you put them too loud this
works<00:04:05.730> really<00:04:05.850> well<00:04:12.110> so<00:04:13.110> far<00:04:13.140> I<00:04:13.440> haven't

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
works really well so far I haven't

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.289 
works really well so far I haven't
noticed<00:04:14.070> any<00:04:15.000> bugs<00:04:15.420> or<00:04:15.810> anything<00:04:16.350> in<00:04:17.299> the

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
noticed any bugs or anything in the

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.780 
noticed any bugs or anything in the
gameplay<00:04:18.810> or<00:04:19.080> I<00:04:19.470> haven't<00:04:19.920> seen<00:04:20.340> any<00:04:20.520> games

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
gameplay or I haven't seen any games

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:28.450 
gameplay or I haven't seen any games
that<00:04:21.000> don't<00:04:21.150> work<00:04:21.390> with<00:04:21.570> it<00:04:21.690> either<00:04:26.990> so<00:04:27.990> I

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
that don't work with it either so I

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.770 
that don't work with it either so I
would<00:04:29.460> really<00:04:29.700> suggest<00:04:29.940> that<00:04:30.330> you<00:04:30.420> pick<00:04:30.630> one

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
would really suggest that you pick one

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.020 
would really suggest that you pick one
of<00:04:30.900> these<00:04:30.960> up<00:04:31.230> I<00:04:31.500> would<00:04:32.310> probably<00:04:32.520> order<00:04:32.910> it

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
of these up I would probably order it

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.720 
of these up I would probably order it
from<00:04:33.150> Stone<00:04:33.510> Age<00:04:33.720> gamer<00:04:34.050> I'll<00:04:34.770> put<00:04:35.490> a<00:04:35.520> little

Age<00:04:48.600> gamer<00:04:48.900> including<00:04:49.830> shipping<00:04:50.100> maybe<00:04:50.850> a

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
Age gamer including shipping maybe a

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.550 
Age gamer including shipping maybe a
little<00:04:51.180> bit<00:04:51.390> more<00:04:51.540> than<00:04:51.600> that<00:04:51.780> but<00:04:52.140> it's<00:04:52.380> not

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
little bit more than that but it's not

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.740 
little bit more than that but it's not
too<00:04:52.770> bad<00:04:52.800> I<00:04:53.340> mean<00:04:53.940> it<00:04:54.030> isn't<00:04:54.180> super<00:04:54.570> nintendo

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
too bad I mean it isn't super nintendo

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:01.280 
too bad I mean it isn't super nintendo
so<00:04:55.350> it's<00:04:55.980> well<00:04:56.250> worth<00:04:56.490> it<00:04:56.670> and<00:04:59.540> yeah<00:05:00.540> I<00:05:00.570> guess

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
so it's well worth it and yeah I guess

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.970 
so it's well worth it and yeah I guess
that's<00:05:01.560> about<00:05:01.710> it<00:05:02.360> I'll<00:05:03.360> put<00:05:03.810> some<00:05:04.560> more<00:05:04.710> game

videos gameplay vid winds up later it's

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.520
