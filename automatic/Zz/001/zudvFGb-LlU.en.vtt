because<00:00:41.920> it's<00:00:42.070> an<00:00:42.190> eleven<00:00:42.519> sheet<00:00:42.730> inch<00:00:42.969> sheet

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
because it's an eleven sheet inch sheet

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.759 
because it's an eleven sheet inch sheet
of<00:00:43.300> paper<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.870> is<00:00:46.960> going<00:00:47.140> to<00:00:47.230> give<00:00:47.320> us<00:00:47.410> two

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:47.769 
of paper this is going to give us two

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:55.560 
of paper this is going to give us two
cards<00:00:48.460> from<00:00:49.360> one<00:00:49.629> sheet<00:00:49.960> of<00:00:50.019> paper<00:00:50.110> so<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
cards from one sheet of paper so the

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.299 
cards from one sheet of paper so the
procedure<00:00:55.930> is<00:00:56.050> basically<00:00:56.350> the<00:00:56.710> same<00:00:56.920> for<00:00:57.190> all
