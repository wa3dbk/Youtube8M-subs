00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.230
 the desire to fight has never ended 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.120
 because it was clear to him that he was going to 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.430
 I was going to fight as hard as I could 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.039
 to be able to defend my my truth as 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.750
 cyclist yes there was a time when 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.429
 state that as I am sanctioned 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.150
 love for this because I would stop riding in 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.580
 bicycle not 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.930
 the messages from the fans people 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.470
 they are the ones that are at all times 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:38.920
 pushing both this and to train 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.340
 every day my family my wife my 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.340
 friends 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.550
 and at the end of a victory you enjoy it 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.699
 when you know there are people behind you 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.500
 that he enjoys with her if he would not have 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.530
 meaning for me to fight for victory 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.050
 to come back there is a chorus of a future 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.710
 in front of so many victory they 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.710
 hoisted 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.840
 and there is a motto that I have that is to want is 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.369
 power 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.600
 and good the approach to a certain type of 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.600
 things just applied 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:20.140
 one thing that I always have clear - 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.140
 the legs plus I always think that 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.720
 this beach 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.780
 Here I have started completely in the 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:34.130
 legs the arms that hurts having the 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:38.050
 very hard neck is to be focused on that 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.050
 you are going to put up with at home 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.329
 we are up water I think it is already 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.260
 seeing there the station that will be 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.720
 wishing to get 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.760
 everyone has to fight and want 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.620
 get something when you no longer have dreams 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:56.120
 the same will not be motivated not to 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:59.230
 to get out of bed 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.220
 we sing up winning 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.030
 I believe that salaries are 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.460
 very important that they always have to 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.860
 be there 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.459
 what I always say is that you have to 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.459
 fight for them 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.850
 the truth that the motto a bit of the 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.690
 campaign is that shaped what what is 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:28.930
 my reality I think that there could not be 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.440
 been better and could have adjusted more 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.440
 to reality
