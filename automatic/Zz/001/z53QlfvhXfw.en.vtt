00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
wasn't it well even though they've

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.330

seasons and they won their last league
encounter<00:01:12.960> for<00:01:13.409> one<00:01:13.650> it's<00:01:14.460> pretty<00:01:14.670> hard<00:01:14.850> to

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
encounter for one it's pretty hard to

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.160 
encounter for one it's pretty hard to
imagine<00:01:15.090> getting<00:01:15.420> anything<00:01:15.689> at<00:01:15.840> Stamford

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
imagine getting anything at Stamford

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.440 
imagine getting anything at Stamford
Bridge<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.500> time<00:01:16.799> round<00:01:17.009> but<00:01:17.460> then<00:01:18.119> again<00:01:18.240> we

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
Bridge this time round but then again we

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.640 
Bridge this time round but then again we
would<00:01:18.540> have<00:01:18.659> expected<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.080> Blues<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.380> be<00:01:19.470> held

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
would have expected the Blues to be held

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.020 
would have expected the Blues to be held
to<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.799> draw<00:01:19.920> at<00:01:20.009> Swansea<00:01:20.460> last<00:01:20.640> week<00:01:20.820> either

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
to a draw at Swansea last week either

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.700 
to a draw at Swansea last week either
essentially<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:21.930> think<00:01:22.140> if<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.320> likes<00:01:22.530> of

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
essentially I think if the likes of

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.410 
essentially I think if the likes of
Ashley<00:01:22.979> Cole<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.280> Chelsea<00:01:23.549> defense<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.000> Luis

Ashley Cole the Chelsea defense and Luis

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.210

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
Suarez both play like they did last week

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.859 
Suarez both play like they did last week

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
are you pretty badly and pretty well
