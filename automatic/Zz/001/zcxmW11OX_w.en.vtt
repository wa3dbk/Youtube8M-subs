00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.050
 perhaps the title of the first shout possible 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:07.090
 for this was a statement 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.240
 because you have already heard that for weight loss 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.169
 count calories needed 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.199
 so let's see 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:17.140
 the opinion that the amount of calories consumed 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.230
 never mind 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.329
 only leads to failure 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:22.210
 because for weight loss 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.329
 he somehow needs to create 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:26.829
 calorie deficit 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:29.239
 calorie deficiency means that your 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:32.720
 body zhigaev more calories than it gets 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.090
 and you have children 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.040
 and there is nothing difficult 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.729
 if you drive more than practice 

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:41.930
 you choose century 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.730
 if the amount received and 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.250
 consumed energy are equal 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.010
 stored on approximately one field 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.890
 but if you expect more calories than 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.090
 it turns out 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.100
 then you create a calorie deficit 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.570
 who leads weight loss 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.380
 but don't worry i won't convince you 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.720
 need careful counting 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.269
 everything you eat 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.520
 spending on it 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.750
 time flood 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.760
 there are two reasons for this 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.900
 the first 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.900
 you learn that is the right kinds of food 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.420
 their number is correct 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.010
 and at the right time 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.880
 mega the other four keys can 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.970
 but does not want to avoid unwanted 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.390
 products and focus on 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.520
 useful 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.090
 the second reason not to count calories 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.160
 that you learn to listen to your body 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.240
 trusting him choosing the moment when 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.240
 only postpone or redeem side 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.409
 who told you not to give 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.390
 all because of your plate 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.600
 or you do it simply because at 0 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.690
 5 and here 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.520
 eat slowly analyzing your 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.220
 cleansing and stopping th 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.350
 when you feel 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.610
 only then you will not go nasty 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.790
 let and 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.950
 listening to our body trusting him we 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.880
 be sure to succeed 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.249
 use for health 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:12.469
 that your only one question left 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:13.839

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:15.819
