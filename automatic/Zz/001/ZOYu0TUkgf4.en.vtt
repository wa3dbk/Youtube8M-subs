pads<00:01:38.060> of<00:01:38.300> course<00:01:38.510> these<00:01:38.720> are<00:01:38.900> rather

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
pads of course these are rather

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.470 
pads of course these are rather
important<00:01:40.100> because<00:01:40.310> these<00:01:40.700> allowing<00:01:41.150> you<00:01:41.210> to

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
important because these allowing you to

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.400 
important because these allowing you to
use<00:01:42.020> your<00:01:42.380> laptop<00:01:43.750> at<00:01:44.750> least<00:01:44.900> without<00:01:45.170> a<00:01:45.200> mouse

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
use your laptop at least without a mouse

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.290 
use your laptop at least without a mouse
and<00:01:45.680> honestly<00:01:45.980> I<00:01:46.100> think<00:01:46.220> it's<00:01:46.490> preferable<00:01:47.180> to

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
and honestly I think it's preferable to

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.050 
and honestly I think it's preferable to
not<00:01:47.540> use<00:01:47.870> the<00:01:48.140> laptop<00:01:48.320> with<00:01:48.620> Mouse<00:01:48.850> but<00:01:49.850> for

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
not use the laptop with Mouse but for

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.640 
not use the laptop with Mouse but for
this<00:01:50.120> one<00:01:50.360> if<00:01:50.540> you<00:01:50.600> want<00:01:50.750> to<00:01:50.780> do<00:01:50.930> any<00:01:51.080> precision

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
this one if you want to do any precision

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.260 
this one if you want to do any precision
work<00:01:51.860> you'll<00:01:52.190> probably<00:01:52.580> need<00:01:52.970> a<00:01:53.030> mouse

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
work you'll probably need a mouse

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.170 
work you'll probably need a mouse
because<00:01:54.020> this<00:01:54.620> mouse<00:01:54.890> pad<00:01:54.920> is<00:01:55.430> not<00:01:55.880> good<00:01:56.090> at

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
because this mouse pad is not good at

wit can also a battery guide on my
camera<00:02:17.900> alright<00:02:18.470> so<00:02:19.069> here's<00:02:19.459> a<00:02:19.519> typing<00:02:20.060> test

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
camera alright so here's a typing test

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.000 
camera alright so here's a typing test
on<00:02:20.510> this<00:02:20.629> keyboard<00:02:20.840> because<00:02:21.200> I<00:02:21.230> love<00:02:21.620> this

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
on this keyboard because I love this

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.640 
on this keyboard because I love this
keyboard<00:02:22.480> it's<00:02:23.480> chiclet<00:02:24.019> style<00:02:24.050> as<00:02:24.439> you<00:02:24.530> can

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
keyboard it's chiclet style as you can

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.440 
keyboard it's chiclet style as you can
probably<00:02:24.829> see<00:02:25.069> keeps<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.790> dirt<00:02:25.939> out<00:02:26.120> it's

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
probably see keeps the dirt out it's

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.420 
probably see keeps the dirt out it's
efficient<00:02:27.019> clean<00:02:27.620> looking<00:02:27.950> and<00:02:29.620> it's<00:02:30.620> simply

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
efficient clean looking and it's simply

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.459 
efficient clean looking and it's simply
touch<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:31.939> go<00:02:32.090> keys<00:02:32.390> it's<00:02:32.749> very<00:02:32.989> nice<00:02:33.170> scissor

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:33.469 
touch and go keys it's very nice scissor

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:37.239 
touch and go keys it's very nice scissor
style<00:02:33.829> as<00:02:34.310> with<00:02:35.150> most<00:02:35.329> laptops<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:37.040> let<00:02:37.189> me

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:37.249 
style as with most laptops and let me

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:38.819 
style as with most laptops and let me
type<00:02:37.549> something<00:02:37.849> this<00:02:38.120> will<00:02:38.269> probably<00:02:38.480> be

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
type something this will probably be

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.789 
type something this will probably be
disturbingly<00:02:39.829> random<00:02:40.459> so<00:02:41.049> yeah<00:02:42.049> but<00:02:42.769> I

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
disturbingly random so yeah but I

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.649 
disturbingly random so yeah but I
typically<00:02:43.280> type<00:02:43.549> uttered<00:02:43.939> words<00:02:44.420> per<00:02:44.629> minute

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659 
typically type uttered words per minute

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:47.259 
typically type uttered words per minute
on<00:02:45.049> a<00:02:45.079> good<00:02:45.409> keyboard<00:02:45.859> this<00:02:46.310> one<00:02:46.609> I<00:02:46.819> gauge

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
on a good keyboard this one I gauge

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.629 
on a good keyboard this one I gauge
myself<00:02:47.840> at<00:02:48.049> 95<00:02:48.650> words<00:02:48.950> per<00:02:49.129> minute<00:02:49.159> so<00:02:49.489> that's

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:49.639 
myself at 95 words per minute so that's

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:53.020 
myself at 95 words per minute so that's
not<00:02:49.819> bad<00:02:49.969> at<00:02:50.060> all<00:02:50.209> type<00:02:51.049> something<00:02:51.579> the<00:02:52.579> cat
