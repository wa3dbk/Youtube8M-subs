and for this I'm just going to apply

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.219 
and for this I'm just going to apply
them<00:01:12.479> randomly<00:01:13.850> just<00:01:14.850> over<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.420> stamp<00:01:15.930> that

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
them randomly just over the stamp that

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.850 
them randomly just over the stamp that
way<00:01:16.470> like<00:01:16.710> each<00:01:17.659> each<00:01:18.659> leaf<00:01:18.990> has<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.290> different

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
way like each each leaf has a different

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:57.010 
way like each each leaf has a different
color

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.200 

now<00:01:58.020> when<00:01:58.380> doing<00:01:58.740> multiple<00:01:59.340> colors<00:01:59.700> like<00:01:59.969> this

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
now when doing multiple colors like this

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.819 
now when doing multiple colors like this
it's<00:02:00.539> best<00:02:00.840> if<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.229> scrape<00:02:02.840> less<00:02:03.840> like<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.380> as

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
it's best if you scrape less like a as

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.620 
it's best if you scrape less like a as
soon<00:02:05.189> as<00:02:05.310> possible<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.060> way<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.390> colors

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
soon as possible that way the colors

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.330 
soon as possible that way the colors
don't<00:02:07.020> smear<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:09.229> get<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.349> excess<00:02:10.769> let<00:02:11.039> get<00:02:11.190> the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
don't smear I get the excess let get the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.100 
don't smear I get the excess let get the
most<00:02:11.550> off<00:02:11.849> and<00:02:12.150> then<00:02:12.269> if<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.540> have<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.930> go

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
most off and then if you have to go

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.140 
most off and then if you have to go
ahead<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:13.380> scrape<00:02:13.560> again<00:02:13.920> but<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.910> more<00:02:15.090> you

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
ahead and scrape again but the more you

00:02:15.150 --> 00:03:28.090 
ahead and scrape again but the more you
scrape<00:02:15.569> some<00:02:15.810> more<00:02:16.050> blend

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.350 

okay<00:03:29.100> and<00:03:29.310> then<00:03:29.430> for<00:03:29.670> this<00:03:29.790> leaf<00:03:30.000> I'm<00:03:30.180> just

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360
