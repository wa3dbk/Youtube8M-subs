00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.400
 yes was not a nice first time in ahoy 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.810
 Piet experience because I become river 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.160
 you want a positive feeling 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.800
 left to it 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.750
 yes I found it very exciting yes 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.910
 everyone was a bit tense 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.830
 but the atmosphere was really good though 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.570
 300 mascots with it so yes it was 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.029
 fantastic fixed a girl dream that 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.649
 their play and manners of the 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.780
 small final at the grand final that 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.220
 does n't matter to me 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.510
 yes because that tension that saw in it 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.640
 indeed indeed you come there 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.020
 I do think through by a turn 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.190
 wit or you think it's not there 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.280
 thought of it 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.980
 yes sing in particular and we started getting started 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.660
 offers screen so miss many opportunities just 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.270
 defend luc is enough making der 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.400
 gipe process point was actually due to that 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.840
 your whole match must go after 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.460
 bump 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.470
 yes because where should finally 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.060
 happen who had be than who are the 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.950
 players who of you who temporarily like that 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.590
 I'm really going to have the right to that 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.390
 the whole team at our Yes I am 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.820
 that belongs to the entire team of our cupboard 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.520
 that can play very edge and there must 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.380
 being able to stay by can only actually yes yes 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.420
 because no closer than and come closer 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.159
 seems it seems you can out 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.020
 a comedian hooks us through a mess 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.790
 is yours on two points, among other things 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.680
 difference 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.540
 what then goes wrong with you 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.600
 then one cannot persevere and we 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.280
 did not finish the odds 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.250
 we say it is indicated with the 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.659
 ball was whisked away before just had some 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.250
 more because of that 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.530
 and because of that they were able to do holes again 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.500
 and probably ready 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.390
 unfortunately a 4th place for the car is something 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.759
 Marsilio the can get this when we 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.460
 what's really more resident 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.530
 I think we could have done more 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.729
 I still find fantastic performance 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.640
 but I think it's more in that 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.860
 can ct yes certainly okay if you come across it 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.369
 season to look for your own 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.259
 performance b satisfied with or the season 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.149
 yes i am very happy she is first 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.700
 you colic in ahoy that is for 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.990
 myself a very nice achievement and that 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.989
 is that with it also incredibly good 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.250
 done and yes what else last year 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.440
 get out of it 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.420
 because follow a new trainer new 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.830
 chances do you think there are voltaire you 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.799
 that step I could make 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.180
 maybe by the new leadership yes if 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.489
 we are the team we love together 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.780
 just have the many young team so they 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.519
 we can continue to build and with 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.260
 new influences can that if it alone 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.819
 but be positive 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.680
 ok and now enjoy the 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.390
 final you still have favorite for the 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.209
 final 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.070
 I'm going for yes anyway 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.220
