00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.519
 the patient's life is at risk of 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.769
 Immediate medical students 

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:09.900
 They should make a review of their status 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:12.419
 health a valuation and take a 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.370
 decision this skills laboratory 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:16.350
 clinics of the faculty of medicine of 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.710
 the autonomous university of the state of 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.789
 missouri like here in four mannequins 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.890
 computerized that are simulators of 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.599
 patients have all the 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.640
 functions of the human body as the 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.859
 breathing the heart rate the 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.900
 flicker among others 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.900
 this for practical things is a hospital 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.620
 to the students we demand their 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:42.309
 behavior then when they come and 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:46.210
 It makes them a practice as it should 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:49.800
 be the interest is created by going to the 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:54.180
 hospitals to do this that I already did 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:58.320
 place probes place catheters if you saw 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.140
 we have a baby a baby this baby what 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.160
 we can work we can channel 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.080
 your veins 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.030
 Teachers create different scenarios 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.800
 and on the mannequin program some 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.810
 communications for students 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.300
 of medicine put into practice 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.790
 knowledge acquired from the classroom 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.180
 we have programs to see all the 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:22.320
 heart rhythms for example the rhythms 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.979
 respiratory and we have another team 22 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.460
 more teams that are to practice the 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.820
 laparoscopic surgery 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:35.540
 there we teach ourselves to move the tissues to 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.240
 give points to knots and so on and 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.050
 we have some surgeries scheduled there 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.880
 that the student also performs 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.680
 simulation medicine allows the 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.229
 students have a better preparation 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.880
 professional and better performance in 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.780
 carrying out his work with patients 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.979
 inside a hospital it enters that 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.040
 practice let's say with patients already 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.350
 live mannequins or I think it is 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.840
 better do it first with mannequins she 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.610
 because you have that margin of error no longer 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.560
 that with a patient you are playing with your 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.050
 life then that's why it's made to me 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.759
 very practical that kind of activities the 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.310
 clinical skills laboratory 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.630
 the faculty of medicine of the uaem has 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.730
 two years operating and has achieved 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.340
 position itself at the level of institutions 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.200
 public education like the university 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.850
 autonomous national of Mexico and the 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:28.920
 national polytechnic institute 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:32.170
 helper then help us to be able 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.480
 instrument well I do not know how to be like 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.840
 First assistant in some surgery gives you 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.030
 that confidence that you need and the 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.730
 tranquility of the first time being 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.519
 in a surgery since the first semester 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.049
 of the degree of surgeon 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.549
 the students have access to this 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.160
 technology for its preparation 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:54.910
