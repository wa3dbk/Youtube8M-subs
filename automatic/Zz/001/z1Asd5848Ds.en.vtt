for<00:07:09.320> some<00:07:09.470> reason<00:07:09.680> I<00:07:09.710> thought<00:07:09.830> flying<00:07:10.220> was<00:07:10.340> 50%

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:10.580 
for some reason I thought flying was 50%

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:11.530 
for some reason I thought flying was 50%
to<00:07:10.820> flying<00:07:11.030> so<00:07:11.150> that<00:07:11.240> would<00:07:11.330> just<00:07:11.450> be<00:07:11.510> a

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:11.540 
to flying so that would just be a

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.690 
to flying so that would just be a
neutral<00:07:11.840> damage<00:07:12.170> attack<00:07:12.470> but<00:07:12.740> actually<00:07:13.520> since

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:13.700 
neutral damage attack but actually since

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.870 
neutral damage attack but actually since
he's<00:07:13.790> flying<00:07:14.000> fighting<00:07:14.600> I<00:07:15.070> guess<00:07:16.100> flying<00:07:16.760> he's

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:16.880 
he's flying fighting I guess flying he's
