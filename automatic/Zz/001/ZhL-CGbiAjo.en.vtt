00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.090
 ophelia to make you a makeup of 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.980
 night on matte skin since it's me 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.949
 seemed interesting to show others 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.699
 dump shapes of other colors from 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.199
 skin etc 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.670
 so it's more like a night makeup 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.130
 since you see that the student are doing 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.929
 quite loaded there is something quite 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.480
 bright enough not been on the eyes 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:28.429
 I hope you enjoy it and I will 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.749

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.039
 ophelia was done we'll go 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:33.050
 now right now to makeup 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.090
 eyes to start so that the 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.620
 eye shadow 100 I apply a 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.870
 basis therefore all products used 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.280
 will be in info bar I learn it 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.360
 on the fingertips and I applied it 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.360
 on the entire eyelid 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.629
 I then take the eye shadow 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.730
 trendy home elf who counts stones 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.860
 mineral that is really very very pretty 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.320
 and who can be very good 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.760
 days as well as in the evening since 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.100
 it's a seat finally to eyelids that is 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.719
 a little brown iced with 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.559
 golden particles so I would like that 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.460
 this on the entire eyelid 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.460
 also 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.970
 once we've done that I'm just going 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.790
 applied a little bit of makeup to 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.350
 copper eyelids so like these on 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.340
 the bulging of the eyelid to give a 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.470
 little more relief 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.390
 these are very pretty colors 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.910
 on the pots on the matte skins 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.210
 so I applied on the bulging of the 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.210
 eyelid 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.540
 so here you can see that it's 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.850
 something very bright you read me 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.460
 just a black eyeshadow but 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.040
 with a little red glare that is 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.660
 just gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.420
 and I'm going to take a tiny brush 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.120
 pencil to be precise and 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.410
 just apply it in outer corner for 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.410
 accentuate the look 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.270
 and with a brush to your father george 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.510
 nail 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.510
 arms 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.510
 so there is not a big difference 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.640
 for the eyes but it's true 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.650
 that as I applied finally funny this 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.000
 will redraw the look the real 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.220
 change it's going to be the lipstick 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.070
 we're going to put a matte lipstick 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.020
 at mix who is the violet ears 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.220
 who is like these have left 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.810
 absolutely sublime 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.010
 so we will apply it on the tablecloths 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.010
 of water nets by small touches 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.460
 and with that I add a little bios whose 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.460
 the same hue 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.470
 and here is our evening makeup 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.150
 revenues do not support themselves with 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.940
 lipstick but honestly I 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.470
 find that it suits him very well 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.450
 I will apply a layer of mascara 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.770
 on the upper lashes and not too much on the 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.390
 bottom figures so we'll see 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.630
 something of the vigils and we will have 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.630
 completed
