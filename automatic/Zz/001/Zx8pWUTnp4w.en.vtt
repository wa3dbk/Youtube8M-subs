 or industrial zone on the docks of the eni petrochemical deviated 

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:31.339
 industrial plants 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:36.360
 re the future in the future there is a project to let them in 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.090
 de nada lagoon of venice also the maxim gabicce via of run 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.760
 a greater number of large ship passes 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.289
 it means an increase in the swell and the displacement of enormous bodies of water 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.130
 corresponding to the submerged volume of the ships 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.740
 which affect the buildings and the seabed of the whole with disastrous effects 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.220
 San Marco basin is of all canals with age 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.530
 since the industrial zone was built we have

 60 years 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.290
 d water pollution that has deeply compromised 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.160

 only bad going of oil arrived until we say everything from industrial area 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.500
 so for that whole journey half a meter such a million 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.140
 and 300 thousand cubic meters in fact 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.710
 the overall project involves the production of sentences of 6 million and a half

 d metricubes 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.930
 now especially in the summer and we have it

 all the new ones 4 5 6 9 sometimes they come back facebook page i got started 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.250
 in transport with the consequence of 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.659
 and engines for generators set 24 hours a day 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.639
 when rhodes is a combustion 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.819

 Venice is the second city 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.499
 the first if I'm not mistaken because turin for pollution from fine dust 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.949
 recent hatching estimates have calculated that 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.379
 there are on average 1400 ships 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.019
 throughout the year 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.019
 more concentrated towards the periods ie 

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:02.730
 February 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.889
 October 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.929
 and - in the rest of the 

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:08.629
 has been calculated 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:15.389
 that every ship pollutes like 14,000 cars over the 24-hour period 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:21.459
 me on television but maccione carinola - via brigata marche television you say 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.660

 never say never 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.230
 electromagnetic interference is not because she is the radar 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.069
 they produce that
