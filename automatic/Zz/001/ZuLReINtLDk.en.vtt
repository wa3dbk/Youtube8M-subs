00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 the 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:14.650
 and less of the oil vinegar mixture 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.240
 some other salt seasoning the 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.000
 proportions those that we like 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.990
 neither 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.670
 follow the letter to the letter 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.470
 proportions because everyone's life 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.960
 patients are the same not all 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.670
 vinegars are the same and certainly not 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.990
 equal the perception of hidden 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.120
 therefore simply know that the 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.550
 oil will give us a feeling enjoy 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.410
 of the vinegar of that law of adjustments before 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.540
 the weapons do not treat and the rest of the 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.400
 things that you mean with moral are 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.460
 those that you want that allow you to give 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.290
 taste to the football fans or a rod 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.090
 as an action aid with a vinaigrette 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.309
 but I'm going to teach another trick so that 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.050
 you can have at home 45 because they look at 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.329
 greta prepared and that although when 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.200
 come to cook is as simple as 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.200
 open a tomato fight a little 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.200
 Minister 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.110
 a light particles 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.600
 do not 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.600
 explained from black 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:18.219
 a little chive 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.219
 a little bit of pepper in this case 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:21.219
 yellow 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.799
 oil 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.700
 and salt 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.000
 do not 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.000
 root 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.030
 grams 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.560
 and I think we have to do with a 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.039
 mold the rod however fixed that 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.039
 easy 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.110
 and it's also ready for any 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.940
 dish because salad 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.940
 accept the different
