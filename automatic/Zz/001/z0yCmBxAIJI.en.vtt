00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.920
 hello my dear friends trace lp 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.480
 again here and today it continues with 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.820
 another bible from me 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.679
 this time it's about a current gaming 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.800
 setup 2014 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:24.630
 this includes all technical data 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.599
 all current devices I am the pc 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.369
 have joined and yes I should 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:35.070
 do not talk so much it just starts 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:37.260
 after that , it has people right now as well 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.890
 I use my current housing 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.739
 nzxt phantom big tower housing in white 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.050
 blue and I have to say a hammer 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.750
 hornier housing does not exist there 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.090
 visually just awesome on power 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.730
 anyhow something and it just fits 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.710
 Everything purely what you want to have in there 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.199
 There is also an integrated one 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.210
 fan control on the housing on the 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.100
 right side with which he really all 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.470
 Fans that are in the housing 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.960
 You can continue to control with the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:13.860
 drive my current drive is this 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.990
 old but very good dvd drive 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.600
 what used to be always in the old acer pc 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.580
 It was installed by default 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.550
 What more could you want? 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.680
 to get to my room will be 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:33.230
 here ares currently installed the 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:37.670
 skills 16 gb ram ddr3 with 1866 megahertz 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:43.200
 my current mainboard is the area 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:45.180
 technology z68 apd three of my opinion 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.500
 still quite enough there 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.730
 just what I wanted 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.830
 until now everything has taken care of my 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.160
 current processor in my 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:59.550
 computer whispers is the intel core i7 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:01.440
 2600k at 37 gigahertz runs very stable 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.480
 No problems with will soon 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.920
 overclocked to 4 gigahertz though 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.450
 only when the new cooler installed 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.780
 is otherwise quite simply the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.549
 ice mens too hot is currently in 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.969
 my computer is installed 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:16.890
 a 15 terabyte plate from seagate one 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:20.430
 a terabyte western digital 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.020
 and last but not least a 500gb seagate 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.300
 are also still a couple 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.100
 on external hard drives outside my 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.030
 computer to which we logically 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.950
 come later than graphics card installed in 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:38.310
 my calculator is currently the one of mine 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:41.730
 overclocked gtx 780 eco2 with three 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.290
 gigabyte why co2 has asus something completely 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.540
 great created namely a 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.530
 graphics card the three times quieter than the 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.780
 normal 780 ti and 20% cooler running 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.489
 In addition , one must say that the 780 deep 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.560
 from asus just a bomb in gaming 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.239
 is there at the moment just everything up 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.800
 Ultra with this graphics card was free 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.269
 can gamble around battlefield 4 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.500
 even on the map shanghai at the 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.600
 building collapse or other 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.489
 Fog no enemy for this 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.890
 graphics card is going to be a lot 4s im 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.019
 usually loose with 100 ps while minimal 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.120
 In this game, you said 60 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.650
 in my experience also anna three 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.650
 no problem for this video card 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.600
 easy with 70 ps game was okay enough 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.430
 from the graphics card continues and 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.959
 somewhere, all these parts have to be synonymous 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.280
 Finally in current herbekommen the 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.430
 In my case, you get that from the 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.079
 corsa cx 7 150 watt power supply of my 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.810
 opinion for my current setup 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:33.260
 currently sufficient there simply no part 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.959
 from which so much electricity could be consumed 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.100
 so maly forward here you can see one more 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.560
 overview of my computer from 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.630
 inside all cables very nicely hidden 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.290
 Everything clean at this point mean 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.269
 thanks to exco 320 for his help 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.820
 and yes now it goes on with headset 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:53.880

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.340
 mine and I have to say she is 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.500
 incredible 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.230
 you can not go wrong with it 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.640
 is just great 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.260
 yes and how every good gamer must 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.810

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.579
 my fall the logitech g500 g500 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.810
 Do you see that for a while? 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.090
 but I know that 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.769
 very very long and she has been very 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.200
 had to go through a lot of my day 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.820
 despite all this very reliable you can 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.650
 Do not go wrong with great faithfulness 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.390

 I have all my players on it 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.070

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.250
 I just today because I am 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.530
