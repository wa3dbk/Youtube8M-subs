00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
outsides of the press arm what that does

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.000 
outsides of the press arm what that does
is<00:03:00.269> that<00:03:00.510> gives<00:03:00.569> us<00:03:00.930> constant<00:03:01.560> resistance

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
is that gives us constant resistance

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.920 
is that gives us constant resistance
throughout<00:03:02.549> the<00:03:02.790> full<00:03:03.000> range<00:03:03.209> of<00:03:03.359> motion<00:03:03.420> and

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
throughout the full range of motion and

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.009 
throughout the full range of motion and
because<00:03:04.799> of<00:03:04.980> that<00:03:05.099> I<00:03:05.310> get<00:03:05.569> 25%<00:03:06.569> more<00:03:06.690> muscle

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
because of that I get 25% more muscle

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.259 
because of that I get 25% more muscle
contraction<00:03:07.650> but<00:03:08.190> it<00:03:08.340> also<00:03:08.489> allows<00:03:08.849> me<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.180> do

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
contraction but it also allows me to do

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.660 
contraction but it also allows me to do
more<00:03:09.480> exercises<00:03:10.049> so<00:03:10.829> I<00:03:10.890> can<00:03:11.159> press<00:03:11.430> on<00:03:11.579> a

and<00:04:09.480> tricep<00:04:10.019> exercises<00:04:10.609> from<00:04:11.609> there<00:04:11.910> there's

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
and tricep exercises from there there's

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.240 
and tricep exercises from there there's
something<00:04:13.139> else<00:04:13.410> very<00:04:13.500> unique<00:04:14.010> about<00:04:14.129> it

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
something else very unique about it

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.729 
something else very unique about it
inspired<00:04:14.730> gyms<00:04:15.090> is<00:04:15.329> we<00:04:15.840> not<00:04:15.989> only<00:04:16.019> do<00:04:16.440> we<00:04:16.560> give

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
inspired gyms is we not only do we give

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.830 
inspired gyms is we not only do we give
you<00:04:16.859> free<00:04:17.310> weight<00:04:17.579> and<00:04:17.760> functional<00:04:18.209> exercises

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
you free weight and functional exercises

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.599 
you free weight and functional exercises
with<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.019> press<00:04:19.380> arm<00:04:19.620> but<00:04:20.099> we<00:04:20.190> allow<00:04:20.400> you<00:04:20.459> to

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
with the press arm but we allow you to

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.700 
with the press arm but we allow you to
do<00:04:20.699> functional<00:04:21.060> exercises<00:04:21.900> off<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.289> mid<00:04:22.530> and

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
do functional exercises off the mid and

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.010 
do functional exercises off the mid and
low<00:04:23.159> pulley<00:04:23.490> and<00:04:23.760> how<00:04:24.210> we're<00:04:24.390> able<00:04:24.419> to<00:04:24.719> do<00:04:24.870> that

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
low pulley and how we're able to do that

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.839 
low pulley and how we're able to do that
is<00:04:25.200> is<00:04:25.380> we<00:04:25.500> actually<00:04:25.620> cut<00:04:26.010> the<00:04:26.190> resistance<00:04:26.700> in

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:26.849 
is is we actually cut the resistance in

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:27.050 
is is we actually cut the resistance in
half

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
half

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.650 
half
to<00:04:27.389> 50%<00:04:27.930> resistance<00:04:28.680> so<00:04:29.280> if<00:04:29.370> I<00:04:29.460> pin<00:04:29.730> 20<00:04:30.240> pounds

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
to 50% resistance so if I pin 20 pounds

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.750 
to 50% resistance so if I pin 20 pounds
when<00:04:31.139> I'm<00:04:31.260> pulled<00:04:31.590> with<00:04:31.740> this<00:04:31.919> exercise<00:04:32.250> pull

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
when I'm pulled with this exercise pull

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.520 
when I'm pulled with this exercise pull
point<00:04:33.030> I<00:04:33.240> actually<00:04:33.360> have<00:04:33.810> 10<00:04:34.050> pounds<00:04:34.290> of

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
point I actually have 10 pounds of

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.170 
point I actually have 10 pounds of
resistance<00:04:34.680> which<00:04:35.490> allows<00:04:35.790> me<00:04:35.970> to<00:04:36.000> do<00:04:36.150> a

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
resistance which allows me to do a

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.210 
resistance which allows me to do a
variety<00:04:36.419> of<00:04:36.720> different<00:04:36.810> exercises<00:04:37.590> for

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
variety of different exercises for

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.720 
variety of different exercises for
example<00:04:38.280> I<00:04:38.820> can<00:04:39.090> do<00:04:39.210> golf<00:04:39.750> swings<00:04:40.730> baseball

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
example I can do golf swings baseball

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
example I can do golf swings baseball
