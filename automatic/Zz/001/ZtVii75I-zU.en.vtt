00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
actual shiny glittery sticker like all

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.309 
actual shiny glittery sticker like all
the<00:02:37.520> other<00:02:37.700> DX<00:02:38.030> which<00:02:38.270> is<00:02:38.300> so<00:02:38.900> I<00:02:38.930> don't<00:02:39.020> know<00:02:39.230> if

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
the other DX which is so I don't know if

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.080 
the other DX which is so I don't know if
this<00:02:39.440> is<00:02:39.470> intended<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:40.160> it<00:02:40.250> feels<00:02:40.490> a<00:02:40.640> little<00:02:40.760> I

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
this is intended and it feels a little I

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.760 
this is intended and it feels a little I
mean<00:02:41.630> there's<00:02:42.050> not<00:02:42.140> a<00:02:42.200> huge<00:02:42.440> difference

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
mean there's not a huge difference

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.130 
mean there's not a huge difference
between<00:02:42.860> these<00:02:43.190> but<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:44.240> DX<00:02:44.510> ones<00:02:44.720> just<00:02:44.930> feel

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
between these but the DX ones just feel

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.440 
between these but the DX ones just feel
like<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.920> slightly<00:02:46.220> different<00:02:46.490> from<00:02:46.940> from<00:02:47.360> a

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
like the slightly different from from a

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.630 
like the slightly different from from a
standard<00:02:47.870> switch<00:02:48.740> not<00:02:48.920> super<00:02:49.280> different<00:02:49.459> they

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
standard switch not super different they

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.949 
standard switch not super different they
do<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.850> same<00:02:50.030> job<00:02:50.330> but<00:02:50.360> there's<00:02:50.690> just<00:02:50.840> a

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
do the same job but there's just a

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.800 
do the same job but there's just a
little<00:02:51.170> bit<00:02:51.290> more<00:02:51.440> to<00:02:51.620> them<00:02:51.740> and<00:02:52.810> I'm

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
little bit more to them and I'm

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.780 
little bit more to them and I'm
wondering<00:02:54.050> if<00:02:54.230> this<00:02:54.650> if<00:02:54.860> this<00:02:54.980> switch<00:02:55.250> isn't<00:02:55.489> a

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
wondering if this if this switch isn't a

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.910 
wondering if this if this switch isn't a
DX<00:02:56.360> switch<00:02:56.660> like<00:02:56.810> a<00:02:56.840> chase<00:02:57.200> or<00:02:57.470> something<00:02:57.830> in

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
DX switch like a chase or something in

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.860 
DX switch like a chase or something in
there<00:02:58.069> I<00:02:58.100> don't<00:02:58.280> know<00:02:58.580> but<00:02:59.239> it<00:02:59.360> clearly<00:02:59.600> has

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
there I don't know but it clearly has

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.030 
there I don't know but it clearly has
the<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:02.450> glittery<00:03:02.840> DX<00:03:03.260> type<00:03:03.530> sticker<00:03:03.890> that

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
the the glittery DX type sticker that

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.380 
the the glittery DX type sticker that
comes<00:03:04.250> with<00:03:04.430> it

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
comes with it

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.500 
comes with it
so<00:03:05.750> I'm<00:03:05.840> not<00:03:05.930> sure<00:03:05.989> about<00:03:06.290> that<00:03:06.530> but<00:03:07.360> but<00:03:08.360> there

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
so I'm not sure about that but but there

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.710 
so I'm not sure about that but but there
we<00:03:08.600> go<00:03:10.150> powering<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:11.269> up<00:03:11.450> yet

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
we go powering you up yet

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.660 
we go powering you up yet
so<00:03:14.720> yeah<00:03:14.930> just<00:03:15.200> to<00:03:16.040> show<00:03:16.190> off<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.370> difference

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
so yeah just to show off the difference

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.460 
so yeah just to show off the difference
but<00:03:16.850> there's<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.090> hopping<00:03:17.390> switch<00:03:17.630> we'll<00:03:18.380> go

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
but there's the hopping switch we'll go

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.650 
but there's the hopping switch we'll go
ahead<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:18.680> take<00:03:18.920> a<00:03:19.160> while<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.150> show<00:03:20.390> off<00:03:20.510> all

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
ahead and take a while to show off all

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.850 
ahead and take a while to show off all
the<00:03:20.780> sounds<00:03:21.140> we're<00:03:21.350> having<00:03:21.500> to<00:03:21.560> pull<00:03:21.739> these

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
the sounds we're having to pull these

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.880 
the sounds we're having to pull these
out<00:03:22.070> I<00:03:23.080> wanted<00:03:24.080> to<00:03:24.170> wait<00:03:24.320> until<00:03:24.350> I<00:03:24.590> had<00:03:24.769> at

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
out I wanted to wait until I had at

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.320 
out I wanted to wait until I had at
least<00:03:24.980> a<00:03:25.160> full<00:03:25.400> set<00:03:25.610> of<00:03:25.640> switches<00:03:25.970> that<00:03:26.180> could

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
least a full set of switches that could

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.960 
least a full set of switches that could
replace<00:03:26.660> all<00:03:27.170> four<00:03:28.010> of<00:03:28.040> them<00:03:28.250> before<00:03:28.489> I<00:03:28.760> did

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
replace all four of them before I did

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.600 
replace all four of them before I did
another<00:03:29.239> switch<00:03:29.480> review<00:03:30.340> so<00:03:31.340> we'll<00:03:31.489> take

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
another switch review so we'll take

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.580 
another switch review so we'll take
those<00:03:31.760> up<00:03:32.000> we'll<00:03:32.420> go<00:03:32.510> ahead<00:03:32.600> and<00:03:32.810> put<00:03:32.930> in<00:03:33.079> now

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
those up we'll go ahead and put in now

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.910 
those up we'll go ahead and put in now
as<00:03:33.799> of<00:03:33.920> right<00:03:34.070> now<00:03:34.280> there<00:03:34.640> are<00:03:34.820> now<00:03:35.500> four<00:03:38.920> left

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
as of right now there are now four left

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.720 
as of right now there are now four left

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
we're going to see a lot in this last

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.280 
we're going to see a lot in this last

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
main body of the driver so we'll go

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:20.580 
main body of the driver so we'll go
ahead<00:04:11.989> and<00:04:12.140> put<00:04:12.290> magic<00:04:12.590> hand<00:04:12.799> in<00:04:16.720> chainsaw

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.659 

hopping<00:04:23.320> and<00:04:24.320> let's<00:04:25.100> let's<00:04:25.340> go<00:04:25.430> ahead<00:04:25.490> and

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
hopping and let's let's go ahead and

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:31.090 
hopping and let's let's go ahead and
start<00:04:25.880> with<00:04:25.970> camera<00:04:29.320> okay<00:04:30.320> and<00:04:30.530> there's<00:04:30.830> those

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
start with camera okay and there's those

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.070 
start with camera okay and there's those
four<00:04:31.460> switches<00:04:31.729> we'll<00:04:32.270> turn<00:04:32.450> them<00:04:32.539> all<00:04:32.690> on<00:04:32.720> in

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
four switches we'll turn them all on in

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.810 
four switches we'll turn them all on in
succession<00:04:33.650> I'm<00:04:34.070> not<00:04:34.310> going<00:04:34.430> to<00:04:34.490> do<00:04:34.580> all<00:04:34.700> the

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
succession I'm not going to do all the

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.070 
succession I'm not going to do all the
Limit<00:04:35.090> Breaks<00:04:35.300> because<00:04:35.510> it<00:04:35.630> all<00:04:35.720> really<00:04:35.870> long

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
Limit Breaks because it all really long

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.450 
Limit Breaks because it all really long
does<00:04:36.260> is<00:04:36.440> just<00:04:36.620> say<00:04:36.770> the<00:04:36.919> name<00:04:37.010> of<00:04:37.190> the<00:04:37.250> switch

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
does is just say the name of the switch

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.430 
does is just say the name of the switch
again<00:04:37.729> with<00:04:37.910> Limit<00:04:38.270> Break<00:04:38.450> and<00:04:38.660> then<00:04:38.840> make<00:04:39.410> a

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
again with Limit Break and then make a

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.690 
again with Limit Break and then make a
noise<00:04:39.680> none<00:04:39.979> of<00:04:40.070> them<00:04:40.160> make<00:04:40.310> any<00:04:40.490> special

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
noise none of them make any special

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.530 
noise none of them make any special
noises

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
noises

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.800 
noises
so<00:04:41.810> we'll<00:04:42.020> turn<00:04:42.170> on<00:04:42.320> go<00:04:42.800> ahead<00:04:42.890> and<00:04:43.810> activate

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
so we'll turn on go ahead and activate

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:55.870 
so we'll turn on go ahead and activate
the<00:04:46.000> pinch<00:04:47.000> in<00:04:47.210> here<00:04:54.400> you<00:04:55.400> couldn't<00:04:55.610> see<00:04:55.730> that

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
the pinch in here you couldn't see that

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.430 
the pinch in here you couldn't see that
but<00:04:55.970> I<00:04:56.030> was<00:04:56.120> grooving<00:04:56.360> behind<00:04:56.600> the<00:04:56.660> camera<00:04:56.990> now

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
but I was grooving behind the camera now

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:05.290 
but I was grooving behind the camera now
so<00:04:57.470> here's<00:04:57.710> magic<00:04:57.920> hand<00:05:03.730> in<00:05:04.730> here<00:05:05.000> make<00:05:05.180> the

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
so here's magic hand in here make the

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.270 
so here's magic hand in here make the
kind<00:05:05.480> of<00:05:05.540> mechanical<00:05:06.020> arm<00:05:06.170> noise<00:05:06.380> here's<00:05:07.160> the

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
kind of mechanical arm noise here's the

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:14.340 
kind of mechanical arm noise here's the
chainsaw

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:22.210 

here's<00:05:15.350> hopping<00:05:19.780> and<00:05:20.780> here's<00:05:21.770> camera<00:05:22.070> and<00:05:22.190> I

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
here's hopping and here's camera and I

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.670 
here's hopping and here's camera and I
like<00:05:22.370> how<00:05:22.520> Cameras<00:05:23.030> Cameras<00:05:23.450> button<00:05:23.780> it's

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
like how Cameras Cameras button it's

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.140 
like how Cameras Cameras button it's
very<00:05:24.860> similar<00:05:25.070> to<00:05:25.250> an<00:05:25.340> actual<00:05:25.580> camera<00:05:25.910> button

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
very similar to an actual camera button

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.100 
very similar to an actual camera button
I<00:05:26.180> think<00:05:26.210> that's<00:05:26.450> cool<00:05:26.630> how<00:05:26.810> they<00:05:26.930> integrate

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
I think that's cool how they integrate

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.620 
I think that's cool how they integrate
some<00:05:27.470> of<00:05:27.500> these<00:05:27.620> some<00:05:28.070> of<00:05:28.100> the<00:05:28.190> switches<00:05:28.630> which

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
some of these some of the switches which

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:36.670 
some of these some of the switches which
really<00:05:29.870> neat<00:05:30.020> but<00:05:30.200> I<00:05:30.230> use<00:05:35.110> so<00:05:36.110> there's<00:05:36.530> the

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
really neat but I use so there's the

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.290 
really neat but I use so there's the
camera<00:05:36.980> button<00:05:37.160> and<00:05:37.370> then<00:05:37.790> to<00:05:37.910> turn<00:05:38.060> them<00:05:38.210> all

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
camera button and then to turn them all

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.490 
camera button and then to turn them all
off<00:05:38.330> like<00:05:38.540> I<00:05:38.660> said<00:05:38.810> the<00:05:38.870> camera<00:05:39.170> like<00:05:39.320> I<00:05:39.380> said

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
off like I said the camera like I said

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.840 
off like I said the camera like I said
it's<00:05:39.590> like<00:05:39.620> a<00:05:39.740> switch<00:05:39.950> ease<00:05:40.100> pushes<00:05:40.550> on<00:05:40.700> the

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
it's like a switch ease pushes on the

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.850 
it's like a switch ease pushes on the
side<00:05:41.060> that<00:05:41.330> turns<00:05:41.510> it<00:05:41.690> off<00:05:41.810> and<00:05:44.500> there<00:05:45.500> are

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
side that turns it off and there are

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.710 
side that turns it off and there are
those<00:05:46.250> three<00:05:46.580> switches<00:05:46.970> now<00:05:47.480> I'll<00:05:47.600> go<00:05:47.690> ahead

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
those three switches now I'll go ahead

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.790 
those three switches now I'll go ahead
and<00:05:47.930> pull<00:05:48.050> camera<00:05:48.350> out<00:05:48.470> look<00:05:48.620> at<00:05:48.710> parachute

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.960 

now<00:05:54.800> he's<00:05:54.980> already<00:05:55.100> used<00:05:55.400> the<00:05:55.550> parachute

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
now he's already used the parachute

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.720 
now he's already used the parachute
switch<00:05:56.300> very<00:05:56.900> briefly<00:05:57.260> in<00:05:57.440> Episode<00:05:57.800> two<00:05:57.830> after

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:58.730 
switch very briefly in Episode two after

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.390 
switch very briefly in Episode two after
he<00:05:58.850> launched<00:05:59.240> the<00:05:59.590> azoty<00:06:00.590> art<00:06:00.770> up<00:06:00.920> into<00:06:01.100> space

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
he launched the azoty art up into space

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.980 
he launched the azoty art up into space
and<00:06:01.640> launched<00:06:01.880> his<00:06:02.000> bike<00:06:02.180> up<00:06:02.360> after<00:06:02.750> it<00:06:02.870> and

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
and launched his bike up after it and

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.830 
and launched his bike up after it and
then<00:06:03.700> took<00:06:04.700> care<00:06:04.910> of<00:06:04.940> it<00:06:05.060> up<00:06:05.150> in<00:06:05.270> space<00:06:05.570> and<00:06:05.750> as

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
then took care of it up in space and as

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.270 
then took care of it up in space and as
he<00:06:05.930> came<00:06:06.110> down<00:06:06.290> he<00:06:06.440> had<00:06:06.560> the<00:06:06.650> parachutes<00:06:07.100> which

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
he came down he had the parachutes which

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.770 
he came down he had the parachutes which
they<00:06:07.430> haven't<00:06:07.580> really<00:06:07.880> explicitly<00:06:08.510> made<00:06:08.750> a

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
they haven't really explicitly made a

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.940 
they haven't really explicitly made a
big<00:06:08.960> deal<00:06:09.110> of<00:06:09.260> it<00:06:09.350> like<00:06:09.500> they<00:06:09.620> have<00:06:09.770> with

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950 
big deal of it like they have with

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.430 
big deal of it like they have with
hopping<00:06:10.310> and<00:06:10.790> a<00:06:11.390> couple<00:06:11.900> of<00:06:12.020> the<00:06:12.080> other<00:06:12.200> switch

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440 
hopping and a couple of the other switch

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.740 
hopping and a couple of the other switch
and<00:06:12.620> chainsaw<00:06:13.070> but<00:06:13.850> done<00:06:14.000> but<00:06:14.150> he<00:06:14.210> has<00:06:14.390> used<00:06:14.600> it

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
and chainsaw but done but he has used it

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.060 
and chainsaw but done but he has used it
at<00:06:14.870> least<00:06:15.020> once<00:06:15.230> already<00:06:15.410> in<00:06:15.560> the<00:06:15.620> show<00:06:15.830> and

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
at least once already in the show and

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.440 
at least once already in the show and
all<00:06:16.130> you<00:06:16.250> do<00:06:16.370> that<00:06:16.580> you<00:06:16.760> kind<00:06:17.060> of<00:06:17.120> pull<00:06:17.300> the

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:17.450 
all you do that you kind of pull the

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:18.820 
all you do that you kind of pull the
ripcord<00:06:17.630> like<00:06:17.990> you<00:06:18.080> would<00:06:18.200> a<00:06:18.230> parachute<00:06:18.680> on

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
ripcord like you would a parachute on

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:24.940 
ripcord like you would a parachute on
the<00:06:18.920> button<00:06:21.580> stuff<00:06:22.580> like<00:06:22.760> that<00:06:23.770> you<00:06:24.770> get<00:06:24.920> a

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
the button stuff like that you get a

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.390 
the button stuff like that you get a
chain<00:06:25.250> of<00:06:25.880> a<00:06:26.060> parachute<00:06:26.480> opening<00:06:27.280> turn<00:06:28.280> that

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
chain of a parachute opening turn that

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.070 
chain of a parachute opening turn that
off<00:06:28.550> and<00:06:28.730> finally<00:06:30.610> number<00:06:31.610> 11<00:06:32.240> now<00:06:32.540> number<00:06:32.840> 10

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 
off and finally number 11 now number 10

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.380 
off and finally number 11 now number 10
is<00:06:33.350> the<00:06:33.620> electric<00:06:34.010> switch<00:06:34.310> I<00:06:34.520> assume<00:06:35.270> that's

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:35.390 
is the electric switch I assume that's

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.440 
is the electric switch I assume that's
probably<00:06:35.750> going<00:06:35.960> to<00:06:36.050> come<00:06:36.200> with<00:06:36.500> the<00:06:37.450> electric

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:38.450 
probably going to come with the electric

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.230 
probably going to come with the electric
rod<00:06:38.630> roll<00:06:39.200> play<00:06:39.380> toy<00:06:39.730> Billy<00:06:40.730> the<00:06:40.910> rod<00:06:41.090> as

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
rod roll play toy Billy the rod as

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.040 
rod roll play toy Billy the rod as
they're<00:06:41.390> calling<00:06:41.630> it<00:06:43.570> so<00:06:44.570> I'm<00:06:44.720> yeah<00:06:44.990> I'm

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
they're calling it so I'm yeah I'm

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.000 
they're calling it so I'm yeah I'm
assuming<00:06:45.290> that's<00:06:45.410> where<00:06:45.530> we're<00:06:45.620> gonna<00:06:45.680> see<00:06:45.920> it

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.010 
assuming that's where we're gonna see it
