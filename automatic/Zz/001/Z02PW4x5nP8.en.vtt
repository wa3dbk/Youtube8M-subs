00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.419
 and good states to which one comments 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.310
 I bring you the employment of black ops 2 as 

00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:07.479
 you are watching is a gameplay with the 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.920
 scorpion that I do not know what happened to you 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:10.180
 completely the comments there was a 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.680
 lots of people watching that implies a 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.270
 scorpion so good you have it here 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.220
 background is simply because I will come 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.200
 talk about something that surely 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.270
 willis interested many tell me that is 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.830
 you only talk about the xbox and so on 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.060
 I talk about the things that are news 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.680
 not to use a team news 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.810
 just to discard here is vox 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.850
 not but let's say that once past 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.680
 of three and all this found quite 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.520
 information that in fact more surprised 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.020
 because there were things that I was 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.929
 quite wrong that he had 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.129
 commented etcetera on the command and a 

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:38.199
 after playing them there with the 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.819
 etc. I can tell you more or less what 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.280
 is what I thought and apart everything 

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:44.679
 what contains not then good in 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.229
 first place let's say you have like 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:49.359
 five new partners that should be highlighted 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:51.969
 in between I had I do not know how many changes 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:54.010
 but one of the most we will notice is going 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.499
 to be the main thing is that it 's pretty 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.389
 similar let's say you have several changes 

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:00.459
 how are the triggers the light that has 

00:00:58.389 --> 00:01:01.839
 behind the touch screen but what 

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:03.850
 the sticks but what is being 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.010
 let's say the crosshead and like the 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.570
 command of xbox and that have changed it 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.100
 through play and like the 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.100
 buttons are still practically 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.040
 the same and then that on the one hand 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.620
 then you know that he has put the new 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.380
 sticks that you're testing it and I do not know what 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.660
 has given these people the new 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.760
 consoles that both the xbox and the 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.830
 of play 4 are like a tad smaller 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.820
 are ladies I found as pretty 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.350
 different 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.360
 and that we say that the command that I have 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.000
 right now of the xbox with which I play 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.040
 has a play stick 4 sorry a stick 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.340
 of play 3 and other tics of x is not to say 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.020
 one for each thing and yet we 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.650
 we have found to overcome the new 6 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.080
 tics 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.690
 both consoles but it is a change that 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.310
 they say is much better them 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.170
 his super studios that hallucinate and is with 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.300
 the studies that do anybody enters 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.910
 curiosity to talk 20 minutes 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.450
 just from how the tests they do 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:01.000
 for it to happen let's say the test a 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.310
 stick and let's say you can use it and 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.650
 this launches speak to the market so 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.900
 well let's say third 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.250
 would the screen already know you have 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.050
 a screen which is tactile 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.460
 it's just going to serve some games 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.720
 Well, developers who 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:19.060
 maybe to just use the 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.890
 finger out there for some things like 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.020
 example if sachs that worked in the 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.760
 play 3 for some games like spin 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.890
 the doors by let's say that paid with 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.180
 like it is going to not have too many 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.740
 functions in a beginning people 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.630
 let's say that the companies behind can 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.220
 use to develop some games 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.080
 so you will surely see more in a 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.430
 games that are exclusive as per 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.680
 example they use that they like motor 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.890
 use this kind of this kind of thing 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.500
 then also that there are other news that 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.180
 are the light that has just below 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.280
 who did not have the previous command has a 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.750
 light in what is let's say that between 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.650
 quotes looking towards the screen of 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.210
 health so it's also going to be used 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.550
 in some games like for example for 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.380
 tell you the character's health and 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.260
 Something else more than at the moment 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.300
 there are not too many details but it is 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.430
 something that was not there before and now 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.380
 which is now finally good one of 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.300
 the last things is that you have already know 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.710
 that the button to share that 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.210
 you're just going to give it there you can 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.850
 share directly and you can put it 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.010
 with facebook and ustream 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.870
 you already know that the people of xbox have 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.250
 let's say that your things with the people of 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.800
 tweets then I stranger 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.920
 the competition of I imagine then it has it 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.350
 with what I liked the most 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.060
 how it was done has been the triggers if 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.520
 some have seen are triggers that are 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.550
 much shorter ones were very very long in 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.230
 the controls of the play the truth and well 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.459
 too much travel and in this let's say 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.010
 that even has a hitch for 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.380
 up that helps you a lot at the time 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.030
 of executing the fingers to shoot and makes 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.760
 let's say we have a lot of travel 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.530
 shorter and perhaps better in the case of 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.970
 shooters as the weapons of 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.230
 semiautomatic does not have to do the 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.730
 entire travel therefore you can 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.010
 shoot with much more type deficiencies 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.230
 take off many more bullets per minute like this 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.330
 that as I tell you the truth is that I'm 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.489
 quite comfortable with the command I follow what 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.070
 I tried there and it seemed a lot more 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.770
 small than the xbox obviously 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.060
 and less you hulked and I think it has 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.770
 greatly improved on the whole subject of 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.030
 I liked the triggers very much so 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.940
 Well I hope you liked it 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.940
 have served and see you in the next 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.940
 goodbye
