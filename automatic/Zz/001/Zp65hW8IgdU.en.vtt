00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.570 
because it's kind of like a seed the
whole<00:02:54.060> not<00:02:54.360> like<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:54.630> circle<00:02:55.110> it's<00:02:55.320> more<00:02:55.890> of<00:02:56.070> a<00:02:56.220> I

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
whole not like a circle it's more of a I

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.370 
whole not like a circle it's more of a I
don't<00:02:56.910> know<00:02:57.150> I<00:02:57.360> don't<00:02:57.420> know<00:02:57.600> how<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:57.900> explain

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
don't know I don't know how to explain

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.000 
don't know I don't know how to explain
it<00:02:58.500> but<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:59.489> can't<00:02:59.790> move<00:03:00.470> it<00:03:01.470> doesn't<00:03:01.800> have

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
it but you can't move it doesn't have

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.759 
it but you can't move it doesn't have
any<00:03:02.220> points<00:03:02.640> of<00:03:02.760> articulation<00:03:02.870> so<00:03:03.870> that's

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
any points of articulation so that's

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.920 
any points of articulation so that's
pretty<00:03:06.019> pretty<00:03:07.019> bad<00:03:07.320> but<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.580> hope<00:03:09.570> they<00:03:09.750> work

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
pretty pretty bad but I hope they work

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.180 
pretty pretty bad but I hope they work
on<00:03:10.140> that<00:03:10.610> hopefully<00:03:11.610> so<00:03:12.300> I'm<00:03:12.739> moving<00:03:13.739> on<00:03:14.040> to

starting off with pros pros for this
figure<00:04:05.040> um<00:04:05.280> I<00:04:06.180> think<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.630> shade<00:04:06.870> of<00:04:06.900> blue<00:04:07.260> they

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
figure um I think the shade of blue they

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.940 
figure um I think the shade of blue they
used<00:04:07.739> is<00:04:08.040> better<00:04:08.579> than<00:04:08.790> this<00:04:09.630> one<00:04:09.950> although

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
used is better than this one although

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.449 
used is better than this one although
this<00:04:11.400> one<00:04:11.700> has<00:04:12.209> like<00:04:12.870> two<00:04:13.290> different<00:04:13.530> kinds<00:04:14.100> of

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
this one has like two different kinds of

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.190 
this one has like two different kinds of
shades<00:04:14.730> of<00:04:14.910> blue<00:04:15.030> so<00:04:15.269> we<00:04:15.530> this<00:04:16.530> one<00:04:16.590> wait<00:04:17.130> point

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
shades of blue so we this one wait point

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.520 
shades of blue so we this one wait point
but<00:04:19.200> I<00:04:19.229> still<00:04:19.440> like<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.620> dark<00:04:19.950> blue<00:04:20.130> and<00:04:21.530> the

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
but I still like the dark blue and the

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.830 
but I still like the dark blue and the
kind<00:04:23.490> of<00:04:23.580> yellow<00:04:23.849> they<00:04:24.030> used

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
kind of yellow they used

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.800 
kind of yellow they used
in<00:04:25.080> this<00:04:25.560> part<00:04:25.860> here<00:04:26.130> I<00:04:26.370> think<00:04:27.000> pretty<00:04:27.300> cool<00:04:27.600> I

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
in this part here I think pretty cool I

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.909 
in this part here I think pretty cool I
like<00:04:28.290> this<00:04:28.470> color<00:04:28.740> better<00:04:29.070> um<00:04:30.710> that's<00:04:31.710> pretty

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
like this color better um that's pretty

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.640 
like this color better um that's pretty
much<00:04:32.070> it<00:04:32.250> for<00:04:32.310> the<00:04:32.520> pros<00:04:33.229> now<00:04:34.229> moving<00:04:34.470> on<00:04:34.620> to

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
much it for the pros now moving on to

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.430 
much it for the pros now moving on to
the<00:04:34.770> cons<00:04:35.100> just<00:04:35.550> there's<00:04:36.000> a<00:04:36.090> bit<00:04:36.389> of<00:04:36.419> a<00:04:36.750> lot<00:04:37.320> of

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
the cons just there's a bit of a lot of

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.610 
the cons just there's a bit of a lot of
cons<00:04:37.710> so<00:04:38.100> home<00:04:39.030> one<00:04:39.300> con<00:04:39.540> is<00:04:39.870> that<00:04:40.250> the

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
cons so home one con is that the

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.860 
cons so home one con is that the
coloring<00:04:43.620> I<00:04:43.800> mean<00:04:44.160> the<00:04:44.760> color<00:04:45.030> it's<00:04:45.419> not<00:04:45.690> even

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
coloring I mean the color it's not even

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.700 
coloring I mean the color it's not even
silver<00:04:46.410> it's<00:04:46.560> just<00:04:46.919> white<00:04:47.250> and<00:04:47.810> I<00:04:48.810> think<00:04:49.290> they

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
silver it's just white and I think they

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.400 
silver it's just white and I think they
could<00:04:49.889> have<00:04:50.010> made<00:04:50.430> silver<00:04:50.990> colored<00:04:51.990> instead

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
could have made silver colored instead

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.960 
could have made silver colored instead
of<00:04:52.530> white<00:04:52.710> and<00:04:54.500> um<00:04:55.500> another<00:04:56.010> con<00:04:56.340> is<00:04:56.370> that<00:04:56.610> he

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
of white and um another con is that he

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.600 
of white and um another con is that he
can<00:04:57.180> barely<00:04:57.389> stand<00:04:57.479> up<00:04:58.130> it's<00:04:59.130> like<00:04:59.430> kind<00:05:00.210> of

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
can barely stand up it's like kind of

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.129 
can barely stand up it's like kind of
didn't<00:05:02.610> stand<00:05:03.030> up<00:05:03.180> yeah<00:05:03.479> is<00:05:03.690> that<00:05:03.780> the<00:05:03.990> like

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
didn't stand up yeah is that the like

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.500 
didn't stand up yeah is that the like
use<00:05:04.620> both<00:05:04.830> hands<00:05:05.100> and<00:05:05.340> put<00:05:05.940> him<00:05:06.030> on<00:05:06.120> one<00:05:06.300> foot

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
use both hands and put him on one foot

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.620 
use both hands and put him on one foot
like<00:05:06.810> that<00:05:07.400> but<00:05:08.400> yeah<00:05:08.520> um<00:05:09.330> that's<00:05:10.280> another<00:05:11.280> con

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
like that but yeah um that's another con

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.670 
like that but yeah um that's another con
another<00:05:12.630> con<00:05:12.780> is<00:05:13.169> that<00:05:13.260> there's<00:05:13.620> no

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
another con is that there's no

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.850 
another con is that there's no
articulation<00:05:14.310> and<00:05:14.729> if<00:05:15.690> you<00:05:16.229> try<00:05:16.500> to<00:05:16.530> bend

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
articulation and if you try to bend

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.100 
articulation and if you try to bend
deity<00:05:17.280> it<00:05:17.580> will<00:05:17.789> fall<00:05:18.060> out<00:05:18.090> or<00:05:18.450> that<00:05:18.870> we<00:05:18.990> just

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
deity it will fall out or that we just

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.870 
deity it will fall out or that we just
fell<00:05:19.350> out<00:05:19.380> by<00:05:19.620> itself<00:05:19.889> so<00:05:20.250> yeah<00:05:20.460> that's<00:05:20.729> a

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
fell out by itself so yeah that's a

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.180 
fell out by itself so yeah that's a
perfect<00:05:21.300> example<00:05:21.889> for<00:05:22.889> what<00:05:23.280> I<00:05:23.310> mean<00:05:23.550> arm<00:05:25.190> let

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
perfect example for what I mean arm let

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.940 
perfect example for what I mean arm let
me<00:05:26.280> think<00:05:26.400> of<00:05:26.580> another<00:05:26.789> con<00:05:27.120> or<00:05:27.510> if<00:05:28.110> there's<00:05:28.380> no

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
me think of another con or if there's no

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.360 
me think of another con or if there's no
more<00:05:29.160> cons<00:05:29.430> um<00:05:30.770> think<00:05:31.770> that's<00:05:31.979> pretty<00:05:32.130> much<00:05:32.310> it

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
more cons um think that's pretty much it

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.110 
more cons um think that's pretty much it
for<00:05:32.520> the<00:05:32.700> cons<00:05:33.800> so<00:05:34.800> yeah<00:05:35.190> moving<00:05:35.610> on<00:05:35.729> to<00:05:35.760> where

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
for the cons so yeah moving on to where

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.240 
for the cons so yeah moving on to where
you<00:05:36.210> can<00:05:36.389> get<00:05:36.479> your<00:05:36.539> very<00:05:36.810> own<00:05:36.930> i<00:05:37.229> bought<00:05:38.010> mine

this thing there so i picked it up and
yeah<00:05:58.380> that's<00:05:58.979> pretty<00:05:59.099> much<00:05:59.340> where<00:05:59.550> I<00:05:59.580> got<00:05:59.760> it

00:05:59.779 --> 00:05:59.789 
yeah that's pretty much where I got it

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:03.500 
yeah that's pretty much where I got it
from<00:06:00.260> um<00:06:01.490> moving<00:06:02.490> on<00:06:02.580> to<00:06:02.610> the<00:06:02.760> next<00:06:02.940> category

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
from um moving on to the next category

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.190 
from um moving on to the next category
um<00:06:04.220> what<00:06:05.220> i<00:06:05.250> read<00:06:05.550> it<00:06:05.700> i<00:06:05.880> would<00:06:06.570> rate<00:06:06.780> it<00:06:06.840> a

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.200 
um what i read it i would rate it a

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.140 
um what i read it i would rate it a
eight<00:06:08.870> at<00:06:09.870> a<00:06:09.900> ten<00:06:10.470> the<00:06:11.220> reason<00:06:11.520> i<00:06:11.610> read<00:06:11.789> it<00:06:11.910> an<00:06:12.000> 8

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
eight at a ten the reason i read it an 8

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.060 
eight at a ten the reason i read it an 8
out<00:06:12.300> of<00:06:12.330> 10<00:06:12.510> is<00:06:12.780> because<00:06:13.139> there's<00:06:13.950> no

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
out of 10 is because there's no

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.270 
out of 10 is because there's no
articulation<00:06:14.639> and<00:06:15.590> coloring<00:06:16.590> is<00:06:16.800> just<00:06:17.010> blue

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
articulation and coloring is just blue

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.550 
articulation and coloring is just blue
and<00:06:17.639> white<00:06:18.450> and<00:06:18.810> red<00:06:19.800> on<00:06:19.919> the<00:06:20.010> shoes<00:06:20.250> and

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 
and white and red on the shoes and

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.860 
and white and red on the shoes and
yellow<00:06:22.560> but<00:06:22.979> it's<00:06:23.940> just<00:06:24.150> practically<00:06:24.660> the

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
yellow but it's just practically the

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.770 
yellow but it's just practically the
whole<00:06:24.900> thing<00:06:25.229> blue<00:06:25.470> white<00:06:25.710> and<00:06:25.919> i<00:06:26.849> think<00:06:27.660> they

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
whole thing blue white and i think they

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.200 
whole thing blue white and i think they
can<00:06:27.840> work<00:06:28.080> on<00:06:28.260> it<00:06:28.289> a<00:06:28.410> little<00:06:28.440> more<00:06:29.210> hopefully

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
can work on it a little more hopefully

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:35.209 
can work on it a little more hopefully
and<00:06:31.820> i'm<00:06:33.020> hoping<00:06:34.020> i<00:06:34.110> can<00:06:34.169> pick<00:06:34.530> them<00:06:34.680> all<00:06:34.830> up<00:06:34.860> i

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:35.219 
and i'm hoping i can pick them all up i

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:37.060 
and i'm hoping i can pick them all up i
will<00:06:35.610> try<00:06:35.909> to<00:06:35.969> pick<00:06:36.210> them<00:06:36.360> all<00:06:36.479> up

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.070 
will try to pick them all up

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.090 
will try to pick them all up
and<00:06:38.200> that's<00:06:39.200> pretty<00:06:39.380> much<00:06:39.500> it<00:06:39.650> for<00:06:39.830> the

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.100 
and that's pretty much it for the

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.260 
and that's pretty much it for the
categories<00:06:40.730> now<00:06:42.400> moving<00:06:43.400> on<00:06:43.520> anything<00:06:44.090> out<00:06:44.240> of
