of minutes made a save he was all over

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:07.160 
of minutes made a save he was all over
the<00:02:05.399> ice<00:02:05.580> and<00:02:05.970> no<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.390> crowd<00:02:06.599> was<00:02:06.810> loving<00:02:07.110> it

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
and that was probably my happiest moment

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.249 
and that was probably my happiest moment
at<00:02:08.849> UMass<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.420> seeing<00:02:09.660> because<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:09.899> was<00:02:10.050> really

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
at UMass is seeing because I was really

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.020

the<00:02:12.120> lineup<00:02:12.480> was<00:02:12.629> great<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.050> I'm<00:02:13.410> really

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
the lineup was great and I'm really

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.740 
the lineup was great and I'm really
looking<00:02:13.860> forward<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:14.190> more<00:02:15.120> Z<00:02:15.300> getting<00:02:15.629> his

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
looking forward to more Z getting his

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.059 
looking forward to more Z getting his
first<00:02:15.930> game<00:02:16.200> this<00:02:16.410> year<00:02:16.470> that's<00:02:16.770> going<00:02:17.010> to

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
first game this year that's going to

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.530 
first game this year that's going to
that<00:02:17.459> might<00:02:17.610> top<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:17.970> because<00:02:18.180> more<00:02:18.360> she's

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
that might top it because more she's

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.729 
that might top it because more she's
been<00:02:18.690> working<00:02:19.080> hard<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.349> I've<00:02:19.440> been<00:02:19.560> with<00:02:19.650> him
