00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.259
 Good afternoon, I'm here today to 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:08.570
 to introduce my presentation is not to do 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:12.170
 another video about lx 1 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:15.650
 you must have seen something in 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.170
 internet on it is already must have 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.670
 I searched for something I bought my 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.940

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.350
 I bought mine should have a week one 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.100

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.680
 appliance 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.869
 He is very violent and very violent. 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.119
 above what people can imagine 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.940
 of one of a house sound 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.999
 He's got all this stuff here. 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.420
 the 15 inch tv speakers 

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:45.069
 left to put a song here that 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:48.530
 Gives the oligarchy the LEDs 

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:50.749
 he has this gilad talking note game 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.989
 that he is optional yours 

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:56.030
 he has enough and enough information 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.639
 for you to place here combinations of 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.280
 light for him to play and also has the 

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:03.409
 option of leaving you all erased but 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.360
 I prefer it more beautiful accessory of the 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.360
 See you soon in there. 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.149
 As another video said, I still do not know if 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.990
 this is a bugle not yet 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:18.109
 managed information truly a 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.219
 bugle if you have it if you only knew it 

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:22.369
 or not a bugle 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:23.750
 If you have to say, I'll stay. 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.829
 thankful because I really wanted to know 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.490
 if the horn is really here and so on 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:29.990
 is 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.289
 I came here today to put some 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.350
 songs to play on is me yet 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.729
 I only arrived until 30 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.009
 I already managed to reach 30, not yet. 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.320
 I put it at maximum volume even 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.579
 because it has no structure that at home is 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.049
 dangerous, I do not know 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:48.710
 I have already been told that he is very violent and 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:54.890
 explode window and I had no option of 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:59.569
 put here at most off that the 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:02.749
 superbad function the bazooka effect 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:06.560
 him I'm off with him 

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:09.010
 I'm going to put a song that is kind of 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.260
 old but it's more because of the serious 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:13.120
 I'll put first kombis blast 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.110
 off 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:21.730
 then I put it on blast activated 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:27.250
 for you to see the difference and botafogo 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:32.340
 20 where it was said and brought is the first 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.340
 The point of the word here is just kisses 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.850
 ae 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:04.220
 the Lady 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.220
 who is not paid 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.430
 edson 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:23.520
 ae 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:25.680
 the fluffy 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.760
 So people it's playing here I have 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:33.300
 pause to it playing without serious 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.280
 already a rather violent sound is this 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.650
 Suddenly from below they push well. 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.620
 are two ducts down here on the scene gives 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.050
 to see but it fits a hand inside the duct 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.820
 it's a very violent sound system 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.830
 I did not even imagine it was everything 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.840
 This when I went to buy 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.700
 It has a nice finish here in 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.310
 top is made of carbon fiber 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:58.260
 you feel here the texture of the fiber 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:00.000
 of carbon is the boxes also the boxes 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.320
 have a good finish here from the side not 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.010
 I do not know, I do not think so. 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.830
 okay because there's more dark or 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.440
 less than 40 kilos each box 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.970
 if you go to the store when you go 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.169
 buy not go by car 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.820
 if it is indicative, it is because my 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.090
 can not bring it all at once 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.590
 I had two cars with me. 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.710
 search because these boxes here 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.030
 it really does not fit in a car at 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.910
 two boxes together 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.260
 I do not know if you can see it here but it's almost 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.720
 of leg size 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.440
 the box is very large and is very wide 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.210
 it is also usually when you go out on the 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.000
 video can not get all this notion of 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:45.560
 Her size is a very large box. 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.550
 and I've already played 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.560
 serious reinforcement 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.620
 Now I'm going to play more or 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.919
 less in volume 20 another song in the 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:05:03.440
 volume 20 with severe reinforcement 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:03.440
 activate it and where it duck servicinho 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.080
 Here is the recognition of Japan. 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.139
 I am 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.870

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:06.000
 So, guys, for now, I believe. 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:08.730
 that this is for you what to buy is 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.960

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.660
 with the appliance 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:15.480
 it's worth what it was 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:18.630
 reading now is very worth even is a 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:21.750

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.670
 that you can hear down below but 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.040
 It was just for you to have a party. 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:34.440
 also needs power 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:40.380
 it will also be able to offer you the 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:43.740
 power and that's if you want I'll give
