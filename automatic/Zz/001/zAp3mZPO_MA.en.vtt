can often happen is that most likely as

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.290 
can often happen is that most likely as
a<00:00:15.839> result<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.350> weight<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:17.520> black<00:00:17.970> ring

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
a result of weight this black ring

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.900 
a result of weight this black ring
deforms<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.830> white<00:00:20.130> button<00:00:20.490> inside

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
depress or release and that means that

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.089 
depress or release and that means that
you<00:00:29.789> are<00:00:29.820> unable<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.269> adjust<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:31.199> height<00:00:31.349> just

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
maybe only locks in one place or it

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.040

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
want to sand it so that it very easily

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:28.010 
such that it will go all around the edge
and<00:03:23.270> then<00:03:24.270> we're<00:03:24.420> going<00:03:24.570> to<00:03:24.690> make<00:03:26.480> and<00:03:27.480> around

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
and then we're going to make and around

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:40.500 
and then we're going to make and around
evenly

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
as you do this you want to go evenly

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.550 
as you do this you want to go evenly
around<00:03:45.849> the<00:03:46.000> edge<00:03:46.150> such<00:03:46.780> that<00:03:47.079> it's<00:03:47.319> all

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
around the edge such that it's all

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.270 
around the edge such that it's all
sanded<00:03:48.129> down<00:03:48.189> to<00:03:48.610> approximately<00:03:48.819> the<00:03:49.510> same

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
sanded down to approximately the same

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.910 
sanded down to approximately the same
width<00:03:51.280> on<00:03:51.610> all<00:03:51.970> sides<00:03:52.329> and<00:03:52.750> you<00:03:52.989> can<00:03:53.170> test<00:03:53.590> as

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
width on all sides and you can test as

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.940 
width on all sides and you can test as
you<00:03:53.980> go<00:03:54.489> do<00:03:55.299> a<00:03:55.329> few<00:03:55.629> rotations<00:03:56.230> all<00:03:56.500> around<00:03:56.829> the

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
you go do a few rotations all around the

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.860 
you go do a few rotations all around the
button<00:03:57.250> and<00:03:57.430> then<00:03:57.730> test<00:03:58.120> to<00:03:58.239> see<00:03:58.510> whether<00:03:58.720> it

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
button and then test to see whether it

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.860 
button and then test to see whether it
has<00:03:58.989> now<00:03:59.170> become<00:03:59.650> easy<00:03:59.980> so<00:04:00.970> still<00:04:01.569> a<00:04:01.599> little

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
has now become easy so still a little

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.569 
has now become easy so still a little
bit<00:04:02.079> tight<00:04:02.319> in<00:04:02.590> this<00:04:02.799> case<00:04:03.040> but<00:04:03.250> you<00:04:03.340> want<00:04:03.519> it

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
bit tight in this case but you want it

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:32.390 
bit tight in this case but you want it
to<00:04:03.700> move<00:04:04.120> in<00:04:04.390> and<00:04:04.690> out<00:04:04.810> easily

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.800 

in<00:04:33.400> this<00:04:33.520> case<00:04:33.759> right

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
in this case right

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.899 
in this case right
in<00:04:35.289> this<00:04:35.409> case<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:35.800> button<00:04:36.099> was<00:04:36.280> not<00:04:36.460> that<00:04:36.669> bad

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:36.909 
in this case the button was not that bad

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:39.270 
in this case the button was not that bad
but<00:04:37.360> in<00:04:37.629> some<00:04:37.870> cases<00:04:38.110> it<00:04:38.409> can<00:04:38.560> take<00:04:38.620> a<00:04:38.949> while

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
but in some cases it can take a while

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.710 
but in some cases it can take a while
before<00:04:40.240> it<00:04:40.810> slides<00:04:41.800> the<00:04:42.099> internet<00:04:42.520> easily<00:04:43.030> but

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
before it slides the internet easily but

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.990 
before it slides the internet easily but
once<00:04:44.250> once<00:04:45.250> you<00:04:45.340> get<00:04:45.580> it<00:04:45.699> to<00:04:45.849> a<00:04:45.879> good<00:04:46.530> position

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
once once you get it to a good position

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.909 
once once you get it to a good position
then<00:04:49.000> you<00:04:49.030> can<00:04:49.599> reassemble<00:04:50.500> them<00:04:50.650> the

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
then you can reassemble them the

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.270 
then you can reassemble them the
mechanism<00:04:51.729> and<00:04:52.650> the<00:04:53.650> problem<00:04:54.039> should<00:04:54.220> be

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
mechanism and the problem should be

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.749 
mechanism and the problem should be
solved<00:04:54.669> I<00:04:55.530> have<00:04:56.530> put<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:56.919> mechanism<00:04:57.460> back<00:04:57.580> in

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:57.759 
solved I have put the mechanism back in

00:04:57.759 --> 00:04:59.490 
solved I have put the mechanism back in
place<00:04:58.000> and<00:04:58.030> screwed<00:04:58.659> it<00:04:58.840> from<00:04:59.110> the<00:04:59.319> backside

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
you want to test it a bit and make sure

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.050 
you want to test it a bit and make sure
that<00:05:02.229> the<00:05:02.379> screw<00:05:02.740> is<00:05:02.919> not<00:05:02.949> too<00:05:03.400> tight<00:05:03.639> on<00:05:03.879> the
