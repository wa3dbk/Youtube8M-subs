00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.859
 hello how about youtube friends in this 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.840
 video I'll show you how to replace 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.330
 the power supply of a 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.309
 brand television vision 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.309
 The first thing you should do is uncover 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.759
 the television 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.789
 and disconnect the power cord 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:24.160
 pressing down 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.970
 here has something that you have to see there 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.419
 turn down to untie 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.239
 after there the next step is 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:36.899
 verify voltage that does not have the 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.899
 trainer 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.550
 you have to use a 120 lamp 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.550
 volts 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:49.640
 and in this case I have some pieces here 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:52.550
 of crocodile in one of the tips 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.239
 I'll put it on one of the legs and with the 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.930
 another tip I will touch the other leg of the 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.150
 trainer 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.430
 in this case it has no current because 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:07.970
 I leave it off all night 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.120
 and already in this way it is safe to touch 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.000
 the power supply once 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.510
 they are sure that there is no voltage 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.510
 capacitor 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.180
 after having confirmed that no 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.460
 there is voltage in the capacitor what there is 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.380
 what to do next is to disconnect these 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.450
 two connectors and you have to have a lot 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.390
 careful not to pull the cables I will 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.570
 teach how they should disconnect 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.570
 the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.280
 to disconnect safely the 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.970
 connector you have to remove this first 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.640
 piece of black ribbon that they have 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.409
 use two screwdriver flat sites with 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.090
 a flat screwdriver here has a 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.090
 tongue that you have to lift towards 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.840
 up a little bit with the other one there is 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.359
 press back 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.310
 here we have the tongue and with this 

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:07.729
 another we press back until 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.020
 leave safely without having to 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:14.750
 Pull the cables 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.750
 now let's see the other connector 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.130
 this connector this I do not know for what reason 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.770
 but my tongue broke , which I did not 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.540
 you have it but you have to use two 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.750
 screwdrivers making pressure towards 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.750
 behind 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.420
 you have to go little by little 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.420
 doing backward pressure 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.520
 happens that the connector is disconnected to 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.580
 nothing ja link of the negative or 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.020
 negative because if they take it out of here already 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.700
 it's going to be a problem so they can 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.300
 solve the problem 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:56.090
 after there you have to remove two 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.470
 screws and remove these tape 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.910
 but the first thing we're going to do here 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.910
 is to remove these facebook 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.010
 in this part of here there are two screws 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.010
 which must be removed 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.390
 after successfully disconnecting 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:25.950
 the wires no longer is thing to remove 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.950
 these two screws 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.270
 and ready 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.730
 here we have already what is the source of 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.780
 power of this TV 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.360
 an easy way to replace it in case 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.190
 that one does not have experience in 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.340
 electronics you can replace a 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.049
 card is sometimes easier and in 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.659
 sometimes even cheaper because 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:00.450
 you can find them on ebay at a 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:02.780
 very accessible price between 60 and 70 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.780
 Dollars 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.640
 to put it back everything that is 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.010
 have to do 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.330
 it's the other way around the first thing is to screw 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:17.310
 put the tapes back and already by 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.720
 last after it is screwed 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.720
 connect the cables 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.860
 we connect the connector back 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:49.700
 precias pressing inward to 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:54.670
 get well put back this tape 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.670
 black that has this metal part here 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:07.419
 we connect the other connector pushing 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:12.430
 inwardly that is well tucked 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.430
 we return this tape 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:20.840
 and ready we have here back the 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.289
 TV power supply 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.289
