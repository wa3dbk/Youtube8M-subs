getting at first there's a lot of

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.460

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
bounce off we move in a little closer

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.490 
bounce off we move in a little closer
here<00:01:23.360> you<00:01:24.360> can<00:01:24.509> see<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.810> my<00:01:24.930> thumb<00:01:25.229> isn't

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
so once you can get a good tone on the

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.850 
so once you can get a good tone on the
e-string<00:01:34.220> try<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> string<00:01:36.619> fight<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.770> the

e-string try it on a string fight on the
D<00:01:38.040> string<00:01:38.570> I<00:01:39.570> try<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.049> on<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.229> g<00:01:40.409> string<00:01:40.880> first

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
D string I try it on the g string first

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.490 
D string I try it on the g string first
you<00:01:42.450> might<00:01:42.600> have<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.810> little<00:01:42.990> trouble<00:01:43.229> getting

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
you might have a little trouble getting

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.859 
you might have a little trouble getting
a<00:01:43.799> good<00:01:44.040> snap<00:01:44.430> out<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.909> D<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.149> g<00:01:45.329> strings

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
a good snap out of the D and g strings

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.190 
a good snap out of the D and g strings
but<00:01:46.619> if<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.920> persevere<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.790> keep<00:01:48.200> something

like<00:02:03.659> if<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.899> might<00:02:04.079> normally<00:02:04.259> do<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.799> g<00:02:05.070> major

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
like if you might normally do a g major

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.570 
like if you might normally do a g major
scale

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
scale

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.790

just<00:02:08.580> do<00:02:08.759> with<00:02:08.940> your<00:02:09.090> thumb<00:02:12.530> feel<00:02:13.530> free<00:02:13.740> to

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
just do with your thumb feel free to

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.590 
just do with your thumb feel free to
start<00:02:14.070> as<00:02:14.250> slow<00:02:14.520> as<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:14.730> mean<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.060> start<00:02:15.390> at

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
start as slow as you mean to start at

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.840 
start as slow as you mean to start at
first<00:02:15.930> it'll<00:02:16.230> be<00:02:16.380> hard<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.950> get<00:02:17.100> your<00:02:17.160> thumb<00:02:17.580> to

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
first it'll be hard to get your thumb to

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.880 
first it'll be hard to get your thumb to
move<00:02:18.590> too<00:02:19.590> much<00:02:19.620> faster<00:02:20.370> than<00:02:20.550> this<00:02:20.730> probably

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
move too much faster than this probably

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.740 
move too much faster than this probably
but<00:02:22.890> honestly<00:02:23.490> if<00:02:23.700> you<00:02:23.850> just<00:02:24.030> keep<00:02:24.300> doing<00:02:24.840> it

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
but honestly if you just keep doing it

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.230 
but honestly if you just keep doing it
it'll<00:02:27.750> get<00:02:27.930> easier<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:29.160> go<00:02:29.280> fast<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:29.940> then<00:02:30.090> you

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
it'll get easier to go fast and then you

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.560 
it'll get easier to go fast and then you
can<00:02:30.450> follow<00:02:31.410> along<00:02:31.560> with<00:02:31.830> Marcus<00:02:32.370> Miller<00:02:32.610> or

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
can follow along with Marcus Miller or

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.080 
can follow along with Marcus Miller or
try<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.560> so<00:02:36.410> so<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.560> scales<00:02:37.920> are<00:02:38.130> great<00:02:38.370> run

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
try to so so the scales are great run

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
try to so so the scales are great run
some<00:02:39.300> more<00:02:39.330> PES<00:02:39.660> do<00:02:41.090> run<00:02:42.090> some<00:02:42.330> baselines<00:02:42.840> you

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
some more PES do run some baselines you

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:54.830 
some more PES do run some baselines you
like<00:02:52.400> you<00:02:53.400> know<00:02:53.550> funk<00:02:53.880> really<00:02:54.180> lends<00:02:54.390> itself

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
like you know funk really lends itself

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.480 
like you know funk really lends itself
to<00:02:54.990> the<00:02:55.260> thumb<00:02:55.470> technique<00:02:55.740> although<00:02:56.250> that's

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
to the thumb technique although that's

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:05.300 
to the thumb technique although that's
not<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.820> only<00:02:56.880> place<00:02:57.270> you<00:02:57.450> can<00:02:57.600> use<00:02:57.810> it<00:03:04.310> you

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
not the only place you can use it you

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.070 
not the only place you can use it you
know<00:03:05.459> just<00:03:05.760> whatever<00:03:05.970> baselines<00:03:06.690> you<00:03:06.900> like

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
know just whatever baselines you like

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.390 
know just whatever baselines you like
just<00:03:07.410> see<00:03:07.560> if<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:07.680> can<00:03:07.890> play<00:03:07.980> them<00:03:08.160> with<00:03:08.250> your

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
just see if you can play them with your

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.479 
just see if you can play them with your
thumb<00:03:08.640> it's<00:03:09.170> it's<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.320> fun<00:03:10.530> experiment<00:03:11.100> and

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
thumb it's it's a fun experiment and

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.940 
thumb it's it's a fun experiment and
it's<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.820> good<00:03:12.000> way<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.239> start<00:03:12.780> getting<00:03:13.140> more

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
it's a good way to start getting more

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.809 
it's a good way to start getting more
versed<00:03:14.580> with<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:14.940> technique

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.970 

one<00:03:18.090> little<00:03:18.659> bit<00:03:18.840> of<00:03:18.959> my<00:03:19.110> new<00:03:19.290> show<00:03:19.500> I<00:03:19.530> will<00:03:19.800> add

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
one little bit of my new show I will add

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.920 
one little bit of my new show I will add
at<00:03:20.129> this<00:03:20.280> point<00:03:20.550> is<00:03:20.730> just<00:03:20.760> to<00:03:21.060> pay<00:03:21.480> attention

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
at this point is just to pay attention

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.350 
at this point is just to pay attention
to<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.110> angle<00:03:22.470> that<00:03:22.530> your<00:03:23.099> thumb<00:03:23.640> is<00:03:23.940> at<00:03:24.150> at

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
to the angle that your thumb is at at

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.570 
to the angle that your thumb is at at
this<00:03:24.569> joint<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:25.260> lot<00:03:25.739> of<00:03:25.830> times<00:03:26.040> people<00:03:26.430> have<00:03:26.519> a

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
this joint a lot of times people have a

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.820 
this joint a lot of times people have a
lot<00:03:26.760> of<00:03:26.790> flex<00:03:27.180> here<00:03:27.569> and<00:03:27.750> I<00:03:28.200> don't<00:03:28.409> recommend

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
lot of flex here and I don't recommend

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.080 
lot of flex here and I don't recommend
doing<00:03:28.890> that<00:03:29.280> because<00:03:29.430> it<00:03:29.610> adds<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.909> lot<00:03:30.030> of

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
doing that because it adds a lot of

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.789 
doing that because it adds a lot of
tension<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:30.810> your<00:03:30.840> arm<00:03:31.080> that<00:03:31.260> you<00:03:31.349> don't<00:03:31.590> need

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
tension to your arm that you don't need

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.039 
tension to your arm that you don't need
and<00:03:32.129> when<00:03:32.879> you're<00:03:33.030> slapping<00:03:33.510> you<00:03:33.599> really<00:03:33.840> want

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
and when you're slapping you really want

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.619 
and when you're slapping you really want
your<00:03:34.170> arm<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.590> be<00:03:34.739> happy<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:35.819> relaxed

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
your arm to be happy and relaxed

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.199 
your arm to be happy and relaxed
so<00:03:37.230> rather<00:03:37.920> than<00:03:38.069> hyper<00:03:38.430> extending<00:03:38.970> at<00:03:39.060> this

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
so rather than hyper extending at this

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.630 
so rather than hyper extending at this
joint<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:39.690> just<00:03:39.780> keep<00:03:40.110> it<00:03:40.260> straight<00:03:40.640> so

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
joint and just keep it straight so

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.670 
joint and just keep it straight so
there's<00:03:42.060> no<00:03:42.269> doesn't<00:03:43.230> need<00:03:43.319> to<00:03:43.410> be<00:03:43.530> any

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
there's no doesn't need to be any

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.069 
there's no doesn't need to be any
tension<00:03:43.829> in<00:03:44.160> this<00:03:44.340> joint<00:03:44.640> just<00:03:45.329> needs<00:03:45.569> to<00:03:45.780> be<00:03:45.900> a

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
tension in this joint just needs to be a

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.589 
tension in this joint just needs to be a
solid<00:03:46.620> straight<00:03:46.980> line<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.489> let<00:03:48.060> your<00:03:48.209> risk<00:03:48.390> to

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
solid straight line and let your risk to

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.980 
solid straight line and let your risk to
all<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.900> work

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.470 

that's<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:52.740> fundamentals<00:03:53.430> of<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:54.210> thumb

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
that's the fundamentals of the thumb

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.320 
that's the fundamentals of the thumb
part<00:03:55.080> of<00:03:55.320> slap<00:03:55.920> technique<00:03:56.220> obviously<00:03:56.730> there

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
part of slap technique obviously there

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.970 
part of slap technique obviously there
are<00:03:57.420> more<00:03:57.570> components<00:03:58.170> which<00:03:58.320> we'll<00:03:58.500> get<00:03:58.680> into

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
are more components which we'll get into

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.860 
are more components which we'll get into
but<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.910> first<00:04:00.150> thing<00:04:00.330> to<00:04:00.420> start<00:04:00.690> with<00:04:00.750> is

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
but the first thing to start with is

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.710 
but the first thing to start with is
really<00:04:01.110> just<00:04:01.410> getting<00:04:01.710> a<00:04:01.770> good<00:04:01.920> tone<00:04:02.720> keeping

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
really just getting a good tone keeping

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.960 
really just getting a good tone keeping
it<00:04:03.810> funky<00:04:04.230> you<00:04:04.890> know<00:04:05.040> you<00:04:05.100> can<00:04:05.340> run<00:04:05.550> this<00:04:05.730> with

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
it funky you know you can run this with

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.880 
it funky you know you can run this with
a<00:04:06.000> metronome<00:04:06.450> or<00:04:06.750> a<00:04:06.810> drum<00:04:07.050> machine<00:04:07.200> just<00:04:07.590> start

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
a metronome or a drum machine just start

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.310 
a metronome or a drum machine just start
really<00:04:08.190> locking<00:04:08.610> it<00:04:08.730> in<00:04:08.880> right<00:04:09.090> away<00:04:09.390> and<00:04:09.630> then

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
really locking it in right away and then

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.110 
really locking it in right away and then
start<00:04:10.710> running<00:04:10.860> it<00:04:11.070> with<00:04:11.190> some<00:04:11.370> patterns<00:04:11.820> do

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
start running it with some patterns do

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.580 
start running it with some patterns do
some<00:04:12.330> scales<00:04:12.690> play<00:04:13.170> some<00:04:13.380> of<00:04:13.410> your<00:04:13.500> favorite

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
some scales play some of your favorite

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.430 
some scales play some of your favorite
bass<00:04:14.040> lines<00:04:14.400> see<00:04:15.270> what<00:04:15.420> you<00:04:15.510> can<00:04:15.780> and<00:04:15.960> can't<00:04:16.170> do

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
bass lines see what you can and can't do
