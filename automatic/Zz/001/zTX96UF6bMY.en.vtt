episode 272 of Naruto Shippuden I

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.270 
episode 272 of Naruto Shippuden I
originally<00:00:46.110> wasn't<00:00:46.289> too<00:00:46.680> looking<00:00:46.890> forward<00:00:47.219> to

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
originally wasn't too looking forward to

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.889 
originally wasn't too looking forward to
it<00:00:47.370> because<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.610> remember<00:00:47.670> this<00:00:48.329> content<00:00:48.750> in

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
it because I remember this content in

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.860 
it because I remember this content in
the<00:00:48.989> manga<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:50.579> wasn't<00:00:51.120> too<00:00:51.329> fond<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
the manga and I wasn't too fond of the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.209 
the manga and I wasn't too fond of the
fight<00:00:52.050> because<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.320> wasn't<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.739> big<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.129> a

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
fight because I wasn't that big of a

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.090 
fight because I wasn't that big of a
samurai<00:00:53.850> fan<00:00:54.270> as<00:00:54.600> far<00:00:55.079> as<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.289> can<00:00:55.350> all<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.890> going

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
samurai fan as far as I can all is going

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.369 
samurai fan as far as I can all is going
to<00:00:56.160> be<00:00:56.219> samurais<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.699> Shinobi's<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.989> you

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
to be samurais and Shinobi's and you

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.020 
to be samurais and Shinobi's and you
know<00:00:58.500> not<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.920> wasn't<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> big<00:00:59.370> samurai<00:00:59.760> fan

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
know not that I wasn't a big samurai fan

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.400 
know not that I wasn't a big samurai fan
but<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.270> guess<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.629> wasn't<00:01:00.899> really<00:01:00.989> just<00:01:01.260> in

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
but I guess I wasn't really just in

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.039 
but I guess I wasn't really just in
normal<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.460> want<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.730> see<00:01:02.879> just<00:01:03.449> ninjas<00:01:03.899> so

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
normal so I want to see just ninjas so

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.219 
normal so I want to see just ninjas so
it<00:01:04.290> was<00:01:04.409> kind<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.769> weird<00:01:05.189> thing<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.430> see<00:01:05.729> a

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
it was kind of a weird thing to see a

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.179 
it was kind of a weird thing to see a
samurais<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.560> know<00:01:07.650> fighting<00:01:08.070> and

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
samurais and you know fighting and

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.460 
samurais and you know fighting and
whatnot<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.640> before<00:01:09.479> they<00:01:09.600> actually<00:01:09.780> this

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
whatnot and before they actually this

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.289 
whatnot and before they actually this
episode<00:01:10.920> definitely<00:01:11.700> in<00:01:11.760> my<00:01:11.790> opinion<00:01:11.880> was

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
episode definitely in my opinion was

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.520 
episode definitely in my opinion was
handled<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> lot<00:01:12.780> better<00:01:12.990> than<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.229> manga

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
handled a lot better than the manga

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.980 
handled a lot better than the manga
because<00:01:13.650> buffoon<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.460> Hanzo<00:01:15.150> fight<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.600> felt

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
because buffoon a and Hanzo fight I felt

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.469 
because buffoon a and Hanzo fight I felt
as<00:01:16.170> though<00:01:16.400> not<00:01:17.400> necessarily<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.150> wave<00:01:18.299> of

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
as though not necessarily the wave of

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.030 
as though not necessarily the wave of
stage<00:01:18.689> because<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.439> way<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.710> was<00:01:19.830> staged

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
stage because the way it was staged

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.490 
stage because the way it was staged
arguably<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:21.030> was<00:01:21.150> kind<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.360> like<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:22.170> know

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
arguably it was kind of like you know

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.499 
arguably it was kind of like you know
Hanzo<00:01:23.159> probably<00:01:23.670> should<00:01:23.880> have<00:01:23.909> dominated

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
Hanzo probably should have dominated

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.300 
Hanzo probably should have dominated
Mifune<00:01:24.990> I'll<00:01:25.320> agree<00:01:25.500> with<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.680> but<00:01:26.040> I

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
Mifune I'll agree with that but I

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.039 
Mifune I'll agree with that but I
definitely<00:01:27.210> say<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.750> way<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.960> was

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
definitely say that the way it was

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.260 
definitely say that the way it was

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.170 
knew about that before but it was
interesting<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:20.829> see<00:02:21.340> in<00:02:21.400> this<00:02:21.549> episode<00:02:22.000> and

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
interesting to see in this episode and

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.429 
interesting to see in this episode and
understand<00:02:22.659> a<00:02:22.719> little<00:02:22.750> bit<00:02:23.019> more<00:02:23.170> about<00:02:23.319> the

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:23.439 
understand a little bit more about the

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.039

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
Hanzo character and exactly that he

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.410 
Hanzo character and exactly that he
wasn't<00:02:26.409> necessarily<00:02:26.519> completely<00:02:27.519> like<00:02:27.909> you

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
wasn't necessarily completely like you

wasn't necessarily completely like you
know<00:02:28.510> just<00:02:28.750> this<00:02:28.870> awful<00:02:29.500> guy<00:02:29.650> I<00:02:29.920> think<00:02:30.010> when<00:02:30.400> he

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
know just this awful guy I think when he

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:31.559 
know just this awful guy I think when he
betrayed

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
betrayed

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.059 
betrayed
Nagato<00:02:32.109> and<00:02:32.409> stuff<00:02:32.560> like<00:02:32.680> that<00:02:32.829> that<00:02:32.859> was

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
Nagato and stuff like that that was

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.550 
Nagato and stuff like that that was
definitely<00:02:33.299> inspired<00:02:34.299> by<00:02:34.599> Danzo<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.470> know

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
definitely inspired by Danzo you know

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.129 
definitely inspired by Danzo you know
that<00:02:35.709> creep<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.220> Danzo<00:02:36.760> is<00:02:36.790> so<00:02:37.569> III

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:38.139 
that creep that Danzo is so III

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:39.869 
that creep that Danzo is so III
definitely<00:02:38.409> say<00:02:38.769> that<00:02:38.799> the<00:02:38.980> Hanzo<00:02:39.310> guy<00:02:39.459> wasn't

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
definitely say that the Hanzo guy wasn't

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.390 
definitely say that the Hanzo guy wasn't
bad<00:02:40.090> he<00:02:40.420> was<00:02:40.569> just<00:02:40.750> very<00:02:40.900> prideful<00:02:41.620> person<00:02:42.040> or

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
bad he was just very prideful person or

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.399 
bad he was just very prideful person or
maybe<00:02:42.939> he<00:02:43.209> was<00:02:43.329> bad<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.659> an<00:02:43.720> extent<00:02:44.079> because<00:02:44.170> he

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
maybe he was bad to an extent because he

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:45.960 
maybe he was bad to an extent because he
did<00:02:44.560> do<00:02:44.680> some<00:02:44.889> things<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:45.430> regardless<00:02:45.819> of

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
take the blame regardless because he did

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.909 
take the blame regardless because he did
do<00:02:49.569> it<00:02:49.720> but<00:02:49.870> you<00:02:50.560> know<00:02:50.620> this<00:02:50.799> particular
