00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
nothing different other than that and

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.179 
nothing different other than that and
the<00:02:00.869> way<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.079> works<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.520> when<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.640> gets<00:02:04.100> when<00:02:05.100> it

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
the way it works is when it gets when it

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.800 
the way it works is when it gets when it
gets<00:02:05.540> to<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:06.689> point<00:02:06.960> right<00:02:07.140> here<00:02:08.060> it<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.539> uses

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
gets to this point right here it it uses

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.110 
gets to this point right here it it uses
this<00:02:10.140> song<00:02:10.470> block<00:02:11.220> detector<00:02:11.700> switch<00:02:11.940> right

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
this song block detector switch right

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.440 
this song block detector switch right
here

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
here

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.990 
here
and<00:02:14.110> if<00:02:14.380> it<00:02:14.560> if<00:02:15.220> this<00:02:15.580> detects<00:02:16.890> that<00:02:17.910> there's<00:02:18.910> a

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
and if it if this detects that there's a

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.120 
and if it if this detects that there's a
cart<00:02:19.390> there<00:02:19.630> what<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:20.320> does<00:02:20.470> is<00:02:20.590> it<00:02:20.710> powers

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
cart there what it does is it powers

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.130 
cart there what it does is it powers
this<00:02:21.880> block<00:02:22.180> which<00:02:22.390> changes<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.960> block

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
this block which changes the block

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.560 
this block which changes the block
detector<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:25.180> powers<00:02:25.420> it<00:02:25.660> on<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:27.450> mean<00:02:28.450> if

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
detector and it powers it on I mean if

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.010 
detector and it powers it on I mean if
there's<00:02:28.750> not<00:02:28.930> one<00:02:29.170> there<00:02:29.320> and<00:02:30.240> in<00:02:31.240> combination

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
there's not one there and in combination

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.360 
there's not one there and in combination
with<00:02:32.110> this<00:02:32.320> one<00:02:33.330> it<00:02:34.330> will<00:02:34.540> make<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:35.050> cart<00:02:35.370> turn

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
with this one it will make the cart turn

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.010 
with this one it will make the cart turn
left<00:02:37.350> now<00:02:39.090> once<00:02:40.090> it's<00:02:40.300> switched<00:02:40.600> off<00:02:40.780> like

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
left now once it's switched off like

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.390 
left now once it's switched off like
this<00:02:41.340> right<00:02:42.340> here<00:02:43.980> let<00:02:44.980> me<00:02:45.010> show<00:02:45.070> you<00:02:45.250> over

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
this right here let me show you over

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.280 
this right here let me show you over
here<00:02:45.490> it's<00:02:45.790> better<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.120> show<00:02:46.270> you<00:02:46.330> here<00:02:46.600> see

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
here it's better to show you here see

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.510 
here it's better to show you here see
it's<00:02:47.440> just<00:02:47.590> a<00:02:47.740> um<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.750> switch<00:02:49.750> right<00:02:49.990> here<00:02:50.140> and

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
it's just a um and switch right here and

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.070 
it's just a um and switch right here and
when<00:02:51.520> this<00:02:51.700> one<00:02:51.880> is<00:02:51.910> off<00:02:53.040> right<00:02:54.040> here<00:02:55.080> what

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
when this one is off right here what

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.600 
when this one is off right here what
that<00:02:56.320> means<00:02:56.530> that<00:02:56.680> there's<00:02:56.890> a<00:02:57.010> cart<00:02:57.430> there

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
that means that there's a cart there

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.060 
that means that there's a cart there
because<00:02:57.880> it<00:02:58.000> hit<00:02:58.510> this<00:02:58.720> switch<00:02:58.900> switch<00:02:59.830> the

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
because it hit this switch switch the

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.240 
because it hit this switch switch the
block<00:03:00.340> detector<00:03:01.210> turned<00:03:02.080> it<00:03:02.200> off<00:03:02.350> which<00:03:03.070> means

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
block detector turned it off which means

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.280 
block detector turned it off which means
that<00:03:03.640> now<00:03:03.850> this<00:03:04.210> cart<00:03:04.510> can<00:03:04.690> go<00:03:04.870> through<00:03:05.260> here

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
that now this cart can go through here

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.550 
that now this cart can go through here
and<00:03:05.700> not<00:03:06.700> turn<00:03:07.000> so<00:03:07.690> I<00:03:07.720> have<00:03:07.900> one<00:03:08.110> set<00:03:08.320> on<00:03:08.350> each

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
and not turn so I have one set on each

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:16.290 
and not turn so I have one set on each
one<00:03:08.860> and<00:03:13.710> obviously<00:03:14.710> it<00:03:14.950> when<00:03:15.940> this<00:03:16.120> one's

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
one and obviously it when this one's

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.690 
one and obviously it when this one's
powered<00:03:16.630> right<00:03:16.780> here<00:03:17.080> it<00:03:17.740> and<00:03:18.340> that<00:03:18.580> one's

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
powered right here it and that one's

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.650 
powered right here it and that one's
powered<00:03:19.030> it<00:03:19.180> powers<00:03:20.250> this<00:03:21.250> torch<00:03:21.820> which<00:03:22.360> then

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
powered it powers this torch which then

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.950 
powered it powers this torch which then
changes<00:03:22.990> the<00:03:23.980> direction<00:03:24.550> of<00:03:24.610> that<00:03:25.480> so<00:03:25.810> that

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
changes the direction of that so that

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.610 
changes the direction of that so that
the<00:03:26.050> cart<00:03:26.290> turns<00:03:26.530> down<00:03:26.770> here<00:03:27.010> and<00:03:27.550> once<00:03:28.180> it's

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
the cart turns down here and once it's

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.350 
the cart turns down here and once it's
deactivated<00:03:29.620> it<00:03:30.010> won't<00:03:30.190> turn<00:03:30.370> again<00:03:30.700> so<00:03:31.060> the

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
deactivated it won't turn again so the

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.550 
deactivated it won't turn again so the
cart<00:03:31.600> will<00:03:31.750> be<00:03:31.810> able<00:03:31.900> to<00:03:31.990> go<00:03:32.050> down<00:03:32.170> to<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.380> next

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
cart will be able to go down to the next

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.250 
cart will be able to go down to the next
one<00:03:32.770> like<00:03:33.400> that<00:03:33.640> um<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:36.040> have<00:03:36.310> to<00:03:36.340> have<00:03:36.730> a

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
one like that um you have to have a

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.230 
one like that um you have to have a
switch<00:03:38.260> here<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:39.760> what<00:03:40.390> this<00:03:40.570> switch<00:03:40.900> does<00:03:41.170> is

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
switch here and what this switch does is

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:49.260 
switch here and what this switch does is
on<00:03:45.570> this<00:03:46.570> one<00:03:46.810> will<00:03:47.080> switch<00:03:47.350> the<00:03:47.560> track<00:03:47.890> as<00:03:48.280> the

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
on this one will switch the track as the

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.820 
on this one will switch the track as the
carts<00:03:49.510> are<00:03:49.600> going<00:03:49.840> this<00:03:50.050> way<00:03:50.230> because<00:03:50.470> if<00:03:50.709> they

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
carts are going this way because if they

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.960 
carts are going this way because if they
don't<00:03:51.010> they'll<00:03:51.220> turn<00:03:51.400> right<00:03:51.640> here<00:03:51.790> obviously

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
don't they'll turn right here obviously

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.510 
don't they'll turn right here obviously
so<00:03:52.900> as<00:03:53.170> it<00:03:53.320> hits<00:03:53.470> it<00:03:53.560> it'll<00:03:53.740> turn<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:53.980> track<00:03:54.310> so

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
so as it hits it it'll turn the track so

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.670 
so as it hits it it'll turn the track so
that<00:03:54.550> they<00:03:54.760> can<00:03:54.880> pass<00:03:55.090> through<00:03:55.350> it<00:03:56.350> has<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:56.620> be

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
that they can pass through it has to be

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.490 
that they can pass through it has to be
set<00:03:56.860> exactly<00:03:57.280> like<00:03:57.670> this<00:03:57.880> or<00:03:58.200> it<00:03:59.200> won't<00:03:59.350> work

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
set exactly like this or it won't work

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.340 
set exactly like this or it won't work
um<00:04:00.209> let<00:04:01.209> me<00:04:01.270> see<00:04:01.330> if<00:04:01.540> I<00:04:01.600> have<00:04:01.750> okay<00:04:02.020> I<00:04:02.050> haven't

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
um let me see if I have okay I haven't

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.900 
um let me see if I have okay I haven't
done<00:04:02.440> the<00:04:02.560> last<00:04:02.740> one<00:04:03.040> down<00:04:03.250> here<00:04:03.520> it<00:04:03.670> hasn't

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
done the last one down here it hasn't

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.480 
done the last one down here it hasn't
haven't<00:04:04.300> sent<00:04:04.480> it<00:04:04.510> back<00:04:04.660> so<00:04:05.040> see<00:04:06.040> that's<00:04:06.190> on

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490 
haven't sent it back so see that's on

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.050 
haven't sent it back so see that's on
that<00:04:07.270> one's<00:04:07.480> on<00:04:07.630> and<00:04:08.370> then<00:04:09.370> when<00:04:09.520> it<00:04:09.640> when<00:04:09.970> they

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
that one's on and then when it when they

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.000 
that one's on and then when it when they
both<00:04:10.270> are<00:04:10.570> activated<00:04:11.110> it<00:04:11.170> turns<00:04:11.380> the<00:04:11.709> cart

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
both are activated it turns the cart

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.090 
both are activated it turns the cart
this<00:04:12.220> way<00:04:12.370> same<00:04:13.330> with<00:04:13.480> all<00:04:13.600> the<00:04:13.630> other<00:04:13.720> ones

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
this way same with all the other ones

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.380 
this way same with all the other ones
and<00:04:15.100> then<00:04:15.250> what<00:04:15.370> this<00:04:15.550> does<00:04:15.790> right<00:04:15.820> here<00:04:16.980> this

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
and then what this does right here this

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.960 
and then what this does right here this
when<00:04:19.390> the<00:04:19.600> cart<00:04:19.900> hits<00:04:20.290> this<00:04:20.620> and<00:04:20.890> changes<00:04:21.820> the

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
when the cart hits this and changes the

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.770 
when the cart hits this and changes the
block<00:04:22.180> detector<00:04:22.720> it<00:04:23.380> will<00:04:23.590> also<00:04:23.830> send

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
block detector it will also send

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.600 
block detector it will also send
the<00:04:25.140> next<00:04:25.470> cart<00:04:25.740> it<00:04:25.980> goes<00:04:26.010> up<00:04:26.370> through<00:04:26.400> the

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
the next cart it goes up through the

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.550 
the next cart it goes up through the
ceiling<00:04:27.030> right<00:04:27.330> here<00:04:30.020> down<00:04:31.020> here<00:04:31.050> and<00:04:31.410> then<00:04:31.500> it

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
ceiling right here down here and then it

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.800 
ceiling right here down here and then it
goes<00:04:31.710> to<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:32.010> next<00:04:32.220> block<00:04:32.550> that<00:04:33.060> pushes<00:04:33.690> the

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
goes to the next block that pushes the

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.280 
goes to the next block that pushes the
next<00:04:34.080> cart<00:04:34.290> along<00:04:35.570> so<00:04:36.570> it<00:04:36.780> has<00:04:36.930> to<00:04:37.020> be<00:04:37.080> stuff

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
next cart along so it has to be stuff

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.800 
next cart along so it has to be stuff
exactly<00:04:37.800> like<00:04:38.040> this<00:04:38.220> um<00:04:38.520> as<00:04:39.330> soon<00:04:39.420> as<00:04:39.600> you<00:04:39.690> hit

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
exactly like this um as soon as you hit

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.650 
exactly like this um as soon as you hit
that<00:04:40.110> switch<00:04:40.460> it<00:04:41.460> hits<00:04:41.850> that<00:04:42.090> the<00:04:42.420> next<00:04:43.290> car<00:04:43.500> um

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
that switch it hits that the next car um

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.540 
that switch it hits that the next car um
see<00:04:45.660> let<00:04:45.870> me<00:04:45.900> make<00:04:46.110> sure<00:04:46.140> I<00:04:46.620> have<00:04:47.190> it<00:04:47.220> kind<00:04:47.430> of

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
see let me make sure I have it kind of

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.990 
see let me make sure I have it kind of
labeled<00:04:47.970> right<00:04:48.090> here<00:04:49.610> and<00:04:50.610> you<00:04:50.760> have<00:04:50.820> the

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
labeled right here and you have the

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.960 
labeled right here and you have the
track<00:04:51.360> you'll<00:04:51.780> see<00:04:52.050> the<00:04:52.920> cart<00:04:53.250> detector

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
track you'll see the cart detector

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:59.180 
track you'll see the cart detector
that's<00:04:54.660> the<00:04:54.870> one<00:04:55.050> that<00:04:55.650> includes<00:04:56.370> the<00:04:58.190> block

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
that's the one that includes the block

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.850 
that's the one that includes the block
detector<00:04:59.640> switch<00:04:59.910> and<00:05:00.560> that's<00:05:01.560> the<00:05:01.710> actual

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
detector switch and that's the actual

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.900 
detector switch and that's the actual
change<00:05:02.040> detector<00:05:03.050> itself<00:05:04.050> then<00:05:04.950> this<00:05:05.730> one

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
change detector itself then this one

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.220 
change detector itself then this one
sends<00:05:06.210> the<00:05:06.270> next<00:05:06.480> car<00:05:06.690> the<00:05:06.870> ones<00:05:07.020> I<00:05:07.080> have

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
sends the next car the ones I have

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.250 
sends the next car the ones I have
labeled<00:05:07.560> there<00:05:07.740> the<00:05:07.890> blue<00:05:08.070> one<00:05:08.220> and<00:05:09.200> this<00:05:10.200> is

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
labeled there the blue one and this is

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.860 
labeled there the blue one and this is
the<00:05:10.380> reset<00:05:10.740> system

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
the reset system

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.930 
the reset system
excuse<00:05:12.870> me<00:05:13.020> once<00:05:13.560> you<00:05:13.710> send<00:05:14.040> once<00:05:14.490> all<00:05:14.730> of<00:05:14.760> your

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
excuse me once you send once all of your

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.000 
excuse me once you send once all of your
carts<00:05:15.419> are<00:05:15.540> sent<00:05:15.810> and<00:05:16.020> you<00:05:16.650> get<00:05:16.770> all<00:05:16.860> your

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
carts are sent and you get all your

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:22.040 
carts are sent and you get all your
stuff<00:05:17.220> off<00:05:17.430> though<00:05:20.030> you<00:05:21.030> have<00:05:21.240> to<00:05:21.390> reset<00:05:21.870> the

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
stuff off though you have to reset the

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.090 
stuff off though you have to reset the
block<00:05:22.230> detectors<00:05:22.800> and<00:05:22.980> this<00:05:23.610> one<00:05:23.790> right<00:05:23.940> here

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
block detectors and this one right here

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.850 
block detectors and this one right here
resets<00:05:26.100> all<00:05:26.400> the<00:05:26.580> block<00:05:26.760> detectors<00:05:27.800> now<00:05:28.800> you

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
resets all the block detectors now you

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:35.930 
resets all the block detectors now you
have<00:05:29.160> to<00:05:29.280> have<00:05:30.050> the<00:05:32.810> the<00:05:34.220> repeaters<00:05:35.220> here<00:05:35.250> and

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
have to have the the repeaters here and

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.760 
have to have the the repeaters here and
have<00:05:36.750> them<00:05:36.840> set<00:05:37.050> all<00:05:37.169> the<00:05:37.260> way<00:05:37.320> back<00:05:37.530> because

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
have them set all the way back because

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.530 
have them set all the way back because
it<00:05:38.070> needs<00:05:38.280> a<00:05:38.430> delay<00:05:38.729> if<00:05:38.910> you<00:05:39.030> don't<00:05:39.270> it'll

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
it needs a delay if you don't it'll

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.110 
it needs a delay if you don't it'll
switch<00:05:39.870> it<00:05:40.020> twice<00:05:40.229> real<00:05:40.560> quick<00:05:40.850> so<00:05:41.850> make<00:05:42.090> sure

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
switch it twice real quick so make sure

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.550 
switch it twice real quick so make sure
you<00:05:42.270> put<00:05:42.390> those<00:05:42.570> make<00:05:42.900> sure<00:05:43.050> when<00:05:43.229> you<00:05:43.320> build

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
you put those make sure when you build

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.200 
you put those make sure when you build
the<00:05:43.710> block<00:05:43.890> detector<00:05:44.310> you<00:05:44.520> have<00:05:44.700> these<00:05:44.910> set

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
the block detector you have these set

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.140 
the block detector you have these set
all<00:05:45.300> the<00:05:45.419> way<00:05:45.450> back<00:05:45.660> to<00:05:46.580> or<00:05:47.580> it'll<00:05:47.700> do<00:05:47.790> the<00:05:47.910> same

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
all the way back to or it'll do the same

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.300 
all the way back to or it'll do the same
thing<00:05:48.800> and<00:05:51.470> that<00:05:52.470> pretty<00:05:52.710> much<00:05:52.800> covers<00:05:53.130> it

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
thing and that pretty much covers it

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.280 
thing and that pretty much covers it
I'll<00:05:53.490> go<00:05:53.669> ahead<00:05:53.820> and<00:05:53.940> just<00:05:54.090> look<00:05:54.360> to<00:05:54.540> show<00:05:55.200> you

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 
I'll go ahead and just look to show you

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:01.250 
I'll go ahead and just look to show you
guys<00:05:55.470> all<00:05:55.500> this<00:05:55.860> right<00:05:56.100> here<00:05:59.270> yeah<00:06:00.270> this<00:06:00.510> this

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
guys all this right here yeah this this

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.770 
guys all this right here yeah this this
one<00:06:01.470> only<00:06:01.830> all<00:06:02.040> this<00:06:02.220> does<00:06:02.430> right<00:06:02.610> here<00:06:02.820> is<00:06:03.120> it

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
one only all this does right here is it

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.530 
one only all this does right here is it
allows<00:06:04.020> the<00:06:04.050> cart<00:06:04.970> so<00:06:05.970> that<00:06:06.000> it<00:06:06.150> won't<00:06:06.240> turn

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:06.540 
allows the cart so that it won't turn

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.110 
allows the cart so that it won't turn
here<00:06:06.930> it<00:06:06.960> just<00:06:07.650> changes<00:06:08.100> this<00:06:08.280> this<00:06:08.669> track

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
here it just changes this this track

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.330 
here it just changes this this track
right<00:06:09.300> here<00:06:09.590> just<00:06:10.590> for<00:06:10.710> the<00:06:10.830> second<00:06:11.160> that<00:06:11.250> it

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
right here just for the second that it

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.600 
right here just for the second that it
goes<00:06:11.460> through<00:06:11.520> and<00:06:12.410> all<00:06:13.410> these<00:06:13.590> are<00:06:13.770> obviously

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
goes through and all these are obviously

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.610 
goes through and all these are obviously
powered<00:06:15.060> like<00:06:15.240> I<00:06:15.330> have<00:06:15.510> here<00:06:15.919> these<00:06:16.919> tracks

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
powered like I have here these tracks

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.260 
powered like I have here these tracks
yeah<00:06:19.620> I<00:06:19.830> think<00:06:20.190> that<00:06:20.460> pretty<00:06:20.640> much<00:06:20.790> covers<00:06:21.090> it

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
yeah I think that pretty much covers it

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.080 
yeah I think that pretty much covers it
but<00:06:21.540> I<00:06:21.690> mean<00:06:21.870> I<00:06:22.110> think<00:06:23.100> this<00:06:23.310> is<00:06:23.370> a<00:06:23.490> really<00:06:23.910> cool

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.090 
but I mean I think this is a really cool

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:25.700 
but I mean I think this is a really cool
system<00:06:24.330> that<00:06:24.570> I<00:06:24.600> came<00:06:24.660> up<00:06:24.870> with<00:06:25.020> I<00:06:25.410> hope<00:06:25.530> you

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
system that I came up with I hope you

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.820 
system that I came up with I hope you
guys<00:06:25.860> like<00:06:26.160> it

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
guys like it

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.960 
guys like it
this<00:06:28.830> will<00:06:28.979> save<00:06:29.130> you<00:06:29.280> a<00:06:29.340> lot<00:06:29.370> of<00:06:29.490> time<00:06:29.790> on

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:29.970 
this will save you a lot of time on

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.420 
this will save you a lot of time on
mining<00:06:30.740> so<00:06:31.740> you'll<00:06:31.890> have<00:06:31.979> to<00:06:32.100> keep<00:06:32.250> walking

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430 
mining so you'll have to keep walking

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.640 
mining so you'll have to keep walking
back<00:06:32.849> you<00:06:33.150> can<00:06:33.270> have<00:06:33.450> one<00:06:33.780> person<00:06:33.990> unloading

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
back you can have one person unloading

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.460 
back you can have one person unloading
the<00:06:34.770> carts<00:06:35.300> if

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:36.470 
the carts if

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.720 
the carts if
you<00:06:36.560> want<00:06:36.800> um<00:06:37.130> I<00:06:39.130> don't<00:06:40.130> know<00:06:40.250> why<00:06:40.400> though<00:06:40.520> oh

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:40.730 
you want um I don't know why though oh

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.340 
you want um I don't know why though oh
it's<00:06:41.030> because<00:06:41.150> I<00:06:41.360> the<00:06:41.750> reason<00:06:41.900> that<00:06:42.080> one<00:06:42.200> did

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:42.350 
it's because I the reason that one did

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.580 
it's because I the reason that one did
that<00:06:42.380> is<00:06:42.560> because<00:06:42.740> I<00:06:42.800> hit<00:06:42.980> the<00:06:43.070> reset<00:06:43.850> switch

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.590 
that is because I hit the reset switch

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.050 
that is because I hit the reset switch
but<00:06:45.590> um<00:06:45.770> it'll<00:06:46.130> do<00:06:46.280> the<00:06:46.370> same<00:06:46.430> thing<00:06:46.790> again

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:47.060 
but um it'll do the same thing again

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.990 
but um it'll do the same thing again
right<00:06:47.090> here<00:06:47.950> and<00:06:48.950> then<00:06:49.070> go<00:06:49.190> that<00:06:49.400> way<00:06:49.580> but

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 
right here and then go that way but

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.190 
right here and then go that way but
it'll<00:06:50.120> it'll<00:06:50.360> eventually<00:06:50.600> get<00:06:50.900> to<00:06:50.990> the<00:06:51.080> right

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:51.200 
it'll it'll eventually get to the right

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.120 
it'll it'll eventually get to the right
spot<00:06:51.820> um<00:06:53.140> but<00:06:54.140> yeah<00:06:54.260> the<00:06:54.560> only<00:06:54.770> reason<00:06:54.980> it<00:06:55.040> did

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.130 
spot um but yeah the only reason it did

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:56.410 
spot um but yeah the only reason it did
that<00:06:55.160> is<00:06:55.310> because<00:06:55.370> I<00:06:55.520> hit<00:06:55.640> that<00:06:55.790> reset<00:06:55.970> switch

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:56.420 
that is because I hit that reset switch

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.600 
that is because I hit that reset switch
before<00:06:56.690> I<00:06:56.840> sent<00:06:57.080> it<00:06:57.170> back<00:06:57.370> so<00:06:58.370> that<00:06:58.400> pretty

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
before I sent it back so that pretty

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.430 
before I sent it back so that pretty
much<00:06:58.730> covers<00:06:59.000> it<00:06:59.210> on<00:06:59.540> you<00:06:59.720> have<00:06:59.810> to<00:06:59.900> have<00:07:00.080> the

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:00.440 
much covers it on you have to have the

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.620 
much covers it on you have to have the
repeaters<00:07:01.810> these<00:07:02.810> have<00:07:02.990> to<00:07:03.080> be<00:07:03.170> set<00:07:03.380> like<00:07:03.530> this

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:04.630 
repeaters these have to be set like this

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.830 
repeaters these have to be set like this
you<00:07:05.630> have<00:07:05.870> to<00:07:06.080> have<00:07:06.320> this<00:07:07.250> and<00:07:07.580> gate<00:07:08.000> so<00:07:08.330> the

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840 
you have to have this and gate so the

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.410 
you have to have this and gate so the
carts<00:07:09.260> can<00:07:09.500> go<00:07:09.710> back<00:07:10.040> through<00:07:10.070> here<00:07:10.730> once

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:11.420 
carts can go back through here once

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.220 
carts can go back through here once
there's<00:07:11.690> a<00:07:11.750> carp<00:07:12.170> set<00:07:12.560> here<00:07:13.840> and<00:07:14.840> I<00:07:15.020> think

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:15.230 
there's a carp set here and I think

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.720 
there's a carp set here and I think
that's<00:07:15.380> pretty<00:07:15.560> much<00:07:15.680> this<00:07:16.520> one<00:07:18.580> changes<00:07:19.580> the

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:19.730 
that's pretty much this one changes the

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.950 
that's pretty much this one changes the
tracks<00:07:20.000> so<00:07:20.270> that<00:07:20.300> it<00:07:20.510> doesn't<00:07:20.870> go<00:07:20.960> that<00:07:21.290> way

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 
tracks so that it doesn't go that way

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.480 
tracks so that it doesn't go that way
when<00:07:23.960> the<00:07:24.080> karts<00:07:24.320> coming<00:07:24.620> out<00:07:24.770> it<00:07:25.100> switches

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:25.490 
when the karts coming out it switches

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.150 
when the karts coming out it switches
that<00:07:25.760> tracking<00:07:26.330> goes<00:07:26.510> this<00:07:26.660> way

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:27.160 
that tracking goes this way

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.280 
that tracking goes this way
that<00:07:28.160> pretty<00:07:28.370> much<00:07:28.460> covers<00:07:28.880> it<00:07:28.910> I<00:07:29.270> really<00:07:30.200> hope
