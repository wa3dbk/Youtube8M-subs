this ship on the original ship I was
going<00:00:33.210> for<00:00:33.480> was<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.780> infinite<00:00:34.290> schumann<00:00:34.649> you

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
going for was the infinite schumann you

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.010 
going for was the infinite schumann you
should<00:00:34.950> be<00:00:35.040> guys<00:00:35.309> ever<00:00:35.489> seen<00:00:35.760> that

this ship gwanmi got the little the
prior<00:01:11.790> wings<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.270> never<00:01:12.450> liked<00:01:12.689> Anna<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290

prior wings I never liked Anna in the
first<00:01:13.500> place<00:01:13.619> but<00:01:13.830> now<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.400> think<00:01:14.729> it's<00:01:15.060> cool<00:01:15.299> it

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
first place but now I think it's cool it

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.020 
first place but now I think it's cool it
makes<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.900> look<00:01:15.990> unique<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.610> far<00:01:17.880> from

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
makes it look unique and so far from

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.249 
makes it look unique and so far from
what<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.270> heard<00:01:18.479> what<00:01:18.659> they<00:01:18.750> were<00:01:18.840> time<00:01:19.020> out<00:01:19.140> in

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
what I heard what they were time out in

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.140 
what I heard what they were time out in
the<00:01:19.350> next<00:01:19.470> great<00:01:19.740> starship<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.640> if<00:01:20.790> even<00:01:21.060> if

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
the next great starship that if even if

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.550 
the next great starship that if even if
you<00:01:21.240> don't<00:01:21.420> like<00:01:21.600> those<00:01:21.780> wings<00:01:22.110> gonna<00:01:22.380> have

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
you don't like those wings gonna have

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.960 
you don't like those wings gonna have
like<00:01:22.710> different<00:01:22.920> variants<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.729> can<00:01:23.880> have

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
like different variants so you can have

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.700 
like different variants so you can have
different<00:01:24.390> roles<00:01:24.540> with<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.080> ship<00:01:25.320> and

in the next great starship I don't know
if<00:01:36.270> they're<00:01:36.360> going<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.540> be<00:01:36.600> able<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.810> implement

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
if they're going to be able to implement

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.660 
if they're going to be able to implement
it<00:01:37.350> or<00:01:37.439> not<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:38.130> that's<00:01:38.280> what<00:01:38.430> they<00:01:38.520> said

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
it or not but that's what they said

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.010 
it or not but that's what they said
pretty<00:01:38.939> sure<00:01:39.030> chris<00:01:39.240> Roberts<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.689> gonna<00:01:39.869> let

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
pretty sure chris Roberts is gonna let

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.289 
pretty sure chris Roberts is gonna let
them<00:01:40.110> do<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.549> have<00:01:41.790> different<00:01:41.939> roles

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
them do that so you have different roles

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.780 
them do that so you have different roles
with<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.810> um<00:01:43.140> they<00:01:43.619> got<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.799> crane<00:01:44.250> as<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.700> the

stats are going to change throughout the

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.550 
stats are going to change throughout the
game<00:02:08.330> so<00:02:08.629> six<00:02:08.869> Marines<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:09.319> you're<00:02:09.440> gonna

have your your pilot set up the crew to
run<00:02:13.069> it<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:13.910> it's<00:02:14.330> got<00:02:14.480> pterence<00:02:15.110> so<00:02:15.470> like<00:02:15.650> I

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
run it and it's got pterence so like I

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.890 
run it and it's got pterence so like I
said<00:02:15.849> it's<00:02:16.849> a<00:02:16.910> lot<00:02:17.090> going<00:02:17.330> on<00:02:17.390> with<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:17.660> ship

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
said it's a lot going on with the ship

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.350 
said it's a lot going on with the ship
it<00:02:18.230> may<00:02:18.410> even<00:02:18.440> be<00:02:18.860> one<00:02:19.129> of<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.280> best<00:02:19.519> medium

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
it may even be one of the best medium

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.330 
it may even be one of the best medium
sized<00:02:20.660> ships<00:02:21.049> in<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.290> game<00:02:21.500> like<00:02:21.830> all<00:02:22.099> the

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
sized ships in the game like all the

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.830 
sized ships in the game like all the
multi-purpose<00:02:22.910> stuff<00:02:23.239> going<00:02:23.510> on<00:02:23.569> it's<00:02:23.780> a

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
multi-purpose stuff going on it's a

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.140 
multi-purpose stuff going on it's a
little<00:02:24.080> smaller<00:02:24.410> than<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:25.250> constellation

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
little smaller than the constellation

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.119 
little smaller than the constellation
but<00:02:26.750> like<00:02:26.930> I<00:02:27.049> said<00:02:27.110> I<00:02:27.319> think<00:02:27.500> it's<00:02:27.769> gonna<00:02:27.920> be<00:02:28.069> a

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
but like I said I think it's gonna be a

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.789 
but like I said I think it's gonna be a
pretty<00:02:28.340> fast<00:02:28.640> ship<00:02:29.049> the<00:02:30.049> Turner<00:02:30.349> surrounding

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
pretty fast ship the Turner surrounding

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.380 
pretty fast ship the Turner surrounding
ship<00:02:30.920> is<00:02:31.010> gonna<00:02:31.129> cover<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.610> whole<00:02:31.849> thing<00:02:31.879> like

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
ship is gonna cover the whole thing like

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.449 
ship is gonna cover the whole thing like
there's<00:02:32.569> no<00:02:32.690> blind<00:02:33.080> spots<00:02:33.230> you<00:02:34.069> could<00:02:34.220> carry

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
there's no blind spots you could carry

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.910

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
beautiful and then you're gonna have the

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.850 
beautiful and then you're gonna have the
multi-purpose<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.989> wings<00:02:45.410> you<00:02:45.560> could<00:02:45.709> change

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
multi-purpose the wings you could change

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.610 
multi-purpose the wings you could change
them<00:02:46.130> out<00:02:46.250> any<00:02:46.549> time<00:02:46.670> you<00:02:46.880> want<00:02:47.209> so<00:02:47.450> I<00:02:47.660> don't

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
this is a must-have in the hangar I

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.470 
this is a must-have in the hangar I
can't<00:02:52.310> wait<00:02:52.519> to<00:02:52.670> see<00:02:52.819> what<00:02:52.970> they<00:02:53.090> do<00:02:53.150> with<00:02:53.269> it

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480
