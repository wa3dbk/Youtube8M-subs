is<00:00:11.670> always<00:00:12.120> going<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.269> cast<00:00:12.509> as<00:00:12.719> win<00:00:12.929> wall

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
is always going to cast as win wall

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.839 
is always going to cast as win wall
you<00:00:13.590> pretty<00:00:13.740> much<00:00:13.830> cast<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.340> on<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.490> random

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849

player<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.570> spawns<00:00:15.929> on<00:00:16.139> them<00:00:16.289> then<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:16.590> creates

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
player it spawns on them then it creates

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.950 
player it spawns on them then it creates
a<00:00:17.070> rotating<00:00:17.580> wall<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:18.029> wind<00:00:18.300> as<00:00:18.510> you<00:00:18.539> guys<00:00:18.810> can

you're not next to it and if you are if
you<00:00:22.289> run<00:00:22.529> through<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:22.920> obviously<00:00:23.279> does

you run through it it obviously does

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.160 
you run through it it obviously does
damage<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.539> also<00:00:24.689> have<00:00:24.960> something

damage to you you also have something
called<00:00:25.260> four<00:00:25.650> winds<00:00:25.920> as<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.430> can<00:00:26.609> see<00:00:26.789> it

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
called four winds as you can see it

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.120 
called four winds as you can see it
sections<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.539> little<00:00:28.439> area<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:28.920> fight

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
sections the little area that you fight

sections the little area that you fight
them<00:00:29.250> out<00:00:29.369> into<00:00:29.699> four<00:00:29.730> different<00:00:30.000> sections

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
them out into four different sections

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.609 
them out into four different sections
make<00:00:30.689> sure<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.019> don't<00:00:31.199> run<00:00:31.320> through<00:00:31.529> the

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
make sure that you don't run through the

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.380 
make sure that you don't run through the
sections<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.130> does<00:00:32.279> damage<00:00:32.489> also<00:00:33.239> pay

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
sections it does damage also pay

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.000 
sections it does damage also pay
attention<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.780> where<00:00:33.930> they<00:00:34.050> spawn<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:34.829> is

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
attention to where they spawn this is

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.010 
attention to where they spawn this is
very<00:00:35.250> simple<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.790> easy<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.059> avoid<00:00:36.360> but<00:00:36.630> again

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
very simple and easy to avoid but again

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.569 
very simple and easy to avoid but again
if<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.500> do<00:00:37.680> run<00:00:37.860> through<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.250> does<00:00:38.399> do<00:00:38.550> a

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
if you do run through it it does do a

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.490 
if you do run through it it does do a
lot<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.790> damage<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.809> becomes<00:00:40.079> more<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.379> an

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
lot of damage and it becomes more of an

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.799 
lot of damage and it becomes more of an
issue<00:00:40.620> as<00:00:40.920> more<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.700> more<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.149> win<00:00:42.600> walls

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
issue as more and more of the win walls

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.380 
issue as more and more of the win walls
go<00:00:43.050> down<00:00:43.230> also<00:00:43.770> he<00:00:44.219> casts<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.610> lens<00:00:44.820> flare<00:00:45.090> and

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
go down also he casts a lens flare and

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.940 
go down also he casts a lens flare and
that's<00:00:45.780> just<00:00:45.989> basically<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.379> laser<00:00:46.620> that

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
that's just basically a laser that

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.830 
that's just basically a laser that
tracks<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.760> infects<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.180> random<00:00:48.510> person

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
tracks you and infects a random person

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.420 
tracks you and infects a random person
he<00:00:49.260> just<00:00:49.469> has<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> run<00:00:49.829> away<00:00:49.980> from<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.250> laser

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
he just has a run away from the laser

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.580 
he just has a run away from the laser
and<00:00:50.670> like<00:00:50.760> it's<00:00:50.910> real<00:00:51.090> simple<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:51.629> just<00:00:51.840> very

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
and like it's real simple it's just very

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.619 
and like it's real simple it's just very
very<00:00:52.770> easy<00:00:53.219> but<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.670> problem<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.149> obviously

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
very easy but the problem is obviously

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.150 
very easy but the problem is obviously
whenever<00:00:55.020> there's<00:00:55.230> more<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.590> more<00:00:55.680> stuff<00:00:56.039> on

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
whenever there's more and more stuff on

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.189 
whenever there's more and more stuff on
the<00:00:56.280> ground<00:00:56.489> he<00:00:56.699> casts<00:00:57.000> for<00:00:57.180> wins<00:00:57.390> again<00:00:57.719> and

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
the ground he casts for wins again and

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.420 
the ground he casts for wins again and
it<00:00:58.410> becomes<00:00:58.620> more<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:58.890> more<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.129> an<00:00:59.190> issues

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
it becomes more and more of an issues

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.099 
it becomes more and more of an issues
you<00:00:59.520> can<00:00:59.609> see<00:00:59.820> you<00:01:00.270> have<00:01:00.390> less<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.600> less<00:01:00.780> room

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
you can see you have less and less room

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.110 
you can see you have less and less room
to<00:01:01.260> move<00:01:01.379> around<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.820> kind<00:01:03.059> of

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
to move around and so this is kind of

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.000 
to move around and so this is kind of
like<00:01:03.329> basically<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.989> sheds<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.500> on<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.739> ground

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
like basically a sheds is on the ground

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.560 
like basically a sheds is on the ground
you<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.580> avoid<00:01:05.760> all<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.240> that's<00:01:06.390> on

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
you have to avoid all the that's on

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.719 
you have to avoid all the that's on
the<00:01:06.659> ground<00:01:06.689> fight<00:01:07.110> very<00:01:07.890> easy<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.340> do<00:01:08.400> he<00:01:08.610> also

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
the ground fight very easy to do he also

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.910 
the ground fight very easy to do he also
charges<00:01:09.299> two<00:01:09.450> random<00:01:09.810> players<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.409> look

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
charges two random players and you look

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.280 
charges two random players and you look
at<00:01:11.010> them<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.280> then<00:01:11.369> charge<00:01:11.900> it's<00:01:12.900> hard<00:01:13.140> to

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
at them and then charge it's hard to

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.899 
at them and then charge it's hard to
avoid<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.799> but<00:01:13.950> if<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.159> can<00:01:14.400> that's<00:01:14.670> good

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
avoid that but if you can that's good

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.100 
avoid that but if you can that's good
but<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.270> didn't<00:01:15.600> really<00:01:15.750> want<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:15.960> talk<00:01:16.049> about

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
but I didn't really want to talk about

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.420 
but I didn't really want to talk about
that<00:01:16.380> too<00:01:16.530> much<00:01:16.650> because<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.100> doesn't<00:01:17.340> really

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
that too much because it doesn't really

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
same thing basically as well as net just

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.680

if there's nobody in melee range and so

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.250
