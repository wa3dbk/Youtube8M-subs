month<00:00:18.630> back<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:19.500> don't<00:00:20.130> really<00:00:21.920> like<00:00:22.920> horse

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.269 
month back I don't really like horse
well<00:00:23.779> that's<00:00:24.779> not<00:00:24.930> true<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.380> like<00:00:25.650> horses<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:26.160> do

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
well that's not true I like horses I do

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.880 
well that's not true I like horses I do
I<00:00:26.609> don't<00:00:27.150> like<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.510> teeth<00:00:27.779> they're<00:00:28.590> weird

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
I don't like the teeth they're weird

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.009 
I don't like the teeth they're weird
they<00:00:29.130> look<00:00:29.310> like<00:00:29.429> human<00:00:29.789> teeth<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:30.840> thought

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
they look like human teeth so I thought

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.110 
they look like human teeth so I thought
the<00:00:31.470> best<00:00:31.500> way<00:00:31.859> for<00:00:32.130> me<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.250> get<00:00:32.430> over<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:32.850> is

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
the best way for me to get over this is

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.680 
the best way for me to get over this is
to<00:00:33.510> really<00:00:33.809> immerse<00:00:34.770> myself<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:36.210> I'm

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
to really immerse myself in it and I'm

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.690 
to really immerse myself in it and I'm
actually<00:00:36.870> reading<00:00:37.260> about<00:00:37.530> feeding<00:00:38.399> horses

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
actually reading about feeding horses

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.760 
actually reading about feeding horses
now<00:00:39.300> because<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.780> thought<00:00:39.930> okay<00:00:40.230> well<00:00:40.469> they<00:00:40.590> use

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
now because I thought okay well they use

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.799 
now because I thought okay well they use
their<00:00:40.980> teeth<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.430> chew<00:00:41.640> food<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.329> all<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.570> so

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
their teeth to chew food and all that so

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.920 
their teeth to chew food and all that so
I'm<00:00:43.500> going<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.710> get<00:00:43.860> over<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.870> feeding<00:00:45.870> a

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
I'm going to get over that feeding a

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.479 
I'm going to get over that feeding a
more<00:00:46.079> as<00:00:46.170> well<00:00:46.350> that's<00:00:46.500> that's<00:00:47.010> probably<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
more as well that's that's probably the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.049 
more as well that's that's probably the
key<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:48.079> I<00:00:49.079> guess<00:00:49.710> they<00:00:49.950> they<00:00:50.489> like<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> lot<00:00:50.969> of

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
key so I guess they they like a lot of

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.910 
key so I guess they they like a lot of
different<00:00:51.360> foods<00:00:51.660> they<00:00:52.469> like<00:00:52.649> something

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
different foods they like something

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.010 
different foods they like something
called<00:00:53.160> sugar<00:00:53.550> beet<00:00:53.850> which<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.360> byproduct

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
called sugar beet which is a byproduct

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.950 
called sugar beet which is a byproduct
of<00:00:55.320> sugar<00:00:55.620> which<00:00:56.340> comes<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:57.030> powder<00:00:57.329> shreds

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
of sugar which comes in powder shreds

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.709 
of sugar which comes in powder shreds
which<00:00:58.350> can<00:00:58.559> be<00:00:58.680> soaked<00:00:58.980> for<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.219> few<00:00:59.430> hours<00:00:59.719> and

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
which can be soaked for a few hours and

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.080 
which can be soaked for a few hours and
water<00:01:00.989> before<00:01:01.469> feeding<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:02.489> make<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.000> more

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
water before feeding to make it more

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.270 
water before feeding to make it more
palatable<00:01:03.239> it's<00:01:03.960> good<00:01:04.199> roughage<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.860> often

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
palatable it's good roughage and often

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.490 
palatable it's good roughage and often
