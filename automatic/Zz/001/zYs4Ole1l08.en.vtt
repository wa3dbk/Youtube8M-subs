00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
actually steroid hormones in your

actually steroid hormones in your
vitamin<00:00:58.469> list<00:00:58.649> like<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.829> vitamin<00:00:59.039> B<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.460> listed

vitamin list like a vitamin B you listed

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.790 
vitamin list like a vitamin B you listed
but<00:01:00.090> minerals<00:01:00.629> are<00:01:00.780> actually<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> much<00:01:01.559> bigger

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
but minerals are actually a much bigger

go<00:01:54.360> look<00:01:54.600> up<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.869> stuff<00:01:55.079> akin<00:01:55.409> long-term<00:01:56.040> it

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
go look up the stuff akin long-term it

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.440 
go look up the stuff akin long-term it
could<00:01:56.310> cause<00:01:56.460> organ<00:01:56.880> damage<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.329> other

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
could cause organ damage and other

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.889 
could cause organ damage and other
problems<00:01:57.869> but<00:01:58.110> d3<00:01:58.670> we've<00:01:59.670> never<00:01:59.880> seen<00:02:00.479> any

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
problems but d3 we've never seen any

problems but d3 we've never seen any
true<00:02:01.500> toxicity<00:02:02.100> exhibited<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.909> my<00:02:03.060> knowledge

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
true toxicity exhibited to my knowledge

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.780 
true toxicity exhibited to my knowledge
but<00:02:03.659> we<00:02:03.840> consider<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.500> safe<00:02:04.920> upper<00:02:05.520> threshold

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
but we consider the safe upper threshold

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.540 
but we consider the safe upper threshold
to<00:02:06.119> be<00:02:06.270> 10,000<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.079> eyes<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.259> day<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:08.369> could

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
to be 10,000 you eyes a day you could

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.430 
to be 10,000 you eyes a day you could
probably<00:02:08.819> go<00:02:09.270> above<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.869> but<00:02:10.229> there's

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
probably go above that but there's

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.140 
probably go above that but there's
probably<00:02:10.649> no<00:02:11.430> health<00:02:11.730> benefits<00:02:11.879> or<00:02:12.330> reason

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
probably no health benefits or reason

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.399 
probably no health benefits or reason
so<00:02:13.360> ever<00:02:13.540> other<00:02:13.750> than<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:14.049> want<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.260> throw

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:14.409 
so ever other than you want to throw

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:16.619 
so ever other than you want to throw
money<00:02:14.650> away<00:02:14.829> to<00:02:14.950> even<00:02:15.370> go<00:02:15.519> as<00:02:15.670> high<00:02:15.819> as<00:02:15.849> 10,000

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
money away to even go as high as 10,000

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.660 
money away to even go as high as 10,000
or<00:02:16.720> higher<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.709> there's<00:02:17.950> really<00:02:18.129> no<00:02:18.400> point

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
or higher so there's really no point

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.259 
or higher so there's really no point
