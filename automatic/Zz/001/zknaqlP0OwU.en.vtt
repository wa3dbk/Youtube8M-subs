00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.589
 he liked to say that he had done all 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.900
 these classics trying first at 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.599
 figurative world with still lifes and 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.490
 even to surrealism but from the 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.910
 second world war gerard schneider 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:23.220
 refines a style that will not leave him 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:25.859
 the abstraction of the powerful canvases of the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.939
 so-called action painting where the artist creates 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.719
 very spontaneously 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:36.270
 he applies these different colors 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:40.590
 with a brush gesture that is very 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.750
 very very lively between and fugitive is for 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.840
 him the question is not about 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.980
 represent something real but 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.850
 rather to bring out an emotion 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.670
 intense 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.769
 that he has inside himself and 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:01.440
 that he translates on to the canvas his 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.359
 memories his emotions his whole being and 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.129
 projected on the canvas a job or the 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.840
 shape the movement and especially the color 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.750
 have a primordial place 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.560
 I think it's a necessity because 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.049
 that she meets my taste the color he 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.600
 there is a wealth ya I see on the road 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.549
 dry can not defend me from whatever 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.350
 thing in me that produces me some 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:27.210
 effect this black brook she has with her 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.690
 force contained would be this 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.899
 discretion his sound taste of this slow I 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.179
 mean like tam-tam is not it a 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.440
 musical will of the touch that one 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:42.390
 found in the name of the works 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.390
 gerard schneider called all his

 Pictorial compositions by the name of chips 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.409
 as he would have done 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.719
 two pieces of music himself he 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.060
 must know is a musician and the 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:57.439
 pianists and works for 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.969
 hours of musical improvisation 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.890
 improvisations musical improvisation 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.319
 pictorial in total about fifty 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.030
 of works traces the course of this 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.099
 artist who first radiate to 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.110
 abroad before being one of the leaders of 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.110
 recognized file of abstraction in France
