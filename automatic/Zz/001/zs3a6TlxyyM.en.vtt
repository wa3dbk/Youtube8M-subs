I<00:01:59.159> i<00:01:59.189> I'm<00:01:59.729> aware<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.299> fact<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.890> the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
I i I'm aware of the fact that the

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.899 
I i I'm aware of the fact that the
person<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:02.850> changing

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
person is changing

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.730 
person is changing
and<00:02:04.149> it's<00:02:04.329> maturing<00:02:04.869> over<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.229> years<00:02:05.469> so<00:02:05.679> I

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
and it's maturing over the years so I

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.919 
and it's maturing over the years so I
guess<00:02:06.189> is<00:02:06.490> there's<00:02:06.819> no<00:02:06.999> difference<00:02:07.420> in<00:02:07.719> my

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
guess is there's no difference in my

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.930 
guess is there's no difference in my
example<00:02:08.470> you<00:02:09.190> know<00:02:09.310> over<00:02:09.519> the<00:02:09.640> years<00:02:09.670> I
