00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:15.840
 embroidered picture jel 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:20.640
 but did not think that I would try from crystals 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.820
 put from the same series from the picture 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.630
 cross stitched 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:29.400
 this set was a panel and he was the same 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.640
 bulk apples formed 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.570
 and was the same with strawberries him when i 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.340
 On the Chinese site I saw this set 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:42.810
 crystals need a lot 1 means in topic 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:47.040
 I will try to make the same one 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:51.660
 crystals do not work very large 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:56.010
 there will be such a big picture 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:03:00.080
 It turns out in the end of course this is completely 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.080
 I did not expect that inside is so big 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.970
 so marked all 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:22.439
