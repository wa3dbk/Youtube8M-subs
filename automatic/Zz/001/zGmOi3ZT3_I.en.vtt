00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:05.590
 6 2 for clues 2 three daughters 

00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:10.190
 in January 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.429
 this Friday at the hospital added to counter the fall 

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:16.409
 The models 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:19.409
 3 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.560
 the mode of operation of the simple system consists of reactivating has programmed 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.060
 mazatlan humala 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.090
 at this time we are going from the code major manufacturer supplement 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.800
 they pointed 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.680
 control of the threshold plan 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.680
 cappa 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.450
 next we describe the characteristics that contain both 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.380
 teams 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.360
 More than a million combinations available 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.989
 memorize up to six codes one master and five user 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.000
 overlay keyboard with light indicators 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.300
 There is no limit on the number of systems and install 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.660
 emergency exit button 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.260
 anti-vandalism operation mode 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.960
 auxiliary output of 12 volts a hamster 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.930
 and low current consumption 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.510
 Investment recommendations of 1 100 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.730
 the foreign trade keyboard along with the members of the same side with 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.920
 venezuela by 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.430
 the wall is perforated to pass the calendar where they will have 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.970
 placed the health switch close in a report the adapter in a 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.460
 plug 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.810
 the one in the region is very simple 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.990
 according to hernando siles for each food with the end of December 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.210
 let's do a hands-code programming 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.850
 which is very simple 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.740
 first let's show the opening of the door with the code killed by factory 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.709
 that this plan 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.049
 followed by the win 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.049
 Rivera the head of state 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.359
 now we will eat by a new master code that we have assigned by the number 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:26.889
 1 2 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:28.869
 let's start with programming 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:30.449
 we would have then 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:32.199
 do and how 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:35.289
 0 that this factory master code 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:37.419
 acer iconia 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:38.869
 0 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:40.169
 asterisk 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:43.559
 the assigned number 

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:45.149
 4 

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:46.669
 asterisk 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:50.449
 and at this moment we have the option to declare 1 if we want the people 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:52.949
 teacher has the sheet or talk 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:55.949
 otegi ardoz is required to activate the output of syria 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:59.539
 we need to advance the functions 

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:02.879
 lunch 1 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:04.439
 asterisk 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:07.439
 but name them 

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:12.569
 for the release of the code our governed to type this fire the 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.199
 i mean 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:16.989
 1 two three four 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.479
 rivera 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:21.479
 jajajajajajajajajajajaja 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.969
 in this way programmed for the moment we have not come to see with the increase of 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:31.969
 unemployment 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.959
 the programming of the user code is done the following year 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:50.289
 asterisk 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:53.229
 more than the programmed master code 

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:56.269
 the producers 4 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.099
 click on and 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.099
 more than the number of users starting with 1 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:03.789
 asterisk 

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:08.089
 the user code that can be part of six appointments as an example ponce 

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:11.089
 22 33 

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:13.619
 asterisk 

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:18.519
 the user song a useful to activate it plywood two feet 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.270
 to activate them speed offers to activate both functions in this case of 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.789
 Carlos CuarÃ³n 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.240
 harrison 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.680
 inhuman 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.840
 and ready 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.600
 to verify this user programming about 20 years in code that 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.930
 we program 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.669
 11 to 22 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:37.729
 33 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:39.520
 valverde carlos melara 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.050
 during the Guadalajara holidays 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.050
 Hahaha 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.999
 the programming of the crimes of deprivation of chaco with gusts as well as 

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:59.139
 of the evidence are similar 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:01.340
 for this you must ask for forgiveness 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.749
 plus the master code programmed about 2 3 and 4 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.559
 asterisks 

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:10.689
 and now we have to print hands saying that the activation of 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:15.589
 plywood number seven scepters of stridency we fulfill in this case 6 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.860
 Likewise 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.550
 now the time range is programmed which is the second time in two figures 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.099
 we fulfill 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:25.129
 4 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:28.569
 before the national team 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:31.779
 we are going to come and that to the programming of four seconds of the second stage 

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:32.879
 we fulfill 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:34.539
 1 2 3 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:36.729
 4 magna 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:39.729
 we can reread 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:44.750
 of the activation of the congress as of 2011 world departe the laying of 

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:47.749
 the activation of the evidences 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:03.069
 on the other hand on the same Friday the chairman of the commission 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:05.869
 activities that may well have an access code 

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:07.469
 the program in this way 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:09.629
 you type asterisk 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:12.710
 master code 1 two three four 

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:16.749
 verizon com 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.409
 asterisk 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:24.909
 at this time we made an option b with the menemismo ferrÃ¡n 3 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:29.650
 whose function is unprecedented in keyboards for a minute in 2000 suddenly 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:33.289
 asterisk 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:39.099
 to check how the vandalism model works we will have four codes 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:40.969
 wrong as an example 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:42.610
 1 doctors 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.189
 berlin 

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:47.189
 4 5 6 mercy 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.770
 7 by montmelÃ³ 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.539
 2 5 others 

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:56.449
 that does not depend on me anymore 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:59.419
 being completely unpublished keyboard 

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:00.610
 and even after it
