00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.190 
thomas / j such a unique personality and
do<00:01:36.580> you<00:01:36.640> remember<00:01:36.729> two<00:01:37.119> years<00:01:37.149> ago<00:01:37.479> he<00:01:37.690> felt

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
do you remember two years ago he felt

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.600 
do you remember two years ago he felt
like<00:01:38.289> he<00:01:38.619> was<00:01:38.740> probably<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:39.159> best<00:01:39.369> in<00:01:39.520> the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
like he was probably the best in the

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.270 
like he was probably the best in the
world<00:01:39.759> and<00:01:40.030> and<00:01:40.659> i<00:01:40.840> would<00:01:40.990> claim<00:01:41.229> maybe<00:01:41.860> he<00:01:42.069> was

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
world and and i would claim maybe he was

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.520 
world and and i would claim maybe he was
but<00:01:42.610> he<00:01:42.789> never<00:01:43.149> got<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.600> credit<00:01:43.630> he<00:01:44.110> deserved

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
but he never got the credit he deserved

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.649 
but he never got the credit he deserved
yeah<00:01:45.250> i<00:01:45.280> think<00:01:45.549> he<00:01:45.729> felt<00:01:45.940> the<00:01:46.060> same<00:01:46.240> way<00:01:46.420> and<00:01:46.600> he

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
yeah i think he felt the same way and he

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.120 
yeah i think he felt the same way and he
kind<00:01:46.899> of<00:01:46.960> came<00:01:47.110> to<00:01:47.259> a<00:01:47.289> point<00:01:47.560> where<00:01:47.679> he<00:01:47.830> stopped

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
kind of came to a point where he stopped

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.370 
kind of came to a point where he stopped
flipping<00:01:48.580> his<00:01:48.670> bike<00:01:48.880> and<00:01:49.149> it's<00:01:49.869> so<00:01:50.110> weird

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
flipping his bike and it's so weird

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.139 
flipping his bike and it's so weird
because<00:01:50.560> he<00:01:50.709> was<00:01:50.920> such<00:01:51.100> a<00:01:51.159> natural<00:01:51.429> at<00:01:51.819> it<00:01:51.850> that

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
because he was such a natural at it that
