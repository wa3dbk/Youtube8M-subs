00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.120
 protein synthesis is the process 

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:10.480
 by which the information contained in the 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.150
 dna and transcribed in the rna messenger 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.700
 is translated into the specific sequence 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.920
 of amino acids of a baby octopus chain 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.920
 tell 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:24.840
 protein synthesis requires in addition to 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:29.080
 rna messenger two other types of rna rna 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:34.150
 ribosomal and transport 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:36.180
 rna ribosomial or rrn a is contained in 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.000
 ribosomes 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.000
 ribosomes consist of a sub 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.180
 minor unit that links the rna messenger 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.900
 and from a major sub unit that has the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.739
 site of protein synthesis rna of 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:55.680
 transport or rna consists of approx 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:00.540
 80 core TV and has a feature 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:04.449
 trefoil shape the trn a ha la 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.700
 function of transporting amino acids 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.329
 the cells contain more than twenty 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.090
 rna molecules at least one for each 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:15.820
 of the different amino acids 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.630
 the green colored nucleotides are 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:24.610
 equal in all trn while others 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:28.300
 vary depending on the particular trn a 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.120
 the nucleotide chain of trn a ends 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.430
 always with a sequence cca near the 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.150
 its end 3 first 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.210
 this is the site where the trn a binds 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.520
 to its specific amino acid 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.670
 a second recognition site of the 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.190
 trn a is on the opposite side of the 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.159
 three-dimensional structure on one of the 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.920
 arms of the molecule this site is 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.810
 consisting of three nucleotides that form 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.600
 an ancient gifts 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.110
 each anti-codon is complementary to one 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.450
 specific codon of the year for 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.709
 simplicity in the next sequences il 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.420
 trn a will be schematized thus the first 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.849
 stage of translation 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.550
 the beginning begins when the sub unit 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:20.390
 minor of the ribosome attaches to 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:23.510
 mrna filament at the ends 5 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.739
 first highlighting the first 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:30.410
 codon the t rna that bears the first 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:34.250
 amino acid generally provides theo 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:37.370
 nina binds to mrna in correspondence 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.580
 of the codon of beginning of the translation a 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.880
 today found on the site p of the 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.880
 ribosome 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:51.120
 in action between the minor unit of the 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:53.610
 ribosome mrna and trn at the beginning is called 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.130
 start complex 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:00.710
 at this point the major sub unit of the 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.710
 ribosome attaches to the minor one 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.210
 thus begins the second phase of the 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:09.960
 translation lengthening 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:12.630
 a second trn a goes to occupy the site a 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.740
 of the ribosome at the 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:19.860
 second codon present on the mrna 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:23.280
 the amino acid attached to this trn a si 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.040
 binds to the lower acid with matt 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.860
 peptide bond the necessary energy 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.380
 for the formation of this link is 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:36.000
 provided by the hydrolysis of the nucleotide 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:39.780
 guano dinner triphosphate gtp in gdp e 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.550
 phosphate later the ribosome flows into 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:48.570
 ahead of a long tail ron messenger 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.670
 the first trn a moves to the site ee 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.390
 is released 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.480
 the second trn to which they are now attached 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.550
 the first two amino acids pass through the site a 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.739
 to the site p 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:05.730
 with the site has again released the 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:08.100
 ribosoma welcomes a new trn a and the 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.959
 elongation process is repeated in 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.069
 so as to translate the entire sequence 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.709
 written in mrna 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:19.280
 when the ribosome meets the codon of 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:22.610
 stop on the mrna is at the stop of the 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:26.330
 translation because at the stop codon not 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:29.300
 corresponds some trn to the site to yes 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.470
 inserts a protein called factor 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.290
 release 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.660
 the translation at the end of the chain 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:41.180
 baby octopus just formed comes 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.180
 removed and the two sub unitary bosses
