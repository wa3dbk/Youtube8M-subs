00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.080 

see<00:02:52.860> now<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.069> control<00:02:53.400> panel<00:02:53.640> is<00:02:53.700> not<00:02:53.790> usable

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
see now the control panel is not usable

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.990 
see now the control panel is not usable
once<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.930> elevator<00:02:55.260> leaves<00:02:55.560> it's<00:02:55.920> not<00:02:56.160> usable

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.020 

it's<00:03:00.000> up<00:03:00.090> there<00:03:00.269> I<00:03:01.640> don't<00:03:02.640> want<00:03:02.849> any<00:03:03.000> stay<00:03:03.989> away

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
it's up there I don't want any stay away

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.119 
it's up there I don't want any stay away
all<00:03:06.030> right<00:03:06.209> guys<00:03:06.360> this<00:03:07.170> was<00:03:07.349> a<00:03:07.379> very<00:03:07.560> short<00:03:07.980> one

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
all right guys this was a very short one

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.430 
all right guys this was a very short one
there<00:03:08.340> was<00:03:08.430> just<00:03:08.640> two<00:03:09.569> myths<00:03:09.810> someone<00:03:10.230> to<00:03:10.290> put

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
there was just two myths someone to put

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.910 
there was just two myths someone to put
to<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.620> test<00:03:10.830> getting<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.760> grenade<00:03:12.060> in<00:03:12.239> I

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
to the test getting the grenade in I

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.410 
to the test getting the grenade in I
don't<00:03:13.920> see<00:03:14.250> why<00:03:14.519> that<00:03:14.550> would<00:03:14.849> have<00:03:15.090> anything

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
don't see why that would have anything

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.039 
don't see why that would have anything
to<00:03:15.720> do<00:03:15.870> with<00:03:16.130> anything<00:03:17.810> that<00:03:18.810> just<00:03:18.989> doesn't

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
to do with anything that just doesn't

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.770 
to do with anything that just doesn't
make<00:03:19.230> sense<00:03:19.340> i<00:03:20.340> guess<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.269> theory<00:03:21.450> behind<00:03:21.599> it

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
make sense i guess the theory behind it

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.990 
make sense i guess the theory behind it
could<00:03:21.930> be<00:03:22.019> if<00:03:22.140> he<00:03:22.230> hit<00:03:22.319> the<00:03:22.440> perk<00:03:22.620> machine<00:03:23.000> but

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
could be if he hit the perk machine but

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.740 
could be if he hit the perk machine but
uh<00:03:24.030> no<00:03:24.900> i<00:03:24.930> don't<00:03:25.290> think<00:03:25.319> so<00:03:25.549> so<00:03:26.599> maybe<00:03:27.599> i'll

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
uh no i don't think so so maybe i'll

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.720 
uh no i don't think so so maybe i'll
test<00:03:27.930> that<00:03:28.049> one<00:03:28.140> later<00:03:28.290> but<00:03:28.680> for<00:03:28.920> this<00:03:29.010> one<00:03:29.250> you

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
test that one later but for this one you

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.910 
test that one later but for this one you
cannot<00:03:30.000> stop<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:30.480> elevator<00:03:30.569> with<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:30.959> key<00:03:31.230> wow

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
cannot stop the elevator with a key wow

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.990 
cannot stop the elevator with a key wow
the<00:03:31.980> elevator<00:03:32.640> is<00:03:32.940> leaving<00:03:33.840> so<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.910> idea

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
the elevator is leaving so the idea

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.350 
the elevator is leaving so the idea
behind<00:03:37.430> calling<00:03:38.430> an<00:03:38.549> elevator<00:03:38.940> when<00:03:39.239> your

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
behind calling an elevator when your

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.259 
behind calling an elevator when your
teammates<00:03:39.720> are<00:03:39.959> going<00:03:40.260> up<00:03:41.120> doesn't<00:03:42.120> seem<00:03:42.180> like

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
teammates are going up doesn't seem like

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.979 
teammates are going up doesn't seem like
it's<00:03:42.510> gonna<00:03:42.630> work<00:03:42.840> because<00:03:43.790> you<00:03:44.790> can't<00:03:45.060> call

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
it's gonna work because you can't call

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.430 
it's gonna work because you can't call
it<00:03:46.110> up<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.440> thing<00:03:46.739> becomes<00:03:46.980> unaccessible<00:03:47.519> um

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
it up the thing becomes unaccessible um

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.190 
it up the thing becomes unaccessible um
I'm<00:03:49.440> thinking<00:03:49.829> maybe<00:03:50.480> if<00:03:51.480> there<00:03:51.780> was<00:03:51.870> a<00:03:51.900> way<00:03:51.989> to

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
I'm thinking maybe if there was a way to

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.550 
I'm thinking maybe if there was a way to
call<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.829> up<00:03:52.920> stop<00:03:53.670> it<00:03:53.849> if<00:03:54.810> your<00:03:54.989> team<00:03:55.170> were<00:03:55.440> to

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
call the up stop it if your team were to

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.780 
call the up stop it if your team were to
fall<00:03:55.799> down<00:03:55.910> well<00:03:56.910> you<00:03:57.180> were<00:03:57.739> downstairs<00:03:58.790> and

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
fall down well you were downstairs and

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.220 
fall down well you were downstairs and
your<00:03:59.940> to<00:04:00.030> put<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.209> key<00:04:00.389> in<00:04:00.569> while<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.780> team<00:04:01.109> is

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
your to put the key in while the team is

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.530 
your to put the key in while the team is
falling<00:04:01.530> it<00:04:01.920> might<00:04:02.100> work<00:04:02.280> however<00:04:02.790> in<00:04:03.359> order

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
falling it might work however in order

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.660 
falling it might work however in order
for<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.810> elevator<00:04:03.989> to<00:04:04.200> fall<00:04:04.470> it<00:04:05.250> seems<00:04:05.549> that

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
for the elevator to fall it seems that

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.370 
for the elevator to fall it seems that
all<00:04:05.850> teammates<00:04:06.150> must<00:04:06.569> be<00:04:06.690> inside<00:04:07.109> of<00:04:07.139> the

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
all teammates must be inside of the

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.009 
all teammates must be inside of the
elevator<00:04:07.709> so<00:04:08.130> I'm<00:04:09.060> going<00:04:09.239> to<00:04:09.299> call<00:04:09.540> this<00:04:09.690> video
