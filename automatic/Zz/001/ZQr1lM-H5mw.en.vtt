so<00:00:18.570> we<00:00:18.690> identified<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.530> often<00:00:19.950> happens<00:00:20.220> this

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
so we identified it often happens this

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.670 
so we identified it often happens this
way<00:00:20.460> but<00:00:20.610> we<00:00:20.670> identified<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.750> lot<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.500> the

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
way but we identified a lot of the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.160 
way but we identified a lot of the
students<00:00:23.400> in<00:00:24.090> year<00:00:24.210> 7<00:00:24.360> who<00:00:24.660> were<00:00:24.780> requiring

help<00:00:28.610> whether<00:00:29.610> it<00:00:29.760> be<00:00:29.970> their<00:00:30.210> classwork<00:00:30.480> or

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
help whether it be their classwork or

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.110 
help whether it be their classwork or
behavior<00:00:31.470> or<00:00:31.590> homework<00:00:31.830> has<00:00:32.430> also<00:00:32.700> been<00:00:32.940> those

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
behavior or homework has also been those

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.479 
behavior or homework has also been those
in<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.330> football<00:00:33.630> team<00:00:34.010> and<00:00:35.010> we<00:00:35.160> would<00:00:35.340> try

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
in the football team and we would try

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.220 
in the football team and we would try
thinking<00:00:35.820> ways<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.270> engage<00:00:36.420> them<00:00:36.930> through

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
thinking ways to engage them through

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.380 
thinking ways to engage them through
football<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.670> knew<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:38.910> fully<00:00:39.239> on

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
football and I knew that fully on

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.840 
football and I knew that fully on
borders<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.440> what<00:00:40.620> they<00:00:40.739> did<00:00:40.800> they<00:00:41.760> have

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
borders this is what they did they have

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.729 
borders this is what they did they have
a<00:00:41.910> track<00:00:42.120> record<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.449> doing<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:42.809> thought<00:00:43.500> get

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
a track record of doing this thought get

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.410 
a track record of doing this thought get
them<00:00:43.890> then<00:00:44.070> see<00:00:44.460> what<00:00:44.610> ideas<00:00:44.730> they<00:00:44.940> have<00:00:45.210> about

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
them then see what ideas they have about

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.270 
them then see what ideas they have about
how<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.660> engage<00:00:45.960> them<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.410> improve<00:00:46.949> other

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
how to engage them to improve other

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.830 
how to engage them to improve other
areas<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.760> their<00:00:48.059> school<00:00:48.300> life<00:00:48.480> because<00:00:48.750> they

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
areas of their school life because they

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.840 
areas of their school life because they
were<00:00:48.930> very<00:00:49.170> engaged<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.680> football<00:00:50.100> but<00:00:50.550> not<00:00:50.699> so

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
were very engaged in football but not so

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.549 
were very engaged in football but not so
much<00:00:50.970> in<00:00:51.150> the<00:00:51.269> other<00:00:51.420> areas<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.350> thought

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
much in the other areas so we thought

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.810 
much in the other areas so we thought
that<00:00:52.800> they<00:00:53.100> might<00:00:53.280> be<00:00:53.400> the<00:00:53.460> ideal

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
that they might be the ideal

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.920 
that they might be the ideal
organization<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.659> cross<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.199> boundary<00:00:56.930> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
organization to cross that boundary the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.899 
organization to cross that boundary the
idea<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.290> to<00:00:58.350> reward<00:00:58.589> them<00:00:59.070> with<00:00:59.610> a<00:00:59.670> football

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
idea is to reward them with a football

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.479 
idea is to reward them with a football
toward<00:01:00.239> Scotland<00:01:00.750> we<00:01:01.650> want<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.010> take<00:01:02.250> them<00:01:02.400> out

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
toward Scotland we want to take them out

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.850 
toward Scotland we want to take them out
of<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.790> school<00:01:03.000> context<00:01:03.659> give<00:01:04.620> them<00:01:04.769> an

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
of the school context give them an

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.320 
of the school context give them an
opportunity<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.400> have<00:01:05.519> something<00:01:05.760> really<00:01:06.240> fun

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
opportunity to have something really fun

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.360 
opportunity to have something really fun
but<00:01:06.659> also<00:01:06.750> enriching<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.890> chance<00:01:08.130> for<00:01:08.310> us

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
but also enriching and a chance for us

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.070
