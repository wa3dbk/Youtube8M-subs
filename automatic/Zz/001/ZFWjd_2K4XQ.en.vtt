00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
collection since you can illustrate a

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.559 
collection since you can illustrate a
fight<00:02:39.159> every<00:02:39.280> night<00:02:39.730> socio<00:02:40.060> straight<00:02:40.360> to<00:02:40.480> the

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
fight every night socio straight to the

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.289 
fight every night socio straight to the
collection<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.200> so<00:02:41.920> in<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.670> our<00:02:42.819> team<00:02:43.090> got

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
collection and so in the our team got

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.119 
collection and so in the our team got
together<00:02:43.480> and<00:02:43.989> we<00:02:44.530> kind<00:02:44.709> of<00:02:44.769> plant<00:02:45.040> a

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
together and we kind of plant a

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.149 
together and we kind of plant a
collection<00:02:45.519> that<00:02:45.549> would<00:02:45.879> be<00:02:46.769> inspired<00:02:47.769> by<00:02:47.829> her

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 
collection that would be inspired by her

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:49.770 
collection that would be inspired by her
own<00:02:48.400> style<00:02:48.670> because<00:02:49.000> I<00:02:49.150> think<00:02:49.390> her<00:02:49.540> style

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
own style because I think her style

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.539 
own style because I think her style
really<00:02:49.989> suits<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.500> image<00:02:50.799> of<00:02:50.890> mud<00:02:51.069> dolly<00:02:51.280> and

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
really suits the image of mud dolly and

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.729 
really suits the image of mud dolly and
she<00:02:52.390> did<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.599> collection<00:02:52.930> of<00:02:52.989> drawings<00:02:53.200> well<00:02:53.709> I

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
she did a collection of drawings well I

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.530 
she did a collection of drawings well I
designed<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.129> dresses<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:55.239> she<00:02:55.420> also

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
designed the dresses and she also

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.710 
designed the dresses and she also
modeled<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:55.959> collection<00:02:56.379> so<00:02:57.159> that's

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
modeled the collection so that's

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.059 
modeled the collection so that's

mod<00:03:05.230> trend<00:03:05.560> because<00:03:06.120> because<00:03:07.120> it's<00:03:07.299> called

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
mod trend because because it's called

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.970 
mod trend because because it's called
mob<00:03:07.750> dolly<00:03:07.989> I<00:03:08.139> think<00:03:08.379> it<00:03:08.470> would<00:03:08.590> be<00:03:08.620> sleeve<00:03:08.889> I

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.319 
mob dolly I think it would be sleeve I
didn't<00:03:09.190> really<00:03:09.280> work<00:03:09.489> with<00:03:09.579> that<00:03:09.730> chance<00:03:09.970> and

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
didn't really work with that chance and

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.210 
didn't really work with that chance and
