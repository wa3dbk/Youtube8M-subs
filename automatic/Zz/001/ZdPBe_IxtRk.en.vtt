00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.460
 many do not believe in the results of m with 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.099
 training his call is ours since this 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.379
 unusual product concept this we do not 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.539
 do nothing else but use 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.400
 body effects behind us 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.619
 precisely and every muscle 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.830
 daily stimulated by electric them 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.930
 same site and we are doing even this one 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.060
 effect we use enhancing it 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.369
 minor external fashi electric 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.690
 impulses from resulting training 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.210
 bring more effect and 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:42.930
 the practitioner is faster than his 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:44.040
 goals of individuals and even years works as follows 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.410
 way he himself 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:54.649
 electrical impulse passes through these 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.649
 wires go down yes yes that way 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:04.900
 Now tighten the belt a little jacket well 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.989
 straining muscles 20 minutes takes a lot 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.989
 effort 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.490
 and 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.740
 at the end of 20 minutes requires a lot of effort 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.850
 the goals of the leaders for which you must pay 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.040
 as before the independent plug but 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.530
 while our technology does everything 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.360
 possible for you to reach a step 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.070
 possible more power remember see 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.550
 what about this sport says 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.520
 the medicine 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.260
 street used during amos training 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.450
 represents nothing new from the point 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.610
 view of sports medicine he has long been 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.450
 applied this way it is about 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.160
 so-called 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.520
 electro stimulate their workouts 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.690
 which are also called abbreviated 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.700
 the effectiveness of this training method 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.500
 uniquely proven by many 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.119
 research including 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.100
 sports street then cologne 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.440
 what is new now she once 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.360
 that using m with workouts this view 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.650
 Occupation became available to the masses 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.410
 . 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.300
 m success with training is not based 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.310
 only on innovative technology but 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.380
 also on intensive accompaniment 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.000
 personal instructor came what 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.980
 another center might offer something 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.930
 like one of the most important 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.910
 the benefits are just joint 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.140
 work with a coach on their problems 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.239
 joint meeting 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.760
 it is this intense personal 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.980
 accompaniment convicts m with a workout in 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.709
 our field uniform size from others 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.430
 disintegrated cried for phenomenon from orbit 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.430
 fries 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.980
 who is engaged in simulators then gets 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:55.290
 bystryuk urban pms by 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.390
 power plants are down 90 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.430
 percent music called him and 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.659
 significant intense compared to 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.760
 regular training 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:05.010
 so do not even moved 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.349
 engaged in may for several 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.200
 weeks to reach noticeable whether not measurable 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:13.530
 power zion for example reducing fat 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.730
 in the body at 1525 process or 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.200
 waist reduction of 35 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.239
 perfect figure without traditional and 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.160
 training disciplines what are you now 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.250
 can say 20 minutes is enough 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.470
 20 minutes is definitely enough at the beginning I 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.230
 was a bit skeptical but 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.810
 I now have 3 centimeters further 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.299
 and this after 12 weeks what more 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.930
 never really you do what 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.930
 promise
