what<00:02:35.750> we<00:02:35.900> started<00:02:36.349> with<00:02:36.410> here<00:02:37.209> it's<00:02:38.209> important

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
what we started with here it's important

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.210 
what we started with here it's important
that<00:02:38.900> we<00:02:38.989> get<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.230> literal<00:02:39.620> spiritual

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
that we get the literal spiritual

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.610 
that we get the literal spiritual
interpretations<00:02:41.030> here<00:02:41.390> but<00:02:41.870> how<00:02:42.110> do<00:02:42.170> we<00:02:42.409> do

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
interpretations here but how do we do

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.369 
interpretations here but how do we do
that<00:02:43.420> you're<00:02:44.420> Peter<00:02:44.660> says<00:02:44.959> we're<00:02:45.200> going<00:02:45.319> to

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
watch out and we do it individually so

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.259 
watch out and we do it individually so
how<00:02:49.970> should<00:02:50.329> we<00:02:50.859> read<00:02:51.859> scripture<00:02:52.459> and<00:02:52.730> come<00:02:53.150> to

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
how should we read scripture and come to

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.569 
how should we read scripture and come to
that<00:02:53.390> interpretation<00:02:53.989> to<00:02:54.319> get<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:55.099> correct

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
that interpretation to get the correct

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.089 
that interpretation to get the correct
interpretation<00:02:55.930> among<00:02:56.930> when<00:02:57.560> you<00:02:57.650> say<00:02:57.799> twenty

did the author intend to say not what we

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.710 
did the author intend to say not what we
think<00:05:31.740> he<00:05:31.979> should<00:05:32.340> have<00:05:32.490> said<00:05:32.729> but<00:05:32.970> and<00:05:33.210> that's

think he should have said but and that's
a<00:05:33.810> tough<00:05:34.020> one<00:05:34.290> sometimes<00:05:34.800> it<00:05:35.729> really<00:05:35.880> is<00:05:36.180> oh

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
a tough one sometimes it really is oh

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
this is for babies are probably run into

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.080 
this is for babies are probably run into
between<00:05:40.250> fundamentalists<00:05:41.250> a<00:05:41.430> nice<00:05:41.610> of<00:05:41.820> him

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
between fundamentalists a nice of him

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.200 
between fundamentalists a nice of him
like<00:05:42.600> the<00:05:42.810> interpretation<00:05:43.710> of<00:05:44.280> the<00:05:44.520> first

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
like the interpretation of the first

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.020 
like the interpretation of the first
book<00:05:45.419> of<00:05:45.570> Genesis<00:05:46.110> will<00:05:46.320> create<00:05:47.030> they're

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
book of Genesis will create they're

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.300 
book of Genesis will create they're
convinced<00:05:48.450> that<00:05:48.600> happened<00:05:49.139> seven<00:05:49.560> days<00:05:49.890> yeah

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
convinced that happened seven days yeah

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.310 
convinced that happened seven days yeah
yeah<00:05:50.520> there's<00:05:50.729> a<00:05:50.820> perfect<00:05:51.210> example<00:05:51.360> you<00:05:52.200> know

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
yeah there's a perfect example you know

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.010 
yeah there's a perfect example you know
we<00:05:52.440> studied<00:05:52.770> this<00:05:52.860> in<00:05:53.039> Genesis<00:05:53.550> God<00:05:54.330> created

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
we studied this in Genesis God created

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.240 
we studied this in Genesis God created
in<00:05:55.169> the<00:05:55.260> first<00:05:55.289> day<00:05:55.620> second<00:05:55.919> day<00:05:55.979> third<00:05:56.070> day

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
in the first day second day third day

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.930 
in the first day second day third day
forth<00:05:56.610> a<00:05:56.760> 56-day<00:05:57.600> right<00:05:57.840> so<00:05:58.760> scripture<00:05:59.760> says

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
forth a 56-day right so scripture says

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.969 
forth a 56-day right so scripture says
he<00:06:00.150> created<00:06:00.539> in<00:06:00.690> six<00:06:00.930> days<00:06:01.050> so<00:06:01.470> therefore<00:06:01.830> God

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:01.979 
he created in six days so therefore God

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:04.250 
he created in six days so therefore God
created<00:06:02.400> the<00:06:02.490> earth<00:06:02.520> in<00:06:02.760> six<00:06:02.940> days<00:06:03.140> you<00:06:04.140> know

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 
created the earth in six days you know

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.950 
created the earth in six days you know
that's<00:06:04.740> the<00:06:04.979> fundamentalist<00:06:05.760> way<00:06:06.479> of<00:06:06.630> looking

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
that's the fundamentalist way of looking

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.180 
that's the fundamentalist way of looking

few paragraphs before daddy did they
were<00:06:30.450> questioning<00:06:31.080> his<00:06:31.260> ability<00:06:31.410> to<00:06:31.950> do<00:06:32.130> this

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
were questioning his ability to do this

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.870 
were questioning his ability to do this
and<00:06:33.300> he<00:06:33.540> said<00:06:33.570> well<00:06:34.020> I<00:06:34.380> have<00:06:35.130> fought<00:06:35.520> and

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 
and he said well I have fought and

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:45.260 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.500 

maybe<00:06:45.860> that's<00:06:46.490> what<00:06:46.610> you<00:06:46.760> have<00:06:46.910> to<00:06:46.940> look<00:06:47.120> into

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:47.510 
maybe that's what you have to look into

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.190 
maybe that's what you have to look into
and<00:06:48.500> I'm<00:06:48.980> trying<00:06:49.250> to<00:06:49.310> get<00:06:49.460> a<00:06:49.490> literal

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:50.200 
and I'm trying to get a literal

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.000 
and I'm trying to get a literal
interpretation<00:06:51.200> of<00:06:51.290> Scripture<00:06:51.710> can<00:06:51.860> get

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010 
interpretation of Scripture can get

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.850 
interpretation of Scripture can get
really<00:06:52.310> tough<00:06:52.670> at<00:06:52.880> times<00:06:53.500> you<00:06:54.500> know<00:06:54.560> it<00:06:54.710> takes

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:54.860 
really tough at times you know it takes

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.610 
really tough at times you know it takes
it<00:06:55.310> takes<00:06:55.340> a<00:06:55.610> lot<00:06:55.760> of<00:06:55.790> work<00:06:56.260> you<00:06:57.260> know<00:06:57.350> we<00:06:57.500> just

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:57.620 
it takes a lot of work you know we just

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.260 
it takes a lot of work you know we just
can't<00:06:57.860> just<00:06:58.040> read<00:06:58.280> a<00:06:58.310> word<00:06:58.550> and<00:06:58.760> dis<00:06:58.880> assume

00:06:59.260 --> 00:06:59.270 
can't just read a word and dis assume

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.450 
can't just read a word and dis assume
that<00:06:59.540> we<00:07:00.230> know<00:07:00.260> what<00:07:00.530> it<00:07:00.620> means<00:07:00.800> it<00:07:01.010> takes<00:07:01.070> some

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:01.460 
that we know what it means it takes some

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.200 
that we know what it means it takes some
work<00:07:01.670> so<00:07:02.060> that's<00:07:02.510> the<00:07:02.630> point<00:07:02.870> of<00:07:03.020> this
