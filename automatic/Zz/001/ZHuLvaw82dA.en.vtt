00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.830
 new video 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.050
 the first episode of a series that you 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.360
 many have asked me 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.890
 division 1 with valves so the concept 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.690
 is simple guys we'll play the 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.070
 division 1 I did not want to divide 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.239
 19 million 8 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.829
 because that's where everyone does it 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.120
 I want to make you just 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.770
 division I want to say you see 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.690
 we all go for the hunt division 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.670
 voice for the denouement for orgasm 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.230
 for the end of the film you see if that 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.789
 wait I guess you want to be there 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.480
 go because you are the skin of fifa 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:51.480
 so let's go 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.360
 and yes I know I pulled out the heavy 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.640
 artillery the crazy thing kids a 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.520
 heavy team honda Grizzly Man was the 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.950
 rib and a queen of pop had to matuidi from 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.540
 clichy ah not clichÃ© 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.979
 besides, many of you 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.619
 chamber because I scored a blow 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.880
 frank with clichy and I confess that 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.190
 to score the free kick with clichy 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.479
 you have to get up very early guys do not 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.380
 do not take the expression literally 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.380
 otherwise it becomes hot heavy 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.010
 it's a setback but it's great to 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.590
 can put a free kick with clichy 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.390
 today I admit this kind of 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.430
 situation does not happen often that's what 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.800
 what does my team look like poor 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.910
 Griezmann Ribery is heavy when 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.710
 even we can say that it is heavy 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.080
 there is good player there is a good level and 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.730
 especially griezmann the player I had 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.800
 first keeper you remember 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.690
 in my pack 25 goals in 17 matches 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.310
 it's really a monster a monster 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.149
 Guys I hope he'll feast on you 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.470
 during this episode 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.120
 let's go we Ivorian to 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.500
 chirp ok while she's going to burst who 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.270
 did not go through legends 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.010
 it's okay people are talking about people already 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.510
 it's a good little series well 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.180
 friendly will have to be solid the 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.160
 there's the guys there won the tevez is the vidal 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.420
 be careful to stay well positioned in 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.040
 defense the coach did the job 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.180
 before the match then we have everything for 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.680
 win the first division match and 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.090
 it's like the first time 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.260
 be directly laid the foundation to not 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.790
 let yourself be overwhelmed by stress 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.290
 go griezmann for the first strike 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.670
 of the match or two months I guys 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.840
 pity we start English well 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.370
 was closed but I tell you griezmann 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.190
 he can shoot even in a fly cube 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.330
 give it up yeah that's it yeah no 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.920
 not in division and my guy not 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.810
 renewed by the way or collective 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.250
 shows those words ribery that spoils everything 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.150
 here you are again there are 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.770
 matches where you have the impression that 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.660
 players they are there a cost center 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.050
 you have the impression that they are 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.780
 Types 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:01.080
 so yes it's good taste buds yes 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.080
 buds 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.730
 played well that they still have 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.319
 accelerated 15 0 for us I confess that the 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:16.879
 purpose is rather bokese who are there 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:19.099
 attention attention interesting if you 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:20.480
 also you believed even blue thumbs and 6 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.700
 kg did not believe even blue thumbs when 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.590
 same half time 1 0 stadiums are rather 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.150
 balanced but hey this player I do not like 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.920
 at all his way of playing he goes from 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.200
 hall there the guy he is tired of selling 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.670
 with go we make the base we do there 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.989
 down you win tricorn go let's 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.010
 we're going to show him what's 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.419
 a little football guys I have 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.099
 the impression that since this morning my 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:38.180
 connection it's shit it's because 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:42.639
 that she does the next manga but 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.959
 give up I 'm all alone up there 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.129
 after taking this you have to stop tifa 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.379
 normally but will play with the 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.190
 guardian but yes or who annoys me this guy 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:53.130
 or cause them to annoy me 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.930
 me that yes c'mon do well than here 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.320
 you're good we make 175 yards 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.260
 of purpose 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.730
 aulas he had he had and must shoot 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.140
 by against Griezmann must make the 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.590
 principle of football is to shoot in 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.850
 the ball is beaten to the clip has 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.990
 downright plunged he's doing the 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.990
 gym the guy lets down 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:23.880
 yes 2 0 that's good that level there 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.910
 is good we must finish well 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.050
 match 2 0 I think we got used 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:35.160
 the victory I think we can say 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:37.620
 that we are here for the moment in the 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.270
 mouth my skull he took in the 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.620
 face is hot it's more fifa it's 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.900
 at the office take me in the queue 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.970
 the guys here are the guys win 2-0 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.580
 in our first division game 1 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:51.110
 so we managed the check we started 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.110
 in the best possible way 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.070
 we created ourselves a lot 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.330
 Occasionally we did not concede much 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.130
 which is still rather 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.060
 encouraging so I hope this 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.190
