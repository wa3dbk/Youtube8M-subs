are pretty bright remember to cut it

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.550 
are pretty bright remember to cut it
down<00:01:27.729> a<00:01:27.880> bit<00:01:28.000> and<00:01:28.360> on<00:01:28.930> the<00:01:29.020> back<00:01:29.170> there<00:01:29.380> at<00:01:29.439> that

do<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.360> lighting<00:01:31.570> lives<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:38.229> now<00:01:38.350> let's<00:01:38.500> get

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
do the lighting lives so now let's get

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.190 
do the lighting lives so now let's get
into<00:01:38.770> powering<00:01:39.159> up<00:01:39.189> of<00:01:39.369> that<00:01:39.460> mini<00:01:39.899> so<00:01:40.899> before

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
into powering up of that mini so before

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.419 
into powering up of that mini so before
first<00:01:41.590> use<00:01:41.679> you're<00:01:42.009> actually<00:01:42.130> want<00:01:42.399> to

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
first use you're actually want to

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.999 
first use you're actually want to
charger<00:01:42.759> from<00:01:42.819> a<00:01:42.939> wall<00:01:43.149> outlet<00:01:43.179> or<00:01:43.720> a<00:01:43.750> USB<00:01:44.009> to

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
charger from a wall outlet or a USB to

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.770 
charger from a wall outlet or a USB to
help<00:01:45.159> optimize<00:01:45.700> that<00:01:45.880> battery<00:01:46.179> life<00:01:46.360> but

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
help optimize that battery life but

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.590 
help optimize that battery life but
after<00:01:46.960> that<00:01:47.020> you're<00:01:47.170> set<00:01:47.319> to<00:01:47.350> go<00:01:47.439> on<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:47.679> side

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
after that you're set to go on the side

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.029 
after that you're set to go on the side
to<00:01:49.600> charge<00:01:49.810> up<00:01:49.960> in<00:01:50.049> the<00:01:50.140> Sun<00:01:50.319> what<00:01:50.920> you're

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
to charge up in the Sun what you're

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:52.410 
to charge up in the Sun what you're
going<00:01:51.310> to<00:01:51.399> do<00:01:51.490> while<00:01:51.610> it's<00:01:51.789> fine<00:01:52.000> to<00:01:52.030> leave<00:01:52.179> it

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
going to do while it's fine to leave it

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.230 
going to do while it's fine to leave it
on<00:01:52.479> table<00:01:52.929> just<00:01:53.140> like<00:01:53.229> this<00:01:53.520> it's<00:01:54.520> even<00:01:54.939> better

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
on table just like this it's even better

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.580 
on table just like this it's even better
to<00:01:55.360> actually<00:01:55.659> prop<00:01:55.869> it<00:01:56.020> up<00:01:56.110> so<00:01:56.289> you<00:01:56.349> use<00:01:56.560> that

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
to actually prop it up so you use that

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.669 
to actually prop it up so you use that
reg<00:01:57.039> diffuser<00:01:57.490> to<00:01:57.880> prop<00:01:58.090> up<00:01:58.119> like<00:01:58.840> this<00:01:59.049> or

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
reg diffuser to prop up like this or

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:01.559 
reg diffuser to prop up like this or
even<00:01:59.830> like<00:02:00.039> this<00:02:00.250> so<00:02:00.490> you<00:02:00.580> get<00:02:00.759> a<00:02:01.030> better<00:02:01.479> angle

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
even like this so you get a better angle

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:05.370 
even like this so you get a better angle
