00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.160 
20,000 elixir you can actually going to
be<00:02:01.020> able<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.500> get<00:02:02.119> 10,000<00:02:03.119> elixir<00:02:03.600> back<00:02:03.930> and

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
be able to get 10,000 elixir back and

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.319 
be able to get 10,000 elixir back and
that<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.380> really<00:02:05.040> useful<00:02:05.369> because<00:02:05.790> for<00:02:06.210> you

know for example the Packers they are

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.229 
know for example the Packers they are
40,000<00:02:08.940> each<00:02:09.420> level<00:02:10.289> 3<00:02:10.879> you're<00:02:11.879> going<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.120> get

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
40,000 each level 3 you're going to get

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.740 
40,000 each level 3 you're going to get
20,000<00:02:13.170> back<00:02:13.349> like

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
20,000 back like

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.200 
20,000 back like
so<00:02:13.930> huge<00:02:14.440> huge<00:02:14.980> different<00:02:15.550> if<00:02:15.670> you're<00:02:16.120> going

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
so huge huge different if you're going

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.630 
so huge huge different if you're going
to<00:02:16.270> be<00:02:16.390> level<00:02:16.660> 10<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.160> so<00:02:18.160> if<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.340> can<00:02:18.490> see

twenty<00:05:17.380> percent<00:05:17.800> and<00:05:18.360> level<00:05:19.360> five<00:05:19.660> the

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
twenty percent and level five the

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.140

donated<00:05:20.530> troop<00:05:20.800> upgrade<00:05:21.370> is<00:05:21.550> going<00:05:21.790> to<00:05:21.850> be<00:05:21.910> one

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
donated troop upgrade is going to be one

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.630 
donated troop upgrade is going to be one
level<00:05:22.570> so<00:05:22.780> I<00:05:23.080> think<00:05:23.170> I<00:05:23.650> think<00:05:24.160> what<00:05:24.340> they<00:05:24.460> mean

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
level so I think I think what they mean

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.220 
level so I think I think what they mean
with<00:05:24.820> this<00:05:24.970> is<00:05:25.150> that<00:05:25.300> if<00:05:25.480> you<00:05:25.600> donate<00:05:25.930> level

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
with this is that if you donate level

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.590 
with this is that if you donate level
five<00:05:26.410> barbarians<00:05:26.770> that<00:05:27.220> the<00:05:27.820> other<00:05:27.970> guy<00:05:28.270> will

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 
five barbarians that the other guy will

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.800 
five barbarians that the other guy will
receive<00:05:29.050> level<00:05:30.040> seven<00:05:30.460> barbarians<00:05:30.970> or<00:05:31.210> a<00:05:31.270> no

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
receive level seven barbarians or a no

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.690 
receive level seven barbarians or a no
level<00:05:32.110> six<00:05:32.350> barbarians<00:05:32.890> so<00:05:33.130> yeah<00:05:33.550> I<00:05:33.610> think

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
level six barbarians so yeah I think

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.670 
level six barbarians so yeah I think
they<00:05:33.970> mean<00:05:34.150> that<00:05:34.210> with<00:05:34.660> it<00:05:34.840> um<00:05:34.990> I<00:05:35.260> could<00:05:35.380> be

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
they mean that with it um I could be

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.940 
they mean that with it um I could be
wrong<00:05:35.860> I<00:05:36.100> don't<00:05:36.580> know<00:05:36.640> if<00:05:36.850> I<00:05:37.060> could<00:05:37.710> but<00:05:38.710> yeah

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:02.980 
going to be two levels I think you know

barbarians<00:07:05.020> could<00:07:05.650> be<00:07:05.770> wrong<00:07:05.950> once<00:07:06.100> again<00:07:06.460> but

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:06.730 
barbarians could be wrong once again but

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.970 
barbarians could be wrong once again but
I<00:07:07.240> think<00:07:07.660> pretty<00:07:08.140> sure<00:07:08.380> that<00:07:08.590> that's<00:07:08.680> going<00:07:08.860> to

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:08.980 
I think pretty sure that that's going to

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.460 
I think pretty sure that that's going to
be<00:07:09.070> it's<00:07:09.280> the<00:07:10.150> word<00:07:10.390> loot<00:07:10.660> extra<00:07:11.020> storage<00:07:11.230> can

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:11.470 
be it's the word loot extra storage can

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.310 
be it's the word loot extra storage can
be<00:07:11.500> fifty<00:07:11.980> percent<00:07:12.520> so<00:07:13.240> that<00:07:13.540> was<00:07:13.690> it<00:07:13.930> for<00:07:13.960> this

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:14.320
