00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:08.900
 What has happened so far , I can do that 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.640
 I notice we realized that we 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:19.669
 they are both very hungry and 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:22.539
 Schicker has a tip called why 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:22.539
 she grins the prey 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.699
 m 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.809
 Euro 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.009
 the 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.299
 yes and now we are in prison here 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.510
 the feet on the way from tokio from the 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.490
 Lock up obscure a prison 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:57.860
 restaurant in a small cell amazon 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:59.899
 made possible and that is interesting 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.440
 Of course I do not read anything here 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.569
 can 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.920
 In front of the essence menu, I'll get that 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.899
 by schicker also do not translate 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.330
 let but only after optical 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.890
 if you decide 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.230
 says so nice the eye eats with 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.080
 in which case you have to say more 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.730
 one eats the eye with 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.340
 because a lot 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.930
 with us you can 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.930
 every second break 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.450
 O 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.650
 on 1 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.409
 they are 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.270
 this supposed beauty is here 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.740
 just opened last year 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:19.050
 the tokyo sky tree 634 meters and so on 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.300
 the tallest tv tower in the world is her 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.370
 the perfect place for many 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:28.040
 excited japanese on a heap too 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.040
 got to see 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:38.190
 lena 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:40.080
 this pen and here you see the reason 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.210
 why people are so excited one 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.550
 has the very best view from above 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.080
 fugees to the most sacred mountain of the 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.400
 japanese we were in the next 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.110
 Following the move again a 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.459
 explore it a bit more closely before then 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.730
 continues into the old imperial city 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:56.580
 Kyoto and I will be very happy 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.300
 probably throw soybeans 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:02.180
 have to let go 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.180
 Do not ask me that requires custom
