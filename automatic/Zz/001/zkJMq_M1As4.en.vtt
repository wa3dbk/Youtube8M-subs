00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
okay as you can see it the spider eggs

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.319 
okay as you can see it the spider eggs
are<00:00:04.979> not<00:00:05.069> actually<00:00:05.399> in<00:00:05.609> the<00:00:05.640> bananas<00:00:06.149> but

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:06.329 
are not actually in the bananas but

00:00:06.329 --> 00:00:07.849 
are not actually in the bananas but
they're<00:00:06.660> plastered<00:00:07.319> onto<00:00:07.439> the<00:00:07.589> side<00:00:07.740> of<00:00:07.769> the

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
they're plastered onto the side of the

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.520 
they're plastered onto the side of the
banana<00:00:08.069> peel<00:00:08.400> now<00:00:08.639> this<00:00:09.629> is<00:00:09.780> exactly<00:00:10.379> what<00:00:10.500> I

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
banana peel now this is exactly what I

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.810 
banana peel now this is exactly what I
plan<00:00:10.709> on<00:00:10.740> posting<00:00:10.980> in<00:00:11.250> this<00:00:11.370> channel<00:00:11.549> but<00:00:11.730> I

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
plan on posting in this channel but I

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.339 
plan on posting in this channel but I
thought<00:00:11.940> sure<00:00:12.360> he's<00:00:12.599> awareness<00:00:12.959> about<00:00:13.080> this

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
thought sure he's awareness about this

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.839 
thought sure he's awareness about this
because<00:00:13.499> it's<00:00:14.160> actually<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.580> can<00:00:14.820> be

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
because it's actually it can be

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.259 
because it's actually it can be
potentially<00:00:15.419> very<00:00:15.480> serious<00:00:17.060> just<00:00:18.060> going<00:00:18.210> to

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:18.269 
potentially very serious just going to

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:19.429 
potentially very serious just going to
zoom<00:00:18.420> in<00:00:18.539> just<00:00:18.660> get<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> better<00:00:18.990> look<00:00:19.199> at<00:00:19.320> them

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
zoom in just get a better look at them

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.060 
zoom in just get a better look at them
it's<00:00:19.920> pretty<00:00:20.490> gross<00:00:20.699> but<00:00:21.619> there's<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.740> -<00:00:22.890> and

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
it's pretty gross but there's the - and

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
it's pretty gross but there's the - and
there's<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.250> smaller<00:00:23.490> one<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.670> smaller<00:00:23.970> one

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
there's a smaller one that smaller one

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.070 
there's a smaller one that smaller one
actually<00:00:24.300> look<00:00:24.390> like<00:00:24.420> it<00:00:24.599> was<00:00:24.689> closer<00:00:24.929> to

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
actually look like it was closer to

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.810 
actually look like it was closer to
hatching<00:00:26.810> and<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:27.929> got<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.080> better<00:00:28.230> look<00:00:28.380> at<00:00:28.500> it

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
hatching and I got a better look at it

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.909 
hatching and I got a better look at it
it's<00:00:29.820> hard<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.029> tell<00:00:30.240> from<00:00:30.300> here<00:00:30.679> but<00:00:31.679> did

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:31.919 
it's hard to tell from here but did

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:33.470 
it's hard to tell from here but did
these<00:00:32.070> were<00:00:32.220> purchased<00:00:32.730> locally<00:00:32.850> at<00:00:33.150> a<00:00:33.180> local

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
these were purchased locally at a local

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.070 
these were purchased locally at a local
Loblaws<00:00:33.810> in<00:00:34.170> Toronto<00:00:34.950> Canada<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.930> we<00:00:36.930> have

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080 
Loblaws in Toronto Canada and we have

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.100 
Loblaws in Toronto Canada and we have
contacted<00:00:37.800> Dole<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.210> Loblaws<00:00:39.210> actually<00:00:39.570> to

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
contacted Dole and Loblaws actually to

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.650 
contacted Dole and Loblaws actually to
let<00:00:40.230> them<00:00:40.410> know<00:00:40.500> about<00:00:40.650> this<00:00:40.890> because<00:00:41.790> if<00:00:42.360> we

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
let them know about this because if we

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.090 
let them know about this because if we
if<00:00:42.870> was<00:00:43.020> possible<00:00:43.350> we<00:00:43.500> got<00:00:43.680> when<00:00:43.830> I'm<00:00:43.920> sure

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
if was possible we got when I'm sure

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.380 
if was possible we got when I'm sure
somebody<00:00:44.430> else<00:00:44.490> must<00:00:44.880> have<00:00:45.000> at<00:00:45.180> some<00:00:45.330> point

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
somebody else must have at some point

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.000 
somebody else must have at some point
caught<00:00:46.290> these<00:00:46.470> as<00:00:46.590> well<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:48.710> dole<00:00:49.710> hasn't

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
caught these as well and dole hasn't

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.040 
caught these as well and dole hasn't
really<00:00:50.160> responded<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.610> us<00:00:50.750> which<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.840> found

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
really responded to us which I found

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.320 
really responded to us which I found
surprising<00:00:52.560> but<00:00:52.710> Loblaws<00:00:53.430> has<00:00:53.700> and<00:00:54.090> they<00:00:54.150> just

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.330 
surprising but Loblaws has and they just

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.530 
surprising but Loblaws has and they just
basically<00:00:54.540> said<00:00:55.430> as<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.880> see<00:00:57.000> there<00:00:57.150> they<00:00:57.450> are

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380

so<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.390> pretty<00:01:15.570> disturbing<00:01:18.740> I'm<00:01:19.740> just

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
so it is pretty disturbing I'm just

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.190 
so it is pretty disturbing I'm just
going<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.100> rotate<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.420> better<00:01:21.719> look<00:01:21.990> at

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
going to rotate this you better look at

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.919 
going to rotate this you better look at
what<00:01:22.679> else<00:01:22.829> is<00:01:22.979> plastered<00:01:23.429> on<00:01:23.520> there<00:01:23.929> now

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
what else is plastered on there now

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:27.139 
what else is plastered on there now
Loblaw<00:01:25.530> said<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.920> these<00:01:26.009> are<00:01:26.369> rinsed<00:01:26.969> when

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
Loblaw said that these are rinsed when

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.450 
Loblaw said that these are rinsed when
they<00:01:27.299> are<00:01:27.390> picked<00:01:27.749> and<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.710> put<00:01:29.130> inside<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
they are picked and and put inside the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.190 
they are picked and and put inside the
Claudia<00:01:29.759> bath<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.390> looks<00:01:30.689> like<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.049> was

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
Claudia bath this looks like it was

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.749 
Claudia bath this looks like it was
after<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.619> factor<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.249> see<00:01:32.280> all<00:01:32.549> these

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
after that factor you see all these

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.940 
after that factor you see all these
these<00:01:33.630> little<00:01:33.899> black<00:01:34.020> spots<00:01:34.409> actually<00:01:34.679> here

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
these little black spots actually here

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.059 
these little black spots actually here
are<00:01:35.039> actually<00:01:35.310> dead<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.749> ants<00:01:37.079> got<00:01:38.009> a

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:38.069 
are actually dead that ants got a

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:39.349 
are actually dead that ants got a
plaster<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.729> side<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.149> I<00:01:39.179> would<00:01:39.329> think

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:39.359 
plaster to the side of it I would think

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:41.450 
plaster to the side of it I would think
chlorine<00:01:39.840> two<00:01:39.899> baths<00:01:40.049> were<00:01:40.350> at<00:01:41.100> least<00:01:41.280> four<00:01:41.399> in

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
chlorine two baths were at least four in

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.919 
chlorine two baths were at least four in
seized<00:01:41.640> office<00:01:41.999> or<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.179> setup<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.569> after<00:01:42.810> the

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
seized office or the setup and after the

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.629 
seized office or the setup and after the
fact<00:01:44.659> if<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.649> possible<00:01:46.859> before<00:01:47.369> maybe

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:47.639 
fact if it is possible before maybe

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:50.529 
fact if it is possible before maybe
maybe<00:01:48.179> the<00:01:48.299> cornea<00:01:48.600> bath<00:01:48.749> wouldn't<00:01:49.139> maybe

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
maybe the cornea bath wouldn't maybe

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.819 
maybe the cornea bath wouldn't maybe
kill<00:01:51.539> those<00:01:51.689> spiders<00:01:52.079> inside<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.499> egg<00:01:52.619> sack

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
kill those spiders inside that egg sack

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.910 
kill those spiders inside that egg sack
but<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.579> can't<00:01:54.210> be<00:01:54.270> sure

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
but I can't be sure

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.480 
but I can't be sure
anyways<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:55.950> wanted<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.369> raise<00:01:56.459> awareness

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
anyways I wanted to raise awareness

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.289 
anyways I wanted to raise awareness
because<00:01:56.969> these<00:01:57.539> are<00:01:57.749> potentially<00:01:59.030> deadly<00:02:00.030> or

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
because these are potentially deadly or

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.940 
because these are potentially deadly or
not<00:02:00.450> these<00:02:01.109> are<00:02:01.170> definitely<00:02:01.619> not<00:02:01.709> from<00:02:01.859> around

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
not these are definitely not from around

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.419 
not these are definitely not from around

I'm<00:02:02.819> no<00:02:03.359> expert<00:02:03.389> but<00:02:03.829> after<00:02:04.829> comparing<00:02:05.249> photos

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
I'm no expert but after comparing photos

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.120 
I'm no expert but after comparing photos
online<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.990> wandering<00:02:07.469> spider<00:02:07.709> egg<00:02:07.859> sacs

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
online of the wandering spider egg sacs

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.690 
online of the wandering spider egg sacs
they<00:02:08.250> do<00:02:08.430> look<00:02:08.610> very<00:02:08.670> similar<00:02:09.570> and<00:02:10.580> this<00:02:11.580> is

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
they do look very similar and this is

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.900 
they do look very similar and this is

from a large plate or nothing in Toronto
that<00:02:13.380> I've<00:02:13.860> noticed<00:02:14.630> anyways<00:02:15.630> that<00:02:15.750> would<00:02:15.840> be

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
that I've noticed anyways that would be

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.570 
that I've noticed anyways that would be
close<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.380> these<00:02:16.500> bananas<00:02:19.220> so<00:02:20.220> yeah<00:02:20.340> we<00:02:20.490> live

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
close to these bananas so yeah we live

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.250 
close to these bananas so yeah we live
in<00:02:20.700> an<00:02:20.790> old<00:02:20.910> house<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:21.450> if<00:02:21.510> this<00:02:21.780> were<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.050> hatch

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
in an old house so if this were to hatch

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.800 
in an old house so if this were to hatch
and<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.770> know<00:02:23.640> god<00:02:23.910> forbid<00:02:24.150> we<00:02:24.300> if<00:02:24.360> we<00:02:24.570> missed

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
and you know god forbid we if we missed

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.150 
and you know god forbid we if we missed
them<00:02:24.960> and<00:02:25.110> they<00:02:25.410> did<00:02:25.620> survive<00:02:25.890> in<00:02:26.070> her

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
them and they did survive in her

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
much we try to keep bugs out and seal

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.860 
much we try to keep bugs out and seal
everything<00:02:30.540> up<00:02:30.720> those<00:02:32.270> little<00:02:33.270> buggers<00:02:33.540> I

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
everything up those little buggers I

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.620 
everything up those little buggers I
just<00:02:34.410> find<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.680> way<00:02:34.800> back<00:02:35.010> in<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.490> uh<00:02:35.630> you

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
just find that way back in and uh you

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.600 
just find that way back in and uh you
know<00:02:36.750> it's<00:02:37.710> possible<00:02:38.100> that<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.280> spiders

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
know it's possible that the spiders

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.340 
know it's possible that the spiders
could<00:02:38.670> have<00:02:38.790> survived<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.210> an<00:02:39.570> age<00:02:39.720> where<00:02:40.260> they

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
could have survived to an age where they

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.280 
could have survived to an age where they
could<00:02:40.500> become<00:02:40.740> poisonous<00:02:41.190> or<00:02:41.370> venomous<00:02:42.290> I

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
could become poisonous or venomous I

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.080 
could become poisonous or venomous I
should<00:02:43.470> say<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:44.610> is<00:02:44.730> pretty<00:02:44.880> disturbing

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
should say it is pretty disturbing

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.580 
should say it is pretty disturbing
especially<00:02:45.540> we<00:02:45.900> have<00:02:45.990> young<00:02:46.080> kids<00:02:46.170> at<00:02:46.440> home

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
especially we have young kids at home

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.520 
especially we have young kids at home
now<00:02:47.540> I'm<00:02:48.540> not<00:02:48.720> looking<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:48.960> sue<00:02:49.170> over<00:02:49.290> this

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
now I'm not looking to sue over this

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.710 
now I'm not looking to sue over this
like<00:02:50.520> I<00:02:50.610> said<00:02:50.760> nothing<00:02:50.850> nothing<00:02:51.180> happened<00:02:51.690> I

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
like I said nothing nothing happened I

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.660 
like I said nothing nothing happened I
thinking<00:02:51.990> with<00:02:52.080> this<00:02:52.200> right<00:02:52.410> now<00:02:52.440> but<00:02:52.740> it<00:02:53.610> will

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
thinking with this right now but it will

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.430 
thinking with this right now but it will
be<00:02:53.820> at<00:02:53.940> least<00:02:54.060> just<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.540> gift<00:02:54.840> card<00:02:55.110> for<00:02:55.380> the

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
be at least just a gift card for the

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.310 
be at least just a gift card for the
bananas<00:02:55.800> a<00:02:55.830> lot<00:02:56.100> but<00:02:56.460> other<00:02:57.060> than<00:02:57.300> that<00:02:57.360> really

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
bananas a lot but other than that really

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.660 
bananas a lot but other than that really
wants<00:02:58.560> something<00:02:58.710> done<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.340> prevent<00:02:59.550> this

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
wants something done to prevent this

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.770 
wants something done to prevent this
from<00:02:59.730> happening<00:02:59.880> in<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.240> future

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
from happening in the future

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.870 
from happening in the future
like<00:03:01.380> maybe<00:03:01.890> after<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.310> chlorinated<00:03:02.730> bath

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
like maybe after the chlorinated bath

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.580 
like maybe after the chlorinated bath
and<00:03:03.240> rinsing<00:03:03.600> and<00:03:03.630> all<00:03:03.750> that<00:03:03.900> maybe<00:03:04.320> have<00:03:04.500> it

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
and rinsing and all that maybe have it

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.350 
and rinsing and all that maybe have it
bag<00:03:04.770> immediately<00:03:05.370> after<00:03:05.760> maybe<00:03:06.000> that<00:03:06.210> would

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
bag immediately after maybe that would

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.160 
bag immediately after maybe that would
prevent<00:03:06.570> it<00:03:06.750> I<00:03:06.960> don't<00:03:07.140> know<00:03:07.230> but<00:03:09.170> definitely

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
prevent it I don't know but definitely

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.030 
prevent it I don't know but definitely
something<00:03:10.470> more<00:03:10.920> needs<00:03:11.100> to<00:03:11.220> be<00:03:11.280> done<00:03:13.040> now

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
something more needs to be done now

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.010 
something more needs to be done now
we'll<00:03:14.220> be<00:03:14.310> putting<00:03:14.580> these<00:03:14.670> back<00:03:15.660> inside<00:03:15.900> the

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
we'll be putting these back inside the

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.420 
we'll be putting these back inside the
ziplock<00:03:16.320> bag<00:03:16.530> I<00:03:16.650> have<00:03:16.770> been<00:03:16.890> keeping<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.250> in<00:03:17.340> a

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
ziplock bag I have been keeping it in a

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.620 
ziplock bag I have been keeping it in a
shift<00:03:17.730> probably<00:03:18.030> just<00:03:18.209> because<00:03:18.360> I'm<00:03:18.510> paranoid

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
shift probably just because I'm paranoid

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.449 
shift probably just because I'm paranoid
I<00:03:18.900> probably<00:03:19.170> get<00:03:19.380> a<00:03:19.410> second<00:03:19.800> ziploc<00:03:20.250> bag<00:03:20.430> and

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
I probably get a second ziploc bag and

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.090 
I probably get a second ziploc bag and
put<00:03:20.700> inside<00:03:20.910> of<00:03:21.030> that<00:03:21.120> now<00:03:22.020> I<00:03:22.110> will<00:03:22.530> be<00:03:22.680> posting

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
put inside of that now I will be posting

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.449 
put inside of that now I will be posting
an<00:03:23.340> update<00:03:24.830> whether<00:03:25.830> or<00:03:25.950> not<00:03:26.070> they've<00:03:26.250> hatched

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
an update whether or not they've hatched

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.680 
an update whether or not they've hatched
the<00:03:27.420> next<00:03:27.660> few<00:03:27.780> days

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
the next few days

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.820 
the next few days
maybe<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.810> deprivation<00:03:31.080> of<00:03:31.350> air<00:03:31.530> is<00:03:31.620> maybe

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
maybe the deprivation of air is maybe

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:32.900 
maybe the deprivation of air is maybe
going<00:03:32.070> to<00:03:32.160> prevent<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.520> eggs<00:03:32.640> from<00:03:32.790> hatching

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
going to prevent the eggs from hatching

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:33.980 
going to prevent the eggs from hatching
I<00:03:33.240> don't<00:03:33.390> know<00:03:33.450> if<00:03:33.510> that's<00:03:33.630> really<00:03:33.750> going<00:03:33.870> to

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
I don't know if that's really going to

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.690 
I don't know if that's really going to
be<00:03:34.050> a<00:03:34.110> factor<00:03:34.320> there's<00:03:34.890> still<00:03:35.070> some<00:03:35.310> oxygen<00:03:35.640> in

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
be a factor there's still some oxygen in
