00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.410
 I 'm going to sing to him now, humming 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:14.839
 Quick the song so you can see how 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.009

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:21.800

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.239
 chords then go to the video that is 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.460

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:27.370

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.920
 make 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.270
 after and after they do all this 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.490
 sequence of chords that the introduction 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.240
 start singing with these two chords 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:39.800

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.850
 says I do not have hot water in the 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.070
 water heater 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.310

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.310

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.290
 you do not see 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.940
 that the world is still here 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:08.250
 turn inside out while you look at those eyes 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.220
 of video tape and start again 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.770
 here is a sun that this sun is going 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.530
 just in the second stanza 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.100
 because as I said just says eyes of the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.619
 video tape and the exam comes 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.870
 the touch begins again as the 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:32.540
 principle is repeating the 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:35.000
 the dow el fa and the 2 this repeats everything and 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.430
 that sun is because the second part if 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.430
 says video eyes t 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.649
 and there the sun goes and goes to the other side 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:53.360
 this strange world now forever the 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:57.439
 movie that he saw once and repeats and this 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.470
 the world will tell you that it is always better to look 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.410
 to peace 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.000
 and then repeat all good I hope that 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.150
