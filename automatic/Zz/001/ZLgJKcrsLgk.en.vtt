looking<00:00:57.680> sequence<00:00:58.430> I've<00:00:58.579> ever<00:00:58.850> seen<00:00:59.239> and<00:00:59.510> it

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
looking sequence I've ever seen and it

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.280 
looking sequence I've ever seen and it
just<00:01:00.739> seems<00:01:00.920> that<00:01:01.010> he<00:01:02.000> keeps<00:01:02.270> trying<00:01:02.629> to<00:01:03.020> drop

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290
