00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.510
 that's down to me because I 'm doing 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.930
 something always together 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.840

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.959
 Enter cutting beans 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.810
 and here I have the oil in a pan 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.150
 Incidentally, this is my flag of 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.489
 rumsfeld I use only for it 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.640
 I also have an extra 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.630
 cover it because I will then hand 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.200
 sear 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.200
 But there is a method 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:41.920
 should place I show you there 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:44.920
 really always so red 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.920

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:32.680
 especially made about 50 of them 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.970

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.169

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:40.470
 I told you I got here 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:40.470
 secretly simply cover the lid brown 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.330
 turn around 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:26.489
 already too far 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:30.489
 But now she wants to get away from that 

00:05:26.489 --> 00:05:32.529
 stove top because there are no falls during the day 

00:05:30.489 --> 00:05:35.589
 otherwise come on it strange 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:45.539
 So I have all the bowls here 

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:45.539

00:05:48.210 --> 00:06:00.599

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:16.580
