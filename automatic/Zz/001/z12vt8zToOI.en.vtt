00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.840
 there are very good here I bring you a video 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.720
 of both arms that were used in the 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.620
 world cup of the fifa 2014 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:23.390
 how can you see the boxes and forgive the 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.390
 faces in both balls are equal 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:37.660
 and then this value was to give a 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:40.420
 explanation to what was presented on 9 of 9 9 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.030
 December 2013 and got its name 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.510
 on September 2, 2012 in a 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.579
 vote among three names brazuca 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.300
 bossanova and carnival and the one who won 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.300
 it was now sugar 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:59.740
 it means 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.960
 no but that one of the two words 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:07.210
 brasilia and sugar 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.210
 well let's go with the unboxing 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.380
 is this Argentina 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.610
 already in the video what is edited is to put a 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.610
 picture this maybe at the end 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.299
 at the moment and as a label of 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.180
 symbol of the fifa I think if you 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:52.300
 reach to see out there look there is 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.100
 I think I did 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.979
 5 works brasil 2014 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.880
 and good here is the value too 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:05.610
 I will expose some pictures there is the symbol 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.560
 of lives without flying worldwide and symbol of 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.310
 What is it 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.000
 from fifa 40 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.480
 and we could see here 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.450
 this equal the sign of singular life 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.989
 world and the name 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.989
 with much 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.500
 because it has cost two thousand pesos 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.950
 Mexicans 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.250
 this slope 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.460
 around that costs 700 pesos and then 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.750
 good 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:44.870
 for near the end 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.870
 that this cost me 350 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:52.469
 it is 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.710
 around here it's basically the same as 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:57.390
 best 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.390
 it opens the same and the whole roll 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.140
 is 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.470
 this cost me cheaper because it's not the 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.350
 replica 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:12.230
 it is not the original and apart is not the 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:14.780
 replica this one is going to see 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.700
 well first nothing the colors are 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.050
 different from the other 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:25.480
 adidas and here for your channel max river 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.480
 world where click to replica 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.430
 to greater replicas but in this language and 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.230
 tomb rider so if you leave two real 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.270
 like the other 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.940
 would be 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.390
 it would be more 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:45.200
 more expensive in this on the contrary it cost me 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:48.530
 350 and the original replica cost 700 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.920
 same but here is the gift of here 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.980
 December of the fifa here some stickers 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:58.290
 who can or took them off 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:01.989
 here the same symbol of adidas the 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:04.590
 symbol of the world faith and here is what 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:07.129
 that the sign would be missing 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.129
 in the other one 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.219
 this symbol 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:19.180
 here would be the fifa quality here not 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.959
 comes if it would be doing there because here 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.799
 there is the logo 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.799
 as well 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:32.650
 and then you would miss 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.510
 that you can know what else is missing 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:39.080
 here is the name of this one 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:42.470
 and the name of this state here 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.620
 and then the unboxing a little more than 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.620
 information 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.220
 and I have it on the computer 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:57.200
 both sugar balls have a 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:00.830
 technology and ethics the ball that was used 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.860
 in Euro 2012 and the katusha of 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.729
 the 2013 confederation that has six 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.509
 bone panels 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:12.539
 that is, by this cross it would be a 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:15.689
 panel and there are like there are three colors there 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:18.180
 two of each color and here then all the 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:20.970
 panels are the same 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.380
 all of these are the same but there are six in 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:27.740
 each value 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:31.130
 and has six that help improve 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:33.260
 control and contact as well as the 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.170
 stability and aerodynamics on the 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.710
 ground or the court is also the 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:42.460
 ball that more tests 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:46.950
 has been submitted for example the ball of 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.950
 adidas that more back sustained as 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:51.559
 so that it does not happen the same as with the 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.190
 'jabulani' that I also make a 

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:55.680
 review 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:58.590
 because that ball was multiplied by 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:02.910
 be very light and corsi and this ball in 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:05.430
 change was submitted by several players 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:09.420
 star such as messi inter squares 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:12.950
 tiger juanes and without density 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:15.190
 and that's why it makes it a safe value 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.390
 promises to be one of the best balls 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.700
 it's fine I 'm recording it I'm going to 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:22.910
 start the world cup does not know this 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:25.940
 value is already being used but this 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.449
 it's not the final one yet it's not 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.400
 use 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:33.000
 so this is not yet 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.430
 can be estimated 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.850
 Well then here the video and then 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:40.530
 I hope you liked it and then here 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.740
 it's over until the next 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.740
 goodbye
