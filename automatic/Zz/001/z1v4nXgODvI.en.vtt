00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
single track with the roots and rocks

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:27.990 
single track with the roots and rocks
let's<00:02:00.410> see

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.199

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
climb it and still have a while spare

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:51.430 
climb it and still have a while spare
clearing<00:02:36.860> left<00:02:37.099> so<00:02:37.670> fine<00:02:50.170> okay

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
clearing left so fine okay

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.160 
clearing left so fine okay
no<00:02:52.099> spin<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.489> first<00:02:52.700> that's<00:02:52.910> right<00:02:53.170> simply

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170

work okay

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:00.309 
work okay
so<00:02:56.049> shifting<00:02:57.049> is<00:02:57.200> smooth<00:02:57.470> and<00:02:58.840> it's<00:02:59.840> very

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
so shifting is smooth and it's very

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.170 
so shifting is smooth and it's very
quiet<00:03:00.620> and<00:03:01.720> no<00:03:02.720> problem<00:03:03.110> so<00:03:03.260> far<00:03:03.500> so<00:03:04.180> let's

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
quiet and no problem so far so let's
