00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
and the simulator so let's just get

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.499 
and the simulator so let's just get
going<00:00:23.110> here<00:00:23.560> the<00:00:24.040> first<00:00:24.279> thing<00:00:24.340> I<00:00:24.520> mention<00:00:25.360> is

of ubuntu and we've been testing with

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.280 
of ubuntu and we've been testing with
the<00:00:39.430> 64-bit<00:00:40.120> version<00:00:40.510> and<00:00:40.720> suggest<00:00:41.080> that<00:00:41.199> you

computer and a good internet connection

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.500 
computer and a good internet connection
for<00:00:47.860> the<00:00:48.010> install<00:00:48.370> once<00:00:48.670> its<00:00:48.850> installed<00:00:49.030> the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
for the install once its installed the

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.819 
for the install once its installed the
internet<00:00:49.780> connection<00:00:50.110> isn't<00:00:50.260> important

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
internet connection isn't important

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:52.500 
internet connection isn't important
anymore<00:00:50.860> but<00:00:51.760> it's<00:00:51.969> going<00:00:52.090> to<00:00:52.149> have<00:00:52.450> to

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
anymore but it's going to have to

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.330 
anymore but it's going to have to
download<00:00:52.750> a<00:00:52.989> bunch<00:00:53.230> of<00:00:53.410> pieces<00:00:53.680> to<00:00:53.890> get<00:00:54.219> this

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
download a bunch of pieces to get this

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.240 
download a bunch of pieces to get this
installed<00:00:54.640> and<00:00:55.739> having<00:00:56.739> a<00:00:56.800> fast<00:00:57.010> inter

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
installed and having a fast inter

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.470 
installed and having a fast inter
connection<00:00:57.610> will<00:00:57.700> make<00:00:57.850> that<00:00:58.000> a<00:00:58.030> lot<00:00:58.239> easier

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
connection will make that a lot easier

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.500 
connection will make that a lot easier
and<00:00:58.809> the<00:00:59.620> other<00:00:59.770> the<00:00:59.980> last<00:01:00.219> thing<00:01:00.430> is<00:01:00.610> that<00:01:01.210> the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
and the other the last thing is that the

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.389 
and the other the last thing is that the
partition<00:01:02.079> in<00:01:02.350> which<00:01:02.770> you<00:01:02.860> have<00:01:02.920> a<00:01:03.010> bun<00:01:03.250> to

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
partition in which you have a bun to

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.600 
partition in which you have a bun to
install<00:01:03.789> whether<00:01:04.180> it<00:01:04.360> be<00:01:04.390> a<00:01:04.800> full<00:01:05.800> disk<00:01:06.100> or

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
install whether it be a full disk or

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.160 
install whether it be a full disk or
just<00:01:06.880> a<00:01:06.940> portion<00:01:07.210> of<00:01:07.390> a<00:01:07.479> disk<00:01:07.720> with<00:01:07.840> a<00:01:07.960> dual

just a portion of a disk with a dual

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.170 
just a portion of a disk with a dual
boot<00:01:08.380> system<00:01:08.619> probably<00:01:09.490> wants<00:01:09.789> to<00:01:09.880> be<00:01:09.970> about

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
boot system probably wants to be about

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.560 
boot system probably wants to be about
30<00:01:10.450> gigabytes<00:01:11.100> now<00:01:12.100> the<00:01:12.240> instructions<00:01:13.240> for

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
and maybe set up a dual boot system if

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.660 
and maybe set up a dual boot system if
that's<00:01:36.400> something<00:01:36.610> that<00:01:36.759> you<00:01:36.970> want<00:01:37.180> and<00:01:37.479> then

fast so the first execution to open a
terminal<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:56.470> which<00:01:56.649> misguided<00:01:57.450> by<00:01:58.450> opening

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
terminal so which misguided by opening

terminal so which misguided by opening
the<00:01:58.840> temple<00:01:59.259> and<00:02:01.110> once<00:02:02.110> this<00:02:02.320> opens<00:02:02.740> up<00:02:02.890> we're

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
the temple and once this opens up we're

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:05.280 
the temple and once this opens up we're
going<00:02:03.790> to<00:02:03.939> one<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.270> Installer<00:02:04.689> so<00:02:05.049> we<00:02:05.140> just

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
going to one the Installer so we just

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.889 
going to one the Installer so we just
copy<00:02:05.649> and<00:02:05.829> paste<00:02:06.329> just<00:02:07.329> a<00:02:07.390> little<00:02:07.509> bit<00:02:07.630> of<00:02:07.720> code

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
copy and paste just a little bit of code

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.020 
copy and paste just a little bit of code
why<00:02:08.079> heat<00:02:08.350> if<00:02:08.530> we<00:02:08.769> copy<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:10.209> let<00:02:11.019> me<00:02:11.110> paste<00:02:11.350> it

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
why heat if we copy it let me paste it

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.319 
why heat if we copy it let me paste it
and<00:02:13.030> then<00:02:13.360> we<00:02:13.450> hit<00:02:13.570> enter<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:15.269> ended<00:02:16.269> up

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
and then we hit enter and ended up

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.170 
and then we hit enter and ended up
that's<00:02:16.540> what<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:18.250> now<00:02:18.430> is<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:18.640> path<00:02:18.850> Lloyd's

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
that's what and now is the path Lloyd's

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.420 
that's what and now is the path Lloyd's
been<00:02:19.420> entered<00:02:19.989> it<00:02:20.230> touched<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.680> installation

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
been entered it touched the installation

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.130 
been entered it touched the installation
process<00:02:21.459> so<00:02:22.150> it's<00:02:22.239> going<00:02:22.330> to<00:02:22.420> set<00:02:22.660> up<00:02:22.840> the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
process so it's going to set up the

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.440 
process so it's going to set up the
computer<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:24.099> download<00:02:24.550> all<00:02:25.090> of<00:02:25.150> the

computer to download all of the

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.040 
computer to download all of the
seemingly

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
seemingly

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.380 
seemingly
software<00:02:27.050> so<00:02:27.830> that<00:02:27.860> it<00:02:28.130> will<00:02:28.190> just<00:02:28.430> work<00:02:28.610> and

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
software so that it will just work and

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.700 
software so that it will just work and
this<00:02:29.540> is<00:02:29.660> everything<00:02:30.110> right<00:02:30.290> so<00:02:30.590> this

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
this is everything right so this

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.610 
this is everything right so this
includes<00:02:31.160> yeah<00:02:31.970> simulation<00:02:32.600> software<00:02:32.750> yeah

includes yeah simulation software yeah

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.930 
includes yeah simulation software yeah
this<00:02:33.710> includes<00:02:34.040> not<00:02:34.190> only<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.430> simulation

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
this includes not only the simulation

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.030 
this includes not only the simulation
software<00:02:35.120> but<00:02:35.450> all<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.810> normal<00:02:36.020> FFC<00:02:36.530> tools<00:02:36.770> so

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
software but all the normal FFC tools so

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.940

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
FOC and all of this stuff that with the

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.580 
FOC and all of this stuff that with the
exception<00:02:43.850> of<00:02:44.209> the<00:02:44.360> drive<00:02:44.540> is<00:02:44.750> tasted<00:02:45.170> and<00:02:45.380> the

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
exception of the drive is tasted and the

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.530 
exception of the drive is tasted and the
anti<00:02:45.860> utilities<00:02:46.400> okay<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:47.360> then<00:02:47.450> this

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
anti utilities okay and then this

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.020 
anti utilities okay and then this
process<00:02:48.050> will<00:02:48.260> take<00:02:48.290> a<00:02:48.500> while<00:02:48.770> but<00:02:49.760> it<00:02:49.880> should

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
process will take a while but it should

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.910 
process will take a while but it should
just<00:02:50.180> run<00:02:50.330> completely<00:02:50.780> unattended<00:02:51.260> go<00:02:51.770> by

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
just run completely unattended go by

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.530 
just run completely unattended go by
itself<00:02:52.220> and<00:02:52.550> so<00:02:52.640> you<00:02:52.730> can<00:02:52.850> come<00:02:53.030> back<00:02:53.180> wall<00:02:53.420> by

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
itself and so you can come back wall by

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.390 
itself and so you can come back wall by
later<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.080> see<00:02:54.590> if<00:02:54.650> there's<00:02:54.830> any<00:02:54.950> error

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
later and see if there's any error

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.830 
later and see if there's any error
messages<00:02:55.880> or<00:02:56.030> anything<00:02:56.330> else<00:02:56.510> that<00:02:56.570> you<00:02:56.720> need

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
messages or anything else that you need

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.440 
messages or anything else that you need
to<00:02:56.990> deal<00:02:57.020> with<00:02:57.410> but<00:02:57.590> otherwise<00:02:58.120> in<00:02:59.120> a<00:02:59.270> few

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
to deal with but otherwise in a few

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.020 
to deal with but otherwise in a few
minutes<00:02:59.600> we<00:02:59.930> should<00:02:59.989> have<00:03:00.350> all<00:03:00.880> that<00:03:01.880> stuff

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
minutes we should have all that stuff

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.790 
minutes we should have all that stuff
installed<00:03:02.450> on<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.840> system<00:03:02.989> and<00:03:03.380> then<00:03:03.500> we<00:03:03.620> can

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
installed on the system and then we can

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.740 
installed on the system and then we can
show<00:03:04.100> you<00:03:04.190> how<00:03:04.310> to<00:03:04.400> use<00:03:04.459> it<00:03:04.760> now<00:03:05.270> that<00:03:05.540> it's

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
show you how to use it now that it's

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.160 
show you how to use it now that it's
finished<00:03:06.500> downloading<00:03:06.940> weird<00:03:07.940> on<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:08.570> it

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
finished downloading weird on and it

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.960 
finished downloading weird on and it
should<00:03:09.620> say<00:03:09.800> installation<00:03:10.430> finished<00:03:10.760> hit

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
should say installation finished hit

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.910 
should say installation finished hit
enter<00:03:11.300> to<00:03:11.450> exit<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:11.870> and<00:03:12.050> if<00:03:12.530> there<00:03:12.680> were<00:03:12.739> any

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
enter to exit it and if there were any

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.740 
enter to exit it and if there were any
errors<00:03:13.400> that<00:03:13.550> I<00:03:13.610> could<00:03:13.850> cut<00:03:14.090> it<00:03:14.390> would<00:03:14.540> print

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
errors that I could cut it would print

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.330 
errors that I could cut it would print
that<00:03:14.840> message<00:03:15.290> hopefully<00:03:16.190> with<00:03:16.310> some

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
that message hopefully with some

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.920 
that message hopefully with some
indication<00:03:17.060> saying<00:03:17.420> like<00:03:17.630> you're<00:03:17.810> not

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
indication saying like you're not

connected to the internet or whatever is

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.800 
connected to the internet or whatever is
long<00:03:21.010> so<00:03:22.010> and<00:03:22.340> just<00:03:22.640> for<00:03:22.880> reference<00:03:23.030> this<00:03:23.510> took

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
long so and just for reference this took

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.120 
long so and just for reference this took
about<00:03:23.989> a<00:03:24.140> little<00:03:24.380> bit<00:03:24.560> less<00:03:24.709> than<00:03:24.739> five

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
about a little bit less than five

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.580 
about a little bit less than five
minutes<00:03:25.430> to<00:03:25.670> do<00:03:25.910> here<00:03:26.420> at<00:03:26.570> WPI<00:03:27.110> although<00:03:27.470> we're

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
minutes to do here at WPI although we're

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.820 
minutes to do here at WPI although we're
on<00:03:27.650> a<00:03:27.709> very<00:03:27.739> fast<00:03:28.220> network<00:03:28.550> so<00:03:28.850> um<00:03:29.590> your<00:03:30.590> time

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
on a very fast network so um your time

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.620 
on a very fast network so um your time
will<00:03:31.040> really<00:03:31.370> depend<00:03:31.519> on<00:03:31.970> since<00:03:32.450> this<00:03:32.570> is

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
will really depend on since this is

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.300 
will really depend on since this is
primarily<00:03:32.930> downloading<00:03:33.680> stuff<00:03:33.860> will<00:03:34.010> depend

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
primarily downloading stuff will depend

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.870 
primarily downloading stuff will depend
on<00:03:34.430> how<00:03:34.880> good<00:03:35.390> your<00:03:35.540> network<00:03:35.959> connection<00:03:36.049> is

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
on how good your network connection is

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.660 
on how good your network connection is
so<00:03:37.880> now<00:03:38.030> don't<00:03:38.360> you<00:03:38.540> etha<00:03:38.959> don't<00:03:39.890> go<00:03:40.100> away<00:03:40.160> and

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
so now don't you etha don't go away and

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.509 
so now don't you etha don't go away and
now<00:03:41.239> we<00:03:41.299> can<00:03:41.540> open<00:03:41.690> up<00:03:41.870> eclipse<00:03:42.280> so<00:03:43.280> here's

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
now we can open up eclipse so here's
