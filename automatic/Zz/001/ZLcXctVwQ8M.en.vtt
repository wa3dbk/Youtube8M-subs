makes<00:01:29.180> it<00:01:29.300> easy<00:01:29.479> to<00:01:29.570> grab<00:01:30.550> then<00:01:31.550> go<00:01:31.700> ahead<00:01:31.790> and

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
makes it easy to grab then go ahead and

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.330 
makes it easy to grab then go ahead and
start<00:01:32.149> to<00:01:32.270> remove<00:01:32.360> slide<00:01:32.750> one<00:01:33.070> just<00:01:34.070> peel<00:01:34.310> it

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
start to remove slide one just peel it

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.530 
start to remove slide one just peel it
back<00:01:34.610> about<00:01:34.840> 25%<00:01:35.840> of<00:01:35.930> the<00:01:36.020> way<00:01:40.270> so<00:01:41.270> you<00:01:41.330> want<00:01:41.479> to

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:07.630 
will do most of the work for you in this
particular<00:02:06.170> example<00:02:06.470> I'm<00:02:06.920> pretty<00:02:07.190> close<00:02:07.399> on

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
particular example I'm pretty close on

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.100 
particular example I'm pretty close on
the<00:02:07.789> left-hand<00:02:08.149> side<00:02:08.270> so<00:02:08.479> I'm<00:02:08.720> using<00:02:08.959> the

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
the left-hand side so I'm using the

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:21.809 
the left-hand side so I'm using the
application<00:02:09.590> card<00:02:09.830> just<00:02:10.069> to<00:02:10.130> work<00:02:10.369> it<00:02:10.520> down

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.370 

just<00:02:22.819> keep<00:02:23.030> working<00:02:23.390> it<00:02:23.450> down<00:02:23.480> taking<00:02:24.260> your

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
just keep working it down taking your

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:31.199 
just keep working it down taking your
time

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.369 

now<00:02:32.209> if<00:02:32.269> you<00:02:32.360> do<00:02:32.510> get<00:02:32.689> an<00:02:32.780> air<00:02:32.900> bubble<00:02:33.080> caused

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
now if you do get an air bubble caused

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:34.750 
now if you do get an air bubble caused
by<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.620> speck<00:02:33.860> of<00:02:33.890> dust<00:02:34.099> you're<00:02:34.370> never<00:02:34.549> going<00:02:34.730> to

just use the sticky surface and scotch
tape<00:02:45.860> just<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:46.159> grab<00:02:46.370> that<00:02:46.519> piece<00:02:46.730> of<00:02:46.940> dust

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.009 

then<00:02:55.040> carry<00:02:55.340> on<00:02:55.549> working<00:02:55.760> working<00:02:56.540> down<00:02:56.810> with

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
then carry on working working down with

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.830 
then carry on working working down with
the<00:02:57.109> application<00:02:57.650> card<00:03:01.390> screen<00:03:02.390> protector<00:03:02.810> is

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
the application card screen protector is

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.899 
the application card screen protector is
a<00:03:02.959> pretty<00:03:03.260> good<00:03:03.500> fit<00:03:03.769> for<00:03:03.799> the<00:03:04.129> Model<00:03:04.489> S<00:03:04.579> screen

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:06.819 
a pretty good fit for the Model S screen
so<00:03:05.150> when<00:03:05.239> you<00:03:05.329> get<00:03:05.450> to<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.629> bottom<00:03:05.930> just<00:03:06.500> use

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
so when you get to the bottom just use

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.349 
so when you get to the bottom just use
the<00:03:07.010> application<00:03:07.489> card<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.879> tuck<00:03:08.090> it<00:03:08.239> behind

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
the application card to tuck it behind

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.720 
little able to pull this top layer off
you<00:03:21.409> can<00:03:21.560> see<00:03:21.739> here<00:03:22.010> we're<00:03:22.159> using<00:03:22.190> the

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
you can see here we're using the

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.729 
you can see here we're using the
anti-glare<00:03:23.540> screen<00:03:23.599> protector<00:03:24.379> so<00:03:24.620> you'll

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
anti-glare screen protector so you'll

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.550 
anti-glare screen protector so you'll
see<00:03:24.950> the<00:03:25.069> difference<00:03:25.400> as<00:03:25.519> you<00:03:25.549> peel<00:03:25.790> this<00:03:25.940> off

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
see the difference as you peel this off

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.140 
see the difference as you peel this off
this<00:03:27.560> is<00:03:27.620> from<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.159> passenger<00:03:28.609> vo<00:03:28.790> suppose

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
this is from the passenger vo suppose

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.149 
this is from the passenger vo suppose
the<00:03:29.870> glare<00:03:30.109> is<00:03:30.230> a<00:03:30.260> little<00:03:30.500> more<00:03:30.650> exaggerated

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:31.159 
the glare is a little more exaggerated

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.360 
the glare is a little more exaggerated
Theory<00:03:31.790> does<00:03:31.940> make<00:03:32.180> a<00:03:32.209> difference<00:03:33.190> you'll<00:03:34.190> see

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
Theory does make a difference you'll see

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.800 
Theory does make a difference you'll see
a<00:03:34.400> few<00:03:34.579> more<00:03:34.669> bubbles<00:03:35.030> just<00:03:35.090> work-wise<00:03:35.629> out

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
a few more bubbles just work-wise out

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:43.330 
a few more bubbles just work-wise out
with<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.049> application<00:03:36.620> card<00:03:42.069> and<00:03:43.069> you're

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
with the application card and you're
