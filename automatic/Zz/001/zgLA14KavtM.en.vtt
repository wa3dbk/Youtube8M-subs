a CVT has a broader range of gearing but
you<00:03:53.870> know<00:03:53.989> what<00:03:54.230> when<00:03:54.440> driving<00:03:54.860> it<00:03:54.980> you<00:03:55.010> don't

you know what when driving it you don't

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.770 
you know what when driving it you don't
really<00:03:55.489> notice<00:03:55.819> that<00:03:56.030> this<00:03:56.239> engine<00:03:56.390> is<00:03:56.600> any

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
more responsive than the old unit when

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.300 
more responsive than the old unit when
you<00:03:58.730> are<00:03:58.940> on<00:03:59.120> the<00:03:59.209> highway<00:03:59.420> at<00:03:59.870> even<00:04:00.530> 75<00:04:01.040> miles

you are on the highway at even 75 miles
an<00:04:01.459> hour<00:04:01.610> it<00:04:01.910> will<00:04:02.120> pick<00:04:02.420> up<00:04:02.600> and<00:04:02.840> continue<00:04:02.930> to

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
an hour it will pick up and continue to

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.290 
an hour it will pick up and continue to
gain<00:04:03.470> speed<00:04:03.860> but<00:04:04.340> other<00:04:04.550> than<00:04:04.670> that<00:04:04.760> it<00:04:05.060> feels

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
gain speed but other than that it feels

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.479 
gain speed but other than that it feels
very<00:04:05.569> similar<00:04:05.810> to<00:04:06.050> the<00:04:06.140> old<00:04:06.170> unit<00:04:06.709> and<00:04:06.860> this

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
very similar to the old unit and this

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.009 
very similar to the old unit and this
can't<00:04:07.760> be<00:04:07.850> blamed<00:04:08.090> on<00:04:08.239> weight<00:04:08.450> gain<00:04:08.480> this

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
can't be blamed on weight gain this

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.720 
can't be blamed on weight gain this
vehicle<00:04:09.470> still<00:04:09.650> does<00:04:09.920> weigh<00:04:10.190> roughly<00:04:10.459> the

vehicle still does weigh roughly the
same<00:04:10.940> I<00:04:11.180> would<00:04:11.600> say<00:04:11.810> it<00:04:12.049> may<00:04:12.200> have<00:04:12.470> more<00:04:12.680> to<00:04:12.799> do

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
same I would say it may have more to do

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.280 
same I would say it may have more to do
with<00:04:13.310> the<00:04:13.489> actual<00:04:13.850> gearing<00:04:14.390> to<00:04:14.750> save<00:04:14.930> fuel

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
with the actual gearing to save fuel

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.870 
with the actual gearing to save fuel
because<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:15.769> new<00:04:15.890> fit<00:04:16.100> is<00:04:16.280> a<00:04:16.310> lot<00:04:16.700> more

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
because the new fit is a lot more

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.550 
because the new fit is a lot more
efficient<00:04:17.329> put<00:04:17.810> it<00:04:17.900> in<00:04:17.989> sport<00:04:18.229> mode<00:04:18.320> though

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
efficient put it in sport mode though

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.870 
efficient put it in sport mode though
and<00:04:18.739> the<00:04:18.799> car<00:04:19.010> does<00:04:19.190> become<00:04:19.489> a<00:04:19.519> lot<00:04:19.850> more

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
and the car does become a lot more

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.909 
and the car does become a lot more
lively<00:04:20.479> and<00:04:20.570> the<00:04:20.630> paddle<00:04:20.930> shifters<00:04:21.320> will<00:04:21.530> even

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
lively and the paddle shifters will even

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.969 
lively and the paddle shifters will even

six-speed manual

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.520

it<00:04:31.520> offers<00:04:31.820> short<00:04:32.090> throws<00:04:32.539> and<00:04:32.930> a<00:04:33.080> somewhat

it offers short throws and a somewhat

it offers short throws and a somewhat

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
soft clutch pedal but it is very precise

soft clutch pedal but it is very precise
I<00:04:36.530> know<00:04:37.220> it's<00:04:37.490> not<00:04:37.580> the<00:04:37.760> case<00:04:37.940> but<00:04:38.210> the<00:04:38.300> engine

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
I know it's not the case but the engine

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.120 
I know it's not the case but the engine
actually<00:04:38.690> feels<00:04:39.110> more<00:04:39.350> powerful<00:04:39.830> with<00:04:40.010> the

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
actually feels more powerful with the

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.010 
actually feels more powerful with the
manual<00:04:40.460> transmission<00:04:40.630> the<00:04:41.630> only<00:04:41.840> real

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
manual transmission the only real

manual transmission the only real
downside<00:04:42.289> I<00:04:42.620> found<00:04:42.950> with<00:04:43.100> driving<00:04:43.340> this<00:04:43.580> car

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
downside I found with driving this car

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.940 
downside I found with driving this car
as<00:04:44.000> this<00:04:44.120> turning<00:04:44.539> radius<00:04:44.870> it<00:04:45.410> is<00:04:45.590> atrocious

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
as this turning radius it is atrocious

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.980 
as this turning radius it is atrocious
for<00:04:46.370> kartha<00:04:46.729> small<00:04:47.000> especially<00:04:47.630> one<00:04:47.810> that's

for kartha small especially one that's

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:57.469 

it<00:04:55.429> should<00:04:56.429> come<00:04:56.579> as<00:04:56.609> no<00:04:56.789> surprise<00:04:56.819> that<00:04:57.179> the

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
it should come as no surprise that the

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.079 
it should come as no surprise that the
fit<00:04:57.659> is<00:04:57.809> better<00:04:58.169> not<00:04:58.889> only<00:04:59.159> is<00:04:59.249> it<00:04:59.369> larger<00:04:59.579> more

00:05:00.079 --> 00:05:00.089 
fit is better not only is it larger more

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:01.519 
fit is better not only is it larger more
powerful<00:05:00.509> and<00:05:00.629> more<00:05:00.809> efficient<00:05:01.259> but<00:05:01.409> it's

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:01.529 
powerful and more efficient but it's

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:03.739 
powerful and more efficient but it's
also<00:05:01.679> a<00:05:01.829> lot<00:05:02.129> quieter<00:05:02.459> and<00:05:02.849> a<00:05:03.179> lot<00:05:03.389> more<00:05:03.419> stable

00:05:03.739 --> 00:05:03.749 
also a lot quieter and a lot more stable

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:06.049 
also a lot quieter and a lot more stable
at<00:05:04.019> highway<00:05:04.169> speeds<00:05:04.619> this<00:05:05.219> alone<00:05:05.519> may<00:05:05.819> help

00:05:06.049 --> 00:05:06.059 
at highway speeds this alone may help

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:07.849 
at highway speeds this alone may help
bump<00:05:06.329> sales<00:05:06.629> but<00:05:06.929> the<00:05:07.019> biggest<00:05:07.229> factor<00:05:07.409> will

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:07.859 
bump sales but the biggest factor will

00:05:07.859 --> 00:05:09.949 
bump sales but the biggest factor will
probably<00:05:08.399> be<00:05:08.579> that<00:05:08.729> Honda<00:05:09.209> has<00:05:09.329> relocated

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:09.959 
probably be that Honda has relocated

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:11.959 
probably be that Honda has relocated
production<00:05:10.379> to<00:05:10.499> Mexico<00:05:10.919> this<00:05:11.519> will<00:05:11.729> allow<00:05:11.909> the

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:11.969 
production to Mexico this will allow the

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:13.879 
production to Mexico this will allow the
company<00:05:12.239> to<00:05:12.569> keep<00:05:12.689> up<00:05:12.899> with<00:05:13.019> any<00:05:13.229> demand<00:05:13.709> that

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
company to keep up with any demand that

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:24.150 
company to keep up with any demand that
