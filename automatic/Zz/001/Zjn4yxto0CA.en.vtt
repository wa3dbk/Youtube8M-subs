in your brain there are billions of

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.559 
in your brain there are billions of
nerve<00:00:04.259> cells<00:00:04.500> and<00:00:04.890> they<00:00:05.040> are<00:00:05.220> making

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:05.569 
nerve cells and they are making

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:08.240 
nerve cells and they are making
trillions<00:00:06.569> perhaps<00:00:07.500> even<00:00:07.770> as<00:00:07.950> some<00:00:08.130> people

our core drill Ian's connections if you

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.400 
our core drill Ian's connections if you
then<00:00:10.769> ask<00:00:11.040> based<00:00:11.490> on<00:00:11.670> how<00:00:12.030> many<00:00:12.410> possible

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
then ask based on how many possible

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.870 
then ask based on how many possible
connections<00:00:13.950> you<00:00:14.040> can<00:00:14.190> make<00:00:14.370> in<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.639> dream

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
connections you can make in the dream

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.840 
connections you can make in the dream
that<00:00:15.389> number<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.500> greater<00:00:16.859> than<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.550> total

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
that number is greater than the total

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.590 
that number is greater than the total
number<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.920> particles<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.279> universe

and<00:00:52.659> I<00:00:52.899> called<00:00:53.199> you<00:00:53.409> on<00:00:53.680> the<00:00:53.739> phone<00:00:53.890> I<00:00:54.519> said<00:00:54.970> can

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
and I called you on the phone I said can

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.410 
and I called you on the phone I said can
you<00:00:55.449> ask<00:00:55.720> your<00:00:55.960> scientific<00:00:56.470> colleagues<00:00:57.420> where

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
you ask your scientific colleagues where

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.680 
you ask your scientific colleagues where
is<00:00:58.809> memory<00:00:59.500> stored<00:01:00.280> at<00:01:00.610> the<00:01:00.670> cellular<00:01:01.390> level

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
is memory stored at the cellular level

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.649 
is memory stored at the cellular level
or<00:01:02.199> how<00:01:02.559> is<00:01:02.769> memory<00:01:03.280> stored<00:01:03.760> and<00:01:04.059> what

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
or how is memory stored and what

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.350 
or how is memory stored and what
happened<00:01:04.989> when<00:01:05.290> you<00:01:05.320> ask<00:01:05.560> them<00:01:06.060> it's<00:01:07.060> funny

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
happened when you ask them it's funny

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.050 
happened when you ask them it's funny
you<00:01:07.600> know<00:01:07.630> when<00:01:08.080> I<00:01:08.110> asked<00:01:08.649> neuroscientists<00:01:09.520> so

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
you know when I asked neuroscientists so

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.810 
you know when I asked neuroscientists so
where<00:01:10.270> a<00:01:10.300> memory<00:01:10.660> stored<00:01:11.009> is<00:01:12.009> always<00:01:12.399> the<00:01:12.580> same

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
where a memory stored is always the same

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.719 
where a memory stored is always the same
response<00:01:13.750> there's<00:01:14.350> some<00:01:14.530> hand<00:01:14.770> waving<00:01:14.979> say

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
response there's some hand waving say

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.730 
response there's some hand waving say

Sanskrit word for it it's called

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.340 
Sanskrit word for it it's called
samskaara<00:03:06.310> so<00:03:07.090> where<00:03:07.510> is<00:03:07.690> your<00:03:07.870> vocabulary

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
samskaara so where is your vocabulary

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.350 
samskaara so where is your vocabulary
stored<00:03:09.100> right<00:03:09.370> now<00:03:09.640> you<00:03:09.910> know<00:03:10.030> you<00:03:10.090> have<00:03:10.330> a

and I are now downloading our vocabulary
in<00:03:16.690> order<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:17.080> make<00:03:17.230> sense<00:03:17.530> of<00:03:17.709> this

in order to make sense of this

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.920 
in order to make sense of this
conversation<00:03:18.250> not<00:03:19.120> only<00:03:19.420> we're<00:03:19.630> downloading

conversation not only we're downloading

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.290 
conversation not only we're downloading
it<00:03:20.440> we're<00:03:20.890> doing<00:03:21.130> it<00:03:21.250> totally<00:03:21.550> effortlessly

it we're doing it totally effortlessly

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.290 
it we're doing it totally effortlessly
and<00:03:22.800> through<00:03:23.800> intention<00:03:24.489> and<00:03:24.610> we<00:03:25.239> are

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
grammar so it makes sense hopefully and

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.850 
grammar so it makes sense hopefully and
