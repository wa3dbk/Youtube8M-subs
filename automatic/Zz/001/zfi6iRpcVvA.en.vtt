00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.160 
feeling heavy and it's feeling that's in
the<00:01:47.939> body<00:01:48.090> defeating<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.750> body<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:49.049> can

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
the body defeating the body you can

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.560 
the body defeating the body you can
detect<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.159> body<00:01:50.340> somewhere<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.450> I'm

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
detect it in the body somewhere so I'm

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.030 
detect it in the body somewhere so I'm
sure<00:01:51.750> you've<00:01:51.899> heard<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.259> saying<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.770> are

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
sure you've heard the saying you are

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.010 
sure you've heard the saying you are
what<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.369> eat<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.729> we<00:01:54.240> are<00:01:54.390> we<00:01:54.600> are<00:01:54.780> what<00:01:54.990> we

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
what you eat and we are we are what we

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.810 
what you eat and we are we are what we
eat<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.470> what<00:01:55.619> we<00:01:55.770> absorb<00:01:56.189> as<00:01:56.369> well<00:01:56.520> because

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
eat and what we absorb as well because

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.429 
eat and what we absorb as well because
we<00:01:56.909> don't<00:01:57.030> absorb<00:01:57.299> everything<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:58.049> but

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
we don't absorb everything and but

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.410 
we don't absorb everything and but
basically<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.799> vibration<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.939> we<00:02:00.090> put<00:02:00.299> into

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
basically the vibration that we put into

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.469 
basically the vibration that we put into
our<00:02:00.509> body<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.840> vibration<00:02:01.560> will<00:02:02.119> go<00:02:03.119> throw<00:02:03.420> it

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
our body that vibration will go throw it

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.350 
our body that vibration will go throw it
us<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:04.200> if<00:02:04.500> we<00:02:04.710> are<00:02:04.860> for<00:02:05.399> example<00:02:05.880> if<00:02:06.090> we're

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
us so if we are for example if we're

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.600 
us so if we are for example if we're
eating<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.229> tortured<00:02:07.770> murdered<00:02:08.009> carcass<00:02:08.520> of

the<00:02:12.810> fear<00:02:13.050> of<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:13.200> animal<00:02:13.590> into<00:02:14.070> our<00:02:14.160> body

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
the fear of that animal into our body

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.700 
the fear of that animal into our body
most<00:02:15.540> animals<00:02:15.810> if<00:02:15.990> you're<00:02:16.080> not<00:02:16.230> quite<00:02:16.440> aware

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
weeks they're taken out and put on

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.680 
weeks they're taken out and put on
people's<00:02:38.610> plates<00:02:38.820> so<00:02:39.000> they<00:02:39.090> can<00:02:39.240> eat<00:02:39.330> them<00:02:39.510> and

people's plates so they can eat them and

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.420 
people's plates so they can eat them and
this<00:02:40.080> so<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.590> first<00:02:40.710> few<00:02:40.920> weeks<00:02:41.010> their<00:02:41.220> life

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.280 
this so the first few weeks their life
until<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:41.730> get<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:41.940> that<00:02:42.090> stage<00:02:42.360> I<00:02:42.780> think<00:02:43.080> 40

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
until I get to that stage I think 40

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.410 
until I get to that stage I think 40
days<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.800> they<00:02:44.400> go<00:02:44.730> through<00:02:44.970> horrible

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
days and they go through horrible

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.640 
days and they go through horrible
horrible<00:02:45.600> conditions<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.260> know<00:02:46.350> it's<00:02:46.470> like

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
horrible conditions you know it's like

horrible conditions you know it's like
being<00:02:46.860> in<00:02:46.980> hell<00:02:47.190> for<00:02:47.430> them<00:02:47.550> so<00:02:48.090> then<00:02:48.570> we're

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
being in hell for them so then we're

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.840 
being in hell for them so then we're
taking<00:02:49.290> those<00:02:49.380> animals<00:02:49.860> we're<00:02:50.490> putting<00:02:50.730> them

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
taking those animals we're putting them

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.390 
taking those animals we're putting them
on<00:02:50.910> our<00:02:51.000> plate<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:51.600> we're<00:02:52.440> eating<00:02:52.710> them<00:02:52.830> so

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
on our plate and we're eating them so

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.030 
on our plate and we're eating them so
we're<00:02:53.580> taking<00:02:53.730> in<00:02:54.060> all<00:02:54.210> that<00:02:54.960> memory<00:02:55.440> all<00:02:55.800> that

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
we're taking in all that memory all that

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.340 
we're taking in all that memory all that
pattern<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:57.150> memory<00:02:57.600> of<00:02:57.630> that<00:02:57.870> animal

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
pattern the memory of that animal

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.590 
pattern the memory of that animal
throughout<00:02:58.680> its<00:02:58.800> whole<00:02:58.950> life<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.550> then<00:03:00.270> when

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
throughout its whole life and then when

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.360 
throughout its whole life and then when
it<00:03:00.690> get<00:03:00.840> killed<00:03:01.080> all<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.500> fear<00:03:01.860> that's<00:03:02.130> going

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370

through its body all the adrenaline and

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.580 
through its body all the adrenaline and
we're<00:03:05.490> taking<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.480> then<00:03:07.050> we're<00:03:07.290> putting

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
we're taking that and then we're putting

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.450 
we're taking that and then we're putting
that<00:03:07.650> into<00:03:07.830> our<00:03:07.950> body<00:03:08.360> so<00:03:09.360> then<00:03:09.510> where<00:03:09.750> I'm

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
that into our body so then where I'm

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.680 
that into our body so then where I'm
going<00:03:11.460> to<00:03:11.520> feel<00:03:11.670> some<00:03:11.820> of<00:03:11.940> that<00:03:12.030> fear<00:03:12.300> we're

going to feel some of that fear we're

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.120 
going to feel some of that fear we're
going<00:03:12.780> to<00:03:12.840> be<00:03:12.960> taking<00:03:13.140> on<00:03:13.440> some<00:03:13.950> of<00:03:14.040> those

going to be taking on some of those
patterns<00:03:14.660> from<00:03:15.660> that<00:03:15.840> animal<00:03:16.340> so<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.520> animals

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
patterns from that animal so the animals

sitting on a little stool make it look
in<00:03:37.800> the<00:03:37.890> car<00:03:38.100> in<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.250> car<00:03:38.640> in<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:38.850> smiley<00:03:39.240> car<00:03:39.480> in

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
this field it's really not like that so

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:42.710 
this field it's really not like that so
you<00:03:41.700> can<00:03:41.910> look<00:03:42.000> into<00:03:42.209> what<00:03:42.330> it's<00:03:42.450> really<00:03:42.630> like

and so they go through this these are

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.940 
and so they go through this these are
disastrous<00:03:46.110> conditions<00:03:46.560> for<00:03:46.680> at<00:03:46.740> the<00:03:46.830> whole
