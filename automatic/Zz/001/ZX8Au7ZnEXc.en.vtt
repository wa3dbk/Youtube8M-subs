00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.990 

that<00:02:35.750> could<00:02:36.230> be<00:02:36.350> for<00:02:36.560> them

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.230 

blow<00:02:39.900> us<00:02:40.080> up<00:02:40.260> or<00:02:40.470> something<00:02:44.090> number<00:02:45.090> five<00:02:47.180> so<00:02:48.180> I

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
blow us up or something number five so I

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.750 
blow us up or something number five so I
might<00:02:48.450> say<00:02:48.690> this<00:02:48.990> animatronic<00:02:49.470> is<00:02:49.980> lousy<00:02:50.220> I

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
might say this animatronic is lousy I

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.690 
might say this animatronic is lousy I
say<00:02:51.690> it<00:02:51.840> scared<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.410> crap<00:02:52.440> out<00:02:53.100> of<00:02:53.130> me<00:02:53.460> as<00:02:53.610> a

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
say it scared the crap out of me as a

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.830 
say it scared the crap out of me as a
child

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:13.300 

just<00:03:01.530> look<00:03:01.950> at<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:05.180> number<00:03:06.180> four

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.730 

I<00:03:13.340> used<00:03:14.270> to<00:03:14.450> cry

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
I used to cry

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.100 
I used to cry
and<00:03:16.280> still<00:03:16.670> packs<00:03:16.970> me<00:03:17.210> today

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.900 

number<00:03:22.110> three<00:03:25.010> this<00:03:26.010> is<00:03:26.130> Captain<00:03:26.520> Rex<00:03:26.700> from

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
number three this is Captain Rex from

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.060 
number three this is Captain Rex from
the<00:03:27.060> cockpit<00:03:27.450> I<00:03:27.660> know<00:03:28.080> this<00:03:28.380> is<00:03:28.500> probably<00:03:28.860> your

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
the cockpit I know this is probably your

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.990 
the cockpit I know this is probably your
first<00:03:29.310> flight<00:03:29.580> and<00:03:29.910> it's<00:03:30.450> mine<00:03:31.230> too<00:03:31.850> well<00:03:32.850> it

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
first flight and it's mine too well it

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.160 
first flight and it's mine too well it
looks<00:03:33.180> like<00:03:33.330> we're<00:03:33.480> going<00:03:33.600> to<00:03:33.750> have<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:33.870> smooth

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
looks like we're going to have a smooth

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.210 
looks like we're going to have a smooth
flight<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:34.620> Endor

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
flight to Endor

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.620 
flight to Endor
so<00:03:35.430> I'll<00:03:35.580> go<00:03:35.760> ahead<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:36.120> open<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.450> cockpit

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
so I'll go ahead and open the cockpit

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.620 
so I'll go ahead and open the cockpit
shield

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.320 

there

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
there

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.440 
there
I<00:03:42.770> see<00:03:43.770> they're<00:03:43.920> moving<00:03:44.220> our<00:03:44.340> navigator<00:03:44.820> r2d2

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
I see they're moving our navigator r2d2

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.940 
I see they're moving our navigator r2d2
and<00:03:46.020> then<00:03:46.200> we'll<00:03:46.350> be<00:03:46.470> on<00:03:46.500> our<00:03:46.650> way

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
and then we'll be on our way

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.220 
and then we'll be on our way
so<00:03:47.490> sit<00:03:47.670> back<00:03:47.700> relax<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:48.570> enjoy<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:50.150> I<00:03:51.230> never

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
so sit back relax and enjoy the I never

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.970 
so sit back relax and enjoy the I never
expected<00:03:53.160> leader<00:03:53.610> ActiveX<00:03:54.330> to<00:03:54.720> be<00:03:54.980> actually

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
expected leader ActiveX to be actually

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.210 
expected leader ActiveX to be actually
be<00:03:56.600> if<00:03:57.600> I<00:03:57.810> would<00:03:57.960> just<00:03:58.170> be<00:03:58.320> likely<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.680> be<00:03:58.980> over

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
be if I would just be likely to be over

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:11.350 
be if I would just be likely to be over
soon
