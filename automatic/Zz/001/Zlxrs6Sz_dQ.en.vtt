00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.329
 steps that was by the lower position by a fire 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:26.539
 to force the negotiations with coercion also on a solution would be too long then 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.989
 the ordinary shares 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:31.899
 three years the young man leaves 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:33.700
 in the world we hear 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.510
 the council of members more 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.780
 the correct value

 that it is not that I am willing to negotiate there 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.950

 able to do 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.770
 the criminal case winner 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.670

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.290
 demands for added value this morning 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.890
 I don't know if this is true 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.270
 just before that 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.480
 but who is 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.770
 the weather is nice 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.469
 standard state of the trainer 

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:08.310
 why 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.650
 but resumed first 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.380
 which is normally two 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.680
 she states that she kept too much distance 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.960
 if I like a good story 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.430

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.730
 waiting in the first row
