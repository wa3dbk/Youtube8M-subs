Lardarius Webb well hello there right

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.969 
Lardarius Webb well hello there right
now<00:01:50.810> but<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.470> what<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.680> looks<00:01:52.829> like

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
now but this is what it looks like

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.499 
now but this is what it looks like
you're<00:01:53.579> going<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.759> get<00:01:53.820> pressure<00:01:54.060> from<00:01:54.240> either

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
you're going to get pressure from either

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.940 
you're going to get pressure from either
the<00:01:54.630> right<00:01:54.869> or<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.079> left<00:01:55.170> edge<00:01:55.530> all<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.920> time

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
the right or the left edge all the time

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.069 
the right or the left edge all the time
lets<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> ball<00:01:56.610> go<00:01:56.670> running<00:01:57.030> back<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.450> which

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
lets the ball go running back in which

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.630 
lets the ball go running back in which
case<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.560> pressure<00:01:58.770> may<00:01:59.009> still<00:01:59.280> get<00:01:59.369> through

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
case the pressure may still get through

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.980 
case the pressure may still get through
if<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.820> Rhinebeck<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.210> on<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.360> right<00:02:00.540> side<00:02:00.810> is

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
if the Rhinebeck is on the right side is

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.600 
if the Rhinebeck is on the right side is
on<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.200> left<00:02:01.380> side<00:02:01.590> pressure<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.130> most<00:02:02.369> likely

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
on the left side pressure is most likely

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.130 
on the left side pressure is most likely
not<00:02:02.729> going<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.240> get<00:02:03.360> through<00:02:05.750> what<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.840> can<00:02:06.990> do

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
not going to get through what you can do

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.320 
not going to get through what you can do
is<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.380> can<00:02:07.409> also<00:02:07.970> control<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.030> middle

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
is you can also control the middle

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.460 
is you can also control the middle
linebacker<00:02:09.690> like<00:02:09.929> you're<00:02:10.050> going<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.229> see<00:02:10.349> me

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
linebacker like you're going to see me

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.860 
linebacker like you're going to see me
do<00:02:10.590> right<00:02:10.770> here<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.310> it

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
do right here and it

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.990 
do right here and it
creates<00:02:12.170> what<00:02:12.650> should<00:02:12.950> be<00:02:12.980> a<00:02:13.340> double-edged

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
creates what should be a double-edged

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.509 
creates what should be a double-edged
heat<00:02:14.569> right<00:02:14.810> there<00:02:15.019> so<00:02:15.739> guys<00:02:16.069> coming<00:02:16.340> from<00:02:16.430> the

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
heat right there so guys coming from the

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:17.949 
heat right there so guys coming from the
left<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:16.849> the<00:02:16.970> right<00:02:17.060> and<00:02:17.420> then<00:02:17.510> you<00:02:17.659> can<00:02:17.810> just

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
left and the right and then you can just

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.949 
left and the right and then you can just
basically<00:02:18.110> take<00:02:18.560> him<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.099> vacate<00:02:19.549> back

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
basically take him and vacate back

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.670 
basically take him and vacate back
there's<00:02:20.959> a<00:02:20.989> lot<00:02:21.080> of<00:02:21.140> different<00:02:21.230> things<00:02:21.470> you

goes<00:02:47.180> I'll<00:02:47.510> control<00:02:47.840> him<00:02:48.049> and<00:02:48.200> just<00:02:48.319> play<00:02:48.500> that

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
goes I'll control him and just play that

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.849 
goes I'll control him and just play that
right<00:02:49.010> side<00:02:49.549> coverage<00:02:50.060> there<00:02:50.709> another<00:02:51.709> thing

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859 
right side coverage there another thing

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:53.140 
right side coverage there another thing
you<00:02:51.920> can<00:02:52.069> do<00:02:52.160> is<00:02:52.340> just<00:02:52.370> control<00:02:52.849> the<00:02:52.879> free

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
you can do is just control the free

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.940 
you can do is just control the free
safety<00:02:53.299> like<00:02:53.629> I'm<00:02:53.750> doing<00:02:53.959> here<00:02:54.170> abandon<00:02:54.799> your

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
safety like I'm doing here abandon your

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.520 
safety like I'm doing here abandon your
deep<00:02:55.220> zone<00:02:55.459> and<00:02:55.730> kind<00:02:55.970> of<00:02:56.120> patrol<00:02:56.720> as<00:02:56.989> a<00:02:57.019> third

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
deep zone and kind of patrol as a third

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.339 
deep zone and kind of patrol as a third
hook<00:02:57.829> to<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.129> other<00:02:58.340> side<00:02:58.989> this<00:02:59.989> goes<00:03:00.200> with

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
hook to the other side this goes with

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:01.780

the assumption that the pressure will

the assumption that the pressure will
get<00:03:02.120> in<00:03:02.390> before<00:03:03.069> you<00:03:04.069> have<00:03:04.819> any<00:03:05.030> threat<00:03:05.359> of

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
going up deep over the top in the middle

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.710 
going up deep over the top in the middle
and<00:03:09.370> that<00:03:10.370> hook<00:03:10.609> zone<00:03:10.819> on<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.180> left<00:03:11.450> side

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
and that hook zone on the left side

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.509 
and that hook zone on the left side
they're<00:03:12.019> usually<00:03:12.440> does<00:03:12.890> a<00:03:12.920> really<00:03:13.250> good<00:03:13.459> job

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
they're usually does a really good job

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.030 
they're usually does a really good job
of<00:03:13.720> preventing<00:03:14.720> quick<00:03:15.170> throws<00:03:15.470> down<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:15.739> seam

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
of preventing quick throws down the seam

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.740 
of preventing quick throws down the seam
especially<00:03:16.519> if<00:03:16.609> you<00:03:16.760> do<00:03:16.940> coverage<00:03:17.359> over<00:03:17.660> the

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
especially if you do coverage over the

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.370 
especially if you do coverage over the

here<00:03:38.989> is<00:03:39.200> just<00:03:39.230> to<00:03:39.590> baseline<00:03:39.919> and<00:03:40.370> crash<00:03:40.609> the

here is just to baseline and crash the

here is just to baseline and crash the
line<00:03:40.910> down<00:03:41.120> but<00:03:41.989> i<00:03:42.260> like<00:03:42.500> to<00:03:42.680> move<00:03:42.799> the

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
line down but i like to move the

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.890 
line down but i like to move the
linebackers<00:03:43.400> over<00:03:43.699> so<00:03:43.879> that<00:03:43.910> it<00:03:44.120> doesn't<00:03:44.629> it

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
linebackers over so that it doesn't it

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.750 
linebackers over so that it doesn't it
doesn't<00:03:44.959> stack<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.859> left<00:03:46.099> side<00:03:46.280> as<00:03:46.400> much<00:03:46.549> so

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
doesn't stack the left side as much so

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.830 
doesn't stack the left side as much so
people<00:03:46.970> going<00:03:47.090> to<00:03:47.150> run<00:03:47.299> to<00:03:47.389> the<00:03:47.419> right<00:03:47.629> if<00:03:47.750> you

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
people going to run to the right if you

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.509 
people going to run to the right if you
don't<00:03:47.989> move<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.500> linebackers<00:03:48.949> out<00:03:49.069> there<00:03:49.250> so

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
don't move the linebackers out there so

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.210 
don't move the linebackers out there so
that's<00:03:50.359> why<00:03:50.599> i<00:03:50.629> do<00:03:50.780> that<00:03:51.079> but<00:03:51.680> overall<00:03:52.010> guys

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
that's why i do that but overall guys

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.039 
that's why i do that but overall guys
