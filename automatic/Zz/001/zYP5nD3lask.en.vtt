00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 nice guys are disappointed i am here today 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.910
 with this new comment on su call of 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.519
 duty ghost is a commentary on one 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.820
 We played in the group 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.679
 I enjoy it at the gamesweek 2013 I will try to 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.910
 be a little short because ai 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.590
 activision guys gave us some 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.900
 directives for making this video that 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.510
 should be as short as possible and 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.070
 more than anything else for not saying violate the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.960
 copyright of 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.189
 of activision precisely so as not to 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.689
 let us take away the gameplay 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.720
 then we say that this new chapter 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.900
 it is a very very fluid game I say 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.360
 that this year they played a game that 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.970
 is the merger between mv 3 and what it is 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.890
 been the black ops 27 boys in my opinion 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.420
 bmw thrashers annoyed very high we say 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.160
 that also the change of weapon to say 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.160
 the entry of the equipment when yes 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.960
 press the rb key all these small ones 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.820
 things that make it seem new but 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.629
 however they also belong to old people 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.149
 chapters like given already mentioned mp3 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:59.340
 then what else is all the weapons again 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.360
 they are all new are not remakes of 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.060
 old games or remakes of weapons that 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.890
 they exist but they are weapons that look like 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.940
 but totally new you have the maps 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.960
 very large with tunnels are large but 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.240
 confusion let's say why the players 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.460
 they always meet never get lost 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.320
 very cool as what because people that 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.320
 therefore, the sniper is always found 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.060
 it does not remain as black ops 2 than not 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.220
 find players who are struggling to do 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.619
 kill you don't killstreak precisely for 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.710
 the graphic one, however, I must say that 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.020
 then some maps have improved a lot 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.580
 new are dynamic when I remember 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.850
 I think this map was called 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.020
 chasma if I 'm not mistaken and in the center of the 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.030
 map there is a 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.500
 there are some tubes that fall out of me 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.000
 I remember well, however, we tried 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.130
 a map where there are objects 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.009
 dynamic that interact with us and is 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.079
 a really absurd cool they put 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.700
 new new player movements for 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.040
 example when in black ops two like 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.110
 as you will remember when you run yes 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.540
 press and hold the button to crouch 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.479
 let's say he threw himself instead mentioned here 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.670
 slips and is a let's say movement of 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.950
 extra player a new thing one thing 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.780
 which makes it even more different 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.870
 we say from others by the other chapters 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.090
 as I said before it takes up a lot of mv 3 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.459
 also for the series of engravings indeed 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.980
 the series is hidden in the support series 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.530
 the selection is also very broad 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.470
 of weapons of accessories the selection of 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.630
 series of killings and therefore renders 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.700
 even more cool gaming experience 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.519
 in fact there were many things with us 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.139
 however we could try 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.910
 some series of killings they require 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:37.739
 many killings some weapons yes 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.299
 unlock at the high level we have 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.680
 let's say we tried a bit of everything 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.169
 we found to the parties more 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.489
 important of this game I don't know 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:46.019
 what else to add guys too 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.639
 because I believe you have also seen the 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.350
 other videos of the other boys 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:51.540
 I highly recommend this game 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.040
 even if I tried it very little we say that 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.900
 it was enough to understand a little 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.260
 this year also with the release of the next 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.449
 January 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.519
 infinity ward made me a masterpiece 

00:02:57.449 --> 00:03:01.650
 I am very happy to have seen and 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.660
 having tried this game we kids there 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.410
 see you at the next video from deluxe is 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.410
 all beautiful
