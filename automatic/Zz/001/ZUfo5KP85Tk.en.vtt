00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.110
 why do you need the patriarch today 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.579
 visited 

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:10.130
 surely it is very beautiful 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.810
 effectively completed with cinematic 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.410
 headquarters that made himself 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.700
 misses 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.039
 Kupriyanov principle having quite 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.900
 good but that is their game that went for 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.699
 Recently, the percentage of Kupriyanov 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.140
 just bored with too often if 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.560
 q3 was previously perceived as 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.410
 what's so long when we see there 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.810
 played in what we fall rub kg 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.080
 Debt Driving Digit Digit 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.600
 interest duration 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.320
 now just asked 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.950
 bored very much bored Sergey when 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:40.460
 i.e 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.260
 just tried saying they have there 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.290
 prc 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.040
 bundle and output from this client is audible 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.360
 just but beautifully cut 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.850
 just exactly several volumes 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.640
 and can he get bored? 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.260
 and for this everyone complains about it not bad it 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.430
 just get caught not brought 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.550
 I don't know, I don't know 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.530
 argue with that but I have 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.980
 opinion 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.420
 that's good 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.259
 and all that is something other than Chinese lawyers 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.530
 something that did not like and now these 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.950
 that's 8 points 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.100
 but it is reported that something very much wants 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.100
 puts but i failed the first and 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.780
 opinion that I did not like varieties 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.850
 First of all 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.020
 I didn’t like what many look like 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.110
 characters just 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.850
 and if with author killer principle very 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.350
 good model to wholesale example or 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.180
 whether the process can die from fear 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.410
 pull out the console is the other end of the rooms 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.180
 because the note is terrible, but what is it about 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.590
 that Ms. frustrates animation if 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.250
 when Ukrainian sailors in the delivery room 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.090
 answers their option then for some reason not 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.790
 move very realistic that's when 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.080
 many characters screen saver begins 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.060
 crisis how much to be isolated 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.790
 and because if you are not a camel you can 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.670
 say that the experience also scares me not 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.680
 understandable as a rule of this magnitude is not 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.680
 could get such things 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.039
 out 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.039
 frankly speaking 

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:16.789
 model flaws 

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:21.179
 I am not particularly pitiable 

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:23.509
 that I really astrologer 

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:26.349
 so this is not always an adequate system 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.220
 restore her opponents 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.980
 however it is rather natural 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.980
 because finding our way to the goal 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.029
 can not simultaneously rush one 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:37.699
 a dozen fir-trees 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:40.339
 and system genius works three 

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:43.099
 valve candidate 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.279
 enemy assets and framing instead 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:48.189
 guided by some remote 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:50.560
 sniper who basically entered also 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.469
 does not see the ship at all busy with their business 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:54.050
 but 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.619
 because of this price 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:57.309
 can put in charge of the health of the main 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:59.759
 character and 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:01.199
 especially if you play high 

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:03.219
 difficulty level that mental health 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.519
 and if the nerves suffered 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:06.849
 opisthorchiasis customs 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.340
 I definitely have no such problems 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.299
 arose 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.169
 in composition 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:14.229
 and one another for the fact that 

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:15.859
 all and here it is kovalev 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.859
 if which were valid 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.700
 and exporters several levels she 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.399
 there is someone 

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:26.229
 on Wednesday of what was there 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:28.629
 time when we are just 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:30.969
 first met demos watched 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:32.210
 first video 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.879
 thought of myself imagine that here 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.999
 what time can help do this 

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:36.489
 strength 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:37.529
 and why 

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:39.279
 and prohibits from can be cut 

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:41.899
 percent less items can 

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:43.599
 missed and so on 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.409
 in the final version of the game which however 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.939
 twist thousand catching heard 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:49.060
 Yes and no 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.699
 over the years even ruby ​​has the same major 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:53.099
 we can make it go to the door 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.739
 which open thorn japan 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.399
 telekinesis before the collapse of the duties itself 

00:03:57.399 --> 00:03:59.479
 yourself in the genre is not so bad 

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:02.479
 but I would like to very 

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:07.199
 however, no matter how cool but in my opinion 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:08.730
 the main advantage of the game 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.299
 need more finnish 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:11.589
 central character around 

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:14.030
 which rotates the whole country of the game 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.839
 atlantis 

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:17.329
 a circle for the same amount 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:18.689
 start of the stage can not him 

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:21.389
 resist even the strength of the date of this like that 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.289
 questioned lange luch tv them 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:27.650
 always achieves goals but 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.180
 unfortunately the script is pretty 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.069
 it is from what often suffers but 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:36.039
 probably that's why you want to 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:37.759
 he is fresh from a million to ng 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:39.669
 supervisor ploshchenko all 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.199
 unanimously disagreed on one opinion 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.159
 caution somali cathedral to growth 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.340
 got caught 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.830
 one hundred percent probably yes if there is 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.360
 disadvantages 10 years 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.409
 some fear and characters yes 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:53.800
 to go through the aggregate lungs 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.919
 four more seconds 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:58.669
 fourth most qualified 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:04:59.710
 where is the level 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.689
 but maybe in those who 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:03.319
 very much the same at all 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:04.309
 levels and 

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:07.289
 In principle, yes, you can not force Obama taking 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:09.639
 weightiness boys commander there under 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:12.609
 I do not know the land, but at the same time everything is a game 

00:05:12.609 --> 00:05:14.629
 allows you to do so much 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:16.809
 interesting and new that we never before 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:18.029
 not done 

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:19.610
 expected not 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.110
 in general sense 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.529
 all this all these flaws I ask 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:25.839
 I think everyone 

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:27.399
 they are just a fan of star wars 

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:29.939
 it's just that they bred some kind of console 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:31.469
 which networks are grad 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:32.879
 mandatory to see and evaluate 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:33.409
 myself
