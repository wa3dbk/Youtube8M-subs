00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:12.200
 Hello dear angler today 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:16.710
 I would like to talk to you 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:19.769
 resuscitation silicone bait once 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.890
 This is done both started fishing 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:25.259
 spinning I was about fifteen because 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.529
 that they were quite expensive there 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:31.340
 soldered right now basically a horse all 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.290
 Has horse bait changed a lot 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.079
 It is relatively inexpensive, that is 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.800
 In principle, probably many do not 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.870
 but in general, the experience of the last fishing 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.640
 Generally such circumstances are different about 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.340
 the fact that all the same sometimes you can do it 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.289
 photo started my experience go lure with 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.960
 This lure I soldered white with a long 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:00.899
 tail with such a body and this one 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.500
 Star map once caught its record and 7 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.240
 perch and 4 perch with a total weight of 15 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.280
 kilo of course maybe there is on 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.920
 there was another twister in its place 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.210
 I also don't know, but this is the first mor 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.869
 my hand-made once 15 years very 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.549
 It worked well and therefore the last 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.450
 fishing which was literally a month 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.189
 back with so you assassins was just 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.829
 only one bait just no buy 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.250
 He can not be here on this gnawing away 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.509
 I tail soldered such 3 I had and 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.479
 procos 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:40.150
 a rose is not a rose Markovna 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:44.690
 and now on this one 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:47.300
 dinner because there was a collapse of the tail 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.480
 many poklevok there to 20 Sudak 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.450
 was caught like that just didn't blow up 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:57.620
 Therefore, it is said sometimes you can 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:00.350
 do here plus here such worms for example 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.660
 action plastic work very well by 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.560
 perch on zander me such this year 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:09.050
 but their tails are bite off just 1 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:13.670
 2 and generally two or three bites to them 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.230
 the end therefore first and left the foot 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.820
 bait is not always easy to get 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.540
 no need to throw out 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:23.240
 you can screen the world how here 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.520
 such old tails red different 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.400
 flowers and starov cut out similar 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.250
 tails and solder the solder at home on 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.940
 comfort or fishing is possible 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.820
 make sure to advise you to have one 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.330
 lighters with a mesh of them flame 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.250
 passes a certain 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.200
 certain size in the wind is not gaston 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.920
 very comfortable watered by our others not 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.070
 very comfortable throat and here you are animated 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.890

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.640
 tail him from twister cut that is 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.220
 It was delicious I wanted to choose, but why? 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.320
 about to make a worm 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.930
 mena did not water just in half was 1 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.810
 chickens this three-piece worth worms 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.770
 can you imagine it all okay 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.989

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.050
 say therefore do not rush to throw out 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.020
 your old bait is quite possible 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:46.920
 solder it for long and at the same time they 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:50.720
 are satisfied with catchy here in 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:55.880
