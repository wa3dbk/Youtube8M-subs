00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
and just to say afterwards which makes

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.359 
and just to say afterwards which makes

very positive but you know I really

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.679 
very positive but you know I really
can't<00:01:38.610> evolve<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.030> another<00:01:39.270> point<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.540> can

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
can't evolve is another point you can

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.960 
can't evolve is another point you can
get<00:01:39.840> these<00:01:39.990> ones<00:01:40.259> easily<00:01:40.799> Perry<00:01:41.460> if<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.790> go

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970
