I<00:02:17.560> always<00:02:17.860> put<00:02:18.130> that<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.550> front<00:02:18.940> so<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.950> the

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
I always put that to the front so to the

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.860 
I always put that to the front so to the
right<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.530> front<00:02:24.060> okay<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.300> then<00:02:25.420> go<00:02:25.450> back

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
right to the front okay and then go back

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.020 
right to the front okay and then go back
and<00:02:26.140> forth<00:02:26.410> like<00:02:26.500> that<00:02:26.920> keeping<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:27.820> pretty

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
and forth like that keeping it pretty

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.660 
and forth like that keeping it pretty
tight<00:02:28.390> you<00:02:28.720> want<00:02:29.320> to<00:02:29.440> keep<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:29.800> all<00:02:29.950> untangled

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
tight you want to keep it all untangled

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.740 
tight you want to keep it all untangled
down<00:02:30.850> here<00:02:31.330> and<00:02:32.340> so<00:02:33.340> just<00:02:34.180> back<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:34.690> forth

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
down here and so just back and forth

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:41.160 
down here and so just back and forth
like<00:02:35.290> that<00:02:38.100> till<00:02:39.100> you<00:02:39.190> get<00:02:39.370> maybe<00:02:39.700> about<00:02:40.170> I

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
like that till you get maybe about I

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.910 
like that till you get maybe about I
don't<00:02:42.070> know<00:02:42.450> 12<00:02:43.450> inches<00:02:43.870> or<00:02:44.050> so<00:02:44.290> from<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.770> end

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
don't know 12 inches or so from the end

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.950 
don't know 12 inches or so from the end
because<00:02:45.190> you<00:02:45.340> want<00:02:45.520> some<00:02:45.790> excess<00:02:46.720> to<00:02:47.620> do<00:02:47.800> your

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
because you want some excess to do your

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.530 
because you want some excess to do your
Cobra<00:02:49.960> weave<00:02:50.200> at<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.650> end<00:02:51.120> all<00:02:52.120> right<00:02:52.150> so<00:02:52.450> I'm

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
Cobra weave at the end all right so I'm

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.140 
Cobra weave at the end all right so I'm
going<00:02:52.660> to<00:02:52.690> continue<00:02:53.230> this<00:02:53.410> round<00:02:54.370> braid<00:02:54.700> here

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
going to continue this round braid here

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.900 
going to continue this round braid here
all<00:02:55.990> the<00:02:56.260> way<00:02:56.380> down<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:56.860> I'll<00:02:56.950> pick<00:02:57.670> back<00:02:57.850> up

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
all the way down and I'll pick back up

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.230 
all the way down and I'll pick back up
when<00:02:58.300> I<00:02:58.420> get<00:02:58.480> down<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:59.020> end<00:02:59.140> okay<00:03:00.060> I'm<00:03:01.060> down

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
when I get down to the end okay I'm down

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.720 
when I get down to the end okay I'm down
here<00:03:01.300> at<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.870> end<00:03:02.110> I<00:03:02.440> have<00:03:02.800> about<00:03:03.040> 10<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.459> 12

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
here at the end I have about 10 to 12

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.920 
here at the end I have about 10 to 12
inches<00:03:04.209> of<00:03:05.400> 550<00:03:06.400> cord<00:03:06.580> left<00:03:06.940> and<00:03:07.570> what<00:03:07.840> you

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
inches of 550 cord left and what you

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.690 
inches of 550 cord left and what you
want<00:03:08.080> to<00:03:08.110> do<00:03:08.230> is<00:03:08.350> you<00:03:08.440> want<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.650> separate<00:03:09.220> you

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
want to do is you want to separate you

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.280 
want to do is you want to separate you
know<00:03:09.730> have<00:03:10.000> one<00:03:10.209> of<00:03:10.360> each<00:03:10.450> color<00:03:10.750> over<00:03:11.080> here

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
know have one of each color over here

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.620 
know have one of each color over here
one<00:03:11.500> of<00:03:11.620> each<00:03:11.740> color<00:03:11.980> over<00:03:12.370> here<00:03:12.700> and<00:03:12.880> then

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
one of each color over here and then

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.300 
one of each color over here and then
what<00:03:13.780> you're<00:03:13.900> going<00:03:14.020> to<00:03:14.080> do<00:03:14.290> is<00:03:14.590> on<00:03:14.920> this<00:03:15.160> end

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
what you're going to do is on this end

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.390 
what you're going to do is on this end
you<00:03:15.790> have<00:03:16.030> this<00:03:16.240> little<00:03:16.540> loop<00:03:17.040> this<00:03:18.040> is<00:03:18.250> where

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
you have this little loop this is where

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.710 
you have this little loop this is where
I<00:03:18.430> use<00:03:18.730> my<00:03:18.910> forceps<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:19.750> I<00:03:21.209> took<00:03:22.209> it<00:03:22.360> in<00:03:22.480> there

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
I use my forceps and I took it in there

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.920 
I use my forceps and I took it in there
and<00:03:22.989> I<00:03:23.050> take<00:03:25.769> two<00:03:26.769> of<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.330> you<00:03:28.330> know<00:03:28.360> ends

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
and I take two of the you know ends

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.300 
and I take two of the you know ends
opposite<00:03:29.410> colors<00:03:29.800> again<00:03:30.190> and<00:03:30.630> I<00:03:31.920> just<00:03:32.920> pull<00:03:33.160> it

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
opposite colors again and I just pull it

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.050 
opposite colors again and I just pull it
through<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:38.170> loop<00:03:38.380> there<00:03:38.709> at<00:03:38.860> the<00:03:39.010> end<00:03:39.190> okay

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
through the loop there at the end okay

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.930 
through the loop there at the end okay
and<00:03:40.239> then<00:03:40.360> that's<00:03:40.540> how<00:03:40.720> I<00:03:40.750> kind<00:03:41.080> of<00:03:41.230> connect

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
and then that's how I kind of connect

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.680 
and then that's how I kind of connect
the<00:03:44.010> two<00:03:45.010> ends<00:03:45.280> together<00:03:45.700> to<00:03:46.030> make<00:03:46.390> the<00:03:46.540> loop

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
the two ends together to make the loop

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.820 
the two ends together to make the loop
now<00:03:46.870> obviously<00:03:47.350> that's<00:03:47.620> a<00:03:47.739> lot<00:03:47.950> smaller<00:03:48.430> than

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
now obviously that's a lot smaller than

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.420 
now obviously that's a lot smaller than
what<00:03:50.830> you<00:03:51.010> need<00:03:51.250> it<00:03:51.430> but<00:03:52.590> for<00:03:53.590> teaching

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
what you need it but for teaching

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.930 
what you need it but for teaching
purposes<00:03:54.900> it'll<00:03:55.900> work<00:03:56.310> alright<00:03:57.310> so<00:03:57.580> here's

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
purposes it'll work alright so here's

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:58.790 
purposes it'll work alright so here's
what<00:03:58.150> we<00:03:58.269> have

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
what we have

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.080 
what we have
okay<00:03:59.800> we<00:04:00.010> have<00:04:00.130> the<00:04:00.250> two<00:04:00.430> pieces<00:04:00.700> going

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
okay we have the two pieces going

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.660 
okay we have the two pieces going
through<00:04:01.360> the<00:04:01.450> loop<00:04:01.630> coming<00:04:02.410> down<00:04:02.739> and<00:04:03.130> that's

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
through the loop coming down and that's

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.340 
through the loop coming down and that's
what<00:04:03.880> you're<00:04:04.030> going<00:04:04.120> to<00:04:04.180> use<00:04:04.480> to<00:04:04.510> connect<00:04:05.080> this

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
what you're going to use to connect this

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.199 
what you're going to use to connect this
side<00:04:05.620> release<00:04:05.950> buckle<00:04:06.370> and<00:04:06.550> then<00:04:06.670> these<00:04:06.910> two

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
side release buckle and then these two

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:08.790 
side release buckle and then these two
pieces<00:04:07.480> that<00:04:07.720> are<00:04:07.930> hanging<00:04:08.380> off<00:04:08.470> on<00:04:08.709> the

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
pieces that are hanging off on the

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.710 
pieces that are hanging off on the
outsides<00:04:09.310> those<00:04:10.030> are<00:04:10.180> going<00:04:10.299> to<00:04:10.390> be<00:04:10.540> what

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
outsides those are going to be what

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.479 
outsides those are going to be what
you're<00:04:10.870> going<00:04:10.989> to<00:04:11.019> use<00:04:11.080> to<00:04:11.440> make<00:04:11.620> your<00:04:11.680> Cobra

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
you're going to use to make your Cobra

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.780 
you're going to use to make your Cobra
weave<00:04:12.730> so<00:04:13.690> now<00:04:13.900> these<00:04:14.170> two<00:04:14.230> pieces<00:04:14.790> hanging

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
weave so now these two pieces hanging

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.719 
weave so now these two pieces hanging
down<00:04:16.090> in<00:04:16.239> the<00:04:16.330> middle<00:04:16.660> I'm<00:04:17.019> going<00:04:17.080> to<00:04:18.010> attach

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
down in the middle I'm going to attach

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:23.360 
down in the middle I'm going to attach
my<00:04:19.799> lanyard<00:04:20.799> side<00:04:21.609> release<00:04:22.000> buckle<00:04:22.510> and

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
my lanyard side release buckle and

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.500 
my lanyard side release buckle and
sometimes<00:04:24.370> it's<00:04:24.610> kind<00:04:24.669> of<00:04:24.850> difficult<00:04:24.910> to

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
sometimes it's kind of difficult to

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.800 
sometimes it's kind of difficult to
poke<00:04:26.960> these<00:04:27.230> things<00:04:27.560> in<00:04:27.830> here<00:04:28.390> one<00:04:29.390> thing<00:04:29.630> that

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
poke these things in here one thing that

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.510 
poke these things in here one thing that
I<00:04:29.840> suggest<00:04:29.990> that<00:04:30.680> I'm<00:04:30.800> actually<00:04:31.010> going<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.400> do

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
I suggest that I'm actually going to do

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.570 
I suggest that I'm actually going to do
that<00:04:31.550> is<00:04:31.880> to<00:04:32.560> when<00:04:33.560> you<00:04:33.680> melt<00:04:33.950> the<00:04:34.040> end<00:04:34.310> this

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
that is to when you melt the end this
