00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.710
 to be the commercial director of 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.140
 pagesjaunes and so I have a team 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.540
 around me from commercial field and 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.639
 of telemarketers and this is a 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.469
 direction which represents 3500 people 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.869
 with about a billion euros type 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.920
 I started with the job 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.750
 from commercial I entered at 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.010
 yellow pages as a seller and then 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.580
 then I did a lot of jobs and 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.539
 I first did management and then I 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.519
 took care of the subsidiaries 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.260
 yesterday day I was offered the direction 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.480
 commercial of pagesjaunes not cleared 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.920
 a lot of career I have not 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.960
 wii games what gave you 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.469
 want and frosty you are the taste of 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.300
 contact 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.370
 I think that when we want to do this 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.629
 job is above all to meet 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.250
 people I have not join to the 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.200
 particularity to meet several 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.270
 universe different types of customers on 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.070
 can see at a small business the 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.989
 morning and a marketing director 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.850
 in the afternoon to be empowered 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.469
 also on his activity to be autonomous 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.480
 to be in charge of turnover 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.859
 so all these elements gave me the 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.340
 taste for sale and from when of 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.019
 my studies 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.180
 as soon as I started my studies I had 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.490
 this sensitivity there I work it 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.990
 was in contact with customers and I had 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:18.180
 want to go on an orientation 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:19.950
 more difficult commercial I would say of 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.290
 give back every day to hand all 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.180
 the days to zero the counters at once 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.509
 in questioning both on these 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.650
 statistics 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.960
 but above all in terms of restoration 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.960
 Because recovers question what's the 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:36.299
 real challenge and commercial then you 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.200
 have a lot of commercials so we have 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.909
 a number of levers of 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.250
 motivation we have a management 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.299
 intermediary who is in charge 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.520
 accompaniment and motivation of 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.409
 commercial and then classically the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.570
 incentive systems incentives 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.520
 there in a few days I go to 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.229
 marrakech with 200 of them in 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.520
 a few weeks in miami with the 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.689
 best of them here are some 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.020
 some classic animation tools 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:00.609
 to go back to the trades of 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.990
 martial according to you your trading 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:04.600
 because at the same time prospecting 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.640
 so we have in our sales channels 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.210
 dedicated to prospecting 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.459
 it's the job 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.690
 we have more than 300 telemarketers doing 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.209
 prospecting every day they 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.489
 call dozens of customers from 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.180
 prospects and who realizes one to two 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.610
 sales per day 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.480
 after the commercial field based 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.250
 of his appetence will make 10 to 15% of 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.010
 its prospecting activity is what 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.569
 you like respect more I think that 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.370
 all sales managers are 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.630
 to be that their sales prospects 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.599
 more yes no it's not enough 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.829
 we have six hundred thousand customers out of 4 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.910
 million businesses so we still have 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.170
 market shares to fetch 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.640
 so prospecting is a real asset 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:47.200
 what advice could you give to 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.190
 young salesmen then the council 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.900
 it really is the school of courage 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.410
 prospecting go see customers 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.720
 existing 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.069
 it's loyalty prospecting 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.450
 it's the school of courage so you have to 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.200
 know wiped names you have to know 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.140
 open doors 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.160
 we must forget to make a number I 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.480
 go back to a customer he told me no 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.950
 I forgot and I go right away 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.359
 the next one is really the school of 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.459
 courage and then a lot of networking 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.069
 that is to say to contact people 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.630
 go to trade shows 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.630
 go for a hunt there is the instinct of the hunter 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.420
 and proud then usually it's the 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.730
 banks that are the most difficult 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.440
 which we are most proud of 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.940
 so today I want to say that my 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.859
 main selling the vis-Ã -vis my 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.299
 collaborators so if I have to be proud 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.829
 of a sale this is what I propose all 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.319
 the days my collaborators but in 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.840
 as commercial if I have in memory 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.519
 a sale it was the one that was the 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.230
 more complicated it is the client told me 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.849
 no and in the end she told me listen I 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.930
 told you not on purpose to know if 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.340
 you were able to defend your 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.650
 product it could only excite or 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.120
 oh that was when the client was called 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.129
 sir reindeer vladimir reindeer they 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.569
 were of the rental vehicle 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:53.780
 luxury 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:56.540
 now go too bad will make a 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.069
 twenty years old sat to his 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.069
 Mark 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:04.280
 to finish what do you think of the concept of 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.720
 exchange of contacts and I think that 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.790
 that's the meaning of the story I think that 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.340
 more and more network the networks 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.450
 social benefits come into the lives of all 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.010
 days we can see that our children 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.569
 spend their time on the networks 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.010
 social networks we have professional networks 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.209
 who are developing 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.269
 so I think that's the meaning of 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.269
 the story
