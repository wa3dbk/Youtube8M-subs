and artists aren't being compensated in

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.130 
and artists aren't being compensated in
the<00:00:43.649> way<00:00:43.770> they<00:00:43.980> were<00:00:44.040> in<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.399> past<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:45.570> what<00:00:45.899> if

the way they were in the past so what if

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.100 
the way they were in the past so what if

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
different way so I had this idea to pay

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.529 
different way so I had this idea to pay
artists<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.870> walk<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.699> vision<00:00:56.699> one<00:00:56.969> walk<00:00:57.239> is

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
artists to walk and vision one walk is

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.599 
artists to walk and vision one walk is
the<00:00:57.719> manifestation<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.800> dream<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.370> did

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
the manifestation of that dream I did

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.080 
the manifestation of that dream I did
some<00:00:59.850> casual<00:01:00.329> research<00:01:00.840> about<00:01:01.940> artists<00:01:02.940> who

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
some casual research about artists who

walk<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.629> find<00:01:03.870> out<00:01:04.049> if<00:01:04.320> they<00:01:04.559> liked<00:01:05.040> walking

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
walk to find out if they liked walking

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.100 
walk to find out if they liked walking
if<00:01:05.610> they<00:01:05.729> used<00:01:06.030> walking<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.570> be<00:01:06.689> more<00:01:06.900> creative

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
if they used walking to be more creative

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.800 
if they used walking to be more creative
and<00:01:07.619> what<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.220> found<00:01:08.640> out<00:01:09.000> was<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
and what I found out was that the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.980 
and what I found out was that the
majority<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.470> artists<00:01:11.159> walk<00:01:11.939> at<00:01:12.360> some<00:01:12.689> point

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
majority of artists walk at some point

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.560 
majority of artists walk at some point
