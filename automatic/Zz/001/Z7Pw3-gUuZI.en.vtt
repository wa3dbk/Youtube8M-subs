00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.690
 so hello to all unwelcome here to 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.649
 shader model to the 1.51 so you see 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.090
 right now we are right on the desktop 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.400
 then I can thank you because of that 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.389
 installation show below me clicks 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.009
 Just look at the link in the 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.870
 description then you have only one 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.580
 thing in the country though is a veteran 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.230
 Schiefner just clicks on media fire 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.270
 on download but just me so big 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.070
 then just go ok and unfortunately you 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.500
 you the windows phone as easy 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.619
 shader 15.1 just does one 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.910
 double-click on it and then you see, too 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.070
 already what we are here for three files 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.850
 get the latest song shelter 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.380
 from sonic he saw the sollstedter for the 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.969
 15.1 and if deep one 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.829
 so first of all she has something after that 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.930
 are you doing minecraft turns on here 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.910
 always and then you go first 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.320
 options and makes first in force 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.360
 update then goes to login 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.860
 and that is then update first because 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.539
 then when you update your minecraft 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.370
 it is very small and so without 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.289
 Anything else from that murder 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.550
 such a diligently works 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.270
 in the meantime that was just down 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.340
 I can give you a few 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.989
 if somehow give information 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.730
 problem or something with the shader then 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.769
 write below the comments or something 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.299
 I'll try your questions or yours 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.830
 maybe to solve problems or something and so 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.080
 of course, then write to me if I am 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.060
 or I write you then the the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.500
 Solution or when I do not have the error 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.280
 I just can not shake her 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.439
 can fix 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.259
 and yes I'm definitely to 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.420
 available to help you with such 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.500
 already mojang be it so data revealed 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.420
 come close attack 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.860
 and then you give it down to the search 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.040
 So start on the search 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.170
 percent off as data percent on 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.400
 you simply suppress or we are 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.650
 already here in the point minecraft 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.150
 folder so the shield attacks or 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.820
 just double click on it 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.079
 then go to the stage and see 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.520
 we there the minecraft yes then we come 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.460
 Just open the right mouse click 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.200
 will ship with winrar so that now 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.689
 well already open well close 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.280
 Close to the very first in what they 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.170
 Minecraft year power is the medium 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.040
 just raft away and the anja 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.469
 so that the mails are deleted and open 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.219
 we first in the shader 15.1 folder 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.200
 whether the fine so several bank control 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.710
 untie all folders and then drag 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.869
 everything was great 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.239
 also dot point folder you can 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.530
 wegmachen again 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.659
 that was about as all whether the fine 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.719
 then we should open faster 1.5 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:16.859
 point 1 emphasized again 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.719
 Control but then everything again 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:22.170
 selected and are the whole 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:23.219
 files back into the archive and that 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.620
 it was actually already from the 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:28.260
 all installation from the shader if you want 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.480
 now minecraft starts I do mine 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.170
 times to login 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.099
 probably a bit there now 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.939
 just record faster and so on 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.230
 then you will already see when we open 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:40.560
 options we have now go here 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.469
 new option shaders as well as her here 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.669
 which reinbekommt you go just once 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:47.010
 Show you now again he goes 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:48.659
 on open starter packs or if the here 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.489
 actually I do not believe any 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:52.439
 I just have a lot of old ones here 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.090
 and new and ill shaders and everything 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:56.310
 should somehow wanted to have one of them 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.719
 and that several want to have then 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.280
 we also want to make a video 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:00.959
 But I ask you a definitely 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.969
 to dispose of and to the newest 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:08.040
 shader v10 rc 7 version ultra that counts 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:10.650
 you just then in the shader packs 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.030
 folder and then she became too passive 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.859
 then added them will be easy 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.750
 Here's where it is in the cdu here 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:20.609
 such rather tough and rancid 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.889
 Just click on it then it will work 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.000
 and then you actually have here 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:26.359
 even shader in there I give you 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.359
 my world 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.989
 We already have the shader in there 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.549
 I'm just doing the picture a bit 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.169
 bigger than would put because I 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.030
 just recording with fraps in full screen 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:37.769
 and my pc is not the best 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.329
 So I'll tell you so you already need 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.519
 pretty good pc for that 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.810
 and if you're wondering then 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.389
 Do not you wonder why the shader maybe 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.859
 with you a little bit was 40 degrees 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.109
 the newest one but i can get the shader one 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.849
 otherwise usually play and in the 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.139
 year for example could be to another job 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.599
 like I have for example nor the 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:56.340
 normal but specific settings 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.979
 sowed, for example, often runs again 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.379
 directly liquid a bit of setting a 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:02.159
 and without water because of the shader 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.759
 I give you 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:07.799
 the song with the beautiful water should be the 

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:09.900
 sv 10 rc he is also beautiful 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.389
 we just have to show water here 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.780
 the beautiful water and my year 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:17.639
 favorite shader is the rc sixth and 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.010
 Although here I had the city â€‹â€‹play 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.540
 Just get that way and in winter 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.790
 already has a nice one 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.450
 the color was not so much 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.400
 I 40 fps with 330 ps and now that 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.170
 Water is really nice here 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.560
 the sun is dazzling too now waiting for the 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:37.260
 Sun yes here in the air since the rb7 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.390
 tailor that too and yes what now 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.460
 actually before the tutorial to the scaffold 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.110
 However, as I said to download 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.660
 and do not overwrite I'm just one 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:49.710
 Be careful if I am now 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.450
 decided to activate 120 1000 so 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.890
 For example we have night and 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.230
 if i do it in other cities now 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.570
 the rc 7 's also and in the 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.930
 description is looks is for example 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.400
 Sun and was called lava and yes what is 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.780
 actually here to the shader motto real 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.190
 There is nothing more to show 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.570
 if you have problems then write 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.970
 just below comment i tried 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.460
 then fix it and of course you too 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.960
 to help and yes I would say so 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.400
 then see us in the next video 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.400
 again until then
