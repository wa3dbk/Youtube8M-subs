00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
the levels do get trickier we're going

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.190 
the levels do get trickier we're going
to<00:00:45.000> go<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.120> level<00:00:45.420> two<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:45.780> now<00:00:45.809> you've<00:00:46.050> got

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.500 
to go to level two so now you've got
platforms<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.910> does<00:00:48.030> help<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.300> out<00:00:48.390> with

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
platforms and it does help you out with

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.580 
platforms and it does help you out with
the<00:00:48.600> first<00:00:48.780> couple<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.079> levels<00:00:49.170> that's<00:00:49.410> what<00:00:49.559> I

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
the first couple of levels that's what I

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.229 
the first couple of levels that's what I
really<00:00:49.890> like<00:00:50.070> about<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.460> applet<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
really like about this applet the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.910 
really like about this applet the
developers<00:00:51.809> don't<00:00:52.020> really<00:00:52.350> leave<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:52.829> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
developers don't really leave you in the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.950 
developers don't really leave you in the
blue<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.850> like<00:00:54.059> how<00:00:54.210> they<00:00:54.360> incorporated

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
blue and I like how they incorporated

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.260 
blue and I like how they incorporated
the<00:00:55.170> instructions<00:00:55.829> right<00:00:56.430> into<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.879> levels

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
the instructions right into the levels

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.770 
the instructions right into the levels
so<00:00:57.750> we're<00:00:57.870> going<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.050> go<00:00:58.140> right<00:00:58.289> into<00:00:58.469> level<00:00:58.920> 3

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
so we're going to go right into level 3

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.470 
so we're going to go right into level 3
again<00:01:00.780> there<00:01:00.930> are<00:01:01.020> 64<00:01:01.739> stages<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:03.329> one

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
again there are 64 stages and this one

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.170 
again there are 64 stages and this one
already<00:01:03.600> has<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:03.960> place<00:01:03.989> for<00:01:04.500> me<00:01:04.820> so<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.850> got

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
already has in place for me so I got

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.359 
already has in place for me so I got
lucky<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.510> note<00:01:06.720> guess<00:01:07.260> not<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:08.100> I'm<00:01:08.189> going<00:01:08.340> to

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
lucky a note guess not so I'm going to

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.149 
lucky a note guess not so I'm going to
see<00:01:08.820> if<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.000> can<00:01:09.150> move<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.619> and<00:01:10.619> move<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.950> over

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
see if I can move it and move it over

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.600 
see if I can move it and move it over
here<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:14.180> see<00:01:15.180> if<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.299> works<00:01:16.369> so<00:01:17.369> there<00:01:17.520> we

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
here and see if that works so there we

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.940 
here and see if that works so there we
go<00:01:17.640> got<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.390> into<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.840> car<00:01:19.020> crusher<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.650> really

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
go got it into the car crusher I really

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.170 
go got it into the car crusher I really
like<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.189> little<00:01:20.400> animation<00:01:20.909> where<00:01:21.030> it's

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
like the little animation where it's

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.060 
like the little animation where it's
crushed<00:01:21.390> in<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.570> car<00:01:21.810> but<00:01:22.470> we're<00:01:22.799> going<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.950> go

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
crushed in the car but we're going to go

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.380 
crushed in the car but we're going to go
back<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.490> menu<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:23.970> can<00:01:24.060> show<00:01:24.180> you

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
back to the menu so that I can show you

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.240 
back to the menu so that I can show you
that<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.750> levels<00:01:25.110> do<00:01:25.290> get<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> lot<00:01:25.890> trickier

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
that the levels do get a lot trickier

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.440 
that the levels do get a lot trickier
will<00:01:27.060> go<00:01:27.180> into<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:27.479> level<00:01:27.810> 12<00:01:28.110> here<00:01:28.610> and<00:01:29.610> now

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
will go into like level 12 here and now

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.510 
will go into like level 12 here and now
you've<00:01:30.630> got<00:01:30.840> actually<00:01:31.590> I'm<00:01:31.950> probably<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.310> fail

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
you've got actually I'm probably a fail

you've got actually I'm probably a fail
at<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.790> level<00:01:33.000> even<00:01:33.840> though<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.020> passed<00:01:34.290> it

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
at this level even though I passed it

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.810 
at this level even though I passed it
already<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.829> want<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.070> go<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.610> different

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
already I want to go to a different

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.210 
already I want to go to a different
level<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.509> don't<00:01:36.659> look<00:01:36.750> too<00:01:36.900> bad<00:01:36.930> here<00:01:37.290> level

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
level so I don't look too bad here level

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.700
