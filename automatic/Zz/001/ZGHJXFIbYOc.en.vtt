really use this hip slide so if this is

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.410 
really use this hip slide so if this is
something<00:00:55.890> you're<00:00:56.190> not<00:00:56.309> familiar<00:00:56.550> with<00:00:56.879> you

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
something you're not familiar with you

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.639 
something you're not familiar with you
might<00:00:57.600> want<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.870> drill<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.320> little<00:00:58.530> bit

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
might want to drill it a little bit

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.380 
might want to drill it a little bit
longer<00:00:58.859> because<00:00:59.160> it's<00:00:59.309> definitely<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> a

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
longer because it's definitely a a

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.510 
longer because it's definitely a a
foundation<00:01:01.020> movement<00:01:01.469> for<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.039> much<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.250> what

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
foundation movement for so much of what

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.939 
foundation movement for so much of what
we<00:01:02.640> do<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.059> looking<00:01:03.690> at<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:03.960> hip<00:01:04.140> slide<00:01:04.409> you

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
we do so looking at this hip slide you

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.620 
we do so looking at this hip slide you
want<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.189> make<00:01:05.339> sure<00:01:05.369> it's<00:01:05.670> parallel<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
want to make sure it's parallel to the

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.570 
want to make sure it's parallel to the
ground<00:01:06.810> knees<00:01:07.229> are<00:01:07.439> soft<00:01:07.710> but<00:01:08.159> they're<00:01:08.369> not

ground knees are soft but they're not

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.340 
ground knees are soft but they're not
bending<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.180> straightening<00:01:09.479> which<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.200> what

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
bending and straightening which is what

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.350 
bending and straightening which is what
allows<00:01:10.680> me<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.070> keep<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.430> movement<00:01:11.670> parallel

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
allows me to keep this movement parallel

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.300 
allows me to keep this movement parallel
to<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.659> ground<00:01:12.840> using<00:01:13.560> those<00:01:13.860> internal

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
we're going to be using both the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.600 
we're going to be using both the
obliques<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.439> knees<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.310> make<00:01:32.430> this

obliques and the knees to make this

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.039 
obliques and the knees to make this
happen<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.119> let's<00:01:33.299> just<00:01:33.479> try<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.720> on<00:01:33.960> the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
happen so let's just try this on the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.020 
happen so let's just try this on the
left<00:01:34.290> side<00:01:34.439> first<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:35.130> order<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.460> lift<00:01:35.820> your

underneath<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.950> we're<00:01:44.430> going<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.700> bend<00:01:45.119> and

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
underneath you we're going to bend and

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.940 
underneath you we're going to bend and
straighten<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.079> left<00:01:46.380> knee<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:46.770> all<00:01:46.829> I'm

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
straighten that left knee so all I'm

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.170 
straighten that left knee so all I'm
doing<00:01:47.189> here<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.340> I'm<00:01:47.430> straightening<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.060> knee

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
doing here is I'm straightening the knee

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.359 
doing here is I'm straightening the knee
and<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.780> lifts<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> left<00:01:49.530> hip<00:01:49.770> because<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
and that lifts the left hip because the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.950 
and that lifts the left hip because the
bones<00:01:50.549> are<00:01:50.729> connected<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.540> straighten<00:01:51.899> the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
bones are connected you straighten the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.270 
bones are connected you straighten the
knee<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.200> hip<00:01:52.229> goes<00:01:52.530> up<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.070> very

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
knee the hip goes up this is very

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.310 
knee the hip goes up this is very
mechanical<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.810> first<00:01:55.049> part<00:01:55.290> of

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
mechanical so this is the first part of

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.929 
mechanical so this is the first part of
what's<00:01:55.500> going<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:55.890> here<00:01:56.159> straightening<00:01:56.820> and

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939

awesome<00:02:41.630> let's<00:02:41.810> switch<00:02:41.990> side<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:42.350> side<00:02:42.530> left

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
awesome let's switch side to side left

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.790 
awesome let's switch side to side left
right<00:02:43.850> so<00:02:44.090> when<00:02:44.240> you<00:02:44.330> squeeze<00:02:44.720> one<00:02:45.200> you're

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
right so when you squeeze one you're

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.440 
right so when you squeeze one you're
releasing<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.459> other<00:02:46.610> they're<00:02:46.850> taking<00:02:47.209> turns

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
releasing the other they're taking turns

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.449 
releasing the other they're taking turns
and<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.810> hips<00:02:48.050> are<00:02:48.230> switching<00:02:48.709> which<00:02:49.250> is

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
and the hips are switching which is

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.960 
and the hips are switching which is
higher<00:02:49.670> left<00:02:50.090> right<00:02:50.959> left<00:02:51.250> right

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
higher left right left right

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.180 
higher left right left right
squeezing<00:02:53.870> keeping<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.770> hips<00:02:54.920> tucked

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
squeezing keeping the hips tucked

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.630 
squeezing keeping the hips tucked
underneath<00:02:55.550> me<00:02:55.880> shoulders<00:02:56.840> relaxed<00:02:57.500> chest<00:02:58.430> is

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
underneath me shoulders relaxed chest is

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.570 
underneath me shoulders relaxed chest is
centered<00:02:59.060> no<00:02:59.420> movement<00:02:59.810> in<00:02:59.900> the<00:02:59.990> other<00:03:00.020> body

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
centered no movement in the other body

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.550 
centered no movement in the other body
good<00:03:01.580> so<00:03:01.850> this<00:03:02.000> is<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.270> hip<00:03:02.420> lift<00:03:02.690> this<00:03:03.380> is

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
good so this is the hip lift this is

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.960 
good so this is the hip lift this is
going<00:03:03.770> to<00:03:03.830> be<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.040> second<00:03:04.370> isolation<00:03:04.940> that

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
going to be the second isolation that

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.970 
going to be the second isolation that
you<00:03:05.150> need<00:03:05.300> to<00:03:05.420> create<00:03:05.690> your<00:03:05.720> top<00:03:06.020> seam<00:03:06.290> so

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
you need to create your top seam so

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.500 
you need to create your top seam so
let's<00:03:07.160> go<00:03:07.280> ahead<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:07.640> build<00:03:07.820> this<00:03:08.030> taksim

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
let's go ahead and build this taksim

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.020 
let's go ahead and build this taksim

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
mirror that goes from down to up so

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.370 
mirror that goes from down to up so
let's<00:03:14.330> go<00:03:14.480> ahead<00:03:14.660> and<00:03:14.780> start<00:03:14.959> on<00:03:15.110> the<00:03:15.140> right

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380

so<00:04:05.569> you're<00:04:05.720> getting<00:04:05.989> this<00:04:06.160> vertical<00:04:07.160> figure

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
so you're getting this vertical figure

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.690 
so you're getting this vertical figure
eight<00:04:07.489> that<00:04:08.209> scoops<00:04:08.540> down<00:04:08.810> slide<00:04:09.709> that<00:04:09.980> scoops

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
eight that scoops down slide that scoops

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.339 
eight that scoops down slide that scoops
up<00:04:10.910> use<00:04:11.120> that<00:04:11.300> oblique<00:04:11.630> this<00:04:11.810> is<00:04:11.930> the<00:04:12.020> hardest

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
up use that oblique this is the hardest

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.670 
up use that oblique this is the hardest
part

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
part

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.800 
part
getting<00:04:12.950> that<00:04:13.130> kick<00:04:13.640> to<00:04:13.880> come<00:04:14.330> up<00:04:14.540> and<00:04:14.690> over

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
getting that kick to come up and over

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.099 
getting that kick to come up and over
the<00:04:15.709> curve<00:04:15.980> here<00:04:16.250> like<00:04:16.400> a<00:04:16.430> rollercoaster

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
the curve here like a rollercoaster

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.020 
the curve here like a rollercoaster
requires<00:04:18.109> you<00:04:18.440> to<00:04:18.470> use<00:04:18.829> your<00:04:19.010> oblique<00:04:19.430> so<00:04:19.940> you

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
requires you to use your oblique so you

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.970 
requires you to use your oblique so you
can't<00:04:20.269> depend<00:04:20.660> completely<00:04:20.810> on<00:04:21.320> your<00:04:21.620> knees<00:04:21.739> to

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
make this happen this last little bit

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.420 
make this happen this last little bit
hit<00:04:23.990> is<00:04:24.080> up<00:04:24.290> and<00:04:24.410> over<00:04:24.710> that's<00:04:24.980> completely

hit is up and over that's completely

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.030 
hit is up and over that's completely
your<00:04:25.639> oblique<00:04:25.970> squeezing<00:04:26.660> to<00:04:26.810> bring<00:04:27.020> it<00:04:27.169> over
