00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
had it probably close to three weeks and

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.139 
had it probably close to three weeks and
the<00:01:58.770> reason<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:59.130> didn't<00:01:59.340> do<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.429> review<00:01:59.789> sooner

is actually this 120 color palette this
one

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
one

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.699 
one
actually<00:04:16.850> their<00:04:17.060> third<00:04:17.329> edition<00:04:17.989> some

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
actually their third edition some

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.920 
actually their third edition some
retails<00:04:19.130> for<00:04:19.509> 3146<00:04:20.509> and<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:22.940> only<00:04:23.240> I<00:04:23.479> guess

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
retails for 3146 and the only I guess

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.140 
retails for 3146 and the only I guess
Khan<00:04:24.680> would<00:04:25.009> be<00:04:25.190> about<00:04:25.430> this<00:04:25.639> ones<00:04:25.819> that<00:04:26.060> it

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
Khan would be about this ones that it

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.240 
Khan would be about this ones that it
doesn't<00:04:26.389> come<00:04:26.539> with<00:04:26.660> the<00:04:26.690> mirror<00:04:27.050> I<00:04:27.560> think<00:04:28.190> I

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
doesn't come with the mirror I think I

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.499 
doesn't come with the mirror I think I
would<00:04:28.400> prefer<00:04:28.639> it<00:04:28.880> if<00:04:29.000> it<00:04:29.090> came<00:04:29.240> with<00:04:29.419> the

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:29.509 
would prefer it if it came with the

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:32.020 
would prefer it if it came with the
mirror<00:04:29.720> it's<00:04:29.870> just<00:04:30.080> easier<00:04:30.639> especially<00:04:31.639> when

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
mirror it's just easier especially when

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.879 
mirror it's just easier especially when
I<00:04:32.060> do<00:04:32.150> tutorials<00:04:32.539> it's<00:04:33.020> just<00:04:33.229> easier<00:04:33.590> for<00:04:33.650> me

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
I do tutorials it's just easier for me

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.100 
I do tutorials it's just easier for me
personally<00:04:34.280> to<00:04:34.789> have<00:04:34.940> a<00:04:34.970> mirror<00:04:35.360> but<00:04:35.630> it's<00:04:35.990> not

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
personally to have a mirror but it's not

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.659 
personally to have a mirror but it's not
something<00:04:36.470> that's<00:04:36.500> like<00:04:36.710> a<00:04:36.800> big<00:04:37.039> deal<00:04:37.190> to<00:04:37.250> you

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
something that's like a big deal to you

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.339 
something that's like a big deal to you
then<00:04:37.699> you<00:04:38.000> probably<00:04:38.360> wouldn't<00:04:38.750> even<00:04:38.810> care<00:04:39.169> if

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349 
then you probably wouldn't even care if

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:42.129 
then you probably wouldn't even care if
it's<00:04:39.500> there<00:04:39.729> but<00:04:40.729> me<00:04:41.120> personally<00:04:41.300> I<00:04:41.690> would

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
it's there but me personally I would

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.020 
it's there but me personally I would
prefer<00:04:42.169> to<00:04:42.470> have<00:04:42.680> a<00:04:42.710> mirror<00:04:42.949> in<00:04:43.130> there<00:04:43.310> but

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
prefer to have a mirror in there but

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.270 
prefer to have a mirror in there but

I have on today is actually out of this
palette<00:05:00.860> I<00:05:01.099> was<00:05:01.430> a<00:05:01.460> little<00:05:01.849> bit<00:05:01.970> upset<00:05:02.330> because

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949 
palette I was a little bit upset because

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.560 
palette I was a little bit upset because
when<00:05:03.949> I<00:05:03.979> opened<00:05:04.520> it<00:05:04.639> I<00:05:04.699> guess<00:05:05.000> just<00:05:05.330> from

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
when I opened it I guess just from

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.870 
when I opened it I guess just from
shipping<00:05:06.139> this<00:05:06.770> color<00:05:07.130> here<00:05:07.250> broke<00:05:09.250> but<00:05:10.250> it's

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
shipping this color here broke but it's

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.909 
shipping this color here broke but it's
not<00:05:11.090> a<00:05:11.120> big<00:05:11.330> deal<00:05:11.360> I<00:05:12.080> probably<00:05:12.500> wouldn't<00:05:12.830> use

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
not a big deal I probably wouldn't use

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:14.620 
not a big deal I probably wouldn't use
that<00:05:12.949> color<00:05:13.220> anyways<00:05:13.610> but<00:05:14.330> the<00:05:14.419> cool<00:05:14.599> thing

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
that color anyways but the cool thing

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.480 
that color anyways but the cool thing
about<00:05:14.810> this<00:05:15.080> palette<00:05:15.470> is<00:05:15.620> that<00:05:15.860> the<00:05:16.039> top<00:05:16.280> layer

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
about this palette is that the top layer

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.300 
about this palette is that the top layer
comes<00:05:16.880> off<00:05:17.090> and<00:05:17.409> then<00:05:18.409> down<00:05:19.009> at<00:05:19.190> the<00:05:19.220> bottom

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
comes off and then down at the bottom

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.399 
comes off and then down at the bottom
you<00:05:19.819> get<00:05:20.030> like<00:05:20.270> your<00:05:20.449> neutral<00:05:20.810> colors<00:05:21.169> which

beautiful<00:05:37.159> neutrals<00:05:37.639> I<00:05:37.969> feel<00:05:38.449> like<00:05:38.599> these<00:05:38.810> are

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
beautiful neutrals I feel like these are

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.080 
beautiful neutrals I feel like these are
all<00:05:39.110> different<00:05:39.409> depending<00:05:40.190> on<00:05:40.370> the<00:05:40.580> finish<00:05:40.909> of

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
all different depending on the finish of

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.760 
all different depending on the finish of
the<00:05:41.210> shadow<00:05:41.449> some<00:05:41.990> of<00:05:42.110> them<00:05:42.229> are<00:05:42.380> more

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
the shadow some of them are more

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.610 
the shadow some of them are more
pigmented<00:05:43.340> while<00:05:44.270> others<00:05:44.599> are<00:05:44.930> a<00:05:44.990> little<00:05:45.259> on<00:05:45.560> a

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
pigmented while others are a little on a

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.700 
pigmented while others are a little on a
lighter<00:05:45.949> side<00:05:46.430> so<00:05:47.300> I<00:05:47.870> guess<00:05:48.199> you<00:05:48.320> just<00:05:48.530> get

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
lighter side so I guess you just get

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.290 
lighter side so I guess you just get
your<00:05:48.800> variety<00:05:49.370> whether<00:05:49.610> you<00:05:49.880> like<00:05:50.090> your

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
your variety whether you like your

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.719 
your variety whether you like your
makeup<00:05:50.599> really<00:05:50.870> bold<00:05:51.110> or<00:05:51.469> you<00:05:52.039> know<00:05:52.159> real<00:05:52.400> soft

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:52.729 
makeup really bold or you know real soft

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:55.390 
makeup really bold or you know real soft
so<00:05:53.180> that's<00:05:54.169> the<00:05:54.349> cool<00:05:54.650> thing<00:05:54.680> about<00:05:54.919> this

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
so that's the cool thing about this

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.080 
so that's the cool thing about this
palette<00:05:55.849> here<00:05:56.409> however<00:05:57.409> if<00:05:57.710> I<00:05:57.889> had<00:05:58.070> to<00:05:58.190> pick<00:05:58.219> to

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
palette here however if I had to pick to

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.640 
palette here however if I had to pick to
go<00:05:59.349> with<00:06:00.349> this<00:06:00.710> big<00:06:00.889> one<00:06:01.130> versus<00:06:01.610> the<00:06:01.639> 15<00:06:02.360> color

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
go with this big one versus the 15 color

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.379 
go with this big one versus the 15 color
customizable<00:06:03.650> one<00:06:03.830> I<00:06:04.070> would<00:06:04.520> probably<00:06:04.820> go

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:05.389 
customizable one I would probably go

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:07.300 
customizable one I would probably go
with<00:06:05.419> this<00:06:05.719> one<00:06:05.780> so<00:06:06.289> i<00:06:06.320> definitely<00:06:06.740> recommend

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
with this one so i definitely recommend

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.339 
with this one so i definitely recommend
getting<00:06:07.789> this<00:06:08.060> one<00:06:08.270> over<00:06:08.659> the<00:06:08.810> other<00:06:08.960> one<00:06:09.139> if

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:09.349 
getting this one over the other one if

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:11.589 
getting this one over the other one if
you're<00:06:09.500> trying<00:06:09.740> to<00:06:09.919> decide<00:06:10.150> you<00:06:11.150> get<00:06:11.300> bigger

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:11.599

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:13.779 
you're trying to decide you get bigger
size<00:06:11.930> eyeshadows<00:06:12.500> I<00:06:12.770> feel<00:06:13.520> like<00:06:13.639> the

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:13.789 
size eyeshadows I feel like the

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:15.760

pigmentation<00:06:14.270> of<00:06:14.539> this<00:06:14.719> is<00:06:14.990> better<00:06:15.229> and<00:06:15.560> I

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
pigmentation of this is better and I

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.070 
pigmentation of this is better and I
feel<00:06:16.009> like<00:06:16.270> blending<00:06:17.270> wise<00:06:17.449> and<00:06:17.659> everything

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
feel like blending wise and everything

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.070 
feel like blending wise and everything
these<00:06:18.409> are<00:06:18.620> better<00:06:18.740> so<00:06:19.389> it's<00:06:20.389> totally<00:06:20.810> up<00:06:20.900> to

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080
