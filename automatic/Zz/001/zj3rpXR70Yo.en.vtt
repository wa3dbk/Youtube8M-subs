just<00:02:28.150> pick<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.870> screen<00:02:29.140> Brendan<00:02:29.799> because

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
just pick the screen Brendan because

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.430 
just pick the screen Brendan because
it's<00:02:30.700> too<00:02:31.000> much<00:02:31.150> focus<00:02:31.330> on<00:02:31.630> Iraq<00:02:31.989> because<00:02:32.110> you

make so don't leave any shot win the
game<00:02:35.170> so<00:02:35.440> that's<00:02:35.799> why<00:02:35.920> place<00:02:36.519> me<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:36.730> then<00:02:36.880> I

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
game so that's why place me and then I

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.670 
game so that's why place me and then I
