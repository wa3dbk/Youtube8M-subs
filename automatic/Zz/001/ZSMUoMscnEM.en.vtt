00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.099 
gallon three pounds of leader in the
middle<00:03:19.040> is<00:03:19.190> my<00:03:19.489> platypus<00:03:19.970> hose<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:20.480> the

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
middle is my platypus hose and the

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.440 
middle is my platypus hose and the
filter<00:03:21.500> that<00:03:21.620> I've<00:03:21.739> attached<00:03:22.069> to<00:03:22.310> it<00:03:22.430> since<00:03:23.329> I

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
filter that I've attached to it since I

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.270 
filter that I've attached to it since I
really<00:03:23.660> don't<00:03:23.900> filter<00:03:24.200> a<00:03:24.560> lot<00:03:24.799> of<00:03:24.920> my<00:03:25.040> water

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
really don't filter a lot of my water

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.490 
really don't filter a lot of my water
figured<00:03:26.090> i<00:03:26.299> would<00:03:26.450> buy<00:03:26.630> the<00:03:26.690> lightest<00:03:27.319> weight

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
figured i would buy the lightest weight

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.770 
figured i would buy the lightest weight
filter<00:03:27.859> possible<00:03:28.370> and<00:03:28.549> this<00:03:29.120> one<00:03:29.329> weighs<00:03:29.540> in

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
filter possible and this one weighs in

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.420 
filter possible and this one weighs in
at<00:03:29.870> about<00:03:29.989> two<00:03:30.410> ounces<00:03:30.560> and<00:03:30.980> it<00:03:31.130> attaches

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
at about two ounces and it attaches

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.610 
at about two ounces and it attaches
right<00:03:31.609> to<00:03:31.880> my<00:03:31.970> platypus<00:03:32.389> says<00:03:32.569> so<00:03:33.319> i'll<00:03:33.440> end<00:03:33.590> up

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
right to my platypus says so i'll end up

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.410 
right to my platypus says so i'll end up
filtering<00:03:34.099> everything<00:03:34.220> if<00:03:34.670> i<00:03:34.760> need<00:03:34.940> to<00:03:35.120> if<00:03:35.299> i'm

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
filtering everything if i need to if i'm

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.759 
filtering everything if i need to if i'm
not<00:03:35.510> just<00:03:35.720> drinking<00:03:36.049> stuff<00:03:36.200> straight<00:03:36.530> and

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
not just drinking stuff straight and

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.759 
not just drinking stuff straight and
this<00:03:37.579> will<00:03:37.760> save<00:03:38.090> me<00:03:38.150> a<00:03:38.269> bunch<00:03:38.420> of<00:03:38.540> weight

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
this will save me a bunch of weight

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.900 
this will save me a bunch of weight
hopefully<00:03:39.769> it<00:03:39.829> works<00:03:39.920> out<00:03:40.130> doesn't<00:03:40.340> clog<00:03:40.639> up<00:03:40.790> a

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
hopefully it works out doesn't clog up a

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.610 
hopefully it works out doesn't clog up a
pair<00:03:41.180> of<00:03:41.269> mixed<00:03:41.630> reviews<00:03:41.900> on<00:03:42.049> it<00:03:42.169> so<00:03:42.319> we'll<00:03:42.440> see

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
pair of mixed reviews on it so we'll see

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.789 
pair of mixed reviews on it so we'll see
i'll<00:03:42.799> let<00:03:42.859> you<00:03:43.010> know<00:03:43.099> how<00:03:43.190> that<00:03:43.310> goes<00:03:44.769> to<00:03:45.769> the

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
i'll let you know how that goes to the

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.770 
i'll let you know how that goes to the
left<00:03:46.069> of<00:03:46.190> that<00:03:46.250> we<00:03:47.209> have<00:03:47.450> my<00:03:47.989> ice<00:03:48.139> axe<00:03:49.780> never

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
left of that we have my ice axe never

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.379 
left of that we have my ice axe never
used<00:03:50.989> an<00:03:51.109> ice<00:03:51.230> axe<00:03:51.440> before<00:03:51.790> hopefully<00:03:52.790> i<00:03:53.060> don't

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
used an ice axe before hopefully i don't

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:56.199 
used an ice axe before hopefully i don't
have<00:03:53.780> to<00:03:53.930> use<00:03:54.079> it<00:03:54.109> but<00:03:54.380> if<00:03:54.799> i<00:03:54.919> do<00:03:55.209> probably

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
have to use it but if i do probably

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.699 
have to use it but if i do probably
going<00:03:56.419> to<00:03:56.480> probably<00:03:56.870> be<00:03:57.079> real<00:03:57.290> happy<00:03:57.410> that<00:03:57.680> i

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
going to probably be real happy that i

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.650 
going to probably be real happy that i
had<00:03:57.889> it<00:03:58.040> i<00:03:58.190> attached<00:03:58.819> a<00:03:59.030> red<00:03:59.180> piece<00:03:59.359> of<00:03:59.510> webbing

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
had it i attached a red piece of webbing

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.360 
had it i attached a red piece of webbing
to<00:03:59.840> it<00:04:00.079> just<00:04:00.230> so<00:04:00.380> that<00:04:00.500> I<00:04:00.560> won't<00:04:00.680> ever<00:04:00.859> drop<00:04:01.190> it

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
to it just so that I won't ever drop it

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.949 
to it just so that I won't ever drop it
or<00:04:01.489> if<00:04:01.609> I<00:04:01.700> am<00:04:01.849> on<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.090> mountain<00:04:02.329> I<00:04:02.389> do<00:04:02.599> drop<00:04:02.810> it

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
or if I am on the mountain I do drop it

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.069 
or if I am on the mountain I do drop it
and<00:04:03.049> won't<00:04:03.200> go<00:04:03.349> slide<00:04:03.799> off<00:04:03.980> the<00:04:04.099> mountain<00:04:05.079> next

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
and won't go slide off the mountain next

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.069 
and won't go slide off the mountain next
to<00:04:06.230> that<00:04:06.440> have<00:04:07.340> my<00:04:07.669> gossamer<00:04:08.209> gear<00:04:08.540> trekking

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
to that have my gossamer gear trekking

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.259 
to that have my gossamer gear trekking
poles<00:04:09.319> their<00:04:09.709> carbon<00:04:10.220> fiber<00:04:10.459> and<00:04:10.760> weigh<00:04:11.090> about

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
poles their carbon fiber and weigh about

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.170 
poles their carbon fiber and weigh about
three<00:04:11.750> ounces<00:04:11.900> of<00:04:12.139> peace<00:04:12.519> it's<00:04:13.519> much<00:04:13.880> lighter

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
three ounces of peace it's much lighter

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.819 
three ounces of peace it's much lighter
than<00:04:14.299> my<00:04:14.540> lucky<00:04:14.750> trekking<00:04:15.169> poles<00:04:15.349> I<00:04:15.440> had<00:04:15.620> that

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
than my lucky trekking poles I had that

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.680 
than my lucky trekking poles I had that
were<00:04:15.950> upwards<00:04:16.609> of<00:04:16.729> a<00:04:16.820> pound<00:04:17.030> apiece<00:04:17.180> but

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
were upwards of a pound apiece but

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.360 
were upwards of a pound apiece but
they're<00:04:18.079> ancient<00:04:18.260> although<00:04:19.130> they<00:04:19.220> do<00:04:19.280> have

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
they're ancient although they do have

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.909 
they're ancient although they do have
over<00:04:20.049> 2,500<00:04:21.049> miles<00:04:21.200> on<00:04:21.440> them<00:04:21.500> so<00:04:21.709> they<00:04:21.829> are

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
over 2,500 miles on them so they are

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.940 
over 2,500 miles on them so they are
pretty<00:04:22.099> sturdy<00:04:22.630> and<00:04:23.630> I<00:04:24.050> think<00:04:24.560> that<00:04:24.830> about

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
pretty sturdy and I think that about

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.840 
pretty sturdy and I think that about
sums<00:04:25.099> it<00:04:25.580> up<00:04:25.669> for<00:04:25.909> my<00:04:26.000> gear

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
sums it up for my gear

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.000 
sums it up for my gear
