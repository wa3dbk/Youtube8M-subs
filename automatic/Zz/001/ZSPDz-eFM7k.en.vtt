00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.950
 Apple announces something new from the analysis 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.899
 House others have already built 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.269
 Nobody cares why it is so 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.130
 Far from it should definitely be 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.059
 for example, devices as well 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.039
 asus x51 profile we now 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.260
 rightly said exactly is here again 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.760
 on it with a technical data me 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.980
 I do not know how it was to be in the lead 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.660
 usually everything is always like this 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.250
 thoroughly and write that sideways 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.830
 on it we have through a 13 200 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.309
 Full HD resolution is the whole thing 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.559
 Matt long term under 800 euros 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.940
 I think sometimes even with ssd in it 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:43.230
 46 256 gigabytes and I believe in that 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.780
 much violent fall a big 54 45 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.280
 wattstunden battery also I believe 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.460
 easy and holds eight to ten hours and 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.090
 especially three standard USB ports 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.090
 sdk 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.360
 I still believe micro hdmi out and 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.210
 the thing is our thinner than that 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.309
 macbook or macbook macbook air 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.650
 probably also dennis beck buck is 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.510
 ansich thinner than the new basin that 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.070
 all times I have the debtx lifts etc 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.200
 as well as here and I also want to mac 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.330
 per comparison, but sell apple 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.030
 the parts are not yet official 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.860
 unofficially for four to six weeks 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.840
 and for so long I am allowed to do that unfortunately 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.060
 I have rightly kept missing like that 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.490
 also creates with testing after that 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.000
 so I finally have a comparative test 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.170
 so can the packaging be in the 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.350
 Packaging is still more 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.729
 Make the packaging in order and then 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.200
 we have the beautiful zenbook 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.630
 was one of my first ultrabooks 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.060
 symbol of asus back then it's here 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.430
 continue on foot 305 and here it is 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.229
 On the outside, not on it, browsers is here 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.050
 kept in a color and was black 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:55.160
 that's the name of the whole topic 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:56.630
 or long from wacken and fast and 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.070
 then I see my many prints because 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.289
 I have the Bolshoi is unpacked 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.200
 but is loaded to play and so 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.100
 looks what then without foil 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.259
 I'm not the first one to do it 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.740
 that's why I read well 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.670
 yet or release the page output page 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.800
 Of course we will become one more 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.540
 packaging from one and hamburg and 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.920
 Although a land device is listening to her with it 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.620
 with a two-meter cable 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.670
 here's a standard end what you 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.410
 Needs to slip so here 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.120
 American end come to it 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.490
 We also do not want to do that 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.760
 always great that I did not need that 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.959
 character with 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.030
 but could also be an extra cable to 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.500
 Just plug it in if you have this double 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.360
 poland cable know otherwise attacks 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.959
 by there are five to ten euro can 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:41.189
 I also like volt in order to link 19 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:44.159
 237 ampera pier electricity issues then 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:47.030
 we have own usb3 to network adapter 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:49.079
 very nice tomorrow to measure 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.000
 and if weyers do not go neither 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.140
 Should we have a small bag then 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.909
 the acting is one more closely 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.680
 but such a cable tie has indeed 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.329
 already here a hunter has noticed 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.359
 but if he should get old 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.200
 should here always very practically everything 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:07.470
 do not forget that 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:10.379
 and two little girls with one 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.190
 sound is still if only the 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.750
 chance right 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:18.750
 but a user manual and a 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:21.030
 Warranty had for the bag for alice 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.650
 special engagement unfortunately 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.909
 not here with mine but here always 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.220
 I am completely closed to anything 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:28.409
 nice continues to hear you open the first time 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.989
 Wants to keep them relatively soft 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:33.150
 So the notebook is here with good 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:36.209
 protection if you want that 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.280
 then use a us ultrabook in the 13th 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.030
 inch area super chic little skinny 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.840
 light 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.090
 I think there are companies kilograms 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.190
 So why do not you look like us 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.720
 said extremely shallow part and is it so 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.310
 flat that your connection the barely pure 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.560
 They look exactly at each other 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.780
 once the stream usb micro hdmi 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.690
 headphones microphone in a under 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.040
 other of status leds namely the 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.090
 disk and of course a lot of power their 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.060
 have or okay 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.980
 is loaded 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.650
 in any case already on the side 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.720
 three connections than the macbook and 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.480
 Here we have another two to three 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.860
 and a sd card reader front nothing 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.290
 because forwardly a want flat 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.419
 and behind your back you also do not see anything to 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.220
 on two little gumminoppen because with 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.200
 I'm always ready for this 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.370
 lure and then you can do the whole thing 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.560
 all wonderful with already small im 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.419
 winkl use the roof and that's it 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.980
 Ultimately, unfortunately, only so far and as far as possible 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.360
 I'm a bit sorry if I am 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.130
 a bit better at my dell and 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.340
 I was not wrong we have one 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:36.190
 matte display and a beautiful 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.200
 keyboard that needs to illuminated at 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.240
 and now in the fall just as on 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.350
 German with a huge trackpad 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.479
 which of course also with several fingers 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.600
 can use for windows 8 and 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:49.270
 windows in gestures that triggers it has one 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.440
 fan though streamcore m should have 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.880
 I will be back here 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.470
 At least I see the fan tip like 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.110
 you know that from the macbooks so 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.370
 hiding and then forbid the whole 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.040
 also nice with fingerprints 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.350
 already informed here bay but there still 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.050
 The little rubber feet you go now 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.720
 Again, Apple wants trouble or her apple 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.010
 so not all looks so bad 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.410
 namely from nowadays in 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.910
 my chest but unfortunately so 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.110
 just a nice editing for it 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.520
 and the whole thing is bold 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.690
 this is already yours since a tango 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.560
 Kindergarten is it will be now 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.030
 not so nice again 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.440
 he really is completely out 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:25.510
 metal from the outside inside the part here 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.070
 even split everything and yes that 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.900
 picture just too nice but 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.360
 tried chancellor make without raich 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.700
 test with programs and play and so on 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.320
 again the smallest 13 inch notebook of the 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.460
 world because it has an extremely frame 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.560
 that could probably already be mine 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.300
 The xperia street pull with her 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.690
 infiniti display it has no screen 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.280
 have almost left each other and 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.889
 Compare the animal shortly shaved too 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.300
 already prada star systems inc usa seems 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.849
 but just as hard though 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.490
 moderately we also have more influence 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:55.259
 3 a sus because there is a usb more 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.059
 otherwise everything pretty much the same 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:59.459
 at the name displayport and at asus 

00:05:57.059 --> 00:06:00.449
 have micro hdmi port that's it 

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:02.039
 correspond already with the unboxing 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:05.550
 and chamber spectator taps that was 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:06.839
 here the asus eee x300 around 5 to 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.009
 next time and of course more soon 

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:10.009
