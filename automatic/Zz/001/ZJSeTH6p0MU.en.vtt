not<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.820> mechanic<00:00:35.969> just<00:00:36.809> explain<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.469> way

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
not a mechanic just explain this the way

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.889 
not a mechanic just explain this the way
I<00:00:37.590> understand<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.190> but<00:00:38.910> it's<00:00:39.570> gonna<00:00:39.690> give<00:00:39.840> you

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
I understand it but it's gonna give you

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.350 
I understand it but it's gonna give you
more<00:00:40.050> compression<00:00:40.590> this<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.149> going<00:00:42.300> to

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
more compression this this is going to

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.910 
more compression this this is going to
give<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.660> more<00:00:42.840> compression<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.559> more<00:00:43.710> revs

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
give you more compression and more revs

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.860 
give you more compression and more revs
it's<00:00:44.520> gonna<00:00:44.640> give<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.879> more<00:00:44.910> higher<00:00:45.510> speeds

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
it's gonna give you more higher speeds

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.830 
it's gonna give you more higher speeds
and<00:00:46.190> basically<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.579> higher<00:00:47.850> range<00:00:48.180> for<00:00:48.750> your

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
and basically a higher range for your

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.520 
and basically a higher range for your
acceleration<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:50.010> what<00:00:50.579> more<00:00:50.760> could<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.000> ask

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
acceleration so what more could you ask

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.080 
acceleration so what more could you ask
possibly<00:00:52.530> ask<00:00:52.680> for<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.100> lot<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.550> people<00:00:53.760> do<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
possibly ask for a lot of people do the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.790 
possibly ask for a lot of people do the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
very universe the clutches the gears

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.650 
very universe the clutches the gears
they<00:00:56.100> do<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.340> exhaust<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.910> say<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.360> got<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.539> do

it all and just a technical point here
the<00:01:01.590> crank<00:01:01.800> case<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.280> something<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.030> you

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
the crank case is something that you

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.670 
the crank case is something that you
should<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.539> should<00:01:03.570> eventually<00:01:04.199> get<00:01:04.559> to

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
should you should eventually get to

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.320 
should you should eventually get to
especially<00:01:04.890> on<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.189> two-strokes<00:01:05.670> because

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
especially on the two-strokes because

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.700 
especially on the two-strokes because
you<00:01:06.450> want<00:01:06.720> those<00:01:06.930> reps<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.320> want<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.590> have

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
you want those reps you want to have

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.500 
you want those reps you want to have
more<00:01:08.220> performance<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:08.880> one<00:01:09.030> right<00:01:09.180> here<00:01:09.330> is

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.240 
pedal Fedderson tag material on them
they<00:01:50.100> give<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.610> better<00:01:51.479> circle<00:01:52.250> and

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
they give you a better circle and

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.560 
they give you a better circle and
basically<00:01:53.700> again<00:01:54.060> they're<00:01:54.240> gonna<00:01:54.299> give<00:01:54.479> you

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
basically again they're gonna give you

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.810 
basically again they're gonna give you
more<00:01:54.780> revs<00:01:55.409> higher<00:01:55.920> speeds<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.610> you're<00:01:56.729> gonna

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
more revs higher speeds and you're gonna

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.719 
more revs higher speeds and you're gonna
get<00:01:56.939> more<00:01:57.149> quality<00:01:57.360> performance<00:01:58.020> out<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.170> it

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
get more quality performance out of it

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.249 
get more quality performance out of it
now<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.790> technical<00:02:00.299> means<00:02:00.840> for<00:02:01.140> this

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
now the technical means for this

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.560 
now the technical means for this
basically<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.399> you're<00:02:02.610> gonna<00:02:02.700> get<00:02:02.939> an

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
basically is that you're gonna get an

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.270 
basically is that you're gonna get an
why<00:02:03.869> you're<00:02:04.049> gonna<00:02:04.140> get<00:02:04.259> higher<00:02:04.469> speeds<00:02:04.799> is

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
why you're gonna get higher speeds is

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.630 
why you're gonna get higher speeds is
that<00:02:06.180> they're<00:02:06.600> basically<00:02:06.990> built<00:02:07.320> better<00:02:07.640> it's

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
that they're basically built better it's

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.930 
that they're basically built better it's
a<00:02:08.789> better<00:02:09.569> quality<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.140> material<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:11.430> rod<00:02:11.640> is

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
a better quality of material the rod is

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.820 
a better quality of material the rod is
a<00:02:12.480> better<00:02:12.690> quality

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
a better quality

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.770 
a better quality
and<00:02:13.920> it's<00:02:14.430> gonna<00:02:14.550> give<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.850> that<00:02:15.060> higher<00:02:15.270> rpm

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
and it's gonna give you that higher rpm

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.140 
and it's gonna give you that higher rpm
range<00:02:15.930> that<00:02:16.080> you're<00:02:16.200> looking<00:02:16.470> for<00:02:16.880> now<00:02:17.880> don't

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
range that you're looking for now don't

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.000 
range that you're looking for now don't
forget<00:02:18.240> you<00:02:18.510> should<00:02:18.720> change<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.500> bearings

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
forget you should change the bearings

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.730 
forget you should change the bearings

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
the oil seals and gaskets and make sure

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.080 
the oil seals and gaskets and make sure
that<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:22.950> change<00:02:23.130> these<00:02:23.340> things<00:02:23.400> when<00:02:23.700> you're

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
that you change these things when you're

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.450 
that you change these things when you're
upgrading<00:02:24.900> on<00:02:25.320> your<00:02:25.440> scooter<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:26.160> don't<00:02:26.340> want

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
upgrading on your scooter you don't want

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.830 
upgrading on your scooter you don't want
to<00:02:26.550> change<00:02:26.820> one<00:02:27.090> thing<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.450> change<00:02:27.720> the

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
to change one thing and that change the

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.050 
to change one thing and that change the
other<00:02:28.130> so<00:02:29.130> when<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.400> replace<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.790> crankcase

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
other so when you replace the crankcase

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.570 
other so when you replace the crankcase
make<00:02:30.390> sure<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.600> change<00:02:30.780> those<00:02:30.990> other<00:02:31.140> items

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
make sure to change those other items

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.120 
make sure to change those other items
it<00:02:33.090> could<00:02:33.330> be<00:02:33.540> handy<00:02:33.900> sometimes<00:02:34.860> we<00:02:35.040> will

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
it could be handy sometimes we will

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.620 
it could be handy sometimes we will
break<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.430> gasket<00:02:35.850> through<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.090> seals<00:02:36.330> or

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
break the gasket through the seals or

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.360 
break the gasket through the seals or
they<00:02:36.720> forget<00:02:36.960> to<00:02:37.080> replace<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.500> oil<00:02:37.650> seals<00:02:37.920> and

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
they forget to replace the oil seals and

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.740 
they forget to replace the oil seals and
that<00:02:38.490> could<00:02:38.610> be<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.730> problem

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
that could be a problem

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.650 
that could be a problem
are<00:02:40.020> there<00:02:40.350> some<00:02:41.010> crank<00:02:41.310> shafts<00:02:41.550> there<00:02:41.760> are<00:02:42.000> a

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
are there some crank shafts there are a

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.040 
are there some crank shafts there are a
little<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.440> few<00:02:43.620> more<00:02:43.860> millimeters<00:02:44.490> yes<00:02:45.050> and

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
little a few more millimeters yes and

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.960 
little a few more millimeters yes and
they<00:02:46.380> can<00:02:46.620> give<00:02:46.800> you<00:02:46.830> some<00:02:46.920> higher<00:02:47.250> rpm<00:02:47.670> ranges

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
they can give you some higher rpm ranges

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.540 
they can give you some higher rpm ranges
we<00:02:48.720> do<00:02:48.870> sell<00:02:49.140> those<00:02:49.290> for<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.560> gy6<00:02:49.920> series<00:02:50.370> but

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
we do sell those for the gy6 series but

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.830 
we do sell those for the gy6 series but
for<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.760> two<00:02:50.910> strokes<00:02:51.150> which<00:02:51.330> are<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.510> ones<00:02:51.690> I

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
for the two strokes which are the ones I

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.210 
for the two strokes which are the ones I
got<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.050> email<00:02:52.290> about<00:02:52.320> and<00:02:52.680> then<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:53.040> quite

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
got the email about and then the quite

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.390 
got the email about and then the quite
the<00:02:53.250> ones<00:02:53.490> I'm<00:02:53.610> showing<00:02:53.640> right<00:02:53.940> here<00:02:55.160> you<00:02:56.160> want

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
the ones I'm showing right here you want

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.370 
the ones I'm showing right here you want
to<00:02:56.490> change<00:02:56.700> that<00:02:56.880> Berrio<00:02:57.390> ratio<00:02:57.840> inside<00:02:58.260> the

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
to change that Berrio ratio inside the

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.930 
to change that Berrio ratio inside the
transmission<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:59.100> get<00:02:59.340> one<00:02:59.460> of<00:02:59.550> these<00:02:59.640> full

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
transmission and get one of these full

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.850 
transmission and get one of these full
performance<00:03:00.150> ones<00:03:00.630> again<00:03:01.320> that's<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.710> what

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
performance ones again that's the what

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.080 
performance ones again that's the what
that's<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.340> reason<00:03:02.550> you<00:03:02.640> get<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.910> higher

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
that's the reason you get the higher

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.090 
that's the reason you get the higher
speed<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:03.690> you<00:03:04.080> get<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.440> more<00:03:04.620> compression

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
speed and you get the more compression

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.780 
speed and you get the more compression
because<00:03:05.520> it<00:03:05.820> has<00:03:05.940> a<00:03:05.970> higher<00:03:06.450> ratio<00:03:07.670> so<00:03:08.670> it's

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
because it has a higher ratio so it's

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.250 
because it has a higher ratio so it's
going<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:09.000> have<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.150> bigger<00:03:09.630> movement<00:03:09.870> inside

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
going to have a bigger movement inside

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.420 
going to have a bigger movement inside
and<00:03:10.560> you're<00:03:10.680> gonna<00:03:10.770> get<00:03:10.920> that<00:03:11.010> increased

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
and you're gonna get that increased

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.120 
and you're gonna get that increased
performance<00:03:11.610> and<00:03:12.860> you<00:03:13.860> know<00:03:13.950> that's

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
performance and you know that's

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.560 
performance and you know that's
basically<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.730> gist<00:03:14.880> of<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.420> way<00:03:15.540> I

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
basically the gist of it the way I

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.450 
basically the gist of it the way I
understand<00:03:16.200> it<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:16.800> we<00:03:16.980> do<00:03:17.130> have<00:03:17.280> several

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
understand it and we do have several

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.040 
understand it and we do have several
brands<00:03:17.910> do<00:03:18.060> I<00:03:18.120> prefer<00:03:18.360> one<00:03:18.690> over<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.959> other

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
brands do I prefer one over the other

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.080 
brands do I prefer one over the other
