00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.830 
with i don't actually have a zipper with
me<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:32.880> i'm<00:01:32.939> just<00:01:32.970> going<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.270> leave<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.420> open

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
me so i'm just going to leave it open

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.480 
me so i'm just going to leave it open
but<00:01:33.960> which<00:01:34.110> we<00:01:34.259> normally<00:01:34.409> do<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.950> connect<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
but which we normally do is connect the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.870 
but which we normally do is connect the
outermost<00:01:36.420> layer<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.680> then<00:01:38.520> kind<00:01:38.759> of

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
outermost layer of that and then kind of

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.999 
outermost layer of that and then kind of
allow<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.450> be<00:01:39.720> all<00:01:40.049> sealed<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.799> kind<00:01:40.979> of

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
allow that to be all sealed and kind of

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.260 
allow that to be all sealed and kind of
attached<00:01:41.369> i'll<00:01:41.549> probably<00:01:41.700> something<00:01:42.090> like<00:01:42.119> a

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
attached i'll probably something like a

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.270 
attached i'll probably something like a
zipper<00:01:42.570> would<00:01:42.720> be<00:01:42.840> ideal<00:01:43.020> for<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.619> or<00:01:44.130> maybe

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
zipper would be ideal for that or maybe

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.590 
zipper would be ideal for that or maybe
just<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.579> little<00:01:44.700> bit<00:01:44.820> about<00:01:45.030> go<00:01:45.299> all<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.570> way

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
just a little bit about go all the way

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.660 
just a little bit about go all the way
around<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.829> i'm<00:01:46.920> going<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.189> do<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.369> work<00:01:47.549> on

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
around it so i'm going to do is work on

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.039 
around it so i'm going to do is work on
the<00:01:47.790> flower<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.240> goes<00:01:48.390> on<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.630> top<00:01:48.689> i'm

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
the flower that goes on the top i'm

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.870 
the flower that goes on the top i'm
still<00:01:49.409> only<00:01:49.590> limited<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.070> black<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.759> yellow

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
still only limited to black and yellow

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.190 
still only limited to black and yellow
so<00:01:51.210> i'll<00:01:51.270> be<00:01:51.390> kind<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.630> alternating<00:01:52.049> with

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
so i'll be kind of alternating with

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.410 
so i'll be kind of alternating with
those<00:01:52.350> colors<00:01:52.799> i'm<00:01:53.520> going<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.790> work<00:01:53.970> on<00:01:54.180> you

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
those colors i'm going to work on you

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.249 
those colors i'm going to work on you
know<00:01:54.479> just<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.750> little<00:01:54.960> bit<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.170> the

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
know just a little bit of the

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.080 
know just a little bit of the
traditional<00:01:55.740> flower<00:01:56.009> petals<00:01:56.430> first<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.000> then

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
traditional flower petals first and then

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.330 
traditional flower petals first and then
i'm<00:01:57.180> going<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.450> switch<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.469> rounded

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
i'm going to switch to the rounded

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.700 
i'm going to switch to the rounded
petals<00:01:59.729> as<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.030> can<00:02:00.210> see<00:02:00.479> here<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.469> kind<00:02:01.649> of

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
petals as you can see here so kind of

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.530 
petals as you can see here so kind of
just<00:02:01.829> folding<00:02:02.130> those<00:02:02.250> around<00:02:02.610> there's

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
just folding those around there's

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.999 
just folding those around there's
definitely<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.899> lot<00:02:03.990> easier<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.439> make<00:02:04.619> them<00:02:04.829> be

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
definitely a lot easier to make them be

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.039 
definitely a lot easier to make them be
traditional<00:02:05.640> kind<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.000> pyramid<00:02:06.780> shaped

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
traditional kind of pyramid shaped

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.219 
traditional kind of pyramid shaped
flower<00:02:07.560> petals<00:02:07.950> which<00:02:08.160> i<00:02:08.340> started<00:02:08.729> off<00:02:08.849> with

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
flower petals which i started off with

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.809 
flower petals which i started off with
kind<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.530> just<00:02:10.590> use<00:02:10.830> those<00:02:11.069> as<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.280> but<00:02:11.580> in<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
kind of just use those as the but in the

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.949 
kind of just use those as the but in the
center<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.209> then<00:02:12.330> I'm<00:02:12.480> going<00:02:12.599> to<00:02:12.629> be<00:02:12.750> using

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
center and then I'm going to be using

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.860 
center and then I'm going to be using
these<00:02:13.310> flower<00:02:14.310> petals<00:02:14.760> these<00:02:15.330> rounded<00:02:15.750> ones

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
these flower petals these rounded ones

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.270 
these flower petals these rounded ones
to<00:02:16.110> kind<00:02:16.349> of<00:02:16.409> just<00:02:16.590> add<00:02:16.769> a<00:02:16.799> little<00:02:17.040> bit<00:02:17.220> of

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
to kind of just add a little bit of

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.449 
to kind of just add a little bit of
style<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:17.909> color<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.709> so<00:02:19.709> sticking<00:02:20.159> those

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
style and color to it so sticking those

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.850 
style and color to it so sticking those
around<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.909> side<00:02:21.150> here<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.690> I've<00:02:22.530> used<00:02:22.739> these

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
around the side here and I've used these

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.289 
around the side here and I've used these
in<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.069> few<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.400> my<00:02:23.489> other<00:02:23.610> videos<00:02:23.700> in<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.120> past

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
in a few of my other videos in the past

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.900 
in a few of my other videos in the past
but<00:02:24.540> usually<00:02:25.019> do<00:02:25.170> is<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.349> hold<00:02:25.860> them<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.370> put<00:02:26.640> put

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
but usually do is I hold them I put put

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.430 
but usually do is I hold them I put put
them<00:02:27.060> all<00:02:27.209> on<00:02:27.480> kind<00:02:27.959> of<00:02:28.019> like<00:02:28.140> straight<00:02:28.410> up

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440

fashion and then I kind of I kind of

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.699 
fashion and then I kind of I kind of
wrapped<00:02:33.299> them<00:02:33.480> all<00:02:33.629> down<00:02:33.930> at<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.230> very<00:02:34.260> end

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
wrapped them all down at the very end

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.550 
wrapped them all down at the very end
kind<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.099> just<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.790> know<00:02:36.140> make<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.290> flower

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
in the spots in between just alternating

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.319 
in the spots in between just alternating
back<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:50.280> forth<00:02:50.640> between<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.090> black<00:02:51.299> and

back and forth between the black and

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.869 
back and forth between the black and
yellow<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:51.989> that's<00:02:52.260> kind<00:02:52.530> of<00:02:52.560> simple<00:02:53.010> things

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
yellow and that's kind of simple things

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.089 
yellow and that's kind of simple things
a<00:02:54.030> pretty<00:02:54.299> simple<00:02:54.540> pattern<00:02:54.989> here<00:02:55.290> so<00:02:55.859> skip

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
a pretty simple pattern here so skip

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.589 
a pretty simple pattern here so skip
ahead<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.370> little<00:02:56.459> bit<00:02:56.730> here<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:57.269> have<00:02:57.420> my

like<00:03:02.129> I<00:03:02.250> said<00:03:02.310> make<00:03:02.910> it<00:03:03.060> look<00:03:03.180> really<00:03:03.480> cool<00:03:03.890> go

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
like I said make it look really cool go

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.069 
like I said make it look really cool go
a<00:03:04.920> little<00:03:05.129> bit<00:03:05.310> of<00:03:05.459> flour<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:06.030> then<00:03:06.810> I'm<00:03:06.959> going

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
a little bit of flour and then I'm going

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.330 
a little bit of flour and then I'm going
to<00:03:07.109> stick<00:03:07.230> that<00:03:07.410> right<00:03:07.470> on<00:03:07.799> top<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.190> now<00:03:08.280> the

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
to stick that right on top and now the

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.800 
to stick that right on top and now the
stem<00:03:08.609> is<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.790> little<00:03:09.030> bit<00:03:09.120> too<00:03:09.299> long<00:03:09.480> so<00:03:09.750> I

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
stem is a little bit too long so I

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.289 
stem is a little bit too long so I
decided<00:03:10.140> to<00:03:10.260> use<00:03:10.379> the<00:03:10.730> pair<00:03:11.730> of<00:03:11.819> scissors<00:03:12.180> i

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
decided to use the pair of scissors i

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.059 
decided to use the pair of scissors i
actually<00:03:12.569> just<00:03:12.599> cut<00:03:12.870> myself<00:03:13.049> with<00:03:13.349> Paris's

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.500 
going to show you exactly where the
zipper<00:03:23.040> would<00:03:23.310> be<00:03:23.489> kind<00:03:24.090> of<00:03:24.120> all<00:03:24.299> the<00:03:24.419> way

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
zipper would be kind of all the way

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.659 
zipper would be kind of all the way
around<00:03:24.599> that<00:03:24.930> clamshell<00:03:25.560> part<00:03:25.919> and<00:03:26.250> i<00:03:26.519> would

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
around that clamshell part and i would

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.940 
around that clamshell part and i would
