dressed like this you can just put that
one<00:01:32.310> little<00:01:32.700> entity<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.299> blocks<00:01:33.689> into<00:01:34.380> your

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
one little entity of blocks into your

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.230 
one little entity of blocks into your
chest<00:01:35.100> like<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.729> chest<00:01:36.060> can

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
chest like this and this chest can

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.480 
chest like this and this chest can
literally<00:01:36.659> take<00:01:36.900> 2.1<00:01:37.500> billion<00:01:37.740> items<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.310> this

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
literally take 2.1 billion items so this

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.270 
literally take 2.1 billion items so this
can<00:01:38.670> hold<00:01:38.850> really<00:01:39.180> any<00:01:39.390> amount<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.619> items<00:01:41.130> that

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
you want it to as long as you have the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.420 
you want it to as long as you have the
amount<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:42.990> lapis<00:01:43.259> necessary<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.040> get<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.280> in

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
amount of lapis necessary to get it in

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.130 
amount of lapis necessary to get it in
there<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:45.180> goes<00:01:45.329> quite<00:01:45.570> fast<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:46.020> there

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
there and it goes quite fast in there

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.749 
there and it goes quite fast in there
it's<00:01:46.259> like<00:01:46.350> an<00:01:46.470> item<00:01:46.649> every<00:01:47.040> two<00:01:47.250> seconds<00:01:47.640> or

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
it's like an item every two seconds or

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.490 
it's like an item every two seconds or
something<00:01:48.000> like<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.149> but<00:01:48.930> you're<00:01:49.320> also

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
something like that but you're also

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.050 
something like that but you're also
probably<00:01:49.770> wondering<00:01:50.250> how<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.460> get<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.790> items

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
probably wondering how to get the items

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.460 
probably wondering how to get the items
out<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.450> that's<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.630> very<00:01:51.840> good<00:01:52.049> question

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
out and that's a very good question

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.230 
out and that's a very good question
and<00:01:52.649> all<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.340> have<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.490> do<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.729> just<00:01:53.939> get<00:01:54.060> some

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
and all you have to do is just get some

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.870 
and all you have to do is just get some
lapis<00:01:54.450> as<00:01:54.750> well<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.590> pull<00:01:55.829> out<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.100> lapis<00:01:56.399> and

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
lapis as well so pull out that lapis and

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.100 
lapis as well so pull out that lapis and
then<00:01:57.180> what<00:01:57.270> you're<00:01:57.360> gonna<00:01:57.450> want<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.780> do<00:01:57.930> is

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
then what you're gonna want to do is

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.480 
then what you're gonna want to do is
bring<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.439> down<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.860> slot<00:01:59.189> right<00:01:59.430> here

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
bring it down to this slot right here

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.280 
bring it down to this slot right here
and<00:01:59.820> when<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.390> put<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.960> that's<00:02:01.079> going

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
and when you put that and that's going

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.020 
and when you put that and that's going
to<00:02:01.350> kind<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.590> fire<00:02:01.799> up<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.070> burners<00:02:02.460> down<00:02:02.640> here

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
to kind of fire up the burners down here

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.030 
to kind of fire up the burners down here
which<00:02:03.420> will<00:02:03.600> then<00:02:03.750> start<00:02:04.409> bringing<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.799> items

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
which will then start bringing the items

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.679 
which will then start bringing the items
out<00:02:05.219> so<00:02:05.430> obviously<00:02:05.549> you're<00:02:06.240> probably<00:02:06.450> gonna

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
out so obviously you're probably gonna

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.449 
out so obviously you're probably gonna
want<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:06.990> have<00:02:07.110> both<00:02:07.320> processes<00:02:08.009> go<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.280> at<00:02:08.369> the

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
want to have both processes go in at the

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.589 
want to have both processes go in at the
same<00:02:08.489> time<00:02:08.670> because<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.179> would<00:02:09.300> just<00:02:09.330> be

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
same time because that would just be

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.300 
same time because that would just be
useless<00:02:09.929> so<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.590> would<00:02:10.770> take<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.069> out<00:02:11.250> and

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
useless so I would take this out and

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.280 
useless so I would take this out and
that<00:02:11.819> would<00:02:12.030> uh<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.569> know<00:02:12.690> stop<00:02:12.989> everything

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
that would uh you know stop everything

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.940 
that would uh you know stop everything
from<00:02:13.410> coming<00:02:13.770> out

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
from coming out

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.190 
from coming out
then<00:02:14.069> you<00:02:14.190> guys<00:02:14.310> can<00:02:14.370> store<00:02:14.760> as<00:02:14.940> many<00:02:15.510> items<00:02:15.810> in

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
then you guys can store as many items in

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.660 
then you guys can store as many items in
the<00:02:16.349> chest<00:02:16.590> as<00:02:16.709> you<00:02:16.830> want<00:02:17.069> it's<00:02:17.220> just<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.489> matter

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
the chest as you want it's just a matter

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.210 
the chest as you want it's just a matter
of<00:02:17.790> time<00:02:18.150> as<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.870> how<00:02:18.989> many<00:02:19.050> items<00:02:19.769> you<00:02:20.010> can<00:02:20.129> get

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
of time as to how many items you can get

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.680 
of time as to how many items you can get
in<00:02:20.340> there<00:02:20.489> obviously<00:02:20.940> does<00:02:21.209> take<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.450> little

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
in there obviously does take a little

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.509 
in there obviously does take a little
bit<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:22.410> us<00:02:22.560> store<00:02:22.830> your<00:02:23.010> items<00:02:23.280> in<00:02:23.370> there<00:02:23.489> I
