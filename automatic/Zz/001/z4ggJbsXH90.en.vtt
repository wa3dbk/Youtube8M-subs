00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:54.630 
with all these ships it shouldn't take

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.390 
with all these ships it shouldn't take
long<00:07:54.810> especially<00:07:55.320> with<00:07:55.560> flak<00:07:55.800> frigates<00:07:56.190> take

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 
long especially with flak frigates take

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.550 
long especially with flak frigates take
these<00:07:56.580> out<00:07:56.790> it<00:07:57.480> won't<00:07:57.720> take<00:07:57.810> long<00:07:57.930> time<00:07:58.290> to<00:07:58.350> be

00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 
these out it won't take long time to be

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:10.110 
these out it won't take long time to be
destroyed

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:10.120 

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.990
