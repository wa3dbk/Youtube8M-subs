00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.070
 you 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.099
 not 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.260
 we all know the importance of rural property fences 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.630
 they are used in the currencies of the property and also to divide 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.570
 spaces in smaller areas that make possible the greater use of the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.210
 Grazing Leading Palm Increases Property Efficiency and Profitability 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.490
 this technology has been used for a long time in other countries where the 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.240
 field use is more intensive 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.640
 a fence and conventional pioneerism the papacy 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.140
 it may seem like a cheap simple structure and makes it to be built 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.570
 however we only see that the construction of a fence of this type is laborious 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.500
 Angry 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.670
 dry, for example, meets all the necessary characteristics of 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.740
 strength and durability 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.740
 and this one so simple with only one child 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.070
 although it has this aspect of secrecy seem to respect the animals 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.340
 who are afraid to approach her 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.270
 what will be the impact that a simple wire of wire supported by cuttings so 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.270
 cause these animals 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.160
 we are talking about electric fence 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.840
 an excellent option for delimiting production areas 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.310
 farming 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.770
 for this reason associated with the fact that they are very simple tired structures 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.860
 easy to build and low cost 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.360
 the use of electric fences in Brazil has been growing very 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.989
 as in other countries 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.599
 so cpt prepared this video course to take you to the 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.040
 information regarding the use of electric fence in the 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.040
 Rural property 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.949
 the purpose of these 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:28.769
 is to update the information regarding 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.419
 the installation of electric fence shackles 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:34.649
 mainly for rotary grazing 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:38.799
 correct application of the fundamentals explained in this video course 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.199
 will bring direct benefits to the producer who wants to install 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:49.370
 layoffs from grazing dairy cattle to by e-mail listening to them is with 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.949
 Indians I 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:53.539
 based on electrified fences 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:56.539
 modems are surrounded or permanent ones 

00:02:57.529 --> 00:03:00.299
 through subdivisions of the area 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.449
 it is possible to achieve a better management of the extensive forage resources 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:05.589
 property 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:10.469
 which will surely bring about the increase in the production of her milk meat 

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:13.689
 it is therefore our desire 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:16.759
 and all the information presented here 

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:20.430
 good for the evolution of local products and their properties 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.649
 exist 

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:28.539
 believe
