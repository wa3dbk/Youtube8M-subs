harmonious with her facial features what
do<00:00:09.120> I<00:00:09.179> mean<00:00:09.360> by<00:00:09.389> that<00:00:09.660> we<00:00:09.960> use<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.110> golden

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
do I mean by that we use a golden

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.870 
do I mean by that we use a golden
proportion<00:00:11.160> measurement<00:00:11.670> that<00:00:11.730> was

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
proportion measurement that was

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.539 
proportion measurement that was
discovered<00:00:12.389> by<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.540> Greeks<00:00:12.900> more<00:00:13.200> than<00:00:13.549> 2,000

years ago

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.810 
years ago
I<00:00:15.179> mean<00:00:15.389> imagine<00:00:15.570> at<00:00:15.870> 2,000<00:00:16.650> years<00:00:16.800> ago<00:00:16.949> these

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
I mean imagine at 2,000 years ago these

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.970 
I mean imagine at 2,000 years ago these
very<00:00:18.750> learned<00:00:19.020> people<00:00:19.230> figured<00:00:19.710> out<00:00:19.800> that

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
very learned people figured out that

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.220 
very learned people figured out that
their<00:00:20.130> mathematical<00:00:20.820> formulas<00:00:21.330> in<00:00:21.539> biology

their mathematical formulas in biology

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.650 
their mathematical formulas in biology
and<00:00:22.439> there<00:00:23.160> actually<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.789> gauge<00:00:24.060> called<00:00:24.510> the

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
and there actually is a gauge called the

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.759 
and there actually is a gauge called the
golden<00:00:25.019> proportion<00:00:25.170> gauge<00:00:25.740> which<00:00:26.490> measures<00:00:27.060> a

distance between this point and this
point<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.540> one<00:00:37.140> then<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.370> value<00:00:38.760> from<00:00:38.940> this

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120

eight and what's really interesting is

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.310 
eight and what's really interesting is
that<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.809> works<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.430> the<00:00:53.430> anatomy<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.850> T

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
that it works in the anatomy of T

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.229 
that it works in the anatomy of T
beautiful<00:00:55.320> teeth<00:00:55.559> are<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:56.160> golden<00:00:56.670> proportion

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
beautiful teeth are in golden proportion

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.360 
beautiful teeth are in golden proportion
when<00:00:57.570> your<00:00:57.719> atom<00:00:57.989> golden<00:00:58.260> proportion<00:00:58.859> they

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
when your atom golden proportion they

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.250 
when your atom golden proportion they
just<00:00:59.640> don't<00:00:59.879> look<00:01:00.090> right<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.870> person's

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
just don't look right on that person's

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.560 
just don't look right on that person's
face<00:01:01.469> let<00:01:02.100> me<00:01:02.190> show<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.399> an<00:01:02.520> example<00:01:02.579> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
face let me show you an example the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.950 
face let me show you an example the
width<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:04.080> lateral<00:01:04.530> incisor<00:01:05.750> versus<00:01:06.750> a

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
width of a lateral incisor versus a

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.160 
width of a lateral incisor versus a
central<00:01:07.350> incisor<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.220> approximately<00:01:09.170> 1/2

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
central incisor it is approximately 1/2

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.100 
central incisor it is approximately 1/2
1.618

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
1.618

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.090 
1.618
now<00:01:13.110> there<00:01:13.320> are<00:01:13.409> other<00:01:13.530> proportions

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
now there are other proportions

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.249 
now there are other proportions
throughout<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.580> body<00:01:14.760> if<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.869> look<00:01:16.020> at<00:01:16.140> this

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
throughout the body if you look at this

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.230 
throughout the body if you look at this
mouth<00:01:16.560> here<00:01:16.920> we<00:01:17.280> have<00:01:17.430> some<00:01:17.610> irregular<00:01:18.060> edges

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
mouth here we have some irregular edges

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.810 
mouth here we have some irregular edges
which<00:01:18.570> organization<00:01:19.229> reshape<00:01:19.650> today<00:01:19.950> but

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
which organization reshape today but

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.370 
which organization reshape today but
also<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.210> teeth<00:01:21.390> are<00:01:21.570> too<00:01:21.780> long<00:01:22.020> in

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
also the teeth are too long in

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.960 
also the teeth are too long in
relationship<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.220> size<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.790> mouth

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
relationship to the size of the mouth

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.999 
relationship to the size of the mouth
and<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.450> base<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.930> nose<00:01:25.080> if<00:01:25.470> we<00:01:25.619> take<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
and the base of the nose if we take the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.749 
and the base of the nose if we take the
measurement<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:27.299> base<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.780> nose

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
measurement of the base of the nose

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.219 
measurement of the base of the nose
through<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.909> base<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.450> lips<00:01:30.659> when<00:01:31.049> a

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
through the base of the lips when a

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.929 
through the base of the lips when a
person<00:01:31.680> smiles<00:01:32.509> the<00:01:33.509> tooth<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:35.130> tooth<00:01:35.159> length

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
person smiles the tooth the tooth length

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.429 
person smiles the tooth the tooth length
should<00:01:36.780> be<00:01:36.840> approximately<00:01:37.439> right<00:01:38.100> here

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.099 

so<00:01:41.039> if<00:01:41.100> we<00:01:41.219> shorten<00:01:41.520> up<00:01:41.729> these<00:01:41.880> teeth<00:01:42.210> just<00:01:42.990> a

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:43.109 
so if we shorten up these teeth just a

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:45.349 
so if we shorten up these teeth just a
little<00:01:43.409> bit<00:01:43.560> more<00:01:43.829> they<00:01:44.819> will<00:01:44.999> look<00:01:45.179> more

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:45.359 
little bit more they will look more

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:47.840 
little bit more they will look more
imbalanced<00:01:45.689> with<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.109> smile<00:01:46.439> she<00:01:47.009> has<00:01:47.039> several
