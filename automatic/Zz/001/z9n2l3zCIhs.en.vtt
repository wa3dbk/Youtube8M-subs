use we've got some wool and instead of

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.210 
use we've got some wool and instead of
using<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.989> dye<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.200> think<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:13.739> do<00:02:13.920> this<00:02:14.069> I

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
using a dye I think you do this I

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.280 
using a dye I think you do this I
haven't<00:02:14.430> really<00:02:14.610> tested<00:02:14.819> it<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.150> lot<00:02:15.360> so<00:02:15.629> so<00:02:16.200> if

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
haven't really tested it a lot so so if

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.229 
haven't really tested it a lot so so if
you<00:02:16.379> want<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.560> make<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:16.739> black<00:02:17.069> banner<00:02:17.879> you<00:02:18.060> just

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
you want to make a black banner you just

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.809 
you want to make a black banner you just
go<00:02:18.330> like<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.599> to<00:02:18.930> fill<00:02:19.140> them<00:02:19.290> all<00:02:19.409> up<00:02:19.730> so<00:02:20.730> you

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
go like that to fill them all up so you

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.369 
go like that to fill them all up so you
need<00:02:20.940> six<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.299> them<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.629> you<00:02:21.989> get<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.140> black

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
need six of them and you get a black

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.960 
need six of them and you get a black
banner<00:02:22.590> so<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:22.890> don't<00:02:23.129> believe<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.489> if<00:02:23.879> you

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
different color will you use the

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.449 
different color will you use the
different<00:02:27.959> color<00:02:28.260> banner<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.709> get<00:02:28.920> okay<00:02:29.159> so
