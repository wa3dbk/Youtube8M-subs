00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:10.430
 when I was thinking about your career you maybe 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.379
 You are one of the few privileges that 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.020
 I can really talk about all the 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.970
 football and sports facets of 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.730
 messi because you saw him from different 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.760
 points of view what is messi level 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.870
 barcelona level and global level 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.640
 Argentine team when it arrived at the 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:31.189
 espanyol of barcelona 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.940
 we are going to eat an Argentinean appearance and 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.239
 a friend 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.420
 well we became friends and if 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.010
 there is not a boy who is playing here in 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.010
 my barcelona period is argentina in 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.930
 rosario a man arrives and knows him by 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.739
 first time I saw him debut because he 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.540
 debuted there and well one followed a little bit the 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.210
 evolution of him because he was in the 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.059
 same links the truth as it came 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.629
 doing but now that one never 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:04.049
 imagine that you can do what it is today 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.700
 because today you can say good diego to 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.960
 I better say also at that moment when 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.149
 he was young no one imagines he can 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.819
 be what they are because they are players who 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:17.280
 for me they are not normal to say it of 

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:19.409
 somehow that's what the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.929
 training 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.850
 for some of you they tell you that this is 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:27.960
 a crack that I'm different than that is a 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:31.429
 idol that's a reference you 're not 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.950
 speaking in the same way is 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:36.860
 steps up what 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.100
 that all of us do but you like 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.890
 colleagues if luckily I have it of my 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.840
 side to this tranquility when I was 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.909
 in the attic 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.490
 I remember that that part does not have a 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.750
 era with the athletic made all 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.439
 the parties with already said others of 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.979
 veracity 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.600
 we did not have and now we win or 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.579
 we ate a terrible dance that was 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.579
 an agreement that was mariano pernÃ­a 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:04.569
 I was carrying three and each time I had to 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:07.569
 play this weekend I total of 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.569
 luck 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.019
 what 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.910
 aguirre said to him says you do not leave him 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.090
 stroke specialist told him blow 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.400
 you're going to elude waiting for something I hope 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.190
 something expected is not until a moment 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.750
 I have to hook the pedals says I 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.870
 never exceed that moment that mine in 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.870
 win but now it happens that with your side 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.520
 You do not know if you knew what awaited search 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.520
 they are players that are going to happen to you 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.920
 then because he knows him knows if what 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.530
 I knew the loss to your partner 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.680
 you finish what you want to kill he said good 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:49.290
 poor kid, I would like later 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:53.819
 when having the party served as 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.200
 to say but the cholo suffered all the 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.250
 transfer from the hotel to the court 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.739
 I already suffered him speaks the greatness of a 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.159
 campus to know that messi is messi and 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.420
 treat it as such by demanding the same 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.370
 that everyone because there is no difference 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.159
 but if you knowing that each one 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.989
 It has its responsibility but good 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.510
 months and months 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.299
 if that and he knows it too 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.650
 responsibility is then for the subject 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:26.579
 of the lattice of gums can pass 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.200
 many many schools but here we 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:31.109
 happens and that is one of the virtues that 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.359
 generated the group coach us 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.760
 we know that the figure today is 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:38.290
 Emblem the flag our leo but 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.989
 we all have responsibilities 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.060
 the 1 until he was up to 23 go to 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.010
 have responsibilities to carry the 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.959
 selection to the maximum it is clear that no 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.310
 there are responsibilities scale so 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.870
 that they generate also within a field 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.060
 of game messi can make you win a 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.040
 party a good team can win you 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.420
 make a game but I can not 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.909
 to win a world cup is like that 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.530
 the schools win them, I think the 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:01.150
 important things the above all as 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.760
 all titles all titles 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.849
 championships world cups liberators 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.680
 champions but win the planteos he 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.420
 can have 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.420
 details moments that other young people 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.030
 others give that plus but will give it or that 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.389
 it is clear why 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.320
 that he can do it alone but after 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:25.919
 if the group accompanies a high level 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:28.560
 can win world cup things 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.990
 important but it is very difficult for a 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.680
 only player being one hundred percent and 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:38.820
 the others are not winning a degree in 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:41.280
 be world champion in brazil 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.510
 they played world in brazil which is because 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.250
 it is not the same to play a World Cup in 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.690
 brazil that in russia what happened in 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.570
 South Africa 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:51.960
 it's not the same I think germany that 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:54.570
 maybe it 's the same but it's Brazil is a 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.140
 plus we have above all for the 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:00.000
 rivalry that there is our then 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:03.150
 also one takes that way it would be 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.600
 something about being world champion because 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.460
 make a story but get it there 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.650
 It has that flavor that makes it so much 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.180
 better the greater injustice that you lived 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.030
 with the selection it was 4 to 0 with 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.460
 germany in 2010 how is it to be so 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.890
 close to an achievement not because I get to 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.700
 semifinals of the 90 do not come is a 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:25.380
 achievement and they see you an objection that you 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.930
 send to reality after that game 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.200
 the truth that 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.940
 it was a very hard blow because 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.950
 it was the worst blow in your career or the 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.930
 injury maybe he will go saying look at the 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.930
 injury made me 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.789
 see things differently there are also 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.889
 blows that make you mature another that 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:46.770
 you are in things differently but 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:49.530
 Well, I think there are two things that 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.840
 they passed and that agreement to zero how it was and 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:55.080
 It was very hard the time that there was 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.610
 very badly wrong very badly 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.280
 I was waiting for it because we had arrived with 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.760
 exception of passing was very very very 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.630
 muddy 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:06.910
 same as when it happened with the penitentiaries 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.580
 also in germany the team was very 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.560
 well then well you're never thinking 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.670
 what are you going to lose but if it is not and 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.490
 now I'm going to remember not how we were going 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:17.789
 coming to the court 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.770
 how we were arriving and the aspirations 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:22.790
 that we had in that past we're going 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:26.720
 we are so close 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:30.200
 and how are we going to tie up how are you in the 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.210
 second if it gets complicated but it can be 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.370
 that I call notice the third one is a 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:37.610
 massage 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:40.430
 this liquid so they are blows 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:43.040
 very strong psychological events that happen to you in 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.380
 that moment and when the match ends 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.780
 that disappear but disappear because 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.510
 is not what I thought is not what 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.810
 I expected 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:55.720
 and that way especially because it was the 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:58.330
 another in penalties in good germany 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.580
 This has left him wearing a go 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.230
 little bit more but you're getting a 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.970
 goal behind the others is a slow death 

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.970
 or it is worse
