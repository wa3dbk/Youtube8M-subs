without you modeled glance and it's

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.219 
without you modeled glance and it's
quite<00:00:56.339> unusual<00:00:56.549> we<00:00:57.269> are<00:00:57.359> architects<00:00:57.929> but<00:00:58.049> also

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:58.229 
quite unusual we are architects but also

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:01.489 
quite unusual we are architects but also
building<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.219> now<00:00:59.699> on<00:01:00.179> our<00:01:00.420> own<00:01:00.629> with<00:01:01.170> some

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:01.499 
building it now on our own with some

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:05.420 
building it now on our own with some
purpose<00:01:03.170> and<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:04.350> Richie<00:01:04.530> came<00:01:04.830> along<00:01:05.129> with<00:01:05.309> an

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
purpose and so Richie came along with an

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.560 
purpose and so Richie came along with an
idea<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.210> no<00:01:07.140> actually<00:01:07.590> um<00:01:08.030> we<00:01:09.030> know<00:01:09.180> Richard

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
idea and no actually um we know Richard

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.990 
idea and no actually um we know Richard
from<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.900> talk<00:01:10.140> we<00:01:10.350> did<00:01:10.560> similar<00:01:11.160> structures

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
from a talk we did similar structures

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.510 
from a talk we did similar structures
before<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:13.230> Switzerland<00:01:14.030> and<00:01:15.030> then<00:01:16.340> but<00:01:17.340> it's

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
before in Switzerland and then but it's

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.910 
before in Switzerland and then but it's
not<00:01:17.790> just<00:01:18.000> about<00:01:18.380> architecture<00:01:19.380> it's<00:01:19.680> also

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
not just about architecture it's also

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.160 
not just about architecture it's also
about<00:01:20.660> people<00:01:21.800> we<00:01:22.800> invited

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170

what<00:01:48.850> we<00:01:48.880> really<00:01:49.510> like<00:01:49.720> like<00:01:50.680> Maria<00:01:51.070> is<00:01:53.970> that

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
what we really like like Maria is that

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.240 
what we really like like Maria is that
it<00:01:55.120> is<00:01:55.240> it<00:01:55.510> was<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.870> first<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.350> movie<00:01:56.830> studio

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
it is it was the first the movie studio

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.770 
it is it was the first the movie studio
and<00:01:57.660> it<00:01:58.660> was<00:01:59.250> not<00:02:00.250> about<00:02:00.510> the<00:02:01.510> architecture

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
and it was not about the architecture

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.560 
and it was not about the architecture
like<00:02:02.380> in<00:02:02.560> temporary<00:02:03.400> architecture<00:02:04.240> you<00:02:04.360> have

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
like in temporary architecture you have

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.680 
like in temporary architecture you have
a<00:02:04.720> contemporary<00:02:05.440> architecture<00:02:06.450> always<00:02:07.450> have

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
a contemporary architecture always have

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.720 
a contemporary architecture always have
this<00:02:07.869> empty<00:02:08.350> space<00:02:09.190> idea<00:02:09.850> and<00:02:10.209> in<00:02:11.070> the<00:02:12.070> Edison

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
this empty space idea and in the Edison

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.380 
this empty space idea and in the Edison
one<00:02:12.940> it's<00:02:13.150> more<00:02:13.690> 20<00:02:14.380> vehicle<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.490> do<00:02:16.000> something

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
one it's more 20 vehicle to do something

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.520 
one it's more 20 vehicle to do something
else<00:02:16.570> to<00:02:16.810> produce<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.650> movie<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:19.060> I<00:02:19.810> think

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
else to produce the movie and I think

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.720 
else to produce the movie and I think
this<00:02:20.740> idea<00:02:20.950> we<00:02:21.910> we<00:02:22.480> kept<00:02:22.750> it's<00:02:23.370> not<00:02:24.370> about<00:02:24.580> the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
this idea we we kept it's not about the

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.480 
this idea we we kept it's not about the
empty<00:02:25.090> space<00:02:25.570> it's<00:02:25.810> not<00:02:26.050> about<00:02:26.490> architecture

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
empty space it's not about architecture

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.240 
empty space it's not about architecture
and<00:02:27.700> nice<00:02:28.980> nice<00:02:29.980> whatever<00:02:30.370> it's<00:02:31.180> also<00:02:31.660> about

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
and nice nice whatever it's also about

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.420 
and nice nice whatever it's also about
people<00:02:33.250> coming<00:02:33.340> together<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:34.000> meeting<00:02:34.959> and

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
people coming together and meeting and

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.490 
people coming together and meeting and
using<00:02:36.430> it<00:02:36.519> as<00:02:36.730> a<00:02:36.850> vehicle<00:02:37.780> or<00:02:37.930> tool<00:02:38.140> as<00:02:38.380> a

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
using it as a vehicle or tool as a

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.700 
using it as a vehicle or tool as a
public<00:02:38.920> space<00:02:39.130> it's<00:02:40.120> so<00:02:40.660> far<00:02:40.959> it's<00:02:41.709> not

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
public space it's so far it's not

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.040 
public space it's so far it's not
yes<00:02:43.840> but<00:02:44.840> so<00:02:45.170> far<00:02:45.470> it's<00:02:45.770> really<00:02:47.050> create

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
yes but so far it's really create

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.400 
yes but so far it's really create
success<00:02:48.470> and<00:02:48.740> all<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.610> students<00:02:50.090> on<00:02:50.930> people
