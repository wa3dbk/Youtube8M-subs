chances<00:00:20.300> there's<00:00:21.300> only<00:00:21.510> this<00:00:21.779> moment<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.490> the

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
chances there's only this moment and the

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.330 
chances there's only this moment and the
next<00:00:23.519> one

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
next one

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.850 
next one
every<00:00:26.150> one<00:00:26.360> of<00:00:26.660> those<00:00:26.870> moments<00:00:27.260> is<00:00:27.830> a<00:00:28.100> test

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:29.860 
every one of those moments is a test

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.580 
every one of those moments is a test
then<00:00:30.860> you<00:00:31.010> get<00:00:31.160> to<00:00:31.190> take<00:00:31.460> one<00:00:31.520> time<00:00:32.230> and<00:00:33.230> only

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
then you get to take one time and only

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.660 
then you get to take one time and only
one<00:00:34.190> time
