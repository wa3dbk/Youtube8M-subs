your<00:00:45.550> steps<00:00:45.970> around

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:48.880 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.820 

just<00:00:49.210> get<00:00:49.420> them<00:00:49.510> spread<00:00:49.870> just<00:00:50.200> about<00:00:50.470> evenly

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
just get them spread just about evenly

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:57.900 
just get them spread just about evenly
on<00:00:51.100> all

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.420 

and<00:00:58.000> once<00:00:58.540> you<00:00:58.660> get<00:00:58.780> upset<00:00:59.080> just<00:00:59.320> go<00:01:00.100> ahead<00:01:00.310> and

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
and once you get upset just go ahead and

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.520 
and once you get upset just go ahead and
start<00:01:00.810> rationing<00:01:01.810> it<00:01:01.900> down<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.750> you'll<00:01:05.380> want

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
start rationing it down and you'll want

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.440 
start rationing it down and you'll want
to<00:01:05.620> leave<00:01:05.770> the<00:01:06.310> closest<00:01:06.760> ones<00:01:06.970> in<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:07.150> back<00:01:07.330> of

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
the ratchet-strap far back because

the ratchet-strap far back because
you're<00:01:09.550> going<00:01:09.640> to<00:01:09.700> creep<00:01:09.970> up<00:01:10.150> to<00:01:10.180> it<00:01:10.390> you<00:01:10.540> can

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
you're going to creep up to it you can

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.270 
you're going to creep up to it you can
kick<00:01:10.900> once<00:01:11.170> you<00:01:11.320> get<00:01:11.470> tight<00:01:11.710> and<00:01:11.740> make<00:01:11.950> it<00:01:12.070> hard

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
kick once you get tight and make it hard

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.480 
kick once you get tight and make it hard
to<00:01:12.340> slide<00:01:12.610> over

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.100 

once<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.600> get<00:01:18.690> set<00:01:19.820> and<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:21.450> stand<00:01:21.720> on<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.930> for

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
once you get set and you stand on it for

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.420 
once you get set and you stand on it for
example<00:01:22.320> they<00:01:22.590> will<00:01:22.740> slide<00:01:23.010> down<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.250> little

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
example they will slide down a little

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.410 
example they will slide down a little
bit<00:01:23.690> once<00:01:24.690> I<00:01:24.810> get<00:01:25.020> up<00:01:25.049> always<00:01:25.590> bounce<00:01:25.800> on<00:01:26.070> them

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
bit once I get up always bounce on them

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.800 
bit once I get up always bounce on them
make<00:01:27.420> sure<00:01:27.600> they<00:01:27.720> all<00:01:27.840> set<00:01:32.420> but<00:01:33.420> once<00:01:33.630> they're

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
make sure they all set but once they're

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.450 
make sure they all set but once they're
set<00:01:34.220> they're<00:01:35.220> pretty<00:01:35.460> much<00:01:35.610> set<00:01:36.860> good<00:01:37.860> because

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
set they're pretty much set good because

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.460 
set they're pretty much set good because
the<00:01:38.909> truth<00:01:39.149> tapers<00:01:39.540> down<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.110> gets<00:01:40.229> fatter

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
the truth tapers down so it gets fatter

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.980 
the truth tapers down so it gets fatter
as<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.740> goes<00:01:40.890> down<00:01:41.240> so<00:01:42.680> once<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.800> get<00:01:43.890> them<00:01:44.009> set

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
as it goes down so once you get them set

00:01:44.990 --> 00:02:01.539 
as it goes down so once you get them set
that's<00:01:45.990> what<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.350> have

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.300 

and<00:02:01.640> that's<00:02:02.270> how<00:02:02.420> you<00:02:02.479> do<00:02:02.689> the<00:02:02.859> six<00:02:03.859> steps<00:02:04.130> on

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
and that's how you do the six steps on

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.800 
and that's how you do the six steps on
one<00:02:04.490> ratchet-strap<00:02:04.880> it's<00:02:05.240> pretty<00:02:05.450> simple

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
one ratchet-strap it's pretty simple

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:06.819 
one ratchet-strap it's pretty simple
it's<00:02:05.929> probably<00:02:06.229> one<00:02:06.320> of<00:02:06.409> the<00:02:06.469> simplest

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
it's probably one of the simplest

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.259 
it's probably one of the simplest
easiest<00:02:07.429> ways<00:02:08.330> to<00:02:08.360> put<00:02:08.720> up<00:02:08.840> a<00:02:10.060> platform<00:02:11.060> for<00:02:11.209> a

easiest ways to put up a platform for a
