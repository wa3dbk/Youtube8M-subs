00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.510
 Hi 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.140
 Let's talk about skin care products 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.240
 clarinha bampa who accompanies me that 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.880
 I was watching right now. 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.550
 You see, you 're noticing my whiteness. 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.700
 Today I'm going to start giving this tip to 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.579
 who is the clarinha that sometimes in the majority 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.320
 of the times almost always comes a 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.790
 message when it should not arrive 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.070
 most of the time the tone is going 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.490
 get better for the whites than 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.030
 the tone is pink because it will pull by 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:54.690
 a lighter color and it will not stay is 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.580
 ge is the face're national bases for 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.070
 I do not get it right precisely because of this 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.710
 because they are very much used 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.080
 dark logic too and they are kind 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.180
 very strange on the face in beige africa 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.070
 to me does not I'm not beginning has 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.020
 How then, if you 're too white? 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.040
 essential that you know what your 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.990
 tone of your skin because that's what 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.200
 will prevail if you're going to hit the 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.500
 color of your base or not because so color 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.630
 It's much easier now. 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.920
 More chatinha until a video about this 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.230
 explain here on the channel 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.390
 I'll leave it here for me down here. 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.150
 you go there and learn how to 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.010
 to find out the tone and color of your 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.380
 is the following after you discovered the 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.409
 tone and the color of your base for 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.050
 finding a basis is because it does not exist 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.000
 so much so, that 's precisely why 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.490
 that I do not have national base people 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.570
 Unfortunately, it has no national 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.540
 My color 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.310
 It's so sad that it means spending 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.260
 more money to have a base 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.140
 sometimes it is not that some nationals are 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.650
 Guys, but it does not work. 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.540
 I think the brand can have it and so well 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.050
 like I use from time to time is 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.330
 of the apothecary and the account 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.860
 program but the exact color does not 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.780
 there is pa 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.110
 For now they have not done so I use 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.120
 imported bases is no use, I think 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.070
 Most Girls Who Are Franchises 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.530
 how would I watch also has this 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.390
 difficulty is what are the brands that 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.910
 I like most that they are imported and that 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.940
 give super right on my skin make up 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.100
 forever binaries for sure and 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.440
 basically just there 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.720
 basically the partners three others I 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.890
 I still have to fiddle with the color even more 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.870
 clear the brand of these three brands and 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.910
 also chanel tac I have one 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.750
 national who gives me a supercert I use 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:50.170
 the lighter colors of the four brands 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.590
 It is then from the margin the cib is that the color 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.740
 clearer and practically white is very 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.230
 Good, I know you used to light or 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.990
 so it's the same face but I always 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.080
 I'm after a little more 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:09.070
 yellow not to get so white too 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.870
 suffered the 110 or feel 17 I prefer 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:15.010
 feel 17 because it has the most bottom 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.620
 yellow is there and whatever it is is always 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:22.300
 faith or haiti which are the most 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:25.300
 clear even in English as faith is white 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.340
 clearest light touch and the chanel I 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.630
 incredible use it seems she calls 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:34.000
 kiss 10 only she does not have the background 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.520
 so honored and she was super good 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.230
 on my skin and it's very good so 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.570
 these things that will use part but how 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.660
 you discover agreement with your base by the 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.940
 internet common people have no error is the 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.220
 lighter color if I ask for the 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.800
 second run together 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:54.430
 will give to my skin and gave it to me 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.920
 very easy to choose is difficult at a 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.920
 even seriously unless as I said 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.980
 the brand does not work with light colors 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:06.040
 what happens when I buy 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.780
 too dark a base for me not to 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:12.900
 It's difficult, I already use a base for 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.150
 to change the color of my image or just 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.190
 which in case I need to leave her more 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.470
 Clear when you need to leave the 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.780
 I make use of a pigment 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.430
 darker and it got darker 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.350
 When I need to, leave it clearer and 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.389
 You need a lighter pigment then 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.960
 comes with white base 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:33.030
 that same white base 'white base that 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.760
 I have for now is the face 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.190
 in bari and there is also one that I bought 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.970
 long ago the kostal feels and is 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:44.910
 base even is not pancake type anything 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.470
 type is the same white base base and is that I 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.530
 I do or just put some 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.810
 I see mixed droplets like it's too much 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.880
 they put in another mix and I do not lose 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.310
 basis that I bought because it is a 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.410
 imported base I sometimes paying dearly 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.990
 for example bought she does not eat 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.970
 eat, it's not my color, I do not 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.419
 I want to lose this base so I mix 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:08.040
 with this white base or else I mix 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.900
 with a lighter base than I have 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.680
 here in the present case is unique but 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.870
 of course I have 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.910
 the afternoon even thinks white base you 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.280
 buy on the internet, no problem, you? 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.419
 you can use sunscreen that is also 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.010
 white pa 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.350
 only to be careful because the protector 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.820
 solar does what it history in the flash 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.460
 when you shoot flash 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.220
 so do not use a bad duck to take care 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.140
 dinho but basically it is people 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.620
 its magic because in white of 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:37.830
 500 more suffer as I do for your base 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:40.500
 little objective is no use of all 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:43.500
 brands and uses the lightest and 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.419
 I always try to find the yellow background 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.720
 What, how did I tell the background that stays the most? 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:51.270
 comfortable and I'll tell you later 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.450

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:58.440
 important and always test your face to 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:06:01.620
 people can not buy base so to the eye 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:04.020
