so now right now if I keep my head up
straight<00:00:44.979> and<00:00:45.280> just<00:00:46.019> anchor<00:00:47.019> you<00:00:47.769> notice<00:00:48.100> that

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
straight and just anchor you notice that

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.340 
straight and just anchor you notice that
my<00:00:48.430> nose<00:00:48.460> isn't<00:00:49.030> touching<00:00:49.570> the<00:00:49.690> string<00:00:50.019> it's<00:00:50.260> a

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.160 
my nose isn't touching the string it's a
pretty<00:00:50.530> fair<00:00:50.799> distance<00:00:51.280> away<00:00:51.839> so<00:00:52.839> I<00:00:52.870> could

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
pretty fair distance away so I could

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.799 
pretty fair distance away so I could
keep<00:00:53.379> my<00:00:53.589> head<00:00:53.860> up<00:00:54.129> and<00:00:54.339> just<00:00:54.970> Center<00:00:55.360> the<00:00:55.570> peep

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
keep my head up and just Center the peep

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.170

on<00:00:56.049> the<00:00:56.080> target<00:00:56.739> and<00:00:56.860> shoot<00:00:57.089> this<00:00:58.089> way<00:00:58.360> or<00:00:59.320> I

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
on the target and shoot this way or I

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.250 
on the target and shoot this way or I
could<00:01:01.180> do<00:01:01.299> it<00:01:01.390> a<00:01:01.420> little<00:01:01.540> bit<00:01:01.750> different<00:01:02.110> way

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
could do it a little bit different way

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.160 
could do it a little bit different way
and<00:01:02.530> I<00:01:03.250> can<00:01:03.430> anchor<00:01:03.820> a<00:01:03.850> little<00:01:04.360> bit<00:01:04.540> higher<00:01:04.839> on

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
and I can anchor a little bit higher on

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.530 
and I can anchor a little bit higher on
my<00:01:05.379> face<00:01:05.740> so<00:01:06.190> that<00:01:06.220> I<00:01:06.400> can<00:01:06.640> touch<00:01:06.880> my<00:01:06.909> nose<00:01:07.119> to

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
my face so that I can touch my nose to

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.039 
my face so that I can touch my nose to
the<00:01:07.630> string<00:01:08.010> now<00:01:09.010> I<00:01:09.280> prefer<00:01:09.820> to<00:01:10.390> touch<00:01:10.630> my<00:01:10.840> nose

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
the string now I prefer to touch my nose

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:12.780 
the string now I prefer to touch my nose
on<00:01:11.080> the<00:01:11.380> string<00:01:11.680> because<00:01:12.070> that<00:01:12.280> keeps<00:01:12.549> the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
on the string because that keeps the

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.359 
on the string because that keeps the
relationship<00:01:13.630> between<00:01:13.930> my<00:01:14.290> eyeball<00:01:14.770> and<00:01:15.039> the

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
relationship between my eyeball and the

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.090 
relationship between my eyeball and the
peep<00:01:15.609> the<00:01:15.909> same<00:01:16.240> and<00:01:16.570> for<00:01:17.530> me<00:01:17.710> that's<00:01:18.009> just

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
peep the same and for me that's just

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.160 
peep the same and for me that's just
more<00:01:18.399> comfortable<00:01:18.700> but<00:01:19.119> I've<00:01:19.240> known<00:01:19.479> tons<00:01:19.930> of

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
more comfortable but I've known tons of

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.010 
more comfortable but I've known tons of
archers<00:01:20.560> who<00:01:20.740> are<00:01:20.859> hugely<00:01:21.369> successful<00:01:22.020> even

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
archers who are hugely successful even

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.080 
archers who are hugely successful even
though<00:01:23.229> their<00:01:23.469> nose<00:01:23.710> isn't<00:01:24.100> touching<00:01:24.969> the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
though their nose isn't touching the

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.109 
though their nose isn't touching the
string<00:01:25.509> okay<00:01:26.079> so<00:01:26.740> here's<00:01:27.189> what<00:01:27.429> my<00:01:27.670> anchor

quarter<00:02:10.630> inch<00:02:10.810> peep<00:02:11.140> in<00:02:11.410> order<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:11.770> see<00:02:11.920> your

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
quarter inch peep in order to see your

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.020 
quarter inch peep in order to see your
housing<00:02:12.460> especially<00:02:12.970> in<00:02:13.060> bright<00:02:13.240> sunlight

housing especially in bright sunlight

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.930 
housing especially in bright sunlight
so<00:02:14.990> if<00:02:15.140> you<00:02:15.260> have<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.530> quarter-inch<00:02:16.100> hole<00:02:16.610> in

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
so if you have a quarter-inch hole in

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.720 
so if you have a quarter-inch hole in
your<00:02:17.090> peep<00:02:17.390> sight<00:02:17.690> your<00:02:18.380> anchor<00:02:18.920> can<00:02:19.190> vary<00:02:19.610> a

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
your peep sight your anchor can vary a

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.840 
your peep sight your anchor can vary a
quarter-inch<00:02:20.650> without<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:21.920> knowing<00:02:22.490> it<00:02:22.610> and

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
quarter-inch without you knowing it and

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.270 
quarter-inch without you knowing it and
you<00:02:23.000> can<00:02:23.180> still<00:02:23.480> see<00:02:23.780> through<00:02:24.250> what<00:02:25.250> I

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
you can still see through what I

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.730 
you can still see through what I
recommend<00:02:26.000> is<00:02:26.270> using<00:02:26.630> a<00:02:26.720> smaller<00:02:27.050> peep<00:02:27.410> like

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
recommend is using a smaller peep like

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.699 
recommend is using a smaller peep like
an<00:02:27.890> eighth<00:02:28.160> of<00:02:28.370> an<00:02:28.490> inch<00:02:28.640> which<00:02:29.470> transmits<00:02:30.470> as

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
an eighth of an inch which transmits as

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.890 
an eighth of an inch which transmits as
much<00:02:30.980> light<00:02:31.340> as<00:02:31.640> your<00:02:31.820> eye<00:02:31.850> could<00:02:32.360> possibly

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
much light as your eye could possibly

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.250 
much light as your eye could possibly
use<00:02:33.290> in<00:02:33.560> a<00:02:33.650> low-light<00:02:34.100> hunting<00:02:34.430> situation<00:02:34.640> and
