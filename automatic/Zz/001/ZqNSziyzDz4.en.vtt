video but one thing I found with the
f2000<00:03:53.849> is<00:03:53.970> that<00:03:54.150> you<00:03:54.269> will<00:03:54.420> have<00:03:54.450> to<00:03:54.660> reload<00:03:55.049> a

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
f2000 is that you will have to reload a

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.530 
f2000 is that you will have to reload a
lot<00:03:55.349> so<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.129> extra<00:03:56.370> 15<00:03:56.730> rounds<00:03:57.060> could<00:03:57.239> be<00:03:57.359> very

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
lot so the extra 15 rounds could be very

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.069 
lot so the extra 15 rounds could be very
useful

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.420

weapon the lack of muzzle flash makes it
