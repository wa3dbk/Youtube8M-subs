which<00:01:01.510> was<00:01:01.720> not<00:01:01.870> always<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.320> case<00:01:02.350> before<00:01:02.769> the

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
which was not always the case before the

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.340 
which was not always the case before the
big<00:01:03.220> DMR<00:01:03.610> patch<00:01:03.820> they<00:01:04.509> now<00:01:04.690> do<00:01:04.750> more<00:01:05.110> damage

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
big DMR patch they now do more damage

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.230 
big DMR patch they now do more damage
and<00:01:05.590> have<00:01:05.830> a<00:01:05.860> lot<00:01:06.070> less<00:01:06.280> spread<00:01:06.640> compared<00:01:07.150> to

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
and have a lot less spread compared to

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.210 
and have a lot less spread compared to
before<00:01:07.360> the<00:01:07.690> patch<00:01:08.259> and<00:01:08.500> I'm<00:01:08.830> glad<00:01:09.040> they

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
before the patch and I'm glad they

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.499 
before the patch and I'm glad they
buffed<00:01:09.430> the<00:01:09.550> DMR's<00:01:09.910> a<00:01:09.970> little<00:01:10.210> bit<00:01:10.330> I<00:01:10.360> think

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
buffed the DMR's a little bit I think

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:12.270 
buffed the DMR's a little bit I think
that<00:01:10.840> was<00:01:11.020> what<00:01:11.170> they<00:01:11.320> needed<00:01:11.560> otherwise<00:01:11.920> they

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
that was what they needed otherwise they

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.100 
that was what they needed otherwise they
wouldn't<00:01:12.580> really<00:01:12.790> serve<00:01:13.150> any<00:01:13.450> kind<00:01:13.810> of<00:01:13.899> real

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
wouldn't really serve any kind of real

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.810 
wouldn't really serve any kind of real
purpose<00:01:14.560> except<00:01:14.830> for<00:01:15.009> maybe<00:01:15.100> making<00:01:15.430> people

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
purpose except for maybe making people

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.520 
purpose except for maybe making people
deaf<00:01:16.060> now<00:01:16.570> the<00:01:16.630> only<00:01:16.810> thing<00:01:16.960> we're<00:01:17.259> really

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
deaf now the only thing we're really

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.320 
deaf now the only thing we're really
missing<00:01:17.770> here<00:01:18.130> is<00:01:18.160> just<00:01:18.430> a<00:01:18.640> small<00:01:18.789> just<00:01:19.180> a

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
missing here is just a small just a

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.560 
missing here is just a small just a
little<00:01:19.600> tiny<00:01:20.289> DMR<00:01:21.280> audio<00:01:21.700> slider<00:01:22.060> I<00:01:22.180> think

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
little tiny DMR audio slider I think

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.690 
little tiny DMR audio slider I think
that<00:01:22.690> would<00:01:22.810> make<00:01:22.990> everyone<00:01:23.649> happy<00:01:24.399> don't<00:01:24.640> you

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
that would make everyone happy don't you

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.210 
that would make everyone happy don't you
think<00:01:25.000> anyway<00:01:25.690> so<00:01:25.750> I've<00:01:26.289> started<00:01:26.590> to<00:01:26.890> use<00:01:27.100> the

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.990 
DMR's again and i thought i would share
some<00:01:29.500> tips<00:01:29.680> on<00:01:30.009> how<00:01:30.070> to<00:01:30.190> do<00:01:30.369> well<00:01:30.580> with<00:01:30.789> them

some tips on how to do well with them

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.520 
some tips on how to do well with them
now<00:01:31.330> the<00:01:31.390> first<00:01:31.630> step<00:01:31.780> that<00:01:31.960> i<00:01:32.050> got<00:01:32.170> for<00:01:32.380> you<00:01:32.500> is

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
now the first step that i got for you is

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.830 
now the first step that i got for you is
put<00:01:33.100> some<00:01:33.369> kind<00:01:33.640> of<00:01:33.759> distance<00:01:34.270> between<00:01:34.390> you

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
put some kind of distance between you

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.200 
put some kind of distance between you
and<00:01:35.110> your<00:01:35.320> target<00:01:35.800> don't<00:01:36.399> expect<00:01:36.759> it<00:01:36.910> well

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
and your target don't expect it well

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.419 
and your target don't expect it well
with<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.509> DMR<00:01:37.930> in<00:01:38.110> close<00:01:38.350> quarters<00:01:38.830> now<00:01:39.399> i

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
with the DMR in close quarters now i

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:41.249 
with the DMR in close quarters now i
know<00:01:39.610> that<00:01:39.789> i<00:01:40.060> contradict<00:01:40.720> this<00:01:40.810> in<00:01:40.990> this<00:01:41.110> game

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
know that i contradict this in this game

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.510 
know that i contradict this in this game
play<00:01:41.470> and<00:01:41.500> you'll<00:01:41.710> see<00:01:41.890> me<00:01:42.009> taking<00:01:42.220> out<00:01:42.399> some

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
play and you'll see me taking out some

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.609 
play and you'll see me taking out some
people<00:01:42.580> at<00:01:42.880> close<00:01:43.090> range<00:01:43.360> later<00:01:43.570> on<00:01:43.810> in<00:01:44.110> the

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
people at close range later on in the

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.320 
people at close range later on in the
game<00:01:44.649> play<00:01:45.039> but<00:01:45.549> that<00:01:45.700> time<00:01:45.939> it<00:01:46.030> worked<00:01:46.150> out

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
game play but that time it worked out

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.060 
game play but that time it worked out
for<00:01:46.540> me<00:01:46.600> it<00:01:46.900> worked<00:01:47.080> out<00:01:47.200> perfectly<00:01:47.560> fine<00:01:47.799> but

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
for me it worked out perfectly fine but

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.340 
for me it worked out perfectly fine but
that<00:01:48.220> is<00:01:48.340> not<00:01:48.490> usually<00:01:48.970> how<00:01:49.540> it<00:01:49.570> goes<00:01:49.720> at<00:01:50.200> all

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
that is not usually how it goes at all

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.289 
that is not usually how it goes at all
so<00:01:50.830> keep<00:01:51.040> that<00:01:51.070> in<00:01:51.250> mind<00:01:51.520> always<00:01:51.759> try<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.119> put

so keep that in mind always try to put

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:53.700 
so keep that in mind always try to put
some<00:01:52.509> distance<00:01:52.540> between<00:01:52.900> you<00:01:53.259> and<00:01:53.290> the<00:01:53.530> guy

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
some distance between you and the guy

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.469 
some distance between you and the guy
whose<00:01:53.920> day<00:01:54.159> you're<00:01:54.369> trying<00:01:54.640> to<00:01:54.790> ruin<00:01:54.939> not<00:01:55.450> a

not<00:02:00.009> only<00:02:00.159> will<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.610> recoil<00:02:01.030> affect<00:02:01.720> your

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
not only will the recoil affect your

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.450 
not only will the recoil affect your
accuracy<00:02:02.259> but<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.650> DMR's<00:02:03.040> in<00:02:03.159> this<00:02:03.280> game

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
accuracy but the DMR's in this game

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.969 
accuracy but the DMR's in this game
still<00:02:04.030> have<00:02:04.240> lots<00:02:04.600> of<00:02:04.869> spread<00:02:05.380> okay<00:02:05.680> even

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
still have lots of spread okay even

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.289 
still have lots of spread okay even
after<00:02:06.159> their<00:02:06.280> patch<00:02:06.460> that<00:02:06.670> reduced<00:02:06.970> it<00:02:07.119> quite

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
after their patch that reduced it quite

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.359 
after their patch that reduced it quite
a<00:02:07.329> bit<00:02:07.420> and<00:02:07.780> that<00:02:08.229> spread<00:02:08.590> increases<00:02:09.220> with

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
a bit and that spread increases with

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.400 
a bit and that spread increases with
every<00:02:09.399> shot<00:02:10.149> you<00:02:10.299> take<00:02:10.540> so<00:02:10.780> take<00:02:10.959> it<00:02:10.989> easy<00:02:11.290> and

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
every shot you take so take it easy and

a<00:02:51.130> lot<00:02:51.250> more<00:02:51.370> accurate<00:02:51.820> I<00:02:51.970> would<00:02:52.120> recommend

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
a lot more accurate I would recommend

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.390 
a lot more accurate I would recommend
you<00:02:52.570> guys<00:02:52.720> use<00:02:53.019> the<00:02:53.199> folded<00:02:53.650> or<00:02:53.799> angled

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
you guys use the folded or angled

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.640 
you guys use the folded or angled
make<00:02:54.730> your<00:02:54.970> follow-up<00:02:55.390> shots<00:02:55.420> a<00:02:55.870> lot<00:02:55.900> more

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
make your follow-up shots a lot more

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.679 
make your follow-up shots a lot more
accurate<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:57.370> as<00:02:57.670> long<00:02:57.819> as<00:02:57.970> you<00:02:58.090> do<00:02:58.239> that<00:02:58.510> and

00:02:58.679 --> 00:02:58.689 
accurate and as long as you do that and

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:00.240 
accurate and as long as you do that and
keep<00:02:58.930> putting<00:02:59.260> that<00:02:59.379> distance<00:02:59.829> between<00:03:00.040> you

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
keep putting that distance between you

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.740 
keep putting that distance between you
and<00:03:00.280> your<00:03:00.579> opponent's<00:03:01.120> you<00:03:01.329> will<00:03:01.450> start<00:03:01.720> to

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
and your opponent's you will start to

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.600 
and your opponent's you will start to
see<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:02.140> true<00:03:02.379> potential<00:03:02.739> of<00:03:03.159> some<00:03:03.370> of<00:03:03.489> these

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
see the true potential of some of these

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.850 
see the true potential of some of these
DMR's<00:03:04.090> I'm<00:03:04.599> very<00:03:04.989> happy<00:03:05.349> with<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.590> way<00:03:05.680> that

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
DMR's I'm very happy with the way that

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.229 
DMR's I'm very happy with the way that
they<00:03:06.040> boundless<00:03:06.489> these<00:03:06.670> weapons<00:03:07.060> the

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
they boundless these weapons the

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.809 
they boundless these weapons the
accuracy<00:03:07.750> buff<00:03:07.959> was<00:03:08.260> definitely<00:03:08.950> needed<00:03:09.280> but

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
accuracy buff was definitely needed but

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.190 
accuracy buff was definitely needed but
I<00:03:09.849> was<00:03:10.030> kind<00:03:10.150> of<00:03:10.269> skeptical<00:03:10.629> about<00:03:10.989> them

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
I was kind of skeptical about them

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.690 
I was kind of skeptical about them
increasing<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.739> damage<00:03:12.159> as<00:03:12.340> well<00:03:12.370> but<00:03:12.640> I

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
increasing the damage as well but I

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.130 
increasing the damage as well but I
think<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:13.000> balances<00:03:13.180> things<00:03:13.629> out<00:03:13.840> nicely

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
think it balances things out nicely

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.319 
think it balances things out nicely
again<00:03:14.620> so<00:03:14.950> go<00:03:15.129> out<00:03:15.159> there<00:03:15.340> have<00:03:15.760> fun<00:03:15.970> try<00:03:16.269> these

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
again so go out there have fun try these

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.030 
again so go out there have fun try these
out<00:03:16.629> I<00:03:16.900> like<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.290> use<00:03:17.470> them<00:03:17.590> from<00:03:17.739> time<00:03:17.859> to<00:03:18.010> time

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
out I like to use them from time to time

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.589 
out I like to use them from time to time
I<00:03:18.310> think<00:03:18.549> there<00:03:18.670> are<00:03:18.700> a<00:03:18.760> lot<00:03:19.060> of<00:03:19.090> fun<00:03:19.299> to<00:03:19.450> use

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
I think there are a lot of fun to use

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.089 
I think there are a lot of fun to use
and<00:03:19.750> let<00:03:20.349> me<00:03:20.470> know<00:03:20.500> what<00:03:20.739> do<00:03:20.829> you<00:03:20.890> guys<00:03:21.040> think
