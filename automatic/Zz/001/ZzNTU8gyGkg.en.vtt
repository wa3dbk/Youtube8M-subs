00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hi guys welcome i am tatsu 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.450
 anime and today I bring you the 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.610
 review of one piece number 780 a 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.870
 capitulazo and good I hope you like it 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.870
 the video we started 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.439
 we see how this sleeve starts with side 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:30.169
 totally shattered without an arm and 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.210
 totally beaten by rufi and maybe 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.579
 clover that good did some 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.620
 intervention but good does not interest the 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.409
 case is that this character has resisted 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.649
 while so much flamingo and 

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:44.479
 It's pretty good says I'm going to kill you but 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.699
 however I'm going to leave you one last 

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:49.370
 desire tells you next what would be your 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:52.670
 last wish and this one tells you to bring 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.650
 to life back to the heart and well that 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.839
 he looks at the shoes to each of 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.629
 the people so there is an expression 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:02.330
 of these in the manga and it is quite 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.489
 great a pretty good reaction from the 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.439
 'u' seeing that he is in the worst of 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.210
 situations and nevertheless follows the 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.310
 heart advice that is to smile up 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.439
 its last moment something maybe very 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.850
 characteristic of those of but without 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.579
 But also the flamencos mentions 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.200
 something about why he has so much live to 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:21.350
 heart 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.000
 it's not heart, it obviously has 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.759
 a lot of relationship with the 'u' because good 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.090
 He saved his life and he was inspired 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.770
 also in his band for this but in 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.170
 seriously all flamingo is pissed off by 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.509
 this and then in one way or another until 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.250
 that kills him after some shots that 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.799
 hit the 'u' he left it on the floor and goes to 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.719
 give his final blow and obviously not all 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.000
 I was going to let him kill him in this 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:47.210
 moment is where lucy arrives and goes through 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.310
 the floor pissed off and really 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.750
 Wanting to kill the flamingo after 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.880
 this must reach the disintegrated type 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.039
 of the situation a little I flamengo him 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.250
 He says he is dead I do not lucense 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.049
 can you believe it makes quite a few attacks 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.750
 good but seriously frank ingo I think that 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.209
 is a character with a lot of potential and 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:09.530
 at least one that shows us 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:11.780
 inflates your arm fills it up let here from 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.000
 breastplate and then beaten flamingo this one 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.650
 he simply puts his hand and practically 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.040
 with a cobweb as well as spider-man 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.050
 because it blocks the attack of light we see 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.930
 later as impressively 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.120
 light and action power that is the common hack 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.400
 cat link to that seriously impressed me 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.010
 but nevertheless this did not do anything to him or 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.600
 flaming proving again the power 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.580
 that has as a character something very 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.920
 curious in this manga is that good in the 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.990
 cage 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.239
 that has 2 flamingo is shrinking 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.410
 already as a logical end he finds out that what 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.720
 that is really in a state 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.030
 regrettable obviously because I 'm flat and 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.880
 it slipped with the blood of this and in 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.739
 serious question will be dead light and it 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.450
 pretty pissed off with that because I swear I 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.980
 well I should not die to anyone else and what 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.050
 well we already know that it is very painful 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.940
 for him and he goes into shock so he does not 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.160
 we know how he will react seriously 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.069
 is pissed and flamingo says the 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.930
 game is over so it's a manga 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.800
 very interesting leaves us with many 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.260
 expectations 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.330
 lutfi take out some new power will use a 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.760
 of his legendary techniques or 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.580
 it will simply give all this in a fight 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.590
 trying to moron flamingo and also to 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.049
 clover that is also there and so 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.560
 we see if there is any intervention like 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.390
 from sao that in fact would be great 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.340
 so this is what I think about what 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.959
 that could be happening I hope you 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.970
 have liked the video the review if it was 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.200
 so please tell me in your like comment 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.959
 down here what do you think about this 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.030
 chapter that I was seriously very good and 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.800
 well in addition to the attitude that took a 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.690
 side I found it quite interesting 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.819
