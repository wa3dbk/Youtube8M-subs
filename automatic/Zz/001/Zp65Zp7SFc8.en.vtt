00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.590
 hello love movies friends so nice that 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.320
 you turned back to levy 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.070
 as well as channel 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.599
 Today I will introduce you a new one 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.449
 playstation 4 game in front 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:22.529
 yes, and I have that in december 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:25.269
 bought it then played through and 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.460
 have it for christmas again if 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.410
 I get a present and I show 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.510
 what time is it? 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:37.600
 Actually, that's just what it is 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.809
 the playstation 4 game looks like that 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.930
 all released from 16 here 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:48.610
 her again the characters that it is 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.320
 play goes into the game and it looks like this 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.250
 the side out and behind you can still see 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:59.199
 times so small pictures from the game 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:01.420
 even so as the whole looks like her 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.939
 is surprised you are packed but I have 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.330
 the game already played through in the 

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:08.920
 december and then sold it too 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.480
 but then I gave it another try 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.530
 That's why I show you that 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.720
 whole now was so and yes in justins 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.450
 simply interesting for me in december 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.900
 because there are not that many there 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.090
 Playstation 4 games were only available here 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.710
 a very small selection take call of 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:34.060
 Duty Fifa Angry Birds Assassin's creed 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:36.850
 There were only very few and picks 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.950
 of course you also play the players then 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.409
 have appeared new and 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.200
 That was my job with me then 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:47.020
 hanau from gamestop and so everywhere poster 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.439
 I thought that was very cool 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.979
 also looked at a gameplay trailer 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:57.399
 yes so much because it not only 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:00.490
 a pure fighting game should be because 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.789
 it is not like that and was with one 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.630
 story underlines it a bit 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.630
 is varied between these 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.340
 You fight the scenes well 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.590
 plays one really does not have such a 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.610
 little bit of history, the one maintains 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:19.060
 and by the game directs and yes to the 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:23.019
 You can do it all by yourself 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.579
 or play together so you know that 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.069
 yes, if you are now for example 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:30.569
 you can play other fighting games yes 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.920
 with the friend partner no idea 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.220
 play together against each other 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.280
 Here you can do that too you can 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.730
 I have the story through playing alone 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.329
 also made the beginning is of course like that 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:50.500
 underlines that you learn a lot 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:52.230
 need to control the combination for 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.200
 for the fights and stuff 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.510
 and yes I have everything in any case 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.060
 I played the game for a long time 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.880
 believe that on any sunday and 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.090
 have the game surprisingly 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.190
 a day really played through this is 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.569
 really very very short what I really am 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.870
 too bad 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:17.079
 because you know the playstation 4 games 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.770
 are not exactly cheap and 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.330
 then you think like that 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.070
 I have a little more of that though 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.270
 That was definitely the case in this case 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:28.910
 not so it had a few hours there 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.860
 I'm not 100 percent and all 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.490
 combos is clear but I would have it up 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:37.670
 every case through and to a game 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:41.750
 I have to say that after myself 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.790
 If you have learned that way, you can 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.180
 Of course, then great on walls 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.910
 batman plays her game superman so 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.120
 all those superheroes the joker the 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:59.270
 everyone is in this game 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:04:02.600
 and yes you have one in any case 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.940
 story that explains everything where you are 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.550
 basin and the whole falls as well 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.250
 not just seeing something different like you 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.230
 she knows from the movie and why 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.540
 I do not now tell you so by 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.780
 because I leave that open, of course 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.130
 if you buy yourself in justice then have 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.560
 her, of course, a little one 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.850
 Surprise to it and what I of course 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.470
 still has to complain about this game 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:32.900
 first the longer is really joke for 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.680
 playstation 4 game and the price completely 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.940
 clear 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.370
 and then this between videos 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.060
 see between the fight then comes 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:47.630
 this, so to speak, a story mode of 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.640
 So jerky people playstation 4 games 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:53.900
 still hunching this day 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:56.630
 I really for me that was very 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.790
 disappointing because I do not understand how 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.460
 there can be no such thing 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.890
 idea 50 60 70 euro for his game 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.990
 spend this must run smoothly with me 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.940
 you know that very much anyway 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.300
 the quality in something eighth 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.050
 and yes, I definitely have to 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.660
 find fault 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.780
 and for me it would have much more 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.710
 be much more varied 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:22.540
 One could have had so much 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.139
 you can still pack the game 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:28.210
 has been omitted but despite all 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:31.750
 I definitely enjoy it 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:34.540
 made that play through for me 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.389
 clearly it was not a bad buy now 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:41.860
 I liked to play it and for everybody 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:44.860

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.919

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:51.010
 buy a game in any case 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:53.919
 It's definitely a fighting game for the fans 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.790
 people who like that in any case one 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.700
