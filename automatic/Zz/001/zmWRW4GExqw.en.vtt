I've<00:00:28.080> got<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.410> lens<00:00:28.590> in<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.890> back<00:00:29.039> off<00:00:29.510> in

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
I've got the lens in the back off in

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.690 
I've got the lens in the back off in
here<00:00:30.869> that's<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.529> camera<00:00:31.740> shutter<00:00:32.160> this

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
here that's the camera shutter this

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.630 
here that's the camera shutter this
little<00:00:33.000> curtain<00:00:33.510> ii<00:00:33.600> thing<00:00:33.809> in<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.989> back<00:00:34.640> when

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
little curtain ii thing in the back when

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.600 
little curtain ii thing in the back when
you<00:00:35.760> press<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.210> shutter<00:00:36.239> button<00:00:37.460> and<00:00:38.460> i'm

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
you press the shutter button and i'm

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.220 
you press the shutter button and i'm
going<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.850> use<00:00:39.030> something<00:00:39.300> like<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.510> two-second

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
going to use something like a two-second

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.869 
going to use something like a two-second
exposure<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:41.010> it's<00:00:41.160> long<00:00:41.370> enough<00:00:41.610> for<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.850> to

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
exposure so it's long enough for you to

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.010 
exposure so it's long enough for you to
see<00:00:42.350> the<00:00:43.350> shutter<00:00:43.590> opens<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.840> then<00:00:45.840> light

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
see the shutter opens and then light

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.889 
see the shutter opens and then light
comes<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.680> then<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.700> closes<00:00:48.270> again<00:00:48.300> just

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
comes in and then it closes again just

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.470 
comes in and then it closes again just
like<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.350> that's<00:00:49.710> all<00:00:49.920> there<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
like that that's all there is to it the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.630 
like that that's all there is to it the
faster<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.110> shutter<00:00:52.140> speed<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.920> less<00:00:53.340> light

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
faster the shutter speed the less light

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.209 
faster the shutter speed the less light
gets<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:55.020> if<00:00:55.110> i<00:00:55.230> was<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.500> set<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.680> very<00:00:55.920> fast

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
gets in so if i was to set a very fast

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.410 
gets in so if i was to set a very fast
shutter<00:00:56.460> speed<00:00:56.820> i'm<00:00:56.969> going<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.149> go<00:00:57.239> with<00:00:57.390> a

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
shutter speed i'm going to go with a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.599 
shutter speed i'm going to go with a
500th<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.289> second<00:00:58.739> you're<00:00:59.129> not<00:00:59.280> even<00:00:59.520> going

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
500th of a second you're not even going

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.660 
500th of a second you're not even going
to<00:00:59.699> see<00:00:59.850> it<00:00:59.940> happen<00:01:00.920> there<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:01.980> go<00:01:02.129> that's<00:01:02.489> all

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
to see it happen there you go that's all

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.200 
to see it happen there you go that's all
there<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:05.250> shutter<00:01:05.519> on<00:01:05.700> your<00:01:05.880> DSLR

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
there is to it the shutter on your DSLR

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.480 
there is to it the shutter on your DSLR
camera<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.080> just<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.470> same<00:01:07.680> as<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:10.280> and<00:01:11.280> it's

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
camera is just the same as this and it's

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.480 
camera is just the same as this and it's
this<00:01:12.450> little<00:01:12.570> number<00:01:12.960> on<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.200> left<00:01:13.409> here<00:01:13.740> as<00:01:14.310> I

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
this little number on the left here as I

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.149 
this little number on the left here as I
turn<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.570> shutter<00:01:15.780> speed<00:01:15.990> dial<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:16.950> see

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
turn the shutter speed dial you can see

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.640 
turn the shutter speed dial you can see
those<00:01:17.400> numbers<00:01:17.430> changing<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.350> speed

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
those numbers changing that is the speed

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.880 
those numbers changing that is the speed
of<00:01:19.680> your<00:01:20.009> shutter<00:01:20.310> now<00:01:21.240> if<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:22.500> just<00:01:22.710> have<00:01:22.860> a

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
of your shutter now if you just have a

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.920 
of your shutter now if you just have a
straight<00:01:23.280> number<00:01:23.490> like<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.119> it's<00:01:24.720> a

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
straight number like this it's a

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.649 
straight number like this it's a
fraction<00:01:25.500> imagine<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.340> one<00:01:26.610> forward<00:01:27.150> slash<00:01:27.420> in

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
fraction imagine a one forward slash in

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.350 
fraction imagine a one forward slash in
front<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> number<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:29.159> here<00:01:29.729> you've<00:01:29.939> got<00:01:29.970> a

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
front of the number so here you've got a

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.249 
front of the number so here you've got a
one<00:01:30.990> hundred<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.650> eightieth<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.460> second<00:01:33.259> if

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
one hundred and eightieth of a second if

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.499 
one hundred and eightieth of a second if
I<00:01:34.470> get<00:01:34.680> down<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.159> lower<00:01:35.369> numbers<00:01:35.820> like<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.090> tenth

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
I get down to lower numbers like a tenth

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.440 
I get down to lower numbers like a tenth
and<00:01:36.869> Beyond<00:01:37.200> you'll<00:01:38.100> see<00:01:38.340> I'll<00:01:38.729> start<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.299> get

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
and Beyond you'll see I'll start to get

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.319 
and Beyond you'll see I'll start to get
little<00:01:40.259> speech<00:01:40.500> mark<00:01:40.860> like<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:42.060> means

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
little speech mark like that that means

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.300 
little speech mark like that that means
they're<00:01:42.570> whole<00:01:42.840> seconds<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.950> means<00:01:44.159> that's

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
they're whole seconds that means that's

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.330 
they're whole seconds that means that's
a<00:01:44.549> two-second<00:01:45.479> exposure<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:46.320> very<00:01:46.770> long<00:01:47.040> time

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
a two-second exposure a very long time

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.639 
a two-second exposure a very long time
for<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.670> shutter<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.180> be<00:01:48.299> open<00:01:48.689> like<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.439> come

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
for the shutter to be open like to come

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.639

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
there is to a shutter it's used for

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.980 
there is to a shutter it's used for
controlling<00:01:55.439> exposure<00:01:55.920> predominantly

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
creatively there's very little you can

if I set a fast shutter speed I should

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.559 
if I set a fast shutter speed I should

yes

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.050 

yep<00:02:18.900> that's<00:02:19.230> pretty<00:02:19.500> good<00:02:19.680> now<00:02:20.490> if<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:20.760> set<00:02:21.030> a

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
yep that's pretty good now if I set a

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.800 
yep that's pretty good now if I set a
slow<00:02:21.750> shutter<00:02:22.230> speed<00:02:23.300> I'm<00:02:24.300> going<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.660> go<00:02:24.750> all

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
slow shutter speed I'm going to go all

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.390 
slow shutter speed I'm going to go all
the<00:02:24.840> way<00:02:24.930> down<00:02:25.170> here<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.560> about<00:02:25.770> a<00:02:25.800> quarter<00:02:26.100> of

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
the way down here to about a quarter of

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.290 
the way down here to about a quarter of
a<00:02:26.520> second<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:28.520> movement<00:02:29.520> in<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.730> water<00:02:29.910> will

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
a second that movement in the water will

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.870 
a second that movement in the water will
blur<00:02:30.630> because<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.590> shutter<00:02:31.860> is<00:02:32.010> open<00:02:32.280> the

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
blur because the shutter is open the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.180 
blur because the shutter is open the
water's<00:02:33.480> moving<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.680> light<00:02:34.920> off<00:02:35.160> the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
water's moving and the light off the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.580 
water's moving and the light off the
water<00:02:35.640> is<00:02:35.940> consequently<00:02:36.720> moving<00:02:37.290> on<00:02:37.440> the

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
water is consequently moving on the

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:45.949 
water is consequently moving on the
sensor<00:02:38.130> so<00:02:38.610> you<00:02:38.640> get<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.180> blur

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.240 

right<00:02:46.959> let's<00:02:47.560> have<00:02:47.650> a<00:02:47.739> look<00:02:47.799> at<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.010> pictures

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
right let's have a look at the pictures

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.350 
right let's have a look at the pictures
as<00:02:51.989> I<00:02:52.989> flick<00:02:53.319> between<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.799> two<00:02:53.980> here<00:02:54.579> in<00:02:55.299> the

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
as I flick between the two here in the

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.660 
as I flick between the two here in the
first<00:02:55.750> image<00:02:56.019> where<00:02:56.829> I<00:02:56.860> use<00:02:57.099> the<00:02:57.280> faster

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
first image where I use the faster

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.789 
first image where I use the faster
shutter<00:02:57.849> speed<00:02:58.269> the<00:02:58.450> droplets<00:02:59.140> of<00:02:59.260> water<00:02:59.319> are

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
shutter speed the droplets of water are

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:00.569 
shutter speed the droplets of water are
all<00:02:59.950> frozen

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
all frozen

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.229 
all frozen
it's<00:03:01.060> absolutely<00:03:01.720> static<00:03:02.409> in<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:03.760> second

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
it's absolutely static in the second

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.000 
it's absolutely static in the second
where<00:03:04.420> I<00:03:04.450> was<00:03:04.629> using<00:03:04.780> a<00:03:05.019> quarter<00:03:05.260> of<00:03:05.500> a<00:03:05.560> second

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
where I was using a quarter of a second

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.640 
where I was using a quarter of a second
the<00:03:06.459> shutter<00:03:06.760> opened<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:07.659> water<00:03:07.930> moved<00:03:08.349> and

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
the shutter opened the water moved and

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.559 
the shutter opened the water moved and
then<00:03:08.799> the<00:03:08.950> shutter<00:03:09.189> closed<00:03:09.579> again<00:03:09.939> so<00:03:10.420> the

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
then the shutter closed again so the

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.259 
then the shutter closed again so the
water<00:03:10.810> is<00:03:11.140> blurred<00:03:11.530> that's<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.489> basis<00:03:12.909> of<00:03:13.090> the

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
water is blurred that's the basis of the

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.770 
water is blurred that's the basis of the
cotton-candy<00:03:13.690> waterfall<00:03:14.620> technique<00:03:15.450> now<00:03:16.450> in

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
cotton-candy waterfall technique now in

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.960 
cotton-candy waterfall technique now in
order<00:03:17.170> to<00:03:17.319> get<00:03:17.500> those<00:03:17.709> shots<00:03:18.099> I<00:03:18.340> had<00:03:18.730> to<00:03:18.849> do

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
order to get those shots I had to do

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.910 
order to get those shots I had to do
other<00:03:19.180> things<00:03:19.299> to<00:03:19.750> make<00:03:20.019> sure<00:03:20.290> that<00:03:20.470> I<00:03:20.590> had<00:03:20.799> the

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
other things to make sure that I had the

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.830 
other things to make sure that I had the
correct<00:03:21.250> exposure<00:03:21.700> but<00:03:22.299> I<00:03:22.329> don't<00:03:22.540> want<00:03:22.659> to<00:03:22.750> go

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
correct exposure but I don't want to go

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.869 
correct exposure but I don't want to go
into<00:03:22.989> that<00:03:23.200> right<00:03:23.470> here<00:03:23.769> and<00:03:23.920> now<00:03:24.069> I<00:03:24.340> just<00:03:24.430> want

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
into that right here and now I just want

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.490 
into that right here and now I just want
you<00:03:24.909> to<00:03:25.090> get<00:03:25.329> what<00:03:25.750> a<00:03:25.780> shutter

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
you to get what a shutter

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.349 
you to get what a shutter
what<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:26.650> shutter<00:03:26.980> is<00:03:27.280> and<00:03:27.519> what<00:03:27.879> a<00:03:27.909> shutter

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
what a shutter is and what a shutter

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.009 
what a shutter is and what a shutter
speed<00:03:28.629> is<00:03:29.579> also<00:03:30.579> to<00:03:30.970> get<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.209> blurry<00:03:31.510> shot<00:03:31.840> I

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
speed is also to get the blurry shot I

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.899 
speed is also to get the blurry shot I
really<00:03:32.500> ought<00:03:32.650> to<00:03:32.680> use<00:03:32.950> a<00:03:32.980> tripod<00:03:33.310> but<00:03:33.879> I

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:33.909 
really ought to use a tripod but I

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:35.879 
really ought to use a tripod but I
wedged<00:03:34.329> my<00:03:34.599> elbows<00:03:34.959> into<00:03:35.170> two<00:03:35.470> flower<00:03:35.769> pots

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
wedged my elbows into two flower pots

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:37.710 
wedged my elbows into two flower pots
down<00:03:36.340> here<00:03:36.639> in<00:03:36.730> order<00:03:36.849> to<00:03:37.090> keep<00:03:37.269> the<00:03:37.480> camera

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
down here in order to keep the camera

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.710 
down here in order to keep the camera
steady<00:03:38.489> so<00:03:39.489> though<00:03:39.670> you<00:03:39.730> can<00:03:40.090> use<00:03:40.329> a<00:03:40.359> shutter

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
steady so though you can use a shutter

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.500 
steady so though you can use a shutter
creatively<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:42.069> blur<00:03:42.310> or<00:03:42.549> freeze<00:03:42.819> motion<00:03:43.359> it

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
creatively to blur or freeze motion it

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.199 
creatively to blur or freeze motion it
is<00:03:43.720> predominantly<00:03:44.200> an<00:03:44.739> exposure<00:03:45.220> control<00:03:45.940> and

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
is predominantly an exposure control and

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.079 
is predominantly an exposure control and
that's<00:03:46.660> about<00:03:46.870> it
