hit my son hard summer stuff I'm looking

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.450 
hit my son hard summer stuff I'm looking
at

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.380 

that's<00:00:35.030> one<00:00:35.330> is<00:00:35.510> marriage<00:00:36.230> of<00:00:36.500> gravity

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
that's one is marriage of gravity

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.670 
that's one is marriage of gravity
translation<00:00:38.390> back<00:00:38.870> up<00:00:39.110> mass<00:00:39.320> going<00:00:39.770> down<00:00:41.680> the

translation back up mass going down the
reverse<00:00:42.980> marriage<00:00:43.340> gravity<00:00:43.820> something<00:00:44.270> that

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
reverse marriage gravity something that

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.780 
reverse marriage gravity something that
people<00:00:44.540> say<00:00:44.800> doesn't<00:00:45.800> exist<00:00:46.160> and<00:00:46.340> I<00:00:46.430> get<00:00:46.640> to

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
people say doesn't exist and I get to

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.630 
people say doesn't exist and I get to
Ally<00:00:46.940> debates<00:00:47.330> about<00:00:47.800> what<00:00:48.800> it<00:00:48.890> really<00:00:49.070> is

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
Ally debates about what it really is

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.690 
Ally debates about what it really is
well<00:00:49.910> there<00:00:50.239> are<00:00:50.860> basically<00:00:51.860> two<00:00:52.190> basic

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
well there are basically two basic

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.190 
well there are basically two basic
directions<00:00:53.030> of<00:00:53.300> every<00:00:53.480> conference<00:00:53.840> what<00:00:54.110> we

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
directions of every conference what we

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:01.390 
directions of every conference what we
have<00:00:55.000> we<00:00:56.000> have<00:00:56.739> torque<00:00:58.600> and<00:00:59.600> we<00:00:59.629> have<00:01:00.400> counter

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
have we have torque and we have counter

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.630 
have we have torque and we have counter
torque<00:01:01.660> torque<00:01:02.660> would<00:01:02.900> be<00:01:03.020> turning<00:01:03.640> difficult

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
torque torque would be turning difficult

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.999 
torque torque would be turning difficult
down<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:05.570> tour<00:01:05.780> for<00:01:05.960> people<00:01:06.380> snapping<00:01:06.890> away

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
down the tour for people snapping away

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.590 
down the tour for people snapping away
from<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:07.310> blow<00:01:07.520> kind<00:01:08.509> of<00:01:08.600> starts<00:01:09.050> with

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
from the blow kind of starts with

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.580 
from the blow kind of starts with
regular<00:01:11.600> tour<00:01:11.840> you<00:01:12.020> didn't<00:01:12.229> tips<00:01:12.710> it<00:01:12.860> back

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
regular tour you didn't tips it back

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.670 
regular tour you didn't tips it back
yeah<00:01:15.590> back<00:01:15.920> up<00:01:15.950> mass<00:01:16.600> going<00:01:17.600> forward<00:01:18.050> and<00:01:18.200> we

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
yeah back up mass going forward and we

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.370 
yeah back up mass going forward and we
have<00:01:18.740> reverse<00:01:19.070> back<00:01:19.340> up<00:01:19.580> match

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
have reverse back up match

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.000 
have reverse back up match
drawing<00:01:21.380> somebody<00:01:21.830> in

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
drawing somebody in

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.810 
drawing somebody in
now<00:01:24.430> we<00:01:24.490> have<00:01:24.640> marriage<00:01:24.940> of<00:01:25.030> gravity

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
now we have marriage of gravity

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.070 
now we have marriage of gravity
basically<00:01:27.820> I<00:01:27.880> would<00:01:27.970> use<00:01:28.180> the<00:01:28.330> late<00:01:28.510> sword<00:01:28.870> to

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
basically I would use the late sword to

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.880 
basically I would use the late sword to
illustrate<00:01:29.590> this<00:01:31.320> all<00:01:32.320> right<00:01:32.440> come<00:01:32.650> for<00:01:32.800> this

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
illustrate this all right come for this

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.220 
illustrate this all right come for this
only<00:01:33.640> be<00:01:33.820> delayed<00:01:34.090> sword<00:01:34.950> for<00:01:35.950> years<00:01:36.790> now

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.230 
only be delayed sword for years now

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:43.350 
only be delayed sword for years now
anyway<00:01:38.230> so<00:01:39.780> guys<00:01:40.780> sitting<00:01:41.260> here<00:01:41.580> go<00:01:42.580> back<00:01:42.850> do

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
anyway so guys sitting here go back do

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.750 
anyway so guys sitting here go back do
this<00:01:43.620> catback<00:01:44.620> if<00:01:45.040> you<00:01:45.100> still<00:01:45.340> like<00:01:45.490> to<00:01:45.520> do

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
this catback if you still like to do

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.120 
this catback if you still like to do
that<00:01:45.970> kick<00:01:46.900> the<00:01:47.020> guy<00:01:47.200> and<00:01:47.470> we<00:01:47.530> drop<00:01:47.770> his<00:01:47.920> height

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
that kick the guy and we drop his height

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.610 
that kick the guy and we drop his height
get<00:01:48.850> this<00:01:49.000> guy<00:01:49.150> into<00:01:49.360> pills<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:53.140> got<00:01:53.320> to<00:01:53.440> steal

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
get this guy into pills you got to steal

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.030 
get this guy into pills you got to steal
stuff<00:01:53.920> down<00:01:54.100> there<00:01:54.280> before<00:01:55.800> anyway

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040

kick a guy in the pills I'm

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.160 
kick a guy in the pills I'm
straightening<00:01:59.860> my<00:02:00.070> legs<00:02:00.310> exaggerate<00:02:00.970> this

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
straightening my legs exaggerate this

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.860

imagine<00:02:02.170> gravity<00:02:02.530> is<00:02:03.150> dropping<00:02:04.150> down<00:02:04.450> on<00:02:04.780> the

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
imagine gravity is dropping down on the

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.230 
imagine gravity is dropping down on the
target<00:02:05.260> letting<00:02:05.500> gravity<00:02:05.740> help<00:02:06.580> you<00:02:06.760> hit<00:02:07.000> down
