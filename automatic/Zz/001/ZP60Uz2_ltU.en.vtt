of a camera which has been good to us I
like<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.530> so<00:03:34.710> many<00:03:34.770> products<00:03:35.430> they<00:03:35.670> have

like the so many products they have
never<00:03:38.300> gone<00:03:39.300> wrong<00:03:40.190> which<00:03:41.190> is<00:03:41.220> also<00:03:41.580> why<00:03:41.700> I

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
never gone wrong which is also why I

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.630 
never gone wrong which is also why I
have<00:03:41.880> a<00:03:41.910> Playstation<00:03:42.480> 3<00:03:42.980> this<00:03:43.980> camera<00:03:44.430> is<00:03:44.610> a

have a Playstation 3 this camera is a
lot<00:03:44.970> smaller<00:03:46.550> and<00:03:47.550> I<00:03:47.670> thought<00:03:47.880> it<00:03:48.030> would<00:03:48.120> be

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
lot smaller and I thought it would be

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.510 
lot smaller and I thought it would be
geez<00:03:49.580> this<00:03:50.580> is<00:03:50.640> a<00:03:50.760> small<00:03:51.120> camera<00:03:52.490> it's<00:03:53.490> really

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520

geez this is a small camera it's really
light<00:03:53.910> really<00:03:54.270> small<00:03:54.540> um<00:03:55.200> first<00:03:55.980> impressions

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
the camera full 1080p HD I think it's 19

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.810 
the camera full 1080p HD I think it's 19
1920<00:04:07.200> pixels<00:04:07.740> by<00:04:07.890> 1080<00:04:08.340> so<00:04:08.970> I<00:04:09.330> think<00:04:10.050> that's<00:04:10.290> a

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
1920 pixels by 1080 so I think that's a

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.770 
1920 pixels by 1080 so I think that's a

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
in the computer you don't have to have a

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.430 
in the computer you don't have to have a
sample<00:05:34.450> included<00:05:35.020> cord<00:05:35.290> here<00:05:35.880> which<00:05:36.880> is<00:05:37.000> nice

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
sample included cord here which is nice

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.160 
sample included cord here which is nice

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.170 
so yeah I'm going to film a little bit

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.740 
so yeah I'm going to film a little bit
and<00:05:41.350> show<00:05:41.650> you<00:05:41.710> what<00:05:42.640> the<00:05:42.910> video<00:05:43.240> from<00:05:43.570> this

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
and show you what the video from this

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.600 
and show you what the video from this
looks<00:05:43.990> like<00:05:44.200> so<00:05:44.770> keep<00:05:45.070> in<00:05:45.160> mind<00:05:45.190> what<00:05:45.490> this

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
looks like so keep in mind what this

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.130 
looks like so keep in mind what this
looks<00:05:45.790> like<00:05:45.880> and<00:05:46.120> how<00:05:46.180> terrible<00:05:46.390> this<00:05:46.690> is<00:05:46.930> and

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
looks like and how terrible this is and

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:55.850 
looks like and how terrible this is and
will<00:05:48.010> be<00:05:48.070> a<00:05:48.100> nice<00:05:48.250> comparison

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.340 

okay<00:05:56.430> so<00:05:56.490> here<00:05:57.090> is<00:05:57.450> my<00:05:57.960> camera<00:05:58.650> the<00:05:59.250> old<00:05:59.460> camera

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
okay so here is my camera the old camera

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.960 
okay so here is my camera the old camera
in<00:06:01.350> the<00:06:01.470> low<00:06:01.650> light<00:06:01.980> I<00:06:02.280> think<00:06:02.460> this<00:06:02.790> would<00:06:02.940> be

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970 
in the low light I think this would be

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.670 
in the low light I think this would be
better<00:06:03.240> to<00:06:03.600> show<00:06:03.840> compared<00:06:04.320> to<00:06:04.410> the<00:06:04.500> new

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
better to show compared to the new

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.650 
better to show compared to the new
camera<00:06:05.130> because<00:06:05.940> the<00:06:06.060> new<00:06:06.180> camera<00:06:06.540> is

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
camera because the new camera is

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.220 
camera because the new camera is
supposed<00:06:06.900> to<00:06:06.990> have<00:06:07.200> some<00:06:08.660> low-light<00:06:09.660> features

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.230 
supposed to have some low-light features

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.200 
supposed to have some low-light features
so<00:06:10.620> here's<00:06:10.890> just<00:06:10.980> a<00:06:11.280> good<00:06:11.460> look<00:06:11.700> at<00:06:11.820> the<00:06:11.970> room

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
so here's just a good look at the room

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.370 
so here's just a good look at the room
and<00:06:13.200> see<00:06:13.380> the<00:06:13.530> difference<00:06:14.690> between<00:06:15.690> lighting

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
and see the difference between lighting

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:22.490 
and see the difference between lighting
and<00:06:17.660> all<00:06:18.660> of<00:06:18.840> that<00:06:18.870> uh<00:06:21.050> there's<00:06:22.050> a<00:06:22.110> video<00:06:22.410> I'm

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 
and all of that uh there's a video I'm

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:29.030 
and all of that uh there's a video I'm
cutting<00:06:22.770> up<00:06:26.030> and<00:06:27.030> now<00:06:27.690> this<00:06:28.020> is<00:06:28.350> the<00:06:28.620> nearest

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.040 
cutting up and now this is the nearest

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.450 
cutting up and now this is the nearest
camera<00:06:30.530> you<00:06:31.530> should<00:06:31.560> be<00:06:31.860> able<00:06:31.980> to<00:06:32.160> see<00:06:32.340> the

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
camera you should be able to see the

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.140 
camera you should be able to see the
difference

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150 
difference

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.660 
difference
the<00:06:33.960> colors<00:06:34.320> are<00:06:34.500> a<00:06:34.530> lot<00:06:34.710> brighter<00:06:35.040> and<00:06:35.310> it's

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:35.670 
the colors are a lot brighter and it's

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.150 
the colors are a lot brighter and it's
not<00:06:35.850> as<00:06:36.000> fuzzy<00:06:36.240> as<00:06:36.560> the<00:06:37.560> other<00:06:37.680> one<00:06:37.830> is<00:06:37.950> and

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 
not as fuzzy as the other one is and

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.220 
not as fuzzy as the other one is and
also<00:06:38.310> the<00:06:38.520> picture<00:06:38.850> is<00:06:39.000> a<00:06:39.030> lot<00:06:39.270> more<00:06:39.900> still

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:40.230 
also the picture is a lot more still

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:45.970 
also the picture is a lot more still
because<00:06:40.560> it<00:06:40.590> has<00:06:40.830> that<00:06:41.130> fancy<00:06:41.850> Sony

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:45.980 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.950 

technology<00:06:46.980> to<00:06:47.490> stabilize<00:06:48.030> the<00:06:48.330> camera<00:06:48.510> as<00:06:48.810> it

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 
technology to stabilize the camera as it

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.590 
technology to stabilize the camera as it
films<00:06:49.730> another<00:06:50.730> thing<00:06:50.940> that<00:06:51.120> you<00:06:51.180> can<00:06:51.300> do<00:06:51.450> is

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:51.600 
films another thing that you can do is

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:52.980 
you can open up the menu while you're

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:59.630 
you can open up the menu while you're
filming<00:06:53.250> and<00:06:53.660> go<00:06:54.660> into<00:06:54.840> the<00:06:55.260> settings<00:06:55.770> and<00:06:58.640> you
