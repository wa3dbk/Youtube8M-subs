00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:07.950
 hello you love today, there is mine 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.790
 evening routine and we start with that 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.010
 abschminken 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.500
 I use nivea quite like 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.210
 this cleaning fluri sometimes but 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.039
 also from the body shop the clean sinks 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.140
 continue if I rather dry skin off 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.660
 that's pretty oily today I have myself 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.380
 however, for the synergies 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.359
 cleaning towels decided 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.519
 I think that's a good change as well 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.220
 between the three products always quite 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.199
 arbitrary whereby from the body shop the body 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.489
 I always like to use butter 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.710
 when I'm very dry 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.790
 have facial skin at the time it is 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.770
 that's why I use such a 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.719
 cleaning cloth and with that I remove 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.780
 just a make-up that is always the first 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.399
 Step eyebrow lipstick my 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.590
 putter from the face and it takes too 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.289
 just fine the eyeshadow off course 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.660
 even the halves do not forget that 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.270
 But it is not cleaning that is easy 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.430
 just the rough first remove from make 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.530
 then I use the media 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.300
 Waterproof eyes make up remover that 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.949
 In my opinion the best 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.690
 removes the super fast 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.220
 eye make-up which is always important to me 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.619
 so that one does not feel that way in the eye area 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.409
 long rub rum I have a use 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.570
 Wade pro eye and just press it that way 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.909
 be aware of that and that 's one of those 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.409
 act moment so it already the 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.600
 waterproof mascara so on 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.400
 I'll take care of that a bit 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.799
 Often I need this too 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.619
 remove and then I just pull that 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.930
 always down so down and after 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.600
 above, I pull the mascara away 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.460
 but never rub such an eye 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.290
 any circling movements or something 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.869
 then you all would eyelashes selection 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.210
 So always very carefully and gently 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.700
 pull down the mascara, so to speak 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.009
 and do not pull up in all 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.869
 Things are going wild and the same 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.649
 Of course, I'm doing that as well 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.750
 another eye 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.290
 So one watt per eye is enough for me 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.240
 perfect and yes I remove it 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.640
 then I use everything from lasters 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.290
 popcorn lips madder that's just his 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.689
 lip peeling that makes the lips very 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.700
 knows that tastes so salty sweet that is 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.619
 very pleasant that I wash myself then 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.450
 but always down because I think that's 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.119
 super disgusting his old skin dolls 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.619
 I could eat it with it 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.080
 think but disgusting because I do 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.180
 not then 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.430
 I'm worried about my whole face 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.650
 to clean it again now we have 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.900
 yes, just before the make-up and taken off 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.610
 For that I use the soaps from ballet 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.290
 free washing lotions I think that's great 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.900
 I've been using them again and again for years 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.540
 and since I just a whole 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.810
 face and some just again 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.820
 very thorough and yes again just the 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.530
 last make-up reste again 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.090
 take it down and make the face easy 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.240
 nice clean if i am not 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.520
 make-up then I just use directly 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.770
 The soaps was free station and no 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.320
 damp cloths before but mostly 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.150
 I am made up and yes over 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.520
 the eye area that does not burn that 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.900
 works great that's me too 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.870
 always very important because you also the 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.430
 Remains of waterproof makeup remover 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.380
 wants to wash down so the face 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.970
 just completely clean is then 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.680
 under washed and then I use of 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.510
 I wash these everlasting ones once 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.400
 just think very hygienic and then 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.290
 I do the face off I use 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.470
 but only three I am so I tear 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.140
 I always find half through me 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.180
 that is rich and natural 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.380
 The neck also dried and the nose 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.480
 cleaned again because of the 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.700
 moisture I always have to make the 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.430
 then I use that from barriers 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.019
 on a climate antibacterial 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.700
 facial water that infects that 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.500
 so to speak again the face find that 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.330
 I am always very important when you are 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.340
 as I keep coming back with pimples 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.019
 has to fight and also reach such a 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.060
 small cotton pads i just use 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.320
 both sides and distributed it very well in the 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.540
 face and neck 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.120
 and then it is again 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.620
 face completely clean and pure and fresh 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.420
 sometimes you can see washed 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.060
 Reste if you do not stop enough 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.200
 the makeup on the viewpad has been removed 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.840
 I always find it very practical 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.269
 then I use of the Estee Lauder 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.769
 Advents Night Repair Serum I think 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.810
 that it is very very caring and 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.580
 donate moisture and since I have one 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.590
 I always like to use dry skin 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.239
 a serum that I give before that 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.130
 in my hands I'm not in it anymore 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.019
 face rum must rub but 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.910
 just nice and gentle a knock 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.820
 that will thank you your skin if 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.350
 you always get that way then yes 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.260
 you just do not fold so fast and 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.700
 of course not forget the neck 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.460
 and then I use that from weleda 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.130
 soothing facial cream from the almond 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.890
 row the mark 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.800
 I like to do it that way 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.940
 They are very rich and 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.190
 moisturizing and caring and 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.370
 the pots are on my face as well 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.320
 just do not rub around and everything 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.120
 always nice drop only one and a club 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.320
 It is getting used to but you get used to it 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.950
 I can only do that 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.670
 recommend 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.500
 then you'll stay beautiful and young forever 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.390
 of course not at all 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.010
 forget without being in the moment 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.560
 By the way, my friend just came in 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.790
 wanted to pick up a kiss but 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.230
 Unfortunately, I did not manage it 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.730
 in front of the camera though, the course is unfortunately 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.010
 not in front of the camera 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.060
 but I did not want you anyway 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.860
 withhold 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.320
 It continues with my eyes cream 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.090
 and I'm using chris deering 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.280
 Classist eye cream I find that very 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.990
 very good i want it right on my skin 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.940
 you do not have to work that much 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.430
 by itself very caring 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.050
 rich and still helps against wrinkles 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.240
 and I always believe that with middle finger 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.530
 also on the eyelids because of me 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.750
 just the feeling I have with the 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.380
 finger more control than with the 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.810
 ring finger 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.360
 Next I use this from kiko 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.760
 eyelash care for the summer for 30 days 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.500
 Every night from sleep and apply 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.960
 It should just over the night the eyelashes 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.490
 very well and that's how they should be 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.560
 stop less and last longer 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.180
 I'm very curious if that's what 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.830
 because I always waterproof 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.870
 mascara user I need 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.520
 just blink of an eye 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.650
 I brush my teeth with the frisco 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.200
 because I like the toothpaste love 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.420
 is located at aldi south and then used 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.820
 I still lip care from labello the 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.560
 vanilla macadamia i think she is very good 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.630
 from the care effect could 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.250
 to be better but I still like her 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:04.050
 I like to give it to you 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.820
 Put the packet directly on the lips with it 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.860
 the bacteria from the fingers in it 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.560
 do not spread and then I use 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.240
 of the winter may creme knows the 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.220
 possible from the fragrance very much like the 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.470
 caring effect could be something better 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.820
 but both the hand cream and the 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.920
 lip care are actually with me 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.320
 on the nightstand I wanted to but 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.240
 reluctant in the bedroom movie in bed 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.590
 That's why I have the two products 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.750
 now taken to bed 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.430
 and then creamy me so beautiful the 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.500
 hands and above all things also the 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.940
 arms and elbows with me 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.740
 simply not the product anymore 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.120
 on the palms that may have 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.370
 I do not like it that much 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.770
 the feeling and yes it was already 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:44.030
 with my evening routine i hope that 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.030
 you liked the video
