inch<00:01:58.380> screen<00:01:58.829> but<00:01:58.860> it's<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.250> little<00:01:59.340> bit<00:01:59.490> wider

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
inch screen but it's a little bit wider

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.450 
inch screen but it's a little bit wider
because<00:02:00.000> this<00:02:00.659> keypad<00:02:01.110> here<00:02:01.469> our<00:02:01.979> keyboard

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
because this keypad here our keyboard

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.240 
because this keypad here our keyboard
has<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.909> numeric<00:02:03.420> keypad<00:02:03.630> on<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.049> side<00:02:04.320> which

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
has a numeric keypad on the side which

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.180 
has a numeric keypad on the side which
both<00:02:05.670> my<00:02:05.939> laptops<00:02:06.600> before<00:02:07.079> did<00:02:07.229> not<00:02:07.380> have<00:02:07.710> so

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
both my laptops before did not have so

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.880 
both my laptops before did not have so
this<00:02:08.759> one<00:02:08.940> didn't<00:02:09.179> quite<00:02:09.360> fit<00:02:09.720> on<00:02:09.899> the

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
this one didn't quite fit on the

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.369 
this one didn't quite fit on the
cooling<00:02:12.370> fan<00:02:12.610> as<00:02:12.879> well<00:02:13.329> as<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.989> other<00:02:14.140> ones

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
cooling fan as well as the other ones

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.649 
cooling fan as well as the other ones
did<00:02:14.650> but<00:02:14.890> I<00:02:15.099> took<00:02:15.370> that<00:02:15.519> out<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:16.060> looks<00:02:16.569> like

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 
did but I took that out and looks like

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:17.910 
did but I took that out and looks like
it's<00:02:16.870> still<00:02:17.019> running<00:02:17.170> fine<00:02:17.530> it

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
it's still running fine it

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.440 
it's still running fine it
I<00:02:17.950> think<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.459> cooling<00:02:18.730> fan<00:02:18.909> might<00:02:19.209> actually

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
I think the cooling fan might actually

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.479 
I think the cooling fan might actually
not<00:02:19.810> help<00:02:20.079> it<00:02:20.500> might<00:02:20.769> actually<00:02:21.010> make<00:02:21.220> it<00:02:21.280> worse

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
not help it might actually make it worse

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.819 
not help it might actually make it worse
by<00:02:21.519> blowing<00:02:22.150> dust<00:02:22.360> in<00:02:22.569> there<00:02:22.780> but<00:02:23.530> anyways

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829 
by blowing dust in there but anyways

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:25.410 
by blowing dust in there but anyways
it's<00:02:24.010> got<00:02:24.129> this<00:02:24.280> really<00:02:24.579> nice<00:02:24.849> finish<00:02:25.180> right

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
it's got this really nice finish right

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.270 
it's got this really nice finish right
here<00:02:25.659> that<00:02:25.810> makes<00:02:26.019> it<00:02:26.170> look<00:02:26.379> look<00:02:26.890> like<00:02:27.069> it's

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
here that makes it look look like it's

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.539 
here that makes it look look like it's
aluminum<00:02:27.730> but<00:02:27.909> it's<00:02:28.060> actually<00:02:28.329> just<00:02:28.510> plastic

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
aluminum but it's actually just plastic

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.940 
aluminum but it's actually just plastic
it's<00:02:30.549> sort<00:02:30.939> of<00:02:31.000> greyish<00:02:31.480> blue

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
it's sort of greyish blue

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.289 
it's sort of greyish blue
let<00:02:32.950> me<00:02:33.010> see<00:02:33.189> we<00:02:33.280> can<00:02:33.400> get<00:02:33.459> a<00:02:33.519> closer<00:02:33.849> look<00:02:34.239> you

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
let me see we can get a closer look you

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.599 
let me see we can get a closer look you
know<00:02:34.510> like<00:02:35.049> I<00:02:35.079> said<00:02:35.319> it's<00:02:35.769> ER<00:02:36.069> looks<00:02:36.370> like

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609 
know like I said it's ER looks like

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.880 
know like I said it's ER looks like
aluminum<00:02:36.959> but<00:02:37.959> it's<00:02:38.109> actually<00:02:38.439> so<00:02:38.680> it's<00:02:38.829> a

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
aluminum but it's actually so it's a

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.440 
aluminum but it's actually so it's a
little<00:02:39.069> bit<00:02:39.189> dark<00:02:39.370> on<00:02:39.489> this<00:02:39.670> side<00:02:39.909> but<00:02:40.150> as<00:02:40.299> you

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
little bit dark on this side but as you

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.119 
little bit dark on this side but as you
can<00:02:40.510> see<00:02:40.720> you<00:02:40.780> got<00:02:40.959> your<00:02:41.109> standard<00:02:41.290> analog<00:02:41.890> VGA

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
can see you got your standard analog VGA

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:47.059 
can see you got your standard analog VGA
video<00:02:42.909> output<00:02:43.739> HDMI<00:02:44.739> output<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.549> then<00:02:46.030> a

Ethernet<00:02:48.069> port<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:48.639> two<00:02:49.060> USB<00:02:49.780> 3.0<00:02:50.349> ports<00:02:50.739> I

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
Ethernet port and two USB 3.0 ports I

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.699 
Ethernet port and two USB 3.0 ports I
haven't<00:02:51.819> really<00:02:52.060> experienced<00:02:52.569> full<00:02:52.989> 3.0<00:02:53.470> yet

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
haven't really experienced full 3.0 yet

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.530 
haven't really experienced full 3.0 yet

because all my devices are still only
2.0<00:02:56.109> on<00:02:56.319> the<00:02:56.439> right<00:02:56.620> side<00:02:56.889> you<00:02:57.069> do<00:02:57.220> have<00:02:57.609> a

on<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:49.000> bottom<00:03:49.239> of<00:03:49.299> the<00:03:49.359> laptop<00:03:49.709> as<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:50.799> top

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
on the bottom of the laptop as the top

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.469 
on the bottom of the laptop as the top
here<00:03:51.250> just<00:03:51.280> makes<00:03:51.729> it<00:03:51.849> look<00:03:51.970> like<00:03:52.180> there's<00:03:52.389> a

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:52.479 
here just makes it look like there's a

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:53.819 
here just makes it look like there's a
sound<00:03:52.659> bar<00:03:52.930> but<00:03:53.199> it's<00:03:53.319> actually<00:03:53.590> just<00:03:53.650> a

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
sound bar but it's actually just a

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.969 
sound bar but it's actually just a
design<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:55.239> overall<00:03:55.359> speaker's<00:03:55.930> there<00:03:56.709> /

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:56.979 
design the overall speaker's there /

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:59.159 
design the overall speaker's there /
they<00:03:57.159> couldn't<00:03:57.400> get<00:03:57.519> pretty<00:03:57.699> loud<00:03:58.139> when<00:03:59.139> I

00:03:59.159 --> 00:03:59.169 
they couldn't get pretty loud when I

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:00.539 
they couldn't get pretty loud when I
first<00:03:59.530> turn<00:03:59.739> on<00:03:59.799> the<00:03:59.859> laptop<00:04:00.040> they<00:04:00.400> didn't

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
first turn on the laptop they didn't

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.490 
first turn on the laptop they didn't
really<00:04:00.639> need<00:04:00.819> much<00:04:01.000> breaking<00:04:01.389> in<00:04:01.540> they<00:04:02.379> can

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
really need much breaking in they can

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.089 
really need much breaking in they can
get<00:04:02.590> quite<00:04:02.859> sharp<00:04:03.190> at<00:04:03.340> times<00:04:03.609> so<00:04:04.650> not<00:04:05.650> not<00:04:05.979> too

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
get quite sharp at times so not not too

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.180 
get quite sharp at times so not not too
bad<00:04:06.280> but<00:04:06.720> overall<00:04:07.720> I<00:04:07.750> listen<00:04:08.349> to<00:04:08.590> music<00:04:08.739> all

that over my headphones only at times I

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.729 
that over my headphones only at times I
use<00:04:11.829> the<00:04:12.069> speakers<00:04:12.459> but<00:04:13.359> when<00:04:14.260> I<00:04:14.290> do<00:04:14.379> I'm

this<00:04:38.140> laptop<00:04:38.320> is<00:04:38.800> where<00:04:39.010> they<00:04:39.160> place<00:04:39.910> this<00:04:40.180> SD

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
this laptop is where they place this SD

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.410 
this laptop is where they place this SD
card<00:04:40.810> slot<00:04:41.130> because<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:42.370> way<00:04:42.490> it<00:04:42.610> is<00:04:42.760> it's<00:04:43.390> a

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
card slot because the way it is it's a

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.700 
card slot because the way it is it's a
little<00:04:43.570> bit<00:04:43.660> harder<00:04:43.930> for<00:04:44.140> me<00:04:44.290> to<00:04:44.320> actually

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
little bit harder for me to actually

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:45.570 
little bit harder for me to actually
take<00:04:44.890> out<00:04:45.010> the<00:04:45.100> card

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
take out the card

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.270 
take out the card
I<00:04:45.610> usually<00:04:46.240> just<00:04:46.660> slip<00:04:47.170> my<00:04:47.320> finger<00:04:47.650> under<00:04:48.160> it

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
I usually just slip my finger under it

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.090 
I usually just slip my finger under it
and<00:04:48.430> then<00:04:48.640> you<00:04:49.120> know<00:04:49.210> try<00:04:49.450> to<00:04:49.560> move<00:04:50.560> it<00:04:50.680> out<00:04:50.830> but

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
and then you know try to move it out but

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.250 
and then you know try to move it out but
it's<00:04:51.400> not<00:04:51.700> to<00:04:52.270> a<00:04:52.300> point<00:04:52.570> where<00:04:52.690> you<00:04:52.870> press<00:04:53.110> it

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
it's not to a point where you press it

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.620 
it's not to a point where you press it
in<00:04:53.350> to<00:04:53.380> eject<00:04:53.860> it<00:04:54.010> or<00:04:54.550> anything<00:04:55.030> else<00:04:55.300> said

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
in to eject it or anything else said

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.450 
in to eject it or anything else said
also<00:04:55.810> it's<00:04:56.200> a<00:04:56.260> little<00:04:56.440> bit<00:04:56.560> hard<00:04:56.770> but<00:04:56.980> it<00:04:57.250> gets

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
also it's a little bit hard but it gets

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.930 
also it's a little bit hard but it gets
out<00:04:58.200> but<00:04:59.200> yeah<00:05:00.100> that<00:05:00.280> is<00:05:00.370> one<00:05:00.520> of<00:05:00.640> the<00:05:00.700> things<00:05:00.850> I

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
out but yeah that is one of the things I

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.820 
out but yeah that is one of the things I
do<00:05:01.000> dislike<00:05:01.450> about<00:05:01.480> this<00:05:01.810> laptop<00:05:02.050> which<00:05:02.650> they

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
do dislike about this laptop which they

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.470 
do dislike about this laptop which they
could<00:05:03.010> improve<00:05:03.250> that<00:05:03.550> or<00:05:03.850> move<00:05:04.210> it<00:05:04.300> to<00:05:04.330> the

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
could improve that or move it to the

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.140 
could improve that or move it to the
side<00:05:04.690> I<00:05:05.050> guess<00:05:05.830> and<00:05:06.700> then<00:05:06.790> some<00:05:07.000> other

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
side I guess and then some other

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.180 
side I guess and then some other
materials<00:05:07.750> a<00:05:07.840> laptop<00:05:08.320> like<00:05:08.350> here<00:05:08.890> where<00:05:09.040> the

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
materials a laptop like here where the

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.280 
materials a laptop like here where the
keyboard<00:05:09.700> is<00:05:09.880> it's<00:05:10.120> got<00:05:10.330> this<00:05:10.480> nice<00:05:10.810> smooth

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
keyboard is it's got this nice smooth

keyboard is it's got this nice smooth
black<00:05:11.800> finish<00:05:12.310> it's<00:05:13.240> not<00:05:13.420> piano<00:05:13.930> black<00:05:14.260> but

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
black finish it's not piano black but

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.150 
black finish it's not piano black but
it's<00:05:14.890> it's<00:05:15.790> just<00:05:16.360> a<00:05:16.540> smooth<00:05:16.810> black<00:05:17.080> finish<00:05:17.560> and

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
it's it's just a smooth black finish and

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.860 
it's it's just a smooth black finish and
it<00:05:18.700> doesn't<00:05:18.970> feel<00:05:19.090> cheap<00:05:19.120> at<00:05:19.480> all<00:05:19.630> looks

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
it doesn't feel cheap at all looks

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.410 
it doesn't feel cheap at all looks
really<00:05:20.020> nice<00:05:20.350> for<00:05:21.340> the<00:05:21.400> bezel<00:05:21.760> of<00:05:21.910> the<00:05:22.060> screen

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.420 
really nice for the bezel of the screen

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.780 
really nice for the bezel of the screen
it's<00:05:22.690> got<00:05:23.020> like<00:05:23.230> more<00:05:23.500> of<00:05:23.530> a<00:05:23.680> matte<00:05:24.040> color<00:05:24.370> to

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
it's got like more of a matte color to

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.090 
it's got like more of a matte color to
it<00:05:24.970> makes<00:05:25.960> it<00:05:26.080> look<00:05:26.230> a<00:05:26.350> little<00:05:26.620> bit<00:05:26.830> cheaper

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
it makes it look a little bit cheaper

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.400 
it makes it look a little bit cheaper
but<00:05:27.550> I've<00:05:28.450> gotten<00:05:28.780> used<00:05:28.900> to<00:05:29.020> it<00:05:29.200> now<00:05:29.380> and

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
but I've gotten used to it now and

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.490 
but I've gotten used to it now and
overall<00:05:30.220> it's<00:05:30.370> not<00:05:30.550> too<00:05:30.760> bad<00:05:30.970> I<00:05:31.330> think<00:05:32.020> I<00:05:32.290> like

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
overall it's not too bad I think I like

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.850 
overall it's not too bad I think I like
it<00:05:32.530> better<00:05:32.800> than<00:05:33.070> my<00:05:34.030> HP's<00:05:34.510> like<00:05:35.170> glossy<00:05:35.650> black

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
it better than my HP's like glossy black

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.860 
it better than my HP's like glossy black
where<00:05:36.250> it<00:05:36.430> gets<00:05:36.640> scratched<00:05:36.970> really<00:05:37.420> easily<00:05:37.750> I

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
where it gets scratched really easily I

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.120 
where it gets scratched really easily I
think<00:05:38.050> you<00:05:38.140> can<00:05:38.290> see<00:05:38.470> all<00:05:38.590> the<00:05:38.680> scratch<00:05:38.980> and

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
think you can see all the scratch and

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.420 
think you can see all the scratch and
then<00:05:39.250> for<00:05:39.550> the<00:05:39.850> outside<00:05:40.330> it's<00:05:40.660> the<00:05:40.750> same

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
then for the outside it's the same

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.920 
then for the outside it's the same
finish<00:05:42.430> like<00:05:42.850> the<00:05:43.120> aluminum<00:05:43.300> finish<00:05:43.720> that<00:05:43.900> I

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
finish like the aluminum finish that I

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.830 
finish like the aluminum finish that I
was<00:05:44.020> talking<00:05:44.230> about<00:05:44.260> really<00:05:45.250> nice<00:05:45.520> um<00:05:46.120> I've

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
this is just the look at this laptop I

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.370 
this is just the look at this laptop I
don't<00:06:00.760> have<00:06:00.940> too<00:06:01.180> much<00:06:01.360> to<00:06:01.570> say<00:06:01.750> about<00:06:01.870> it<00:06:02.200> it's

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
don't have too much to say about it it's

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.870 
don't have too much to say about it it's
been<00:06:02.560> running<00:06:02.830> really<00:06:03.220> good<00:06:03.400> and<00:06:03.580> smooth

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
been running really good and smooth

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.590 
been running really good and smooth
lately

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
lately

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.750 
lately
the<00:06:04.990> processor<00:06:05.620> I've<00:06:06.250> been<00:06:06.400> doing<00:06:06.610> a<00:06:06.640> lot<00:06:06.700> of

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:06.760 
the processor I've been doing a lot of

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.700 
the processor I've been doing a lot of
video<00:06:07.030> rendering<00:06:07.450> with<00:06:07.570> it<00:06:07.810> all<00:06:08.320> my<00:06:08.470> previous

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
video rendering with it all my previous

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.750 
video rendering with it all my previous
videos<00:06:09.420> from<00:06:10.590> the<00:06:11.590> HP<00:06:12.310> when<00:06:12.460> it<00:06:12.550> broke<00:06:12.730> down

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
videos from the HP when it broke down

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.760 
videos from the HP when it broke down
until<00:06:13.210> now<00:06:13.360> it's<00:06:13.630> all<00:06:13.840> done<00:06:14.170> with<00:06:14.380> this<00:06:14.500> laptop

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 
until now it's all done with this laptop

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.410 
until now it's all done with this laptop
and<00:06:15.100> I<00:06:15.190> gotta<00:06:15.340> say<00:06:15.490> there's<00:06:15.970> a<00:06:16.120> huge

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:16.420 
and I gotta say there's a huge

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.050 
and I gotta say there's a huge
improvement<00:06:17.190> compared<00:06:18.190> to<00:06:18.220> my<00:06:18.340> other<00:06:18.370> laptops

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
improvement compared to my other laptops

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.420 
improvement compared to my other laptops
which<00:06:19.330> had<00:06:19.600> AMD<00:06:20.050> processor<00:06:20.590> in<00:06:20.740> it<00:06:20.890> but<00:06:21.340> of

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 
which had AMD processor in it but of

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.250 
which had AMD processor in it but of
course<00:06:21.610> it<00:06:21.730> probably<00:06:22.030> was<00:06:22.150> a<00:06:22.180> lower<00:06:22.450> end

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
course it probably was a lower end

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:28.040 
course it probably was a lower end
processor<00:06:24.010> of<00:06:24.250> the<00:06:24.280> AMD<00:06:25.320> visions<00:06:26.320> but

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
processor of the AMD visions but

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.170 
processor of the AMD visions but
fairly<00:06:28.979> happy<00:06:29.099> with<00:06:29.220> it<00:06:29.490> it's<00:06:29.759> been<00:06:29.910> running

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180 
fairly happy with it it's been running

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.029 
fairly happy with it it's been running
warm<00:06:30.720> I<00:06:30.930> guess<00:06:31.139> I<00:06:31.349> haven't<00:06:31.530> gotten<00:06:31.800> it<00:06:31.889> to<00:06:32.009> a

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 
warm I guess I haven't gotten it to a

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:33.499 
warm I guess I haven't gotten it to a
point<00:06:32.220> where<00:06:32.370> it's<00:06:32.580> hot<00:06:32.759> I<00:06:32.789> hope<00:06:33.210> it<00:06:33.360> doesn't

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:33.509 
point where it's hot I hope it doesn't

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:35.450 
point where it's hot I hope it doesn't
get<00:06:33.750> to<00:06:33.840> that<00:06:33.990> point<00:06:34.229> otherwise<00:06:34.919> that'd<00:06:35.310> be

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 
get to that point otherwise that'd be

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.580 
get to that point otherwise that'd be
sort<00:06:35.849> of<00:06:35.879> did<00:06:36.030> disappointed<00:06:36.810> but<00:06:36.900> it<00:06:37.020> is<00:06:37.560> a

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
sort of did disappointed but it is a

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.999 
sort of did disappointed but it is a
laptop<00:06:37.860> so<00:06:38.340> can't<00:06:38.970> expect<00:06:39.210> too<00:06:39.330> much<00:06:39.479> and<00:06:40.440> yeah
