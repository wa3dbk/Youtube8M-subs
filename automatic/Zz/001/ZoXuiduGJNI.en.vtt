about the key components of history exam
and<00:00:08.610> medical<00:00:08.700> decision<00:00:09.179> making<00:00:09.209> but<00:00:10.200> how<00:00:10.320> do

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:10.379 
and medical decision making but how do

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:12.980 
and medical decision making but how do
you<00:00:10.469> apply<00:00:10.740> this<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:11.370> actually<00:00:11.490> NM<00:00:11.969> coding<00:00:12.360> ie

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
you apply this to actually NM coding ie

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.289 
you apply this to actually NM coding ie
how<00:00:13.410> do<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.589> change<00:00:13.919> your<00:00:14.099> behavior<00:00:14.759> when<00:00:15.179> it

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
how do you change your behavior when it

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.550 
how do you change your behavior when it
comes<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.660> actually<00:00:15.990> patient<00:00:16.410> management

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
comes to actually patient management

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.980 
comes to actually patient management
services<00:00:17.220> that's<00:00:17.970> what<00:00:18.180> this<00:00:18.360> course<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.840> all

when it comes to documenting your
patient<00:00:22.590> encounters<00:00:23.750> the<00:00:24.750> best<00:00:24.960> way<00:00:25.110> to<00:00:25.170> think

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
patient encounters the best way to think

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.320 
patient encounters the best way to think
about<00:00:25.560> E&amp;M<00:00:25.890> coding<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.700> that<00:00:26.940> this<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.210> how

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
about E&amp;M coding is that this is how

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.390 
about E&amp;M coding is that this is how
physicians<00:00:27.590> translate<00:00:28.590> their<00:00:28.890> cognitive

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
physicians translate their cognitive

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.619 
physicians translate their cognitive
labor<00:00:29.670> into<00:00:30.510> actual<00:00:30.870> reimbursement<00:00:31.650> to

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629 
labor into actual reimbursement to

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:34.970 
labor into actual reimbursement to
optimize<00:00:33.629> reimbursement<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.469> have<00:00:34.589> to<00:00:34.739> code

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
optimize reimbursement you have to code

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.739 
optimize reimbursement you have to code
correctly<00:00:35.190> for<00:00:36.089> example<00:00:36.449> if<00:00:36.600> you

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:36.749 
correctly for example if you

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:38.689 
correctly for example if you
inadvertently<00:00:36.960> down<00:00:37.679> code<00:00:38.039> a<00:00:38.070> level<00:00:38.489> for

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
inadvertently down code a level for

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:40.939 
inadvertently down code a level for
established<00:00:39.210> office<00:00:39.539> patient<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.409> level<00:00:40.589> 3

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
established office patient to a level 3

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:42.560 
established office patient to a level 3
patient<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.940> would<00:00:42.059> decrease<00:00:42.510> your

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
patient you would decrease your

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.630 
patient you would decrease your
reimbursement<00:00:42.960> by<00:00:43.469> about<00:00:43.679> fifty<00:00:44.039> percent<00:00:44.070> for

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
reimbursement by about fifty percent for

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.700 
reimbursement by about fifty percent for
that<00:00:44.760> visit<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.839> it's<00:00:45.989> important<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.440> get<00:00:46.559> the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
that visit so it's important to get the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.119 
that visit so it's important to get the
code<00:00:46.920> right<00:00:47.190> each<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.730> every<00:00:47.969> time

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
code right each and every time

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.349 
code right each and every time
unfortunately<00:00:50.129> most<00:00:50.339> doctors<00:00:50.670> simply<00:00:51.030> do<00:00:51.329> not

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:51.359 
unfortunately most doctors simply do not

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:53.630 
unfortunately most doctors simply do not
code<00:00:51.899> correctly<00:00:52.140> because<00:00:52.890> they<00:00:53.249> let<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
code correctly because they let the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.849 
code correctly because they let the
documentation<00:00:54.359> happen<00:00:54.780> basically<00:00:55.350> at<00:00:55.440> random

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 
documentation happen basically at random

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:57.770 
documentation happen basically at random
without<00:00:56.489> really<00:00:56.670> thinking<00:00:56.760> about<00:00:57.269> it<00:00:57.479> in<00:00:57.690> a

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
without really thinking about it in a

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.559 
without really thinking about it in a
systematic<00:00:58.289> manner<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:59.399> leads<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.850> poor<00:01:00.179> NM

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:00.569 
systematic manner this leads to poor NM

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:02.930 
systematic manner this leads to poor NM
compliance<00:01:01.139> and<00:01:01.350> an<00:01:01.739> imperfect<00:01:02.339> translation

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
compliance and an imperfect translation

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.319 
compliance and an imperfect translation
of<00:01:03.059> cognitive<00:01:03.510> labor<00:01:03.749> into<00:01:04.229> reimbursement<00:01:05.329> so

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:06.329 
of cognitive labor into reimbursement so

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:08.030 
of cognitive labor into reimbursement so
the<00:01:06.450> obvious<00:01:06.570> question<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.380> isn't<00:01:07.710> there<00:01:08.009> a

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
the obvious question is isn't there a

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.499 
the obvious question is isn't there a
better<00:01:08.369> way<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.640> apply<00:01:08.969> two<00:01:09.090> key<00:01:09.360> components

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
better way to apply two key components

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.840 
better way to apply two key components
in<00:01:09.960> daily<00:01:10.290> practice<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.399> way<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.670> actually

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
in daily practice in a way that actually

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.090 
in daily practice in a way that actually
makes<00:01:12.299> sense<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.290> answer<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.530> yes<00:01:13.649> and

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
makes sense and the answer is yes and

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.980 
makes sense and the answer is yes and
it's<00:01:14.250> called<00:01:14.490> rational<00:01:15.149> physician<00:01:15.600> coding

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
it's called rational physician coding

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.420 
it's called rational physician coding
and<00:01:16.560> that's<00:01:16.710> what<00:01:16.829> this<00:01:16.950> course<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.369> about

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
and that's what this course is about

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.580 
and that's what this course is about
will<00:01:18.329> show<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.539> how<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.750> select<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.320> target
