00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
so yeah let's check it out I had nine

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.490 
so yeah let's check it out I had nine
FPS<00:02:54.069> now<00:02:54.580> I<00:02:54.610> have<00:02:54.970> 61<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.890> thing<00:02:57.190> is<00:02:57.220> that

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
FPS now I have 61 and the thing is that

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.710 
FPS now I have 61 and the thing is that
perhaps<00:02:59.500> only<00:02:59.890> records<00:03:00.489> with<00:03:00.670> 60fps<00:03:01.150> you

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
perhaps only records with 60fps you

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.630 
perhaps only records with 60fps you
can't<00:03:01.989> record<00:03:02.290> any<00:03:02.620> higher<00:03:02.920> than<00:03:03.130> that<00:03:03.190> that

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
can't record any higher than that that

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.630 
can't record any higher than that that
is<00:03:04.209> impossible<00:03:04.510> so<00:03:05.380> right<00:03:05.739> now<00:03:05.769> you<00:03:06.040> will<00:03:06.489> have

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
is impossible so right now you will have

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.210 
is impossible so right now you will have
like<00:03:06.850> 90<00:03:07.420> FPS<00:03:07.840> you<00:03:08.049> will<00:03:08.200> have<00:03:08.320> like<00:03:08.500> 100<00:03:09.070> you

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
like 90 FPS you will have like 100 you

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.280 
like 90 FPS you will have like 100 you
would<00:03:09.370> maybe<00:03:09.519> have<00:03:09.760> like<00:03:09.910> 200<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:11.019> thing<00:03:11.260> is

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
would maybe have like 200 the thing is

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.890 
would maybe have like 200 the thing is
that<00:03:11.440> I<00:03:11.829> actually<00:03:12.070> have<00:03:12.459> like<00:03:12.609> maybe<00:03:13.060> 200<00:03:13.750> now

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
that I actually have like maybe 200 now

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.259 
that I actually have like maybe 200 now
the<00:03:14.470> thing<00:03:14.709> is<00:03:14.739> that<00:03:14.890> fraps<00:03:15.340> can't<00:03:15.790> record

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
the thing is that fraps can't record

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.319 
the thing is that fraps can't record
higher<00:03:16.780> than<00:03:17.019> 60<00:03:17.470> FS<00:03:17.799> so<00:03:18.370> you<00:03:18.430> you<00:03:18.910> are<00:03:19.060> going

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
higher than 60 FS so you you are going

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.020 
higher than 60 FS so you you are going
you<00:03:19.540> have<00:03:19.720> like<00:03:19.900> insane<00:03:20.709> you<00:03:21.489> know<00:03:21.579> it's
