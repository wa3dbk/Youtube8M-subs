 Hi, YouTube offers a service called Automatic Translations 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.620
 This service has been spread over the years for videos in English 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.220
 She just came out for French videos 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:17.020
 Principle, YouTube copies all French sounds for video to automatically create translations 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.820
 It is very convenient for people who are learning French or hearing impaired. 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.580
 To show you the result, I suggest you activate automatic translation in my most watched video 

00:00:25.586 --> 00:00:31.706
 Ciprian meets the bark and re-words based on subtitles, it looks like this: 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.160
 Bon Bah There is a pit where it starts well and it was not to be very important 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.640
 Another hole, those who learn French is dÃ©merdent 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.300
 There is still a hole, that is for hearing impairment 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.680
 To finish a small hole ... 

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.280
 As I said, life is a pill. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.500
 Bye .
