00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
case which is really great for

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.000 
case which is really great for
protection<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.930> it<00:00:22.439> will<00:00:22.529> keep<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.830> knife

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
protection and it will keep the knife

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.550 
protection and it will keep the knife
nice<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.060> clean<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.330> protected<00:00:25.080> while<00:00:25.320> it's

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
nice and clean and protected while it's

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.189 
nice and clean and protected while it's
on<00:00:25.859> your<00:00:26.039> belt<00:00:26.220> as<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.330> see<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.660> come<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.050> has<00:00:28.170> a

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
on your belt as you see it come it has a

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.839 
on your belt as you see it come it has a
belt<00:00:28.500> loop<00:00:28.680> on<00:00:28.920> there<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.279> clip<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:29.760> you

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
belt loop on there and a clip so you

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.490 
belt loop on there and a clip so you
could<00:00:30.029> hang<00:00:30.210> clip<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.689> on<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.929> things<00:00:31.170> but

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
could hang clip it on to things but

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.069 
could hang clip it on to things but
assume<00:00:32.399> that's<00:00:32.610> mainly<00:00:32.820> for<00:00:32.969> belts<00:00:33.420> but<00:00:33.930> you

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
assume that's mainly for belts but you

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.290 
assume that's mainly for belts but you
could<00:00:34.260> clip<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.710> other<00:00:34.800> things<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.460> it

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
could clip it to other things and it

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.940 
could clip it to other things and it
obviously<00:00:36.540> has<00:00:36.690> some<00:00:37.140> sort<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.380> slot<00:00:37.649> there<00:00:37.860> so

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
obviously has some sort of slot there so

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.170 
obviously has some sort of slot there so
you<00:00:38.040> can<00:00:38.129> hang<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.370> on<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.460> nail<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.879> your<00:00:38.910> shed

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
you can hang it on a nail in your shed

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.229 
you can hang it on a nail in your shed
or<00:00:39.329> something<00:00:39.719> like<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.820> it<00:00:41.820> has<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.969> great

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
or something like that it has a great

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.479 
or something like that it has a great
Moloch<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:42.809> mechanism<00:00:43.379> as<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.980> can<00:00:44.129> see<00:00:44.340> you

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
Moloch in mechanism as you can see you

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.600 
Moloch in mechanism as you can see you
have<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.730> give<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> little<00:00:45.180> tug<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.170> actually

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
have to give it a little tug to actually

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.180 
have to give it a little tug to actually
release<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.640> from<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.300> sheath<00:00:48.860> so<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:50.070> not

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
release it from the sheath so it's not

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.430 
release it from the sheath so it's not
gonna<00:00:50.370> just<00:00:50.640> drop<00:00:51.090> out<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.510> fall<00:00:51.719> out<00:00:51.960> you

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
gonna just drop out and fall out you

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.560 
gonna just drop out and fall out you
have<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.190> actually<00:00:53.370> give<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.850> little<00:00:53.969> tug<00:00:54.270> to

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
have to actually give it a little tug to

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.619 
have to actually give it a little tug to
release<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.910> so<00:00:56.910> it's<00:00:57.000> not<00:00:57.090> going<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.300> fall<00:00:57.420> out

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
release it so it's not going to fall out

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.569 
release it so it's not going to fall out
and<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.930> totally<00:00:58.289> secure<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.219> side<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.489> the

and I totally secure in the side of the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.970 
and I totally secure in the side of the
sheath<00:00:59.820> which<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.480> really<00:01:00.750> great<00:01:00.930> on<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
sheath which is really great on the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.950 
sheath which is really great on the
knife<00:01:02.160> itself<00:01:04.400> as<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.460> can<00:01:05.519> see<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
knife itself as you can see this is the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.210 
knife itself as you can see this is the
knife<00:01:07.710> itself<00:01:08.240> now<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.270> steel<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.590> Swedish

knife itself now the steel is Swedish
cold<00:01:11.549> rolled<00:01:11.970> stainless<00:01:12.479> steel<00:01:12.810> as<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.320> can

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
cold rolled stainless steel as you can

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.230 
cold rolled stainless steel as you can
see<00:01:13.590> it's<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.890> stainless<00:01:14.310> steel<00:01:14.580> on<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.939> made<00:01:15.090> in

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
see it's a stainless steel on it made in

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.469 
see it's a stainless steel on it made in
Sweden<00:01:16.130> probably<00:01:17.130> one<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.430> best<00:01:17.580> Swedish

the<00:01:25.950> blade<00:01:26.400> thickness<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:28.340> 2.5<00:01:29.340> millimeter

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
the blade thickness is 2.5 millimeter

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.969 
the blade thickness is 2.5 millimeter

and the blade length overall from there
to<00:01:35.100> there<00:01:35.280> that's<00:01:35.810> 104<00:01:36.810> millimeter<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.799> that's

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
to there that's 104 millimeter so that's

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.690 
to there that's 104 millimeter so that's
ten<00:01:39.030> point<00:01:39.450> four<00:01:39.570> centimeters<00:01:40.700> centimeter
