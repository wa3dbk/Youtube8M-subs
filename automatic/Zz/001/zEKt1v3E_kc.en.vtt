00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
the second channel is the top boost

the second channel is the top boost
channel<00:02:02.050> which<00:02:02.170> has<00:02:02.200> also<00:02:02.680> a<00:02:02.890> high<00:02:03.190> and<00:02:03.520> a<00:02:03.580> low

the hots which really increases the

the hots which really increases the

channel<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.010> cool<00:02:12.220> switch<00:02:12.520> makes<00:02:12.940> it<00:02:13.120> sound<00:02:13.300> a
