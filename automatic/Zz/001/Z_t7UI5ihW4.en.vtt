 around and on the back side as 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.170
 the iphone 5 is very light it would be 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.450
 practice to have a shell too 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.340
 lightly and well this is the case of this one 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.270

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.670
 same thing for switching to mode 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.110

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.960
 ultimate for iphone 5 we find the 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.399
