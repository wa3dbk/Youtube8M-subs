right now we got a lot of addresses here
we<00:01:17.310> can<00:01:17.580> actually<00:01:18.540> just<00:01:18.950> zoom<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.130> as<00:01:20.340> far<00:01:21.150> as

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
we can actually just zoom in as far as

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.190 
we can actually just zoom in as far as
you<00:01:21.420> can<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.869> make<00:01:22.409> sure<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:23.280> say<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.450> the

and we'll do it the easy way
we<00:01:42.600> scroll<00:01:42.899> around<00:01:43.259> until<00:01:43.740> we<00:01:43.770> see<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.490> static

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
we scroll around until we see the static

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.429 
we scroll around until we see the static
addresses<00:01:45.470> we<00:01:47.390> just<00:01:48.390> drag<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.780> drop<00:01:48.960> them<00:01:49.140> in

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
addresses we just drag and drop them in

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.429 
addresses we just drag and drop them in
here<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:51.299> first<00:01:51.509> one<00:01:51.570> looks<00:01:51.810> good<00:01:52.110> we

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
here and the first one looks good we

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.870 
here and the first one looks good we
change<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:53.220> value<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:54.439> 2000<00:01:55.549> now<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.729> we

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
change this value to 2000 now that we

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.179 
change this value to 2000 now that we
are<00:01:56.969> in<00:01:57.090> game<00:01:57.270> we<00:01:57.509> zoom<00:01:57.719> in<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.049> out<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.409> as<00:01:58.829> we

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
are in game we zoom in and out and as we

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.440 
are in game we zoom in and out and as we
can<00:01:59.310> see<00:01:59.630> this<00:02:00.630> was<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.020> correct<00:02:01.320> address<00:02:02.450> so

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
can see this was the correct address so

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.469 
can see this was the correct address so
we<00:02:03.540> can<00:02:03.719> delete<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.140> others<00:02:04.409> other<00:02:05.280> ones

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
we can delete the others other ones

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.949 
we can delete the others other ones
and<00:02:07.670> okay<00:02:08.670> yeah<00:02:09.050> so<00:02:10.050> this<00:02:10.259> address<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:11.959> yeah

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
and okay yeah so this address is yeah

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.930 
and okay yeah so this address is yeah
most<00:02:13.410> important<00:02:13.920> for<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.160> this<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.550> what<00:02:14.580> you

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
most important for you this is what you

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.160 
most important for you this is what you
enter<00:02:15.300> in<00:02:15.599> your<00:02:15.680> dota<00:02:16.680> 2<00:02:16.950> camera<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:19.140> can

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
enter in your dota 2 camera and you can

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.970 
enter in your dota 2 camera and you can
also<00:02:19.680> see<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.580> offset<00:02:21.450> for<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:22.019> there<00:02:22.410> we<00:02:22.590> go

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
also see the offset for that there we go

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.490 
also see the offset for that there we go
let's<00:02:23.489> see<00:02:23.880> client<00:02:24.300> DLL<00:02:24.630> plus<00:02:25.790> address<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.500> it

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
let's see client DLL plus address and it

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.630 
let's see client DLL plus address and it
ends<00:02:29.130> up<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.459> this<00:02:29.790> one<00:02:30.380> so<00:02:31.380> either<00:02:31.769> way<00:02:32.250> it's

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
ends up and this one so either way it's

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.940 
ends up and this one so either way it's
working<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.360> guess<00:02:34.430> what<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.459> an<00:02:35.700> encoded<00:02:36.150> but

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
working I guess what you an encoded but

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.550 
working I guess what you an encoded but
this<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.190> how<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:38.760> can<00:02:39.209> find<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.690> address<00:02:39.930> or

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
this is how you can find the address or

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.910 
this is how you can find the address or
the<00:02:40.980> offset<00:02:41.690> simply<00:02:42.690> get<00:02:42.930> in<00:02:42.959> a<00:02:43.140> game<00:02:43.290> start<00:02:43.830> a

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920
