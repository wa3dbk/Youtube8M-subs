00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.570 
let's get down to business this Mara
here<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.609> monster<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.859> until<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:20.070> saw<00:00:20.369> that

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
here is a monster and until I saw that

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.820 
here is a monster and until I saw that
he's<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:21.180> right-wing<00:00:21.869> go<00:00:22.050> now<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.710> is

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
he's a right-wing go now that is

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.070 
he's a right-wing go now that is
really<00:00:23.130> disappointing<00:00:23.490> because<00:00:24.000> he<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:24.900> not

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
really disappointing because he is not

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.470 
really disappointing because he is not
left<00:00:25.350> for<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.650> as<00:00:25.800> well<00:00:26.010> but<00:00:26.670> obviously<00:00:26.880> you

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
left for it as well but obviously you

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.740 
left for it as well but obviously you
can<00:00:27.720> take<00:00:27.990> advantage<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.740> his<00:00:29.160> new<00:00:30.090> post<00:00:30.390> shots

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
can take advantage of his new post shots

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.990 
can take advantage of his new post shots
because<00:00:30.990> he<00:00:31.230> has<00:00:31.410> some<00:00:31.710> disgusting<00:00:32.669> short

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
because he has some disgusting short

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.110 
because he has some disgusting short
power<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.260> high<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.309> wouldn't<00:00:35.730> it

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
power it is so high that you wouldn't it

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.780 
power it is so high that you wouldn't it
seems<00:00:36.480> as<00:00:36.750> if<00:00:36.780> it's<00:00:37.230> as<00:00:37.410> as<00:00:37.829> powerful<00:00:38.670> as

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
seems as if it's as as powerful as

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.330 
seems as if it's as as powerful as
Podolski<00:00:39.570> seriously<00:00:40.170> his<00:00:40.290> shot<00:00:40.559> power<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:41.010> so

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
Podolski seriously his shot power is so

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.540 
Podolski seriously his shot power is so
awesome<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.360> he<00:00:43.110> has<00:00:43.440> really<00:00:44.040> good<00:00:44.340> long

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
awesome and he has really good long

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.190 
awesome and he has really good long
shots<00:00:44.850> which<00:00:45.059> makes<00:00:45.329> him<00:00:45.480> even<00:00:45.809> more<00:00:45.840> awesome

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
shots which makes him even more awesome

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.529 
shots which makes him even more awesome
and<00:00:46.649> makes<00:00:47.160> him<00:00:47.309> even<00:00:47.640> more<00:00:47.879> terrible<00:00:48.300> in

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
and makes him even more terrible in

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.060 
and makes him even more terrible in
right<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.140> right<00:00:49.320> winger<00:00:49.530> position

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
right in the right winger position

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.369 
right in the right winger position
because<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.760> can't<00:00:51.030> take<00:00:51.300> advantage<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:52.170> that

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
because you can't take advantage of that

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.709 
because you can't take advantage of that
unless<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.160> change<00:00:53.489> him<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> left<00:00:54.420> forward

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
unless you change him to a left forward

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.849 
unless you change him to a left forward
or<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.699> striker<00:00:56.750> obviously<00:00:57.750> his<00:00:58.140> price<00:00:58.559> is

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
or a striker obviously his price is

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.670 
or a striker obviously his price is
gonna<00:00:59.309> be<00:00:59.520> decent<00:01:00.180> because<00:01:00.570> he's<00:01:01.530> not

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
gonna be decent because he's not

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.650 
gonna be decent because he's not
overpriced<00:01:02.280> because<00:01:02.460> his<00:01:02.879> position<00:01:03.359> change

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
overpriced because his position change

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.289 
overpriced because his position change
if<00:01:04.559> he<00:01:04.589> was<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> striker<00:01:05.309> he<00:01:05.580> would<00:01:05.760> be<00:01:06.030> much

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
if he was a striker he would be much

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.359 
if he was a striker he would be much
more<00:01:06.570> expensive<00:01:06.810> but<00:01:07.710> since<00:01:07.950> he's<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.220> right

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
more expensive but since he's the right

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:08.750 
more expensive but since he's the right
winger

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
winger

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.390 
winger
I<00:01:08.909> bought<00:01:09.360> him<00:01:09.479> for<00:01:09.630> 250k<00:01:10.290> been<00:01:10.650> within<00:01:10.979> 20

minutes<00:01:11.700> when<00:01:11.939> he<00:01:12.030> was<00:01:12.180> released<00:01:12.600> which<00:01:13.020> is

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
minutes when he was released which is

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.390 
minutes when he was released which is
really<00:01:13.470> good<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.770> don't<00:01:13.950> care<00:01:14.100> if<00:01:14.159> I'm<00:01:14.280> gonna

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
lose money

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.590

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
because I'm keeping him but right winger

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.450 
because I'm keeping him but right winger
it<00:01:18.750> makes<00:01:18.930> him<00:01:19.080> go<00:01:19.290> down<00:01:19.500> which<00:01:19.830> means<00:01:20.100> you
