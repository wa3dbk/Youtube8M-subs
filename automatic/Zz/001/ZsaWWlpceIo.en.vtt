recipe would have the sugar cane on each
of<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.840> sides<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.649> ingot<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.100> you're

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
of the sides and the ingot that you're

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.160

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
trying to get in the middle now the top

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.840 
trying to get in the middle now the top
and<00:00:52.350> bottom<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.829> ingot<00:00:53.100> its<00:00:53.280> dependent<00:00:53.789> on

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
and bottom of the ingot its dependent on

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.939 
and bottom of the ingot its dependent on
where<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.239> course<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.809> grown<00:00:55.110> which<00:00:55.649> iron

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
where of course it is grown which iron

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.220 
where of course it is grown which iron
ore<00:00:56.370> would<00:00:56.820> be<00:00:57.059> found<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.510> overworld<00:00:57.960> so

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
ore would be found in the overworld so

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.979 
ore would be found in the overworld so
we'd<00:00:58.379> use<00:00:58.410> smooth<00:00:58.949> stone<00:00:59.340> but<00:00:59.879> however<00:01:00.059> quartz

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
we'd use smooth stone but however quartz

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.689 
we'd use smooth stone but however quartz
is<00:01:01.170> not<00:01:01.379> found<00:01:01.680> in<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.949> overworld<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.520> must

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
is not found in the overworld you must

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.090 
is not found in the overworld you must
go<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.239> deadly<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.780> evil<00:01:04.080> nether<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.920> what

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
go to the deadly and evil nether so what

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.289 
go to the deadly and evil nether so what
you're<00:01:05.220> gonna<00:01:05.280> need<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.580> put<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.119> top<00:01:06.270> and

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
you're gonna need to put on the top and

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.210 
you're gonna need to put on the top and
bottom<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.170> netherrack<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.130> then

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
bottom of that is netherrack and then

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.679 
bottom of that is netherrack and then
you'll<00:01:08.310> have<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.610> quartz<00:01:08.880> crystal<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
you'll have the quartz crystal in the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.929 
you'll have the quartz crystal in the
middle<00:01:09.990> now<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.650> globe<00:01:11.130> stone<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.729> one

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
middle now the globe stone is the one

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.850 
middle now the globe stone is the one
specialty<00:01:12.450> case<00:01:12.780> because<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.530> only<00:01:13.619> one

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
specialty case because it's the only one

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.890 
specialty case because it's the only one
that<00:01:14.040> has<00:01:14.159> glowstone<00:01:14.760> on<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.420> tops<00:01:15.630> and

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
that has glowstone on the tops and

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.749 
that has glowstone on the tops and
bottoms<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.619> now<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.860> course<00:01:16.920> that's<00:01:17.490> just

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
bottoms and now of course that's just

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.520 
bottoms and now of course that's just
because<00:01:17.909> glowstone<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.689> selfish<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.229> doesn't

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
because glowstone is selfish and doesn't

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.230 
because glowstone is selfish and doesn't
like<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.770> share<00:01:20.009> with<00:01:20.159> crafting<00:01:20.549> recipes<00:01:21.000> but

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240
