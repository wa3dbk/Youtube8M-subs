two days later we have a nice yeast
mixture<00:02:05.750> here<00:02:06.110> we<00:02:06.830> could<00:02:07.040> use<00:02:07.250> this<00:02:07.460> and<00:02:07.730> pour

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
mixture here we could use this and pour

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.330 
mixture here we could use this and pour
it<00:02:08.030> directly<00:02:08.180> into<00:02:08.660> our<00:02:09.200> brewing<00:02:09.410> day<00:02:09.710> what

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
it directly into our brewing day what

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.670 
it directly into our brewing day what
we're<00:02:10.460> going<00:02:10.670> to<00:02:10.760> do<00:02:10.910> is<00:02:11.060> chill<00:02:11.390> this<00:02:11.630> and<00:02:11.960> then

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
we're going to do is chill this and then

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.470 
we're going to do is chill this and then
create<00:02:13.070> a<00:02:13.100> little<00:02:13.370> bit<00:02:13.490> more<00:02:13.730> work<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.390> do

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
create a little bit more work to do

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.570 
create a little bit more work to do
what's<00:02:14.660> called<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:14.930> step-up<00:02:15.350> starter<00:02:15.890> so<00:02:16.460> we

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
what's called a step-up starter so we

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.010 
what's called a step-up starter so we
will<00:02:16.670> make<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.820> larger<00:02:17.270> starter<00:02:17.630> with<00:02:17.780> more

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
will make a larger starter with more

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.100 
will make a larger starter with more
yeast<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.680> use<00:02:18.830> on<00:02:19.010> brewing<00:02:19.310> day<00:02:23.110> after

yeast to use on brewing day after
chilling<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.680> yeast<00:02:24.860> has<00:02:25.040> settled<00:02:25.400> up<00:02:25.520> nicely

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
chilling the yeast has settled up nicely

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.580 
chilling the yeast has settled up nicely
and<00:02:26.120> we<00:02:26.240> are<00:02:26.360> left<00:02:26.570> with<00:02:26.750> brown<00:02:26.990> work<00:02:27.290> on<00:02:27.500> the

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
and we are left with brown work on the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.670 
and we are left with brown work on the
top<00:02:27.830> now<00:02:28.610> we<00:02:28.670> will<00:02:28.910> decant<00:02:29.360> or<00:02:29.690> pour<00:02:29.990> off<00:02:30.200> the

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
top now we will decant or pour off the

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.310 
top now we will decant or pour off the
brown<00:02:30.920> wort<00:02:31.250> from<00:02:31.520> the<00:02:31.850> top<00:02:32.090> leaving<00:02:32.930> as<00:02:33.170> much

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
brown wort from the top leaving as much

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.960 
brown wort from the top leaving as much
of<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.560> yeast<00:02:33.830> and<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.130> bottom<00:02:34.460> as<00:02:34.610> we<00:02:34.730> can

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
of the yeast and the bottom as we can

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.300 
of the yeast and the bottom as we can
and<00:02:35.210> then<00:02:35.780> swirl<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.350> east<00:02:36.530> up<00:02:36.770> to<00:02:37.010> bring<00:02:37.190> it

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
and then swirl the east up to bring it

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:47.300 
and then swirl the east up to bring it
all<00:02:37.400> back<00:02:37.430> up<00:02:37.820> into<00:02:38.000> suspension

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.400 

you

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.160 

now<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.100> step<00:02:51.400> up<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.760> yeast<00:02:52.000> in<00:02:52.330> there<00:02:52.600> we

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
now to step up the yeast in there we

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.080 
now to step up the yeast in there we
will<00:02:53.320> add<00:02:53.500> another<00:02:53.670> 1215<00:02:54.670> milliliters<00:02:55.060> of

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
will add another 1215 milliliters of

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.940 
will add another 1215 milliliters of
work<00:02:55.420> that<00:02:55.900> we<00:02:56.050> have<00:02:56.230> already<00:02:56.410> made<00:02:56.740> and

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
work that we have already made and

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.880 
work that we have already made and
shelled<00:02:57.160> to<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.460> proper<00:02:57.790> temperature<00:02:58.890> this

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
shelled to the proper temperature this

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.770 
shelled to the proper temperature this
will<00:02:59.950> be<00:03:00.190> poured<00:03:00.520> into<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:00.970> Erlenmeyer<00:03:01.270> flask

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
will be poured into the Erlenmeyer flask

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.590 
will be poured into the Erlenmeyer flask
on<00:03:02.080> top<00:03:02.320> of<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:03.430> thick<00:03:03.670> east<00:03:03.940> slurry<00:03:04.300> that<00:03:04.510> is

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
on top of the thick east slurry that is

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:12.949 
on top of the thick east slurry that is
in<00:03:04.720> there<00:03:04.900> now

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.559 

so<00:03:13.560> now<00:03:13.709> we'll<00:03:13.890> have<00:03:13.920> about<00:03:14.189> 1600<00:03:14.760> millilitres

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
so now we'll have about 1600 millilitres

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.839 
so now we'll have about 1600 millilitres
of<00:03:15.659> work<00:03:15.989> that<00:03:16.829> we<00:03:17.010> will<00:03:17.189> take<00:03:17.400> down<00:03:17.579> to<00:03:17.760> our

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
of work that we will take down to our

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.420 
of work that we will take down to our
stir<00:03:18.060> plate<00:03:18.359> and<00:03:18.659> let<00:03:19.590> ferment<00:03:19.950> for<00:03:20.099> a<00:03:20.159> couple

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
stir plate and let ferment for a couple

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.490 
stir plate and let ferment for a couple
days<00:03:20.579> to<00:03:21.060> give<00:03:21.209> us<00:03:21.299> a<00:03:21.390> nice<00:03:21.540> big<00:03:21.599> healthy<00:03:22.290> yeast

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
days to give us a nice big healthy yeast

days to give us a nice big healthy yeast
cell<00:03:22.739> count<00:03:25.760> bring<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.879> flask<00:03:27.180> back

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
cell count bring the flask back

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.339 
cell count bring the flask back
downstairs<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.680> our<00:03:28.859> stir<00:03:29.549> plate<00:03:30.349> while

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
downstairs to our stir plate while

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.589 
downstairs to our stir plate while
putting<00:03:31.590> it<00:03:31.739> on<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.099> stir<00:03:32.310> plate<00:03:32.609> we<00:03:33.180> move<00:03:33.480> it

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
putting it on the stir plate we move it

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.149 
putting it on the stir plate we move it
around<00:03:33.689> just<00:03:34.049> a<00:03:34.200> little<00:03:34.230> bit<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.769> make<00:03:34.980> sure

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 
around just a little bit to make sure

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:38.059 
around just a little bit to make sure
that<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.489> stir<00:03:35.790> bar<00:03:35.819> inside<00:03:36.689> gets<00:03:37.590> caught<00:03:37.889> by

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
that the stir bar inside gets caught by

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.670 
that the stir bar inside gets caught by
the<00:03:38.099> magnet<00:03:38.549> on<00:03:38.609> the<00:03:38.670> stir<00:03:38.939> plate<00:03:39.209> and<00:03:39.540> then<00:03:40.469> we

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
the magnet on the stir plate and then we

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.610 
the magnet on the stir plate and then we
activate<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.730> stir<00:03:41.939> plate<00:03:42.239> and<00:03:42.540> gently<00:03:43.379> turn

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
activate the stir plate and gently turn

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.589 
activate the stir plate and gently turn
it<00:03:43.769> up<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.430> cruise<00:03:44.760> through<00:03:44.790> this<00:03:45.000> a<00:03:45.150> vortex

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
it up to cruise through this a vortex

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.300 
it up to cruise through this a vortex
like<00:03:46.019> we<00:03:46.200> had<00:03:46.349> last<00:03:46.530> time<00:03:47.209> we<00:03:48.209> let<00:03:48.419> this

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
like we had last time we let this

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.460 
like we had last time we let this
ferment<00:03:50.310> for<00:03:50.849> a<00:03:50.909> couple<00:03:51.180> of<00:03:51.239> days<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:51.810> we'll

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
ferment for a couple of days and we'll

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.640 
ferment for a couple of days and we'll
have<00:03:53.010> a<00:03:53.040> nice<00:03:53.280> big<00:03:54.000> yeast<00:03:54.480> cell<00:03:54.750> count<00:03:55.019> to<00:03:55.439> put

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
have a nice big yeast cell count to put

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:03.950 
have a nice big yeast cell count to put
into<00:03:55.769> our<00:03:55.889> beer

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.199 

you

and<00:04:07.750> here's<00:04:08.170> the<00:04:08.379> starter<00:04:08.769> with<00:04:08.920> a<00:04:08.950> nice<00:04:09.159> thick

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:09.189 
and here's the starter with a nice thick

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:12.750 
and here's the starter with a nice thick
layer<00:04:09.640> of<00:04:09.730> crafting<00:04:10.269> on<00:04:10.390> top<00:04:11.280> this<00:04:12.280> is<00:04:12.430> after<00:04:12.730> a

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
layer of crafting on top this is after a

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.089 
layer of crafting on top this is after a
couple<00:04:12.969> more<00:04:13.180> days<00:04:13.390> of<00:04:13.569> fermenting<00:04:14.099> we'll

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
couple more days of fermenting we'll

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:16.949 
couple more days of fermenting we'll
take<00:04:15.340> this<00:04:15.579> whole<00:04:15.819> thing<00:04:15.849> now<00:04:16.299> and<00:04:16.539> chill<00:04:16.780> it

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
take this whole thing now and chill it

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.810 
take this whole thing now and chill it
until<00:04:17.590> at<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:17.709> end<00:04:17.889> of<00:04:18.009> brew<00:04:18.190> day<00:04:18.400> we'll<00:04:18.609> pitch

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
until at the end of brew day we'll pitch

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.460 
until at the end of brew day we'll pitch
it<00:04:18.970> into<00:04:19.150> our<00:04:19.239> beer<00:04:21.690> so<00:04:22.690> at<00:04:22.930> the<00:04:23.020> beginning<00:04:23.139> of

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
it into our beer so at the beginning of

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.740 
it into our beer so at the beginning of
brewing<00:04:23.770> day<00:04:23.979> we<00:04:24.610> take<00:04:24.789> the<00:04:24.940> starter<00:04:25.300> out<00:04:25.330> and

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
brewing day we take the starter out and

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.650 
brewing day we take the starter out and
decant<00:04:26.710> off<00:04:26.889> the<00:04:27.100> liquid<00:04:27.430> again<00:04:27.669> you<00:04:28.210> can<00:04:28.479> just

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
decant off the liquid again you can just

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.840 
decant off the liquid again you can just
pour<00:04:28.930> it<00:04:29.020> all<00:04:29.110> in<00:04:29.530> liquid<00:04:30.130> and<00:04:30.280> everything<00:04:30.699> I

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
pour it all in liquid and everything I

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.610 
pour it all in liquid and everything I
prefer<00:04:31.240> to<00:04:31.389> decant<00:04:31.750> that's<00:04:32.139> a<00:04:32.229> personal

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
prefer to decant that's a personal

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.770 
prefer to decant that's a personal
choice<00:04:32.800> and<00:04:33.130> I<00:04:33.940> do<00:04:34.000> this<00:04:34.150> at<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.360> beginning<00:04:34.720> of

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
choice and I do this at the beginning of

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.719 
choice and I do this at the beginning of
brewing<00:04:35.139> day<00:04:35.380> so<00:04:35.979> it<00:04:36.100> gives<00:04:36.280> the<00:04:36.430> yeast<00:04:36.610> slurry

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
brewing day so it gives the yeast slurry

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:38.550 
brewing day so it gives the yeast slurry
a<00:04:36.940> chance<00:04:37.210> to<00:04:37.360> warm<00:04:37.570> up<00:04:37.750> before<00:04:37.930> pitching<00:04:38.320> it

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
a chance to warm up before pitching it

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.230 
a chance to warm up before pitching it
into<00:04:38.770> the<00:04:38.860> work<00:04:39.039> that<00:04:39.070> we<00:04:39.280> make<00:04:39.610> that's<00:04:40.030> going

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
into the work that we make that's going

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:48.220 
into the work that we make that's going
to<00:04:40.300> become<00:04:40.599> the<00:04:40.720> beer

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.200 

so<00:04:49.230> with<00:04:49.410> brood<00:04:49.650> a<00:04:49.830> near-complete<00:04:50.310> the<00:04:50.970> word

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
so with brood a near-complete the word

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.960 
so with brood a near-complete the word
is<00:04:51.389> all<00:04:51.540> in<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:51.930> fermentor<00:04:52.470> we<00:04:53.340> mix<00:04:53.790> up<00:04:53.910> the

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
is all in the fermentor we mix up the

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.620 
is all in the fermentor we mix up the
yeast<00:04:54.300> slurry<00:04:54.540> from<00:04:54.900> our<00:04:55.080> starter<00:04:55.530> and<00:04:56.630> pour

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
yeast slurry from our starter and pour

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.590 
yeast slurry from our starter and pour
it<00:04:57.750> into<00:04:57.990> the<00:04:58.770> container<00:04:59.210> we<00:05:00.210> don't<00:05:00.389> need<00:05:00.479> to

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
it into the container we don't need to

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.780 
it into the container we don't need to
be<00:05:00.720> too<00:05:00.870> gentle<00:05:01.260> here<00:05:01.470> because<00:05:01.800> you're<00:05:02.580> trying

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
be too gentle here because you're trying

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.740 
be too gentle here because you're trying
to<00:05:02.940> aerate<00:05:03.090> your<00:05:03.270> wort<00:05:03.449> a<00:05:03.690> little<00:05:03.900> bit<00:05:04.020> anyway

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
to aerate your wort a little bit anyway

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.540 
to aerate your wort a little bit anyway
and<00:05:06.750> this<00:05:06.990> will<00:05:07.169> create<00:05:07.770> a<00:05:07.860> nice<00:05:08.010> rigorous

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
and this will create a nice rigorous

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.870 
and this will create a nice rigorous
fermentation<00:05:09.270> for<00:05:09.510> us<00:05:09.690> and<00:05:10.580> when<00:05:11.580> it's<00:05:11.699> done

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
fermentation for us and when it's done

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.600 
fermentation for us and when it's done
fermenting<00:05:12.540> we<00:05:13.290> will<00:05:13.470> then<00:05:13.590> harvest<00:05:14.100> this

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
fermenting we will then harvest this

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.189 
fermenting we will then harvest this
yeast<00:05:14.910> and<00:05:15.770> do<00:05:16.770> the<00:05:16.889> process<00:05:17.280> all<00:05:17.400> over<00:05:17.430> again

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199 
yeast and do the process all over again

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:24.140 
yeast and do the process all over again
and<00:05:19.199> that'll<00:05:19.470> be<00:05:19.590> the<00:05:19.710> next<00:05:19.860> video<00:05:23.090> thank<00:05:24.090> you

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150
