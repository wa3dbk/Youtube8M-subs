00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
unconventional but it works for me and I

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
start out with is either a pair of

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.770 
start out with is either a pair of
scissors<00:00:34.170> or<00:00:34.610> pruning<00:00:35.610> shears<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:36.210> prefer<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
scissors or pruning shears I prefer the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.000 
scissors or pruning shears I prefer the
pruning<00:00:36.989> shears<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.620> have<00:00:37.770> for<00:00:37.950> your

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
pruning shears that you have for your

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.090 
pruning shears that you have for your
garden<00:00:38.399> because<00:00:39.210> they're<00:00:40.140> easy<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.500> hold<00:00:40.680> and

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
garden because they're easy to hold and

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.709 
garden because they're easy to hold and
it<00:00:41.340> just<00:00:41.520> ends<00:00:41.760> up<00:00:41.820> being<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.090> little<00:00:42.149> easier<00:00:42.570> to

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
it just ends up being a little easier to

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.619 
it just ends up being a little easier to
handle<00:00:42.800> so<00:00:43.800> as<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.070> can<00:00:44.219> see<00:00:44.510> there<00:00:45.510> are

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
handle so as you can see there are

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.490 
handle so as you can see there are
little<00:00:45.870> slits<00:00:46.200> here<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.430> pails<00:00:48.500> they're

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
little slits here on the pails they're

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.260 
little slits here on the pails they're
little<00:00:49.739> holes<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.160> are<00:00:50.460> little<00:00:50.700> perforated

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
we're gonna do is to start by cutting

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.170 
we're gonna do is to start by cutting
those<00:00:56.699> slits<00:00:57.090> open<00:01:01.670> they're<00:01:02.670> really<00:01:02.910> easy<00:01:03.059> to

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
they're all cut the next step is to take

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.600 
they're all cut the next step is to take
a<00:01:12.900> normal<00:01:13.140> bottle<00:01:13.439> opener<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.340> use<00:01:14.460> for

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610

any kind of bottles just take the flat
end<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.430> pry<00:01:17.790> underneath<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.840> lid<00:01:19.189> this

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
end and pry underneath the lid this

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.340 
end and pry underneath the lid this
should<00:01:20.369> be<00:01:20.490> pretty<00:01:20.640> easy<00:01:20.820> from<00:01:21.270> there<00:01:21.479> on<00:01:21.689> as

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
should be pretty easy from there on as

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.830 
should be pretty easy from there on as
long<00:01:22.560> as<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.890> loosen<00:01:23.880> up<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.240> airtight<00:01:24.600> seal
