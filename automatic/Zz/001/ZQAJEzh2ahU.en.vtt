00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.590
 and hello can not wait for koumassi 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.449
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.829
 new tutorial so who will you 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.910
 explain how to install 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.680
 applications that are normally 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.859
 pay on the app store for free 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:36.110
 on your iphone on your ipad and on 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.699
 your ipod touch jailbroken or not then 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.960
 it works with a sign stage so 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:42.420
 the little red application shows in 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.079
 bottom right and for these you will have to 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.899
 so enter your udid on the udid website 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.760
 register hishon dot com then it takes 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.980
 know that it pays 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.800
 then it pays you have here the 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.239
 price so you have basic to 4 dollars 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.280
 99 that I have not tested 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.280
 so I can not tell you yet and 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.030
 the premium at $ 7 99 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.990
 it works perfectly well so I 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.390
 advise you immediately to buy 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.950
 the premium so you do all because 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.539
 to pay you by paypal etc 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.369
 so that I will not show you 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:17.789
 know how to do it once it's 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.800
 do you will receive an email with 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:22.490
 your account info 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.659
 finally you install a spa sign 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.220
 so a passing that's like 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.820
 this then you go for example in 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.420
 your documents 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.369
 you have here all the applications that 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.340
 are passed on install sign that is seen 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.509
 at the logo who are the feet here and on 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.090
 the application that you download this 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.350
 fart friend with the itunes logo once 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.579
 you've spent on signs installed 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.500
 it goes into this with this icon there 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.189
 so I show you for example an internship 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.079
 in the walking dead that I already did 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.930
 here you click on install 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.060
 singh his load then no longer the file 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.090
 heavy plus it lasts a long time necessarily 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.350
 watch here walking dead with the episode 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.119
 from 1 to 4 there is for 1,919 figo so 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.760
 you have to count twenty good 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.420
 minutes after that depends on your 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.390
 computer 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.489
 so that's good it's not a concern so a 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.010
 once it's done you have the insta 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.799
 sign with the logo and you add it 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.690
 on itunes if you add that one that 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.060
 will mark installation failure 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.050
 if you install the application that is 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.280
 passed with a passing 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:35.380
 it will work so I show you 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.480
 itunes there then here is 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.950
 the walking dead so you see he 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.420
 is well installed on my ipad 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.490
 there is no problem so if you do 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.230
 do not believe I would put you a little 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.080
 screen of my ipad so on the app store 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.819
 with the application the walking dead and 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.319
 you will see that I have not bought anything from 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.150
 all but that I can guarantee you 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.470
 then there are other cause like 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.330
 application that I can show you 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:01.690
 For example, there is also 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.260
 to install now so wait 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.560
 look at you on the previous page 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.920
 for example just this one 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.660
 angry birds so that I had it free 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.580
 modern combat 2 4 same I free him 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.830
 on ipad thanks to this manipulation 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.050
 finally, I have a lot of applications 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.620
 cracked on my ipad and it works 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.080
 perfectly 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.400
 so to download the ipo I 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.360
 advise to pic 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.800
 there are almost all applications 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.080
 for example here big theft auto 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.049
 need for speed so you watch 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.799
 quickly for example angry birds 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:41.190
 here are angry birds the links are down 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:44.709
 so I advise you to download 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:47.260
 turbo bits it works great and 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.640
 in addition if you have one of the breakers of 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:55.720
 links that's such that hall of the flanges 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:58.299
 so then shows up my computer that the 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.400
 cake that's normal we see you 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.910
 copy paste the link or actually launched the 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.299
 unclamp 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:10.570
 and here you click on the link and that 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.829
 download here no problem at this 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.630
 level there frankly it works 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:16.120
 perfectly 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.459
 if you have questions of concern or 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.660
 other do not hesitate to put them in 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.430
