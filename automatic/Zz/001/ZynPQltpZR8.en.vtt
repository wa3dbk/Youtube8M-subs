district<00:01:38.549> or<00:01:38.700> something<00:01:38.970> like<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.090> but<00:01:39.420> all

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
district or something like that but all

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.649 
district or something like that but all
around<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.140> city<00:01:40.290> there<00:01:41.009> are<00:01:41.329> walls<00:01:42.329> and
