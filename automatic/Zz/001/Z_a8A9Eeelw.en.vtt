00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:16.280
 only youtube followers of my channel 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:20.510
 next to the gamer tuto and good what we're going 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:25.010
 to do today is to download the sims 4 is 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:28.970
 a new game of law to test a 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:31.039
 simulator of life but of life 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.300
 real 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:39.769
 it's a game that apparently when playing it you 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:43.610
 catches in a good way like now 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:48.019
 we know down there in the windows you see 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:52.760
 I already was playing accommodated my 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:55.879
 microphone is foolish foolish to have 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.210
 I think now overcomes me hear a little 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.640
 stronger good as it says and I've 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.879
 I've been playing, I can not stop playing 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:09.310
 in fact with this tutorial 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.310
 tutorial that I'm forgetting to talk about 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:17.420
 I will enter in 5 hours of more games 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.810
 to see if I get the achievement of 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:25.439
 fond of sims but let's go to 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.810
 grain this error is pissing me off let's go 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.770
 to see the first thing we have to do 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.490
 go to the description of the video and take 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.799
 link to download obviously the link 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.100
 first you will go to an advertisement for 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:45.960
 cut the link because it really is super 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:50.149
 heavy copy this link wrong so that 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.640
 spend what happened here I'm nothing nothing and 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.440
 good 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.040
 obviously put that long link 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:02.220
 the description is an invention then I 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.350
 I cut it for that now we're going to 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.470
 download torrent 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.110
 obviously we need the tower uh 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.989
 otherwise we can not download it to 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.310
 unless we have a program that 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:20.230
 work with good torrent files a 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.959
 once downloaded the torrent 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.819
 we must know where we downloaded it and 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.819
 select them to download 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:37.310
 obviously and obviously 332 times good 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.800
 unless you think about downloading because 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.190
 I downloaded and you are going to 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.890
 start downloading from 0% to 100% 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.910
 If you want to download it in 0 days, I'll 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:53.180
 I recommend internet 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:57.410
 68 megabytes per second mine is not 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:00.800
 so fast is 20 megabytes of that 20 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:04.360
 average of 2 megabytes but it is 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:09.680
 unlimited that is not consuming 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:13.160
 internet megas is not step payment is 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.620
 free but good 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.900
 once downloaded we go to the 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.960
 download folder where we put it to 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.240
 download in my case is the folder of 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:28.010
 download and we have several files 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:31.940
 the same or they are all called rld and 64 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:35.600
 then we are going to give extract here and we 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:39.500
 will extract this file is not an end 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.230
 rar is an iso file but I have it 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.820
 become winrar since winrar what 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.140
 I have configured to work 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:50.780
 also with that and well we have it here 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.300
 9 leagues with 200 megabytes 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.100
 Obviously game alone weighs 8 gigs 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.640
 with 79 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.640
 Y 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:05.380
 the remaining giga obviously is for 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.030
 extra content like in my case the 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.260
 update that I want to put of the 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.450
 pools but that would be another tutorial 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:17.239
 well we open the iso file either 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:21.979
 with winrar of heap 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:25.610
 but this one we are going to give it to extract in 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:28.400
 a folder that you think is good 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.039
 as we already know I have already downloaded the 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:35.449
 game what is extracted what is installed is maya 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:39.280
 I already had a practically long life in 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:42.110
 the aged and three times already 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.490
 practically my first without this tare 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:50.410
 will treat grandpa of me 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:53.110
 well let's bring it in the folder and 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.599
 we go to the contents of the folder in my 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:01.090
 case I go to where we are and what is 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:05.050
 the spirit bridges folder in my case 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:10.139
 Yes and here I have the contents of the iso 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.139
 already extracted we are going to give you the sector 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.920
 good 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.490
 let's give him yes he asked us permission let's 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.490
 to see that yes 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:26.650
 let's give it to accept accept 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:34.089
 we turn off the music we are going to give it 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:35.919
 next next and install not what 

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:39.669
 they can close because you will not like dow 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:45.759
 and even running and certainly not what 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:49.209
 I can record since my pc does not run it 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:51.399
 1080 and average graphics but at the time of 

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:54.999
 record or that I put it by the graphics 

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:59.339
 I walk around the floor without lag 

00:05:54.999 --> 00:06:04.260
 so forget you better try and 

00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:06.870
 prevent better prevention than cure good
