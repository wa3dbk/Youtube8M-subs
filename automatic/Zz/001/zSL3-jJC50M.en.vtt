00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 one of our viewers suggested good 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.799
 idea for release and that's what happened 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.970
 when i tried to implement it i 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.970
 Alexey drove 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.480
 all information taken from the store website 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.359
 wella site and it's not advertising just there 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.670
 market prices and detailed specifications 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.789
 for greater accuracy we take we 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.250
 compare bikes of one company let it 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.789
 will be starck as the first to 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.369
 list 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.690
 that is, initially there are only three 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.120
 basic parameters manufacturer model 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.790
 2015 and disc brakes 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.040
 mountain bike well yes fourth 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.730
 mountain bike option so we 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.989
 compare stark chaser disc and stark 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.989
 router hd 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.710
 we see the difference cost let's decide 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.930
 how justified is it 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.610
 This is how it looks detailed 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.550
 characteristic let's cross out 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.380
 identical characteristics and 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.450
 insignificant at the moment what 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.090
 the number of speeds remains 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.040
 type of brake front fork front 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.619
 rear brake front and rear 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.250
 switch and let's all sort out 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.470
 more 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.720
 number of speeds I would actually 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.000
 attributed to insignificant because if you 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.500
 know how to use speeds 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.259
 21 24 or 27 stars 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.960
 makes it easy of course but it's not vital 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.399
 it must be a draw 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.350
 brake mechanics vs hydraulics 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.300
 difficult choice perhaps there will also be 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.330
 draw front fork 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.729
 50 millimeters vs 80 millimeters 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.430
 announced and God knows both 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.470
 spring elastomer in a good way operas 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.289
 as a substitute but if you give the winners 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.860
 points then I give them 80 millimeters 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:06.490
 brakes against tektro everything is obvious 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.360
 from the point of view of the company win tektro 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.840
 front derailleur 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.330
 suntour vs turn that strange 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.400
 switch and no details so 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.740
 that a preference for a tournament is at least 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.500
 famous rear derailleur bad 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.080
 vs acer and the worst switch 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.150
 in the category for beginners and average in 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.030
 the same category choice is obvious 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.310
 and sulfur in the end with a margin of two voices 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.770
 wins stark router hd 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.310
 and if hydraulics is fundamentally for you 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.310
 it is definitely 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.260
 if you want to do normal 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.050
 assembly on the base of a decent frame like 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.350
 call this springs make a chop then 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.510
 stark tea drive itself will be no worse and 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.350
 the answer to the main question is whether 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.930
 overpay 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.080
 if you do with a chop then 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.630
 definitely not and if you want to ride 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.760
 no special worries and problems 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.240
 pretend to race serious hikes 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.000
 then you should overpay it a little 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.370
 would be justified write whether it was useful 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.340
 release and informative is it worth doing 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.410
 something else like that thank you 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.750
 inspected subscribe telling 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.750
 friends put huskies I Alexei buy
