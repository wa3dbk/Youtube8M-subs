00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.559 

I'm<00:02:16.810> impressed

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
I'm impressed

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.860 
I'm impressed
because<00:02:19.319> it's<00:02:19.700> an<00:02:20.700> interactive<00:02:21.239> baby<00:02:21.510> it

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
because it's an interactive baby it

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.720 
because it's an interactive baby it
doubles<00:02:22.230> as<00:02:22.409> a<00:02:22.439> remote<00:02:22.769> controller<00:02:23.219> so<00:02:23.609> it's

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
doubles as a remote controller so it's

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.490 
doubles as a remote controller so it's
like<00:02:23.909> it<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.269> remote<00:02:24.659> controller<00:02:24.989> in<00:02:25.140> disguise

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
like it a remote controller in disguise

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.339 
like it a remote controller in disguise
so<00:02:25.909> you<00:02:26.909> can<00:02:27.090> actually<00:02:27.239> command<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.049> robot

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
so you can actually command the robot

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.990 
so you can actually command the robot
