 a school in the capital involved the students 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.830
 in a project to reuse 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.809

 middle of the Champs Elysees and with all this 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.890
 history is preparing a dish 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.140
 different for the children made a 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.809
 partnership with the faculty of the

 mounted these gardens here that are mobile 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.780
 If the sun leaves here, it goes somewhere else. 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.360
 if it rains too much hides rafa rafa 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.039
 she was telling me that she planted 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.899
 three weeks ago when I had here 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.129
 What's your name? 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:59.190
 plant is what it is if you eat it 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.300
 with a certain effect he saw carla the children 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.489
 harvest and eat here and at home 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.300
 Let's see what else they got ready. 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.300
 here at school 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.620
 different boots with materials 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.180
 unusable and assembled from a 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.220
 very practical way 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.860
 the lowest are made with sheep 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.410
 channels are almost four meters and 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.270
 with capacity for the planting of 300 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.780
 vegetable seedlings 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.500
 The material is fiber cement and costs 117 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.380
 real 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.350
 the sides are protected and points 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.550
 to drain water mounted on wheels 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.920
 It's easy to change places . 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.570
 also in this nice version of casks 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.930
 plastic industry contracts 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.810
 for R $ 50 each 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.150
 the barrel yields two charming hours where 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.880
 you can hang on the rack 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.910
 tools for planting ideas 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.210
 inspire the simple to make 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.070
 reality gardening in schools 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.310
 It all came out of this teacher's head. 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.310
 patau the agronomist marcos vitorino who 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.460
 live thinking in a non-frivolous way 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.810
 to make the city eat healthy and 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.880
 a lower cost 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.270
 Okay, I only work with materials that 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.160
 person watching or watching as he does 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.970
 to go out the next day put together a 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.160
 garden just as a fact of the gardens have 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.080
 wheel rounds out the very common problem 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.450
 in a city ​​with many buildings and 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.120
 blocking the sun and with schools that have 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.730
 A little space I can even take to the garden 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.459
 for the block from here and after school 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.930
 physical education I can is removing 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.930
 it changing places 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.660
 the colorful and transportable gardens 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.450
 were set up in the courtyard of the high school 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.750
 jesus heart in the center of são paulo 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:00.069
 and they're already the boy's chef. 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.140
 stay there trust she's catholic 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.900
 He will pick up where it is very important. 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.300
 because we bring food 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:12.160
 feel something for us how are you 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:15.790
 likes to eat cabbage kale and you do not 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.250
 Do you tomato and who will eat it? 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.230
 everything when we grow 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.150
 the children already go to recognize the 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.920
 Plants marcelo called me to show 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.049
 this here it seems like this 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.840
 marcelo mint 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.819
 but it's not how do you like her name? 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.370
 It was the cds how do I feel 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:38.319
 you smell her you get one with one 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:42.250
 chance at little this premium has 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:44.860
 good smell a delicious né beyond the 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.660
 question by modest we have all 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.579
 interaction with the community 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.450
 with the parents 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:54.459
 change in eating habits and 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.790
 opportunity for that child who does not 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:59.980
 It's very good to learn in class. 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.819
 to develop knowledge because that 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.319
 can bring knowledge with the plate 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:08.680
 doors can also be made in this 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:11.470
 triplex car that reuses boxes of 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.079
 mortar or in supermarket boxes 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.040
 with casters at a cost of less than 30 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.799
 real 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.350
 is against waste because I 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.020
 I'm already thinking about the reuse 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.410
 water all the beds have a sink 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.300
 which helps eliminating the capital water 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.940
 People return to the plus box and 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.729
 reusing all the son felipe de 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:38.590
 six years already knows to reuse the 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:42.630
 water bike in all this anyway without 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.630
 use the water tank 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.700
 the idea is to make them understand 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:51.070
 planting is easy enough to understand 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.590
 that the seedlings need when a 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.630
 plague in the garden they do not turn the plague 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.330
 How the plague will they know? Look at the 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.100
 caterpillar will come a butterfly that 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.390
 another stage will help in updating 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.390
 of the leaves
