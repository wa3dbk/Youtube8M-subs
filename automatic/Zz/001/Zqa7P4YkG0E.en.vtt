00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 we put the mumps on your knees soothe 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.820
 animals and need to pull off like that 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.920
 paw pressed but live instinctively 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.469
 start and it tugs therefore foot 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.870
 We came only need a finger if 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.390
 you push your fingers down 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.109
 you can also fix 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:26.699
 foot animal quietly now pruned 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.830
 as usual the edge of the claw seems to be further 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.410
 you can still cut it 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.390
 scary that you can touch the blood 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.540
 vessel so i'm starting to trim by 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.940
 edges on one side at an angle on the other 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.879
 sides at an angle 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:46.680
 ok still dead claw with one 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:50.430
 sides angled on the other side under 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.890
 the corner still shows that the dead claw is so 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.770
 way obviously you don't cut right away 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.199
 the whole part especially is convenient and so 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.199
 meetings when running big fat 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.049
 claws one more time you can here that corner 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.680
 even to cut it no matter what the dead can 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.689
 mow some more from this side i 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.549
 I take for this usually here tweezers for 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.520
 nails 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:17.189
 which is very convenient everything you can try 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.770
 still need to be very neat and completely by 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.509
 a little bit 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.060
 living on you lies quietly nowhere 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.100
 twitches and you can calmly meetings 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.840
 see how you can tweak 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:35.430
 claw is still slightly on top now is now 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:39.380
 just above the top you can still look 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.400
 because here's another completely white 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.640
 horny part spoiling 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.890
 still trim and more angle 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.590
 it is from this side that I reach 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.780
 a piece this way even if I touch 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.939
 vessel it will not be completely cut 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.750
 vessel and quite from the corner you touch 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.930
 it'll hit him still trim 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.390
 Now you can see that forge already somehow 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.000
 not so white more bodily know what 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.729
 already enough nose claw became 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.229
 normal length 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.920
 shaking up the garbage go to the next 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.920
 claw
