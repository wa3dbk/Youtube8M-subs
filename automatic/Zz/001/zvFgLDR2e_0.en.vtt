00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.650

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:29.670
 there I have the key here O padlock on 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.579
 bike in a card here that I put 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.000
 Do not close the lock here. 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.000
 you will see 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:45.149
 the key here is frost 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:47.910
 Come on it 's very simple what you go 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:53.930
 Do you put this padlock on the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.930
 crown of the motorcycle crown 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.660
 however I put it here on the easel 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:11.030
 to make it easier for you to understand 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:14.070
 Here O coffee got left behind if the 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.290
 individual trying to get off with his bike will 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.759
 break this cover here but at least 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:25.200
 will avoid you 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:27.509
 I lost your motorcycle, why? 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.450
 individual and will not choose your fashion 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.820

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.680
 I hope you liked the video 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:43.200
 is a simple but avoid 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:45.630
 you lose the bike is this business of 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.920
 alarm and I do not trust much because I 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:53.250
 I know I need to stay, I know the 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.270
 car alarm too i think a lot 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.270
 easy to turn off 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.900
 I know a lot, I find it very easy. 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:05.590
 off and the bike is also there then 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:09.310

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.170
