00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.900

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.820
 will not attack bus beauty here to flip us 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.889
 repeat the mcs my makeup alwyn 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.190
 and alex makeup also so 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.050
 left my character will be inspired 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.220
 a lot of the circle's movies makes it the 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.650
 movie I've ever seen but it's the 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:29.460
 little girl then if I'm wrong this 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.380
 we made for women we make up 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.850
 we made you an accelerated video I 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.829
 when you show up right now 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.489
 and you can explain to us that 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.110
 what we did 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.600
 in the first place what is it about 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.920
 an exit yes the first step was 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.420
 ended up covering a little bit 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.290
 your worries with a masking tape just 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.760
 to not damage them 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.920
 because then we came to put some 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.480
 latex that's a little bit loud on the 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.190
 skin so I just took latex 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.719
 liquid like that before meaning 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.800
 so that I do not get the one to 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.719
 the arrival because when they want to get 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.219
 remove make sure it gets you 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.289
 so I came to put a layer of 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.670
 latex a layer of wad again a 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.500
 latex layer as for you come 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.000
 the seals in the bottom then one 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.470
 let it dry although we do not mow so 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.210
 I tend bets in the udder forehead 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.130
 happy without religion to do like 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.040
 wounds of small boils never when 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.750
 even my wii button at these places 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.100
 yes that's just batting and then the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.330
 latex made a little 3d effect 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.759
 impression what we did 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.680

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.990

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.689

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.640

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.219
