these 2 times maximum and they should

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.609 
these 2 times maximum and they should
throw<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.030> away<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.689> could<00:01:12.960> be<00:01:12.990> good<00:01:13.290> at<00:01:13.470> the

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
throw it away so it could be good at the

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.890 
throw it away so it could be good at the
beach<00:01:13.770> if<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.189> aren't<00:01:14.790> home<00:01:15.000> if<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.450> are<00:01:15.659> away

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900

beach if you aren't home if you are away
or<00:01:16.380> something<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.340> we're<00:01:17.549> using<00:01:17.670> one<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:17.939> these

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
or something so we're using one of these

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.890 
or something so we're using one of these
and<00:01:18.560> then<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.920> get<00:01:20.340> four<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.299> these<00:01:21.450> stickers

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
and then you get four of these stickers

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.440 
and then you get four of these stickers
so<00:01:22.650> they<00:01:22.830> say<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.430> should<00:01:23.759> use<00:01:23.880> only<00:01:24.090> one

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.010 
so they say that you should use only one
or<00:01:24.689> two<00:01:25.140> times<00:01:25.530> maximum<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.610> we'll<00:01:27.600> have<00:01:27.780> two

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
or two times maximum so we'll have two

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.690 
or two times maximum so we'll have two
over<00:01:28.380> here<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.799> we<00:01:28.860> can<00:01:29.040> use<00:01:29.159> for<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.460> one

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
over here that we can use for that one

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.140 
over here that we can use for that one
but<00:01:30.600> we'll<00:01:30.780> start<00:01:30.960> off<00:01:31.079> with<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:31.380> one<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:32.280> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
but we'll start off with this one so the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.080

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.270 

let's<00:02:19.370> see<00:02:19.580> this<00:02:20.260> hopefully<00:02:21.260> won't<00:02:21.860> be<00:02:22.040> too

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
let's see this hopefully won't be too

00:02:22.280 --> 00:03:03.440 
let's see this hopefully won't be too
hard<00:02:40.930> there<00:02:41.930> we<00:02:42.049> go
