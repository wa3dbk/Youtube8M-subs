00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.910 

I<00:00:36.000> love<00:00:37.000> the<00:00:37.750> curl<00:00:38.710> pattern<00:00:40.260> I'm<00:00:41.260> waiting<00:00:41.710> to

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
I love the curl pattern I'm waiting to

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.229 
I love the curl pattern I'm waiting to
see<00:00:42.100> you<00:00:42.370> this<00:00:42.820> smell<00:00:43.149> look<00:00:43.300> like<00:00:45.030> all<00:00:46.030> right

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
see you this smell look like all right

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.100 
see you this smell look like all right
so<00:00:46.540> Nina<00:00:46.960> says<00:00:47.739> that<00:00:48.219> you<00:00:49.000> shouldn't<00:00:49.480> pull<00:00:49.930> it

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
so Nina says that you shouldn't pull it

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.880 
so Nina says that you shouldn't pull it
apart<00:00:50.320> too<00:00:50.860> much<00:00:51.129> just<00:00:51.460> maybe<00:00:51.790> in<00:00:52.329> three<00:00:53.320> so

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
apart too much just maybe in three so

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.180 
apart too much just maybe in three so
I'm<00:00:53.949> trying<00:00:54.339> to<00:00:54.460> see<00:00:54.640> how<00:00:54.820> to<00:00:54.879> do<00:00:55.149> this<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.949> my

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
I'm trying to see how to do this is my

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.060 
I'm trying to see how to do this is my
first<00:00:57.489> line<00:00:57.850> without<00:01:01.440> messing<00:01:02.440> with<00:01:02.829> the

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
first line without messing with the

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:33.290 
first line without messing with the
pattern<00:01:03.519> too<00:01:03.760> much<00:01:04.890> all<00:01:05.890> right

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.210 

I'm<00:01:33.900> just<00:01:34.080> trying<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.500> hold<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.980> pieces

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
I'm just trying to hold the pieces

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.000 
I'm just trying to hold the pieces
together<00:01:35.580> as<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.240> separate<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.920> because<00:01:37.920> I

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
together as I separate it because I

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:47.600 
together as I separate it because I
don't<00:01:38.190> want<00:01:38.370> it<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.490> fray<00:01:39.230> and<00:01:40.940> free<00:01:41.940> so

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.760 

I'm<00:01:48.120> just<00:01:48.360> pulling<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.900> apart<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.410> three

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
I'm just pulling it apart in three

00:01:49.770 --> 00:02:31.750 
I'm just pulling it apart in three
sections

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:41.490 

so<00:02:32.330> far<00:02:32.629> so<00:02:32.870> good

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.400 

I'll<00:02:41.890> do<00:02:42.040> that<00:02:42.190> unless<00:02:42.400> this<00:02:42.880> is<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.120> crown

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
I'll do that unless this is the crown

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.350 
I'll do that unless this is the crown
now<00:02:45.950> there's<00:02:46.220> one<00:02:46.340> straight<00:02:46.760> piece<00:02:47.000> I<00:02:47.240> want

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
now there's one straight piece I want

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.510 
now there's one straight piece I want
know<00:02:47.480> what<00:02:47.660> happened<00:02:48.020> to<00:02:48.110> it<00:02:48.140> but<00:02:48.530> i<00:02:48.770> would

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
know what happened to it but i would

00:02:49.520 --> 00:03:04.270 
know what happened to it but i would
have<00:02:49.550> to<00:02:49.670> cover<00:02:49.970> that

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.010 

notice<00:03:05.030> as<00:03:05.270> I<00:03:05.420> separate<00:03:06.020> it<00:03:06.050> I'm<00:03:06.380> just<00:03:07.190> holding

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
notice as I separate it I'm just holding

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:15.240 
notice as I separate it I'm just holding
the<00:03:09.020> whole<00:03:09.260> piece<00:03:09.740> so<00:03:09.980> it<00:03:10.010> doesn't<00:03:10.459> fray

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:39.540 

and<00:03:15.760> just<00:03:16.060> walking<00:03:16.330> it<00:03:16.630> in

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:04:04.630 

oh<00:03:39.610> it's<00:03:40.420> pretty

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.580 

probably<00:04:05.420> not<00:04:05.569> the<00:04:05.720> best<00:04:05.750> way<00:04:06.050> to<00:04:06.200> pull<00:04:06.470> it

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
probably not the best way to pull it

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.800 
probably not the best way to pull it
apart<00:04:06.680> I<00:04:07.190> can't<00:04:07.520> remember<00:04:07.730> how<00:04:08.030> she<00:04:08.090> pulled<00:04:08.450> it

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.570 

all<00:04:11.810> right<00:04:12.020> I'm<00:04:12.230> going<00:04:12.380> to<00:04:12.470> take<00:04:12.560> my<00:04:12.800> comb<00:04:13.100> and

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:33.320 
all right I'm going to take my comb and
try<00:04:13.850> to<00:04:13.930> cover<00:04:14.930> my<00:04:15.230> parts

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.040
