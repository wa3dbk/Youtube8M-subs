00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.710
 the procedures we use inside 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.150
 of society 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.950
 Something we used to talk about. 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.940
 enough seems to us for example about 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.550
 ethic 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.859
 we do not work ethics for 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.619
 conviction we work in ethics for 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:23.449
 coercion if you do not comply with the laws you 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.339
 it will be punished then why you comply 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.839
 for fear of being punished because you 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.279
 like these laws 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:31.279
 if you had an opportunity not 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.800
 This is not education . 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.719
 Strangeness is the dog that does not die 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.410
 because otherwise you hit but if you do not 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:41.690
 hit and bite is not so if you were 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.820
 robinson crusoe lives alone on an island 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.680
 what laws would be in place then these 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.170
 laws are not real for you are being 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.660
 ethical ethic is one that does because 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.120
 understands the value this has because 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.039
 human being because it performs because I 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.800
 I'm honest because I realize myself being 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.300
 because the plant does photosynthesis that 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.910
 she does not you will hit her 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.980
 not because the plant because I am 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.449
 honest because I'm human for hitting 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.740
 You're your problem, but I can not be. 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.210
 something other than human 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.030
 I'm going to hit the plant and make the 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.340
 photosynthesis when each finds the 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.500
 rightful place fits in 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.689
 universe universe enters the influx 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.579
 harmony and makes cosmos 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.439
 so that expression that I always 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.930
 I tell you what the meaning of 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:26.479
 sacred sacred word is the function of 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.759
 make sense when each of the thing is in the 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.840
 place and fulfill the mission that 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.770
 was created this thing is sacralized 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.719
 Greek tradition there are only two 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.869
 possibilities in life you sacralize 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:41.479
 trivialize seek sacralization seek 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.909
 every thing in its place that is also the 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.290
 concept of justice on duty and the man 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.270
 in the place of men 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.610
 and if men were to take the place of men 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.680
 we need not prevent the consequences 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.259
 of the man who behaves like an animal 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.360
 because he is not an animal not 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.409
 we must prevent the consequences of 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.420
 a plant that does not photosynthesis 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.409
 because she plants she will do 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.930
 photosynthesis 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.340
 this is proper to her nature. 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.890
 difference of the man who has the free 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.869
 I can not decide if I want to. 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.759
 makes us glorious when we are men 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.129
 because we chose said no that the 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.710
 nature in the tutelou obliged us having 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.840
 all the possibilities of the universe want 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.780
 week because that is what is expected of 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.960
 me embedding myself in the flow and energies 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.180
 circulate for all the children of the earth and 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.220
 the universe comes into harmony 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.560
 meaning that our creations are not 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.380
 obstacles that everything we create 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.450
 to be a factor of our evolution and 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.360
 not obstacles that we do not have to 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.770
 create walls to evaluate the 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.020
 consequences of defects that do not 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.080
 we can correct what we can 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.790
 correcting our faults we can 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.530
 more and more integrate with the 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.150
 nature and that investments are not 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.710
 are impediments to this 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.500
 quite the opposite are responses to 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.450
 This is winter, I get paid summer 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.480
 I need to cover myself so much. 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.340
 by the law of necessity and not for 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.190
 correct an animal error that I did not know 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.130
 put in its proper place because we 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.500
 we are human and nature expects 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.500
 let us be that protocol to build and 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.730
 needs this and we need it too. 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.080
 whoever says that we do every 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.080
 time it is realized what is
