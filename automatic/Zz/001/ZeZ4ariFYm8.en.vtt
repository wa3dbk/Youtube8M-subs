for a day we learned the basics of how a

00:07:02.679 --> 00:07:04.980 
for a day we learned the basics of how a
Disney<00:07:03.009> film<00:07:03.159> was<00:07:03.309> made<00:07:03.520> after<00:07:03.849> that<00:07:04.599> I

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:04.990 
Disney film was made after that I

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.779 
Disney film was made after that I
watched<00:07:05.319> tons<00:07:05.619> of<00:07:05.800> videos<00:07:06.069> since<00:07:06.369> each<00:07:06.520> movie

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:06.789 
watched tons of videos since each movie

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:08.669 
watched tons of videos since each movie
has<00:07:06.879> a<00:07:06.909> different<00:07:07.209> feel<00:07:07.449> I<00:07:07.689> was<00:07:08.409> watching

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:08.679 
has a different feel I was watching

00:07:08.679 --> 00:07:10.439 
has a different feel I was watching
nothing<00:07:08.889> but<00:07:09.159> Disney<00:07:09.279> videos<00:07:09.669> for<00:07:09.849> six<00:07:10.059> months

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:10.449 
nothing but Disney videos for six months

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:12.299 
nothing but Disney videos for six months
I<00:07:10.629> study<00:07:11.379> the<00:07:11.499> characteristics<00:07:11.800> of<00:07:12.219> each

00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:12.309 
I study the characteristics of each

00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:14.010 
I study the characteristics of each
character<00:07:12.639> and<00:07:12.969> then<00:07:13.419> delivered<00:07:13.749> them<00:07:13.839> into

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:14.020 
character and then delivered them into

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.260 
character and then delivered them into
the<00:07:14.110> game<00:07:14.289> and<00:07:14.979> I<00:07:15.069> think<00:07:15.309> that's<00:07:15.520> really

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:16.270 
the game and I think that's really

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.719 
the game and I think that's really
displayed<00:07:16.959> beautifully<00:07:17.649> in<00:07:17.860> how<00:07:18.099> well<00:07:18.399> they

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:18.729 
displayed beautifully in how well they

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:21.089 
displayed beautifully in how well they
animated<00:07:19.240> the<00:07:19.330> characters<00:07:19.629> in<00:07:19.749> 3d<00:07:20.139> they<00:07:20.740> moved

00:07:21.089 --> 00:07:21.099 
animated the characters in 3d they moved

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:22.920 
animated the characters in 3d they moved
just<00:07:21.399> like<00:07:21.520> their<00:07:21.819> 2d<00:07:22.119> animated<00:07:22.569> in<00:07:22.719> a<00:07:22.749> lot<00:07:22.899> of

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:22.930 
just like their 2d animated in a lot of

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.230 
just like their 2d animated in a lot of
place<00:07:23.169> and<00:07:23.469> so<00:07:24.069> those<00:07:24.430> chalk<00:07:24.729> talks<00:07:25.029> thing

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240 
place and so those chalk talks thing

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.109 
place and so those chalk talks thing
really<00:07:25.360> paid<00:07:25.629> off

00:07:27.109 --> 00:07:27.119 
really paid off

00:07:27.119 --> 00:07:29.219 
really paid off
after<00:07:28.119> spending<00:07:28.300> a<00:07:28.449> considerable<00:07:28.930> amount<00:07:29.110> of

00:07:29.219 --> 00:07:29.229 
after spending a considerable amount of

00:07:29.229 --> 00:07:30.869 
after spending a considerable amount of
