00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
that's my thought all right well here's

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.320 
that's my thought all right well here's
a<00:00:28.560> short<00:00:28.920> word<00:00:29.070> let's<00:00:29.310> get<00:00:29.429> out<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.699> open

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
a short word let's get out of open

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.830 
a short word let's get out of open
practice<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.410> came<00:00:31.590> in<00:00:32.300> as<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.600> plainly

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
practice that it came in as you plainly

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.450 
practice that it came in as you plainly
see<00:00:34.110> around<00:00:34.290> here<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.100> controller

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
see around here that is the controller

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.010 
see around here that is the controller
cost<00:00:36.030> me<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.270> cool<00:00:37.340> $24<00:00:38.340> wired<00:00:39.120> so<00:00:39.780> it's

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
cost me a cool $24 wired so it's

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.049 
cost me a cool $24 wired so it's
actually<00:00:40.140> cheaper<00:00:40.500> than<00:00:40.860> actual<00:00:41.850> xbox

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
actually cheaper than actual xbox

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.119 
actually cheaper than actual xbox
controller<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.320> glows<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.620> dark<00:00:43.710> so

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
controller and it glows in the dark so

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.450 
controller and it glows in the dark so
cool<00:00:44.460> i<00:00:45.200> was<00:00:46.200> just<00:00:46.260> open<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:46.770> bad<00:00:46.980> way<00:00:47.190> if<00:00:47.309> i

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
cool i was just open this bad way if i

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.979 
cool i was just open this bad way if i
could<00:00:47.610> figure<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:48.000> out<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.510> looks<00:00:48.660> like<00:00:48.719> it

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
could figure this out it looks like it

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.600 
could figure this out it looks like it
actually<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.379> was<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.530> pretty<00:00:49.770> sweet<00:00:50.100> box<00:00:50.370> if

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
actually it was a pretty sweet box if

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.610 
actually it was a pretty sweet box if
you<00:00:50.700> could<00:00:50.850> see<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.180> right<00:00:51.329> here<00:00:51.469> so<00:00:52.469> it's

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
you could see this right here so it's

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.319 
you could see this right here so it's
gonna<00:00:52.710> look<00:00:52.800> like<00:00:52.980> gonna<00:00:53.219> close<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.820> don't<00:00:54.210> want

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
gonna look like gonna close I don't want

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.939 
gonna look like gonna close I don't want
to<00:00:54.390> ruin<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:54.719> box<00:00:54.960> actually<00:00:55.199> quite<00:00:55.500> nice<00:00:55.680> but

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
to ruin this box actually quite nice but

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.110 
to ruin this box actually quite nice but
so<00:00:56.100> let<00:00:56.190> me<00:00:56.250> see<00:00:56.340> if<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.460> can<00:00:56.579> figure<00:00:56.730> out<00:00:56.850> how<00:00:57.000> to

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
so let me see if I can figure out how to

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.700 
so let me see if I can figure out how to
open<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.420> thing<00:00:57.600> without<00:00:57.870> ripping<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.680> to

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
open this thing without ripping it to

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.340 
open this thing without ripping it to
shreds<00:00:58.859> real<00:00:59.820> quick<00:01:00.059> looks<00:01:01.020> like<00:01:01.140> there's

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
shreds real quick looks like there's

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.349 
shreds real quick looks like there's
some<00:01:01.410> sort<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.859> sleep<00:01:02.430> you're<00:01:02.820> like<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.000> slider

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
some sort of sleep you're like a slider

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.600 
some sort of sleep you're like a slider
if<00:01:03.629> i<00:01:03.690> can<00:01:03.840> get<00:01:03.899> my<00:01:04.019> fat<00:01:04.350> ass<00:01:04.650> bump<00:01:05.129> into<00:01:05.460> their

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
if i can get my fat ass bump into their

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.780 
if i can get my fat ass bump into their
that'd<00:01:05.790> be<00:01:05.880> nice<00:01:06.229> ya<00:01:07.280> know<00:01:08.280> that's<00:01:08.490> definite

radioactive<00:02:58.940> essentially<00:02:59.750> so<00:02:59.989> yeah<00:03:00.230> it's

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
radioactive essentially so yeah it's

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.380 
radioactive essentially so yeah it's
hard<00:03:01.130> to<00:03:01.250> tell<00:03:01.430> us<00:03:01.549> try<00:03:01.790> to<00:03:01.820> back<00:03:02.030> it<00:03:02.209> up<00:03:02.269> a<00:03:02.360> bit

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
hard to tell us try to back it up a bit

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.030 
hard to tell us try to back it up a bit
more<00:03:02.630> hopefully<00:03:02.989> that<00:03:03.110> will<00:03:03.200> help<00:03:03.350> but<00:03:03.560> it's

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
more hopefully that will help but it's

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.960 
more hopefully that will help but it's
really<00:03:04.220> bright<00:03:04.489> as<00:03:04.580> you<00:03:04.640> can<00:03:04.730> see<00:03:04.850> it's
