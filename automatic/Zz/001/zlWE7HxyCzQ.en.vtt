00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.979
 my police over 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:24.449

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.830
 that the police 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.830
 there are no meetings 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:55.520
 the government is the german but 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.789

 beautiful on this car why me it 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:26.370
 absolutely wanted to have such a map 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:46.440
 drive it to the airport and there 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:46.920
 turn off and that 's just cheaper than 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.440
 sexy 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:52.319
 with office from me to the airport 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:57.240
 You can easily forget stuttgart 

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:57.240
 I'm done so far 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.070
 Hello 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.070
 with nine women 

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:06.699
 now again about where I am 

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:07.870
 I see I'm very much in principle 

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:10.539
 I think it's a good idea 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:15.330
 if you have no space but it 

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:18.969
 you can turn off everywhere so looks 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:21.090
 disappeared from the map something 

00:07:18.969 --> 00:07:24.460
 I did to him 

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:26.169
 but otherwise everything went well so 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.300
 nice to be home somehow 

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:30.819
 but probably they could 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.729
 fear that people will get theirs 

00:07:30.819 --> 00:07:36.930
 torch house electrics 

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:39.569
 it is certainly in this house 

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:44.400
 entitled thoughts can 

00:07:39.569 --> 00:07:44.400
 a good thing would say mike
