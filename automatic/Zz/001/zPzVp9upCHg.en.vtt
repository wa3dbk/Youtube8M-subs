00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.460
 good gustavo there are times that one talks about 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.539
 say it in a restyling a redesign a 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.520
 face wash as we did 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.160
 affectionately some preaching but in this 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.860
 case there is a resounding change of course if 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.870
 in a month in compact sedan that aims 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.700
 much to the functional but in this case 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.440
 read or in an aesthetic plus of 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.570
 technology brings many neurologists 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.489
 not evidently with the new they achieve what 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.920
 what we wanted to do is keep a little 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.110
 the original car characteristics 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.970
 the robustness the habitability one of the 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.700
 most habitable cars of the segment very 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.920
 reliable but already giving it a design 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.680
 much more modern the body was 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.149
 totally renovated the interior was 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.300
 completely renovated were used 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.770
 materials of very good quality and also 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.600
 with very modern design that incorporates 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.969
 also the new identity image of 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.050
 reindeer brand so also logan 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.730
 it evolves a bit in its dimensions 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.369
 It has a little more distance between 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.799
 axes what benefits habitability and 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.650
 retains the same trunk capacity as 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.050
 the previous logan but with a very 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.690
 very interesting very attractive that we 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.090
 allows to cover this time if all the 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.670
 segment is to say this from the entrance 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.540
 of range the logan segment up 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.160
 compete already with more equipped cars 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.560
 of that same segment as a man of 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.090
 design that is a pencil man of 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.130
 drawing and the coach of the subject that 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.470
 I decide if you have to highlight me 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.180
 characteristics in terms of great robustness 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.310
 sophistication like he could 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.200
 define and I think the car when 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.090
 you see it the first thing you say has 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.890
 very good quality there is one what is 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.869
 called the perceived quality well was 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.240
 worked a lot in this car voices 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.880
 the quality of the paint the quality of 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.710
 the assemblies between the pieces the 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.300
 interior also of course has been 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.369
 greatly improved from that point of view 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.930
 then to me the first thing that the 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.390
 first feeling that this car gives me is 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.190
 a quality car after the design 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.640
 also represents the robustness to you 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.040
 notice that you have generous side raisins 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.929
 wheels that are well marked sir 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.510
 I think they did a very good job in 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.480
 combine the feeling of robustness with 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.650
 of fluidity and elegance because I think that 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.260
 it also has a certain elegance 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.730
 even when you look at it suddenly 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.819
 it looks like a car from a superior segment 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.599
 maybe the first the campaign 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.519
 advertising 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.900
 together much presented like this is a place and 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.060
 that's what these important developments 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.230
 that they expect from him I say taking in 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.700
 that they get a redesign 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.799
 clearly because what was coming had 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.450
 bet the function at 6 I say out there you 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.829
 you are missing vales a little the back was floor 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.390
 commercial I say with this that are 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.069
 waiting and look at us today we are in 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.900
 the fifth position in the segment that 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.909
 we must absolutely be among the 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.829
 leaders of this segment the ambition is 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:52.930
 be at least seconds in the 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:55.510
 second position of the segment and I think that 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.260
 we can do it with prices that include 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.540
 from 96 thousand pesos to 116 219 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.819
 in the case of pri vil split that sainz 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.950
 even incorporates leather seats in 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.510
 this range in the study which the 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.310
 buyer what is the user of the logan 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.170
 to which you point now and now is 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.060
 a rather large fan not true of 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.159
 users because of course there are the 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.560
 faithful users who use the logan for 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:19.720
 I do not know how to work 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.609
 remises I think of taxis well where 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.920
 the car is very well conceptualized and 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.540
 then of course it's a family car 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.989
 has char all the equipments of 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.360
 Comfort a medium very much improved with 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.069
 functions that allow you to see how much 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.220
 consume on the whole subject of the 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:38.140
 ecoconduction of the naphtha economy 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.870
 of course and also of course the 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.970
 GPS and parking sensor control 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.880
 cruise speed limiter good 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.310
 the car the air conditioner good entry 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.440
 usb bluetooth let's say all the 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.410
 equipment even unpublished in this 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.760
 segment what allows you as I said 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.470
 take advantage of a very wide range of 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.540
 clients you say of the fifth 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.519
 climb position climb that translated 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.500
 in full year figures more or less than 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.630
 volume so more or less are about 20 thousand 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.250
 cars per year what what we think 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.600
 sell from home and I think with 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.640
 this product we can calmly 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.319
 reach immediately comes the 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.690
 officials are already dealers 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.250
 already in December we can we can 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.340
 buy with very interesting options 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.739
 for what is the purchase in December and 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.740
 of course we are already thinking about the 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.139
 year 2014 I think the 2013 goals already 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.270
 we have achieved them so let's go hard 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.610
 with 2014 and I think the home is going 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.440
 help a lot coming from Brazil the logo 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.900
 It is made in Brazil and the theme of 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.370
 Catering is insured 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.379
 and if not what is what is the 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.659
 Brazilian or Argentine exchange does not have 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:44.370
 problem but we keep going without 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:44.370
 I liked many fateful problems thanks
