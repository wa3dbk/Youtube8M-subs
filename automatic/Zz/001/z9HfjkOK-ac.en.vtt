 regarding 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.130
 there is a measurement this relationship is absolute 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.360
 under 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.910
 cut nasty real value 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.060
 measured value relative 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.430
 error is by 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.410
 but either measured as a percentage of you 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.090
 instrument accuracy is instrument 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.100
 accuracy accuracy class 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.900
 set by the manufacturer 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.390
 while it should be no more 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.910
 minimum prices division imperfection

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.150
 a source 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.740
 accuracy accuracy of instruments 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.300
 percentage 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.420
 maximum permissible error 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.260
 instrument measurement value is highest 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.410
 accuracy class 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.810
 this is the accuracy class 0102 it is characteristic 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.280
 for exemplary measurement devices from 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.090
 common accuracy class 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.070
 051 peculiar to most devices 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.780
 measurements that can be portable 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.240
 and fixed or installed on 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.090
 transportation and finally a device with a class 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.560
 accuracy 1 and 5 2 and 5 this device 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.780
 which is used to measure 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.460
 which do not require high precision or 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.549
 used as an instrument 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.830
 indicator will give an example to you accuracy 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.049
 01 corresponds to measurement error 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.970
 zero one percent accuracy class two s 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.009
 half corresponds to the error 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.659
 measuring two and a half percent at 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.369
 selection of this or that device 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.560
 counted first to you 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.179
 accuracy is the most common medium 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.380
 application of measuring heads 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:27.479
 not less than two and a half percent 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.700
 precision household appliances 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.509
 for example the popular analog 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.219
 measuring heads a vm 80 30 data 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.719
 analog heads designed to 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:39.509
 using in electronic devices 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:41.369
 switchboards of transport 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.829
 means and the like accuracy class 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.590
 two and a half digital measuring 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.249
 pm pm lcd has the ability 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.109
 installation of input voltage divider 

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:54.210
 allowing me to change limits to 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:56.969
 your accuracy of these devices 0 5 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.899
 percent acquiring this or that 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.939
 measuring device 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.889
 always consider his perfection and 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.429
 errors in class measurement 

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:04.429
