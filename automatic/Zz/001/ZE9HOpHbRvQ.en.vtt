00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 I was once asked why everyone is doing 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.870
 greeting the sun and no one does 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.769
 greeting the moon and so catching from me 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:14.490
 greeting the moon inhale raise your hands 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.949
 up and slightly back belly up 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.380
 we will not bend much 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.890
 back down on the exhale down and 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.050
 press your spine to the legs straighten 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.349
 let's look ahead and walk our hands 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.380
 legs forward from taking over the plank will do 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.079
 pushups and now let's do the bar on 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.000
 one side and you and one crescent moon 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.770
 if you can't find balance 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.590
 crescent will be okay 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.700
 just in the side bar we change the side 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.590
 through 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:49.800
 pushups and so the second side is trying 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.610
 find balance and make crescent arm 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.690
 through the head the stomach is pulled in and we return 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.660
 in the bar and out of the bar we go dog 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.409
 looking snout down a little bend 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.070
 and again in the bar and through the bar in the cobra 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.470
 or dog looking muzzle up 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.590
 back up as much as we can eat again 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.200
 in the dog looking face down now 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.280
 the bar and repeat the crescents with only 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.590
 the other side of the crescent on one hand 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.979
 belly pulled you are not afraid of raising 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.869
 hips up and crescent on the other 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.090
 to the side 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.400
 to pull your hips up your arm through 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.060
 head if it fails just be 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.150
 in the bar and back the dog muzzle 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.150

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.150

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.550
 straight silver 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.300
 repeat hands up again 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.130
 and this time you can already bend over 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.620
 a little more back 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.800
 However, do not forget to strain your buttocks and 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.470
 belly pulled 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.490
 as you exhale, slide down and press down to 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.470
 legs put your hands on their feet see 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.680

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:20.890
 step back or jump for a year do 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:23.290
 pushups and maybe another one and again 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.430
 we will make a side bar this time 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.350
 take 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.330
 hand after foot if both violated 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.360
 stay in the side rail or 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.570
 put one foot on the other 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.070
 then it turns out and we change the side and a 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.900
 other side lift your leg up 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.670
 I try to find a balance 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.130
 if nothing's wrong 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.950
 will succeed next time we stretch the leg 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.610
 up and try to find our wounds si 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:53.020

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:56.340

 gram of us goes not just up but rather 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:09.640
 diagonally up and change the leg of a friend 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.540
 sometimes just the same goes up and we 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.540
