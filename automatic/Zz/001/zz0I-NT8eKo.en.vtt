00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.450 
Friendship is Magic
putting<00:00:05.790> your<00:00:05.940> hoof<00:00:06.240> down<00:00:07.040> it<00:00:08.040> was<00:00:08.160> kind<00:00:08.340> of<00:00:08.370> a

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
putting your hoof down it was kind of a

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.280 
putting your hoof down it was kind of a
reasonable<00:00:08.940> episode<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:09.809> enjoyed<00:00:10.080> it<00:00:10.200> for

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
reasonable episode and enjoyed it for

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.930 
reasonable episode and enjoyed it for
the<00:00:10.349> most<00:00:10.500> part<00:00:10.620> or<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.160> few<00:00:11.309> things<00:00:11.550> I<00:00:11.700> didn't

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
the most part or a few things I didn't

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.499 
the most part or a few things I didn't
like<00:00:11.969> about<00:00:12.240> it<00:00:13.429> but<00:00:14.429> I<00:00:14.490> think<00:00:14.549> probably<00:00:15.210> the

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
like about it but I think probably the

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.880 
like about it but I think probably the
main<00:00:15.780> problem<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:16.350> had<00:00:16.650> with<00:00:16.800> this<00:00:16.920> episode<00:00:17.400> was

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
main problem I had with this episode was

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.689 
main problem I had with this episode was
once<00:00:19.890> again<00:00:20.250> this<00:00:20.580> shows<00:00:20.880> lack<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.600> continuity

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
once again this shows lack of continuity

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.429 
once again this shows lack of continuity
given<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.970> events<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.480> episode<00:00:24.900> DRAQ<00:00:25.260> and

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
given the events of the episode DRAQ and

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.939 
given the events of the episode DRAQ and
shy<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:26.180> Stairmaster<00:00:27.529> it<00:00:28.529> really<00:00:28.740> didn't

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
shy and Stairmaster it really didn't

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.529 
shy and Stairmaster it really didn't
make<00:00:29.039> much<00:00:29.250> sense<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.670> me<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.880> flutter<00:00:30.300> shows

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
make much sense to me a flutter shows

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.650 
make much sense to me a flutter shows
behavior<00:00:31.080> in<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.289> episode<00:00:32.420> but<00:00:33.420> after

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
behavior in this episode but after

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.190 
behavior in this episode but after
thinking<00:00:33.840> about<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.350> little<00:00:34.649> bit<00:00:34.800> more<00:00:35.399> I

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
thinking about it a little bit more I

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.049 
thinking about it a little bit more I
actually<00:00:37.200> started<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.739> think<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.070> it's<00:00:38.850> been

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
actually started to think that it's been

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.700 
actually started to think that it's been
debated<00:00:39.210> among<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.780> fan<00:00:39.960> base<00:00:40.110> actually<00:00:40.530> that

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
debated among the fan base actually that

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.410 
debated among the fan base actually that
these<00:00:41.100> episodes<00:00:41.370> are<00:00:41.579> not<00:00:41.760> being<00:00:41.969> shown<00:00:42.210> in

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
these episodes are not being shown in

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.520 
these episodes are not being shown in
chronological<00:00:42.719> order

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
chronological order

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.590 
chronological order
hence<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:44.489> shows<00:00:44.730> complete<00:00:45.390> lack<00:00:45.570> of

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
hence this shows complete lack of

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.190 
hence this shows complete lack of
continuity<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.469> there<00:00:46.649> many<00:00:46.920> areas<00:00:47.570> so<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.989> it

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
continuity in there many areas so is it

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.229 
continuity in there many areas so is it
possible<00:00:49.379> HAP's<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.489> episode

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
possible HAP's that this episode

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.939 
possible HAP's that this episode
actually<00:00:51.690> precedes<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.379> events<00:00:52.770> of

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
actually precedes the events of

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.260 
actually precedes the events of
Stairmaster<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.969> dragon<00:00:54.840> shy

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.320 

and<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.990> also<00:00:58.260> started<00:00:58.830> to<00:00:59.010> think<00:00:59.160> about<00:00:59.220> it<00:00:59.610> in

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.330 
and I also started to think about it in

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.270 
and I also started to think about it in
a<00:01:00.420> bit<00:01:00.570> more<00:01:00.690> detail<00:01:00.900> and<00:01:01.380> considering<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
a bit more detail and considering the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.490 
a bit more detail and considering the
fact<00:01:02.490> that<00:01:02.610> we<00:01:03.150> actually<00:01:03.690> don't<00:01:03.780> see<00:01:03.930> Twilight

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
fact that we actually don't see Twilight

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.460 
fact that we actually don't see Twilight
or<00:01:04.920> spike<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.910> this<00:01:06.210> episode<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:07.350> is

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
or spike in this episode and this is

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.930 
or spike in this episode and this is
only<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.830> second<00:01:08.220> episode<00:01:08.310> where<00:01:08.670> that's<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
only the second episode where that's the

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.690 
only the second episode where that's the
case<00:01:09.620> family<00:01:10.620> appreciation<00:01:11.070> day<00:01:11.250> being<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
case family appreciation day being the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.740 
case family appreciation day being the
other<00:01:11.850> one

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
other one

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.080 
other one
so<00:01:14.110> is<00:01:14.230> it<00:01:14.350> possible<00:01:14.530> that<00:01:14.800> this<00:01:15.700> episode

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
so is it possible that this episode

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.060 
so is it possible that this episode
actually<00:01:16.270> takes<00:01:16.600> place<00:01:16.810> before<00:01:17.170> Twilight<00:01:17.770> and

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
actually takes place before Twilight and

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.840 
actually takes place before Twilight and
Spike<00:01:18.340> came<00:01:18.730> to<00:01:18.910> live<00:01:19.090> in<00:01:19.120> Ponyville

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
Spike came to live in Ponyville

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.510 
Spike came to live in Ponyville
and<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.840> what<00:01:22.080> could<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.350> perhaps<00:01:22.590> be<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
and that what could it perhaps be the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.969 
and that what could it perhaps be the
very<00:01:24.330> first<00:01:24.690> episode<00:01:24.979> chronologically

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
very first episode chronologically

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.179 
very first episode chronologically

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
speaking

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:28.739 
speaking
would<00:01:27.369> this<00:01:27.490> be<00:01:27.549> here<00:01:27.939> the<00:01:28.119> first<00:01:28.359> episode

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:28.749 
would this be here the first episode

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:30.870 
would this be here the first episode
we've<00:01:28.929> ever<00:01:29.109> seen<00:01:29.319> that<00:01:29.530> proceeds<00:01:30.249> the<00:01:30.490> events

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880

I'm<00:01:37.860> not<00:01:38.070> absolutely<00:01:38.250> sure<00:01:38.610> about<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:39.030> moment

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
I'm not absolutely sure about the moment

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.030 
I'm not absolutely sure about the moment
I<00:01:39.360> mean<00:01:39.540> Fluttershy<00:01:40.290> doesn't<00:01:40.650> write<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> letter

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
I mean Fluttershy doesn't write a letter

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.460 
I mean Fluttershy doesn't write a letter
to<00:01:41.189> princess<00:01:41.700> last<00:01:42.000> year<00:01:42.270> at<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.170> end<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.350> this

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
to princess last year at the end of this

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.680 
to princess last year at the end of this
episode<00:01:43.650> and<00:01:44.060> given<00:01:45.060> what<00:01:45.180> we<00:01:45.330> see<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:46.080> season

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
episode and given what we see in season

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.410 
episode and given what we see in season
season<00:01:48.690> 1<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.110> also<00:01:50.010> what<00:01:50.430> we<00:01:50.940> see<00:01:51.120> in<00:01:51.210> the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
season 1 and also what we see in the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.500 
season 1 and also what we see in the
events<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.080> less<00:01:52.440> than<00:01:52.590> zero<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.510> doesn't

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
events of less than zero that doesn't

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.730 
events of less than zero that doesn't
really<00:01:54.660> make<00:01:54.810> much<00:01:54.960> sense<00:01:55.200> if<00:01:55.440> this<00:01:55.590> is

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
really make much sense if this is

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.140 
really make much sense if this is
supposed<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.130> take<00:01:56.340> place<00:01:56.460> before<00:01:56.790> those

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
supposed to take place before those

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.740 
supposed to take place before those
episodes<00:01:57.950> but<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.400> still<00:01:59.700> say<00:02:00.330> that<00:02:00.479> it's
