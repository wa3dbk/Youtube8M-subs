00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
bottom of the pumpkin we'll be using the

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.910 
bottom of the pumpkin we'll be using the
stencils<00:00:27.730> that<00:00:27.820> come<00:00:28.090> inside<00:00:28.240> and<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:29.740> help

stencils that come inside and to help
fix<00:00:30.189> extensions<00:00:30.759> to<00:00:30.849> the<00:00:30.880> pumpkin<00:00:31.210> we're

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
fix extensions to the pumpkin we're

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.420 
fix extensions to the pumpkin we're
going<00:00:31.539> to<00:00:31.630> use<00:00:31.779> some<00:00:31.810> masking<00:00:32.410> tape<00:00:32.410> and<00:00:32.829> some

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
going to use some masking tape and some

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.119 
going to use some masking tape and some
push<00:00:33.640> pins<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:35.290> begin<00:00:35.530> with<00:00:35.739> we're<00:00:35.950> going<00:00:36.070> to

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
push pins to begin with we're going to

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:38.160 
push pins to begin with we're going to
open<00:00:36.280> our<00:00:36.520> pumpkin<00:00:36.940> most<00:00:37.450> people<00:00:37.809> open<00:00:38.079> it

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
open our pumpkin most people open it

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.319 
open our pumpkin most people open it
from<00:00:38.289> the<00:00:38.469> top<00:00:38.649> create<00:00:39.190> a<00:00:39.219> lid<00:00:39.460> but<00:00:40.030> that<00:00:40.180> could

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
from the top create a lid but that could

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:41.549 
from the top create a lid but that could
fall<00:00:40.539> in<00:00:40.719> later<00:00:40.960> and<00:00:41.140> it<00:00:41.260> makes<00:00:41.410> it<00:00:41.530> difficult

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
fall in later and it makes it difficult

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:43.799 
fall in later and it makes it difficult
to<00:00:42.070> life<00:00:42.250> so<00:00:42.820> instead<00:00:43.180> we're<00:00:43.510> going<00:00:43.629> to<00:00:43.690> open

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
to life so instead we're going to open

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.720 
to life so instead we're going to open
the<00:00:44.050> bottom<00:00:44.440> and<00:00:44.680> pull<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.070> plug<00:00:45.280> out<00:00:45.460> and

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
the bottom and pull the plug out and

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:55.770 
the bottom and pull the plug out and
that<00:00:46.239> makes<00:00:46.449> it<00:00:46.570> easy<00:00:46.780> to<00:00:46.899> set<00:00:47.199> over<00:00:47.410> the<00:00:47.530> light

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.240 

the<00:00:56.780> next<00:00:57.050> step<00:00:57.200> is<00:00:57.380> to<00:00:57.500> get<00:00:57.620> all<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:57.950> strings

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
the next step is to get all the strings

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.580 
the next step is to get all the strings
in<00:00:58.460> the<00:00:58.550> seeds<00:00:58.790> from<00:00:59.059> the<00:00:59.180> inside<00:00:59.570> out<00:00:59.600> and<00:01:00.050> for

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
in the seeds from the inside out and for

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.440 
in the seeds from the inside out and for
that<00:01:00.680> there's<00:01:00.980> a<00:01:01.040> couple<00:01:01.220> of<00:01:01.430> tools<00:01:01.640> look<00:01:02.239> for

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
that there's a couple of tools look for

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.899 
that there's a couple of tools look for
tools<00:01:02.629> with<00:01:02.899> serrated<00:01:03.230> edges<00:01:03.559> I<00:01:03.890> work<00:01:04.430> easy<00:01:04.670> on

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
tools with serrated edges I work easy on

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.880 
tools with serrated edges I work easy on
the<00:01:05.030> inside<00:01:05.360> and<00:01:05.840> all<00:01:05.960> you<00:01:06.110> do<00:01:06.290> is<00:01:06.320> you<00:01:06.619> swipe

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
the inside and all you do is you swipe

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.859 
the inside and all you do is you swipe
the<00:01:07.070> side<00:01:07.280> and<00:01:07.550> it<00:01:08.030> takes<00:01:08.240> all<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.570> strings

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
the side and it takes all the strings

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.280 
the side and it takes all the strings
off<00:01:10.240> all<00:01:11.240> right<00:01:11.360> so<00:01:11.540> with<00:01:11.690> the<00:01:11.810> strings<00:01:12.110> all

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
off all right so with the strings all

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.810 
off all right so with the strings all
gone<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.740> next<00:01:12.890> step<00:01:13.190> is<00:01:13.340> going<00:01:13.490> to<00:01:13.580> be<00:01:13.640> to

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
gone the next step is going to be to

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.300 
gone the next step is going to be to
thin<00:01:14.060> out<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.420> carving<00:01:14.840> face<00:01:15.110> and<00:01:15.380> to<00:01:16.070> clean

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
thin out the carving face and to clean

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.420 
thin out the carving face and to clean
out<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:17.000> edges<00:01:17.119> on<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.600> inside<00:01:17.990> for<00:01:18.800> that<00:01:18.979> use

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
out the edges on the inside for that use

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.219 
out the edges on the inside for that use
a<00:01:19.460> smooth<00:01:19.820> shape<00:01:20.090> tool<00:01:20.360> or<00:01:20.570> a<00:01:20.630> large<00:01:21.020> kitchen

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
a smooth shape tool or a large kitchen

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.290 
a smooth shape tool or a large kitchen
spoon<00:01:21.680> so<00:01:22.340> we're<00:01:22.460> going<00:01:22.580> to<00:01:22.670> put<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:22.940> carving

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
spoon so we're going to put the carving

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.969 
spoon so we're going to put the carving
pattern<00:01:23.630> on<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:23.900> face<00:01:24.080> of<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:24.380> pumpkin<00:01:24.650> and

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
pattern on the face of the pumpkin and

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.950 
pattern on the face of the pumpkin and
to<00:01:25.340> do<00:01:25.490> that<00:01:25.700> and<00:01:25.909> hold<00:01:26.090> it<00:01:26.240> in<00:01:26.330> place<00:01:26.479> we<00:01:26.869> can

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
to do that and hold it in place we can

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.770 
to do that and hold it in place we can
either<00:01:27.200> use<00:01:27.229> masking<00:01:27.979> tape<00:01:28.220> or<00:01:28.850> we<00:01:29.479> can<00:01:29.630> use

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
either use masking tape or we can use

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.719 
either use masking tape or we can use
these<00:01:29.930> little<00:01:30.200> office<00:01:30.350> supply<00:01:30.830> pins<00:01:31.130> to<00:01:31.399> poke

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
these little office supply pins to poke

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.120 
these little office supply pins to poke
in<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:32.030> excess<00:01:32.539> and<00:01:32.750> hold<00:01:33.560> a<00:01:33.649> pattern<00:01:34.009> in

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
in the excess and hold a pattern in

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.539 
in the excess and hold a pattern in
place

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.010 

here's<00:01:41.549> another<00:01:41.670> good<00:01:42.090> reason<00:01:42.329> why<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.659> use

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
here's another good reason why I use

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.609 
here's another good reason why I use
these<00:01:43.049> little<00:01:43.469> pins<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:45.479> pin<00:01:45.719> length<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.259> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
these little pins the pin length is the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.590 
these little pins the pin length is the
exact<00:01:47.130> thickness<00:01:47.789> that<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.299> want<00:01:48.479> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
exact thickness that you want the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.060 
exact thickness that you want the
pumpkin<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.049> be<00:01:49.170> when<00:01:49.350> you're<00:01:49.500> ready<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.829> carve

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
pumpkin to be when you're ready to carve

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.460 
pumpkin to be when you're ready to carve
so<00:01:50.759> if<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.970> look<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.390> inside<00:01:51.570> face<00:01:52.049> you

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
so if you look on the inside face you

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.169 
so if you look on the inside face you
should<00:01:52.649> just<00:01:52.829> start<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.220> see<00:01:53.429> some<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
should just start to see some of the

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.240 
should just start to see some of the
pins<00:01:54.420> poking<00:01:55.020> through<00:01:55.259> now's<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.890> time<00:01:56.219> where

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
pins poking through now's the time where

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.529 
pins poking through now's the time where
you<00:01:56.460> get<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.700> make<00:01:56.820> your<00:01:56.880> pumpkin<00:01:57.360> more

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539

the cut I usually try to start with the
small<00:02:43.110> detail<00:02:43.530> features<00:02:43.980> first<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.579> then

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
small detail features first and then

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.000 
small detail features first and then
leave<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.840> larger<00:02:46.260> chunks<00:02:46.620> in<00:02:46.739> as<00:02:46.890> you

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
leave the larger chunks in as you

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.979 
leave the larger chunks in as you
complete<00:02:47.340> them<00:02:47.549> to<00:02:47.940> give<00:02:48.120> more<00:02:48.299> rigidity<00:02:48.630> to

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
complete them to give more rigidity to

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.410

your carving to start start at the

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.750 
your carving to start start at the
corner<00:02:51.840> of<00:02:51.989> one<00:02:52.380> of<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.560> edges<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.010> just

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
corner of one of the edges and just

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.699 
corner of one of the edges and just
gently<00:02:54.150> assert<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.750> sauce<00:02:54.989> straight<00:02:55.380> up<00:02:55.530> and

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709

okay<00:03:13.660> a<00:03:13.690> couple<00:03:13.870> things<00:03:14.170> I'm<00:03:14.410> doing

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
okay a couple things I'm doing

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.290 
okay a couple things I'm doing
differently<00:03:15.100> than<00:03:15.490> most<00:03:15.670> people<00:03:16.090> you'll

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
differently than most people you'll

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.910 
differently than most people you'll
notice<00:03:16.570> I'm<00:03:16.690> carving<00:03:16.990> right<00:03:17.350> through<00:03:17.710> the

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
notice I'm carving right through the

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.440 
notice I'm carving right through the
stencil<00:03:18.340> instead<00:03:18.730> of<00:03:18.760> transferring<00:03:19.090> it<00:03:19.420> to

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
stencil instead of transferring it to

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.270 
stencil instead of transferring it to
the<00:03:19.630> pumpkin<00:03:19.900> first<00:03:20.230> if<00:03:20.650> you<00:03:20.830> did<00:03:21.010> want<00:03:21.160> to

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
the pumpkin first if you did want to

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.740 
the pumpkin first if you did want to
transfer<00:03:21.670> it<00:03:21.760> you<00:03:21.880> could<00:03:22.060> use<00:03:22.180> carbon<00:03:22.600> back

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
transfer it you could use carbon back

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.240 
transfer it you could use carbon back
paper<00:03:23.050> underneath<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.620> pattern<00:03:23.950> and<00:03:24.100> just

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
paper underneath the pattern and just

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.890 
paper underneath the pattern and just
draw<00:03:24.490> the<00:03:24.520> lines<00:03:24.910> they<00:03:25.210> would<00:03:25.390> all<00:03:25.510> transfer

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
draw the lines they would all transfer

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.410 
draw the lines they would all transfer
to<00:03:26.020> the<00:03:26.050> pumpkin<00:03:26.410> I<00:03:26.710> have<00:03:27.640> a<00:03:27.670> large<00:03:27.970> irregular

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
to the pumpkin I have a large irregular

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.660 
to the pumpkin I have a large irregular
area<00:03:28.810> that's<00:03:29.050> been<00:03:29.170> cut<00:03:29.410> free<00:03:29.680> here<00:03:29.950> I'm<00:03:30.100> going

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
area that's been cut free here I'm going

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.390 
area that's been cut free here I'm going
to<00:03:30.760> leave<00:03:30.910> it<00:03:30.940> in<00:03:31.150> place<00:03:31.210> but<00:03:32.080> you<00:03:33.040> will<00:03:33.190> notice

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
to leave it in place but you will notice

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.910 
to leave it in place but you will notice
it<00:03:33.730> should<00:03:34.030> move<00:03:34.240> freely<00:03:34.600> and<00:03:34.900> that<00:03:35.680> will<00:03:35.800> make

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
it should move freely and that will make

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.560 
it should move freely and that will make
it<00:03:36.070> easy<00:03:36.220> to<00:03:36.430> take<00:03:36.610> those<00:03:36.760> sections<00:03:37.090> out<00:03:37.270> later

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
it easy to take those sections out later

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.080 
it easy to take those sections out later
the<00:03:38.410> carving<00:03:38.800> is<00:03:38.890> finished<00:03:39.280> so<00:03:39.490> with<00:03:39.940> that

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
the carving is finished so with that

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.810 
the carving is finished so with that
we're<00:03:40.270> going<00:03:40.300> to<00:03:40.420> remove<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.900> paper<00:03:41.110> and<00:03:41.470> the

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
we're going to remove the paper and the

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.350 
we're going to remove the paper and the
pins<00:03:42.820> and<00:03:43.890> then<00:03:44.890> gently<00:03:45.370> remove<00:03:45.910> out<00:03:46.120> the

pins and then gently remove out the
sections<00:03:46.840> and<00:03:46.960> it<00:03:47.080> usually<00:03:47.260> works<00:03:47.650> easiest<00:03:48.100> by

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
sections and it usually works easiest by
