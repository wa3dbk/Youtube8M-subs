Show<00:03:11.440> was<00:03:11.620> going<00:03:11.739> to<00:03:11.799> do<00:03:11.980> much<00:03:12.190> because<00:03:13.120> of<00:03:13.810> his

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
Show was going to do much because of his

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.860 
Show was going to do much because of his
size<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.430> that<00:03:15.640> he<00:03:15.880> really<00:03:16.269> can't<00:03:16.510> compete

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
size and that he really can't compete

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.140 
size and that he really can't compete
that<00:03:17.200> he's<00:03:18.010> never<00:03:18.220> really<00:03:18.370> had<00:03:18.670> a<00:03:18.700> good<00:03:18.940> match

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
that he's never really had a good match

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
that he's never really had a good match
