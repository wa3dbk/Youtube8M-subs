00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
because I know that last time I did it

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.549 
because I know that last time I did it

last<00:00:31.830> time<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.910> exhaust

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
last time the exhaust

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.069 
last time the exhaust
it<00:00:35.520> doesn't<00:00:36.210> fit<00:00:36.360> through<00:00:36.570> there<00:00:36.660> correctly

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
it doesn't fit through there correctly

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.639 
it doesn't fit through there correctly
with<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.219> pipe<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.700> add<00:00:38.910> from<00:00:39.180> mbrp<00:00:39.620> so<00:00:40.620> I

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
with the pipe that I add from mbrp so I

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.700 
with the pipe that I add from mbrp so I
just<00:00:41.280> did<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.670> flexor<00:00:42.090> flex<00:00:42.809> tube<00:00:43.050> because<00:00:43.410> if

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
just did the flexor flex tube because if

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.560 
just did the flexor flex tube because if
the<00:00:43.920> axle<00:00:44.460> does<00:00:44.640> flex<00:00:44.850> up<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.210> don't<00:00:45.270> want<00:00:45.480> it

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
the axle does flex up I don't want it

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.069 
the axle does flex up I don't want it
bending<00:00:45.960> or<00:00:46.110> destroying<00:00:47.149> my<00:00:48.149> exhausts<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.750> I

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
bending or destroying my exhausts that I

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.840 
bending or destroying my exhausts that I
don't<00:00:49.590> really<00:00:49.710> care<00:00:49.920> if<00:00:50.039> from<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.340> muffler<00:00:50.520> to

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
don't really care if from the muffler to

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.920 
don't really care if from the muffler to
there<00:00:51.000> it's<00:00:51.180> not<00:00:51.329> gonna<00:00:51.539> hurt<00:00:51.690> anything

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
there it's not gonna hurt anything

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.590 
there it's not gonna hurt anything
at<00:00:54.930> full<00:00:55.289> flex<00:00:55.920> 435<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.300> do<00:00:58.260> not<00:00:59.210> actually<00:01:00.210> even

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
at full flex 435 I do not actually even

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.470 
at full flex 435 I do not actually even
touch<00:01:00.840> they<00:01:01.500> were<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.859> inside<00:01:02.359> of<00:01:03.359> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
touch they were in the inside of the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.270 
touch they were in the inside of the
funders<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.619> all<00:01:05.540> and<00:01:06.680> that<00:01:07.680> surprised<00:01:08.100> me

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
funders and all and that surprised me

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.280 
funders and all and that surprised me
because<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.729> thought<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:08.939> was<00:01:09.180> gonna<00:01:09.390> rub<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.080> I

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
because I thought I was gonna rub and I

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.210 
because I thought I was gonna rub and I
don't<00:01:11.450> you<00:01:12.450> get<00:01:12.630> quite<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> bit<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.619> flex<00:01:13.979> out<00:01:14.130> of

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
don't you get quite a bit of flex out of

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.899 
don't you get quite a bit of flex out of
the<00:01:14.310> kit<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.640> mean<00:01:15.439> with<00:01:16.439> 35<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.310> don't<00:01:17.729> rub

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
the kit I mean with 35 so you don't rub

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.910 
the kit I mean with 35 so you don't rub
it<00:01:17.939> full<00:01:18.270> flex<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.720> mean<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.990> could<00:01:19.200> put<00:01:19.530> longer

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
it full flex I mean you could put longer

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.980 
it full flex I mean you could put longer
shocks<00:01:20.159> because<00:01:20.340> that's<00:01:20.610> what<00:01:20.820> limits<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
shocks because that's what limits it the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.870 
shocks because that's what limits it the
shocks<00:01:22.259> just<00:01:22.530> max<00:01:22.799> out<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.430> that's<00:01:23.790> the

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
shocks just max out and that's the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.600 
shocks just max out and that's the
problem<00:01:24.259> the<00:01:25.259> brake<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.470> brake<00:01:26.220> lines<00:01:26.460> they

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
problem the brake the brake lines they

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.530 
problem the brake the brake lines they
give<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.880> want<00:01:27.119> max<00:01:27.450> out<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:29.820> shock<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.360> mean

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
give you want max out the shock I mean

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.460 
give you want max out the shock I mean
the<00:01:30.659> coils<00:01:31.369> they're<00:01:32.369> pretty<00:01:33.060> good<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.479> would

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
the coils they're pretty good I would

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.859 
the coils they're pretty good I would
say<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.920> mean<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.729> think<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.180> they<00:01:36.329> can<00:01:36.540> go

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
say I mean I think that they can go

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.109 
say I mean I think that they can go
they're<00:01:37.020> completely<00:01:37.439> di<00:01:37.890> they're<00:01:38.759> stern<00:01:38.939> they

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
they're completely di they're stern they

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:46.219 
they're completely di they're stern they
extend<00:01:39.570> obviously<00:01:42.560> from<00:01:44.509> like<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.689> can<00:01:45.930> tip<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
extend obviously from like I can tip the

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.600 
extend obviously from like I can tip the
Jeep<00:01:46.409> up<00:01:46.560> right<00:01:46.740> now<00:01:46.860> there's<00:01:47.130> no<00:01:47.310> weight<00:01:47.460> on

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
Jeep up right now there's no weight on

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.929 
Jeep up right now there's no weight on
them<00:01:50.299> that's<00:01:51.299> max<00:01:51.600> for<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.649> suspension<00:01:53.490> setup

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
them that's max for the suspension setup

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.950 
them that's max for the suspension setup
that<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.360> get<00:01:54.600> from<00:01:54.829> the<00:01:55.829> long<00:01:56.009> arm<00:01:56.130> kit<00:01:56.369> I

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
that you get from the long arm kit I

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.310 
that you get from the long arm kit I
think<00:01:57.960> it's<00:01:58.049> pretty<00:01:58.170> good<00:01:58.350> though<00:02:00.259> it's<00:02:01.259> a

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
think it's pretty good though it's a

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.670 
think it's pretty good though it's a
pretty<00:02:01.770> decent<00:02:02.159> amount<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.490> flex<00:02:03.350> you<00:02:04.350> know<00:02:04.469> I

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
pretty decent amount of flex you know I

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.130 
pretty decent amount of flex you know I
mean<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.880> could<00:02:06.030> always<00:02:06.180> use<00:02:06.390> more<00:02:06.420> flex<00:02:06.899> but

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
mean you could always use more flex but

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.160 
mean you could always use more flex but
I<00:02:07.409> think<00:02:08.399> that's<00:02:08.550> pretty<00:02:08.759> good<00:02:08.879> from<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:12.170> $1,500

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
I think that's pretty good from a $1,500

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.310 
I think that's pretty good from a $1,500
