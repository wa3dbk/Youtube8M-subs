00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
top so again you're going to get one to

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.190 
top so again you're going to get one to
two<00:03:09.250> inches<00:03:09.730> I<00:03:09.940> have<00:03:10.450> actually<00:03:10.750> taken<00:03:10.900> my

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
two inches I have actually taken my

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.140 
two inches I have actually taken my
glove<00:03:11.470> off<00:03:11.680> now<00:03:11.950> to<00:03:12.040> do<00:03:12.250> this<00:03:12.370> top<00:03:12.610> section<00:03:12.820> I

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
glove off now to do this top section I

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.390 
glove off now to do this top section I
take<00:03:13.450> extra<00:03:13.960> care<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.590> reason<00:03:14.710> being<00:03:15.130> is<00:03:15.340> that

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
take extra care the reason being is that

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.490 
take extra care the reason being is that
I<00:03:15.550> find<00:03:15.880> that<00:03:16.030> I<00:03:16.090> get<00:03:16.240> a<00:03:16.300> better<00:03:16.570> grip<00:03:16.959> with<00:03:17.260> my

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
I find that I get a better grip with my

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.080 
I find that I get a better grip with my
fingers<00:03:17.980> I<00:03:18.100> know<00:03:18.130> a<00:03:18.280> couple<00:03:18.550> of<00:03:18.700> other<00:03:18.790> people

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
fingers I know a couple of other people

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.120 
fingers I know a couple of other people
that<00:03:19.270> do<00:03:19.510> this<00:03:19.540> as<00:03:19.810> well<00:03:19.959> I<00:03:20.200> don't<00:03:20.470> know<00:03:20.950> why<00:03:21.100> I

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
that do this as well I don't know why I

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.590 
that do this as well I don't know why I
find<00:03:21.459> it<00:03:21.640> easier<00:03:21.880> I<00:03:21.910> really<00:03:22.240> think<00:03:22.450> it's<00:03:22.540> just

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
find it easier I really think it's just

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.140 
find it easier I really think it's just
the<00:03:22.870> grip<00:03:23.080> so<00:03:23.500> I<00:03:23.530> go<00:03:23.770> really<00:03:24.160> really<00:03:24.580> carefully

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
the grip so I go really really carefully

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.520 
the grip so I go really really carefully
on<00:03:25.270> the<00:03:25.360> top<00:03:25.570> to<00:03:25.720> make<00:03:25.870> sure<00:03:25.930> that<00:03:26.260> I<00:03:26.290> don't

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
on the top to make sure that I don't

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.890 
on the top to make sure that I don't
burn<00:03:26.770> my<00:03:27.190> hand<00:03:27.459> so<00:03:28.030> again<00:03:28.300> I'm<00:03:28.450> just<00:03:28.660> wrapping
