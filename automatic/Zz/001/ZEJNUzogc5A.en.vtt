00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.640
 I can not so many times surprised that I even 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:10.030
 can't imagine what song you chose for 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.969
 today's holiday battle was a song 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.309
 you know we love new year 8 very much 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.890
 March all holidays but now we felt 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.530
 what is the most important most important holiday 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.890
 for our people , after all, this is May 9 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.780
 because while we remember May 9th we will 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.760
 live no one will tear us up because 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.240
 this is our cementing holiday 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.680
 societies I think that especially the city 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.840
 Leningrad survived many other cities 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.520
 we decided to war that day 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.370
 remember how own millions of people 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.230
 who on the feast at the table remember 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.110
 such great songs as dark night 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.620
 which was seems in forty eighth 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.810
 the year came out in the movie two fighters and 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:57.940
 happiness that we have this 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:59.420
 opportunity to perform this song close 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.019
 and St. Petersburg 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.920
 hellish area in all supports its 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:10.090
 the choir is only here home but only with the victory 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.090
 attention to the screen 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:21.490
 maxim look faster he shows you 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:24.270
 one she see worth our performance 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.250
 bark we like the most with us 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.650
 Grandma is not very friendly with technology 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.410
 she even learned how to send sms 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.030
 Granny, of course, and vegetables 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.240
 very worried 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.880
 and I'm glad for them that they want to somehow 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.360
 raise our spirits when and hard songs 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:47.440
 helping the war was from a hard time 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.080
 there was an airplane flying above us above us 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.509
 that's just to touch the head all in the underground 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.259
 going going going into a cellar with 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.619
 accordion 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.960
 we sing like there is never anything anywhere 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.530
 like nowhere nobody shoots anything 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.729
 we sing songs any song our military 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:10.679

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.679
 curls or good we care pepe 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.780
 if the war years are soaked with some kind of load 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.870
 to joy when every second of life 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.340
 this is hope when every news 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.900

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:01.100

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.100
