let's check it out so there's four basic

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.789 
let's check it out so there's four basic
controls<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.670> thing<00:01:53.880> we've<00:01:54.180> got<00:01:54.420> our

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
controls on this thing we've got our

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.749 
controls on this thing we've got our
output<00:01:55.799> volume<00:01:55.979> we're<00:01:56.310> just<00:01:56.430> going<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.579> leave

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
output volume we're just going to leave

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.330 
output volume we're just going to leave
that<00:01:56.790> where<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.770> we've<00:01:58.770> got<00:01:58.799> our<00:01:59.009> two<00:01:59.130> band

EQ bass and treble and here's our fab

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.160 
EQ bass and treble and here's our fab
dial<00:02:04.280> fab<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.640> your<00:02:06.540> distortion<00:02:07.140> level

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
dial fab is your distortion level

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.520 
dial fab is your distortion level
it's<00:02:10.630> ridiculously<00:02:11.630> intense<00:02:11.960> there's<00:02:12.260> like

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
it's ridiculously intense there's like

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.100 
it's ridiculously intense there's like
there's<00:02:13.280> no<00:02:13.459> real<00:02:13.730> off<00:02:13.970> even<00:02:14.720> if<00:02:14.810> you<00:02:14.870> have<00:02:14.990> it

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
there's no real off even if you have it

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.020 
there's no real off even if you have it

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
all the way down it's still more intense

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.090 
all the way down it's still more intense
than<00:02:17.180> most<00:02:17.540> pedals<00:02:17.870> let's<00:02:18.530> just<00:02:18.740> listen<00:02:18.890> to

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
than most pedals let's just listen to

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:28.290 
than most pedals let's just listen to
the<00:02:19.490> clean<00:02:19.700> signal<00:02:20.000> here<00:02:20.270> first

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:41.559 

and<00:02:29.300> now<00:02:29.780> let's<00:02:30.080> engage<00:02:30.770> it

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.470 

now<00:02:42.769> fab<00:02:43.769> here<00:02:44.370> it's<00:02:44.819> kind<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.000> hard<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.239> tell

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
now fab here it's kind of hard to tell

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.149 
now fab here it's kind of hard to tell
because<00:02:45.659> it's<00:02:46.170> pedal<00:02:46.379> a<00:02:46.409> little<00:02:46.440> bit<00:02:46.680> up<00:02:46.769> but

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
because it's pedal a little bit up but

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:48.710 
because it's pedal a little bit up but
you<00:02:47.220> see<00:02:47.370> it's<00:02:47.489> this<00:02:48.060> is<00:02:48.180> on<00:02:48.269> like<00:02:48.390> a<00:02:48.450> third<00:02:48.659> of

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
you see it's this is on like a third of

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.390 
you see it's this is on like a third of
the<00:02:48.810> way<00:02:48.870> up<00:02:48.900> let's<00:02:49.739> turn<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:50.010> all<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.129> way<00:02:50.220> off

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
the way up let's turn it all the way off

00:02:50.400 --> 00:03:02.800 
the way up let's turn it all the way off
or<00:02:50.640> all<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.510> way<00:02:51.540> down

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.090 

that's<00:03:03.800> what<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.010> effect<00:03:04.250> all<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.640> way<00:03:04.760> off<00:03:04.970> I

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
that's what the effect all the way off I

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.890 
that's what the effect all the way off I
mean<00:03:07.100> all<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.580> way<00:03:07.670> up<00:03:07.820> it's<00:03:08.000> just<00:03:08.090> like<00:03:08.300> the

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
mean all the way up it's just like the

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.060 
mean all the way up it's just like the
feedback<00:03:09.260> is<00:03:09.440> just<00:03:09.470> you<00:03:10.190> can't<00:03:10.660> control<00:03:12.070> yeah

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
feedback is just you can't control yeah

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.700 
feedback is just you can't control yeah
there<00:03:13.550> we<00:03:13.640> go<00:03:13.760> so<00:03:14.360> let's<00:03:14.660> right<00:03:15.080> about<00:03:15.260> here<00:03:15.560> is

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
there we go so let's right about here is

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.600 
there we go so let's right about here is
we're<00:03:15.890> sort<00:03:16.130> of<00:03:16.220> like<00:03:16.370> our<00:03:16.580> usable<00:03:17.000> level<00:03:17.300> is

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
we're sort of like our usable level is

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.140 
we're sort of like our usable level is
here's<00:03:19.610> our<00:03:19.790> base<00:03:20.740> EQ<00:03:21.740> right<00:03:21.950> here<00:03:22.130> all<00:03:22.880> the

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
here's our base EQ right here all the

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.410 
here's our base EQ right here all the
way<00:03:23.240> down<00:03:27.670> it<00:03:28.670> almost<00:03:28.850> sounds<00:03:29.150> like<00:03:29.270> one<00:03:29.390> of

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
way down it almost sounds like one of

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.199 
way down it almost sounds like one of
those<00:03:29.890> cigarette<00:03:30.890> box<00:03:31.130> distortions<00:03:31.850> so<00:03:32.180> I

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
those cigarette box distortions so I

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:41.210 
those cigarette box distortions so I
mean<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.540> cigarette<00:03:32.840> box<00:03:33.050> amps

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.190 

Oh

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
Oh

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:57.730 
Oh
we<00:03:44.200> have<00:03:44.379> the<00:03:44.530> base<00:03:44.709> up

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.190 

it's<00:03:58.400> actually<00:03:58.670> this<00:03:58.880> EQ<00:03:59.480> control<00:03:59.810> right<00:03:59.990> here

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
it's actually this EQ control right here

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.500 
it's actually this EQ control right here
that<00:04:00.380> makes<00:04:00.650> it<00:04:00.920> such<00:04:01.400> a<00:04:01.430> good<00:04:01.760> bass<00:04:02.150> fuzz

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
that makes it such a good bass fuzz

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.180 
that makes it such a good bass fuzz
pedal<00:04:02.990> we<00:04:03.380> will<00:04:03.590> take<00:04:03.770> a<00:04:03.800> listen<00:04:04.010> to<00:04:04.130> that

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
pedal we will take a listen to that

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.490 
pedal we will take a listen to that
later<00:04:07.720> okay<00:04:08.720> let's<00:04:08.900> just<00:04:09.020> bring<00:04:09.170> it<00:04:09.290> to<00:04:09.350> about

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
later okay let's just bring it to about

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
twelve o'clock here's our treble control

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:17.860 
twelve o'clock here's our treble control
it's<00:04:11.390> pretty<00:04:11.690> far<00:04:12.050> down<00:04:12.260> right<00:04:12.530> now<00:04:16.780> when<00:04:17.780> it

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
attack sound this kind of dials in

00:04:50.120 --> 00:05:00.610 
attack sound this kind of dials in
exactly<00:04:50.690> that

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.600

but<00:05:14.710> you<00:05:15.550> know<00:05:15.639> it's<00:05:15.850> not<00:05:16.030> the<00:05:16.240> most<00:05:17.250> versatile

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
but you know it's not the most versatile

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.640 
but you know it's not the most versatile
sounding<00:05:18.970> pedal<00:05:19.330> I<00:05:19.449> mean<00:05:19.630> there's<00:05:19.930> this<00:05:20.470> is

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
sounding pedal I mean there's this is

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.749 
sounding pedal I mean there's this is
off<00:05:20.830> this<00:05:21.310> is<00:05:23.550> that's<00:05:24.550> the<00:05:24.759> yeah<00:05:25.599> anyway<00:05:25.960> so

off this is that's the yeah anyway so
but<00:05:27.759> I<00:05:27.819> mean<00:05:28.060> it<00:05:28.180> sounds<00:05:28.449> huge<00:05:28.630> and<00:05:28.900> it<00:05:29.169> sounds

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
but I mean it sounds huge and it sounds

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.900 
but I mean it sounds huge and it sounds
pretty<00:05:29.560> cool<00:05:29.800> for<00:05:30.069> the<00:05:30.220> one<00:05:30.400> sort<00:05:30.699> of<00:05:30.759> like
