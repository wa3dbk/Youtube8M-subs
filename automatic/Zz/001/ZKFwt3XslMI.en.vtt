pattern going on in the middle of the
soul<00:02:00.110> which<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.470> guess<00:02:01.830> we<00:02:02.100> Paul<00:02:02.340> Gilbert<00:02:02.580> fans

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.770 
that's then is where he changed and this
is<00:03:52.210> okay

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.300 

but<00:03:55.780> you<00:03:55.870> don't<00:03:56.050> want<00:03:56.170> to<00:03:56.230> stick<00:03:56.470> in<00:03:56.680> in<00:03:57.040> that

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
but you don't want to stick in in that

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.560 
but you don't want to stick in in that
second<00:03:57.730> part<00:03:57.910> you<00:03:58.060> don't<00:03:58.150> want<00:03:58.330> to<00:03:58.390> stick

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
second part you don't want to stick

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:06.720 
second part you don't want to stick
around<00:03:58.690> there<00:03:59.050> too<00:03:59.200> long<00:04:05.430> according<00:04:06.430> to<00:04:06.550> Paul

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
around there too long according to Paul

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:14.430 
around there too long according to Paul
it's<00:04:06.910> quite<00:04:07.090> nightmarish<00:04:12.720> so<00:04:13.720> he<00:04:13.840> stays<00:04:14.170> there

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
it's quite nightmarish so he stays there

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.289 
it's quite nightmarish so he stays there
for<00:04:14.739> the<00:04:14.920> shortest<00:04:15.370> amount<00:04:15.489> of<00:04:15.760> time<00:04:15.820> just

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299

for the shortest amount of time just
plays<00:04:16.840> one

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.500

thing together let's see if that makes

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:54.760 
thing together let's see if that makes
more<00:04:37.430> sense
