00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
their life and experience I think God is

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.729 
their life and experience I think God is
active<00:02:57.000> in<00:02:57.239> people<00:02:57.720> but<00:02:58.140> because<00:02:58.320> of<00:02:58.650> the

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
active in people but because of the

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.630 
active in people but because of the
distractions<00:02:59.459> of<00:02:59.579> contemporary<00:03:00.120> life<00:03:00.329> people

can't hear or see God and so I think
church<00:03:04.680> is<00:03:04.709> a<00:03:04.859> place<00:03:05.130> where<00:03:05.280> we<00:03:05.430> try<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:05.700> strip

for or taught anything it was that I

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.670 
for or taught anything it was that I

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
think that there are people to whom God

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.380 
think that there are people to whom God
seems<00:03:34.160> to<00:03:34.250> be<00:03:34.400> speaking<00:03:34.610> and<00:03:34.970> there<00:03:35.209> are<00:03:35.299> other

people<00:03:35.660> who<00:03:35.930> seem<00:03:36.319> not<00:03:36.680> to<00:03:36.709> be<00:03:37.069> hearing<00:03:37.310> that<00:03:37.580> I

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
people who seem not to be hearing that I

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.180 
people who seem not to be hearing that I
think<00:03:38.840> also<00:03:39.019> people<00:03:39.470> are<00:03:39.530> turning<00:03:39.860> away<00:03:39.980> from

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
think also people are turning away from

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.470 
think also people are turning away from
religion<00:03:40.640> largely<00:03:40.970> because<00:03:41.360> the

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
religion largely because the

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.110 
religion largely because the
institutional<00:03:42.170> church<00:03:42.410> has<00:03:43.400> lost<00:03:43.430> a<00:03:43.910> lot<00:03:44.060> of

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
its credibility they see institutional

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.250 
its credibility they see institutional
churches<00:03:46.760> as<00:03:47.090> characterized<00:03:47.659> by<00:03:47.840> a<00:03:47.870> kind<00:03:48.170> of

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
churches as characterized by a kind of

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.800 
churches as characterized by a kind of
hypocrisy<00:03:48.920> that<00:03:49.150> clergy<00:03:50.150> are<00:03:50.269> getting<00:03:50.540> up<00:03:50.660> and

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
hypocrisy that clergy are getting up and

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.420 
hypocrisy that clergy are getting up and
telling<00:03:51.049> them<00:03:51.260> to<00:03:51.290> live<00:03:51.500> one<00:03:51.739> way<00:03:51.920> and<00:03:52.250> then

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
telling them to live one way and then

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.920 
telling them to live one way and then
they<00:03:52.640> themselves<00:03:52.849> are<00:03:53.180> living<00:03:53.480> some<00:03:53.780> other

they themselves are living some other

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.190 
they themselves are living some other
way<00:03:54.129> so<00:03:55.129> I<00:03:55.160> think<00:03:55.489> part<00:03:55.790> of<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.030> job<00:03:56.299> of<00:03:56.690> the

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
way so I think part of the job of the

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.979 
way so I think part of the job of the
church<00:03:57.440> in<00:03:57.739> the<00:03:57.859> 21st<00:03:58.370> century<00:03:58.430> is<00:03:58.970> to<00:03:59.450> live

church in the 21st century is to live
its<00:04:00.260> life<00:04:00.349> with<00:04:00.799> kind<00:04:01.370> of<00:04:01.489> integrity<00:04:02.109> that

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
its life with kind of integrity that
