00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
redstone and as you can see that piston

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.850 
redstone and as you can see that piston
still<00:03:03.870> off<00:03:04.020> it's<00:03:04.260> supposed<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.590> be<00:03:04.710> like<00:03:04.800> that

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
still off it's supposed to be like that

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.830 
still off it's supposed to be like that
then<00:03:05.670> you<00:03:05.730> want<00:03:05.910> to<00:03:05.970> build<00:03:06.120> your<00:03:06.240> piston<00:03:06.660> door

it can be hooked up to anything to this
is<00:03:32.730> just<00:03:32.910> your<00:03:33.000> input<00:03:33.420> /<00:03:33.630> output<00:03:33.750> so<00:03:34.470> for

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
is just your input / output so for

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.050 
is just your input / output so for
example<00:03:34.710> it's<00:03:35.070> can<00:03:35.190> we<00:03:35.250> hook<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.610> I<00:03:35.640> don't<00:03:35.970> know

now<00:04:39.509> that<00:04:39.719> with<00:04:39.810> this<00:04:39.930> as<00:04:40.139> it<00:04:40.319> creates<00:04:40.409> a<00:04:40.560> delay

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
now that with this as it creates a delay

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.830 
now that with this as it creates a delay
circuit<00:04:41.250> allowing<00:04:41.669> it<00:04:41.789> to<00:04:41.969> be<00:04:42.240> activated<00:04:42.599> for

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
circuit allowing it to be activated for

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.290 
circuit allowing it to be activated for
a<00:04:42.930> long<00:04:43.080> period<00:04:43.259> of<00:04:43.439> time<00:04:43.969> so<00:04:44.969> now<00:04:45.090> we're<00:04:45.270> just

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
a long period of time so now we're just

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.800 
a long period of time so now we're just
going<00:04:45.449> to<00:04:45.599> hook<00:04:45.840> it<00:04:46.020> up<00:04:46.080> to<00:04:46.139> this<00:04:46.740> bottom<00:04:47.280> block

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
going to hook it up to this bottom block

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.619 
going to hook it up to this bottom block
right<00:04:48.810> here<00:04:49.340> which<00:04:50.340> that'll<00:04:50.669> act<00:04:50.879> deactivate

00:04:51.619 --> 00:04:51.629 
right here which that'll act deactivate

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:55.249 
right here which that'll act deactivate
that<00:04:51.659> torch<00:04:52.050> and<00:04:53.449> yeah<00:04:54.449> all<00:04:54.870> right<00:04:55.050> now<00:04:55.139> we're

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 
that torch and yeah all right now we're

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:57.050 
that torch and yeah all right now we're
just<00:04:55.289> going<00:04:55.409> to<00:04:55.560> try<00:04:56.009> to<00:04:56.069> get<00:04:56.610> back<00:04:56.759> in<00:04:56.909> here

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
just going to try to get back in here

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.779 
just going to try to get back in here
and<00:04:57.930> voila<00:04:58.530> there<00:04:58.889> you<00:04:59.039> go<00:04:59.190> so<00:04:59.460> now<00:04:59.580> when<00:04:59.729> you
