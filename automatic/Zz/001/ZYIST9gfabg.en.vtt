00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
you're on a long trip and if you recall

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.390 
you're on a long trip and if you recall
I<00:00:15.299> paid<00:00:15.719> particular<00:00:15.960> attention<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:17.039> those

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
I paid particular attention to those

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.550 
I paid particular attention to those
items<00:00:17.640> which<00:00:18.119> could<00:00:18.449> result<00:00:18.600> in<00:00:18.990> loss<00:00:19.260> of

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
engine oil and if you could recall I

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.870 
engine oil and if you could recall I
quickly<00:00:25.260> mentioned<00:00:25.890> about<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.369> radiator

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
quickly mentioned about the radiator

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.750 
quickly mentioned about the radiator
neck<00:00:27.349> but<00:00:28.349> but<00:00:28.710> this<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:29.189> important<00:00:29.699> I

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
neck but but this is so important I

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.279 
neck but but this is so important I
thought<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.090> would<00:00:30.300> be<00:00:30.420> good<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.630> come<00:00:30.929> back<00:00:30.960> to

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
thought it would be good to come back to

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.229 
thought it would be good to come back to
this<00:00:31.380> subject<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:32.009> actually<00:00:32.579> remove<00:00:33.000> the

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
this subject and actually remove the

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.360 
this subject and actually remove the
upper<00:00:33.329> hose<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.200> can<00:00:34.469> see<00:00:34.800> what<00:00:35.190> you

upper hose so you can see what you

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.670 
upper hose so you can see what you
should<00:00:35.579> be<00:00:35.700> inspecting<00:00:36.500> when<00:00:37.500> you're

me explain the old bare radiators are
the<00:02:51.540> most<00:02:51.720> prone<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.349> failure<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:52.890> think<00:02:53.400> by<00:02:53.790> the

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
the most prone to failure I think by the

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.270 
the most prone to failure I think by the
mid<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.840> late<00:02:55.019> 80s<00:02:55.440> they<00:02:55.739> started<00:02:56.069> figuring

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
mid to late 80s they started figuring

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.520 
mid to late 80s they started figuring
out<00:02:56.579> this<00:02:56.790> was<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:56.970> problem<00:02:57.269> and<00:02:57.629> some<00:02:58.349> of<00:02:58.470> these

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
out this was a problem and some of these

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.229 
out this was a problem and some of these
radiators<00:02:58.950> even<00:02:59.340> came<00:02:59.549> from<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.819> factory

of coolant or lack of engine coolant

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.539 
of coolant or lack of engine coolant
will<00:03:54.209> fatigue<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:54.900> plastic<00:03:55.410> you<00:03:55.950> have<00:03:55.980> the

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
will fatigue the plastic you have the

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.400 
will fatigue the plastic you have the
vibration<00:03:57.299> from<00:03:57.450> the<00:03:57.510> diesel<00:03:57.900> engine<00:03:58.230> which

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
vibration from the diesel engine which

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.920 
vibration from the diesel engine which
accelerates<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.400> problem<00:03:59.790> and<00:03:59.970> then<00:04:00.660> the

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
accelerates the problem and then the

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.539 
accelerates the problem and then the
narrow<00:04:01.200> hose<00:04:01.530> clamps<00:04:01.980> that<00:04:02.010> come<00:04:02.129> from<00:04:02.370> the

metal insert it spreads a load out and
by<00:04:10.319> using<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:10.949> wider<00:04:11.250> hose<00:04:11.549> clamp<00:04:11.910> it<00:04:12.150> even

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
by using the wider hose clamp it even

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.860 
by using the wider hose clamp it even
expands<00:04:13.470> a<00:04:13.590> load<00:04:13.769> further<00:04:14.160> so<00:04:14.940> even<00:04:15.269> if<00:04:15.389> the<00:04:15.599> if

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
expands a load further so even if the if

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.289 
expands a load further so even if the if
the<00:04:16.079> plastic<00:04:16.289> does<00:04:16.709> crack<00:04:17.099> you<00:04:17.849> have<00:04:17.880> this

the plastic does crack you have this

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.909 
the plastic does crack you have this
reinforcement<00:04:18.900> in<00:04:19.109> place<00:04:19.320> which<00:04:19.709> will

reinforcement in place which will

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.830 
reinforcement in place which will

the owner what I found here but I have a
hunch<00:04:25.770> they<00:04:26.070> probably<00:04:26.460> won't<00:04:26.849> even

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
hunch they probably won't even

hunch they probably won't even
fully<00:04:27.509> comprehend<00:04:28.229> the<00:04:28.979> type<00:04:29.219> of<00:04:29.400> disaster

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
fully comprehend the type of disaster

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.469 
fully comprehend the type of disaster
