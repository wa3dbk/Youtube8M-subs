 samir win against charleroi today 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.679
 unexpected performance for you 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.509
 probably your hair did not seem yet 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.460
 better than you do one came because you 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.490
 apparently not really expecting you though 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.170
 raid was immediately deep in all those suits 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.060
 wonderful income anyway at the mine 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.199
 message the how discussed the pad which 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.320
 phase with 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.539
 with the kinect rider and ruud swan thus 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.430
 in our opinion that if there is 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.280
 jewelry that he runs to the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.399
 right-hand side and I have those opinions 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.950
 follows and I have that opinion too 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.360
 arrested during the penalty series okay 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.340
 you don't have to grab a ball anyway 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.710
 always stressful for a do we go 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.950
 the that me ever i won it to 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.430
 cleared in advance and I think the 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.770
 third penalty it I sat here hebe 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.420
 but you can seaport our a bit one 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.920
 cheat in the toe about this is positive 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.420
 for us 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.390
 how do you prepare a mental to then 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.530
 Falling those periods is very very short 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.229
 in the dam trouble 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.180
 sit for a long time and him and spoke democritus 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.460
 there was such a moment comes democracy 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.580
 after-charge dribbling couch sits and was there 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.439
 I also next quarter now quarterfinals 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.810
 for the first time since the year we got the 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.229
 cup to the quarterfinals you have one 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.810
 preferred standard or genk oh all for me 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.869
 does n't really matter so much 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.280
 flowering sat pleasant antique muscles 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.990
 following match will follow you very briefly 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.090
 Saturday at home against beerschot 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.890
 competition again 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.530
 little rest days we prepare you for it 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.890
 contest we think everyone for 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.450
 tell them about it is my enoch home and 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.869
 take it easy tomorrow I think 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.689
 nice troops and then focusing on it 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.759
 stand on Saturday on HBO because they a 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.850
 very important it was for us back 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.490
 a line of victories by slow 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.049
 hopefully we will have to go for a long time 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.979
 fight to have your authorization to retrieve 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.600
 and hopefully 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.539
 script and that didn't change our clothes 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.460
 but well, I think that everyone 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.110
 will be motivated his father 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.880
 coach was very satisfied with the shown 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.640
 mentality he even found it positive 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.019
 that it was that way for you 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.239
 another type of discharge 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.459
 dressing or no that was actually 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.959
 continue until the last guess you saw 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.329
 the last find the extension to 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.560
 you were in the plug pot at the back 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.150
 well how a little anywhere 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.739
 sloppy and we take names with you 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.720
 risks 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:32.530
 ok that's all higher pay for us 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.480
 the problem with victory and playing 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.650
 invaders in it higher up in that 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.110
 victory grabbing that 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.880
 victory yet ultimately 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.430
 goes more than and then half a 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.079
 competition with ten men indeed out 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.239
 thank the and rollers also have is nothing 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.790
 better at a cabin why how do you bake 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.459
 and how the bank and that is also positive 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.920

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.220
