00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.920
 good afternoon dear friends in front of you 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.440
 new option 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.710
 small kitchen knife has been changed 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.860
 the form in general she became so sick 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.710
 traditional work traditional 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:20.279
 western knife regret me not about that 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:23.250
 samples of the previous batch have a pattern 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.680
 by which we did it and in general here 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.160
 he is like that 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.349
 a template it so let's say the first the first 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.950
 variant of the first iteration of this knife 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:39.059
 new kitchen in general it is clear that the form 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.660
 completely different now total length 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.430
 left about the same as it is not 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.390
 exchanged 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:51.239
 changed the ratio between the grip and 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:58.320
 blade side of the increase of the handle 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:01:01.559
 that is now the length of the blade somewhere 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.199
 ninety-three millimeters as it was almost 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.560
 that 10 millimeters that is significantly 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.070
 shorter on and changed steel 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.840
 now it's like you can see it a and 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.909
 b 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:21.090
 This previous batch was made from 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:23.220
 steel ats-34 few words literally me 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.070
 I will not be extended to my 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.430
 look at least for kitchen 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.160
 knives and maybe even you knives 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:37.530
 a and b are better than ats-34 for kitchen 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:39.960
 knives the advantage is that well 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.070
 firstly she has the best 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:47.000
 corrosion resistance in its second 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.000
 can be reduced 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.340
 thinner and sharpen under sharper 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:56.509
 angle that is it is very important for 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.929
 kitchen knife for exactly to 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:04.189
 there was a certain lightness and quality 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:08.690
 cut and well and sharpen much more 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:14.690
 acute and possible because of the fact that 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:16.970
 has a more conducive structure 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.019
 more sharp cutting edges than 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:26.019
 ats-34 that is, very small carbides 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:29.690
 small amount of carbide in general and what 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:31.760
 makes more steady gives more 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:37.099
 steady cutting edge thinner 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:40.060
 cutting edge and you can and his such a knife 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:42.380
 In general, the composition of a and b it can be finished 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.959
 it can be hardened somewhere in 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:49.420
 area 63 it will be normal for this 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:53.000
 steel until I did not succeed 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:03:00.109
 63 data somewhere around 5960 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.660
 knives as a minus of this steel and I was it 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:07.579
 for me she is for me she is more 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.639
 difficult in hardening because ats-34 is more 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.810
 clear and hardening 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:16.040
 i.e. more predictable result 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:23.220
 you can get this of course and was 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:25.170
 Well, sometimes it turns out more costly 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.410
 it is in quenching for me personally because 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.360
 what's more time more trying on 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.960
 hardening is necessary in order to 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:38.790
 get a good result as a result 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.870
 in the end, the great-grandson's exactly these 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.090
 here are the knives 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:49.070
 in general, all four of the alibi here we are 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:53.490
 these are average 2 and then both mangup and 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:56.160
 I think how Obola is called this 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:04:00.840
 coloring these two 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:03.600
 this is black mikarta black peppa that is 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:09.000
 paper mika what is the basis paper 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:12.440
 no flax not tarpaulins and so on from 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.870
 for example, not but there lead canvas 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.459
 Mikarta she differs absence 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:22.110
 such a pronounced pattern some 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.910
 there is no divorce there and so on 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.460
 here she gives such a black matte 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:31.130
 color is basically enough 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:34.230
 I like these two 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.150
 as if well, all they are all under the order 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:41.660
 only unfortunately free 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.660
 there is not one for example 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.910
 Such a yuber sand with his before was 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.850
 channel called now called by 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:56.920
 my tactical plus was mentioned 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:05:00.340
 titles and for him this very note 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:04.780
 was santoku's affair a long time ago 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:07.330
 but since he also ordered a small knife 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.400
 in principle, I did not send him 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.740
 waited until it is ready small but to 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.810
 Colors do not pay twice for shipping 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:20.110
 in general, so here's how it would be 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:21.400
 set of handles 1 well, in general, from one 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.040
 same material new same color 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:30.750
 Ie such as on horse and there is still 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:32.020
 one person well, too, yes, he, too, was waiting for both 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.210
 the knife 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.080
 how is he going to be that type too 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.080
 how naborchik 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:44.880
 in general, thank you for your attention bye
