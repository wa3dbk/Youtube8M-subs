00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.230
 That design is that 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.990
 At that time then 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.279
 That car 

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:15.039
 So what kind of car is that in the world that 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:16.609
 Send as that message 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.460
 I think it's something I'm going to do 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.579
 Speaking 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:21.569
 After all Subaru's Legacy Touring Wagon 

00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:25.329
 It is said that we learned well in the present age 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:30.389
 f It is a strong car if it is a firm car 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:31.749
 That 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:34.260
 One more thing has already been opened 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.090
 Get in the car 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.910
 It is a car that can be relieved and a word 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.150
 As it has been pointed out 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.320
 I have made up 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.320
 For example, if you read in the room space 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.620
 that 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.180
 Even if there was ever 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.800
 1. Hand in hand 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.800
 It will be fun 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.650
 In contrast to asking 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.060
 The car 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.280
 The time I traveled on was full 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.060
 Or at that time you can relax both physically and mentally 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.280
 felt 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.320
 Crash into car 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.390
 I'm thinking about realizing it in indoor space 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.050
 came 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.140
 So it's not just simply broad 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.810
 In various places 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.270
 Feelings are simple 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.080
 That room 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.130
 It collides with such a car that you can get 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.510
 Came 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.510
 What does it mean if you are in 8-4? 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.909
 Well in the era when the person who received the turbo received 280 horsepower 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.130
 if there is 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.250
 Ran fast 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.920
 I do not think that it was able to run fast because it can be 4. 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.280
 But what I want to offer in the current era is 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.360
 I was able to run comfortably and I feel like I will win 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.380
 I was able to run 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.620
 It was not early or late, and I was able to run as I expected 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.830
 We have developed such a car with a collision 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.010
 For each operation of steering or accelerator pedal 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.560
 10,000 barrels as I thought 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.590
 So you can enjoy the dialogue with the car 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.879
 It's a fulfilling time 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.169
 Leads to 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.879
 It was used as such a car 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.579
 This car is also very relaxing for long touring 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.969
 And that 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:20.459
 I can go with enough eco-friendly driving 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.319
 Because it is a car 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.790
 For example, if you ever had time for your love day 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.569
 I will go to Suko 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.199
 If it was the next car for things 

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:31.910
 I will do it a little further 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.639
 Let's try it 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:37.809
 I want to discover a new world where I'm getting away 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:40.959
 That's why I'm leading now 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.909
 I have not been to Korea but it seems 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:45.930
 roof 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:46.900
 By any means 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.179
 It is Hanshin 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:50.059
 Myself too 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:52.629
 Find the horse racing time in front 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.819
 Let's go former anonymity 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.659
 Maybe where I have never been 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.419
 Maa's 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:01.949
 It is planned more and more steadily from the day before mma 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:03.339
 On that morning 

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:05.649
 I think I'll go until I can reach you even though I feel good today 

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:08.239
 Good sound was found when we were 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:09.160
 Return 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.269
 Oh, so good to go so far 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:12.640
 So that's that 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.150
 There was something appropriate that was written in the tourist guide 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.469
 Rather than 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:19.469
 Thanks to the calculation going to 100 km ahead 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:22.789
 I had an experience I did not think in the morning 

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:26.249
 I'm looking forward to thinking that I can do that
