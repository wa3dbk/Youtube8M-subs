oranges coming through and you can get
purples<00:01:51.930> as<00:01:52.140> well<00:01:52.460> now<00:01:53.460> because<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.600> colors

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
purples as well now because the colors

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.039 
purples as well now because the colors
are<00:01:55.140> not<00:01:55.439> easy<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.579> see<00:01:56.850> I've<00:01:57.420> got<00:01:57.630> some<00:01:57.869> dry

are not easy to see I've got some dry

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.280 
are not easy to see I've got some dry
ones<00:01:58.350> here<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:59.270> can<00:02:00.270> get<00:02:00.479> paler<00:02:00.720> ones<00:02:00.960> by<00:02:01.110> using

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
ones here I can get paler ones by using

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.760 
ones here I can get paler ones by using
more<00:02:01.590> water<00:02:01.619> with<00:02:02.159> your<00:02:02.340> paints<00:02:03.380> these<00:02:04.380> don't

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
more water with your paints these don't

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.550 
more water with your paints these don't
always<00:02:05.070> show<00:02:06.000> how<00:02:06.329> they're<00:02:06.570> going<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.990> look<00:02:07.259> on

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560
