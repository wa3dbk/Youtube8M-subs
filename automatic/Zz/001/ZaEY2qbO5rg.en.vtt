00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
basically ninety nine percent water I've

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.080 
basically ninety nine percent water I've
done<00:00:58.170> one<00:00:58.379> more<00:00:58.500> see<00:00:58.680> prior<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.489> this<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.940> was

ninety-five percent water if you guys
don't<00:01:02.129> believe<00:01:02.250> my<00:01:02.489> math<00:01:02.730> bust<00:01:03.480> out<00:01:03.629> a

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
don't believe my math bust out a

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.299 
don't believe my math bust out a
calculation<00:01:04.199> on<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.769> let<00:01:04.860> me<00:01:04.920> know<00:01:05.040> what

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
here's the coordinates 393 73 it's going

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.520 
here's the coordinates 393 73 it's going
to<00:02:00.960> take<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.520> nice<00:02:02.520> tumble<00:02:03.360> down<00:02:03.630> here<00:02:04.049> all

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
to take a nice tumble down here all

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.780 
to take a nice tumble down here all
right<00:02:04.649> let's<00:02:04.829> see<00:02:04.950> what<00:02:04.979> we're<00:02:05.219> doing<00:02:05.310> here<00:02:05.640> oh

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
right let's see what we're doing here oh

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.980 
right let's see what we're doing here oh
yeah<00:02:06.719> that's<00:02:06.930> right<00:02:07.049> it's<00:02:07.229> sand

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
yeah that's right it's sand

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.229 
yeah that's right it's sand
so<00:02:08.830> this<00:02:09.130> dis<00:02:09.310> water<00:02:09.520> in<00:02:09.700> here<00:02:09.819> probably<00:02:10.030> will

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
so this dis water in here probably will

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:11.339 
so this dis water in here probably will
not<00:02:10.360> be<00:02:10.539> here<00:02:10.810> I<00:02:10.869> think<00:02:11.140> I<00:02:11.170> might<00:02:11.319> have
