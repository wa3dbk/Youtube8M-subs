you need to add more control into your
views<00:00:42.590> in<00:00:43.590> here<00:00:44.070> we<00:00:44.489> can<00:00:44.670> typically<00:00:45.120> work<00:00:45.329> in

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
views in here we can typically work in

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.549 
views in here we can typically work in
the<00:00:45.629> same<00:00:45.870> way<00:00:45.899> as<00:00:46.140> we<00:00:46.260> have<00:00:46.410> done

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the same way as we have done

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.260 
the same way as we have done
traditionally<00:00:46.770> by<00:00:47.579> going<00:00:47.850> around<00:00:48.059> and

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
traditionally by going around and

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.080 
traditionally by going around and
selecting<00:00:48.780> our<00:00:48.930> targets<00:00:49.379> manually<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.910> I'm

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
selecting our targets manually so I'm

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.029 
selecting our targets manually so I'm
just<00:00:51.300> going<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.449> select<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:52.020> couple<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.739> views

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
just going to select a couple of views

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.010 
just going to select a couple of views
in<00:00:53.250> each<00:00:53.760> one<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.149> these<00:00:54.329> or<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> couple<00:00:54.899> of

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
in each one of these or a couple of

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.410 
in each one of these or a couple of
spheres<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.530> each<00:00:55.680> one<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:56.010> these<00:00:56.129> views<00:00:56.550> then

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
spheres in each one of these views then

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.330 
spheres in each one of these views then
what<00:00:57.629> I'm<00:00:57.750> going<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:57.989> do<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.500> utilizing<00:00:59.219> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
what I'm going to do is utilizing the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.189 
what I'm going to do is utilizing the
system<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.969> go<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.510> force<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
system is go in and force the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.460 
system is go in and force the
correspondence<00:01:01.949> between<00:01:02.039> known<00:01:02.670> points<00:01:03.470> so

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
correspondence between known points so

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.649 
correspondence between known points so
that's<00:01:04.710> two<00:01:05.070> common<00:01:05.670> spheres<00:01:06.000> between<00:01:06.479> each

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
that's two common spheres between each

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.740 
that's two common spheres between each
and<00:01:07.020> as<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.500> can<00:01:07.619> see<00:01:07.680> we've<00:01:08.520> got<00:01:08.549> spheres<00:01:09.420> in

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
and as you can see we've got spheres in

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.200 
and as you can see we've got spheres in
the<00:01:09.869> order<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.200> we<00:01:10.380> selected<00:01:10.950> them<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.310> close

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
the order that we selected them I close

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.050 
the order that we selected them I close
down<00:01:12.240> these<00:01:12.869> views<00:01:13.320> now<00:01:13.530> we<00:01:14.460> have<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> new<00:01:14.909> icon

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
down these views now we have a new icon

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.120 
down these views now we have a new icon

here<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.740> automatically<00:01:51.350> modified<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.530> name

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
here is automatically modified the name

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.069 
here is automatically modified the name
of<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.100> spheres<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.850> it's<00:01:54.509> linked<00:01:54.930> them

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
of the spheres and it's linked them

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.600 
of the spheres and it's linked them
together<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.649> it's<00:01:55.799> given<00:01:56.130> them<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.399> same

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
together so it's given them the same

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.569 
together so it's given them the same
name<00:01:57.770> there's<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.890> couple<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.250> things<00:01:59.340> to

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
name there's a couple of things to

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.590 
name there's a couple of things to
notice<00:01:59.960> firstly<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.229> green<00:02:01.500> sea<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.460> a

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
notice firstly the green sea is a

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.359 
notice firstly the green sea is a
correspondence<00:02:03.600> between<00:02:03.950> targets<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.189> each

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
appear firstly we can find

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.050 
appear firstly we can find
correspondence<00:02:31.740> between<00:02:31.860> scans<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:32.880> the

corresponding targets in each view and
it<00:03:05.280> physically<00:03:05.760> forces<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.600> correspondence

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
it physically forces the correspondence

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.110 
it physically forces the correspondence
now<00:03:08.070> you'll<00:03:08.220> notice<00:03:08.580> that<00:03:08.730> in<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:08.970> background

I've<00:03:14.220> got<00:03:14.340> a<00:03:14.370> blue<00:03:14.700> correspondent<00:03:15.510> sphere

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
I've got a blue correspondent sphere

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.280 
I've got a blue correspondent sphere
what<00:03:17.310> it's<00:03:17.459> telling<00:03:17.790> me<00:03:17.820> that<00:03:17.940> it's<00:03:18.330> forced

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
what it's telling me that it's forced

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.170 
what it's telling me that it's forced
the<00:03:19.380> correspondence<00:03:19.980> between<00:03:20.100> these<00:03:20.489> two<00:03:20.790> but

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
the correspondence between these two but

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.210 
the correspondence between these two but
in<00:03:21.300> doing<00:03:21.480> so<00:03:21.630> it's<00:03:21.959> also<00:03:22.230> found<00:03:22.620> or<00:03:22.860> other

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
in doing so it's also found or other

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.970 
in doing so it's also found or other
correspondences<00:03:24.120> in<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.420> view<00:03:24.660> if<00:03:25.560> I<00:03:25.650> want<00:03:25.860> to

correspondences in the view if I want to

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.160 
correspondences in the view if I want to
force<00:03:26.310> them<00:03:26.550> all<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:26.940> can<00:03:27.360> literally<00:03:27.570> force<00:03:27.959> the

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
force them all I can literally force the

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
correspondence between each as we then

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.590 
correspondence between each as we then
work<00:03:31.170> around<00:03:31.489> we<00:03:32.489> can<00:03:32.670> use<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.090> traditional

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
work around we can use the traditional

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.070 
work around we can use the traditional
tools<00:03:33.840> to<00:03:34.680> go<00:03:34.800> around<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:35.160> highlight

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
tools to go around and highlight

additional<00:03:37.080> spheres<00:03:37.410> within<00:03:37.800> the<00:03:37.920> views<00:03:38.690> so

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
additional spheres within the views so

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.300 
additional spheres within the views so
I've<00:03:40.050> got<00:03:40.230> a<00:03:40.260> couple<00:03:40.470> more<00:03:40.709> in<00:03:40.860> here<00:03:41.100> I'm<00:03:41.280> just

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
I've got a couple more in here I'm just

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.830 
I've got a couple more in here I'm just
going<00:03:41.550> to<00:03:41.640> select<00:03:41.790> manually<00:03:42.300> very<00:03:42.570> quickly

add<00:03:58.920> that<00:03:58.950> what<00:03:59.370> we're<00:03:59.519> doing<00:03:59.760> here<00:03:59.970> is<00:04:00.090> we're

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
add that what we're doing here is we're

add that what we're doing here is we're
working<00:04:00.510> in<00:04:00.600> a<00:04:00.660> quick<00:04:01.019> view<00:04:01.260> so<00:04:02.130> it<00:04:02.790> just<00:04:03.000> makes

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
working in a quick view so it just makes

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.840 
working in a quick view so it just makes
the<00:04:03.450> navigation<00:04:04.110> a<00:04:04.320> lot<00:04:04.560> quicker<00:04:04.890> for<00:04:05.280> you<00:04:05.430> if

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
the navigation a lot quicker for you if

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.170 
the navigation a lot quicker for you if
you<00:04:06.180> weren't<00:04:06.360> used<00:04:06.630> to<00:04:06.750> using<00:04:07.050> it<00:04:08.030> once<00:04:09.030> I've

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
now I need to link scene 6 to scene 5 to

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.659 
now I need to link scene 6 to scene 5 to
get<00:04:33.720> it<00:04:33.840> into<00:04:34.110> the<00:04:34.380> view<00:04:34.620> I<00:04:34.800> literally<00:04:35.430> drag

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
get it into the view I literally drag

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.470 
get it into the view I literally drag
and<00:04:36.120> drop<00:04:36.330> it<00:04:36.510> into<00:04:36.630> my<00:04:36.900> chosen<00:04:37.139> window<00:04:37.590> and

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
and drop it into my chosen window and

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.760 
and drop it into my chosen window and
then<00:04:39.480> it's<00:04:39.630> just<00:04:39.810> a<00:04:39.930> case<00:04:40.110> of<00:04:40.169> working<00:04:40.710> around

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
then it's just a case of working around

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.860 
then it's just a case of working around
and<00:04:41.639> identifying<00:04:42.270> mice<00:04:42.450> fears<00:04:44.570> as<00:04:45.570> we<00:04:45.720> did

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
and identifying mice fears as we did

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.040 
and identifying mice fears as we did
before<00:04:46.430> as<00:04:47.430> we've<00:04:47.669> done<00:04:47.790> a<00:04:47.820> couple<00:04:48.060> it<00:04:48.600> starts

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
before as we've done a couple it starts

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.170 
before as we've done a couple it starts
to<00:04:49.200> link<00:04:49.440> those<00:04:49.620> in<00:04:49.650> two<00:04:49.980> previous

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
to link those in two previous

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.310 
to link those in two previous
correspondences<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:51.480> as<00:04:51.960> I've<00:04:52.080> already

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
correspondences and as I've already

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.020 
correspondences and as I've already
shown<00:04:52.590> in<00:04:52.980> your<00:04:53.130> tree<00:04:53.340> on<00:04:53.370> the<00:04:53.580> left<00:04:53.760> you'll

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
shown in your tree on the left you'll

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.240 
shown in your tree on the left you'll
start<00:04:54.360> to<00:04:54.480> rename<00:04:54.900> them<00:04:55.139> so<00:04:55.590> everything<00:04:56.040> has

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
start to rename them so everything has

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.850 
start to rename them so everything has
the<00:04:56.280> same<00:04:56.460> name<00:04:57.260> now<00:04:58.260> when<00:04:58.440> we<00:04:58.530> come<00:04:58.680> to<00:04:58.800> this

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
the same name now when we come to this

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:59.720 
the same name now when we come to this
one<00:04:59.040> on<00:04:59.190> the<00:04:59.280> floor

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
one on the floor

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.460 
one on the floor
it<00:05:00.210> should<00:05:00.360> automatically<00:05:00.870> pick<00:05:01.139> up<00:05:01.290> a

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
it should automatically pick up a

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.830 
it should automatically pick up a
correspondence<00:05:02.160> which<00:05:02.520> it<00:05:02.729> has<00:05:02.880> done<00:05:03.150> so<00:05:03.690> it's

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
correspondence which it has done so it's

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.270 
correspondence which it has done so it's
located<00:05:04.350> it<00:05:04.560> back<00:05:04.860> to<00:05:05.520> scene<00:05:05.729> five<00:05:06.090> as<00:05:06.630> well

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
located it back to scene five as well

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.740 
located it back to scene five as well
again<00:05:08.280> when<00:05:09.060> we're<00:05:09.210> happy<00:05:09.389> with<00:05:09.690> the

again when we're happy with the
correspondence<00:05:10.590> and<00:05:10.800> we<00:05:10.860> know<00:05:11.040> we've<00:05:11.220> got

everything<00:05:11.639> in<00:05:11.940> place<00:05:12.150> we<00:05:12.990> force<00:05:13.290> the

everything in place we force the

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.350 
everything in place we force the
correspondence<00:05:14.220> between<00:05:14.370> the<00:05:14.760> shown<00:05:14.970> scans

have five correspondences this would
