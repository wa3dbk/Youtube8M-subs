but the first fan and this word is where

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.700 
but the first fan and this word is where
it<00:00:32.940> gets<00:00:33.090> interesting<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.809> he's<00:00:34.320> holding<00:00:34.440> up

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
it gets interesting is he's holding up

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.450 
it gets interesting is he's holding up
an<00:00:34.829> R<00:00:35.130> that's<00:00:35.489> shaped<00:00:35.850> very<00:00:36.239> very<00:00:36.750> similar<00:00:37.079> to

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
an R that's shaped very very similar to

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.150 
an R that's shaped very very similar to
actually<00:00:38.460> identical<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.530> R<00:00:40.710> and

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
actually identical to the the R and

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.950 
actually identical to the the R and
Robins<00:00:41.879> logo<00:00:43.789> in<00:00:44.789> my<00:00:45.059> opinion<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.600> think<00:00:45.629> it's

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
Robins logo in my opinion I think it's

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.479 
Robins logo in my opinion I think it's
just<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.230> little<00:00:46.350> nod<00:00:46.649> at<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.980> character<00:00:47.370> of

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
just a little nod at the character of

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.610 
just a little nod at the character of
Robin<00:00:47.910> because<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.510> don't<00:00:49.020> think<00:00:49.230> Robins

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
Robin because I don't think Robins

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.150 
Robin because I don't think Robins
really<00:00:49.860> gonna<00:00:49.980> fit<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.370> with<00:00:50.550> Batman<00:00:51.649> I'm<00:00:52.649> not

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
even though he's only about 38 years old

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.539 
even though he's only about 38 years old
this<00:01:21.990> story<00:01:22.320> takes<00:01:22.500> place<00:01:22.619> eight<00:01:22.979> years<00:01:23.310> after

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
this story takes place eight years after

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.170 
this story takes place eight years after
the<00:01:23.670> Dark<00:01:23.970> Knight<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.380> think<00:01:25.850> just<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.000> is

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
the Dark Knight so I think just this is

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.090 
the Dark Knight so I think just this is
just<00:01:27.420> my<00:01:27.570> guess<00:01:27.600> my<00:01:28.080> prediction<00:01:28.590> but<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.770> think

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
just my guess my prediction but I think

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.940 
just my guess my prediction but I think
Bruce<00:01:30.000> Wayne<00:01:30.240> has<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.659> cane<00:01:30.900> because<00:01:31.619> does

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
Bruce Wayne has the cane because does

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.620 
Bruce Wayne has the cane because does
anyone<00:01:32.250> remember<00:01:32.430> how<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.820> Dark<00:01:33.060> Knight<00:01:33.210> ends

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
anyone remember how the Dark Knight ends

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.270 
anyone remember how the Dark Knight ends
I<00:01:33.810> mean<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> guy<00:01:34.200> falls<00:01:34.500> off<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:35.130> know<00:01:35.250> a

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
I mean the guy falls off a you know a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.670 
I mean the guy falls off a you know a
six<00:01:35.670> story<00:01:35.880> building<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.540> he<00:01:37.079> just<00:01:37.290> lands

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
six story building and he just lands

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.760 
six story building and he just lands
feet<00:01:37.950> first<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.490> maybe<00:01:38.729> he<00:01:39.320> he<00:01:40.320> broke<00:01:40.590> his

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
feet first so maybe he he broke his

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.520 
feet first so maybe he he broke his
tibia<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:42.240> then<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.689> trailer<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.229> cuts<00:01:43.409> to

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
tibia so then in the trailer it cuts to

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.280 
tibia so then in the trailer it cuts to
a<00:01:43.560> masquerade<00:01:44.220> party<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.720> party<00:01:46.110> we

and<00:02:33.690> what<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:33.900> think's<00:02:34.200> going<00:02:34.410> on<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:34.710> basically

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
and what I think's going on is basically

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.850 
and what I think's going on is basically
bangs<00:02:35.460> henchmen<00:02:36.060> are<00:02:36.330> invading<00:02:37.050> Gotham's

rich taking them and capturing them to

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.220 
rich taking them and capturing them to
do<00:02:41.430> what<00:02:41.670> with<00:02:41.850> we're<00:02:42.209> not<00:02:42.330> sure<00:02:42.570> yet<00:02:42.600> and<00:02:42.870> what

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
do what with we're not sure yet and what

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.780 
do what with we're not sure yet and what
really<00:02:43.440> backs<00:02:43.740> up<00:02:43.950> this<00:02:44.070> theory<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.490> in<00:02:44.700> the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
really backs up this theory is in the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.610 
really backs up this theory is in the
next<00:02:45.030> set<00:02:45.150> of<00:02:45.270> shots<00:02:45.450> we<00:02:45.930> see<00:02:46.110> this<00:02:46.260> kind<00:02:46.500> of

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
next set of shots we see this kind of

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.910 
next set of shots we see this kind of
very<00:02:46.920> inception<00:02:47.550> looking<00:02:48.360> prison<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.080> it's

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
very inception looking prison and it's

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.530 
very inception looking prison and it's
got<00:02:50.070> staircases<00:02:50.640> they're<00:02:51.000> all<00:02:51.060> weird<00:02:51.450> it

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
got staircases they're all weird it

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.760 
got staircases they're all weird it
doesn't<00:02:51.690> even<00:02:51.870> make<00:02:51.959> sense<00:02:52.020> what<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.470> stairs

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
doesn't even make sense what the stairs

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.770 
doesn't even make sense what the stairs
are<00:02:52.980> doing<00:02:53.250> in<00:02:53.370> this<00:02:53.520> in<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.910> set<00:02:54.270> but<00:02:54.300> anyway

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
are doing in this in the set but anyway

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.800 
are doing in this in the set but anyway
you<00:02:55.290> see<00:02:55.500> Bruce<00:02:56.010> Wayne<00:02:56.280> who's<00:02:56.489> now<00:02:56.790> in<00:02:56.820> rags<00:02:57.420> or

you see Bruce Wayne who's now in rags or

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.890 
you see Bruce Wayne who's now in rags or
I<00:02:58.020> guess<00:02:58.350> a<00:02:58.380> prison<00:02:58.860> uniform<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.640> he's<00:03:00.450> he

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
guess and then as Bane's hovering over

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.149 
guess and then as Bane's hovering over
him<00:04:09.000> looking<00:04:09.329> down<00:04:09.359> he<00:04:09.989> says<00:04:10.260> and<00:04:10.530> Gotham<00:04:10.950> is

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 
it looks dark it looks ominous and it

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:25.999 
it looks dark it looks ominous and it
looks<00:04:24.240> scary<00:04:24.690> it's<00:04:24.960> really<00:04:25.349> unsettling

what's<00:04:28.740> going<00:04:29.099> on<00:04:29.280> and<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.699> trailer<00:04:30.090> doesn't

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
what's going on and the trailer doesn't

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.089
