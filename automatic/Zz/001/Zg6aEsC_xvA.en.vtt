 of flying when it suggests an unusual ingredient after I planned for the 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.990
 recipes with sesame oil something like this happened and the other day I tried 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.450
 I'm rich so I share it with you in a bowl we put two 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.859
 tablespoons of oil 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.029

 we make sure that if he trains well and we booked him 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.420
 while we prepare the rest of the recipe in a pan we put a 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.420
 trickle of olive oil 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.860
 We've already seen feel fine minced 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.270
 and a clove of garlic also very chopped and this is going to take a while because 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.630
 we are going to leave the ginger of vinegar to a minimum more than garlic, 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.540
 about three four minutes I say fire loose while we're going to chop the onion 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.280
 tender 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.280

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.970
 this either does not or will need to leave much because these two raw ingredients 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.840
 They are rich and we will withdraw them as soon as they begin to become transparent. 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.210
 We put the noodles one coming back this time they are the Chinese noodles 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.260
 As you can see I'm not going to begin to see you, we withdraw from
