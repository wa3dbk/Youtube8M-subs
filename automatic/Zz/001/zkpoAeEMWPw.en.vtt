it and it completes my collection of

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.540 
it and it completes my collection of
something<00:00:19.080> you'd<00:00:19.949> probably<00:00:20.130> guess<00:00:20.340> what<00:00:20.460> it

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
something you'd probably guess what it

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.160 
something you'd probably guess what it
is<00:00:20.640> by<00:00:20.760> looking<00:00:20.910> at<00:00:21.119> these<00:00:21.270> these<00:00:21.750> are<00:00:21.810> the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
is by looking at these these are the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.359
