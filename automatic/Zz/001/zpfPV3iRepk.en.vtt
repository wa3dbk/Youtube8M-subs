00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.620
 no 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.890
 Now 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.500
 the veteran class with roberto cesareni 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.200
 of the championship an Italian major with 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.500
 this race you practically won the 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.140
 your category but we still have a race 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.690
 and I miss a few points now 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.200
 See you make the right accounts, however, we are 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.960
 good point 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.870
 we are almost hoping for today's race 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.860
 as was today's special tender 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:44.010
 all challenging in the first check 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:48.560
 that didn't leave you a breath and turn 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.560
 challenging worthy of the Bergamo area 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.790
 let's say they couldn't do it 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.490
 uphill trails had to do everything in 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.800
 descent but downhill demanding well 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.440
 ok see you at the last race since 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:05.190
 major September hello roberto hello thanks 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.210

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.210

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:12.030
 tell us something about the day 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:15.150
 the first line started immediately 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.630
 and I wanted to already boast me a little but instead 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:23.490
 After the blow they took ill 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:25.200
 European Saturday I immediately saw the exit 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.840
 that I was not well attracted then you have to 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.170
 part after special extreme we do a 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.180
 a little effort but not well 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.180
 we want to like driving 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.620
 we can't do now let's see the 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.000
 will still ranks as the 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.310
 classifies from what I could 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.359
 peek you're not hurt 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:53.579

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:56.680

00:03:53.579 --> 00:04:00.549
 to everyone else his place all 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:03.939
 well after the rest everything is fine around 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.019
 nice cute a little unpacked however by ha 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:08.950
 did what they could 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.489
 organizers and I am happy with 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.099
 to remain 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.139
 we will make the next race hopefully ok 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:19.030
 then see you next in pescara 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:20.789
 it seems to me less spending roisan okay 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.770
 let 's see there's a thousand thanks 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:27.699
 roberto bazzurri leaders of the former per 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:32.259
 two your today's race now let's say that 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:34.030
 I started not so aggressive I have 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:35.980
 tried to 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:40.630
 not to see the first lap 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:42.970
 it involved me and the bike 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.940
 I saw that in the end I was not 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.070
 far away for the absolute but I had to 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.730
 risk a lot to try to 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:54.250
 stay with them then first two instead 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:58.030
 I was pretty in my class 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:01.420
 quiet and I did my race without 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:05.410
 take too much risk there fine 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:08.530
 let's see the last race in your land 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:11.160
 we are almost the border between 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:15.300
 Tuscan brands 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:17.730
 it is a little closer so they are better suited 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.640
 the lands to my driving style 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.710
 ok see you September goes well in the mouth 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.560
 the wolf cracks big and with 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:29.010
 giorgio alberti of the motoclub coast 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:32.160
 volpino runs in the m1 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:36.930
 today's race was not a race 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:39.390
 let's say a little strange because practically 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.330
 the first checks were only special and 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:44.640
 special one in line to the other that you 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.960
 they put under the press let's say 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.360
 why not have a breather 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:52.350
 while the other check was a lot 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:58.220
 selective and without much special testing 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:58.220
 challenging past days 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:06.570
 you satisfied with your race we say 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.430
 yes I was well on the first lap I was 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.110
 second later I did a couple of things 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.930
 matteo lost some confidence in the 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:16.650
 second place is only the star iii sector 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:18.300
 see you there at the last race in your mouth 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.840

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.840
