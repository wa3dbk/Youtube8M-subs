00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
take right and this process is really

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.210 
take right and this process is really
hard<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.750> explain<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.439> you're<00:01:13.890> pretty<00:01:14.070> much

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
hard to explain so you're pretty much

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.359 
hard to explain so you're pretty much
just<00:01:14.549> going<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.909> have<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.030> watch<00:01:15.420> me<00:01:15.659> do<00:01:15.780> it

just going to have to watch me do it

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.090 
just going to have to watch me do it
because<00:01:17.369> it's<00:01:17.520> really<00:01:18.000> hard<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.240> explain<00:01:19.100> this

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
because it's really hard to explain this

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.860 
because it's really hard to explain this
is<00:01:20.310> how

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.370 

kind<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.620> flip<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.940> trigger<00:01:27.270> as<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.260> can

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
first and I know it looks kinda

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.790 
first and I know it looks kinda
ridiculous<00:01:45.450> at<00:01:45.900> first<00:01:45.930> because<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.470> have<00:01:46.590> all

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
ridiculous at first because you have all

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.040 
ridiculous at first because you have all
these<00:01:46.920> different<00:01:46.980> girls<00:01:47.520> but<00:01:47.910> at<00:01:48.150> the<00:01:48.300> end<00:01:48.330> we

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
these different girls but at the end we

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:57.790 
these different girls but at the end we
will<00:01:49.370> crush<00:01:50.370> them<00:01:50.430> all<00:01:50.730> together<00:01:55.820> and

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
will crush them all together and

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.610 
will crush them all together and
sometimes<00:01:58.800> if<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.760> see<00:02:00.030> like<00:02:00.240> right<00:02:00.480> here<00:02:00.960> it

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
sometimes if you see like right here it
