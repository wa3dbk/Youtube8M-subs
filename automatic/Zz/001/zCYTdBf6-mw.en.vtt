the outside town hall 8 town of late you

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.710 
the outside town hall 8 town of late you
do<00:03:07.739> get<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.010> drill<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:08.730> that<00:03:09.000> helps<00:03:09.239> a<00:03:09.360> bit<00:03:09.510> but

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
do get a drill so that helps a bit but

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.060 
do get a drill so that helps a bit but
I'm<00:03:09.840> you<00:03:09.930> still<00:03:10.140> got<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.350> be<00:03:10.410> able<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.650> farm<00:03:10.890> it

I'm you still got to be able to farm it
and<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:12.980> it's<00:03:13.980> not<00:03:14.160> only<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:14.580> can<00:03:14.700> probably

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
and and it's not only you can probably

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.310 
and and it's not only you can probably
your<00:03:15.480> troops<00:03:15.750> are<00:03:15.840> going<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.050> be<00:03:16.110> a<00:03:16.140> bit

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
your troops are going to be a bit

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.720 
your troops are going to be a bit
stronger<00:03:16.620> you<00:03:16.739> can<00:03:16.800> probably<00:03:17.070> break<00:03:17.400> into

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
stronger you can probably break into

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.880 
stronger you can probably break into
some<00:03:17.940> basis<00:03:18.299> like<00:03:18.450> this<00:03:18.660> one<00:03:18.840> easy<00:03:19.110> you

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
some basis like this one easy you

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.229 
some basis like this one easy you
definitely<00:03:20.160> get<00:03:20.370> in<00:03:20.489> this<00:03:20.580> one<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:20.790> do<00:03:20.910> a<00:03:21.000> whole

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
definitely get in this one I do a whole

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.759 
definitely get in this one I do a whole
six<00:03:21.450> troops<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.930> level<00:03:22.200> five<00:03:22.410> could<00:03:22.680> have

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
six troops the level five could have

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.890 
six troops the level five could have
gotten<00:03:23.070> into<00:03:23.370> this<00:03:23.489> base<00:03:23.730> easy<00:03:24.030> so<00:03:24.720> don't

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
gotten into this base easy so don't

with level 6 troops and it's not that

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.940 
with level 6 troops and it's not that
hard<00:04:18.299> as<00:04:18.660> long<00:04:18.720> as<00:04:19.019> you<00:04:19.079> get<00:04:19.200> clan<00:04:19.470> castle<00:04:19.709> out

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
hard as long as you get clan castle out

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.880 
hard as long as you get clan castle out
and<00:04:20.250> you<00:04:20.489> have<00:04:20.700> a<00:04:20.970> clear<00:04:21.930> and<00:04:22.380> you<00:04:22.560> know<00:04:22.830> you

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
and you have a clear and you know you

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.400 
and you have a clear and you know you

have a good path to get there so you can

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.870 
have a good path to get there so you can
use<00:04:25.560> my<00:04:25.770> my<00:04:26.099> my

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
use my my my

use my my my
raji<00:04:27.210> like<00:04:27.540> 12<00:04:27.930> Giants<00:04:28.350> 12<00:04:29.250> wall<00:04:29.610> breakers

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
raji like 12 Giants 12 wall breakers

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.390 
raji like 12 Giants 12 wall breakers
bunch<00:04:30.690> of<00:04:30.840> barbarians<00:04:31.110> archers<00:04:31.770> and<00:04:31.800> goblins

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
bunch of barbarians archers and goblins

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.300 
bunch of barbarians archers and goblins
just<00:04:32.670> split<00:04:32.970> those<00:04:33.150> up<00:04:33.180> evenly<00:04:34.070> it's<00:04:35.070> a<00:04:35.190> good

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
just split those up evenly it's a good

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.370 
just split those up evenly it's a good
strategy<00:04:35.520> so<00:04:36.150> I<00:04:36.180> mean<00:04:36.690> it<00:04:36.780> works<00:04:36.930> well<00:04:37.110> for<00:04:37.290> me

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
strategy so I mean it works well for me

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.900 
strategy so I mean it works well for me
i'm<00:04:37.530> showing<00:04:37.800> you<00:04:37.830> guys<00:04:37.920> right<00:04:38.250> now<00:04:38.280> but<00:04:38.760> them

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
i'm showing you guys right now but them

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.600 
i'm showing you guys right now but them
and<00:04:39.480> then<00:04:39.630> last<00:04:39.960> for<00:04:40.440> Channel<00:04:40.830> Ten's<00:04:41.160> getting

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
and then last for Channel Ten's getting

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.760 
and then last for Channel Ten's getting
dark<00:04:41.820> elixir<00:04:41.970> then<00:04:42.630> now<00:04:42.840> can<00:04:43.050> have<00:04:43.170> three<00:04:43.440> dark

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
dark elixir then now can have three dark

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.130 
dark elixir then now can have three dark
elixir<00:04:43.950> drills<00:04:44.400> that<00:04:45.000> can<00:04:45.180> all<00:04:45.360> be<00:04:45.390> level<00:04:45.840> six

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
elixir drills that can all be level six

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.310 
elixir drills that can all be level six
so<00:04:46.440> they<00:04:46.590> get<00:04:47.160> a<00:04:47.250> bunt<00:04:47.490> from<00:04:47.580> that<00:04:47.820> plus<00:04:48.320> there

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
so they get a bunt from that plus there

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.230 
so they get a bunt from that plus there
they<00:04:49.590> don't<00:04:49.680> get<00:04:49.830> any<00:04:50.010> stronger<00:04:50.370> troops<00:04:50.820> will

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
they don't get any stronger troops will

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.780 
they don't get any stronger troops will
any<00:04:51.420> stronger<00:04:51.870> tier<00:04:52.110> 1<00:04:52.350> troops<00:04:52.740> tier<00:04:53.550> 1<00:04:53.760> and

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
any stronger tier 1 troops tier 1 and

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.750 
any stronger tier 1 troops tier 1 and
tier<00:04:53.970> 2<00:04:54.270> so<00:04:54.720> that<00:04:55.470> doesn't<00:04:55.770> help<00:04:55.830> a<00:04:55.980> ton<00:04:56.220> but<00:04:56.550> um

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
tier 2 so that doesn't help a ton but um

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.450 
tier 2 so that doesn't help a ton but um
it's<00:04:57.090> the<00:04:57.750> and<00:04:57.900> then<00:04:58.050> but<00:04:58.380> depending<00:04:59.250> on<00:04:59.340> where

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
it's the and then but depending on where

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.220 
it's the and then but depending on where
