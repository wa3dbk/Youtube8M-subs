00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:12.049
 and I 'm going to teach you how to make a super 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.540
 fast and delicious and super easy 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:18.119
 guacamole look you see this heart with 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.470
 love for you so quickly 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.470
 I put with the ingredients 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.369
 already of how fast we are going to prepare 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.990
 This onion guacamole and I will 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.829
 I recommend that you put it to your 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.809
 like there are people who do not like the 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:42.070
 onion and good they take it off but I 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.839
 I think from my point of view that the 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.030
 Guacamole without onion is not the same 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:48.650
 so then I use this amount 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.370
 because this onion is pretty strong 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.370
 we cut 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.970
 I cut along and then I turn it back to 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.220
 cut 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.220
 so that it is super thin 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.710
 to me that I love the truth is that 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.400
 I know how there are people who may not like it 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.400
 the onion 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.250
 I am more 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.710
 as we would say in my country six in one 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.900
 but at one time that person with a 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.090
 new toy these knives have 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.440
 gifted and the truth is that I'm super 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.330
 Haunted 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:32.580
 let's go child with new toy is that 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.200
 they cut too good I have to go with 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.540
 careful because if I can not cut the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.400
 fingers 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.070
 here 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.460
 it is not that it is well cut well 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.070
 finite well small the pieces because 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:51.040
 so you can spend a little more 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.040
 unnoticed onion pieces 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.890
 and now the tomato this tomato already what 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.890
 I had previously washed 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.310
 the tripping of the tomato does not 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.310
 worry so much 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.890
 and now with the avocado we take it out 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:51.640
 with a fork we started to turn it off but 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.640
 does not speak for chaves so much in 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.040
 what 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.349
 a good guacamole has to have some 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.880
 pieces of avocados that 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:08.440
 always the occasional piece of avocado 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.440
 that if it was not already a cream 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.770
 admits that easy is that it is super fast 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.770
 and easy 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.329
 and now we are going to add 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.050
 very important the lemon 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.790
 watch with the seeds 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:41.160
 Pepper 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.160
 I put pepper on it I love it 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.480
 I put a little vegetable oil 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:48.790
 I prefer vegetable oil sometimes 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.260
 I put olive oil but I think the 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.580
 vegetable oil respect a little more the 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:57.840
 taste of what is avocado 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.840
 and now we put salt 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.880
 and last and quite important for 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.880
 me is 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.129
 the coriander 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.200
 if you really like the side 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:15.390
 you can cut thinner I like it 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.579
 so thick the truth is that cilantro 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.950
 I love the taste it gives the 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.560
 food 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.670
 and it is already 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.470
 ready to eat 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.240
 how it takes lemon can be preserved 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.580
 fairly good 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.069
 but you have to put it in a tupper that 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.740
 I did not get any air and we already have the 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:38.169
 ready guacamole 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.900
 you saw stars how easy it is to do 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:43.210
 this guacamole good since you're going to see 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.160
 how are they going to ask me all the time 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.750
 they ask me I said I look more 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.180
 mexican than colombian venezuelan 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.460
 Spanish so I hope that what 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.319
 enjoy and you'll see how it's going to 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.319
 like to see my beloved star
