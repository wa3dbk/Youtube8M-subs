know<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.729> looked<00:01:47.909> like<00:01:47.970> all<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:49.049> other

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
know it looked like all the other

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.499 
know it looked like all the other
guitars<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:49.829> type<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.970> know<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> standard

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
guitars of this type you know a standard

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.749 
guitars of this type you know a standard
mother-of-pearl<00:01:52.049> pick<00:01:52.530> guard<00:01:52.770> animal

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
mother-of-pearl pick guard animal

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.030 
mother-of-pearl pick guard animal
roaring<00:01:53.970> yeah<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.439> wanted<00:01:55.710> something<00:01:55.920> a

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
roaring yeah so I wanted something a

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.859 
roaring yeah so I wanted something a
little<00:01:56.219> bit<00:01:56.310> different<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.030> had<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.689> idea

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
little bit different so I had this idea

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.870 
little bit different so I had this idea
that<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.320> could<00:01:58.530> make<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:58.950> make<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.610> look<00:01:59.759> like

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
that I could make this make it look like

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.190 
that I could make this make it look like
there<00:02:00.030> was<00:02:00.060> clockwork<00:02:00.630> that's<00:02:00.930> not<00:02:01.079> the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
there was clockwork that's not the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.830 
there was clockwork that's not the
guitar<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:02.100> drew<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:03.240> image<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.810> I

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
guitar so I I drew the the image and I

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.459 
guitar so I I drew the the image and I
used<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.670> process<00:02:05.670> that's<00:02:06.119> usually<00:02:06.509> made<00:02:06.869> used

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
used a process that's usually made used

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.070 
used a process that's usually made used
for<00:02:07.770> making<00:02:08.539> electronic<00:02:09.539> printed<00:02:09.780> circuit

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
for making electronic printed circuit

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.930 
for making electronic printed circuit
blocks<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.770> put<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.039> image<00:02:11.250> on<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.430> brash<00:02:11.700> and

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
blocks to put the image on the brash and

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.630 
blocks to put the image on the brash and
then<00:02:12.030> I

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
then I

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.420 
then I
each<00:02:13.450> tit<00:02:13.840> using<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.560> nineteenth-century

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
each tit using a nineteenth-century

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.140 
each tit using a nineteenth-century
technique<00:02:16.240> where<00:02:16.569> you<00:02:16.690> use<00:02:16.720> electricity<00:02:17.170> and

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
technique where you use electricity and

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.940 
technique where you use electricity and
copper<00:02:19.150> sulfate<00:02:19.540> or<00:02:19.720> blue<00:02:19.990> vitriol<00:02:20.470> oh<00:02:20.770> that's

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
copper sulfate or blue vitriol oh that's

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.020 
copper sulfate or blue vitriol oh that's
great<00:02:21.069> well<00:02:21.220> that<00:02:21.310> actually<00:02:21.459> makes<00:02:21.790> it<00:02:21.880> more

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
great well that actually makes it more

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.220 
great well that actually makes it more
authentic<00:02:22.090> too<00:02:22.540> because<00:02:22.720> using<00:02:22.900> that<00:02:23.050> process

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
authentic too because using that process

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.530 
authentic too because using that process
all<00:02:23.860> right<00:02:24.040> so<00:02:24.250> with<00:02:24.760> that<00:02:24.819> etching<00:02:25.120> process

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
all right so with that etching process

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.150 
all right so with that etching process
you've<00:02:25.720> done<00:02:25.959> you've<00:02:26.560> done<00:02:26.590> an<00:02:26.800> image<00:02:26.980> on<00:02:27.100> the

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
you've done you've done an image on the

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.520 
you've done you've done an image on the
back<00:02:27.310> of<00:02:27.459> this<00:02:27.580> iPod<00:02:27.940> yes<00:02:28.569> so<00:02:29.110> can<00:02:29.260> you<00:02:29.290> tell<00:02:29.500> us

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
back of this iPod yes so can you tell us

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.990 
back of this iPod yes so can you tell us
a<00:02:29.650> little<00:02:29.680> bit<00:02:29.860> about<00:02:30.040> this<00:02:30.190> image<00:02:30.459> well<00:02:30.730> this

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
a little bit about this image well this

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.900 
a little bit about this image well this
is<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.720> Lady<00:02:32.080> ADA<00:02:32.410> Byron<00:02:32.820> Countess<00:02:33.820> of

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
is the Lady ADA Byron Countess of

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.910 
is the Lady ADA Byron Countess of
Lovelace<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.630> she's<00:02:34.810> often<00:02:35.290> considered<00:02:35.890> to

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
Lovelace and she's often considered to

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.830 
Lovelace and she's often considered to
be<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.190> first<00:02:36.490> computer<00:02:37.000> programmer

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
be the first computer programmer

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.150 
be the first computer programmer
she<00:02:38.590> wrote<00:02:38.860> a<00:02:39.360> series<00:02:40.360> of<00:02:40.480> instructions<00:02:41.260> for<00:02:41.800> I

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
she wrote a series of instructions for I

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.340 
she wrote a series of instructions for I
believe<00:02:42.520> it<00:02:42.670> was<00:02:42.760> doing<00:02:43.060> Fourier<00:02:43.480> transforms

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
believe it was doing Fourier transforms

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.560 
believe it was doing Fourier transforms
so<00:02:44.920> there<00:02:45.250> was<00:02:45.370> that<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.120> difference<00:02:46.420> engine

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
so there was that the difference engine

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.390 
so there was that the difference engine
yes<00:02:47.050> Charles<00:02:47.350> Babbage's<00:02:47.860> Difference<00:02:47.920> Engine

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
yes Charles Babbage's Difference Engine

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.270 
yes Charles Babbage's Difference Engine
yeah<00:02:48.730> which<00:02:49.270> is<00:02:49.300> there's<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.260> reproduction<00:02:51.010> of

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
yeah which is there's a reproduction of

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.820 
yeah which is there's a reproduction of
it<00:02:51.370> in<00:02:51.489> the<00:02:51.610> London<00:02:52.090> Museum<00:02:52.870> of<00:02:53.200> Science<00:02:53.620> well

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
it in the London Museum of Science well

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.199 
it in the London Museum of Science well
this<00:02:53.920> is<00:02:54.040> a<00:02:54.130> this<00:02:54.280> is<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.519> fitting<00:02:54.850> tribute<00:02:54.880> to

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
this is a this is a fitting tribute to

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.850 
this is a this is a fitting tribute to
have<00:02:55.390> her<00:02:55.480> image<00:02:55.690> on<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.870> back<00:02:56.050> of<00:02:56.260> a<00:02:56.290> super

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
have her image on the back of a super

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.710 
have her image on the back of a super
high-tech<00:02:56.980> iPod<00:02:57.519> I<00:02:57.700> think<00:02:58.060> it<00:02:58.180> is<00:02:58.269> well<00:02:58.540> let's

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
high-tech iPod I think it is well let's

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.280 
high-tech iPod I think it is well let's
move<00:02:59.350> on<00:02:59.440> a<00:02:59.500> little<00:02:59.620> bit<00:02:59.769> so<00:03:00.670> I<00:03:01.030> assume<00:03:01.930> that

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
move on a little bit so I assume that

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.920 
move on a little bit so I assume that
you<00:03:03.220> did<00:03:03.370> not<00:03:03.519> buy<00:03:03.820> this<00:03:03.880> Dell<00:03:04.300> flat-screen

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
you did not buy this Dell flat-screen

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.690 
you did not buy this Dell flat-screen
right<00:03:05.350> out<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.620> box<00:03:05.830> what<00:03:06.130> inspired<00:03:06.519> this

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
right out of the box what inspired this

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.180 
right out of the box what inspired this
piece<00:03:06.910> well<00:03:07.510> it<00:03:07.660> came<00:03:07.900> out<00:03:08.080> you<00:03:08.500> know<00:03:08.620> typical

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.400 
piece well it came out you know typical
gray<00:03:09.430> plastic<00:03:09.730> and<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.810> world<00:03:10.989> is<00:03:11.140> full<00:03:11.350> of

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
gray plastic and the world is full of

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.949 
gray plastic and the world is full of
gray<00:03:11.769> PLAs<00:03:12.040> yeah<00:03:12.420> so<00:03:13.420> one<00:03:13.540> of<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:13.690> things<00:03:13.870> I

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.300 
gray PLAs yeah so one of the things I
like<00:03:14.110> to<00:03:14.230> do<00:03:14.320> and<00:03:14.500> all<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.620> pieces<00:03:15.100> is

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
like to do and all the pieces is

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.520 
like to do and all the pieces is
incorporate<00:03:16.000> something<00:03:16.239> that's<00:03:16.510> actually<00:03:16.840> an

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
incorporate something that's actually an

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.740 
incorporate something that's actually an
antique<00:03:17.920> right<00:03:18.310> so<00:03:18.640> I<00:03:18.670> had<00:03:18.940> purchased<00:03:19.239> these

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
antique right so I had purchased these

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.960 
antique right so I had purchased these
these<00:03:19.810> are<00:03:20.290> gas<00:03:20.650> lamp<00:03:21.040> arms<00:03:21.610> they<00:03:21.850> would

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
these are gas lamp arms they would

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.690 
these are gas lamp arms they would
normally<00:03:22.500> attach<00:03:23.500> to<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:23.829> wall<00:03:24.010> and<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.489> gas

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
normally attach to the wall and the gas

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.000 
normally attach to the wall and the gas
lamp<00:03:25.060> would<00:03:25.239> attach<00:03:25.540> to<00:03:26.170> this<00:03:26.560> end<00:03:26.799> they'd

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
lamp would attach to this end they'd

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.830 
lamp would attach to this end they'd
hold<00:03:27.250> it<00:03:27.459> away<00:03:27.790> from<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.120> walls<00:03:28.299> back<00:03:28.690> in

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
hold it away from the walls back in

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.840 
hold it away from the walls back in
caveman<00:03:29.290> times<00:03:29.620> when<00:03:29.890> they<00:03:29.980> used<00:03:30.190> gas<00:03:30.459> lamps

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
caveman times when they used gas lamps

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.819 
caveman times when they used gas lamps
yeah<00:03:31.060> I<00:03:31.390> would<00:03:31.720> keep<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.170> wallpaper<00:03:32.650> from

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
yeah I would keep the wallpaper from

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.770 
yeah I would keep the wallpaper from
catching<00:03:33.100> fire<00:03:33.250> yeah<00:03:33.700> so<00:03:34.360> I<00:03:34.390> bought<00:03:34.630> these

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
catching fire yeah so I bought these

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.080 
catching fire yeah so I bought these
online<00:03:35.200> and<00:03:35.590> I<00:03:36.040> was<00:03:36.190> unwrapping<00:03:36.549> them<00:03:36.820> at<00:03:36.970> my

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
online and I was unwrapping them at my

online and I was unwrapping them at my
desk<00:03:37.390> at<00:03:37.750> work<00:03:37.959> and<00:03:38.320> I<00:03:38.380> pulled<00:03:38.709> them<00:03:38.799> out<00:03:38.890> of

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
desk at work and I pulled them out of

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.380 
desk at work and I pulled them out of
the<00:03:39.100> box<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.640> they<00:03:39.760> just<00:03:40.000> seemed<00:03:40.299> to

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
the box and they just seemed to

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.509 
the box and they just seemed to
naturally<00:03:41.079> go<00:03:41.500> on<00:03:41.680> either<00:03:41.920> side<00:03:42.250> of<00:03:42.280> my

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
naturally go on either side of my

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.550 
naturally go on either side of my
monitor<00:03:42.910> that's<00:03:43.180> fantastic<00:03:43.690> I<00:03:43.780> mean<00:03:43.810> and<00:03:44.380> what

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
monitor that's fantastic I mean and what

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.319 
monitor that's fantastic I mean and what
I<00:03:44.590> like<00:03:44.709> about<00:03:44.799> it<00:03:44.950> is<00:03:45.070> it<00:03:45.280> actually<00:03:45.640> they<00:03:46.090> move

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
I like about it is it actually they move

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:47.910 
I like about it is it actually they move
and<00:03:46.630> squeak<00:03:46.959> and<00:03:47.170> so<00:03:47.350> that<00:03:47.500> makes<00:03:47.650> it<00:03:47.769> really

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
and squeak and so that makes it really

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.770 
and squeak and so that makes it really
it<00:03:48.400> gives<00:03:48.549> up<00:03:48.670> the<00:03:48.760> rickety<00:03:49.120> but<00:03:49.329> high<00:03:49.510> ammok

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
it gives up the rickety but high ammok

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.270 
it gives up the rickety but high ammok
yeah<00:03:50.019> exactly<00:03:50.680> a<00:03:50.709> completely<00:03:51.130> mechanical

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
yeah exactly a completely mechanical

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.850 
yeah exactly a completely mechanical
feel<00:03:51.820> I<00:03:52.090> mean<00:03:52.480> do<00:03:52.630> you<00:03:52.690> feel<00:03:52.870> it<00:03:53.079> a<00:03:53.110> lot<00:03:53.290> of<00:03:53.470> Arts

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
feel I mean do you feel it a lot of Arts

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.150 
feel I mean do you feel it a lot of Arts
inspires<00:03:54.700> science<00:03:55.329> to<00:03:56.230> then<00:03:56.380> go<00:03:56.650> forward<00:03:56.920> and

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
inspires science to then go forward and

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.960 
inspires science to then go forward and
produce<00:03:57.970> and<00:03:58.299> I<00:03:59.170> think<00:03:59.470> you<00:04:00.400> know<00:04:00.489> I<00:04:00.519> think<00:04:00.670> I

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
produce and I think you know I think I

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.780 
produce and I think you know I think I
take<00:04:01.239> some<00:04:01.750> of<00:04:01.780> my<00:04:02.250> inspiration<00:04:03.250> if<00:04:03.400> you<00:04:03.549> will

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
take some of my inspiration if you will

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.830 
take some of my inspiration if you will
by<00:04:04.420> artistic<00:04:04.870> information<00:04:05.590> from<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.040> science

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
by artistic information from the science

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.660 
by artistic information from the science
so<00:04:07.840> I<00:04:08.110> think<00:04:08.530> they<00:04:08.590> go<00:04:08.709> hand<00:04:08.739> in<00:04:09.010> hand<00:04:09.070> this<00:04:09.489> is

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
so I think they go hand in hand this is

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:10.710 
so I think they go hand in hand this is
my<00:04:09.760> favorite<00:04:10.120> piece<00:04:10.209> by<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:10.450> way<00:04:10.510> the

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
my favorite piece by the way the

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.140 
my favorite piece by the way the
keyboard<00:04:11.530> is<00:04:11.829> stunning<00:04:12.549> did<00:04:12.820> these<00:04:12.910> come<00:04:13.090> from

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
keyboard is stunning did these come from

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.880 
keyboard is stunning did these come from
like<00:04:13.420> an<00:04:13.510> Underwood<00:04:13.840> typewriter<00:04:14.109> and<00:04:14.590> added

smith-corona fantastic well why don't
you<00:04:20.440> since<00:04:20.769> we're<00:04:20.890> on<00:04:20.950> the<00:04:21.010> topic<00:04:21.190> of<00:04:21.370> the

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
you since we're on the topic of the

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.760 
you since we're on the topic of the
keyboard<00:04:22.060> you<00:04:22.630> can<00:04:22.660> actually<00:04:22.900> show<00:04:23.229> us<00:04:23.410> how<00:04:23.740> to

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
keyboard you can actually show us how to

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.090 
keyboard you can actually show us how to
make<00:04:23.860> this

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
make this

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.890 
make this
in<00:04:25.220> our<00:04:25.310> own<00:04:25.460> homes<00:04:25.730> so<00:04:25.970> how'd<00:04:26.660> you<00:04:26.780> go<00:04:26.870> about

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
in our own homes so how'd you go about

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.860 
in our own homes so how'd you go about
that<00:04:27.110> okay<00:04:27.590> well<00:04:27.800> the<00:04:27.920> first<00:04:27.950> step<00:04:28.490> is<00:04:28.870> to

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
that okay well the first step is to

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.450 
that okay well the first step is to
actually<00:04:30.260> remove<00:04:30.950> a<00:04:31.280> key<00:04:31.520> from<00:04:31.850> the<00:04:32.240> keyboard

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
actually remove a key from the keyboard

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.190 
actually remove a key from the keyboard
so<00:04:34.460> the<00:04:34.670> keys<00:04:34.940> pop<00:04:35.180> off<00:04:35.390> fairly<00:04:35.630> easily<00:04:35.840> with<00:04:36.170> a

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
so the keys pop off fairly easily with a

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.080 
so the keys pop off fairly easily with a
screwdriver<00:04:36.500> and<00:04:36.980> the<00:04:37.400> first<00:04:37.670> thing<00:04:37.880> that<00:04:38.000> we

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
screwdriver and the first thing that we

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.330 
screwdriver and the first thing that we
need<00:04:38.270> to<00:04:38.390> do<00:04:38.540> is<00:04:38.780> we<00:04:39.050> need<00:04:39.110> to<00:04:39.260> cut<00:04:39.620> off<00:04:39.860> the

need to do is we need to cut off the

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.130 
need to do is we need to cut off the

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
skirt that's around the outside of the

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.110 
skirt that's around the outside of the
key<00:04:42.350> that<00:04:42.530> sounds<00:04:42.860> sexy<00:04:43.040> let's<00:04:43.430> put<00:04:43.670> on<00:04:43.790> our

safety goggles all right you know it's
not<00:04:47.600> steampunk<00:04:48.410> if<00:04:48.560> there<00:04:48.740> aren't<00:04:48.890> goggles

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
not steampunk if there aren't goggles

not steampunk if there aren't goggles
involved<00:04:49.730> absolutely<00:04:50.240> I<00:04:50.420> feel<00:04:50.510> like<00:04:50.780> I<00:04:50.870> should

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020
