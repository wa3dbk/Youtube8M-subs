00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
combustion when the time is most

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.360 
combustion when the time is most
opportune<00:02:22.000> that's<00:02:22.780> when<00:02:23.020> living<00:02:23.349> bomb<00:02:23.560> dot

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
opportune that's when living bomb dot

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.199 
opportune that's when living bomb dot
from<00:02:24.730> pyroblast<00:02:25.209> and<00:02:25.660> ignite<00:02:26.050> are<00:02:26.290> all<00:02:26.470> up

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
from pyroblast and ignite are all up

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.820 
from pyroblast and ignite are all up
second<00:02:28.209> would<00:02:28.390> be<00:02:28.420> pyroblast<00:02:29.230> when<00:02:29.620> hot

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
second would be pyroblast when hot

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.699 
second would be pyroblast when hot
streak<00:02:30.190> is<00:02:30.340> up<00:02:30.690> third<00:02:31.690> will<00:02:31.930> be<00:02:31.959> flame<00:02:32.410> war

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
streak is up third will be flame war

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.430 
streak is up third will be flame war
whenever<00:02:33.160> it's<00:02:33.430> off<00:02:33.610> clue<00:02:33.910> down<00:02:34.209> you<00:02:35.110> always

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
whenever it's off clue down you always

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.869 
whenever it's off clue down you always
want<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.650> make<00:02:35.800> sure<00:02:35.830> flame<00:02:36.250> or<00:02:36.520> up<00:02:36.610> is<00:02:36.700> on

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
want to make sure flame or up is on

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.479 
want to make sure flame or up is on
cooldown<00:02:37.590> fourth<00:02:38.590> would<00:02:38.770> be<00:02:38.890> living<00:02:39.280> bomb

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
cooldown fourth would be living bomb

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.670 
cooldown fourth would be living bomb
always<00:02:40.390> make<00:02:40.630> sure<00:02:40.660> that<00:02:40.870> is<00:02:41.170> on<00:02:41.320> your<00:02:41.470> target

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
always make sure that is on your target

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.930 
always make sure that is on your target
for<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.430> best<00:02:42.640> possible<00:02:42.910> DPS

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
for the best possible DPS

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.500 
for the best possible DPS
fifth<00:02:44.810> would<00:02:45.080> be<00:02:45.230> critical<00:02:46.130> mass<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:46.760> you<00:02:46.850> can

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
fifth would be critical mass and you can

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.590 
fifth would be critical mass and you can
refresh<00:02:47.900> that<00:02:47.960> by<00:02:48.380> using<00:02:48.590> scorch<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.600> sixth

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
refresh that by using scorch and sixth

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.150 
refresh that by using scorch and sixth
when<00:02:51.200> all<00:02:51.350> else<00:02:51.560> is<00:02:51.920> up<00:02:52.730> use<00:02:53.480> fireball<00:02:54.110> was<00:02:54.920> why

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
when all else is up use fireball was why

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.960 
when all else is up use fireball was why

not so in retrospect you're going to

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.590 
not so in retrospect you're going to

coming up last now if you have some
issues<00:03:09.710> with<00:03:09.860> combustion<00:03:10.430> there's<00:03:11.240> an<00:03:11.420> add-on

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
issues with combustion there's an add-on

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.900 
issues with combustion there's an add-on
called<00:03:12.110> combustion<00:03:12.800> helper<00:03:13.190> that<00:03:13.700> will<00:03:13.790> help

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
called combustion helper that will help

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.890 
called combustion helper that will help
you<00:03:14.120> maximize<00:03:14.780> your<00:03:14.950> return<00:03:15.950> for<00:03:16.550> it

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
you maximize your return for it

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.730 
you maximize your return for it
basically<00:03:17.900> it's<00:03:18.050> going<00:03:18.200> to<00:03:18.260> let<00:03:18.380> you<00:03:18.530> know

basically it's going to let you know

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.940 
basically it's going to let you know
when<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.520> best<00:03:19.880> opportune<00:03:20.420> time<00:03:20.720> is<00:03:20.990> the<00:03:21.680> cast

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
when the best opportune time is the cast

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.430 
when the best opportune time is the cast
it<00:03:22.220> so<00:03:22.850> if<00:03:23.270> you<00:03:23.600> think<00:03:23.840> you<00:03:23.960> may<00:03:24.110> have<00:03:24.140> some
