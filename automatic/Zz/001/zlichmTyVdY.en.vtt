00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.720 
hey guys Larry Becker here and today
I've<00:00:32.240> got<00:00:32.270> a<00:00:32.690> 2<00:00:33.020> light<00:00:33.350> kit<00:00:33.710> plus<00:00:34.220> a<00:00:34.430> radio

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
I've got a 2 light kit plus a radio

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.910 
I've got a 2 light kit plus a radio
transmitter<00:00:35.330> that's<00:00:35.930> breaking<00:00:36.380> ground

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
transmitter that's breaking ground

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.800 
transmitter that's breaking ground
because<00:00:37.310> of<00:00:37.340> its<00:00:37.550> wireless<00:00:37.850> capabilities

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 
because of its wireless capabilities

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.080 
because of its wireless capabilities
sure<00:00:39.590> these<00:00:39.830> mono<00:00:40.130> lights<00:00:40.430> have<00:00:40.670> built-in

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
sure these mono lights have built-in

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.910 
sure these mono lights have built-in
wireless<00:00:41.570> receivers<00:00:42.140> that<00:00:42.410> work<00:00:42.590> with<00:00:42.800> the

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
wireless receivers that work with the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.160

optional prio light radio remote control

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.530 
optional prio light radio remote control
but<00:00:45.739> that's<00:00:46.040> not<00:00:46.340> really<00:00:46.790> the<00:00:46.820> groundbreaking

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
but that's not really the groundbreaking

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.200 
but that's not really the groundbreaking

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
extra power automatically so you don't

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.999 
extra power automatically so you don't
even<00:02:08.030> have<00:02:08.179> to<00:02:08.450> fire<00:02:08.690> a<00:02:08.720> test<00:02:09.170> flash<00:02:09.500> to<00:02:09.800> dump

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
battery but it lets you reposition your

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.530 
battery but it lets you reposition your
model<00:03:55.130> and<00:03:55.280> move<00:03:55.459> things<00:03:55.730> around<00:03:55.880> while

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
model and move things around while

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.240 
model and move things around while
you're<00:03:56.810> studying<00:03:57.110> the<00:03:57.380> light<00:03:57.680> so<00:03:58.130> you<00:03:58.220> can

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
you're studying the light so you can

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.860 
you're studying the light so you can
actually<00:03:58.519> see<00:03:58.970> what<00:03:59.209> you're<00:03:59.329> about<00:03:59.510> to<00:03:59.690> get

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
actually see what you're about to get

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.800 
actually see what you're about to get
the<00:04:00.769> light<00:04:01.010> with<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:01.519> battery<00:04:01.850> installed<00:04:02.510> and

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
the light with the battery installed and

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.979 
the light with the battery installed and
a<00:04:03.200> reflector<00:04:03.680> in<00:04:03.799> place<00:04:04.040> is<00:04:04.280> about<00:04:04.549> 8.4<00:04:05.420> pounds

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
a reflector in place is about 8.4 pounds

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.140 
a reflector in place is about 8.4 pounds
so<00:04:06.380> I<00:04:06.410> really<00:04:06.920> appreciate<00:04:07.459> the<00:04:07.640> mounting

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
so I really appreciate the mounting

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.569 
so I really appreciate the mounting
hardware<00:04:08.650> specifically<00:04:09.650> there's<00:04:10.130> a<00:04:10.220> rail

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
hardware specifically there's a rail

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.449 
hardware specifically there's a rail
along<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.329> entire<00:04:11.750> underside<00:04:12.680> so<00:04:13.190> that<00:04:13.340> you

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
along the entire underside so that you

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.000 
along the entire underside so that you
can<00:04:13.670> move<00:04:13.880> the<00:04:14.120> unit<00:04:14.420> forward<00:04:14.989> or<00:04:15.170> backward<00:04:15.829> to

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
can move the unit forward or backward to

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.650 
can move the unit forward or backward to
balance<00:04:16.430> it<00:04:16.609> depending<00:04:17.120> on<00:04:17.209> what<00:04:17.269> light

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
balance it depending on what light

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.170 
balance it depending on what light
