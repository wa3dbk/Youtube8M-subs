so just press it again and it turns off
one<00:01:22.630> thing<00:01:22.780> I<00:01:22.810> don't<00:01:22.870> really<00:01:23.050> like<00:01:23.260> is<00:01:23.710> how

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
one thing I don't really like is how

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.700 
one thing I don't really like is how
sensitive<00:01:24.130> on/off<00:01:25.090> button<00:01:25.510> is<00:01:25.660> if<00:01:26.380> you<00:01:26.500> just

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
sensitive on/off button is if you just

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.370 
sensitive on/off button is if you just
tap<00:01:27.130> it<00:01:27.310> by<00:01:27.430> accident<00:01:27.640> it<00:01:28.000> will<00:01:28.060> turn<00:01:28.450> on<00:01:28.660> so<00:01:29.110> I

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
tap it by accident it will turn on so I

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.660 
tap it by accident it will turn on so I
wish<00:01:29.560> it<00:01:29.740> would<00:01:29.830> have<00:01:30.010> like<00:01:30.250> a<00:01:30.280> kind<00:01:30.490> of<00:01:30.580> a

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
wish it would have like a kind of a

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.340 
wish it would have like a kind of a
clicking<00:01:31.210> or<00:01:31.450> something<00:01:31.840> like<00:01:31.900> that

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
clicking or something like that

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.710 
clicking or something like that
make<00:01:33.010> it<00:01:33.130> floor<00:01:34.090> she'd<00:01:34.240> press<00:01:34.420> a<00:01:34.450> little<00:01:34.570> bit

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
make it floor she'd press a little bit

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.230 
make it floor she'd press a little bit
harder<00:01:35.110> for<00:01:35.140> it<00:01:35.320> it<00:01:35.410> turn<00:01:35.590> on<00:01:35.880> but<00:01:36.880> there<00:01:37.090> it<00:01:37.180> is

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
harder for it it turn on but there it is

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:44.300 
harder for it it turn on but there it is
powering<00:01:37.750> down<00:01:37.900> then<00:01:38.860> it's<00:01:38.980> off<00:01:42.540> dance<00:01:43.540> or

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
powering down then it's off dance or

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.359 
powering down then it's off dance or
which<00:01:45.310> of<00:01:45.460> course<00:01:45.490> turns<00:01:46.000> into<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:47.370> rifle

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
which of course turns into the rifle

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.960 
which of course turns into the rifle
like<00:01:51.369> that<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:57.310> can<00:01:57.430> put<00:01:57.640> it<00:01:57.760> together

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
like that and you can put it together

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.680 
like that and you can put it together
with<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:59.820> combine<00:02:00.820> it<00:02:00.970> with<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.210> other<00:02:01.390> one

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
with the combine it with the other one

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.540 
with the combine it with the other one
so<00:02:02.050> it's<00:02:02.229> got<00:02:02.380> a<00:02:02.410> little<00:02:02.530> peg<00:02:02.800> right<00:02:03.040> here<00:02:03.280> but

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
so it's got a little peg right here but

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.219 
so it's got a little peg right here but
usually<00:02:03.850> you<00:02:04.180> just<00:02:04.210> fold<00:02:04.570> it<00:02:04.690> in<00:02:04.810> but<00:02:05.080> it's

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
usually you just fold it in but it's

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:06.450 
usually you just fold it in but it's
really<00:02:05.350> hard<00:02:05.560> to<00:02:05.619> take<00:02:05.740> outside<00:02:05.920> just<00:02:06.310> leave

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
really hard to take outside just leave

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:15.030 
really hard to take outside just leave
it<00:02:06.580> on<00:02:09.630> like<00:02:10.630> that<00:02:13.170> that's<00:02:14.170> over<00:02:14.350> a<00:02:14.500> foot<00:02:14.590> long

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
it on like that that's over a foot long

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.120 
it on like that that's over a foot long
it's<00:02:15.340> probably<00:02:15.880> maybe<00:02:16.810> a<00:02:16.930> foot<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.410> a<00:02:17.770> quarter

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
it's probably maybe a foot and a quarter

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.910 
it's probably maybe a foot and a quarter
or<00:02:18.220> so<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:22.420> if<00:02:22.600> you<00:02:22.720> want<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.410> beam<00:02:23.620> saber

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
or so and if you want the beam saber

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.460 
or so and if you want the beam saber
mode<00:02:24.220> then<00:02:24.459> they<00:02:24.550> have<00:02:24.730> this<00:02:25.000> thing<00:02:25.470> just

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
mode then they have this thing just

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:34.310 
mode then they have this thing just
slide<00:02:26.769> it<00:02:26.920> on<00:02:27.070> to<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.400> middle<00:02:31.200> like<00:02:32.200> that

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:44.119 

again<00:02:35.320> this<00:02:35.470> is<00:02:35.790> over<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:36.820> foot<00:02:37.090> long

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.539 

and<00:02:46.379> 4gn<00:02:47.379> shields<00:02:47.980> of<00:02:48.129> course<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:48.430> can

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
and 4gn shields of course you can

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:54.170 
and 4gn shields of course you can
combine<00:02:48.879> these<00:02:49.150> two<00:02:49.209> you<00:02:50.079> can<00:02:50.230> just<00:02:51.159> pull<00:02:51.489> this

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.220 

put<00:02:55.180> this<00:02:55.360> down<00:02:57.000> pull<00:02:58.000> this<00:02:58.180> up<00:02:58.450> again<00:02:58.840> if<00:02:59.170> you

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
put this down pull this up again if you

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.990 
put this down pull this up again if you
put<00:02:59.739> it<00:02:59.829> in<00:02:59.950> all<00:03:00.129> the<00:03:00.250> way<00:03:00.280> it's<00:03:00.579> hard<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:00.849> take

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
put it in all the way it's hard to take

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:11.929 
put it in all the way it's hard to take
outside<00:03:01.480> on<00:03:01.750> I<00:03:01.989> never<00:03:02.200> put<00:03:02.409> it<00:03:02.500> in<00:03:02.680> all<00:03:02.829> the<00:03:02.950> way

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:11.939 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:17.970 

and<00:03:12.939> you<00:03:13.060> can<00:03:13.239> oops<00:03:14.519> actually<00:03:15.519> put<00:03:15.970> this<00:03:16.980> down

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
and you can oops actually put this down

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:29.429 
and you can oops actually put this down
even<00:03:18.010> further<00:03:18.629> up<00:03:23.970> there<00:03:24.970> now<00:03:25.959> you<00:03:26.019> can<00:03:28.439> put

00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:29.439 
even further up there now you can put

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:36.270 
even further up there now you can put
these<00:03:29.560> together<00:03:29.859> like<00:03:31.590> so<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:35.099> it'll<00:03:36.099> have

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
these together like so and it'll have

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.399 
these together like so and it'll have
the<00:03:36.430> little<00:03:36.730> hook<00:03:36.879> here<00:03:37.120> so<00:03:37.269> you<00:03:37.389> can<00:03:37.540> put<00:03:38.319> her

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:38.409 
the little hook here so you can put her

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:43.440 
the little hook here so you can put her
onto<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.769> arm<00:03:41.459> and<00:03:42.459> it<00:03:42.819> was<00:03:42.939> pointed<00:03:43.299> out<00:03:43.389> to

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
onto the arm and it was pointed out to

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.610 
onto the arm and it was pointed out to
me<00:03:43.750> in<00:03:44.139> one<00:03:44.439> my<00:03:44.530> previous<00:03:44.920> videos<00:03:45.250> that<00:03:46.620> the

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
me in one my previous videos that the

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.830 
me in one my previous videos that the
legs<00:03:47.919> should<00:03:48.480> go

start assembling and I guess that's what
