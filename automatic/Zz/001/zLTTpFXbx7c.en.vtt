Bruce's<00:02:02.970> face<00:02:03.330> I<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:04.170> don't<00:02:04.530> even<00:02:04.740> know<00:02:05.070> what<00:02:05.820> is

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
Bruce's face I I don't even know what is

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.810 
Bruce's face I I don't even know what is
going<00:02:06.300> on<00:02:06.420> here<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.930> mean<00:02:07.680> everybody<00:02:08.369> else's

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
going on here I mean everybody else's

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.229 
going on here I mean everybody else's
face<00:02:09.030> looks<00:02:09.300> normal<00:02:09.660> what's<00:02:09.840> Bruce's<00:02:10.350> problem

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.449 
face looks normal what's Bruce's problem
okay<00:02:12.239> but<00:02:12.300> really<00:02:12.780> besides<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:14.250> art

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
okay but really besides that the art

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.430 
okay but really besides that the art
style<00:02:14.760> really<00:02:15.060> drives<00:02:15.450> home<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.810> writing

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
style really drives home the writing

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.130 
style really drives home the writing
sure<00:02:17.250> in<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:17.880> it's<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.180> little<00:02:18.630> more<00:02:18.750> mature

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
sure in that it's a little more mature

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.320 
sure in that it's a little more mature
but<00:02:19.170> also<00:02:19.560> because<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.100> contrasting<00:02:20.580> Smith

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
but also because the contrasting Smith

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.990 
but also because the contrasting Smith
does<00:02:21.570> with<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.900> Batman<00:02:22.080> mythos<00:02:22.790> Bruce<00:02:23.790> has

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
does with the Batman mythos Bruce has

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.320 
does with the Batman mythos Bruce has
these<00:02:24.300> flashbacks<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:25.440> Silver<00:02:26.310> Age<00:02:26.550> times<00:02:27.030> and

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
these flashbacks to Silver Age times and

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.870 
these flashbacks to Silver Age times and
the<00:02:27.930> art<00:02:28.140> similarly<00:02:28.920> gets<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.459> little<00:02:29.610> brighter

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
the art similarly gets a little brighter

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.850 
the art similarly gets a little brighter
these<00:02:30.690> flashbacks<00:02:31.050> when<00:02:31.470> we<00:02:31.530> make<00:02:31.709> the

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
these flashbacks when we make the
