00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:13.760
 Hello, I want to share another 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:16.369
 device facilitating the work of the installer 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.710
 doors namely in order not to 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.960
 crawling on your knees on the floor during 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:25.730
 circumcision 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:27.789
 Etel in the box today we squared in 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.199
 some time 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.289
 made I can say they invented 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:37.570
 because I saw similar devices 

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:41.360
 many guys like that 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.730
 today pac at cops we did something 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.780
 its 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:52.540
 I'll tell you now 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.540
 the nuances of how it is mounted on the door show 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:07.100
 I hope that this video will be to someone 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:12.619
 useful here is what we got here 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:16.509
 so this whole thing pour on the door that is 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.859
 about tone design goes u-shaped 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:24.009
 up 

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:30.619
 into which the box is inserted . 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:33.979
 clamp here well for now let's say this 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:38.409
 everything was thought up literally over 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:43.780
 half an hour and brought to life 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:45.549
 here is a wedge but for now 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.920
 I don’t know anything else 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.520
 I will not come up with this 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.689
 blades 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:56.520
 that is, the strength of that plan 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:02:04.450
 does not move anywhere there are places where 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:11.170
 fasten the pattern holder does not interfere by 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:14.920
 30 centimeters in length from edge to court 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:18.519
 30 centimeters it is like this 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.120
 looks like when you work only 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.920
 only have to shift when 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.079
 you start over that is from here we are 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.110
 template set small 11 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:33.370
 centimeters and framed pattern stabbed 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.829
 and when the second charge that pushed here 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.900
 This part of it interferes 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.780
 to rest but no matter how 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.299
 problems a little box to move there 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.780
 if from that side we mill then into that 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:49.269
 side is not a neighbor this is this this is how it is 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.859
 Looks like I will show you how she looks 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.859
 without a box 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:07.370
 This is how it looks without a box. This is how it is. 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:09.880
 It becomes such two wedges I 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.880
 made 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.269
 and now let's show how it looks 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:34.860
 here is a design with a width of 8 and a half 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:39.810
 my plate is such a holder 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:42.480
 three centimeters here three centimeters 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.840
 this allows him not to stick out 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.430
 above the box did not stick out on the quarters 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:52.910
 but no less so the box into it 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:57.260
 rested a little here for the centers 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:04:01.859
 did offset in order when and 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:05.909
 you put the door there are already wider that is 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:08.549
 wide part of the door here it is 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:15.359
 part of what is needed for this 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:16.019
 so that the door was supported under that place 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.530
 Where 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:22.229
 you get into a loop so that there are no deflections 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.200
 first off the box especially if they 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:28.220
 thin and secondly this is the playground she 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:32.490
 allows you to do such work as 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:34.979
 hack no if someone out there someone just 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.680
 climbs someone sharp tool of 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:40.800
 the toe chisel with a hammer finish 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.340
 corners if you can do it right on 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.670
 the doors 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:48.840
 This site she gives rigidity 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:50.850
 don't bend the city ​​for this i did 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.960
 30 centimeters but for convenience 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:59.670
 milling then there is this edge 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:02.340
 it turns out that the saw is up to the mountains and he 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:06.540
 goes level, that is, does not interfere with the pattern 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.530
 holder and the width that's over the door and but 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:13.530
 literally comes out 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:18.200
 even 23 millimeters even if 42 is 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:24.570
 door there let alone the narrow doors are thin 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:28.020
 which are 32 by 32 millimeters there 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:30.660
 say nothing will need to work in 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:35.130
 In general, this is the construction we thought. 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:38.130
 with alexander even for the most part he 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:40.740
 I was inspired a little bit differently 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:46.740
 wanted to do but we concluded that 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:48.830
 so it will be better that's all thanks to all 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.830
