00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.260
 Hello dear friends with you I am 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.199
 today's sedan do a review on 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.539
 map naruto shipuden batova in zbs 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.780
 I will say in advance that the card is not very 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.880
 much she liked not strange pskr 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.890
 support for naruto is very rare 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.410
 the thing is all the more good support 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.859
 so let's look at what 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.079
 worked the author is 1 piece she meets in 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.690
 the game is that the mouse in the game is just 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.370
 non-working you have to use 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.460
 buttons that is to walk 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.500
 jump back and forth and so on me 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.140
 it seems very interesting to me 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.579
 very much she liked 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.890
 also here is just so impossible 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.160
 attack with the mouse and then you have to 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:57.270
 push the button unfold to the horns 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.460
 throw them also the most kunai do 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.610
 different abilities it will also need 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.760
 turn in jira is cotton raseng 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:11.340
 which is done very well also 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:14.790
 have his swamp he has appliances 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.860
 appeal and it is unique in that you 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.040
 don't know which jabba jiraiya 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.470
 call it can be either such a toad 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.350
 that is more or less protected or 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.500
 gamma riot which makes a cat on my 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.909
 Endan and he has three techniques 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:36.810
 just hair first throws its 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:40.310
 needles will become enemies thereby our damage 2 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.189
 he does damage with a scythe and third he 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.890
 hiding under its mane which gives 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.200
 protection for him and all the techniques were 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.590
 voiced all the techniques were pretty day 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.750
 beautiful pretty and playable 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.640
 there is a normally balanced me this 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.560
 liked 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.680
 first you have to come not 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.899
 very long way and let in 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.869
 I would also like to mention one of 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.419
 cons of this map and that it weighs 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.549
 20 one megabyte and the cartoon itself 

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.300
 for multiplayer it is not calculated then 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.310
 there is 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.620
 and the veil you can't play with friends 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.110
 in this maputu and the president is only one 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.150
 the character of jiraiya is possible in the following 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.670
 author versions this will somehow change that 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.310
 whatever I don't know but for now 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.290
 only single mode and here we are 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.270
 we are staying in konoha in konoha as you 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.330
 see pretty beautiful landscape 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.500
 You will need to fir in the most 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.380
 the end of the horse 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.260
 but rather to the building of the Hokage to 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.630
 meet the tsunade and report important 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.290
 information that dobrudzhi rally 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:03:03.480
 let's look at kinematics itself 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:03:05.580
 which may well be shorter 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.430
 saying not to drag you too much 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.950
 In this review I will say briefly Jirai 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.860
 found out who the leader of akatsuki is 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.410
 he came to hold this su must be in advance 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.820
 what I liked will say what is here 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:23.010
 there was a voice acting here the voice acting from anime 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.950
 that is, in Russian, I understand everything to me 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.200
 very much also liked very much 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.360
 well set landscape is like 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.209
 it's all worth it how she dissuade him 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.810
 Diana is also very beautiful on Jiraiya 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:39.720
 says goodbye to the tsunade and leave and goes to 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.780
 the search for the very leader of ataki or rather 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.060
 not even to search but to catch 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.580
 to kill him more about him 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.880
 find out well, everything is basically like his 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.130
 them further everything how its not majira will come 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.090
 on the river turn into a frog or 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:59.489
 like a frog crawls in and I donâ€™t remember exactly 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.830
 he will already appear near the village of rain where 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.770
 we will also be accompanied by kinematics 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.959
 here he climbs so epic toads well 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.459
 of course on warcraft fuck where only 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.200
 ok that's why he somehow 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.190
 grows up but even so it was pretty 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:17.150
 not bad yes 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:19.850
 same as we see it learns nudity he 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.430
 feels that his arrival is jira and 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.450
 speak the law that he heard in 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.180
 strange chakra 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:29.720
 here and then the chase begins you must 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:32.660
 catch up with that click which 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.520
 runs away well most likely this dude 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.750
 whose gerald was from him 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.060
 information further 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.690
 such catch up appears them immediately 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:45.170
 two after you are with them 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.540
 he straightened their jaba stomach 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:50.720
 torture turns jabba well everything is just like 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:55.400
 I understand further as you see 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:59.180
 they rather run away from him alone 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:04.990
 an apostate or most likely a member of a pancake from 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:08.330
 villages of rain even so and this already 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.160
 let's say so the end of this part and all this 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:14.300
 hint that in the second part already 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:17.450
 there will be a battle soon all is about for help 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.610
 thanked and so on I think it's time 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:23.900
 to sum up this pretty 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:26.180
 good rpc I can say that in advance 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.340
 I basically liked the landscape 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.350
 cons in that creeps 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.510
 creep is more made standard though 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.300
 the card weighs 20 megabytes and I understand that 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:38.030
 weighs a lot and so here are some 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.910
 squeaks were there monsters different turtles 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.010
 and so on also cannot be played with 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.320
 friends in such a wonderful map like 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.810
 would see a multiplayer in the following 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.669
 Versions of us can fly though a moment 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.970
 he is unlikely to be able to because the weight of the card 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:55.840
 if there is 50 megabytes, then a clear stump and 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.840
 not everyone can 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.620
 Jiraiya is also the ability to have more than made 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.700
 all voiced everything is well done well 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.070
 really here 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.230
 there's nothing to complain about 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:09.830
 I liked it very good and I am not very 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:13.120
 I often play so well done by 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:19.030
 my name is Crater if I'm not mistaken 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:19.030
 From English I am a hidan reviewer of naruto cards for now
