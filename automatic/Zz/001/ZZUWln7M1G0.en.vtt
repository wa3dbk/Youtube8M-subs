00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:08.370
 hello there will be such a review on 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.230
 mug potatoes here it is in the soup 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.500
 I really didn't plan to do this 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.080
 this i am now polished in the fridge 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.779
 the plague to eat open the refrigerator 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.320
 Grandma bought this little potato 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:27.119
 soup three such and three more the same only 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:30.710
 with a hodgepodge in general as for baby 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.420
 potatoes, then it is garbage delicious at all to 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.070
 pears all sorts of potatoes on the flock there 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.030
 hamburger same subway 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.399
 yes as mcdonald subway plus any 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.050
 burger king there for any 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.260
 here are fast food restaurants 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.440
 I like them all they like to me 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.590
 very tasty but I spend money on them 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.989
 I do not like therefore I eat them very very 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.750
 rarely the last time I ate potatoes 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.329
 probably grandfather and in 2008 I ate and 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.239
 minus the potatoes we went ice hockey with 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.760
 friends bought this potato and from us 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.240
 there was such a joke like if you eat 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.240
 a lot of potatoes then you burst we laughed 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.790
 here's a baby potato kai dream you are all 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.320
 I like them very rarely I buy it 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.820
 Now she bought 3 so I already 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.060
 said this soup 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.090
 then you need to add water 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.580
 boiled and put in the oven at full 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.130
 power I have there minutes she here she 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:36.509
 very hot I get to stir it 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:40.579
 create and try here the cap and on 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.579
 why did she decide to buy baby potatoes 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:51.600
 this is our soup and that is the line here 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.869
 This is because this is more he 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:02:00.960
 thick 1 thick therefore need liquid 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:03.090
 crush here and in the stove so basically 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.930
 we get more good 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.310
 eat you our sour go took 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.860
 everything just poured it in the stove she 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.350
 I got ready to warm up 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.520
 I tried everything I always try on camera 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.040
 here is the last time on 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.840
 out of the last how much do i make these secret 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.340
 reviews 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.820
 but with her it is interesting to write down my 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.240
 the first 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:30.920
 the first reaction of the faithful and the reading and 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.920
 smell great good i like 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:50.990
 pieces of meat to taste accounting me very 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:17.520
 principle is no longer very good better 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:20.910
 Of course, to make it clear in 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.920
 not really so delicious i would 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.270
 here did not chat five fifty on 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.870
 fifty that is possible in principle and 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:31.110
 try it out of those who did not touch 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:34.310
 fifty fifty that is shit would 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.310
 I wouldn't call him either 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:46.409
 but this piece of meat is quite a lot 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:55.620
 it's us that sausage a piece of sausage well 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:56.629
 ka sosisochka this too is not it all the pieces 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.519
 meat 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:02.329
 Now I want to put here 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.329
 add sour cream 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:18.229
 separate clean sour cream spoon 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:25.949
 I'll figure it out sour cream by the way on this 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.199
 channel I already did a typesetter review 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:31.789
 which he prepared for you by the way 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.789
 much more delicious this shit 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:38.340
 that is, I call shit a word you 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:41.130
 you know, yes, their soup in principle 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:46.409
 nothing so but 50 to 50 just me so 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:49.169
 conditional called his shit basically 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:50.849
 if you are there somewhere on the road to you 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.280
 wanted to eat you came to baby 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:56.669
 the potato is better as better of course 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:00.599
 here's the potatoes i like best 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:02.970
 baby potatoes with onion here is double 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:05.550
 I advise you to just have it baby 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:10.190
 potatoes with double onions take 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.190
 necessarily much tastier than this soup 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:34.660
 even with sour cream and he is not really that 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:36.700
 tastes better there is no difference what is 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.600
 methane that no what kind has changed a little 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.600
 a little lighter 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:47.890
 so baby potatoes bigger than me 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:51.430
 gets 5 points somehow try 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:53.140
 parking but they have a shelf life of 72 hours 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.440
 that is, in the coming days you will need them 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:06:00.160
 eat and do not know how we are together with us 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:02.050
 all this we will imagine three such 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.540
 borscht stuff one I just ate a boost 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:07.660
 sheet mom and one is divided in half and 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:12.850
 plus 3 solyanka also 1a scheme one and she 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:14.830
 divide in half so that's what 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:19.860
 wait for the next few days, soryan points too 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.860
 let's try let's evaluate when from a magnet
