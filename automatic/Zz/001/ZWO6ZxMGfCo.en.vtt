00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:25.050
 it is necessary to grow grapes 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.279
 live there for a hundred years to gain that experience 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.160

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.140
 grapes 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:38.940
 Well, all this is wrong 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:43.230
 growing grapes professionally I 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:47.899
 got engaged here is the principle of the third year goes like 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.899

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:57.660
 the vineyard before this experience was not where 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:03.840
 take this internet experience by the way too 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:06.560
 there was no gay take this experience well there 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.750
 means some kind of literature 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:15.180
 at first this book was bought by me 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:19.799
 such a sconce joke so primitive 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:23.490
 a brochure then somehow I saw such 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.970
 a book now I will show it to you here 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:31.170

 arrival is called all about grapes 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:42.290
 I did not buy such a book and thanks 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:46.590
 this book is shorter here 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:50.610
 the whole foundation is completely from 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.920
 planting from how to break a vineyard like 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.890
 cut by the way cut the grapes I 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.189
 learned from this book here everything is very 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.030
 sensibly and intelligibly the author describes everything 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:06.340
 what formulations are such 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.590
 ways how to cut and by the way how 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.900
 hide back in this book that i am here 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:16.440
 like there is a calendar like 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.550
 say monthly 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:23.920
 work on grapes and for example there and 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.500
 June will take experience of the month must do 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.380
 seam and Julia in August in September and 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.770
 so all twelve months and here 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.380
 described here for example i like how 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.920
 say didn't know what to do in that or 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.550
 another month here that's well written in 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.020
 certain place you go out and 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.680
 work this mts holds such 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:51.690
 such an operation all this strictly 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:55.950
 following the recommendations of this book and 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:03:00.700
 Solomonova with s all right 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:04.590
 everything is written well I achieved such 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:07.510
 results by the way the video I'll post 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.480
 just the quality of shooting is not very 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:15.180
 it turned out but it can be seen that the frost 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:19.269
 large grapes are clean and not overgrown 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:23.200
 everything turned out shorter what else I wanted 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:29.260
 say you have such a book too 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:33.430
 here, by the way, there are some behind as well 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:36.700
 say now show for notes 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.950
 Here is a graph for notes all that for 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.200

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.769

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.930
 over time it is all forgotten then I 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.680
 here turning opening the bow remembered there 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.910
 reference such wholesale video is not 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.220
 I got the internet 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.920
 began to bring in there where the store in 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.690
 what cheaper sho to buy there what 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:05.079
 video to comrade there you can see 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.820
 This book is very useful. 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:10.120
 video dedicate to those who want to do 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.640
 grow grapes first internet 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.640
 of course it's a good thing yes but in 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.700
 the Internet is very difficult to distinguish 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.260
 correct information from wrong and 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:24.099
 what advice there what color 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:27.669
 well, it's very difficult to use here 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:29.680
 everything is very clear as you can read 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.669
 this book on this book prop 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.039
 relevant plots and navigate 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:40.410
 such a plan and so you will 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:44.220
 sift out unnecessary false advice 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:48.550
 focusing on this book so here 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:52.000
 a good book as for me I do not know 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:55.650
 as for whom but normal for me 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:00.760
 source of knowledge using this knowledge 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:03.550
 in three years I have achieved this 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:08.349
 the result as you saw a three year old 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.610
 age I got a good crop of well 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:14.080
 it's like in my plan 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:17.610
 for whom how everything is for the next 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:21.750
 video next me will be something too 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.750
