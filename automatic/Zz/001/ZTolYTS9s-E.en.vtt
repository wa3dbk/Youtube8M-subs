everyone<00:00:03.510> welcome<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:04.020> the<00:00:04.170> fourth<00:00:04.560> podcast

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
everyone welcome to the fourth podcast

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.760 
everyone welcome to the fourth podcast
of<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.779> ecology<00:00:06.779> unit<00:00:07.080> we<00:00:07.259> are<00:00:07.290> going<00:00:07.440> to<00:00:07.649> be

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
of the ecology unit we are going to be

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.770 
of the ecology unit we are going to be
taking<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.250> quick<00:00:08.460> look<00:00:08.580> at<00:00:08.940> carbon<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.630> the

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
taking a quick look at carbon and the

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.860 
taking a quick look at carbon and the
nitrogen<00:00:09.990> cycles<00:00:10.800> today<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:11.250> these<00:00:11.790> are

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
nitrogen cycles today and these are

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.030 
nitrogen cycles today and these are
second<00:00:12.870> and<00:00:12.900> third<00:00:12.990> cycles<00:00:13.620> remember<00:00:13.920> our

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
second and third cycles remember our

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.609 
second and third cycles remember our
first<00:00:14.280> one<00:00:14.460> was<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.730> water<00:00:14.969> cycle<00:00:15.500> where<00:00:16.500> we

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
first one was the water cycle where we

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.130 
first one was the water cycle where we
looked<00:00:16.859> at<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.070> process<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:18.140> evaporation

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
looked at the process of evaporation

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.019 
looked at the process of evaporation
condensation<00:00:19.470> precipitation<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.970> then

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
condensation precipitation and then

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.080 
condensation precipitation and then
pooling<00:00:21.449> again<00:00:21.949> very<00:00:22.949> similar<00:00:23.250> cycles<00:00:23.789> here

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
pooling again very similar cycles here

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.359 
pooling again very similar cycles here
with<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.449> carbon<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:24.900> nitrogen<00:00:25.039> the<00:00:26.039> carbon

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
with the carbon and nitrogen the carbon

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.859 
with the carbon and nitrogen the carbon
and<00:00:26.490> nitrogen<00:00:26.550> present<00:00:27.210> on<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.359> planet<00:00:27.689> have

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
and nitrogen present on the planet have

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.240 
and nitrogen present on the planet have
been<00:00:27.900> here<00:00:28.170> since<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.560> beginning<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.980> time

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
been here since the beginning of time

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.840 
been here since the beginning of time
just<00:00:29.519> like<00:00:29.730> with<00:00:29.910> water<00:00:30.289> and<00:00:31.289> they<00:00:32.099> flow<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.669> a

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
just like with water and they flow in a

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.729 
just like with water and they flow in a
cycle<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.750> carbon<00:00:34.079> cycle<00:00:34.290> we're<00:00:34.559> going<00:00:34.680> to

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
cycle so the carbon cycle we're going to

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.410 
cycle so the carbon cycle we're going to
be<00:00:34.829> looking<00:00:35.100> at<00:00:35.250> atmospheric<00:00:35.430> carbon<00:00:36.270> dioxide

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
be looking at atmospheric carbon dioxide

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.180 
be looking at atmospheric carbon dioxide
and<00:00:37.200> then<00:00:37.649> what<00:00:37.800> we're<00:00:37.920> gonna<00:00:37.980> call

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
and then what we're gonna call

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.459 
and then what we're gonna call
terrestrial<00:00:38.940> carbon<00:00:39.450> dioxide<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.170> this<00:00:40.320> is

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
terrestrial carbon dioxide so this is

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.200 
terrestrial carbon dioxide so this is
gonna<00:00:40.590> be<00:00:40.680> atmospheric<00:00:40.950> co2<00:00:41.520> will<00:00:41.879> start<00:00:42.120> up

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
gonna be atmospheric co2 will start up

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.910 
gonna be atmospheric co2 will start up
here<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.600> we'll<00:00:42.750> do<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.290> blue<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.739> guess

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
here and we'll do this in blue I guess

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.920 
here and we'll do this in blue I guess
so<00:00:44.129> atmospheric<00:00:44.370> carbon<00:00:44.940> dioxide<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.750> is

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
so atmospheric carbon dioxide this is

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.600 
so atmospheric carbon dioxide this is
gaseous<00:00:46.530> carbon<00:00:48.620> gaseous<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:49.800> carbon<00:00:50.280> dioxide

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
gaseous carbon gaseous so carbon dioxide

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.479 
gaseous carbon gaseous so carbon dioxide
is<00:00:50.730> what<00:00:50.850> we<00:00:50.940> are<00:00:51.059> exhaling<00:00:51.510> all<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.050> time

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
is what we are exhaling all of the time

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.410 
is what we are exhaling all of the time
when<00:00:53.489> humans<00:00:54.270> exhale<00:00:54.690> ur<00:00:54.780> animals<00:00:55.260> exhale<00:00:56.420> and

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
when humans exhale ur animals exhale and

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.979 
when humans exhale ur animals exhale and
those<00:00:57.989> exhale

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
those exhale

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:10.450 
those exhale
plants<00:01:02.149> they<00:01:03.149> use<00:01:03.510> co2<00:01:04.760> for<00:01:05.810> photosynthesis

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.670 

where<00:01:11.460> they<00:01:11.640> take<00:01:11.939> sunlight<00:01:12.689> energy<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.500> they

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
where they take sunlight energy and they

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.710 
where they take sunlight energy and they
take<00:01:13.950> carbon<00:01:14.280> dioxide<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.880> they<00:01:15.000> split<00:01:15.450> water

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
take carbon dioxide and they split water

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.280 
take carbon dioxide and they split water
to<00:01:16.530> release<00:01:17.240> extra<00:01:18.240> energy<00:01:18.570> by<00:01:18.659> forming<00:01:18.720> new

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
to release extra energy by forming new

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.130 
to release extra energy by forming new
bonds<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.860> glucose<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.610> sugar<00:01:20.720> now<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:21.960> this

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
bonds and glucose and sugar now so this

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.230 
bonds and glucose and sugar now so this
is<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.439> autotroph<00:01:23.130> portion<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.030> process

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
is the autotroph portion of the process

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.060 
is the autotroph portion of the process
so<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:24.750> atmospheric<00:01:25.229> carbon<00:01:25.409> dioxide<00:01:25.920> is

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
so this atmospheric carbon dioxide is

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.670 
so this atmospheric carbon dioxide is
taken<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.610> by<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.820> plant<00:01:27.150> we<00:01:28.080> can<00:01:28.229> sue<00:01:28.380> over<00:01:28.439> here

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
taken in by a plant we can sue over here

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.510 
taken in by a plant we can sue over here
the<00:01:28.829> trees<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:30.500> their<00:01:31.500> organic<00:01:31.950> compounds

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
the trees and their organic compounds

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.160 
the trees and their organic compounds
remember<00:01:32.790> organic<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.570> anything<00:01:34.049> that

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
remember organic is anything that

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.260 
remember organic is anything that
contains<00:01:34.409> carbon<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.189> these<00:01:35.640> trees<00:01:36.060> are

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
contains carbon so these trees are

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.840 
contains carbon so these trees are
pulling<00:01:36.540> atmospheric<00:01:37.229> carbon<00:01:37.829> dioxide<00:01:38.520> into

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
pulling atmospheric carbon dioxide into

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.240 
pulling atmospheric carbon dioxide into
it<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.540> essentially<00:01:40.439> what<00:01:40.590> happens<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.100> that

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
it and essentially what happens is that

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.679 
it and essentially what happens is that
carbon<00:01:41.549> works<00:01:41.820> its<00:01:42.000> way<00:01:42.119> back<00:01:42.299> through<00:01:42.509> the

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
carbon works its way back through the

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.870 
carbon works its way back through the
plant<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.079> enters<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.860> soil<00:01:44.369> again<00:01:44.579> down

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
plant and enters the soil again down

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.120 
plant and enters the soil again down
here<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.540> carbon<00:01:45.930> solids<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.829> soil

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
here to the carbon solids in the soil

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.609 
here to the carbon solids in the soil
and<00:01:47.460> that's<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.270> terrestrial<00:01:49.079> carbon<00:01:49.320> and

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
and that's the terrestrial carbon and

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.960 
and that's the terrestrial carbon and
they'll<00:01:49.710> do<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.159> black<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:50.670> we<00:01:50.700> can

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
they'll do this in black so we can

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.670 
they'll do this in black so we can
denote<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.420> two<00:01:51.630> terrestrial<00:01:52.439> carbon

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.700 

and<00:01:58.450> so<00:01:59.450> this<00:01:59.600> is<00:01:59.750> carbon<00:01:59.990> that's<00:02:00.230> stuck<00:02:00.500> in

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
and so this is carbon that's stuck in

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.400 
and so this is carbon that's stuck in
the<00:02:00.830> ground

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
the ground

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:11.500 
the ground
ground-based<00:02:04.480> or<00:02:05.480> organic<00:02:06.170> material<00:02:10.480> okay

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
ground-based or organic material okay

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.870 
ground-based or organic material okay
you<00:02:12.080> are<00:02:12.350> terrestrial<00:02:12.680> carbon<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.430> carbon<00:02:13.460> in

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
you are terrestrial carbon the carbon in

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.390 
you are terrestrial carbon the carbon in
your<00:02:13.910> cells<00:02:14.360> is<00:02:14.750> part<00:02:15.080> of<00:02:15.260> locked<00:02:15.680> up<00:02:15.980> carbon

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
your cells is part of locked up carbon

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.510 
your cells is part of locked up carbon
atoms<00:02:17.080> when<00:02:18.080> things<00:02:18.470> die<00:02:18.680> so<00:02:18.980> like<00:02:19.100> when<00:02:19.250> trees

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
atoms when things die so like when trees

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.280 
atoms when things die so like when trees
died<00:02:19.790> they<00:02:20.000> can<00:02:20.180> go<00:02:20.330> one<00:02:20.540> of<00:02:20.570> two<00:02:20.660> ways<00:02:20.810> we<00:02:21.200> can

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
died they can go one of two ways we can

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.330 
died they can go one of two ways we can
either<00:02:21.410> burn<00:02:21.800> them

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
either burn them

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.450 
either burn them
okay<00:02:22.760> so<00:02:22.880> burning<00:02:23.740> carbon<00:02:24.740> containing

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
okay so burning carbon containing

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.400 
okay so burning carbon containing
compounds<00:02:26.090> so<00:02:26.270> burning<00:02:28.660> carbon<00:02:29.660> will<00:02:29.870> produce

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
compounds so burning carbon will produce

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.449 
compounds so burning carbon will produce
co2<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:31.959> it<00:02:32.959> will<00:02:33.110> become<00:02:33.530> atmospheric

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
co2 and it will become atmospheric

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.140 
co2 and it will become atmospheric
carbon<00:02:34.670> again<00:02:34.940> it<00:02:35.090> will<00:02:35.620> recycle<00:02:36.620> itself<00:02:37.190> or

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
carbon again it will recycle itself or

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.910 
carbon again it will recycle itself or
when<00:02:38.480> it<00:02:38.600> dies<00:02:38.810> it<00:02:39.140> will<00:02:39.170> enter<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.680> ground

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
when it dies it will enter the ground

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.940 
when it dies it will enter the ground
and<00:02:40.070> get<00:02:40.160> broken<00:02:40.610> down<00:02:40.880> by<00:02:41.600> bacteria<00:02:41.630> or<00:02:42.560> fungi

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
and get broken down by bacteria or fungi

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:43.870 
and get broken down by bacteria or fungi
or<00:02:43.070> things<00:02:43.280> like<00:02:43.430> that<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:43.730> it<00:02:43.790> will

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
or things like that and it will

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.460 
or things like that and it will
eventually<00:02:44.270> become<00:02:44.420> a<00:02:44.540> fossil<00:02:44.959> fuel<00:02:45.170> and

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
eventually become a fossil fuel and

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.180 
eventually become a fossil fuel and
these<00:02:45.650> are<00:02:45.890> oils<00:02:46.370> or<00:02:47.360> it<00:02:47.780> is<00:02:47.900> oil<00:02:48.170> coal<00:02:49.160> and

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
these are oils or it is oil coal and

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.970 
these are oils or it is oil coal and
things<00:02:49.730> like<00:02:49.850> that<00:02:50.350> so<00:02:51.350> carbon<00:02:51.590> can<00:02:51.830> go<00:02:51.950> a

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
things like that so carbon can go a

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.290 
things like that so carbon can go a
couple<00:02:52.040> different<00:02:52.520> ways<00:02:52.580> first<00:02:52.910> of<00:02:53.060> all<00:02:53.180> you

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
couple different ways first of all you

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.510 
couple different ways first of all you
can<00:02:53.480> take<00:02:53.690> it<00:02:53.840> in<00:02:53.959> and<00:02:54.170> then<00:02:54.950> you<00:02:55.040> can<00:02:55.130> exhale

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
can take it in and then you can exhale

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.870 
can take it in and then you can exhale
it<00:02:55.670> out<00:02:55.760> as<00:02:55.910> carbon<00:02:56.209> dioxide<00:02:56.240> is<00:02:56.750> waste<00:02:56.990> or<00:02:57.880> we

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
it out as carbon dioxide is waste or we

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.610 
it out as carbon dioxide is waste or we
can<00:02:59.090> take<00:02:59.270> it<00:02:59.420> in<00:02:59.540> by<00:02:59.660> a<00:02:59.690> consuming<00:03:00.470> organic

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
can take it in by a consuming organic

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.860 
can take it in by a consuming organic
compounds<00:03:01.580> and<00:03:01.760> recycle<00:03:02.239> it<00:03:02.360> back<00:03:02.390> through

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
compounds and recycle it back through

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.979 
compounds and recycle it back through
the<00:03:03.019> ground<00:03:03.320> or<00:03:04.190> we<00:03:04.700> can<00:03:04.970> burn<00:03:05.300> it<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:05.660> release

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
the ground or we can burn it and release

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.020 
the ground or we can burn it and release
it<00:03:06.170> again<00:03:06.290> back<00:03:06.890> into<00:03:07.160> the<00:03:07.280> atmosphere<00:03:07.489> so

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
it again back into the atmosphere so

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.430 
it again back into the atmosphere so
carbon<00:03:08.330> is<00:03:08.510> going<00:03:08.630> to<00:03:08.750> be<00:03:08.840> either<00:03:08.900> stuck<00:03:09.320> in

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
carbon is going to be either stuck in

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.960 
carbon is going to be either stuck in
the<00:03:09.530> atmosphere<00:03:09.950> as<00:03:10.040> carbon<00:03:10.160> dioxide<00:03:10.370> or<00:03:10.850> it's

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
the atmosphere as carbon dioxide or it's

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:11.979 
the atmosphere as carbon dioxide or it's
going<00:03:11.060> to<00:03:11.120> be<00:03:11.180> stuck<00:03:11.420> in<00:03:11.570> the<00:03:11.630> ground<00:03:11.780> as<00:03:11.959> a

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
going to be stuck in the ground as a

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.380 
going to be stuck in the ground as a
carbon<00:03:12.410> containing<00:03:12.769> compound<00:03:13.340> and<00:03:14.269> so

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
carbon containing compound and so

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.000 
carbon containing compound and so
there's<00:03:14.570> a<00:03:14.630> lot<00:03:14.780> of<00:03:14.840> research<00:03:15.769> right<00:03:15.980> now

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
there's a lot of research right now

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.430 
there's a lot of research right now
going<00:03:16.430> about<00:03:16.670> how<00:03:16.940> to<00:03:17.000> remove<00:03:17.720> some<00:03:18.260> of<00:03:18.290> this

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
going about how to remove some of this

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.259 
going about how to remove some of this
atmospheric<00:03:18.980> carbon<00:03:19.190> and<00:03:19.489> put<00:03:19.610> it<00:03:19.730> back<00:03:19.940> into

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
atmospheric carbon and put it back into

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.030 
atmospheric carbon and put it back into
the<00:03:20.510> ground<00:03:20.690> and<00:03:20.959> we<00:03:21.019> can<00:03:21.140> talk<00:03:21.320> more<00:03:21.590> about

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
the ground and we can talk more about

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.259 
the ground and we can talk more about
that<00:03:22.220> research<00:03:22.610> later<00:03:22.940> if<00:03:23.120> you're<00:03:23.209> interested

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
that research later if you're interested

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.009 
that research later if you're interested
in<00:03:23.870> it<00:03:23.989> so<00:03:24.739> let<00:03:24.830> me<00:03:24.860> find<00:03:25.040> my<00:03:25.190> mouse<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:26.510> then

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
in it so let me find my mouse and then

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.240 
in it so let me find my mouse and then
let's<00:03:27.200> take<00:03:27.290> a<00:03:27.350> look<00:03:27.560> at<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:27.739> nitrogen<00:03:28.220> cycle

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
let's take a look at the nitrogen cycle

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.430 
let's take a look at the nitrogen cycle
the<00:03:28.640> nitrogen<00:03:29.209> cycle<00:03:29.239> is<00:03:29.630> very<00:03:29.840> similar<00:03:30.290> to

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
the nitrogen cycle is very similar to

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.140 
the nitrogen cycle is very similar to
the<00:03:30.560> carbon<00:03:30.920> cycle<00:03:31.130> in<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.519> sense<00:03:31.760> that<00:03:31.850> it<00:03:32.060> is

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
the carbon cycle in the sense that it is

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.180 
the carbon cycle in the sense that it is
atmospheric<00:03:32.590> so<00:03:33.590> nitrogen<00:03:34.010> in<00:03:34.100> the

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
atmospheric so nitrogen in the

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.520 
atmospheric so nitrogen in the
atmosphere<00:03:34.220> here<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.300> then<00:03:36.290> there's

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
atmosphere here and then there's

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.030 
atmosphere here and then there's
nitrogen<00:03:36.739> in<00:03:37.280> terrestrial<00:03:38.680> groups<00:03:39.680> so

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
nitrogen in terrestrial groups so

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.680 
nitrogen in terrestrial groups so
there's<00:03:40.340> atmospheric<00:03:40.880> nitrogen<00:03:41.150> again<00:03:41.390> and

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
there's atmospheric nitrogen again and

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.570 
there's atmospheric nitrogen again and
that's<00:03:41.810> going<00:03:41.959> to<00:03:42.019> be<00:03:42.200> mostly<00:03:42.769> so<00:03:43.250> in<00:03:43.459> the

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
that's going to be mostly so in the

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:50.170 
that's going to be mostly so in the
atmosphere<00:03:46.390> mostly<00:03:47.390> n2<00:03:47.900> nitrogen<00:03:48.350> gas<00:03:49.180> the

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
atmosphere mostly n2 nitrogen gas the

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.320 
atmosphere mostly n2 nitrogen gas the
atmosphere<00:03:50.750> right<00:03:50.780> now<00:03:50.989> is<00:03:51.410> 78<00:03:51.980> percent<00:03:52.030> or<00:03:53.030> so

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
atmosphere right now is 78 percent or so

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.509 
atmosphere right now is 78 percent or so
nitrogen<00:03:53.750> gas<00:03:54.290> so<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.799> majority<00:03:55.160> of<00:03:55.370> the

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
nitrogen gas so the majority of the

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.220 
nitrogen gas so the majority of the
atmosphere<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.000> majority<00:03:56.690> of<00:03:56.750> the<00:03:56.810> gases

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
atmosphere the majority of the gases

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.630 
atmosphere the majority of the gases
that<00:03:57.260> you're<00:03:57.470> inhaling<00:03:57.799> every<00:03:58.220> second<00:03:58.580> of

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
that you're inhaling every second of

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.250 
that you're inhaling every second of
every<00:03:58.850> single<00:03:58.880> day<00:03:59.269> is<00:03:59.420> nitrogen<00:03:59.840> we<00:04:00.110> don't

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
every single day is nitrogen we don't

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.890 
every single day is nitrogen we don't
use<00:04:00.590> it<00:04:00.799> so<00:04:00.920> it<00:04:01.160> goes<00:04:01.310> right<00:04:01.519> back<00:04:01.580> out<00:04:01.940> there

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
use it so it goes right back out there

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.860 
use it so it goes right back out there
can<00:04:03.140> also<00:04:03.350> be<00:04:03.530> nitrogen<00:04:04.150> put<00:04:05.150> into<00:04:05.570> the<00:04:05.690> ground

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
can also be nitrogen put into the ground

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.949 
can also be nitrogen put into the ground
by<00:04:06.079> animals<00:04:06.590> through<00:04:06.889> their<00:04:07.040> wastes<00:04:07.959> so

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
by animals through their wastes so

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.530 
by animals through their wastes so
animal<00:04:09.410> waste

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:19.979 

will<00:04:13.540> produce<00:04:13.840> nitrogen<00:04:14.830> compost<00:04:18.810> okay

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
will produce nitrogen compost okay

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.460 
will produce nitrogen compost okay
the<00:04:20.680> animal<00:04:21.040> waste<00:04:21.459> typically<00:04:21.940> is<00:04:22.240> urine<00:04:22.720> okay

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
the animal waste typically is urine okay

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.470 
the animal waste typically is urine okay
so<00:04:23.530> that<00:04:24.190> bad<00:04:24.550> smelled<00:04:24.970> that<00:04:25.120> urine<00:04:25.330> had

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
so that bad smelled that urine had

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.750 
so that bad smelled that urine had
you're<00:04:25.660> smelling<00:04:25.990> a<00:04:26.200> nitrogen<00:04:26.680> compound<00:04:27.130> that

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
you're smelling a nitrogen compound that

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.310 
you're smelling a nitrogen compound that
will<00:04:27.940> eventually<00:04:28.180> find<00:04:28.720> its<00:04:28.840> way<00:04:28.990> back<00:04:29.260> into

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
will eventually find its way back into

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.310 
will eventually find its way back into
the<00:04:29.710> ground<00:04:30.040> and<00:04:30.479> this<00:04:31.479> waste<00:04:31.750> comes<00:04:32.169> from

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
the ground and this waste comes from

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.409 
the ground and this waste comes from
breaking<00:04:32.979> down<00:04:33.190> organic<00:04:33.460> compounds<00:04:34.210> so<00:04:34.300> when

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
breaking down organic compounds so when

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.030 
breaking down organic compounds so when
you<00:04:34.540> eat<00:04:34.690> a<00:04:34.720> salad<00:04:35.200> you<00:04:35.260> are<00:04:35.380> taking<00:04:35.740> in<00:04:35.860> some

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
you eat a salad you are taking in some

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.800 
you eat a salad you are taking in some
nitrogen<00:04:36.370> from<00:04:36.700> the<00:04:36.820> protein<00:04:37.270> in<00:04:37.389> the<00:04:37.450> salad

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
nitrogen from the protein in the salad

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.170 
nitrogen from the protein in the salad
and<00:04:37.960> then<00:04:38.440> it<00:04:38.560> gets<00:04:38.680> shoved<00:04:39.610> out<00:04:39.820> through<00:04:40.060> your

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
and then it gets shoved out through your

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.940 
and then it gets shoved out through your
body<00:04:40.360> by<00:04:40.570> your<00:04:40.720> excretory<00:04:41.110> system<00:04:41.680> and<00:04:41.889> it

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
body by your excretory system and it

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.950 
body by your excretory system and it
ends<00:04:42.190> up<00:04:42.280> eventually<00:04:42.639> in<00:04:42.940> the<00:04:43.030> ground<00:04:43.270> where

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
ends up eventually in the ground where

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.530 
ends up eventually in the ground where
what<00:04:44.110> happens<00:04:44.470> is<00:04:44.620> bacteria<00:04:45.280> will<00:04:46.030> take<00:04:46.330> the

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
what happens is bacteria will take the

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.540 
what happens is bacteria will take the
urine<00:04:46.870> or<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.590> waste<00:04:48.510> and<00:04:50.310> it's<00:04:51.310> called

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
urine or the waste and it's called

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.200 
urine or the waste and it's called
fixing<00:04:52.120> it<00:04:52.300> and<00:04:53.639> bacteria<00:04:54.639> fixed<00:04:55.090> the

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
fixing it and bacteria fixed the

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.570 
fixing it and bacteria fixed the
nitrogen<00:04:55.840> to<00:04:56.590> get<00:04:56.770> it<00:04:56.889> back

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
nitrogen to get it back

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.730 
nitrogen to get it back
to<00:04:58.060> plants<00:04:59.970> okay<00:05:00.970> so<00:05:01.900> and<00:05:02.200> we<00:05:02.320> can<00:05:02.440> see<00:05:02.590> this

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
to plants okay so and we can see this

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.320 
to plants okay so and we can see this
over<00:05:02.950> here<00:05:03.100> so<00:05:03.250> the<00:05:03.340> animal<00:05:03.729> will<00:05:03.850> take<00:05:04.030> it<00:05:04.180> in

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
over here so the animal will take it in

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.450 
over here so the animal will take it in
it<00:05:04.930> ingests<00:05:05.350> it<00:05:05.560> and<00:05:05.770> then<00:05:05.889> it<00:05:06.010> comes<00:05:06.190> out<00:05:06.280> as

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
it ingests it and then it comes out as

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.900 
it ingests it and then it comes out as
waste<00:05:06.729> the<00:05:07.630> bacteria<00:05:08.169> then<00:05:08.410> fix<00:05:08.860> it<00:05:09.070> where<00:05:09.760> it

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
waste the bacteria then fix it where it

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.820 
waste the bacteria then fix it where it
stays<00:05:10.240> in<00:05:10.570> the<00:05:10.720> ground<00:05:10.840> so<00:05:11.200> the<00:05:11.290> bacteria<00:05:11.440> fix

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
stays in the ground so the bacteria fix

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.260 
stays in the ground so the bacteria fix
the<00:05:11.950> nitrogen<00:05:12.340> and<00:05:12.490> then<00:05:12.580> it<00:05:12.669> gets<00:05:12.820> back<00:05:13.000> into

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
the nitrogen and then it gets back into

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.230 
the nitrogen and then it gets back into
the<00:05:13.389> plants<00:05:13.979> and<00:05:14.979> so<00:05:15.010> there's<00:05:15.789> there's<00:05:16.150> a

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
the plants and so there's there's a

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.090 
the plants and so there's there's a
cycle<00:05:16.660> here<00:05:16.870> more<00:05:17.260> so<00:05:17.530> in<00:05:17.680> the<00:05:17.710> terrestrial

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
cycle here more so in the terrestrial

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.040 
cycle here more so in the terrestrial
side<00:05:18.639> of<00:05:18.789> it<00:05:18.910> then<00:05:19.060> in<00:05:19.180> the<00:05:19.270> atmospheric<00:05:19.810> but

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
side of it then in the atmospheric but

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.390 
side of it then in the atmospheric but
again<00:05:20.289> we<00:05:20.440> can<00:05:20.590> find<00:05:20.800> nitrogen<00:05:21.190> in<00:05:21.310> the

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
again we can find nitrogen in the

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.850 
again we can find nitrogen in the
atmosphere<00:05:21.430> or<00:05:22.360> we<00:05:22.570> can<00:05:22.720> find<00:05:22.960> it<00:05:23.200> interesting

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
atmosphere or we can find it interesting

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.570 
atmosphere or we can find it interesting
when<00:05:24.370> it<00:05:24.460> starts<00:05:25.000> animal<00:05:25.479> wastes<00:05:26.580> bacteria

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
when it starts animal wastes bacteria

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.670 
when it starts animal wastes bacteria
fix<00:05:27.880> it<00:05:28.060> and<00:05:28.180> then<00:05:28.389> it<00:05:28.539> heads<00:05:28.840> back<00:05:29.110> into<00:05:29.560> the

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
fix it and then it heads back into the

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.379 
fix it and then it heads back into the
plant<00:05:29.889> system<00:05:30.280> so<00:05:30.490> it<00:05:30.610> can<00:05:30.669> be<00:05:30.880> recycled

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:31.389 
plant system so it can be recycled

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:33.840 
plant system so it can be recycled
through<00:05:31.539> again
