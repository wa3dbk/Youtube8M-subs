00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.200 

Adriana's<00:01:14.649> technique<00:01:15.649> where<00:01:16.070> she<00:01:16.399> put<00:01:17.119> the

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
Adriana's technique where she put the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.569 
Adriana's technique where she put the
two<00:01:17.360> buns<00:01:17.630> right<00:01:17.899> here<00:01:18.470> and<00:01:18.740> then<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.189> wig<00:01:19.340> cap

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
two buns right here and then the wig cap

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.940 
two buns right here and then the wig cap
and<00:01:20.000> all<00:01:20.090> that<00:01:20.329> and<00:01:20.600> then<00:01:20.659> left<00:01:21.290> out<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:21.619> front

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
and all that and then left out the front

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.800 
and all that and then left out the front
and<00:01:22.399> rolled<00:01:22.670> it<00:01:22.759> with<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:22.970> smallest<00:01:23.240> rollers

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
and rolled it with the smallest rollers

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.260 
and rolled it with the smallest rollers
also<00:01:24.290> try<00:01:24.409> the<00:01:24.470> products<00:01:24.979> that<00:01:25.009> she<00:01:25.250> use<00:01:25.490> and<00:01:25.759> I

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
also try the products that she use and I

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.190 
also try the products that she use and I
think<00:01:26.330> that<00:01:26.630> it<00:01:26.960> blended<00:01:28.060> well<00:01:29.060> as<00:01:29.659> you<00:01:30.020> can

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
think that it blended well as you can

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.350
