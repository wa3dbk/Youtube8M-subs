00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 Hi, producer friend, you already know me. 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.390
 about money markets 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.910
 once more I came here to chat 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.860
 healthy and clear take some tips there 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.929
 for your property because I will not speak 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.509
 on the topic many properties success 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.660
 For Brazil and I've been fixing the 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.730
 next what we need is what I 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.730
 I think since when I joined the 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.029
 agribusiness will reduce our pastures 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.550
 of our bastard areas and increase 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.279
 our productivity and I do not know how to 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.760
 several tips that will lead the 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.250
 our country to reduce our 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.989
 increase leverage productivity in 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.670
 beef lady 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.649
 today I will talk about a theme that is 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.780
 during the dry season 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.820
 many producers find it difficult 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.910
 very big will like 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.430
 dry pasture and lack of nutrition for the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.789
 leads the producer to spend much 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.829
 with its own mineral salt 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:01.379
 generally at this time 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.690
 loser rooster made the producer and still 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.909
 loses a lot of money with this nutrition 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.049
 with such high nutrition that he has to 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.159
 to serve the animals including 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.590
 properties there are regions in brazil 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.990
 where the producer in the dry season 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.570
 he markets the animals back to 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.400
 create only in the water period 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.790
 my tip today is precisely to 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.710
 avoid this kind of thing that ricky the 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.020
 steps of your property with the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.689
 investment in irrigation 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.060
 far outweigh what the producer 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:37.140
 spent in printing during the dry season a 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.120
 lame pasture mineral salt ratio 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.000
 all this makes up for 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.570
 implement the connection costs with 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.150
 electricity as the tension 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.800
 contests you pay to deploy 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.530
 there on your property 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.330
 generally pay two years 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.220
 after two years the producer will only 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.100
 have higher productivity profitability 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.530
 increased dairy productivity 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.080
 sure to leverage the profits of 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.450
 your property including your 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.970
 property does not have any mail or 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.270
 I think a dam is still possible 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.550
 you drill the well and the pumping will 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.710
 water to the reservoir of this 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.760
 reservoir you can do the irrigation 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.550
 normal 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.440
 the irrigated pasture you get the stocking 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.350
 of one animal per hectare 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.420
 to have good animals or with 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.180
 You're sure to increase your squad. 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.160
 and maintain the same pasture area 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.470
 make up for it can make your 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.720
 property is sure to leverage 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.000
 will turn your property into a 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.830
 meat and dairy factory 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.200
 This was a tip today, I ask that you 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.239

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.709
