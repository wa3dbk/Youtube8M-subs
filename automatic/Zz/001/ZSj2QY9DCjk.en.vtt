00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
specifications of the knife itself so

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.400 
specifications of the knife itself so
the<00:00:49.280> blade<00:00:49.610> is<00:00:50.090> around<00:00:50.510> like<00:00:50.900> five<00:00:51.170> inches

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
because the handle is five inches so

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
because the handle is five inches so
it's<00:00:53.570> just<00:00:54.560> under<00:00:54.860> that<00:00:55.160> but<00:00:56.080> not<00:00:57.080> by<00:00:57.290> a<00:00:57.320> whole

anyways on the blade you see you have a
half<00:01:35.810> straight<00:01:36.229> edge<00:01:36.439> and<00:01:36.649> a<00:01:36.740> half<00:01:36.889> serrated

very dull only had this knife for about
a<00:02:12.230> week<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:12.830> um<00:02:13.580> when<00:02:14.300> I<00:02:14.330> got<00:02:14.629> it<00:02:14.840> it<00:02:15.140> was

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
a week and um when I got it it was

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.449 
a week and um when I got it it was
easy<00:02:16.019> to<00:02:16.260> opening<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.250> now<00:02:18.620> yeah<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:20.099> goes<00:02:20.250> all

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
easy to opening and now yeah it goes all

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:21.979 
easy to opening and now yeah it goes all
the<00:02:20.519> way<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.790> here<00:02:21.239> before<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.719> spring

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
the way to here before the spring

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.309 
the way to here before the spring
actually<00:02:22.439> think<00:02:22.829> it<00:02:22.950> works<00:02:23.269> so<00:02:24.269> it<00:02:24.569> it's<00:02:25.079> still

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
actually think it works so it it's still

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.069 
actually think it works so it it's still
a<00:02:25.379> good<00:02:25.620> knife<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.239> spring<00:02:27.540> is<00:02:27.659> cystal

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
a good knife and the spring is cystal

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.319 
a good knife and the spring is cystal
works<00:02:28.379> but<00:02:28.709> it's<00:02:28.859> just<00:02:29.040> once<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.120> kind<00:02:30.299> of

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
works but it's just once you kind of

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.539 
works but it's just once you kind of
break<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.689> in<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:30.930> have<00:02:31.049> to<00:02:31.230> really<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:31.799> know

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
break it in you have to really you know

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.670 
break it in you have to really you know
kind<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.879> put<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.540> little<00:02:33.780> work<00:02:33.959> into<00:02:34.170> opening

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
kind of put the little work into opening

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.500

have<00:02:34.799> the<00:02:34.890> seatbelt<00:02:35.129> cutters<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:36.120> think<00:02:36.450> you

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
have the seatbelt cutters I think you

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.089 
have the seatbelt cutters I think you
would<00:02:36.629> be<00:02:36.750> much<00:02:36.959> better<00:02:37.140> off<00:02:37.260> actually<00:02:37.799> using

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
would be much better off actually using

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.069 
would be much better off actually using
your<00:02:38.129> blade<00:02:38.489> cuz<00:02:38.849> these<00:02:39.030> things<00:02:39.420> are<00:02:39.840> leaked

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
your blade cuz these things are leaked

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.140 
your blade cuz these things are leaked
it's<00:02:43.079> not<00:02:43.739> sharp<00:02:44.069> at<00:02:44.250> all<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.760> don't<00:02:44.819> I<00:02:45.090> don't

it's not sharp at all I don't I don't

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.440 
it's not sharp at all I don't I don't
know<00:02:45.530> in<00:02:46.530> what<00:02:46.799> universe<00:02:47.280> these<00:02:48.090> would<00:02:48.239> cut

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
know in what universe these would cut

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.800

break<00:03:06.389> room<00:03:06.859> but<00:03:07.859> as<00:03:07.919> far<00:03:08.099> as<00:03:08.129> design<00:03:08.400> goes<00:03:08.579> I

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
break room but as far as design goes I

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.280 
break room but as far as design goes I

and kind of checker patterns for the

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
grips the way the locking mechanism

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.039 
grips the way the locking mechanism
works<00:03:21.389> is<00:03:21.540> it's<00:03:21.690> got<00:03:21.900> this<00:03:23.569> that<00:03:24.569> pin<00:03:24.810> in<00:03:24.959> the

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
works is it's got this that pin in the

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.379 
works is it's got this that pin in the
middle<00:03:25.139> that<00:03:25.379> pops<00:03:25.620> out<00:03:25.829> when<00:03:25.889> it<00:03:26.190> opens<00:03:26.549> so

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
middle that pops out when it opens so

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.360 
middle that pops out when it opens so

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
just to close it you have to push it

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.759 
just to close it you have to push it
over<00:03:29.639> in<00:03:29.729> the<00:03:29.819> closes<00:03:30.239> as<00:03:30.930> far<00:03:31.199> as<00:03:31.319> what<00:03:31.500> side<00:03:31.739> I
