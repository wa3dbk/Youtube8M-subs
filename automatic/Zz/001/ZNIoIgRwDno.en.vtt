 sides figure a bronze dial 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.430
 these covers seem to represent 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.290
 demons holding with their hands 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.360

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:58.580
 666 meters above the level of the 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.729

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:09.050

 this monument is nothing more nor less 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:24.669
 that a 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:24.669
 tremendous tribute to lucifer to evil 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.419

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:33.319
 monument of this type in the world but 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:34.879

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:42.040

 Similar monuments in the same video 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.730
 now 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.280
 some may have doubts about which 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.800
 is a fallen angel good Christianity 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:55.229
 a fallen angel is an angel that has been 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.780
 expelled from heaven for disobeying or 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:06:00.490
 rebel against the commands of God 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.450
 the story of the Christian scriptures 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:06.580
 It collects that after said disobedience 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:10.150
 many angels were expelled the most 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:12.820
 known would be lucifer 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:15.360
 and good but since he was against 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:18.370
 of god the name was changed to satan 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.760
 and good - you do not have to be a person 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:24.970

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:28.540
 of things this monument there is this

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.670
 I tell them, you do not have to be a person 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:37.050
 religious to realize this type 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:39.330
