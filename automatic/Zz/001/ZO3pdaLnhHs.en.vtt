food it's also the easiest thing for us
to<00:00:41.399> digest<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.390> something<00:00:42.629> that

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
to digest and this is something that

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.650 
to digest and this is something that
people<00:00:43.079> often<00:00:43.829> don't<00:00:44.040> think<00:00:44.520> much<00:00:44.730> about<00:00:44.760> or

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
people often don't think much about or

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.549 
people often don't think much about or
pay<00:00:45.840> much<00:00:46.020> attention<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.590> but<00:00:47.750> there<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:49.230> law

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
pay much attention to but there is a law

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.970 
pay much attention to but there is a law
of<00:00:49.590> nature<00:00:49.739> called<00:00:51.260> Thank<00:00:52.260> You<00:00:52.410> mr.<00:00:52.710> Gekko

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
of nature called Thank You mr. Gekko

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.430 
of nature called Thank You mr. Gekko
I'll<00:00:53.460> call<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.030> law<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.239> efficiency<00:00:54.870> and

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
I'll call it the law of efficiency and

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.830 
I'll call it the law of efficiency and
the<00:00:55.530> law<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.739> efficiency<00:00:56.460> says<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.449> every

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
the law of efficiency says that every

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.560 
the law of efficiency says that every
species<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.590> always<00:00:59.100> attempting<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.850> get<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
species is always attempting to get the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.779 
species is always attempting to get the
most<00:01:00.899> benefit<00:01:01.559> for<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.160> least<00:01:02.399> amount<00:01:02.699> of

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
most benefit for the least amount of

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.640 
most benefit for the least amount of
effort<00:01:03.500> so<00:01:05.240> when<00:01:06.240> we<00:01:06.390> think<00:01:06.600> about<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.049> simple

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
effort so when we think about the simple

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.590 
effort so when we think about the simple
idea<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.369> fact<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:09.650> roughly<00:01:10.650> 50%<00:01:11.220> or<00:01:11.939> more<00:01:12.000> of

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
idea of fact that roughly 50% or more of

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.770 
idea of fact that roughly 50% or more of
your<00:01:13.260> daily<00:01:13.560> energy<00:01:13.920> goes<00:01:14.760> into<00:01:15.000> processing

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
your daily energy goes into processing

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.700 
your daily energy goes into processing
your<00:01:15.930> food<00:01:17.240> then<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.390> makes<00:01:18.600> sense<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:19.350> we

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
your food then it makes sense that we

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.320 
your food then it makes sense that we
want<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.070> be<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.310> line<00:01:20.610> with<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:21.060> law<00:01:21.210> of

want to be in line with the law of

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.670 
want to be in line with the law of
efficiency<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.840> want<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.110> be<00:01:22.170> consuming

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
efficiency you want to be consuming

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.710 
efficiency you want to be consuming
those<00:01:22.830> things<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.400> are<00:01:23.549> not<00:01:24.119> only<00:01:24.330> contained

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
those things that are not only contained

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.819 
those things that are not only contained
everything<00:01:24.960> we<00:01:25.229> need<00:01:25.500> but<00:01:26.340> also<00:01:26.610> are<00:01:27.299> easy<00:01:27.829> for

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
everything we need but also are easy for

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.340 
everything we need but also are easy for
our<00:01:28.979> bodies<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.939> get<00:01:30.150> those<00:01:30.420> things<00:01:30.659> they<00:01:31.170> have

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
our bodies to get those things they have

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.830 
our bodies to get those things they have
to<00:01:31.380> be<00:01:31.500> easy<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.950> digest<00:01:32.159> right<00:01:33.060> that's

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
to be easy to digest right that's

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.109 
to be easy to digest right that's
important<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:35.100> reason<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.579> recommend

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
important and the reason I recommend

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.600 
important and the reason I recommend
eating<00:01:36.299> mono<00:01:36.630> meals<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.650> for<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.950> same<00:01:38.159> reason

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
eating mono meals is for the same reason

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.929 
eating mono meals is for the same reason
because<00:01:39.290> when<00:01:40.290> we<00:01:40.530> eat<00:01:40.770> two<00:01:41.009> different<00:01:41.520> things

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
because when we eat two different things

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.090 
because when we eat two different things
what<00:01:42.720> we're<00:01:42.869> doing<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.259> we're<00:01:43.409> creating<00:01:43.619> an

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
what we're doing is we're creating an

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.120 
what we're doing is we're creating an
almost<00:01:44.390> impossible<00:01:45.590> problem<00:01:46.590> for<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.920> body

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
almost impossible problem for the body

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.429 
almost impossible problem for the body
let<00:01:47.880> me<00:01:47.970> illustrate<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.479> for<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.810> if<00:01:49.200> you

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
let me illustrate that for you if you

let me illustrate that for you if you
were<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.799> eat<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.220> banana

right here in my belly but what happens
if<00:02:08.959> you<00:02:09.080> eat<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.470> banana<00:02:09.800> and<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.160> grapefruit

if you eat the banana and the grapefruit

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.900 
if you eat the banana and the grapefruit

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
chemistry you'll remember that it's

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.500 
chemistry you'll remember that it's

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
the same time but that's what you would

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.250 
the same time but that's what you would
have<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:22.640> be<00:02:22.819> creating<00:02:23.510> in<00:02:23.630> order<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.110> have

have to be creating in order to have
optimal<00:02:24.950> digestion<00:02:25.430> of<00:02:25.819> those<00:02:26.510> two<00:02:26.780> very

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.449 
hit by lightning I mean if they're gonna
they're<00:02:47.840> gonna<00:02:47.900> eat<00:02:48.019> bananas<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:49.100> next<00:02:49.340> time

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
they're gonna eat bananas the next time

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:50.500 
they're gonna eat bananas the next time
they<00:02:49.610> eat<00:02:49.700> they<00:02:49.790> might<00:02:49.970> eat<00:02:50.060> something<00:02:50.360> maybe

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
they eat they might eat something maybe

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.580 
they eat they might eat something maybe
they're<00:02:50.630> eating<00:02:50.810> mangos<00:02:51.140> maybe<00:02:51.440> they're

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
they're eating mangos maybe they're

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.490 
they're eating mangos maybe they're
eating<00:02:51.830> during<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.250> reading<00:02:52.730> something<00:02:53.299> else

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
eating during and reading something else

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.960 
eating during and reading something else
but<00:02:54.500> it's<00:02:54.709> gonna<00:02:54.830> be<00:02:54.980> one<00:02:55.220> kind<00:02:55.459> of<00:02:55.549> food<00:02:55.730> and

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
but it's gonna be one kind of food and

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.699 
but it's gonna be one kind of food and
what<00:02:56.420> was<00:02:56.569> long<00:02:56.750> as<00:02:56.840> either<00:02:56.989> this<00:02:57.170> available

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
what was long as either this available

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.910 
what was long as either this available
until<00:02:58.310> they're<00:02:58.489> not<00:02:58.580> hungry<00:02:59.110> and<00:03:00.110> as<00:03:00.380> it<00:03:00.709> turns

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
until they're not hungry and as it turns

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.120 
until they're not hungry and as it turns
out<00:03:01.160> that<00:03:01.760> is<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.359> best<00:03:02.600> way<00:03:02.840> for<00:03:03.590> our<00:03:03.739> bodies

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
out that is the best way for our bodies

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.050 
out that is the best way for our bodies
as<00:03:04.280> well<00:03:04.570> because<00:03:05.570> the<00:03:06.140> more<00:03:06.410> efficiently<00:03:07.280> we

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
as well because the more efficiently we

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.060 
as well because the more efficiently we
can<00:03:08.299> digest<00:03:08.540> something<00:03:09.109> the<00:03:09.890> more

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
can digest something the more

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.190 
can digest something the more
efficiently<00:03:10.489> we<00:03:10.670> will<00:03:10.850> absorb<00:03:11.209> it<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:12.019> more

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
efficiently we will absorb it the more

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.650 
efficiently we will absorb it the more
efficiently<00:03:12.680> we<00:03:12.890> can't<00:03:13.160> assimilate<00:03:13.579> it<00:03:13.970> if

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
efficiently we can't assimilate it if

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.170 
efficiently we can't assimilate it if
we're<00:03:14.930> not<00:03:15.140> very<00:03:15.440> efficient<00:03:16.040> what<00:03:16.190> happens<00:03:16.970> is

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
we're not very efficient what happens is

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.449 
we're not very efficient what happens is
we<00:03:17.690> need<00:03:18.019> to<00:03:18.230> eat<00:03:18.380> more<00:03:18.680> food<00:03:18.950> so<00:03:19.160> all<00:03:19.310> those

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
we need to eat more food so all those

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:20.830 
we need to eat more food so all those
people<00:03:19.790> out<00:03:19.940> there<00:03:20.000> telling<00:03:20.390> you<00:03:20.510> eat<00:03:20.660> a<00:03:20.690> lot

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
people out there telling you eat a lot

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.810 
people out there telling you eat a lot

of calories maybe their bodies just

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.479

don't<00:03:23.150> work<00:03:23.299> very<00:03:23.329> well<00:03:23.690> right<00:03:24.500> because<00:03:24.890> if

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
don't work very well right because if

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.370 
don't work very well right because if
you're<00:03:25.760> not<00:03:25.790> efficient<00:03:26.510> you<00:03:26.660> will<00:03:26.900> have<00:03:27.170> to

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
you're not efficient you will have to

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.410 
you're not efficient you will have to
eat<00:03:27.500> more<00:03:27.680> calories<00:03:27.950> to<00:03:28.700> get<00:03:28.850> your<00:03:29.000> meat<00:03:29.150> needs

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 
who wants to be restricted in any way

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:03.280 
who wants to be restricted in any way
right<00:04:01.359> instead<00:04:02.359> of<00:04:02.480> restricting<00:04:02.959> yourself

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
right instead of restricting yourself

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.480

what you want to

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
so it needs fewer calories then you're

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.270 
so it needs fewer calories then you're
eating<00:04:11.510> until<00:04:11.810> you're<00:04:11.960> satisfied<00:04:12.170> right<00:04:13.160> the

the dog except the trackway it's kind of
funny<00:04:57.890> oh<00:04:58.100> but<00:04:58.760> I<00:04:58.850> could<00:04:59.060> get<00:04:59.300> I<00:04:59.330> could<00:04:59.480> finish

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
funny oh but I could get I could finish

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.130

problem if you're eating so much that

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:07.750 
problem if you're eating so much that

you can't jump up and run up the hill

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.240 
you can't jump up and run up the hill
you've<00:05:08.360> eaten<00:05:08.510> too<00:05:08.720> much<00:05:08.870> okay<00:05:09.860> you<00:05:09.920> should<00:05:10.220> be

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
you've eaten too much okay you should be

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.460 
you've eaten too much okay you should be
that's<00:05:10.520> you<00:05:11.090> shouldn't<00:05:11.450> be<00:05:11.720> eating<00:05:11.780> past<00:05:12.230> that

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:26.040 

okay<00:05:19.570> so<00:05:21.480> let's<00:05:22.480> talk<00:05:22.750> then<00:05:23.230> about<00:05:24.100> why<00:05:24.970> do<00:05:25.840> we

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
okay so let's talk then about why do we

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.840 
okay so let's talk then about why do we
not<00:05:26.320> need<00:05:26.860> to<00:05:27.400> consume<00:05:28.050> more<00:05:29.050> protein<00:05:29.890> more

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:30.850 
not need to consume more protein more

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.570 
not need to consume more protein more
minerals<00:05:31.270> right<00:05:31.690> so<00:05:32.110> first<00:05:32.260> of<00:05:32.440> all<00:05:32.580> protein

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
minerals right so first of all protein

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.000 
minerals right so first of all protein
it<00:05:33.880> turns<00:05:34.090> as<00:05:34.330> I<00:05:34.480> said<00:05:34.660> before<00:05:34.840> protein<00:05:35.830> acts

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
it turns as I said before protein acts

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.500 
it turns as I said before protein acts
as<00:05:36.160> a<00:05:36.190> stimulant<00:05:36.580> the<00:05:36.670> body<00:05:36.850> it<00:05:37.090> turns<00:05:37.300> out

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
as a stimulant the body it turns out

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.840 
as a stimulant the body it turns out
when<00:05:37.660> you<00:05:37.690> tiny<00:05:38.110> tiny<00:05:38.590> amounts<00:05:39.070> of<00:05:39.220> it<00:05:39.400> in

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
when you tiny tiny amounts of it in

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.280 
when you tiny tiny amounts of it in
order<00:05:40.000> to<00:05:40.090> get<00:05:40.240> all<00:05:40.390> of<00:05:40.480> our<00:05:40.600> needs<00:05:40.810> met<00:05:40.930> we

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
order to get all of our needs met we

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.360 
order to get all of our needs met we
don't<00:05:41.440> have<00:05:41.620> to<00:05:41.740> worry<00:05:41.890> about<00:05:42.010> getting<00:05:42.220> enough

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
don't have to worry about getting enough

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.340 
don't have to worry about getting enough
protein<00:05:42.610> it's<00:05:43.300> a<00:05:43.420> silly<00:05:43.660> idea

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 
protein it's a silly idea

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.800 
protein it's a silly idea
you<00:05:44.590> know<00:05:44.680> I<00:05:44.710> constantly<00:05:45.550> see<00:05:46.000> vegans<00:05:46.480> saying

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
you know I constantly see vegans saying

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.710 
you know I constantly see vegans saying
well<00:05:47.800> how<00:05:48.250> do<00:05:48.310> I<00:05:48.400> get<00:05:48.460> enough<00:05:48.760> protein<00:05:48.910> you

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
well how do I get enough protein you

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.540 
well how do I get enough protein you

vegans<00:05:51.910> but<00:05:52.180> how<00:05:52.270> do<00:05:52.330> I<00:05:52.390> get<00:05:52.510> an<00:05:52.600> approach<00:05:52.840> me

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
vegans but how do I get an approach me

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.870 
vegans but how do I get an approach me
if<00:05:53.050> I'm<00:05:53.140> not<00:05:53.260> eating<00:05:53.530> meat<00:05:53.680> if<00:05:54.640> you're<00:05:54.760> not

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
eating meat why would you need to make

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.960 
eating meat why would you need to make
up<00:05:56.320> the<00:05:56.470> protein<00:05:56.890> you<00:05:57.430> weren't<00:05:57.670> supposed<00:05:57.910> to
