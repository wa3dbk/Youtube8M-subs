 anniversary of the first shock 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.920
 to start doing our paper we're going 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.920
 to make a small raspberry coulis 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.960
 this is to give it a special touch 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.330
 inside the cake we will place in a 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.690
 ollita 125 grams of raspberries 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.600
 frozen or fresh as it is then 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.280
 let's put about 2 tablespoons of 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.160
 sugar 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.590
 Now let's put this on medium fire 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.630
 until the raspberries fall apart 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.110
 ok with the sugar fish and this as 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.679
 kind about 5 or 10 minutes then we're going 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.959
 to strain this raspberry pill in 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.840
 a very fine finite colander up 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:17.670
 get only the juice we're going to 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.670
 reserve it and wait for it to cool 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.019
 tasted the orange blossom water the water 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:27.280
 orange blossom is widely used in the kitchen of the 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:30.469
 middle east of the arab cuisine is 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.620
 Delicious in desserts gives it a scent 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:35.239
 super spectacular obviously if you use 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.970
 a lot knows how that if it were 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.300
 eating perfume 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.780
 but with the right touch is only 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.030
 a little smell that comes to you and is delicious 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.060
 and it's really serious what it gives the 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.860
 desserts is a spectacular thing too 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:56.440
 we will be using a beautiful 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.410
 edible flowers that will give you a 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:04.090
 very special touch to our cake and what 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:06.280
 they're going to do even more perfect for 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.230
 that we celebrate this fourth anniversary 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.230
 chocolate pepper 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.159
 now if we start doing our 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:18.620
 cake let's separate the eggs 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:20.689
 we need 12 egg whites so 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.879
 make sure to separate the eggs in 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:25.129
 or one by one, it will not do 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:28.459
 an egg goes wrong or all are damaged 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:31.040
 the whites that are boxes and that separate 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.230
 Take them carefully if you separate the eggs 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.840
 cold while the cold eggs are 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.519
 much easier now let's place 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.870
 all the clear ones in the flight of the 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.849
 blender to beat we are going to 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.909
 put a spoonful of cream 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.739
 tartar to get them up faster and 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:51.030
 then we are going to add a little bit to 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:55.080
 little bit all the sugar 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:58.970
 let's start beating at a slow and 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.970
 then we are going to increase the speed 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.010
 I like to add sugar 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.520
 spoonful in spoonful because that's how I 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.740
 I assure that it dissolves well and apart 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.170
 the whites are mounted much better than 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.330
 if you put it all in one blow no 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.790
 then it's a little more laborious 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.340
 but you 're always going to get some clear 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.290
 perfectly mounted like this when you see 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.780
 that the egg whites are so super super 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.540
 divine well assembled let's add 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.220
 a spoonful of vanilla in this case 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.920
 is using vanilla paste because 'no 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.690
 mona premiering vanilla but you can 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.060
 place normal vanilla essence 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.920
 Now let's add two tablespoons 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.440
 of orange blossom water this is fine 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.570
 important mine is not so strong like that 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:47.030
 that I can add two if yours 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.030
 it's very very strong just add a little bit 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.270
 let's transfer the culin or raspberry 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:58.409
 to a bigger little boat and now we're going to 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:02.189
 Mix all the dry ingredients and 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:03.810
 we are going to hover over our clear 

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:07.560
 I'm going to do it 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.930
 in several runs because I think it's going 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.180
 incorporating them little by little is the best 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:16.770
 method so that it is not simple to mix 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:20.759
 to see if you see the tender ones on the 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:23.139
 clear so that the flour thus has 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:24.849
 a lot more air 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.889
 the amounts of the dry ingredients 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:27.819
 you can see them here in the 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:31.870
 description of the video 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:34.449
 Now we are going to add about 3 tablespoons 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.779
 of the mixture to our pasta 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:39.879
 good raspberry 4 to our pasta 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:42.699
 raspberry and without loosing the 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:44.199
 I'm going to stir it very well because 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:47.710
 because what he's going to do is that I'm going to 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:50.259
 place this on the cake to give as 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:53.560
 veins of color now I'm going to put it in 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:56.349
 the mold important the mold this time not 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:59.229
 it's neither greased nor floured 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:01.270
 just like this mold is special for 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:04.060
 angel food cake you can do it in 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.759
 any other mold but never what in 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.340
 flour ok let's go adding the veins 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:12.219
 of color so the sprays with a 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:14.289
 spoon then we add back the 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:17.229
 white mix and so we go 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:21.460
 combining the color now let's 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:25.270
 bake our delicious cake to 180 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:27.040
 degrees centigrade for around 45 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:29.530
 minutes 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.680
 while our cake is baked we are going 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:35.530
 to go making the cover in the sugar 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:39.040
 We are going to add little by little the 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:41.800
 orange blossom water and the rest of the 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:45.040
 liquids that are vanilla juice 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:47.080

 when our cake is ready what 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:05.010
 we are going to place it face down on a 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:07.110
 waxed paper so that it cools then 

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:10.740
 We are going to unmold it with a knife 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:14.810
