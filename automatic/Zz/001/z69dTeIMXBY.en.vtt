 Hey, kitty, this is my garbage! Get out of there! 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.560
 Hoho what? Look at this cute cat face! Cooooook soft! 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.850
 What is your name? I don't even know! I'm going to call you the Incredible Kitty because you look exactly like that! 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.680
 We don't have a cat. 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.810
 Lüüüüttfeeeeeeee that? 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.470
 I don't even see what you're doing, you know I had surgery. 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.770
 Oh, man, I feel sorry for you because this cat is so cute! HOW TO BE SHORT! 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.020
 Oh yeah, it feels soft. And cold in a weird way. 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.350
 Let's take this cat for a test drive! 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.770
 What does that mean? 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.640
 That means women love cats! Cats! Cats! Cats! Cats! 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.350
 Red? Wait! Marco! Marco? 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.970
 ¡Azul, mira! Dos chicas jalapeños. 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:06.520
 Oh, my God, a very cute cat! Oh, my heart is melting. MY HEART HAPPENS! OH MY GOD! 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.680
 Oh, fuck! 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.600
 Red? What happened? I hear the siren sounds! 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.470
 You don't hear anything! 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.890
 Hey, is he okay? 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.350
 Hey, is he okay? 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.350
 Wait. Are we running towards the sirens? 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.140
 And if you look at your left, you'il see ... 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.560
 Oh, no, there's a parade! 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.890
 What did I tell you about having pets in the apartment? 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.560
 Mr. Dingleberry, look elsewhere! 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.020
 Huh? What's going on? Mr. Dingleberry? 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.600
 Oh, haha, just threw a sack of potatoes down the stairs! Those Irish people like their potatoes. 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.430
 I heard the sounds of death and secrets here. Is everything okay? 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:13.060
 You're so cute ... for this world. I have to destroy you! See you, Amazing Kitty. 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.520
 Go all the way up, asshole! 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.000
 Yeah, yeah, I'm going-- Wait, what? 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
