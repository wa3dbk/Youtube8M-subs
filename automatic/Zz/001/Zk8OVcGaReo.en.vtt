in rat poison it's it's impressed asides
so<00:02:25.570> it<00:02:25.720> is<00:02:25.840> obviously<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.380> poison<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:26.950> they're

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
so it is obviously a poison and they're

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.980 
so it is obviously a poison and they're
putting<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:27.430> into<00:02:27.580> our<00:02:27.670> water<00:02:27.970> world<00:02:28.690> health
