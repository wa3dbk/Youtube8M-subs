00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
drifting 60 amp speed controller and I'm

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.410 
drifting 60 amp speed controller and I'm
just<00:00:38.460> using<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:39.059> Traxxas<00:00:40.070> tqi<00:00:41.270> receiver<00:00:42.270> and

just using a Traxxas tqi receiver and
transmitter<00:00:42.829> and<00:00:43.829> there's<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.010> soft<00:00:44.250> back<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.670> I

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
transmitter and there's a soft back so I

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.920 
transmitter and there's a soft back so I
like<00:00:44.850> it's<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.059> bit<00:00:45.180> lighter<00:00:47.270> anyway<00:00:48.270> my

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.630 
wide wide angle drive shafts now what I
would<00:05:48.060> recommend<00:05:48.180> is<00:05:48.990> there<00:05:49.860> you<00:05:50.490> don't

really have the ribs to even you know
hate<00:05:54.120> the<00:05:54.240> internet<00:05:54.660> that<00:05:54.990> hard<00:05:55.229> so<00:05:56.040> I

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
hate the internet that hard so I

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.159 
hate the internet that hard so I
wouldn't<00:05:56.610> even<00:05:57.000> bother<00:05:57.210> with<00:05:57.419> the<00:05:57.540> fan<00:05:57.780> unless

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
wouldn't even bother with the fan unless

00:05:58.169 --> 00:05:59.450 
wouldn't even bother with the fan unless
you<00:05:58.320> want<00:05:58.500> to<00:05:58.530> unless<00:05:58.740> you're<00:05:58.979> not<00:05:59.040> you<00:05:59.340> know

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
you want to unless you're not you know

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.770 
you want to unless you're not you know
initially<00:05:59.640> wanted<00:05:59.970> to<00:06:00.030> look<00:06:00.180> cool<00:06:00.240> suck<00:06:00.660> out

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
initially wanted to look cool suck out

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:01.940 
initially wanted to look cool suck out
the<00:06:00.900> bottle<00:06:01.169> or<00:06:01.290> something<00:06:01.530> like<00:06:01.590> that

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:01.950 
the bottle or something like that

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.280 
the bottle or something like that
all<00:06:02.640> these<00:06:02.880> hubs<00:06:03.210> I<00:06:03.479> actually<00:06:03.720> think<00:06:04.080> the

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.290 
all these hubs I actually think the

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.020 
all these hubs I actually think the
standard<00:06:04.800> ones<00:06:05.010> work<00:06:05.430> better<00:06:05.729> for<00:06:05.970> some

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
standard ones work better for some

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.320 
standard ones work better for some
reason<00:06:06.570> like<00:06:06.780> it's<00:06:07.020> yeah<00:06:07.919> let's<00:06:08.669> top<00:06:08.940> and<00:06:09.180> hit

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
reason like it's yeah let's top and hit

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.029 
reason like it's yeah let's top and hit
this<00:06:09.510> this<00:06:09.780> piece<00:06:10.020> in<00:06:10.140> here<00:06:10.289> the<00:06:10.380> holes<00:06:10.620> a<00:06:10.919> lot

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 
this this piece in here the holes a lot

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:12.429 
this this piece in here the holes a lot
bigger<00:06:11.430> than<00:06:11.460> you<00:06:12.210> know

00:06:12.429 --> 00:06:12.439 
bigger than you know

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:16.689 
bigger than you know
then<00:06:13.039> the<00:06:13.729> standard<00:06:15.309> for<00:06:16.309> the<00:06:16.369> standard

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:16.699 
then the standard for the standard

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:19.629 
then the standard for the standard
inserts<00:06:17.149> so<00:06:17.559> it's<00:06:18.559> just<00:06:18.709> I<00:06:18.979> don't<00:06:19.249> know<00:06:19.399> I<00:06:19.610> just

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:19.639 
inserts so it's just I don't know I just

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:21.009 
inserts so it's just I don't know I just
don't<00:06:19.999> like<00:06:20.149> it<00:06:20.360> I<00:06:20.419> just<00:06:20.449> think<00:06:20.719> that<00:06:20.899> the

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:21.019 
don't like it I just think that the

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:23.379 
don't like it I just think that the
standard<00:06:21.499> hubs<00:06:22.189> better<00:06:22.729> but<00:06:22.909> you<00:06:22.969> definitely

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:23.389 
standard hubs better but you definitely

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:25.439 
standard hubs better but you definitely
need<00:06:23.569> a<00:06:23.779> knuckles<00:06:24.349> in<00:06:24.529> the<00:06:24.619> wide<00:06:24.800> angle<00:06:24.979> are

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:25.449 
need a knuckles in the wide angle are

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:29.949 
need a knuckles in the wide angle are
the<00:06:26.449> wide<00:06:26.629> angle<00:06:26.809> driveshaft<00:06:28.689> anyway<00:06:29.689> I<00:06:29.719> hope

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:29.959 
the wide angle driveshaft anyway I hope

00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:32.469 
the wide angle driveshaft anyway I hope
that<00:06:30.289> I<00:06:30.739> hope<00:06:31.129> that<00:06:31.159> helps<00:06:31.610> helps<00:06:32.089> us<00:06:32.209> help

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479
