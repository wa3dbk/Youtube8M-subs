Out jumps good old Santa Claus.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.650
Down thro' the chimney with lots of toys,

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.930
All for the little ones, Christmas joys.

Oh, dear Santa, fill it well;

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.520
Give her a dollie that laughs and cries,

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.110
One that will open and shut her eyes.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.450
Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn’t go!

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.840
Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn’t go!

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.560

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.370
Oh, just see whata glorious fill

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.640
Here is a hammer and lots of tacks

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.360
Also a ball and a whip that cracks.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.690
Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn’t go!

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.280
