00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.030 
going to be my n64 collection and I
think<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.780> quite<00:00:37.020> possibly<00:00:37.079> my<00:00:37.590> biggest

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
think this is quite possibly my biggest

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.020 
think this is quite possibly my biggest
collection<00:00:39.770> mmm<00:00:40.770> pretty<00:00:41.219> close<00:00:41.520> if<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:41.879> not

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
collection mmm pretty close if it's not

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.319

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.849 
I think it's actually going to be
probably<00:00:49.120> tied<00:00:49.589> with<00:00:50.589> the<00:00:50.739> S&amp;S<00:00:52.679> it's<00:00:53.679> gonna<00:00:53.769> be

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:53.859 
probably tied with the S&amp;S it's gonna be

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:55.259 
probably tied with the S&amp;S it's gonna be
very<00:00:53.890> close<00:00:54.219> anyway<00:00:54.640> let's<00:00:54.789> get<00:00:54.909> that<00:00:55.000> let's
