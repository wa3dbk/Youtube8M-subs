real quick put it in twist a lock that's
ready<00:00:55.760> for<00:00:55.850> when<00:00:56.149> I<00:00:56.180> put<00:00:56.390> the<00:00:56.480> wood<00:00:56.629> trim<00:00:56.809> back

ready for when I put the wood trim back
in<00:00:57.230> then<00:00:57.649> you<00:00:58.520> have<00:00:58.730> two<00:00:59.390> Phillips<00:00:59.809> head

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
in then you have two Phillips head

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:00.990 
in then you have two Phillips head
screws

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
screws

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.580 
screws
looks<00:01:02.000> like<00:01:02.180> one's<00:01:02.420> missing<00:01:02.690> it's<00:01:03.230> the<00:01:03.350> first

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
looks like one's missing it's the first

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.139 
looks like one's missing it's the first
time<00:01:03.739> I've<00:01:03.920> taken<00:01:04.100> this<00:01:04.399> will<00:01:04.610> trim<00:01:04.820> out<00:01:05.000> on

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
time I've taken this will trim out on

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.700 
time I've taken this will trim out on
this<00:01:07.180> 46<00:01:08.180> so<00:01:08.509> I<00:01:08.750> have<00:01:08.990> no<00:01:09.140> idea<00:01:09.500> that

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
this 46 so I have no idea that

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.200 
this 46 so I have no idea that
somebody's<00:01:10.190> been<00:01:10.399> in<00:01:10.430> here<00:01:12.070> but<00:01:13.070> you<00:01:14.030> will

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
somebody's been in here but you will

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.260 
somebody's been in here but you will
have<00:01:14.360> two<00:01:14.660> screws<00:01:15.050> one<00:01:15.649> and<00:01:15.830> two<00:01:16.060> and<00:01:17.060> then

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
have two screws one and two and then

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:24.400 
have two screws one and two and then
this<00:01:17.479> is<00:01:17.630> actually<00:01:17.990> going<00:01:18.080> to<00:01:18.200> slide<00:01:18.440> out<00:01:23.410> if

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
this is actually going to slide out if

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.230 
this is actually going to slide out if
you<00:01:24.560> take<00:01:24.770> a<00:01:24.800> pry<00:01:25.130> tool<00:01:25.369> and<00:01:25.399> go<00:01:25.700> gently

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
you take a pry tool and go gently

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.350 
you take a pry tool and go gently
underneath<00:01:26.569> plug<00:01:27.500> it<00:01:27.709> in<00:01:27.970> lift<00:01:28.970> it<00:01:29.090> up<00:01:29.240> a

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
underneath plug it in lift it up a

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.949 
underneath plug it in lift it up a
little<00:01:29.539> bit<00:01:30.459> separates<00:01:31.459> it

00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:31.959 
little bit separates it

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:36.969 
little bit separates it
this<00:01:32.959> unit<00:01:33.349> slides<00:01:33.649> out<00:01:33.920> like<00:01:33.950> this<00:01:35.920> now<00:01:36.920> you

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
this unit slides out like this now you

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.400 
this unit slides out like this now you
do<00:01:37.220> have<00:01:37.250> a<00:01:37.429> connector<00:01:37.970> here<00:01:38.080> that<00:01:39.080> you<00:01:39.259> need

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
do have a connector here that you need

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.570 
do have a connector here that you need
to<00:01:39.560> get<00:01:39.770> to<00:01:41.020> it's<00:01:42.020> one<00:01:42.259> of<00:01:42.380> those<00:01:42.470> press<00:01:43.280> style

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
to get to it's one of those press style

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.930 
to get to it's one of those press style
connectors<00:01:44.179> I<00:01:45.190> don't<00:01:46.190> think<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:46.520> harness<00:01:46.700> is

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
connectors I don't think the harness is

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.370 
connectors I don't think the harness is
going<00:01:47.000> to<00:01:47.149> let<00:01:47.330> it<00:01:47.420> come<00:01:47.569> out<00:01:47.720> anymore<00:01:48.020> than

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
going to let it come out anymore than

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.979 
going to let it come out anymore than
this<00:01:48.729> so<00:01:49.729> I<00:01:50.090> stop<00:01:50.869> there<00:01:52.750> here's<00:01:53.750> that

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:53.989 
this so I stop there here's that

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:57.400 
this so I stop there here's that
connector<00:01:54.500> this<00:01:55.039> is<00:01:55.280> an<00:01:55.429> sk<00:01:55.819> ii<00:01:55.910> style<00:01:56.410> which

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
connector this is an sk ii style which

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.279 
connector this is an sk ii style which
means<00:01:57.440> that<00:01:58.099> you<00:01:58.759> push<00:01:59.119> down<00:01:59.149> on<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.720> top<00:01:59.929> tab

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
means that you push down on the top tab

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.410 
means that you push down on the top tab
tab<00:02:00.830> and<00:02:01.270> you<00:02:02.270> need<00:02:02.420> to<00:02:02.569> slide<00:02:02.929> the<00:02:02.959> back<00:02:03.410> tab

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
tab and you need to slide the back tab

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.460 
tab and you need to slide the back tab
not<00:02:05.420> sure<00:02:05.599> if<00:02:05.660> we'll<00:02:05.780> be<00:02:05.899> able<00:02:05.929> to<00:02:06.140> do<00:02:06.259> that

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
not sure if we'll be able to do that

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.639 
not sure if we'll be able to do that
holding<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.429> camera<00:02:07.700> so<00:02:08.660> I'll<00:02:08.750> probably<00:02:08.959> I'm

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
holding the camera so I'll probably I'm

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:10.930 
holding the camera so I'll probably I'm
going<00:02:09.800> to<00:02:09.860> press<00:02:10.099> it<00:02:10.250> down<00:02:10.280> with<00:02:10.459> one<00:02:10.910> hand

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
going to press it down with one hand

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.089 
going to press it down with one hand
slide<00:02:11.930> this<00:02:12.110> a<00:02:12.170> little<00:02:12.379> bit<00:02:12.560> forward<00:02:12.890> and<00:02:13.010> then

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
slide this a little bit forward and then

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.690 
slide this a little bit forward and then
continue<00:02:14.349> see<00:02:15.349> I've<00:02:15.440> got<00:02:15.590> it<00:02:15.739> just<00:02:15.770> enough<00:02:16.400> so

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
continue see I've got it just enough so

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.900 
continue see I've got it just enough so
that<00:02:17.690> I<00:02:17.840> can<00:02:18.050> continue<00:02:18.440> sliding<00:02:18.830> it<00:02:19.069> over<00:02:19.610> and

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
that I can continue sliding it over and

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.150 
that I can continue sliding it over and
that<00:02:20.260> actually<00:02:21.260> unlocks<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.890> connector

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
that actually unlocks the connector

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.120 
that actually unlocks the connector
this<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.680> lamp<00:02:25.680> control<00:02:26.130> module<00:02:27.200> so<00:02:28.200> your

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
this is the lamp control module so your

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.090 
this is the lamp control module so your
VIN<00:02:29.760> number<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.420> your<00:02:31.110> mileage<00:02:31.350> is<00:02:31.740> stored

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
VIN number and your mileage is stored

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.310 
VIN number and your mileage is stored
redundantly<00:02:32.760> in<00:02:32.970> this<00:02:33.180> control<00:02:34.170> unit<00:02:35.810> also<00:02:36.810> if

redundantly in this control unit also if

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.130 
redundantly in this control unit also if
you<00:02:37.440> want<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.710> remove<00:02:37.980> this<00:02:38.220> vent<00:02:38.870> so<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:39.960> can

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
you want to remove this vent so you can

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.080 
you want to remove this vent so you can
see<00:02:40.350> in<00:02:40.440> there<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.650> little<00:02:40.860> bit<00:02:40.980> better<00:02:41.160> this

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
see in there a little bit better this

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.560 
see in there a little bit better this
also<00:02:42.540> has<00:02:42.720> two<00:02:43.080> Phillips<00:02:43.770> screws<00:02:44.570> this

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
also has two Phillips screws this

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.250 
also has two Phillips screws this
vehicle<00:02:46.020> only<00:02:46.140> has<00:02:46.440> one<00:02:47.750> but<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:48.840> should<00:02:48.900> have

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
vehicle only has one but it should have

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.390 
vehicle only has one but it should have
two<00:02:49.820> one<00:02:50.820> on<00:02:50.970> each<00:02:51.150> side<00:02:51.710> so<00:02:52.710> I'll<00:02:52.830> also<00:02:53.010> add

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
two one on each side so I'll also add

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.310 
two one on each side so I'll also add
this<00:02:53.820> you<00:02:54.480> know<00:02:54.600> removing<00:02:54.960> the<00:02:55.260> vent<00:02:56.420> and<00:02:57.420> the

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
this you know removing the vent and the

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.630 
this you know removing the vent and the
light<00:02:58.470> switch<00:02:58.680> Center<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.460> one<00:03:01.250> just<00:03:02.250> lift<00:03:02.490> up

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
light switch Center and one just lift up

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.060 
light switch Center and one just lift up
breaks<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.180> free<00:03:04.070> wiggle<00:03:05.070> it<00:03:05.190> out<00:03:06.920> just<00:03:07.920> like

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
breaks it free wiggle it out just like

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:16.490 
breaks it free wiggle it out just like
that<00:03:09.050> flip<00:03:10.050> that<00:03:10.260> aside<00:03:15.230> that's<00:03:16.230> the

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
that flip that aside that's the

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.230 
that flip that aside that's the
connector<00:03:16.980> right<00:03:17.370> there<00:03:17.430> for<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.030> lamp

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
connector right there for the lamp

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.880 
connector right there for the lamp
control<00:03:18.600> module<00:03:18.990> which<00:03:19.140> popped<00:03:19.410> up<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.740> little

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
control module which popped up a little

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.130 
control module which popped up a little
bit<00:03:20.100> so<00:03:20.970> I<00:03:21.060> can<00:03:21.240> go<00:03:21.330> ahead<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:21.600> slide<00:03:21.780> this<00:03:21.960> out

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
bit so I can go ahead and slide this out

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:30.320 
bit so I can go ahead and slide this out
now<00:03:25.220> so<00:03:26.220> I<00:03:26.280> got<00:03:26.430> a<00:03:26.460> leaf<00:03:26.670> in<00:03:26.850> there<00:03:29.120> you<00:03:30.120> can

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
now so I got a leaf in there you can

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.360 
now so I got a leaf in there you can
check<00:03:30.540> your<00:03:30.690> pins<00:03:31.020> make<00:03:31.620> sure<00:03:31.830> you<00:03:32.070> don't<00:03:32.160> have

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
check your pins make sure you don't have

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:39.140 
check your pins make sure you don't have
any<00:03:32.580> corrosion<00:03:37.190> this<00:03:38.190> module<00:03:38.700> does<00:03:38.910> need<00:03:39.120> to

any corrosion this module does need to

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.180 
any corrosion this module does need to
be<00:03:39.270> programmed<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:40.320> can<00:03:40.440> see<00:03:40.650> it's<00:03:40.800> actually

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
be programmed you can see it's actually

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.600 
be programmed you can see it's actually
just<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.580> circuit<00:03:41.910> board<00:03:42.060> inside<00:03:43.220> once<00:03:44.220> replace

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
just a circuit board inside once replace

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.280 
just a circuit board inside once replace
it<00:03:44.790> does<00:03:44.940> need<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.150> be<00:03:45.240> programmed<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:45.900> coded

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
it does need to be programmed and coded

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.680 
it does need to be programmed and coded
you<00:03:47.100> can't<00:03:47.430> take<00:03:47.760> this<00:03:47.910> from<00:03:48.060> another<00:03:48.330> car

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
you can't take this from another car

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.720 
you can't take this from another car
without<00:03:49.080> setting<00:03:49.650> a<00:03:49.740> manipulation<00:03:50.220> dot<00:03:50.580> in

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
without setting a manipulation dot in

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.580 
without setting a manipulation dot in
the<00:03:50.820> instrument<00:03:51.060> cluster<00:03:51.270> because<00:03:51.720> the

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
the instrument cluster because the

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.130 
the instrument cluster because the
mileage<00:03:53.070> is<00:03:53.250> and<00:03:53.520> the<00:03:53.850> VIN<00:03:54.030> will<00:03:54.330> not<00:03:54.540> match<00:03:54.810> so

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
mileage is and the VIN will not match so

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.530 
mileage is and the VIN will not match so
you'll<00:03:55.890> actually<00:03:56.070> get<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.430> little<00:03:57.030> dot<00:03:57.240> if

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
you'll actually get a little dot if

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.660 
you'll actually get a little dot if
you're<00:03:57.720> looking<00:03:58.050> for<00:03:58.230> that<00:03:58.440> we'd<00:03:59.160> be<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.370> little

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
you're looking for that we'd be a little

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.480 
you're looking for that we'd be a little
dot<00:03:59.880> by<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.209> mileage<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:01.290> it<00:04:02.130> would<00:04:02.310> mean

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
dot by the mileage and it would mean

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.800 
dot by the mileage and it would mean
that<00:04:02.520> somebody's<00:04:03.180> either<00:04:03.330> swapped<00:04:03.690> the

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
that somebody's either swapped the

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.590 
that somebody's either swapped the
instrument<00:04:04.200> cluster<00:04:04.290> or<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:06.000> lamp<00:04:06.209> control

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
instrument cluster or the lamp control

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.140 
instrument cluster or the lamp control
module<00:04:07.080> so<00:04:07.830> the<00:04:08.010> mileage<00:04:08.370> is<00:04:08.459> wouldn't<00:04:08.970> match

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
module so the mileage is wouldn't match

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.460 
module so the mileage is wouldn't match
and<00:04:09.780> you'll<00:04:10.230> have<00:04:10.770> that<00:04:10.980> manipulation<00:04:11.550> dot

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
and you'll have that manipulation dot

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.360 
and you'll have that manipulation dot
reinstalling<00:04:13.470> you're<00:04:13.740> just<00:04:13.920> going<00:04:14.040> to<00:04:14.100> slide

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
reinstalling you're just going to slide

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.580 
reinstalling you're just going to slide
it<00:04:14.400> back<00:04:14.670> in<00:04:14.910> you<00:04:15.150> do<00:04:15.330> have<00:04:15.360> to<00:04:15.660> get<00:04:15.870> the

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
it back in you do have to get the

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.270 
it back in you do have to get the
connector<00:04:17.660> to<00:04:18.660> line<00:04:18.900> up<00:04:19.140> so<00:04:19.709> you<00:04:19.830> can<00:04:19.980> kind<00:04:20.220> of

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
connector to line up so you can kind of

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.360 
connector to line up so you can kind of
work<00:04:20.430> that<00:04:20.670> in<00:04:20.850> first<00:04:21.530> get<00:04:22.530> that<00:04:22.590> connector<00:04:23.250> in

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
work that in first get that connector in

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.600 
work that in first get that connector in
place<00:04:24.140> once<00:04:25.140> that<00:04:25.380> connector<00:04:25.830> is<00:04:25.890> in<00:04:26.040> place

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.020 

and<00:04:29.610> you<00:04:30.090> just<00:04:30.120> have<00:04:30.510> to<00:04:30.690> push<00:04:31.080> it<00:04:31.200> down<00:04:31.410> and

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
and you just have to push it down and

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.790 
and you just have to push it down and
you<00:04:33.030> can<00:04:33.360> actually<00:04:33.540> do<00:04:33.900> it<00:04:34.020> from<00:04:34.229> further<00:04:34.530> in

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
you can actually do it from further in

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.770 
you can actually do it from further in
when<00:04:35.610> you<00:04:35.729> push<00:04:35.970> down<00:04:36.240> on<00:04:36.270> that

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
when you push down on that

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.280 
when you push down on that
nectar<00:04:37.170> I<00:04:38.300> want<00:04:39.300> to<00:04:39.420> do<00:04:39.510> it<00:04:39.630> so<00:04:39.750> you<00:04:39.840> can<00:04:39.990> see<00:04:40.170> it

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
nectar I want to do it so you can see it

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.560 
nectar I want to do it so you can see it
though<00:04:40.470> that's<00:04:41.430> a<00:04:41.610> lot<00:04:41.760> better<00:04:41.910> give<00:04:42.540> that

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
though that's a lot better give that

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.060 
though that's a lot better give that
harness<00:04:43.500> the<00:04:43.620> tug<00:04:43.830> it<00:04:43.980> actually<00:04:44.280> came<00:04:44.490> out<00:04:45.050> so

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
harness the tug it actually came out so

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.350 
harness the tug it actually came out so
when<00:04:47.070> you're<00:04:47.190> putting<00:04:47.370> these<00:04:47.520> two<00:04:47.790> together

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.510 

obviously<00:04:51.360> have<00:04:51.900> like<00:04:52.110> a<00:04:52.139> locator<00:04:52.680> key<00:04:52.980> just

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
obviously have like a locator key just

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.540 
obviously have like a locator key just
slide<00:04:53.760> it<00:04:53.910> in<00:04:54.060> when<00:04:54.630> you<00:04:54.660> push<00:04:54.990> it<00:04:55.139> down<00:04:55.550> then

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
slide it in when you push it down then

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.300 
slide it in when you push it down then
you<00:04:56.700> slide<00:04:57.090> the<00:04:57.120> connector<00:04:57.800> to<00:04:58.800> lock<00:04:59.010> it<00:04:59.190> into

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
you slide the connector to lock it into

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.610 
you slide the connector to lock it into
place<00:04:59.660> and<00:05:00.660> then<00:05:00.930> just<00:05:01.730> have<00:05:02.730> to<00:05:02.760> slide<00:05:03.120> it<00:05:03.270> in

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
place and then just have to slide it in

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.030 
place and then just have to slide it in
and<00:05:04.620> it<00:05:04.740> locks<00:05:04.980> right<00:05:05.130> in<00:05:06.620> put<00:05:07.620> your<00:05:07.800> screw

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
and it locks right in put your screw

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.070 
and it locks right in put your screw
back<00:05:08.220> in<00:05:09.410> screws<00:05:10.410> up<00:05:10.740> if<00:05:10.980> you<00:05:11.160> have<00:05:11.370> to<00:05:11.930> then<00:05:12.930> we

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
back in screws up if you have to then we

to side for the airflow is broken you

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.580 
to side for the airflow is broken you
would<00:05:33.240> have<00:05:33.330> to<00:05:33.450> replace<00:05:33.690> this<00:05:33.990> as<00:05:34.169> a<00:05:34.260> complete

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
would have to replace this as a complete

would have to replace this as a complete

screw<00:05:44.910> for<00:05:45.180> this<00:05:45.330> vehicle<00:05:45.870> but<00:05:46.700> that's<00:05:47.700> not

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
screw for this vehicle but that's not

going<00:05:48.270> anywhere<00:05:48.510> with<00:05:48.840> one<00:05:49.050> screw<00:05:49.290> so<00:05:49.680> no<00:05:49.890> big

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
going anywhere with one screw so no big

going anywhere with one screw so no big
deal<00:05:51.470> then<00:05:52.470> you<00:05:52.500> do<00:05:52.770> have<00:05:52.800> to<00:05:53.039> install<00:05:53.340> your
