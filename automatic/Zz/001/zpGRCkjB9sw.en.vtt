00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.150
 The helm ferries have chills, run, play, 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.390
 dances, donkeys, what does that mean? 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.359
 They do a lot of things, they have their own body language. 

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:13.499
 Let's see! 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:17.429
 The body temperature of ferrets is higher than ours, 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:22.039
 their normal temperature is somewhere at 39 degrees, so, 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.489
 when it's cold, or when it adjusts its temperature less when sleeping for example, 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.109
 is very normal 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.119
 to tremble like this. 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.030
 You do not have to worry if you notice it has a normal temperature, 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.200
 that is not too hot, 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.640
 because trembling, of course, may be a sign of fever, but it has trembled 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.430
 is absolutely normal among ferrets, they do it all to grow 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.760
 body temperature. 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.780
 The carpet: 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.590
 what a ferret sends us when 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.890
 when it sticks to the ground? 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.850
 That he is very hot! The ferrets wear a fur coat all the time, 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.109
 and obviously, 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.549
 keeping them high. When they stick to the ground, 

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:06.600
 trying to cool his belly. So 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.070
 when a ferret stretches and sticks to its belly, it means it's hot. 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.430
 You can spray it with water! 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.420
 Normally, when I grab a piece of skin on her neck, 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.080
 you will head because a vagal reflex is triggered, 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.000
 stimulating a nerve that causes frequent and frequent heart rate 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.820
 respiratory 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.420
 to decrease, making the animal caste. 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.890
 Something about joking about to tell you is opening up 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.770
 mouth 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.630
 beast, 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.170
 just now does not want to cast to make me shame, but it's very common 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.280
 to smash when we grab the skin on the back of the neck, and well, 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.050
 when they are sleepy, 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.840
 and when they are tired, just like us. 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.970
 What is the significance of the damned tail? 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.950
 The barking tail is specific to a ferret that explores and is afraid, 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:58.840
 who got scared, 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.100
 is a way of showing fear and lack of confidence. 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.510
 Neither should you be trusted in a ferret that has the tail so, 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:11.499
 because it can bite you. 

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:16.849
 When ferrets meet new things, they are scared very easily, 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:23.049
 and you will hear these horkaieli: 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:24.359
 In addition, 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:30.009
 it is very possible to complain when we do not want to do it bad, 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:33.239
 or, often when playing with each other, 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.559
 when they bite each other and one of them overcomes the measure, you will hear this sound: 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:43.749
 The ferret will reproduce these sounds 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:45.650
 when something unpleasant happens to him. 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.499
 And the last, the specific ferrets, the dung, 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:51.020
 when ferrets are playing, 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.970
 jump to the toes 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.819
 and sound like "doc, doc, doc". 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.370
 This sound is called "doncanit" 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.139
 is their specific sound, 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:07.370
 which we have not been able to record, but which we have tried to reproduce.
