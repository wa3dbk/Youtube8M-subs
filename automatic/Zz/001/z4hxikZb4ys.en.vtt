my on the entire time trying the most
most<00:01:24.479> possible<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.560> just<00:01:25.680> burn<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.130> down<00:01:26.280> a

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
most possible so you just burn it down a

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:34.039 
most possible so you just burn it down a
little<00:01:27.330> bit<00:01:27.479> easier<00:01:31.340> do<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:32.460> you're<00:01:32.670> 15<00:01:33.450> for

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
little bit easier do this you're 15 for

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:58.840 
little bit easier do this you're 15 for
each<00:01:34.200> side<00:01:34.439> for<00:01:34.710> 30<00:01:34.920> full<00:01:35.130> reps<00:01:36.259> when<00:01:37.259> we<00:01:37.350> say

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.280 

taking<00:01:59.850> it<00:01:59.939> easy<00:02:00.090> not<00:02:00.630> throwing<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.140> weight

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
taking it easy not throwing the weight

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.700 
taking it easy not throwing the weight
around<00:02:01.790> I'm<00:02:02.790> just<00:02:03.090> controlling<00:02:03.619> bring<00:02:04.619> it

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
around I'm just controlling bring it

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.350 
around I'm just controlling bring it
down

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
down

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.240 
down
bring<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.480> up<00:02:06.660> slow<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:10.530> free-hanging<00:02:10.920> would

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
bring it up slow the free-hanging would

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.740 
bring it up slow the free-hanging would
also<00:02:11.610> when<00:02:11.910> it's<00:02:12.030> just<00:02:12.210> dangling<00:02:12.540> at<00:02:12.720> the

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
also when it's just dangling at the

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.850 
also when it's just dangling at the
bottom<00:02:13.110> will<00:02:13.560> help<00:02:13.740> straighten<00:02:14.100> your<00:02:14.220> form

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.640 

rather<00:02:19.860> than<00:02:20.010> going<00:02:20.250> together<00:02:21.410> wait<00:02:22.410> some

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
rather than going together wait some

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.740 
rather than going together wait some
time<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.890> believe<00:02:23.400> ago<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.480> proa

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
time to believe ago and the proa

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
time to believe ago and the proa
themselves<00:02:26.780> almost<00:02:27.780> like<00:02:29.630> but<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:30.900> we<00:02:31.260> do<00:02:31.500> one

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
themselves almost like but and we do one

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.030 
themselves almost like but and we do one
at<00:02:32.070> a<00:02:32.100> time<00:02:32.960> what's<00:02:33.960> hard<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.230> do<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.590> you

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
at a time what's hard to do that you

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.090 
at a time what's hard to do that you
would<00:02:35.160> be<00:02:35.310> consider<00:02:35.970> doing<00:02:36.240> this<00:02:36.560> so<00:02:37.560> just

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
would be consider doing this so just

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.100 
would be consider doing this so just
stay<00:02:38.810> upright<00:02:40.760> control<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.850> weight<00:02:42.110> third

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
stay upright control the weight third

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:54.040 
stay upright control the weight third
