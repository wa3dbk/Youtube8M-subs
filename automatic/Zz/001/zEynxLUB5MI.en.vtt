00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello everyone with you shrimp today we 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.839
 Consider just an awesome mod with 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.630
 using which to find diamonds in 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.490
 minecraft will be much easier after all 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.620
 now thanks to this fashion you 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.780
 there will be a special device which 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.670
 shows how many blocks from you 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.640
 diamond ore is located 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.070
 which is actually very cool 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.380
 maybe many of you will say this 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.019
 the mod is very cheating but you only 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.240
 take a look at this locator's craft for 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.880
 you need to craft it 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.520
 1 diamond block is how do you know the whole 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.100
 nine diamonds and also additionally 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.230
 2 diamonds that already proves that 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.480
 craft this locator is not so 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.309
 just well and just to have it 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.890
 you only need to craft 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.829
 one time stone torches are the three most common 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.350
 stone but all let's say you grafted this 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.210
 diamond locators put it to themselves in 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.180
 inventory and there is quite 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.190
 interesting question how is it all the same 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.309
 take advantage and everything really 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.559
 very simple now i'll show you everything 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.840
 for starters let's take our 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.030
 locator in hand is fine well and now 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.520
 let's go in the very first bay and 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.409
 let's get up around this fence as 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.630
 see our locator activated 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.180
 the indicator on it lights up red 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.840
 color it means that somewhere in the radius 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.729
 6 8 blocks from where you stand 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.100
 there is diamond ore while 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.890
 it doesn't matter where the ore is 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.229
 it can be both left and right and 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.720
 above and even below the exact 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.880
 diamond location locator of course 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.100
 same does not show and it makes him 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.320
 absolutely good and not cheat 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.210
 subject okay let's go to 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.820
 the next compartment is where the diamond ore 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.619
 is a little closer to the fence like 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.930
 see now the indicator on our 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.939
 The locator has become orange in color. 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.659
 actually says that somewhere in 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.060
 a distance of 4-5 blocks is diamond 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.579
 ore well if we go to the very last 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.920
 the third compartment of the dictator in our 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.110
 locator will turn yellow and this 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.299
 means our diamonds are already somewhere 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.300
 very close but to be precise 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.520
 about two three blocks away from us 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.010
 well, the latest color that can 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.050
 show this locator is green 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.540
 It is displayed only when you 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.970
 touch the diamond ore with one 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.160
 hand this function seems very silly 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.140
 but on the other hand quite useful 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.390
 because there are situations when 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.910
 go for some cave and by chance 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.310
 you pass through the diamond ore while 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.210
 her not noticing this is really 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.820
 annoying 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.980
 looking for looking for this diamond ore 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.740
 you have already walked it five times and 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.200
 I did n't even notice her, but now thanks 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.130
 this locator more such nonsense you have 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.590
 will not occur 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.780
 well, at least I certainly have 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.240
 general if to sum up it in general 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.580
 this mod is quite useful what 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.310
 the main thing he is not St. Petersburg is in fact 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.290
 In fact, I am very happy in general, I hope that 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.840
 this mod you like it you 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.940
 someday come in handy with you 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:08.010
 shrimp subscribe to my channel 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:15.959

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:21.980
 in this npc commander on the poster himself 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:24.740
 barely well with danger and work alone 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:29.420
 pickaxe. 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:31.870
 rose to his son once i can show in like it 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.870
 up
