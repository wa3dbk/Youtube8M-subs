that I did have from Avon few years back

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.510 
that I did have from Avon few years back

buying<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.550> only<00:01:03.739> on<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.010> product

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
buying it is the only on the product

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.090 
buying it is the only on the product
that<00:01:05.549> i've<00:01:05.790> ever<00:01:06.000> used<00:01:06.260> by<00:01:07.260> simple<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.950> I've

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
that i've ever used by simple that I've

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.160 
that i've ever used by simple that I've
regretted<00:01:08.340> buying<00:01:08.850> from<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.420> second<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.960> used

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
regretted buying from the second I used

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.370 
regretted buying from the second I used
it<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:11.189> general<00:01:11.549> idea<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:11.970> if<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:13.080> do<00:01:13.200> your

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
it the general idea is if you do your

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.800 
it the general idea is if you do your
eye<00:01:13.409> makeup<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.760> smudge<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.299> something

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
eye makeup and you smudge it something

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.260 
eye makeup and you smudge it something
you<00:01:16.470> can<00:01:16.680> just<00:01:16.710> go<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.220> with<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.850> it

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
you can just go in with this and it

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.070 
you can just go in with this and it
raises<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:19.970> it<00:01:20.970> does<00:01:21.240> exactly<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.750> same<00:01:21.810> as

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
raises it it does exactly the same as

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.469 
raises it it does exactly the same as
the<00:01:22.110> air<00:01:22.290> bond<00:01:22.500> wonders<00:01:22.920> which<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.180> smudges

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
the air bond wonders which is it smudges

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.660 
the air bond wonders which is it smudges
it<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.020> doesn't<00:01:25.710> actually<00:01:25.830> remove<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.490> just

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
it it doesn't actually remove it just

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.940 
it it doesn't actually remove it just
smudge<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.530> looks<00:01:28.680> like<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.920> just

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
smudge is it so it looks like you just

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.920 
smudge is it so it looks like you just
got<00:01:29.159> black<00:01:29.700> bugs<00:01:29.970> underneath<00:01:30.450> your<00:01:30.630> eyes<00:01:30.720> or

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
got black bugs underneath your eyes or

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.429 
got black bugs underneath your eyes or
something<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:32.600> really<00:01:33.600> really<00:01:33.930> don't<00:01:34.020> like<00:01:34.140> it

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
something I really really don't like it

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.870 
something I really really don't like it
so<00:01:34.979> I'm<00:01:35.070> going<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.250> do<00:01:35.540> hopefully<00:01:36.540> an<00:01:36.750> example

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
so I'm going to do hopefully an example

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.530 
so I'm going to do hopefully an example
let<00:01:38.880> me<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.150> find<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.659> black<00:01:40.490> eyeliner<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.090> I'm

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
let me just find a black eyeliner so I'm

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.319 
let me just find a black eyeliner so I'm
gonna<00:01:42.630> use<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.960> penultimate<00:01:43.290> liner<00:01:43.680> by<00:01:43.890> Mac

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:49.730 

probably<00:01:48.329> use<00:01:48.450> too<00:01:48.600> much<00:01:48.720> there<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:48.990> say<00:01:49.710> that

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
probably use too much there but say that

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.630 
probably use too much there but say that
that's<00:01:50.009> your<00:01:50.189> eyeliner<00:01:50.720> and<00:01:52.369> this<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.520> what

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
that's your eyeliner and this is what

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.870 
that's your eyeliner and this is what
the<00:01:53.759> simple<00:01:54.119> looks<00:01:54.509> like<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.960> says<00:01:55.110> exposed<00:01:55.560> to

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
the simple looks like it says exposed to

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.149 
the simple looks like it says exposed to
clean<00:01:56.880> tip<00:01:57.149> after<00:01:57.390> use<00:01:57.780> which<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.829> have<00:01:58.979> been

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
clean tip after use which I have been

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.959 
clean tip after use which I have been
doing<00:01:59.479> which<00:02:01.219> it<00:02:02.219> doesn't<00:02:02.430> look<00:02:02.640> like<00:02:02.700> I've

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
doing which it doesn't look like I've

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.219 
doing which it doesn't look like I've
been<00:02:03.060> doing<00:02:03.299> but<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.450> have<00:02:03.600> been<00:02:03.750> cleaning<00:02:03.960> it

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
been doing but I have been cleaning it

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.850 
been doing but I have been cleaning it
so<00:02:05.040> basically

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.250 

does<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:10.979> look<00:02:11.100> like<00:02:11.160> it's<00:02:11.430> removed<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:12.260> even

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
does that look like it's removed it even

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.760 
does that look like it's removed it even
if<00:02:13.350> you<00:02:13.530> like<00:02:15.080> just<00:02:16.080> try<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.260> take<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.530> little

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
if you like just try and take a little

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:28.240 
if you like just try and take a little
bit<00:02:17.010> off<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.310> edge<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:22.260> just<00:02:22.530> smudges<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:26.000> it's

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
bit off the edge it just smudges it it's

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.540 
bit off the edge it just smudges it it's

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
I've just been doing this and then using

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.910 
I've just been doing this and then using
like<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.650> wet<00:02:59.070> wipe<00:02:59.220> on<00:02:59.460> it<00:02:59.610> and<00:03:00.620> it<00:03:01.620> still

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
like a wet wipe on it and it still

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:11.900 
like a wet wipe on it and it still
leaves<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.460> nib<00:03:03.200> day<00:03:04.280> so

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.750 

it<00:03:12.750> just<00:03:12.930> smudges<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.680> doesn't<00:03:14.040> take<00:03:14.280> anything

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
it just smudges it doesn't take anything

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.340 
it just smudges it doesn't take anything
away<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.360> then<00:03:15.480> if<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:15.750> go<00:03:15.900> back<00:03:16.080> in<00:03:16.260> again

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
that's the problem and that's the reason

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.810 
that's the problem and that's the reason
why<00:03:57.510> this<00:03:57.690> was<00:03:58.170> such<00:03:58.380> a<00:03:58.650> letdown<00:03:58.830> is<00:03:59.250> because<00:03:59.550> I

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
why this was such a letdown is because I

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.220

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
I'm afraid I think they should stick

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.130 
I'm afraid I think they should stick
