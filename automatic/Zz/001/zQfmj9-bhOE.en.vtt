00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
hello here is a tip to program your cox

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.769 
hello here is a tip to program your cox
universal<00:00:05.250> remote<00:00:05.609> if<00:00:05.790> you<00:00:06.089> don't<00:00:06.299> know<00:00:06.569> the

universal remote if you don't know the

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.980 
universal remote if you don't know the
code<00:00:07.309> sometimes<00:00:08.309> if<00:00:08.760> you<00:00:09.059> can<00:00:09.240> locate<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.630> chart

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
code sometimes if you can locate a chart

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.830 
code sometimes if you can locate a chart
it's<00:00:10.620> easier<00:00:11.130> it's<00:00:11.280> more<00:00:11.550> helpful<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:12.540> codes

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
it's easier it's more helpful the codes

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.350 
it's easier it's more helpful the codes
on<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.530> televisions<00:00:14.309> are<00:00:14.490> going<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.759> go<00:00:14.880> from

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
on the televisions are going to go from

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.400 
on the televisions are going to go from
0<00:00:15.719> all<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.170> way<00:00:16.199> up<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.800> 9<00:00:17.600> so<00:00:18.600> with<00:00:18.960> me<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.140> had

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
0 all the way up to 9 so with me I had

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.070 
0 all the way up to 9 so with me I had
bought<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.640> off-brand<00:00:20.640> television<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:21.689> it

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
bought a off-brand television so it

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.840 
bought a off-brand television so it
wasn't<00:00:22.439> even<00:00:22.680> on<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.920> chart<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.490> had<00:00:23.760> to

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
wasn't even on the chart so I had to

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.730 
wasn't even on the chart so I had to
figure<00:00:24.180> out<00:00:24.330> what<00:00:24.570> code<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:24.990> was<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.470> how<00:00:25.710> I

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
figure out what code it was and how I

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.759 
figure out what code it was and how I
did<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.279> was<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.939> located<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.050> select<00:00:28.529> button

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
did that was I located the select button

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.470 
did that was I located the select button
and<00:00:29.840> the<00:00:30.840> meet<00:00:31.019> button<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.940> held<00:00:32.940> those<00:00:33.149> down

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
and the meet button and held those down

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.290 
and the meet button and held those down
at<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.200> same<00:00:34.440> time<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.640> while<00:00:35.820> holding<00:00:36.059> those

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
at the same time and while holding those

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.720 
at the same time and while holding those
down<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.840> lights<00:00:37.050> for<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.590> TV<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.430> Cox

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
down the lights for the TV and the Cox

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.569 
down the lights for the TV and the Cox
box<00:00:39.059> came<00:00:39.510> up<00:00:39.719> they<00:00:40.680> had<00:00:40.829> those<00:00:40.980> flashed<00:00:41.370> a

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
box came up they had those flashed a

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.340 
box came up they had those flashed a
couple<00:00:41.940> times<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.570> then<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.320> press<00:00:43.649> speed<00:00:44.010> TV

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
button and then that might stayed on and

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.010 
button and then that might stayed on and
then<00:00:49.379> what<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.649> did<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:49.950> point<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.520> at<00:00:50.730> the

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
then what I did is point it at the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.479 
then what I did is point it at the
television<00:00:52.020> set<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:53.610> push<00:00:54.590> 0<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.920> that

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
television set and I push 0 and that

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.060 
television set and I push 0 and that
turned<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.879> television<00:00:57.120> off<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:58.410> I've<00:00:59.010> just

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
turned the television off so I've just

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.020 
turned the television off so I've just
got<00:00:59.520> lucky

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
got lucky

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.330 
got lucky
I<00:01:00.239> had<00:01:00.480> off-brand<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.320> then<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.739> just<00:01:01.980> started

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
I had off-brand and then I just started

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.270 
I had off-brand and then I just started
with<00:01:02.489> zero<00:01:02.910> but<00:01:03.600> if<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.840> didn't<00:01:04.140> work<00:01:04.350> out<00:01:04.650> my

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
with zero but if that didn't work out my

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.679 
with zero but if that didn't work out my
next<00:01:05.549> step<00:01:05.790> would<00:01:05.939> be<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.119> do<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.479> all<00:01:06.659> over

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
next step would be to do it all over

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.380 
next step would be to do it all over
again<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.470> strike<00:01:07.740> with<00:01:07.920> 1<00:01:08.189> all<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.909> way<00:01:08.939> up<00:01:09.060> to

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
again to strike with 1 all the way up to

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.770 
again to strike with 1 all the way up to
9<00:01:09.600> till<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.080> found<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.680> 6<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> common<00:01:12.180> number

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
9 till I found it 6 is a common number

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.190 
9 till I found it 6 is a common number
so<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.049> might<00:01:13.260> want<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.070> try<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.340> 6<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:15.200> know

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
so you might want to try it 6 I know

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.530 
so you might want to try it 6 I know
that<00:01:16.500> works<00:01:16.710> with<00:01:16.890> some<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.189> Phillips<00:01:17.580> but

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
that works with some of Phillips but

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.630 
that works with some of Phillips but
while<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.229> do<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.560> start<00:01:19.799> over<00:01:20.130> again<00:01:20.159> you

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
while you do is start over again you

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.270 
while you do is start over again you
find<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.000> select<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.840> then<00:01:22.229> mute<00:01:22.530> you'll

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
find the select and then mute you'll

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.330 
find the select and then mute you'll
hold<00:01:23.430> those<00:01:23.610> down<00:01:23.820> together<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:25.070> then<00:01:26.070> the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
hold those down together and then the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.679 
hold those down together and then the
lights<00:01:26.580> are<00:01:26.790> blink<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.180> here<00:01:27.420> for<00:01:27.630> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
lights are blink of here for the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.440 
lights are blink of here for the
television<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.470> Cox<00:01:28.710> box<00:01:29.040> they<00:01:29.850> link<00:01:30.299> a

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
television the Cox box they link a

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.880 
television the Cox box they link a
couple<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.810> times<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.350> then<00:01:31.500> you'll<00:01:31.650> hold

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
couple of times and then you'll hold

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.080 
couple of times and then you'll hold
down<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:33.119> TV<00:01:34.009> button<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.880> light

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
down the the TV button and that light

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.510 
down the the TV button and that light
will<00:01:36.299> stay<00:01:36.540> on<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.110> then<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:37.920> point<00:01:38.400> it

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
will stay on and then you just point it

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.319 
will stay on and then you just point it
at<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:39.290> television<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.470> then<00:01:41.340> start<00:01:41.850> with<00:01:42.030> 1

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
at the television and then start with 1

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.350 
at the television and then start with 1
and<00:01:42.630> maybe<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.649> turn<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.700> television<00:01:45.000> off

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
and maybe that turn the television off

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.840 
and maybe that turn the television off
now<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.290> just<00:01:46.770> repeat<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.310> all<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.700> way<00:01:47.820> up

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
now you just repeat this all the way up

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.120 
now you just repeat this all the way up
to<00:01:48.180> 9<00:01:48.390> till<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.780> find<00:01:49.079> your<00:01:49.229> code<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.100> a
