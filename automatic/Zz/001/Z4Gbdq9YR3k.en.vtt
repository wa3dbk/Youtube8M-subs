next<00:02:10.300> step<00:02:10.450> is<00:02:10.630> just<00:02:10.660> going<00:02:11.080> to<00:02:11.230> push<00:02:11.560> down<00:02:11.590> and

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
next step is just going to push down and

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.449 
next step is just going to push down and
compress<00:02:12.580> all<00:02:12.850> of<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.270> hay<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:14.010> then<00:02:15.010> you're

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
compress all of the hay and then you're

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:16.680 
compress all of the hay and then you're
just<00:02:15.490> going<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.820> want<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.000> smoosh<00:02:16.270> it<00:02:16.300> up<00:02:16.510> so

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
just going to want to smoosh it up so

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.540 
just going to want to smoosh it up so
what<00:02:16.870> I<00:02:16.900> usually<00:02:17.140> do<00:02:17.530> is<00:02:17.560> I<00:02:17.860> just<00:02:19.080> tuck<00:02:20.080> it<00:02:20.110> in

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
what I usually do is I just tuck it in

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.250 
what I usually do is I just tuck it in
like<00:02:21.550> this<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:22.090> just<00:02:22.450> keep<00:02:22.750> going<00:02:23.080> like<00:02:23.200> that

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
like this and just keep going like that

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.500 
like this and just keep going like that
like<00:02:23.680> rolling<00:02:24.040> it<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.940> when<00:02:25.090> you<00:02:25.180> get<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:25.390> the

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
like rolling it and when you get to the

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:35.280 
like rolling it and when you get to the
bottom<00:02:26.489> smoosh<00:02:27.489> it<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:34.480> it's<00:02:34.780> okay<00:02:35.050> if<00:02:35.080> it

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
bottom smoosh it and it's okay if it

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.670 
bottom smoosh it and it's okay if it
rips<00:02:35.440> in<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:35.680> few<00:02:35.860> places<00:02:36.100> like<00:02:36.489> there<00:02:36.790> because

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
rips in a few places like there because

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.600 
rips in a few places like there because
that's<00:02:38.680> just<00:02:38.800> going<00:02:38.950> to<00:02:39.040> make<00:02:39.070> it<00:02:39.250> fun<00:02:39.400> or<00:02:39.430> for

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
that's just going to make it fun or for

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.390 
that's just going to make it fun or for
your<00:02:39.730> pack<00:02:39.940> so<00:02:40.750> there<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:41.590> have<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:41.920> top<00:02:42.280> of

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
your pack so there you have the top of

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.880 
your pack so there you have the top of
your<00:02:42.489> burger<00:02:43.350> now<00:02:44.350> you're<00:02:44.500> going<00:02:44.590> to<00:02:44.680> want<00:02:44.770> to

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
your burger now you're going to want to

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.460 
your burger now you're going to want to
do<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.130> same<00:02:45.400> with<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:46.239> other<00:02:46.270> bag<00:02:46.840> but<00:02:47.320> this

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
do the same with the other bag but this

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.590 
do the same with the other bag but this
time<00:02:47.709> fill<00:02:48.040> it<00:02:48.160> a<00:02:48.280> quarter<00:02:48.640> fold<00:02:48.940> this<00:02:49.150> just

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
time fill it a quarter fold this just

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.500 
time fill it a quarter fold this just
makes<00:02:49.840> that<00:02:50.170> bottom<00:02:50.950> bun<00:02:51.640> a<00:02:51.910> little<00:02:52.330> bit

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
makes that bottom bun a little bit

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.120 
makes that bottom bun a little bit
thinner<00:02:52.840> so<00:02:53.440> it<00:02:53.620> looks<00:02:53.769> more<00:02:53.860> like<00:02:54.100> a

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
thinner so it looks more like a

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:06.360 
thinner so it looks more like a
hamburger<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:05.010> you're<00:03:06.010> going<00:03:06.100> to<00:03:06.190> want<00:03:06.280> to

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
hamburger and you're going to want to

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.650 
hamburger and you're going to want to
put<00:03:06.549> in<00:03:06.700> some<00:03:06.730> of<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.120> treatments<00:03:07.390> as<00:03:07.900> well

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
put in some of the treatments as well

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.640 
put in some of the treatments as well
but<00:03:10.660> you<00:03:10.750> don't<00:03:10.930> have<00:03:11.049> to<00:03:11.110> if<00:03:11.290> you<00:03:11.440> don't<00:03:11.590> want

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
but you don't have to if you don't want

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.390 
but you don't have to if you don't want
to<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:13.620> then<00:03:14.620> you're<00:03:14.799> just<00:03:14.829> going<00:03:15.040> to<00:03:15.130> smoosh

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
to and then you're just going to smoosh

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.770 
to and then you're just going to smoosh
it<00:03:15.430> up<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.760> same<00:03:15.940> way<00:03:16.000> that<00:03:16.269> you<00:03:16.390> did<00:03:16.510> with<00:03:16.690> the

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
it up the same way that you did with the

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.380 
it up the same way that you did with the
first<00:03:16.959> bun<00:03:17.310> okay<00:03:18.310> so<00:03:18.370> your<00:03:18.670> next<00:03:18.850> step<00:03:19.000> is<00:03:19.360> to

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
first bun okay so your next step is to

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.020 
first bun okay so your next step is to
put<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.870> sesame<00:03:20.350> seeds<00:03:20.620> on<00:03:20.799> the<00:03:20.890> top<00:03:21.220> bun<00:03:21.489> so

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
put the sesame seeds on the top bun so

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.920 
put the sesame seeds on the top bun so
you're<00:03:22.150> just<00:03:22.209> going<00:03:22.360> to<00:03:22.450> take<00:03:22.570> your<00:03:22.750> scissors

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
you're just going to take your scissors

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:30.420 
you're just going to take your scissors
like<00:03:23.350> that<00:03:23.650> and<00:03:24.090> just<00:03:27.989> stab<00:03:28.989> it<00:03:29.220> if<00:03:30.220> you're

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
like that and just stab it if you're

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.280 
like that and just stab it if you're
young<00:03:30.640> obviously<00:03:31.269> get<00:03:31.660> your<00:03:31.840> parent<00:03:32.110> to<00:03:32.170> do

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
young obviously get your parent to do

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.560 
young obviously get your parent to do
this<00:03:32.440> because<00:03:32.680> it<00:03:32.890> would<00:03:33.880> hurt<00:03:33.910> if<00:03:34.269> you<00:03:34.420> get

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
the next step that you're going to do is

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.330 
the next step that you're going to do is
grab<00:04:17.700> your<00:04:18.239> sisal<00:04:18.600> string<00:04:18.870> and<00:04:19.080> cut<00:04:20.040> off<00:04:20.130> a

grab your sisal string and cut off a
good<00:04:20.660> amount<00:04:21.660> I<00:04:21.930> usually<00:04:22.260> cut<00:04:22.470> off<00:04:22.590> like<00:04:22.830> 15

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
good amount I usually cut off like 15

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:30.890 
good amount I usually cut off like 15
centimeters<00:04:23.790> or<00:04:24.060> so<00:04:28.550> ok<00:04:29.550> so<00:04:30.270> once<00:04:30.630> you<00:04:30.750> have

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900

that now you're going to want to tie
your<00:04:34.280> hamburger<00:04:35.280> together<00:04:35.610> since<00:04:35.970> that'll

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
your hamburger together since that'll

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.220 
your hamburger together since that'll
make<00:04:36.750> the<00:04:37.490> toy<00:04:38.490> harder<00:04:38.970> to<00:04:39.210> chew<00:04:39.720> up<00:04:39.750> and

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
make the toy harder to chew up and

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:47.960 
make the toy harder to chew up and
destroy<00:04:41.210> so<00:04:42.210> just<00:04:42.890> go<00:04:43.890> like<00:04:44.130> that<00:04:44.490> and<00:04:46.970> I

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
destroy so just go like that and I

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.970 
destroy so just go like that and I
suggest<00:04:48.390> you<00:04:48.480> tying<00:04:48.810> it<00:04:48.990> pretty<00:04:49.350> tight<00:04:49.680> or
