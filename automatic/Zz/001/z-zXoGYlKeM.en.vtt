00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.210 
Saturday but it's the low top version
the<00:03:03.990> low<00:03:04.110> top<00:03:04.350> version<00:03:04.620> did<00:03:04.890> not<00:03:04.920> get<00:03:05.190> a

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
the low top version did not get a

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.980 
the low top version did not get a
general<00:03:05.550> release<00:03:05.760> only<00:03:06.240> the<00:03:06.630> high<00:03:06.780> top

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.750 
general release only the high top
version<00:03:07.350> did<00:03:07.500> so<00:03:07.950> I<00:03:07.980> like<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.340> fact<00:03:08.550> that<00:03:08.610> they

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
version did so I like the fact that they

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.340 
version did so I like the fact that they
did<00:03:08.910> that<00:03:09.090> there<00:03:09.510> was<00:03:09.630> a<00:03:09.660> couple<00:03:09.870> other<00:03:09.990> pairs

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
did that there was a couple other pairs

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.080 
did that there was a couple other pairs
that's<00:03:10.620> premiere<00:03:11.490> date<00:03:11.670> or<00:03:11.790> some<00:03:11.970> other

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
that's premiere date or some other

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.060 
that's premiere date or some other
collaborations<00:03:12.720> have<00:03:12.780> done<00:03:12.990> this<00:03:13.170> year<00:03:13.500> where

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
collaborations have done this year where

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.660 
collaborations have done this year where
they<00:03:14.550> get<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:15.360> same<00:03:15.570> exact<00:03:16.220> pair<00:03:17.220> of<00:03:17.340> sneakers

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
they get the same exact pair of sneakers

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.040 
they get the same exact pair of sneakers
but<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.060> only<00:03:18.210> difference<00:03:18.360> is<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.840> tongue

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
but the only difference is the tongue

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.320 
but the only difference is the tongue
says<00:03:19.380> premiere<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.550> other<00:03:20.670> versions<00:03:21.150> say

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
says premiere and the other versions say

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.930 
says premiere and the other versions say
SB<00:03:22.110> or<00:03:22.680> something<00:03:22.980> like<00:03:23.100> that<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.520> I<00:03:23.610> like<00:03:23.820> the

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
SB or something like that and I like the

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:24.800 
SB or something like that and I like the
fact<00:03:24.120> that<00:03:24.210> this<00:03:24.390> one

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
fact that this one

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.750 
fact that this one
it's<00:03:25.170> like<00:03:25.380> exclusive<00:03:26.100> because<00:03:26.340> they<00:03:26.520> get<00:03:26.640> the

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
it's like exclusive because they get the

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.670 
it's like exclusive because they get the
low<00:03:26.880> top<00:03:27.090> version<00:03:27.330> and<00:03:27.690> everybody<00:03:28.350> else<00:03:28.500> gets
