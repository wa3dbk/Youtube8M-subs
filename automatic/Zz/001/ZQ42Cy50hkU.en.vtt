00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.360
 hello good today I'm going to prepare some 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.550
 Macaroni with bacon a very easy dish 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.900
 and that almost everyone likes them 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.130
 ingredients that I used to be 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:30.310
 macaroni strips of bacon a piece of 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.550
 butter tomato crushed an onion 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.120
 a little salt oregano sugar and 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.120
 olive oil 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.770
 The first thing we will do is boil the 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.670
 Macaroni when the water is hot 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.670
 we will defeat them all 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.780
 I will sprinkle a pinch of salt 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.670
 and wait for them to be done and now in 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.090
 while while scratching the 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.090
 onion 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.880
 Well, after about 10 minutes 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.940
 that we look at since the macaroni already 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.530
 are we will take them out 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.530
 we will put a pan 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:30.520
 and we'll pour a little oil 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:35.009
 go heating up 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.009
 and now we will take out the macaroni 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.969
 It is a dish that almost everyone will 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.340
 I like and I really like 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:48.810
 macaroni 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.810
 Well I prepare it quite 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.880
 now we will wait for a warm 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.720
 little oil that will heat up 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.720
 pretty fast 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.649
 so when the oil is a little 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.649
 hot we will throw the grated onion 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.670
 that the onion is optional if you want it 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.990
 Take the throw and do not throw the onion 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.990
 the bacon is directly 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.550
 and now we will move it a little while 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.340
 today it's been about 7 minutes that the 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.930
 Onion is already beginning to last 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.930
 we add the bacon 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.400
 and a pinch of salt 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.050
 and we move it another couple of minutes 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.050
 minutes 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.050
 Y 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.610
 After two minutes we add the 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.610
 Crushed tomato 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.960

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.250
 I will also add 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.250
 a pinch of salt 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.580
 and another pinch of sugar 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.060
 and the oregano that the oregano to the taste of 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.000

 we need the macaroni 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:06.610
