00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.350
 that there are cules speak to them lion hunter this time I bring you a video I tell 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.330
 on a bitch was that in many games is very useless 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.599
 I'm talking about the knife 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:14.659
 ao as fucking want to call him good first of all let's see its meaning 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.189
 is a sharp blade that is articulated on the handle where the 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.869
 edge 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.869
 that bullshit are those good now I will give you my definition 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.369
 weapon that does not serve for pure fuck and that if the equipazo you are the risk of 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.119
 die 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.630
 hahaha these ex hahaha 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.710
 little is not more realistic mine 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.370
 in the first game that I want to talk about that mother is mainly in the 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.790
 series of resident evil since from the resident evil 1 every time you start 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.050
 play give you that bullshit like first weapon do not fuck me fucking programmers 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.690
 fucking why not better give you a spring 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.520
 today you lose a fucking stone 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.320
 I think it would work better to grab harris cases to a pinche tombini that 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.450
 approaching to try to navajear what 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.180
 since anyway you'll end up biting your ass in fact it's so 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.580
 useless the knife that almost always what they in the first car that 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.410
 you find 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.730
 although it has its exceptions for example in resident evil 4 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.110
 and in resident evil 5 the knife is very useful only that it thinks that 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.240
 same as me that's why in resident evil 4 does not have a knife and if they do not believe me 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.170
 ask him 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.550
 he advocated fucking knives a shit why I do not use 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.300
 in fact he does it because at the point they decide to ask for veronica is the only thing 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.100
 I brought it and that's why I got so worked up that I never touched one 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.490
 you see, I told you 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.250
 Well in fact the knife only serves to kill zombies because if 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.159
 you try with another enemy is going to make it very difficult to defeat him without leaving you 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.210
 all fucked I do not know why but the fucking cholos pinches if it works 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.070
 the knife maybe you train all your life to handle that mother and know 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.840
 all the secrets right lismo good that's his thing good let's continue 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.860
 in another game that is very useless the knife is the castlevania symphony of 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:55.430
 the night 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.920
 good although the knife is not the first lady they give you but of all 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.360
 modes is better to attack with fists or compatriot than to use that chingadera 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.880
 although if you want to fire avian one or another demon is very fun to do it 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.350
 done me in times of boredom in that game I try that good there is a game 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.510
 in which the knife is very important 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.610
 even to get the pinches bullets serve I'm talking about metal gear solid 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.810
 3 for de facto lawsuits in that game you can do several things with the 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:22.439
 knife 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:26.809
 and it serves you for several maneuvers so I'll leave that game in peace and 

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:30.909
 I will keep shitting my mother to another one although in some games they lacked the 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:31.909
 use of the knife 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.299
 for example in the videogame of 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.569
 Normally Belgians are those that a soldier without a knife is going to be doing 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.959
 Who do you think are because of this 1 who stuck learn from rambo 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.850
 that ox did seem to have the sword of tondela of the thundercats 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.329
 Well now you know that knives are almost always stupid to use 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.729
 and if the one who is watching this video is a choro and you want to make it from Pedro 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:54.799
 improve yourself 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.909
 good until the next cules I say goodbye
