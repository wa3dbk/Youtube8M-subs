00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
by adding labels let's make new label

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:34.900 
by adding labels let's make new label
called<00:05:28.790> sketches<00:05:30.920> sketches<00:05:32.450> and<00:05:33.650> give<00:05:34.650> it

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
called sketches sketches and give it

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:40.880 
called sketches sketches and give it
some<00:05:35.910> green<00:05:36.210> color<00:05:38.930> and<00:05:39.930> now<00:05:40.290> you<00:05:40.350> can<00:05:40.680> add

this<00:05:41.190> label<00:05:41.700> to<00:05:42.000> other<00:05:42.390> sketches<00:05:42.870> now<00:05:43.800> label

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
this label to other sketches now label

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.060 
this label to other sketches now label
sketches<00:05:46.190> okay<00:05:47.390> so<00:05:48.390> after<00:05:48.840> doing<00:05:48.990> that<00:05:49.350> you

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
sketches okay so after doing that you

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.750 
sketches okay so after doing that you
can<00:05:50.250> quickly<00:05:51.020> separate<00:05:52.020> your<00:05:52.980> sketches<00:05:53.550> from

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
can quickly separate your sketches from

can quickly separate your sketches from
other<00:05:54.090> drawings<00:05:54.750> it<00:05:55.530> is<00:05:55.680> located<00:05:56.040> at<00:05:56.400> the

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
other drawings it is located at the

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.360 
other drawings it is located at the
bottom<00:05:56.760> of<00:05:57.090> the<00:05:57.180> layers<00:05:57.390> panel<00:05:57.840> it<00:05:58.530> is<00:05:58.590> awesome

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
bottom of the layers panel it is awesome

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.620 
bottom of the layers panel it is awesome
to<00:05:59.400> automatically<00:06:00.060> fill<00:06:00.480> it<00:06:00.630> in<00:06:00.840> or<00:06:01.500> change<00:06:02.310> it

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
to automatically fill it in or change it

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.640 
to automatically fill it in or change it
independently<00:06:03.630> in<00:06:03.750> the<00:06:03.870> middle<00:06:04.200> of<00:06:04.320> drawing

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
independently in the middle of drawing

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.570 
independently in the middle of drawing
and<00:06:05.270> the<00:06:06.270> last<00:06:06.480> one<00:06:06.720> is<00:06:06.930> set<00:06:07.380> in<00:06:07.530> menu<00:06:07.890> there

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
and the last one is set in menu there

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.760 
and the last one is set in menu there
are<00:06:08.760> a<00:06:08.820> lot<00:06:08.940> of<00:06:08.970> settings<00:06:09.360> port<00:06:09.930> flow<00:06:10.290> so<00:06:10.620> we

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
are a lot of settings port flow so we

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.040 
are a lot of settings port flow so we
will<00:06:10.920> probably<00:06:11.160> separate<00:06:12.000> it<00:06:12.210> in<00:06:12.390> separate

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
will probably separate it in separate

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:19.550 
will probably separate it in separate
