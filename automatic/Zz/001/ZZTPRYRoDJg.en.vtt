00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
leather we use leather got blue it takes

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.950 
leather we use leather got blue it takes
a<00:00:17.190> little<00:00:17.279> longer<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.699> do<00:00:17.940> but<00:00:18.180> on<00:00:18.690> some

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
a little longer to do but on some

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.099 
a little longer to do but on some
occasions<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.980> need<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.250> have<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:21.109> Philip

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
occasions you need to have a Philip

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.140 
occasions you need to have a Philip
that's<00:00:22.320> going<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.650> hold<00:00:23.220> up<00:00:23.519> under<00:00:23.789> the

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
that's going to hold up under the

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.589 
that's going to hold up under the
pressures<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.960> patent<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.590> sandstone

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
pressures of the patent of the sandstone

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.080 
pressures of the patent of the sandstone
so<00:00:27.599> one<00:00:28.380> if<00:00:28.800> you're<00:00:29.010> going<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.279> let<00:00:29.490> put<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.849> fill

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
so one if you're going to let put a fill

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.709 
so one if you're going to let put a fill
it<00:00:30.210> on<00:00:30.330> real<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.710> pattern<00:00:32.099> itself<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:33.420> really

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
it on real the pattern itself you really

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.540 
it on real the pattern itself you really
should<00:00:33.930> use<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.140> leather<00:00:34.680> filler<00:00:35.040> or<00:00:35.190> something

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
should use a leather filler or something

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.970 
should use a leather filler or something
that's<00:00:35.670> more<00:00:35.820> substantial<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.890> but<00:00:37.890> if

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
that's more substantial and but if

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.500 
that's more substantial and but if
you're<00:00:38.100> making<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.430> if<00:00:38.730> you're<00:00:39.210> going<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.390> make

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
you're making a if you're going to make

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.729 
you're making a if you're going to make
a<00:00:39.540> pattern<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.200> then<00:00:40.290> you're<00:00:40.410> going<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.559> use<00:00:40.710> a

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
a pattern and then you're going to use a

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.040 
a pattern and then you're going to use a
repro<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.190> wax<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.760> fine<00:00:42.000> because<00:00:42.210> once<00:00:42.840> you

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
repro the wax is fine because once you

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.069 
repro the wax is fine because once you
repro<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.820> make<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.149> mold<00:00:45.360> over<00:00:45.539> well

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
repro it and make the mold over well

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.340 
repro it and make the mold over well
then<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> Philip<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.340> permanently<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.120> there

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
then the Philip is permanently in there

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.709 
then the Philip is permanently in there
so<00:00:49.350> I'm<00:00:49.710> going<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.950> use<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.370> alcohol<00:00:51.300> lamp

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
so I'm going to use the alcohol lamp

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.180 
so I'm going to use the alcohol lamp
you've<00:00:51.930> got<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.199> heat<00:00:52.350> up<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.590> balls<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:53.070> or

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
you've got to heat up the balls in or

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.979 
you've got to heat up the balls in or
death<00:00:53.370> Hibbert<00:00:53.940> sized<00:00:54.180> balls<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.600> one<00:00:54.750> size

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
death Hibbert sized balls is one size

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.510 
death Hibbert sized balls is one size
here<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.350> other<00:00:55.500> side<00:00:55.710> have<00:00:55.890> smaller<00:00:56.250> ones

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
here the other side have smaller ones

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.849 
here the other side have smaller ones
larger<00:00:57.270> ones<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.690> they've<00:00:58.350> got<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.559> clean<00:00:58.710> it

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
larger ones and they've got to clean it

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.560 
larger ones and they've got to clean it
off<00:00:58.980> make<00:00:59.160> sure<00:00:59.190> there's<00:00:59.489> no<00:00:59.640> there's<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.449> lot

of paint on this one from trying to do

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.170 
of paint on this one from trying to do
it<00:01:04.439> over<00:01:04.710> over<00:01:05.040> top<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.430> painted<00:01:05.790> surface

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
it over over top of the painted surface

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.810 
it over over top of the painted surface
when<00:01:08.689> it<00:01:09.689> was<00:01:09.810> still<00:01:10.020> walled<00:01:10.400> you<00:01:11.400> heat<00:01:11.580> up<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
when it was still walled you heat up the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.440 
when it was still walled you heat up the
ball<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:12.990> larger<00:01:13.619> ball<00:01:14.150> you<00:01:15.150> can't

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
ball and on this larger ball you can't

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.390 
ball and on this larger ball you can't
run<00:01:16.080> into<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.350> much<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.009> got<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.250> keep

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.020 

it's<00:01:44.229> important<00:01:44.770> that<00:01:44.799> you<00:01:45.070> you<00:01:45.490> melt<00:01:45.760> the<00:01:45.820> wax

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
it's important that you you melt the wax

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.870 
it's important that you you melt the wax
in<00:01:46.330> so<00:01:46.540> it<00:01:46.630> sticks<00:01:47.520> especially<00:01:48.520> need<00:01:48.640> a<00:01:48.700> big

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
in so it sticks especially need a big

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.719 
in so it sticks especially need a big
phillips<00:01:49.270> they<00:01:49.420> got<00:01:49.570> them<00:01:50.159> got<00:01:51.159> to<00:01:51.250> be<00:01:51.340> melted

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
phillips they got them got to be melted

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:58.230 
phillips they got them got to be melted
in<00:01:51.960> wow<00:01:53.400> okay<00:01:56.369> just<00:01:57.369> right<00:01:57.640> it's<00:01:57.909> the<00:01:58.060> other

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
in wow okay just right it's the other

in wow okay just right it's the other
end<00:01:58.360> it's<00:01:58.659> like<00:01:58.720> burning<00:01:59.200> hot

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.150 

okay<00:02:05.180> and<00:02:05.810> you<00:02:05.930> basically<00:02:06.320> burnished<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.040> now

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
okay and you basically burnished it now

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.340 
okay and you basically burnished it now
when<00:02:07.280> you<00:02:07.370> get<00:02:07.490> to<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:07.670> corner<00:02:08.060> you<00:02:09.050> got<00:02:09.229> to

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
when you get to the corner you got to

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.780 
when you get to the corner you got to
heat<00:02:09.530> it<00:02:09.680> and<00:02:09.800> bend<00:02:10.009> it<00:02:10.130> around<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.460> corner<00:02:10.729> at

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
heat it and bend it around the corner at

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:17.830 
heat it and bend it around the corner at
the<00:02:10.880> same<00:02:11.090> time<00:02:16.270> now<00:02:17.270> you<00:02:17.360> want<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.630> large
