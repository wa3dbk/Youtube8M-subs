magnetic since it's on my fridge and
it's<00:00:33.030> just<00:00:33.180> it's<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:33.719> much<00:00:33.780> easier<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.320> get<00:00:34.410> it

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
it's just it's so much easier to get it

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.290 
it's just it's so much easier to get it
done<00:00:34.710> this<00:00:34.739> way<00:00:36.620> we<00:00:37.620> haven't<00:00:37.860> used<00:00:38.280> yet<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.760> it

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
done this way we haven't used yet and it

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.540 
done this way we haven't used yet and it
has<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.510> magnet<00:00:39.930> on<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.290> inside<00:00:41.070> if<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.460> can

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550

could<00:00:44.430> glue<00:00:44.579> onto<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.969> outside<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.300> just

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
could glue onto the outside I just

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.850 
could glue onto the outside I just
really<00:00:45.899> haven't<00:00:46.170> done<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.469> yet

Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
Saturday<00:00:59.609> Sunday<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.829> entire<00:01:02.250> thing

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309

actually<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.180> magnetic<00:01:03.930> as<00:01:04.110> well<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.470> if<00:01:04.530> you

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
actually is magnetic as well so if you

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.000 
actually is magnetic as well so if you
remove<00:01:04.920> these<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.659> one<00:01:07.110> sheet<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.740> that

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
remove these this is a one sheet of that

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
magnetic paper on the back so if you

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.770 
magnetic paper on the back so if you
want<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.310> move<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.790> other<00:01:11.970> places<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.630> your

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
fridge then it's very easy to do that

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.700 
fridge then it's very easy to do that
and<00:01:14.670> it's<00:01:15.150> also<00:01:15.299> very<00:01:15.540> lightweight<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.200> how<00:01:16.680> I

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
and it's also very lightweight so how I

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.039 
and it's also very lightweight so how I
will<00:01:17.040> go<00:01:17.189> about<00:01:17.400> menu<00:01:17.729> planning<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.270> taking

another<00:06:34.240> thing<00:06:34.510> that

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
another thing that

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.990 
another thing that
in<00:06:34.930> mention<00:06:35.350> was<00:06:35.650> I<00:06:36.010> try<00:06:36.220> to<00:06:36.280> plan<00:06:36.460> my<00:06:36.610> recipes

in mention was I try to plan my recipes
depending<00:06:37.360> on<00:06:37.420> the<00:06:37.510> ingredients<00:06:37.630> though

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
depending on the ingredients though

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.050 
depending on the ingredients though
there's<00:06:38.560> one<00:06:38.650> recipe<00:06:39.160> that<00:06:39.310> I<00:06:39.340> pick<00:06:39.640> and<00:06:39.880> it

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
there's one recipe that I pick and it

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.000 
there's one recipe that I pick and it
calls<00:06:40.240> for<00:06:40.300> a<00:06:40.450> half<00:06:40.600> an<00:06:40.750> onion<00:06:40.810> I<00:06:41.170> try<00:06:41.650> to<00:06:41.710> find

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010 
calls for a half an onion I try to find

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.650 
calls for a half an onion I try to find
another<00:06:42.280> recipe<00:06:42.580> that<00:06:42.820> also<00:06:42.970> calls<00:06:43.300> for<00:06:43.390> half

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:43.660 
another recipe that also calls for half

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.510 
another recipe that also calls for half
an<00:06:43.810> onion<00:06:43.900> because<00:06:44.320> as<00:06:44.920> the<00:06:45.010> other<00:06:45.130> half<00:06:45.370> of

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 
an onion because as the other half of

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.920 
an onion because as the other half of
that<00:06:45.610> onion<00:06:45.760> is<00:06:46.000> going<00:06:46.120> to<00:06:46.210> go<00:06:46.300> to<00:06:46.360> waste<00:06:46.540> and

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:46.930 
that onion is going to go to waste and

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.500 
that onion is going to go to waste and
onions<00:06:47.920> typically<00:06:48.490> aren't<00:06:48.790> used<00:06:48.970> for<00:06:49.240> snack

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:49.510 
onions typically aren't used for snack

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.000 
onions typically aren't used for snack
so<00:06:49.750> you<00:06:49.840> can't<00:06:50.020> just<00:06:50.200> get<00:06:50.290> rid<00:06:50.440> of<00:06:50.530> it<00:06:50.680> that<00:06:50.710> way

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.010 
so you can't just get rid of it that way

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.740 
so you can't just get rid of it that way
anyways<00:06:51.430> I'll<00:06:51.610> be<00:06:51.730> linking<00:06:52.060> to<00:06:52.120> everything
