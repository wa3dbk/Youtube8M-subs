now<00:01:42.540> practically<00:01:43.530> thinking<00:01:43.890> Jimmy<00:01:44.130> if<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
now practically thinking Jimmy if the

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.499 
now practically thinking Jimmy if the
ref<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.759> actually<00:01:45.030> there<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.240> he<00:01:45.329> sees

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509

ref is actually there and he sees
something<00:01:45.840> racist<00:01:46.020> would<00:01:46.439> he<00:01:46.500> actually<00:01:46.740> have

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
something racist would he actually have

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.280 
something racist would he actually have
the<00:01:46.979> stones<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.640> stop<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> game<00:01:48.119> completely<00:01:48.689> no

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
the stones to stop a game completely no

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.020 
the stones to stop a game completely no
I<00:01:49.320> mean<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.799> think<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.040> has<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.189> be<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:50.640> blatantly

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
I mean I think it has to be so blatantly

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.760 
I mean I think it has to be so blatantly
obvious<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.630> he<00:01:51.689> had<00:01:51.840> no<00:01:52.079> other<00:01:52.259> choice

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
obvious that he had no other choice

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.139 
obvious that he had no other choice
so<00:01:52.890> like<00:01:53.130> something<00:01:53.430> being<00:01:53.579> thrown<00:01:53.790> on<00:01:53.850> the

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
so like something being thrown on the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.330 
so like something being thrown on the
field<00:01:54.329> or<00:01:54.960> at<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.079> particular<00:01:55.229> player<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:56.130> think

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
field or at a particular player I think

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.859 
field or at a particular player I think
that<00:01:56.700> could<00:01:56.909> give<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> reason<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.570> justify

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
that could give a reason to justify

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.359 
that could give a reason to justify
saying<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.530> no<00:01:58.649> more<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.979> game's<00:01:59.130> gonna<00:01:59.250> be
