it's not even glass you know glass

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.260 
it's not even glass you know glass
blocks<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:02.650> know<00:03:02.830> the<00:03:03.370> come<00:03:03.640> from<00:03:03.850> San<00:03:04.090> you

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
blocks you know the come from San you

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.220 
blocks you know the come from San you
can<00:03:04.420> even<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:05.850> make<00:03:06.850> it<00:03:06.970> by<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.150> 61<00:03:07.810> you<00:03:08.080> know

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
can even and make it by the 61 you know

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.500 
can even and make it by the 61 you know
and<00:03:08.500> then<00:03:08.710> get<00:03:09.220> it<00:03:09.370> 12<00:03:09.790> of<00:03:09.970> them<00:03:10.150> so<00:03:10.330> it's

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
and then get it 12 of them so it's

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.780 
and then get it 12 of them so it's
really<00:03:10.900> really<00:03:11.380> T<00:03:11.590> but<00:03:11.710> it<00:03:11.860> does<00:03:12.040> five<00:03:12.400> protect

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
really really T but it does five protect

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.660 
really really T but it does five protect
them<00:03:12.940> soon<00:03:13.180> as<00:03:13.330> I<00:03:13.360> say<00:03:13.890> insanely<00:03:14.890> cheap<00:03:15.070> sort

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
you just need to start off by a basic

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.570 
you just need to start off by a basic
really<00:03:23.710> good<00:03:23.920> software<00:03:24.540> for<00:03:25.540> cheap<00:03:25.780> price<00:03:26.050> so

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
really good software for cheap price so

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.060 
really good software for cheap price so
yeah<00:03:27.580> it's<00:03:28.330> really<00:03:28.600> cool<00:03:28.690> the<00:03:29.380> next<00:03:29.680> so<00:03:29.770> here

yeah it's really cool the next so here

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.360 
yeah it's really cool the next so here
is<00:03:30.250> a<00:03:30.930> little<00:03:31.930> bit<00:03:32.170> of<00:03:32.260> a<00:03:32.350> rough<00:03:32.590> recipe<00:03:33.130> a

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
is a little bit of a rough recipe a

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.400 
is a little bit of a rough recipe a
class<00:03:33.820> a<00:03:34.090> lot<00:03:34.420> of<00:03:34.540> iron<00:03:34.870> but<00:03:35.050> you<00:03:35.140> know<00:03:35.260> when

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
class a lot of iron but you know when

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.770 
class a lot of iron but you know when
you<00:03:35.470> get<00:03:35.620> into<00:03:35.860> your<00:03:35.980> service<00:03:36.520> and<00:03:36.730> playing<00:03:37.690> a

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
you get into your service and playing a

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.650 
you get into your service and playing a
lot<00:03:37.960> you<00:03:38.380> will<00:03:38.410> have<00:03:38.860> a<00:03:38.890> lot<00:03:39.190> of<00:03:39.220> family<00:03:39.730> time<00:03:40.360> I

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
lot you will have a lot of family time I

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.420 
lot you will have a lot of family time I
am<00:03:40.990> and<00:03:41.230> you<00:03:41.380> don't<00:03:41.530> know<00:03:41.710> what<00:03:41.830> to<00:03:41.950> do<00:03:42.130> with<00:03:42.280> it

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
am and you don't know what to do with it

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.050 
am and you don't know what to do with it
so<00:03:42.750> this<00:03:43.750> is<00:03:44.050> the<00:03:44.470> infinity<00:03:45.190> sword<00:03:45.400> seven

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
so this is the infinity sword seven

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.710 
so this is the infinity sword seven
attack<00:03:46.360> damage<00:03:46.540> it<00:03:46.900> is<00:03:47.110> pretty<00:03:47.650> good<00:03:48.010> I<00:03:48.510> am<00:03:49.510> and

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
attack damage it is pretty good I am and

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.860 
attack damage it is pretty good I am and
it<00:03:49.810> is<00:03:49.960> made<00:03:50.140> by<00:03:50.290> two-time<00:03:50.830> iron<00:03:51.190> blocks

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
it is made by two-time iron blocks

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.370 
it is made by two-time iron blocks
servicing<00:03:52.870> diamonds<00:03:53.320> and<00:03:53.800> for<00:03:54.510> iron<00:03:55.510> there<00:03:56.260> we

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
servicing diamonds and for iron there we

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.980 
servicing diamonds and for iron there we
go<00:03:56.530> ingots<00:03:57.070> and<00:03:57.190> one<00:03:57.730> stick<00:03:58.150> at<00:03:58.300> the<00:03:58.390> bottom<00:03:58.750> so

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
go ingots and one stick at the bottom so

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.370 
go ingots and one stick at the bottom so
it<00:03:59.020> is<00:03:59.610> well<00:04:00.610> I<00:04:00.640> wouldn't<00:04:00.970> say<00:04:01.060> it's<00:04:01.420> it's<00:04:02.290> a

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
it is well I wouldn't say it's it's a

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.560 
it is well I wouldn't say it's it's a
pretty<00:04:02.590> cool<00:04:02.800> recipe<00:04:03.220> but<00:04:03.370> it's<00:04:03.700> a<00:04:03.820> little<00:04:04.060> as

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
pretty cool recipe but it's a little as

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.260 
pretty cool recipe but it's a little as
a<00:04:04.840> little<00:04:05.140> rough<00:04:05.380> if<00:04:05.770> you<00:04:06.100> like<00:04:06.430> starter<00:04:06.940> so

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
a little rough if you like starter so

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.910 
a little rough if you like starter so
you're<00:04:07.930> probably<00:04:08.080> going<00:04:08.380> to<00:04:08.470> wait<00:04:08.650> till<00:04:08.830> you

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
you're probably going to wait till you

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.680 
you're probably going to wait till you
get<00:04:09.100> like<00:04:09.310> a<00:04:09.580> good<00:04:09.850> amount<00:04:10.060> of<00:04:10.180> episodes<00:04:10.600> in

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
get like a good amount of episodes in

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.530 
get like a good amount of episodes in
and<00:04:10.840> done<00:04:11.260> a<00:04:11.290> lot<00:04:11.500> of<00:04:11.530> mining<00:04:12.060> but<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.240> next

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
and done a lot of mining but the next

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.420 
and done a lot of mining but the next
salt<00:04:13.720> we<00:04:13.840> have<00:04:13.990> a<00:04:14.200> tail<00:04:14.410> episode<00:04:14.620> and<00:04:15.160> it<00:04:15.280> is

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
salt we have a tail episode and it is

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.789 
salt we have a tail episode and it is
made<00:04:15.640> by<00:04:15.820> a<00:04:15.850> stick<00:04:16.359> and<00:04:16.570> two<00:04:16.810> lattice<00:04:17.410> blocks

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
made by a stick and two lattice blocks

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.150 
made by a stick and two lattice blocks
which<00:04:18.790> is<00:04:19.060> well<00:04:19.930> okay<00:04:20.350> but<00:04:20.500> it's<00:04:20.680> only<00:04:20.859> does

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
which is well okay but it's only does

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.390 
which is well okay but it's only does
for<00:04:21.520> tech<00:04:21.880> damage<00:04:22.270> so<00:04:23.100> it's<00:04:24.100> not<00:04:24.340> really

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
for tech damage so it's not really

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.390 
for tech damage so it's not really
