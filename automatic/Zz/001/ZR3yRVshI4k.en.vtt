00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.749

the<00:04:42.169> Bennett's<00:04:42.560> go<00:04:42.770> there<00:04:42.979> Elizabeth<00:04:43.520> talks

the Bennett's go there Elizabeth talks

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:46.450

about<00:04:44.060> how<00:04:44.300> the<00:04:44.360> house<00:04:44.690> doesn't<00:04:45.560> impose<00:04:46.130> on

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
about how the house doesn't impose on

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.580 
about how the house doesn't impose on
nature<00:04:46.910> but<00:04:47.120> nature<00:04:47.150> sort<00:04:47.870> of<00:04:47.960> complements

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
nature but nature sort of complements

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:49.960 
nature but nature sort of complements
the<00:04:48.740> ice<00:04:48.830> and<00:04:49.100> the<00:04:49.190> highest<00:04:49.430> compliments

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
the ice and the highest compliments

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.550 
the ice and the highest compliments
nature<00:04:50.330> because<00:04:50.539> it's<00:04:50.690> positioned<00:04:51.199> like<00:04:51.349> in

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
nature because it's positioned like in

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.110 
nature because it's positioned like in
front<00:04:51.800> of<00:04:51.889> the<00:04:51.979> woods<00:04:52.220> and<00:04:52.460> I<00:04:52.729> think<00:04:52.940> that's

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
front of the woods and I think that's

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.120 
front of the woods and I think that's
really<00:04:53.539> beautiful<00:04:53.990> idea<00:04:54.590> and<00:04:54.830> it's<00:04:54.949> something

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
really beautiful idea and it's something

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.029 
really beautiful idea and it's something
that<00:04:55.340> when<00:04:56.060> you're<00:04:56.210> building<00:04:56.570> a<00:04:56.990> house<00:04:57.680> or

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
that when you're building a house or

00:04:58.039 --> 00:04:59.740 
that when you're building a house or
anything<00:04:58.430> that<00:04:58.789> you<00:04:58.910> should<00:04:59.090> sort<00:04:59.300> of<00:04:59.449> think

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
anything that you should sort of think

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.450 
anything that you should sort of think
about<00:04:59.930> that<00:05:00.320> it<00:05:00.470> should<00:05:00.650> fit<00:05:00.830> with<00:05:01.039> nature

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
about that it should fit with nature

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.460 
about that it should fit with nature
instead<00:05:01.759> of<00:05:01.940> destroying<00:05:02.599> it<00:05:02.840> or<00:05:02.990> changing<00:05:03.349> it

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
instead of destroying it or changing it

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.260 
instead of destroying it or changing it
so<00:05:03.620> I<00:05:03.860> just<00:05:03.979> really<00:05:04.340> like<00:05:04.490> that<00:05:04.639> description

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
so I just really like that description

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.730 
so I just really like that description
and<00:05:05.479> obviously<00:05:05.810> there's<00:05:06.020> movie<00:05:06.320> versions

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
and obviously there's movie versions

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.710 
and obviously there's movie versions
