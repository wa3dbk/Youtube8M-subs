being Thiago Silva Vincent Kompany and

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.730 
being Thiago Silva Vincent Kompany and
also<00:01:26.220> surgeon<00:01:26.820> runoffs<00:01:27.630> if<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.140> want<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.500> pace

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740

Thiago silver that you turned towards

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.590 
Thiago silver that you turned towards

because they are the pace year of the
free<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.140> but<00:01:34.740> Vincent<00:01:35.040> Kompany<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.520> no

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640
