 orientation the goal develop a real cohesion between the players 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.179
 of hubert it was 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.539
 and for that it took at least ten kilometers a difference in altitude 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.539
 350 meters the six tags of the discussions 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.210
 that's why it's okay 

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:28.189
 to deal with other more relevant candidates the fact that some 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.220
 points explain why 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.650
 we're going to be an internship going on again 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.320
 five years ago a day and a half 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.910
 we see things 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.910
 2 put them in situation release for whom to speak 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.230
 to know each other 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.290
 we try to do different things a little bit and 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.690
 challenges 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.600
 a team competition 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.690
 so we will probably not see the truth remains to the truth of the ground 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.810
 is and the beginning of the championship between 14 and we really need 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.050
 since then started according to rumors announced fire 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.510
 the first two home defeats 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.270
 you had to endure immediately seduced 2 points in the end it's on my 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.430
 start of season for humanitarian affairs 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.360
 at the end of the season 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.000
 contemporary dance classes 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 the next day against the ghosts to take care of them 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.320
 it was necessary to observe 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.620
 frankly no we knew nine 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.790
 the attacker of the om 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.140
 the world he reminded why he acknowledged the facts 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.680
 this is really the case 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.660
 earlier 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.210
 the vuelta 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.680
 why the 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.829
 the future entrepreneurs of minus the record of the longest 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.390
 I feel at home more 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.560

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.290
 in the field it still remains why bernard and catch up with the 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.460
 problem is elsewhere that's it's done to facilitate easy access 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.290

 failed to dwell on the strategies employed to win the 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.349
