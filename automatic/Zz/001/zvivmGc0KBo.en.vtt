00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.309 
his work when I was teaching at the
University<00:02:27.860> darussalam<00:02:28.269> and<00:02:29.269> I<00:02:29.840> was<00:02:30.019> struck

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
University darussalam and I was struck

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.430 
University darussalam and I was struck
by<00:02:30.350> how<00:02:30.620> vivid<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:32.209> characters<00:02:32.750> were<00:02:32.900> just

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
by how vivid the characters were just

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.080 
by how vivid the characters were just
really<00:02:33.590> drew<00:02:33.950> me<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:35.750> his<00:02:35.959> work<00:02:36.400> I<00:02:37.400> like<00:02:37.940> his

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
really drew me to his work I like his

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.550 
really drew me to his work I like his
animal<00:02:38.510> work<00:02:38.630> a<00:02:38.750> great<00:02:38.930> deal<00:02:39.080> because<00:02:39.290> of<00:02:39.440> the

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
animal work a great deal because of the

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.780 
animal work a great deal because of the
vivid<00:02:39.800> colors<00:02:40.069> which<00:02:40.220> i<00:02:40.310> think<00:02:40.370> is<00:02:40.580> very

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
vivid colors which i think is very

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.449 
vivid colors which i think is very
typical<00:02:41.360> of<00:02:41.750> africa<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.410> reminds<00:02:43.310> me<00:02:43.430> very

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
typical of africa and reminds me very

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.479 
typical of africa and reminds me very
much<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.850> Equatorial<00:02:44.780> Africa<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.860> vibrancy

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
much of Equatorial Africa the vibrancy

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.270 
much of Equatorial Africa the vibrancy
and<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:47.209> warmth<00:02:47.570> of<00:02:47.720> Africa<00:02:48.230> I<00:02:48.440> think<00:02:49.220> he

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
and the warmth of Africa I think he

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.009 
and the warmth of Africa I think he
captures<00:02:49.700> that<00:02:49.730> he<00:02:50.090> kind<00:02:50.420> of<00:02:50.450> embodies<00:02:50.989> that

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
captures that he kind of embodies that

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.890 
captures that he kind of embodies that
it's<00:02:51.739> very<00:02:51.799> much<00:02:52.010> folk<00:02:52.489> art<00:02:52.760> at<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.450> same<00:02:53.660> time

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
it's very much folk art at the same time

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.699 
it's very much folk art at the same time
it's<00:02:54.590> something<00:02:54.980> very<00:02:55.720> contemporary<00:02:56.720> which<00:02:57.110> I

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
it's something very contemporary which I

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.560 
it's something very contemporary which I
think<00:02:58.220> he<00:02:58.310> kind<00:02:58.489> of<00:02:58.549> crossed<00:02:58.850> that<00:02:59.180> makes<00:02:59.480> it

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
think he kind of crossed that makes it

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.110 
think he kind of crossed that makes it
very<00:02:59.690> appealing<00:03:00.110> both<00:03:00.950> to<00:03:01.190> Africans<00:03:01.670> and<00:03:01.850> to

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
very appealing both to Africans and to

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.440 
very appealing both to Africans and to
the<00:03:02.630> Western<00:03:03.200> I<00:03:03.790> but<00:03:04.790> what<00:03:04.940> strikes<00:03:05.209> me<00:03:05.420> the

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
the Western I but what strikes me the

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.710 
the Western I but what strikes me the
most<00:03:05.570> of<00:03:05.810> us<00:03:05.900> work<00:03:06.140> is<00:03:06.320> his<00:03:07.060> political<00:03:08.060> and

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
most of us work is his political and

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.140 
most of us work is his political and
social<00:03:09.230> and<00:03:09.470> cultural<00:03:09.650> commentary<00:03:10.459> work

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
social and cultural commentary work

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.150 
social and cultural commentary work
rather<00:03:11.900> than<00:03:12.049> his<00:03:12.230> animal<00:03:12.620> work<00:03:12.769> and<00:03:13.010> then

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
rather than his animal work and then

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.650 
rather than his animal work and then
that<00:03:13.340> I<00:03:13.370> find<00:03:13.880> he<00:03:14.720> is<00:03:15.049> very<00:03:16.040> much<00:03:16.970> an<00:03:17.120> advocate

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
that I find he is very much an advocate

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.960 
that I find he is very much an advocate
to<00:03:17.840> very<00:03:18.019> much<00:03:18.880> a<00:03:20.890> motivator<00:03:21.890> of<00:03:22.010> change<00:03:22.519> and

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
to very much a motivator of change and

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.780 
to very much a motivator of change and
part<00:03:23.299> of<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.510> change<00:03:23.780> which<00:03:24.109> is<00:03:24.290> occurring<00:03:24.790> in

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
part of the change which is occurring in

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.060 
part of the change which is occurring in
Africa<00:03:26.359> and<00:03:26.630> Tanzania<00:03:26.829> specifically<00:03:27.829> and

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
Africa and Tanzania specifically and

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.640 
Africa and Tanzania specifically and
that<00:03:29.000> is<00:03:29.209> remarkable<00:03:29.720> and<00:03:29.989> that's<00:03:30.320> why<00:03:30.620> I

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
that is remarkable and that's why I

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.569 
that is remarkable and that's why I
think<00:03:30.950> his<00:03:31.070> book<00:03:31.310> is<00:03:31.459> very<00:03:31.489> important<00:03:33.100> for<00:03:34.100> not

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
think his book is very important for not

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.120 
think his book is very important for not
only<00:03:34.609> for<00:03:35.000> tanzanians<00:03:35.570> but<00:03:35.840> also<00:03:35.959> for<00:03:36.410> for

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
only for tanzanians but also for for

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.520 
only for tanzanians but also for for
others<00:03:37.459> understand<00:03:38.030> tanzania<00:03:38.720> and<00:03:38.930> what

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
others understand tanzania and what

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.840 
others understand tanzania and what
africa's<00:03:39.890> going<00:03:40.070> through<00:03:40.310> so<00:03:40.459> it's<00:03:40.579> kind<00:03:40.730> of<00:03:40.760> a

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
africa's going through so it's kind of a

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.819 
africa's going through so it's kind of a
documentary<00:03:41.150> or<00:03:42.130> a<00:03:43.959> way<00:03:44.959> of<00:03:44.989> marking<00:03:45.590> the

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
documentary or a way of marking the
