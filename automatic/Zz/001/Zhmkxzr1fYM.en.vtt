 well tom coynÃ© is the one who has guided the 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:08.980
 strategy from the beginning of the xbox 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.800
 10 years ago and more recently 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.979
 since he served as general manager of 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.170
 design and entertainment in microsoft and 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:20.470
 has informed that it will adopt a role 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:24.910
 different in the company to change the 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:27.659
 personal and enma williams to emma williams 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.729
 is the one in charge 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.299
 from which they came at the launch of the 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.609
 new xbox 360 dashboard and how 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.119
 general manager of experiences on xbox 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:42.359
 has already apparently assumed the old 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.649
 coÃ­n 2 post now she is the 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:44.880
 general manager of the design and 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.200
 entertainment 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.929
 Microsoft has refused to comment 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.609
 about a possible successor to xbox 360 or 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.399
 about personnel changes has 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:57.959
 rejected, but the firm has spoken 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.810
 many times about his plans for a 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:04.530
 life cycle for the 10-year console 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.539
 which was launched at the end of 2005 and although 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.550
 that rules out that the successor is released 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:11.230
 during that period 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:16.390
 it is said that the first announcement of 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:21.490
 Microsoft talking about the xbox 720 will be in 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.470
 the cs of january 2012 you read the 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.560
 news is worth it has given me time to 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:31.150
 memorize ore but good we go over a 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:35.799
 a little staff within 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.230
 microsoft says I have notion already sure 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:41.620
 safe in 2013 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.319
 and the xbox 720 will come out I imagine that 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.100
 will be pulling and by the end of 2013 because 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:51.490
 If you are going to take me out 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:57.710

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:59.990
 then there's the e3 promotions improvements and 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.400
 will come out I imagine that the first 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.310
 Then, after the place de gentes 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.110
 trying two and now there is a doubt 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.880
 latent that everyone has in mind 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:12.910
 that as for people who have the 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.280
 playstation3 wants to move to xbox 360 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.890
 I get many messages asking me 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.000

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.350

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.020
 through the debate and through you 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.220
 Opinions I would like to comment if 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.170
 that carries six those people who 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.310
 they have doubts because under my weight under my 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.550
 opinion yo 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.410
 It could not be a year without a console but 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.200
 good if it's going to leave 2013 is no longer 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.989
 nothing to have it I would recommend you 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.459
 to all those people who have 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.739
 playstation I would recommend that you 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.569
 stay in the moment with the playstation 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.269
 to play with the games that have 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.190
 gone out so far and that as for 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.830
 get out in the xbox then good to be able to 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.989
 acquire it I think I do not have anything else 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.790
 What to say please mixer and what 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.099

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.640
 xbox 360 should be expected should 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.940
 buy it 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.490

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.240
