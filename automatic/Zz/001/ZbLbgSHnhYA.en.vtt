00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:07.540
 the cream side with sparks 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:10.559
 chocolate ingredients 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.960
 implements to use 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:17.290
 we will start preparing the gelatin 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.750
 we deposit the gelatin and add 100 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:23.320
 milliliters of hot water which 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.930
 Equivalent to half a cup 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.260
 then we stir until it dissolves 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.710
 we completely let cool and 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.710
 we reserve 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.070
 It is important that from night 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.920
 previous 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.370
 Refrigerate products and implements 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:49.060
 that are shown in this way the smoothie 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.010
 of the cream will take more volume 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.519
 i 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.120
 to beat, we deposit in a bowl the 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:00.780
 three boxes of cream 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.710
 we beat at high speed until we reach 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.250
 volume to me it took me about 10 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.250
 minutes 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.890
 we add the cold milk and we beat 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:35.719
 we deposit the cold evaporated milk and 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.719
 we continue beating 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.369
 we add the sugar and we keep beating 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:57.960
 we incorporate the gelatin also cold 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.960
 and we continue with the shake 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.100
 add the vanilla and beat 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:27.610
 concluded the smoothie covered with a 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.610
 plastic sheet and we take to the freezer 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.950
 We kept the mixture in the freezer 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:42.200
 until it was semi-solid to me I take 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.950
 approximately 6 hours 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:50.769
 now we will beat with a single yellow 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.769
 until it is creamy but not liquid 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.000
 when the ice cream is creamy 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 we reserve 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:20.110
 we prepare the chocolate we will split the 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.110
 bars in pieces 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:30.320
 and we add 50 milliliters of cold water 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.320
 what is equivalent to a quarter cup 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.080
 We take the microwave for 2 minutes 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.800
 stir until the chocolate is 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.800
 dissolved 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.810
 we are depositing the chocolate little by little 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.739
 and beating 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.739
 Y 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:22.680
 we have concluded now you go and we will do the 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:22.680
 mixing in plastic containers 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:40.789
 We take to the freezer until it is 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:40.789
 solid I kept it for 24 hours 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:49.240
 after the time we removed the 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.240
 freezer to start serving 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:57.550
 with this recipe we got 3 liters of 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:00.990
 ice cream although it seems a lot the truth is 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.990
 that lasted very little 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:11.289
 the ice cream or ice cream and its dessert 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:15.030
 frozen made of water milk cream 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:20.919
 milk or custard combined with 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:23.740
 flavoring sweeteners or sugar in the 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:27.870
 other ingredients are added 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:33.220
 such as egg yolk fruits 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:36.909
 chocolate cookies nuts yogurt and 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:39.879
 Stabilizing substances the term 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:42.729
 ice cream is reserved for 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:46.509
 those ice creams made with a high 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:50.099
 percentage of milk fat can be 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:53.919
 highlight three industrial ice cream types 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:57.030
 who use specialized machinery and 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:59.919
 they include artificial colorants 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:03.120
 flavorings and stabilizers for 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:06.250
 enhance its ice-cream look and taste 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.500
 crafts that are made with 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.510
 manual procedures 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:15.520
 its preparation uses only 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:19.420
 fresh soft ice cream products that 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:22.690
 used in waffles or cones is served 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:26.490
 operating the tap of a machine are 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:29.830
 very light and very soft texture 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:33.480
 generally cheaper because no 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.480
 they require freezing 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.870
