00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
according to us it's a series of

according to us it's a series of
repeating<00:00:42.270> top<00:00:42.540> two<00:00:42.750> tops<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.230> any<00:00:43.410> data

back<00:00:47.190> as<00:00:47.460> long<00:00:47.969> as<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.390> been<00:00:48.600> traded<00:00:49.110> we

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
back as long as it's been traded we

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.350 
back as long as it's been traded we
found<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.920> top<00:00:50.129> for<00:00:50.460> instance<00:00:50.879> every<00:00:51.059> eight

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
found the top for instance every eight

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.049 
found the top for instance every eight
weeks<00:00:51.390> every<00:00:51.989> 17<00:00:52.559> weeks<00:00:52.800> every<00:00:53.219> 39<00:00:53.789> weeks

every<00:00:54.510> sixty<00:00:54.930> five<00:00:55.170> weeks<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:56.129> looks<00:00:56.309> like

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
every sixty five weeks and it looks like

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.920 
every sixty five weeks and it looks like
sine<00:00:56.789> curves<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.390> when<00:00:57.539> they<00:00:57.629> were<00:00:57.690> all

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
sine curves and when they were all

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.560 
sine curves and when they were all
topping<00:00:58.559> going<00:00:59.550> back<00:00:59.789> with<00:01:00.180> getting<00:01:00.390> a

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
topping going back with getting a

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.779 
topping going back with getting a
predictive<00:01:01.109> posture<00:01:01.590> from<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.949> past<00:01:02.219> that's

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
predictive posture from the past that's

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.420 
predictive posture from the past that's
what<00:01:03.030> showed<00:01:03.270> us<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.660> was<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.870> top<00:01:04.290> we<00:01:05.220> have<00:01:05.400> a

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
what showed us it was a top we have a

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.120 
what showed us it was a top we have a
target<00:01:05.820> algorithm<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:06.960> addition<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.950> that

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
target algorithm in addition to that

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.850 
target algorithm in addition to that
which<00:01:08.340> showed<00:01:08.580> 1900<00:01:09.390> was<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.780> level<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.680> was

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
which showed 1900 was the level that was

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.070 
which showed 1900 was the level that was
the<00:01:11.010> time<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.369> get<00:01:11.549> out<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.000> obviously<00:01:12.450> those

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
the time to get out and obviously those

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.580 
the time to get out and obviously those
who<00:01:13.260> listen<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.590> us<00:01:13.799> are<00:01:13.950> very<00:01:14.130> happy<00:01:15.200> now<00:01:16.200> as

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
who listen to us are very happy now as

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.460 
who listen to us are very happy now as
we<00:01:17.040> were<00:01:17.189> talking<00:01:17.580> before<00:01:17.720> wed<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.990> do<00:01:19.200> in

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
we were talking before wed to do in

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.499 
we were talking before wed to do in
terms<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.070> being<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.430> bottoming<00:01:20.970> process

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
terms of it being a bottoming process

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.170 
terms of it being a bottoming process
we're<00:01:21.810> very<00:01:22.110> close<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> bottom<00:01:23.220> longer-term

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
we're very close to a bottom longer-term

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.999 
we're very close to a bottom longer-term
we<00:01:24.630> think<00:01:24.869> it's<00:01:25.020> going<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.229> go<00:01:25.320> back<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.860> where

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
we think it's going to go back to where

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.890 
we think it's going to go back to where
it<00:01:26.040> was<00:01:26.159> at<00:01:26.670> its<00:01:26.850> highs<00:01:27.030> which<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.570> kind<00:01:27.810> of

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
it was at its highs which is kind of

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.870 
it was at its highs which is kind of
hard<00:01:28.049> for<00:01:28.229> people<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.530> imagine<00:01:29.040> now<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:29.700> been

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
hard for people to imagine now it's been

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.030 
hard for people to imagine now it's been
down<00:01:30.060> for<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.420> long<00:01:30.630> but<00:01:31.350> we're<00:01:31.530> just<00:01:31.560> we're

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
down for so long but we're just we're

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.940 
down for so long but we're just we're
standing<00:01:32.460> aside<00:01:32.759> now<00:01:33.150> because<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.990> target

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
standing aside now because the target

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.640 
standing aside now because the target
piece<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.460> our<00:01:35.810> algorithm<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:36.960> not<00:01:37.140> giving<00:01:37.530> us

very close to it but we're not there yet

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.450 
very close to it but we're not there yet
so<00:01:42.180> when<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.570> say<00:01:42.810> we're<00:01:43.049> bottoming<00:01:43.770> David

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
so when you say we're bottoming David

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.030 
so when you say we're bottoming David
where<00:01:44.820> do<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.060> see<00:01:45.360> us<00:01:45.390> headed<00:01:45.810> lower<00:01:46.020> um<00:01:46.799> it

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
where do you see us headed lower um it

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.760 
where do you see us headed lower um it
could<00:01:47.310> be<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.520> little<00:01:47.850> lower<00:01:48.180> yes<00:01:48.930> but<00:01:49.350> it's<00:01:49.500> not

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
could be a little lower yes but it's not

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.100 
could be a little lower yes but it's not
like<00:01:50.040> it's<00:01:50.310> gonna<00:01:50.490> fall<00:01:50.579> off<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.299> go<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.479> 800

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
like it's gonna fall off and go to 800

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.899 
like it's gonna fall off and go to 800
is<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.320> lot<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.710> technical<00:01:53.070> people<00:01:53.520> think<00:01:53.729> it's

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
is a lot of technical people think it's

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.510 
is a lot of technical people think it's
got<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.229> 1100<00:01:55.229> resistance<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:56.009> thousand

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
got a 1100 resistance a thousand

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.120 
got a 1100 resistance a thousand
resistance<00:01:57.119> we<00:01:57.780> think<00:01:58.079> we<00:01:58.320> do<00:01:58.500> not<00:01:58.680> we<00:01:58.920> are<00:01:58.950> not

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
resistance we think we do not we are not

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.420 
resistance we think we do not we are not
negative<00:01:59.820> I<00:02:00.030> did<00:02:01.020> mention<00:02:01.259> before<00:02:01.560> there's<00:02:02.340> a

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
negative I did mention before there's a

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.550 
negative I did mention before there's a
major<00:02:02.729> show<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.390> wanted<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.810> have<00:02:04.079> Charles

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
major show that wanted to have Charles

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.139 
major show that wanted to have Charles
on<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:05.159> morning<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.729> they<00:02:05.820> were<00:02:05.880> looking

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
on this morning and they were looking

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.719 
on this morning and they were looking
for<00:02:06.360> someone<00:02:06.899> negative<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.680> he<00:02:08.340> said<00:02:08.550> I'm<00:02:08.700> not

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
for someone negative and he said I'm not

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.279 
for someone negative and he said I'm not
negative<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.479> they<00:02:09.539> wouldn't<00:02:09.869> put<00:02:09.989> him<00:02:10.110> on

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
negative and they wouldn't put him on

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.990 
negative and they wouldn't put him on
Charles<00:02:10.890> said<00:02:11.039> I'm<00:02:11.160> honest<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.819> tell<00:02:12.390> you

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
Charles said I'm honest I tell you

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.450 
Charles said I'm honest I tell you
see<00:02:13.150> so<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.990> answer<00:02:14.260> is<00:02:14.290> those<00:02:14.950> who<00:02:15.160> were<00:02:15.280> in

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
see so the answer is those who were in

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.650 
see so the answer is those who were in
gold<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:16.030> in<00:02:16.180> pain<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:16.750> silver<00:02:17.260> um<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:19.210> the

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
gold and in pain and silver um the the

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.570 
gold and in pain and silver um the the
future<00:02:20.020> is<00:02:20.080> bright<00:02:20.380> but<00:02:20.650> we're<00:02:21.160> not<00:02:21.340> quite

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
future is bright but we're not quite

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.370 
future is bright but we're not quite
there<00:02:21.610> yet<00:02:21.850> so<00:02:22.450> when<00:02:22.600> you<00:02:22.690> say<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.960> future<00:02:23.170> is

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
there yet so when you say the future is

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.200 
there yet so when you say the future is
bright<00:02:23.770> David<00:02:24.160> are<00:02:24.250> you<00:02:24.310> talking<00:02:24.730> two<00:02:24.940> years

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
bright David are you talking two years

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.660 
bright David are you talking two years
three<00:02:25.480> years<00:02:25.540> five<00:02:26.050> years<00:02:26.110> yeah<00:02:26.890> yeah<00:02:27.310> I<00:02:27.550> mean

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
three years five years yeah yeah I mean

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.190 
three years five years yeah yeah I mean
I<00:02:27.850> don't<00:02:27.880> think<00:02:28.210> it's<00:02:28.330> gonna<00:02:28.480> take<00:02:28.570> five<00:02:28.960> years

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
I don't think it's gonna take five years

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.470 
I don't think it's gonna take five years
for<00:02:29.350> it<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.709> reach<00:02:30.130> back<00:02:30.400> up<00:02:30.610> but<00:02:30.820> it's<00:02:31.209> going

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
for it to reach back up but it's going

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.350 
for it to reach back up but it's going
to<00:02:31.570> start<00:02:31.870> its<00:02:32.080> way<00:02:32.440> up<00:02:32.709> soon<00:02:33.130> there's<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:34.000> short

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
to start its way up soon there's a short

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.340 
to start its way up soon there's a short
term<00:02:34.600> top<00:02:34.990> around<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.800> middle<00:02:36.100> of<00:02:36.220> July<00:02:37.350> so

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
term top around the middle of July so

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.400 
term top around the middle of July so
we're<00:02:38.950> not<00:02:39.100> quite<00:02:39.730> ready<00:02:39.970> to<00:02:40.270> jump<00:02:40.630> full<00:02:40.990> speed

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
we're not quite ready to jump full speed

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.000 
we're not quite ready to jump full speed
in<00:02:41.620> but<00:02:42.660> longer-term<00:02:43.660> it's<00:02:44.230> going<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.560> go<00:02:44.650> back

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
in but longer-term it's going to go back

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.949 
in but longer-term it's going to go back
we<00:02:45.250> think<00:02:45.550> to<00:02:45.730> where<00:02:45.970> its<00:02:46.270> highs<00:02:46.510> where<00:02:46.810> it's

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
we think to where its highs where it's

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.630 
we think to where its highs where it's
hard<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.440> imagine<00:02:47.680> right<00:02:48.070> now<00:02:48.220> but<00:02:48.430> again

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
hard to imagine right now but again

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.360 
hard to imagine right now but again
based<00:02:48.910> on<00:02:49.150> our<00:02:49.300> mathematical<00:02:50.130> algorithms<00:02:51.130> it

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
based on our mathematical algorithms it

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
based on our mathematical algorithms it
seems<00:02:51.700> that's<00:02:51.880> where<00:02:52.060> it's<00:02:52.150> going<00:02:52.270> to<00:02:52.330> go

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
seems that's where it's going to go

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.479 
seems that's where it's going to go
David<00:02:53.200> would<00:02:53.320> you<00:02:53.470> say<00:02:53.680> there's<00:02:53.950> just<00:02:54.220> been<00:02:54.370> an

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
David would you say there's just been an

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.729 
David would you say there's just been an
overreaction<00:02:55.060> well<00:02:55.930> that<00:02:56.050> seems<00:02:56.350> to<00:02:56.560> happen

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
overreaction well that seems to happen

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.699 
overreaction well that seems to happen
in<00:02:57.070> all<00:02:57.220> markets<00:02:57.670> look<00:02:58.120> at<00:02:58.270> stocks<00:02:58.989> you<00:02:59.590> know

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
in all markets look at stocks you know

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.949 
in all markets look at stocks you know
last<00:02:59.920> four<00:03:00.190> years<00:03:00.400> of<00:03:00.459> doubled<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.300> go<00:03:01.720> get

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
last four years of doubled and go get

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.720 
last four years of doubled and go get
your<00:03:02.170> printing<00:03:02.620> people<00:03:02.980> think<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.280> printing

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
your printing people think the printing

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.400 
your printing people think the printing
led<00:03:03.880> to<00:03:04.030> it<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.239> cycles<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:04.810> targets<00:03:05.230> show

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
led to it the cycles and targets show

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.010 
led to it the cycles and targets show
that<00:03:05.620> as<00:03:05.770> well<00:03:06.010> um<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:07.420> know<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.540> markets<00:03:07.930> are

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
that as well um you know the markets are

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.650 
that as well um you know the markets are
emotional<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:08.590> by<00:03:09.459> definition<00:03:09.790> that's<00:03:10.420> what

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
emotional and by definition that's what

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.470 
emotional and by definition that's what
we<00:03:10.780> assume<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.410> cycles<00:03:11.860> don't<00:03:12.070> show<00:03:12.310> what<00:03:12.610> it

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
we assume the cycles don't show what it

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.030 
we assume the cycles don't show what it
what's<00:03:13.930> going<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.320> happen<00:03:14.709> it's<00:03:14.830> how<00:03:14.980> the

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
what's going to happen it's how the

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.970 
what's going to happen it's how the
reaction<00:03:15.730> is<00:03:15.850> going<00:03:16.030> to<00:03:16.120> be<00:03:16.180> so<00:03:17.049> yeah<00:03:17.500> people

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
reaction is going to be so yeah people

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.610 
reaction is going to be so yeah people
have<00:03:18.160> definitely<00:03:19.019> capitulated<00:03:20.019> and<00:03:20.230> you've

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
have definitely capitulated and you've

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.110 
have definitely capitulated and you've
got<00:03:20.739> all<00:03:20.950> sorts<00:03:21.100> of<00:03:21.310> pressure<00:03:21.610> and<00:03:21.880> you've<00:03:22.000> got

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
got all sorts of pressure and you've got

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.420 
got all sorts of pressure and you've got
currency<00:03:22.720> issues<00:03:23.110> that<00:03:23.470> people<00:03:23.950> think<00:03:24.280> of

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
currency issues that people think of

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.190 
currency issues that people think of
affecting<00:03:24.940> it<00:03:25.090> which<00:03:25.299> we<00:03:25.600> don't<00:03:25.810> but<00:03:26.049> that

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
affecting it which we don't but that

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.170 
affecting it which we don't but that
seems<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.709> be<00:03:26.739> what's<00:03:27.130> causing<00:03:27.340> it<00:03:27.670> so<00:03:28.030> the

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
seems to be what's causing it so the

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.240 
seems to be what's causing it so the
cycles<00:03:28.690> you<00:03:28.810> look<00:03:29.290> at<00:03:29.500> David<00:03:29.739> obviously

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
cycles you look at David obviously

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.610 
cycles you look at David obviously
there's<00:03:30.430> an<00:03:30.519> algorithm<00:03:31.090> behind<00:03:31.239> this<00:03:31.780> is<00:03:31.989> this

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
there's an algorithm behind this is this

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.370 
there's an algorithm behind this is this
a<00:03:32.830> patent<00:03:33.400> you<00:03:33.610> have<00:03:33.880> yeah<00:03:34.450> Charles<00:03:34.959> came<00:03:35.230> up

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
a patent you have yeah Charles came up

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.630 
a patent you have yeah Charles came up
with<00:03:35.560> this<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:35.739> it's<00:03:36.040> a<00:03:36.160> very<00:03:36.340> good<00:03:36.400> question

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
with this and it's a very good question

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.250 
with this and it's a very good question

gold<00:05:08.440> David<00:05:08.830> do<00:05:09.160> you<00:05:09.190> also<00:05:09.490> look<00:05:10.000> at<00:05:10.180> the

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
gold David do you also look at the

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.689 
gold David do you also look at the
fundamentals<00:05:11.080> you<00:05:11.259> track<00:05:11.620> the<00:05:11.770> US<00:05:12.070> dollar<00:05:12.370> do

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
fundamentals you track the US dollar do

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:14.279 
fundamentals you track the US dollar do
you<00:05:12.729> pay<00:05:12.970> attention<00:05:13.060> when<00:05:13.570> ben<00:05:13.780> bernanke

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
you pay attention when ben bernanke

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:19.260 
you pay attention when ben bernanke
speaks<00:05:14.410> no<00:05:15.280> we<00:05:15.759> look<00:05:16.150> at<00:05:17.160> the<00:05:18.160> dollar<00:05:18.430> for<00:05:19.060> sure

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
speaks no we look at the dollar for sure

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.270 
speaks no we look at the dollar for sure
we<00:05:19.570> look<00:05:19.750> at<00:05:19.870> currencies<00:05:20.380> we<00:05:20.590> cut<00:05:20.830> we<00:05:20.949> track

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
we look at currencies we cut we track

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.219 
we look at currencies we cut we track
currencies<00:05:21.729> based<00:05:21.940> on<00:05:22.120> cycles<00:05:22.599> but<00:05:23.050> we

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
currencies based on cycles but we

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:24.719 
currencies based on cycles but we
actually<00:05:23.410> think<00:05:23.860> cycles<00:05:24.370> are<00:05:24.460> the<00:05:24.550> most

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
actually think cycles are the most

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.439 
actually think cycles are the most
fundamental<00:05:26.190> form<00:05:27.190> of<00:05:27.400> predicting<00:05:28.120> there<00:05:28.300> is

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 
fundamental form of predicting there is

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:30.330 
fundamental form of predicting there is
and<00:05:28.750> as<00:05:29.080> people<00:05:29.410> say<00:05:29.590> its<00:05:29.740> technical<00:05:30.250> they

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
and as people say its technical they

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.820 
and as people say its technical they
dismiss<00:05:30.760> it<00:05:30.970> so<00:05:31.270> discussing<00:05:31.930> short-term<00:05:32.590> now

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
dismiss it so discussing short-term now

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.920 
dismiss it so discussing short-term now
David<00:05:33.220> where<00:05:33.460> do<00:05:33.580> you<00:05:33.669> see<00:05:33.940> gold<00:05:34.240> let's<00:05:34.599> say<00:05:34.780> up

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
David where do you see gold let's say up

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.320 
David where do you see gold let's say up
until<00:05:35.080> September<00:05:35.770> that's<00:05:36.340> what<00:05:36.580> I<00:05:36.610> don't<00:05:37.150> have

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
until September that's what I don't have

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.180 
until September that's what I don't have
an<00:05:37.479> answer<00:05:37.630> generally<00:05:38.260> the<00:05:38.349> way<00:05:38.560> it<00:05:38.650> works<00:05:38.889> is

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
an answer generally the way it works is

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.659 
an answer generally the way it works is
we<00:05:39.580> can<00:05:39.820> give<00:05:40.090> you<00:05:40.240> a<00:05:40.270> target<00:05:40.930> up<00:05:41.520> after<00:05:42.520> it

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
we can give you a target up after it

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:44.370 
we can give you a target up after it
bottoms<00:05:43.150> and<00:05:43.389> we're<00:05:43.539> able<00:05:43.720> to<00:05:43.990> do<00:05:44.139> what's

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
bottoms and we're able to do what's

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.310 
bottoms and we're able to do what's
called<00:05:44.590> momentum<00:05:44.860> studies<00:05:45.699> I<00:05:45.940> we<00:05:46.930> can't<00:05:47.169> do

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
called momentum studies I we can't do

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.500 
called momentum studies I we can't do
those<00:05:47.470> now<00:05:47.680> so<00:05:48.010> I<00:05:48.039> can't<00:05:48.370> give<00:05:48.610> you<00:05:48.639> a<00:05:48.789> number

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
those now so I can't give you a number

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.899 
those now so I can't give you a number
in<00:05:49.840> September<00:05:50.500> you<00:05:51.099> know<00:05:51.190> people<00:05:51.580> always<00:05:51.669> say

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:51.909 
in September you know people always say

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:53.430 
in September you know people always say
wouldn't<00:05:52.210> be<00:05:52.270> nice<00:05:52.419> to<00:05:52.630> be<00:05:52.659> sitting<00:05:52.930> on<00:05:53.110> a<00:05:53.169> boat

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
wouldn't be nice to be sitting on a boat

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.960 
wouldn't be nice to be sitting on a boat
and<00:05:53.470> just<00:05:53.860> know<00:05:54.010> it's<00:05:54.190> up<00:05:54.370> for<00:05:54.520> two<00:05:54.669> months

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
and just know it's up for two months

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.270 
and just know it's up for two months
down<00:05:55.150> for<00:05:55.389> four<00:05:55.570> months<00:05:55.750> you<00:05:56.710> know<00:05:56.860> but<00:05:57.190> it

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
down for four months you know but it

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.670 
down for four months you know but it
doesn't<00:05:57.639> work<00:05:57.669> that<00:05:57.759> way<00:05:58.120> we're<00:05:58.509> precise<00:05:59.169> so

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
doesn't work that way we're precise so

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.189 
doesn't work that way we're precise so
you'd<00:05:59.860> be<00:06:00.039> able<00:06:00.099> to<00:06:00.250> track<00:06:00.639> as<00:06:00.909> of<00:06:01.090> when<00:06:01.300> when

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:02.199 
you'd be able to track as of when when

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:05.010 
you'd be able to track as of when when
the<00:06:02.500> bottom<00:06:02.949> hits<00:06:03.220> and<00:06:03.580> it<00:06:03.940> goes<00:06:04.360> up<00:06:04.599> in<00:06:04.990> the

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
the bottom hits and it goes up in the

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.140 
the bottom hits and it goes up in the
cycles<00:06:05.620> of<00:06:05.740> war<00:06:05.949> bottom<00:06:06.430> then<00:06:06.610> our<00:06:06.729> target

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
cycles of war bottom then our target

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.700 
cycles of war bottom then our target
algorithms<00:06:07.659> bottom<00:06:08.020> it<00:06:08.110> goes<00:06:08.259> in<00:06:08.440> a<00:06:08.500> buy

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
algorithms bottom it goes in a buy

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.920 
algorithms bottom it goes in a buy
signal<00:06:08.770> then<00:06:09.610> able<00:06:10.090> to<00:06:10.210> give<00:06:10.330> a<00:06:10.360> target<00:06:10.810> that's

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
signal then able to give a target that's

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.839 
signal then able to give a target that's
why<00:06:11.080> I<00:06:11.139> want<00:06:11.409> the<00:06:11.560> readers<00:06:11.860> the<00:06:12.190> listeners<00:06:12.639> to

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:12.849 
why I want the readers the listeners to

who are not crying I'm getting those we

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:27.570 
who are not crying I'm getting those we
had<00:06:25.840> said<00:06:26.110> to<00:06:26.139> hedge<00:06:26.500> you<00:06:27.099> know<00:06:27.190> we<00:06:27.340> gave<00:06:27.550> a

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
had said to hedge you know we gave a

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.020 
had said to hedge you know we gave a
target<00:06:28.030> at<00:06:28.120> 1285<00:06:28.979> when<00:06:29.979> it<00:06:30.250> we<00:06:30.460> said<00:06:30.699> it<00:06:30.880> was

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
target at 1285 when it we said it was

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.990 
target at 1285 when it we said it was
get<00:06:31.539> out<00:06:31.630> 1900<00:06:32.409> so<00:06:32.530> so<00:06:32.740> far<00:06:33.009> pretty<00:06:33.759> good

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
get out 1900 so so far pretty good

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.969 
get out 1900 so so far pretty good
predicting<00:06:35.039> when<00:06:36.039> it<00:06:36.159> got<00:06:36.310> past<00:06:36.700> 12<00:06:37.000> 85<00:06:37.979> again

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:38.979 
predicting when it got past 12 85 again

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:40.239 
predicting when it got past 12 85 again
we<00:06:39.219> told<00:06:39.460> those

00:06:40.239 --> 00:06:40.249 
we told those

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:42.249 
we told those
you<00:06:40.309> know<00:06:40.429> go<00:06:40.729> along<00:06:41.089> and<00:06:41.509> many<00:06:41.719> people<00:06:42.139> are

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:42.259 
you know go along and many people are

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:46.299 
you know go along and many people are
holding<00:06:42.439> physical<00:06:43.189> gold<00:06:43.429> to<00:06:44.419> hedge<00:06:45.309> gold

stocks will not be as strong as gold in
our<00:06:49.699> opinion<00:06:49.819> that's<00:06:50.299> the<00:06:50.449> first<00:06:50.689> thing<00:06:50.779> we're

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:50.989 
our opinion that's the first thing we're

00:06:50.989 --> 00:06:53.649 
our opinion that's the first thing we're
telling<00:06:51.289> everybody<00:06:51.529> and<00:06:52.189> we<00:06:53.059> think<00:06:53.269> that<00:06:53.539> they

00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:53.659 
telling everybody and we think that they

planning<00:07:12.079> to<00:07:12.259> short<00:07:12.619> bonds<00:07:13.279> because<00:07:13.549> we've

00:07:13.929 --> 00:07:13.939 
planning to short bonds because we've

00:07:13.939 --> 00:07:17.199 
planning to short bonds because we've
had<00:07:14.089> a<00:07:14.119> 30-year<00:07:14.929> bond<00:07:15.429> increase<00:07:16.429> rates<00:07:17.029> have

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:17.209 
had a 30-year bond increase rates have

00:07:17.209 --> 00:07:19.419 
had a 30-year bond increase rates have
gone<00:07:17.239> down<00:07:17.419> for<00:07:17.869> 30<00:07:18.049> years<00:07:18.289> as<00:07:18.559> a<00:07:18.589> 60<00:07:19.069> year<00:07:19.159> bond

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:19.429 
gone down for 30 years as a 60 year bond

00:07:19.429 --> 00:07:22.899 
gone down for 30 years as a 60 year bond
cycle<00:07:20.079> so<00:07:21.339> bonds<00:07:22.339> are<00:07:22.429> going<00:07:22.549> to<00:07:22.610> be<00:07:22.699> a<00:07:22.729> good

00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:22.909 
cycle so bonds are going to be a good

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:26.709 
cycle so bonds are going to be a good
short<00:07:23.239> for<00:07:23.569> many<00:07:23.749> years<00:07:24.079> we<00:07:24.860> think<00:07:25.219> nat<00:07:26.029> gas<00:07:26.299> is

00:07:26.709 --> 00:07:26.719 
short for many years we think nat gas is

00:07:26.719 --> 00:07:28.839 
short for many years we think nat gas is
near<00:07:27.289> a<00:07:27.319> short<00:07:27.679> term<00:07:27.829> bottom<00:07:28.309> but<00:07:28.489> longer-term

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:28.849 
near a short term bottom but longer-term

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:31.299 
near a short term bottom but longer-term
it's<00:07:29.209> down<00:07:29.479> we<00:07:30.169> think<00:07:30.409> that<00:07:30.469> the<00:07:30.649> US<00:07:30.949> dollar

00:07:31.299 --> 00:07:31.309 
it's down we think that the US dollar

00:07:31.309 --> 00:07:33.519 
it's down we think that the US dollar
will<00:07:31.699> be<00:07:31.849> hitting<00:07:32.089> a<00:07:32.269> top<00:07:32.509> next<00:07:32.809> year<00:07:33.169> and<00:07:33.379> then

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:33.529 
will be hitting a top next year and then

00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:35.169 
will be hitting a top next year and then
down<00:07:33.829> so<00:07:34.159> that<00:07:34.189> something<00:07:34.639> people<00:07:34.999> should

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:35.179 
down so that something people should

00:07:35.179 --> 00:07:37.929 
down so that something people should
look<00:07:35.509> at<00:07:35.719> and<00:07:35.989> it's<00:07:36.829> really<00:07:37.219> so<00:07:37.459> much<00:07:37.639> the<00:07:37.819> way

00:07:37.929 --> 00:07:37.939 
look at and it's really so much the way

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:39.279 
look at and it's really so much the way
we<00:07:37.969> do<00:07:38.329> things<00:07:38.509> because<00:07:38.719> we<00:07:38.899> don't<00:07:39.079> manage

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:39.289
