call<00:00:07.859> magic<00:00:08.130> leverage<00:00:08.820> I<00:00:09.030> think<00:00:09.500> but<00:00:10.500> it<00:00:10.889> looks

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
call magic leverage I think but it looks

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.209 
call magic leverage I think but it looks
like<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.280> curlformer<00:00:11.969> it's<00:00:12.120> pretty<00:00:12.330> much<00:00:12.509> the

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:13.219 
like a curlformer it's pretty much the

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.490 
like a curlformer it's pretty much the
exact<00:00:14.219> thing<00:00:14.519> that<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:15.269> curlformer<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.170> it's

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
exact thing that a curlformer is it's

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.040 
exact thing that a curlformer is it's
just<00:00:16.740> not<00:00:17.250> oh<00:00:17.580> this<00:00:17.850> is<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.180> wand<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.840> didn't

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
just not oh this is the wand it didn't

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.250 
just not oh this is the wand it didn't
come<00:00:19.260> together<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:20.130> put<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.609> together<00:00:21.109> but<00:00:22.109> this

wand is a little tricky if you're used
to<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.729> curlformers<00:01:05.729> but<00:01:06.180> because<00:01:06.450> I'm<00:01:06.540> not<00:01:06.780> I

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
to the curlformers but because I'm not I

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.740 
to the curlformers but because I'm not I
hopefully<00:01:08.549> I'll<00:01:08.909> be<00:01:08.939> okay

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750

and<00:02:10.289> my<00:02:10.470> one<00:02:10.740> thing<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:12.290> I<00:02:13.290> put<00:02:14.870> like<00:02:15.870> it

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
and my one thing and I put like it

and my one thing and I put like it
through<00:02:16.470> one<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.860> openings<00:02:17.900> like<00:02:18.900> this

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
through one of the openings like this

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.350 
through one of the openings like this
all<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:21.000> way<00:02:21.030> through<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:22.280> then<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.970> actually

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
all the way through and then I actually

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.830 
all the way through and then I actually
ended<00:02:24.930> up<00:02:25.020> detangling<00:02:25.739> my<00:02:25.800> hair<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.840> decided

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
ended up detangling my hair I decided

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.690 
ended up detangling my hair I decided
that<00:02:28.319> maybe<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:28.860> would<00:02:28.950> come<00:02:29.190> out<00:02:29.220> better<00:02:29.520> and

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
that maybe it would come out better and

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.340 
that maybe it would come out better and
you<00:02:30.209> know<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.420> first<00:02:30.630> time<00:02:30.840> doing<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.230> I

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
you know the first time doing it I

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.890 
you know the first time doing it I
wanted<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.860> come<00:02:32.489> out<00:02:32.610> as<00:02:32.790> nice<00:02:33.330> as<00:02:33.569> it<00:02:33.720> could

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
wanted to come out as nice as it could

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.860 
wanted to come out as nice as it could
so<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.950> took<00:02:35.430> like<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.730> little<00:02:36.000> section<00:02:36.450> of<00:02:36.660> my

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
so I took like a little section of my

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.470 
so I took like a little section of my
hair<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.470> i<00:02:37.590> detangled<00:02:38.220> it<00:02:38.340> with<00:02:38.580> my<00:02:38.790> pin<00:02:39.000> my

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
hair and i detangled it with my pin my

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.470 
hair and i detangled it with my pin my
Denman<00:02:39.840> brush<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.459> then<00:02:41.459> I<00:02:41.489> like<00:02:41.910> twist<00:02:42.330> at

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
Denman brush and then I like twist at

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.890 
Denman brush and then I like twist at
the<00:02:42.540> top<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.810> little<00:02:43.080> bit<00:02:43.230> so<00:02:43.980> that<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.610> wand

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
the top a little bit so that the wand

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.259 
the top a little bit so that the wand
could<00:02:45.900> catch<00:02:46.170> on<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.800> hair<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.430> then<00:02:48.030> once

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
could catch on to the hair and then once

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.900 
could catch on to the hair and then once
it<00:02:48.390> was<00:02:48.420> on<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:49.049> just<00:02:49.500> pulled<00:02:49.799> it<00:02:49.980> through<00:02:50.010> and

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
it was on I just pulled it through and

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.520 
it was on I just pulled it through and
out<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.930> as<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.799> can<00:02:52.920> see<00:02:52.980> my<00:02:53.700> short<00:02:54.120> hair<00:02:54.530> is

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
out and as you can see my short hair is

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.630 
out and as you can see my short hair is
in<00:02:55.890> it<00:02:56.569> so<00:02:57.569> yeah<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.230> it<00:02:58.830> took<00:02:59.069> a<00:02:59.130> little<00:02:59.459> while

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
in it so yeah and it took a little while

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.460 
in it so yeah and it took a little while
I<00:03:00.540> thought<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:00.959> was<00:03:01.080> gonna<00:03:01.170> be<00:03:01.350> a<00:03:01.380> little

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
I thought it was gonna be a little

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.770 
I thought it was gonna be a little
faster<00:03:02.040> but<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:03.060> think<00:03:03.269> it<00:03:03.330> was<00:03:03.420> cuz<00:03:03.600> I<00:03:03.660> was

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
faster but I think it was cuz I was

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.170 
faster but I think it was cuz I was
getting<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.110> hang<00:03:04.290> of<00:03:04.410> it<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:04.799> like<00:03:05.790> I<00:03:05.910> kept

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
getting the hang of it and like I kept

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.990 
getting the hang of it and like I kept
getting<00:03:06.330> like<00:03:07.140> little<00:03:07.260> snags<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.220> sometimes

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
getting like little snags and sometimes

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.250 
getting like little snags and sometimes
it<00:03:09.120> was<00:03:09.209> hard<00:03:09.239> for<00:03:09.480> me<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:09.720> pull<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.049> hair

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
it was hard for me to pull the hair

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.050 
it was hard for me to pull the hair
through<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.890> I<00:03:11.040> would<00:03:11.190> realize<00:03:11.370> maybe<00:03:11.700> I<00:03:11.850> had

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
through and I would realize maybe I had

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.330 
through and I would realize maybe I had
too<00:03:12.209> much<00:03:12.480> hair<00:03:12.870> on<00:03:13.230> it<00:03:13.950> also<00:03:15.859> what<00:03:16.859> I<00:03:16.890> forgot

eight<00:03:34.260> left<00:03:35.130> in<00:03:35.640> here<00:03:36.150> so<00:03:36.959> what's<00:03:37.709> that<00:03:37.829> I<00:03:37.980> use

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310

thirty two of these in my hair so I

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.120

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
think I got a good pack because I think

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.699 
think I got a good pack because I think
the<00:03:44.280> size<00:03:44.910> before<00:03:45.510> that<00:03:45.750> was<00:03:46.019> like<00:03:46.230> twenty

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
the size before that was like twenty

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.520 
the size before that was like twenty
four<00:03:47.010> so<00:03:47.970> I<00:03:48.000> would<00:03:48.450> have<00:03:48.540> had<00:03:48.690> like<00:03:48.870> really<00:03:49.290> big

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
four so I would have had like really big

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.680 
four so I would have had like really big
chunks<00:03:50.220> of<00:03:50.280> hair<00:03:50.549> in<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.739> or<00:03:52.739> just<00:03:53.100> ran<00:03:53.400> out<00:03:53.690> and

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
chunks of hair in it or just ran out and

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.170 
chunks of hair in it or just ran out and
next<00:03:55.230> time<00:03:55.380> I'll<00:03:55.590> know<00:03:55.829> that<00:03:55.859> I<00:03:56.130> can<00:03:56.430> you<00:03:57.060> know

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
next time I'll know that I can you know

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.080 
next time I'll know that I can you know
use<00:03:57.510> smaller<00:03:57.959> slightly<00:03:58.829> smaller<00:03:59.430> sections

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
use smaller slightly smaller sections

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.729 
use smaller slightly smaller sections
because<00:04:00.630> I<00:04:00.840> was<00:04:01.049> scared<00:04:01.410> that<00:04:01.440> I<00:04:01.590> was<00:04:01.680> gonna

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
because I was scared that I was gonna

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.520 
because I was scared that I was gonna
run<00:04:02.040> out<00:04:02.220> and<00:04:02.459> I<00:04:02.730> do<00:04:02.790> only<00:04:03.090> have<00:04:03.420> eight<00:04:03.690> left<00:04:04.079> so

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
run out and I do only have eight left so

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.830 
run out and I do only have eight left so
I<00:04:04.890> can<00:04:05.370> use<00:04:05.489> slightly<00:04:05.730> smaller<00:04:06.180> sections<00:04:06.660> in

leverage<00:06:33.639> thing<00:06:34.270> cuz<00:06:34.629> I<00:06:35.529> don't<00:06:35.830> see<00:06:36.249> it

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.370 
leverage thing cuz I don't see it

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.749 
leverage thing cuz I don't see it
difference<00:06:36.759> and<00:06:37.889> you<00:06:38.889> know<00:06:39.009> a<00:06:39.039> curlformer

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:39.759 
difference and you know a curlformer

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:41.700 
difference and you know a curlformer
I've<00:06:39.909> never<00:06:40.120> tried<00:06:40.360> to<00:06:40.479> curlformer<00:06:41.080> but<00:06:41.349> from

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
I've never tried to curlformer but from

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.100 
I've never tried to curlformer but from
what<00:06:41.889> I've<00:06:42.009> seen<00:06:42.039> on<00:06:42.339> YouTube<00:06:42.789> and<00:06:43.210> on

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110 
what I've seen on YouTube and on

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.749 
what I've seen on YouTube and on
Pinterest<00:06:44.680> and<00:06:44.860> all<00:06:45.009> that<00:06:45.159> other<00:06:45.249> stuff<00:06:45.370> I

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 
Pinterest and all that other stuff I

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:50.070 
Pinterest and all that other stuff I
don't<00:06:46.389> see<00:06:46.569> a<00:06:46.599> big<00:06:46.810> difference<00:06:47.939> as<00:06:48.939> far<00:06:49.779> as

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
don't see a big difference as far as

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.469 
don't see a big difference as far as
like<00:06:50.610> difficulty<00:06:51.610> goes<00:06:51.789> putting<00:06:52.120> them<00:06:52.240> in

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 
like difficulty goes putting them in

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:54.779 
like difficulty goes putting them in
compared<00:06:53.020> to<00:06:53.139> curlformers<00:06:53.770> I<00:06:53.889> wouldn't<00:06:54.610> know

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:54.789 
compared to curlformers I wouldn't know

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:58.019 
compared to curlformers I wouldn't know
because<00:06:54.999> I<00:06:55.240> never<00:06:55.300> used<00:06:55.810> curlformers<00:06:57.029> and

00:06:58.019 --> 00:06:58.029 
because I never used curlformers and

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:00.689 
because I never used curlformers and
then<00:06:58.360> you<00:06:59.289> know<00:06:59.439> it<00:06:59.680> did<00:06:59.889> kind<00:07:00.219> of<00:07:00.279> suck<00:07:00.520> that

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:00.699 
then you know it did kind of suck that

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:02.309 
then you know it did kind of suck that
they<00:07:00.879> were<00:07:00.999> like<00:07:01.180> no<00:07:01.389> instructions<00:07:02.020> and<00:07:02.229> I

00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:02.319 
they were like no instructions and I

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:04.260 
they were like no instructions and I
didn't<00:07:02.589> know<00:07:02.710> what<00:07:03.430> the<00:07:03.669> difference<00:07:04.089> was

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:04.270 
didn't know what the difference was

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.389 
didn't know what the difference was
between<00:07:04.330> pink<00:07:04.960> and<00:07:05.139> orange<00:07:05.379> I<00:07:05.889> figured<00:07:06.249> that

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:06.399 
between pink and orange I figured that

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:08.790 
between pink and orange I figured that
orange<00:07:06.849> was<00:07:07.509> a<00:07:07.539> little<00:07:07.870> tighter<00:07:08.199> curls<00:07:08.649> or

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 
orange was a little tighter curls or

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.339 
orange was a little tighter curls or
bigger<00:07:08.979> curls<00:07:09.279> whatever<00:07:10.080> you<00:07:11.080> know<00:07:11.169> there

00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:11.349 
bigger curls whatever you know there

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:12.839 
bigger curls whatever you know there
were<00:07:11.409> no<00:07:11.560> instructions<00:07:11.830> I<00:07:12.189> came<00:07:12.370> in<00:07:12.520> the<00:07:12.639> bag

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:12.849 
were no instructions I came in the bag

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:15.570 
were no instructions I came in the bag
but<00:07:13.839> if<00:07:14.259> you<00:07:14.499> watched<00:07:14.860> a<00:07:15.069> whole<00:07:15.219> bunch<00:07:15.430> of

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:15.580 
but if you watched a whole bunch of

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:20.730 
but if you watched a whole bunch of
YouTube<00:07:15.909> videos<00:07:16.210> like<00:07:17.199> I<00:07:17.409> do<00:07:17.490> then<00:07:19.740> it

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:20.740 
YouTube videos like I do then it

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.110 
YouTube videos like I do then it
shouldn't<00:07:21.009> matter<00:07:21.279> because<00:07:21.639> you<00:07:21.909> already

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.120 
shouldn't matter because you already

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.159 
shouldn't matter because you already
kind<00:07:22.300> of<00:07:22.389> know<00:07:22.539> what<00:07:22.779> to<00:07:22.930> do<00:07:23.639> and<00:07:24.639> it<00:07:25.270> was<00:07:25.479> this
