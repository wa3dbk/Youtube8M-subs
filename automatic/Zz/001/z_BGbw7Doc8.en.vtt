second<00:00:42.930> just<00:00:42.989> looking<00:00:43.290> at<00:00:43.410> this<00:00:44.780> so<00:00:45.780> yeah<00:00:45.930> here

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
second just looking at this so yeah here

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.529 
second just looking at this so yeah here
are<00:00:46.320> monsters<00:00:46.920> spawning<00:00:47.340> all<00:00:47.730> monster<00:00:48.180> cages

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
are monsters spawning all monster cages

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.619 
are monsters spawning all monster cages
so<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.980> question<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.700> answered<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.539> I'm

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
so that question is answered and I'm

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.810 
so that question is answered and I'm
going<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.020> hop<00:00:52.230> over<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.530> MCEdit<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.370> put<00:00:53.640> some

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
going to hop over to MCEdit and put some

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.450 
going to hop over to MCEdit and put some
half<00:00:54.090> slabs<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.079> see<00:00:55.710> if<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.860> fixes

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
half slabs on this and see if that fixes

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.430 
half slabs on this and see if that fixes
the<00:00:56.640> problem<00:00:57.030> pretty<00:00:57.360> sure<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.570> will<00:00:57.690> but

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
the problem pretty sure it will but

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.650 
the problem pretty sure it will but
let's<00:00:59.070> see<00:01:00.079> okay<00:01:01.079> we're<00:01:01.320> back<00:01:02.270> we've<00:01:03.270> placed

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
let's see okay we're back we've placed

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.020 
let's see okay we're back we've placed
some<00:01:04.019> half<00:01:04.710> slabs<00:01:05.040> here<00:01:05.280> over<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.729> spawners

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
some half slabs here over the spawners

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.469 
some half slabs here over the spawners
and<00:01:07.130> I<00:01:08.130> was<00:01:08.490> actually<00:01:08.610> surprised<00:01:09.119> that

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
and I was actually surprised that

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.050 
and I was actually surprised that
monsters<00:01:10.290> spawned<00:01:10.710> all<00:01:11.100> monster<00:01:11.670> spawners<00:01:11.880> I

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
monsters spawned all monster spawners I

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.440 
monsters spawned all monster spawners I
thought<00:01:12.270> they<00:01:12.390> actually<00:01:12.630> counted<00:01:12.990> as

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
thought they actually counted as

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.030 
thought they actually counted as
transparent<00:01:15.450> blocks<00:01:15.659> because<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.200> can<00:01:16.350> well

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
transparent blocks because you can well

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.370 
transparent blocks because you can well
you<00:01:17.280> can<00:01:17.430> see<00:01:17.580> through<00:01:17.759> them<00:01:17.880> but<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.869> guess

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
you can see through them but I guess

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.969 
you can see through them but I guess
they<00:01:19.530> don't<00:01:20.869> an<00:01:21.869> easy<00:01:22.320> way<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.530> test<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.920> I

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
they don't an easy way to test that I

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.950 
they don't an easy way to test that I
guess<00:01:23.189> would<00:01:23.340> be<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.580> see<00:01:23.790> if<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.150> stick<00:01:24.689> my<00:01:24.720> head

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
guess would be to see if I stick my head

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.390 
guess would be to see if I stick my head
in<00:01:25.080> one<00:01:25.320> with<00:01:25.560> him<00:01:25.680> see<00:01:25.830> at<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.100> see<00:01:26.220> if<00:01:26.310> I

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
in one with him see at it and see if I

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.160 
in one with him see at it and see if I
get<00:01:26.520> suffocated<00:01:28.549> but<00:01:29.549> another<00:01:30.509> good<00:01:30.900> evidence

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
get suffocated but another good evidence

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.499 
get suffocated but another good evidence
is<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:32.420> monsters<00:01:33.420> don't<00:01:33.540> spawn<00:01:35.240> yeah<00:01:36.240> so

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
is that monsters don't spawn yeah so

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.350 
is that monsters don't spawn yeah so
okay<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.259> half<00:01:37.619> slabs<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.610> top<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.030> monster

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
okay so half slabs on top of monster

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.270 
okay so half slabs on top of monster
spawners<00:01:39.630> will<00:01:39.960> stop<00:01:40.229> creatures<00:01:41.220> from

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
spawners will stop creatures from

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.550 
spawners will stop creatures from
spawning<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:41.909> if<00:01:42.030> you've<00:01:42.150> made<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.960> grinder<00:01:43.409> and

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
spawning so if you've made a grinder and

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.639 
spawning so if you've made a grinder and
have<00:01:43.799> been<00:01:44.009> getting<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:45.210> odd<00:01:45.439> monster<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.530> it

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
have been getting the odd monster in it

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:47.749 
have been getting the odd monster in it
and<00:01:46.770> you're<00:01:46.860> wondering<00:01:47.340> where<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.520> comes<00:01:47.700> from

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
and you're wondering where it comes from

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.109 
and you're wondering where it comes from
they<00:01:48.180> are<00:01:48.329> indeed<00:01:49.009> spawning<00:01:50.009> on<00:01:50.790> top<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.060> the

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
they are indeed spawning on top of the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.060 
they are indeed spawning on top of the
mob<00:01:51.329> cages<00:01:51.750> here<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:53.180> and<00:01:54.590> I<00:01:55.590> just<00:01:55.770> want<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.920> see

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
mob cages here so and I just want to see

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.539 
mob cages here so and I just want to see

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
this again let me clear off a few of

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.069 
this again let me clear off a few of
these<00:02:02.640> half<00:02:02.850> slabs<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.590> we<00:02:04.590> will<00:02:04.799> get<00:02:05.990> just<00:02:06.990> to

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
these half slabs and we will get just to

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.370 
these half slabs and we will get just to
demonstrate<00:02:07.229> this<00:02:07.619> again<00:02:07.890> let<00:02:08.099> me<00:02:08.539> remove<00:02:09.539> my

monster<00:02:18.030> spawning<00:02:20.390> okay<00:02:21.390> um<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:21.960> actually<00:02:22.110> had

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
monster spawning okay um I actually had

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.550 
monster spawning okay um I actually had
to<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:23.610> small<00:02:24.000> patch<00:02:24.270> of<00:02:24.300> exposed<00:02:25.260> spawner

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
to the small patch of exposed spawner

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.640 
to the small patch of exposed spawner
was<00:02:25.920> not<00:02:26.100> spawning<00:02:26.430> anything<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.140> I<00:02:28.140> had<00:02:28.560> to

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
was not spawning anything and I had to

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.980 
was not spawning anything and I had to
make<00:02:28.770> it<00:02:28.830> bigger<00:02:29.130> like<00:02:29.459> this<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:30.209> get<00:02:30.630> stuff<00:02:30.840> to

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
make it bigger like this to get stuff to

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.949 
make it bigger like this to get stuff to
spawn<00:02:31.310> not<00:02:32.310> sure<00:02:32.490> why<00:02:32.700> maybe<00:02:33.360> it's<00:02:33.660> some<00:02:33.840> sort

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
spawn not sure why maybe it's some sort

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.400 
spawn not sure why maybe it's some sort
of<00:02:34.080> odd<00:02:34.410> peculiarity<00:02:34.950> in<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:36.410> spawning

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
of odd peculiarity in the spawning

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.040 
of odd peculiarity in the spawning
algorithm<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.100> minecraft<00:02:38.520> has<00:02:41.570> so<00:02:42.570> I<00:02:42.870> guess

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
algorithm that minecraft has so I guess

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.990 
algorithm that minecraft has so I guess
that's<00:02:43.260> about<00:02:43.410> it<00:02:43.770> for<00:02:43.920> this<00:02:44.190> episode<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.880> know

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
that's about it for this episode I know

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.300 
that's about it for this episode I know
now<00:02:45.450> how<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:46.070> fix<00:02:47.070> my<00:02:47.780> monster<00:02:48.780> grinder<00:02:49.140> in<00:02:49.310> my

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
now how to fix my monster grinder in my

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.660 
now how to fix my monster grinder in my
dev<00:02:50.700> commentary<00:02:51.620> so<00:02:53.209> yeah<00:02:54.209> yeah<00:02:55.340> whoo<00:02:56.340> default

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
dev commentary so yeah yeah whoo default

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.540 
dev commentary so yeah yeah whoo default
I<00:02:56.880> always<00:02:57.360> thought<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:58.100> these<00:02:59.100> monster

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
I always thought that these monster

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.850 
I always thought that these monster
cages<00:02:59.910> were<00:03:02.930> transparent<00:03:03.930> so<00:03:04.260> monsters<00:03:04.739> would

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
cages were transparent so monsters would

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.150 
cages were transparent so monsters would
not<00:03:05.010> spawn<00:03:05.280> on<00:03:05.430> them<00:03:05.660> but<00:03:06.980> there's<00:03:07.980> the

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
not spawn on them but there's the

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.780 
not spawn on them but there's the
evidence<00:03:08.489> right<00:03:08.580> there<00:03:08.989> look<00:03:09.989> at<00:03:10.110> that<00:03:10.790> that's

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
evidence right there look at that that's

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.160 
evidence right there look at that that's
a<00:03:13.310> it's<00:03:14.310> max<00:03:14.580> bone<00:03:14.820> right<00:03:15.000> there<00:03:15.110> okay<00:03:16.110> so

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
a it's max bone right there okay so

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.539

that's

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.409 
that's
you<00:04:25.830> have<00:04:25.919> is<00:04:26.040> the<00:04:26.190> setup<00:04:26.430> I<00:04:26.580> was<00:04:26.669> just<00:04:27.150> pushing

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419

myself and trying to push myself into

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:30.920 
myself and trying to push myself into

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
one didn't work so hopefully that

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.430 
one didn't work so hopefully that
