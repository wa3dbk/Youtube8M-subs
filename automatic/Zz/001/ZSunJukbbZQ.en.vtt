00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
people think it's a shotgun because it

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.310 
people think it's a shotgun because it
only<00:01:56.189> fires<00:01:56.460> one<00:01:57.329> shot<00:01:57.360> at<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.840> time<00:01:58.049> then<00:01:58.290> you

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
range and then you're going to have the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.440 
range and then you're going to have the

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
like 70 damage to him it really is

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.850 
like 70 damage to him it really is

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
inconsistent I damage the only time you

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.700 
inconsistent I damage the only time you
can<00:02:29.370> really<00:02:29.640> rely<00:02:30.000> on<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.180> one<00:02:30.330> shot<00:02:30.570> kill

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710

excluding if you get a headshot is at

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.510 
excluding if you get a headshot is at
point-blank<00:02:33.510> I'm<00:02:33.930> in<00:02:34.050> your<00:02:34.170> face<00:02:34.200> range<00:02:34.680> now

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
point-blank I'm in your face range now

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.300 
point-blank I'm in your face range now
the<00:02:35.580> only<00:02:36.480> good<00:02:36.840> thing<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.740> only<00:02:37.920> good<00:02:38.280> thing

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
the only good thing the only good thing

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.250 
the only good thing the only good thing
that<00:02:38.460> this<00:02:38.670> has<00:02:38.850> over<00:02:39.270> shotguns<00:02:39.810> that<00:02:39.990> it<00:02:40.110> is

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
that this has over shotguns that it is

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.160 
that this has over shotguns that it is
wallbang<00:02:40.890> um<00:02:42.170> so<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:43.200> guess<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:43.890> have<00:02:44.070> a

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
wallbang um so I guess you have a

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.300 
wallbang um so I guess you have a
advantage<00:02:46.170> in<00:02:46.320> that<00:02:46.350> but<00:02:46.710> then<00:02:46.830> again<00:02:46.950> not

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
advantage in that but then again not

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.800 
advantage in that but then again not
really<00:02:47.670> because<00:02:47.820> you<00:02:48.060> have<00:02:48.180> one<00:02:48.210> ish<00:02:48.570> are

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
really because you have one ish are

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.960 
really because you have one ish are
coming<00:02:49.170> out<00:02:49.320> so<00:02:49.620> you<00:02:50.430> don't<00:02:50.460> you<00:02:50.760> might<00:02:50.880> not

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
coming out so you don't you might not

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.460 
coming out so you don't you might not
even<00:02:51.120> know<00:02:51.330> where<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.600> person<00:02:52.050> is<00:02:52.110> hiding

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
even know where the person is hiding

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.850 
even know where the person is hiding
behind<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.800> wall<00:02:52.980> so<00:02:53.870> you<00:02:54.870> know<00:02:54.960> overall<00:02:55.380> it's

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
behind the wall so you know overall it's

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.910 
behind the wall so you know overall it's
not<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:57.240> gray<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.750> only<00:02:58.050> other<00:02:58.260> improvement

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
not that gray the only other improvement

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.760 
not that gray the only other improvement
has<00:02:59.070> is<00:02:59.400> that<00:02:59.610> the<00:03:00.210> reload<00:03:00.600> time<00:03:00.630> per<00:03:01.140> shell<00:03:01.500> is

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
has is that the reload time per shell is

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.170 
has is that the reload time per shell is
greater<00:03:02.550> but<00:03:02.910> it<00:03:03.030> also<00:03:03.150> has<00:03:03.300> to<00:03:03.630> last<00:03:03.900> shots<00:03:04.500> in

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
greater but it also has to last shots in

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.600 
greater but it also has to last shots in
total<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:07.140> Winchester<00:03:07.590> has<00:03:07.710> 12<00:03:08.100> out<00:03:08.340> of<00:03:08.370> like

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
36 I think and this has 10 out of 30 but

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.910 
36 I think and this has 10 out of 30 but
