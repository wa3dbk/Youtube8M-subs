Trixie<00:04:49.110> stop<00:04:51.990> now<00:04:52.990> that's<00:04:53.170> it<00:04:53.380> so<00:04:53.680> the

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
Trixie stop now that's it so the

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.520 
Trixie stop now that's it so the
intention<00:04:55.150> now<00:04:55.300> is<00:04:55.480> to<00:04:55.660> create<00:04:55.960> some<00:04:56.230> guides

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
intention now is to create some guides

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.310 
intention now is to create some guides
for<00:04:57.130> people<00:04:57.430> to<00:04:57.520> be<00:04:57.610> able<00:04:57.670> to<00:04:57.850> follow

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
for people to be able to follow

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.040 
for people to be able to follow
hopefully<00:04:59.640> by<00:05:00.640> the<00:05:01.120> next<00:05:01.150> time<00:05:01.600> I<00:05:01.810> come<00:05:02.020> to

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
hopefully by the next time I come to

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.110 
hopefully by the next time I come to
create<00:05:02.440> a<00:05:02.470> guide<00:05:02.800> I<00:05:03.070> will<00:05:03.250> have<00:05:03.370> bothered<00:05:03.700> to

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
create a guide I will have bothered to

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.030 
create a guide I will have bothered to
figure<00:05:04.330> out<00:05:04.570> some<00:05:04.870> sort<00:05:05.050> of<00:05:05.200> screen<00:05:05.620> capture

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
figure out some sort of screen capture

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.230 
figure out some sort of screen capture
software<00:05:06.190> so<00:05:06.580> I<00:05:06.610> would<00:05:06.790> be<00:05:06.880> doing<00:05:07.000> with<00:05:07.120> a

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
software so I would be doing with a

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.560 
software so I would be doing with a
video<00:05:07.480> camera<00:05:07.540> I<00:05:08.410> guess<00:05:08.950> that<00:05:09.190> shows<00:05:09.450> just<00:05:10.450> how

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
video camera I guess that shows just how

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.260 
video camera I guess that shows just how
technical<00:05:11.170> I<00:05:11.320> potentially<00:05:12.130> am<00:05:12.310> not<00:05:12.580> and<00:05:12.850> I've

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
technical I potentially am not and I've

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.580 
technical I potentially am not and I've
managed<00:05:13.600> to<00:05:13.660> achieve<00:05:13.750> all<00:05:14.110> of<00:05:14.230> these<00:05:14.350> things

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
managed to achieve all of these things

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.100 
managed to achieve all of these things
fairly<00:05:14.980> easily<00:05:15.570> and<00:05:16.570> that's<00:05:16.750> it<00:05:16.930> that

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
fairly easily and that's it that

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.070 
fairly easily and that's it that
concludes<00:05:17.500> my<00:05:17.890> demonstration
