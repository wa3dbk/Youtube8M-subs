00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.470 
else it really muffles the sound amount
of<00:03:21.350> what<00:03:21.560> you<00:03:21.710> do<00:03:21.890> and<00:03:22.670> that's<00:03:22.820> why<00:03:23.000> I<00:03:23.120> like

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
of what you do and that's why I like

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.940 
of what you do and that's why I like
having<00:03:23.780> my<00:03:24.020> speakers<00:03:24.410> in<00:03:24.560> my<00:03:24.620> hand<00:03:24.800> when<00:03:24.890> I

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
having my speakers in my hand when I

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.370 
having my speakers in my hand when I
used<00:03:25.100> to<00:03:25.250> have<00:03:25.400> a<00:03:25.630> handlebar<00:03:26.630> mounted<00:03:27.050> speaker

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
used to have a handlebar mounted speaker

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.640 
used to have a handlebar mounted speaker
system<00:03:27.770> and<00:03:28.840> I<00:03:29.840> just<00:03:30.020> didn't<00:03:30.200> like<00:03:30.320> as<00:03:30.470> much<00:03:30.590> as

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
system and I just didn't like as much as

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.350 
system and I just didn't like as much as
having<00:03:31.070> everything<00:03:31.670> inside<00:03:32.060> my<00:03:32.180> helmet

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
having everything inside my helmet

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.120 
having everything inside my helmet
because<00:03:33.200> it<00:03:33.350> just<00:03:33.560> sounds<00:03:33.800> a<00:03:33.830> little<00:03:33.920> better

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
because it just sounds a little better

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.470 
because it just sounds a little better
because<00:03:34.460> you're<00:03:34.580> getting<00:03:34.640> less<00:03:34.880> wind<00:03:35.180> on<00:03:35.360> the

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
because you're getting less wind on the

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
use the 3/4 helmet or a half helmet you

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.480 
use the 3/4 helmet or a half helmet you
can<00:05:10.970> probably<00:05:11.210> still<00:05:11.480> hear<00:05:11.540> the<00:05:11.780> music<00:05:12.490> so

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
it's definitely very good I actually get

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.650 
it's definitely very good I actually get
a<00:05:16.580> little<00:05:16.730> bit<00:05:16.820> louder<00:05:16.970> than<00:05:17.180> the<00:05:17.330> Taylor

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:11.950 
ten reliability that I bump it up maybe

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.130 
ten reliability that I bump it up maybe
to<00:06:12.100> a<00:06:12.130> seven<00:06:12.490> out<00:06:12.580> of<00:06:12.640> ten<00:06:12.700> because<00:06:13.030> it<00:06:13.390> seems

for<00:06:15.940> a<00:06:16.000> year<00:06:16.300> was<00:06:16.900> super<00:06:17.170> reliable<00:06:17.410> the<00:06:17.650> only

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:18.040 
for a year was super reliable the only

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.740 
for a year was super reliable the only
reason<00:06:18.400> I<00:06:18.490> got<00:06:18.640> rich<00:06:18.880> by<00:06:18.910> having<00:06:19.390> got<00:06:19.570> rid<00:06:19.720> of

it

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:21.670 
it

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.310 
it
what's<00:06:22.120> because<00:06:22.390> sharks<00:06:22.630> Tempe<00:06:22.900> this<00:06:23.020> one<00:06:23.200> to

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
what's because sharks Tempe this one to

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.260 
what's because sharks Tempe this one to
review<00:06:23.620> and<00:06:23.860> it<00:06:24.340> performs<00:06:24.790> just<00:06:24.910> a<00:06:24.970> little<00:06:25.150> bit

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
review and it performs just a little bit
