all<00:00:14.780> right<00:00:14.930> so<00:00:15.110> we've<00:00:15.260> got<00:00:15.290> got<00:00:16.160> our<00:00:16.250> mics

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
all right so we've got got our mics

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.460 
all right so we've got got our mics
placed<00:00:16.760> I<00:00:17.090> got<00:00:17.510> a<00:00:17.540> drummer<00:00:17.810> in<00:00:17.870> there<00:00:18.110> now<00:00:18.230> he's

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
placed I got a drummer in there now he's

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.420 
placed I got a drummer in there now he's
going<00:00:18.590> to<00:00:18.650> hit<00:00:18.830> on<00:00:18.950> it<00:00:19.070> and<00:00:19.540> we're<00:00:20.540> just<00:00:20.600> gonna

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.430 
going to hit on it and we're just gonna

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.530 
going to hit on it and we're just gonna
turn<00:00:22.430> up<00:00:22.580> the<00:00:22.670> preamp<00:00:22.970> a<00:00:23.060> little<00:00:23.240> bit<00:00:23.330> get<00:00:23.510> some

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:23.540 
turn up the preamp a little bit get some

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.330 
turn up the preamp a little bit get some
signal<00:00:24.020> on<00:00:24.140> it<00:00:24.260> and<00:00:24.380> then<00:00:24.740> we'll<00:00:24.920> try<00:00:25.070> to<00:00:25.130> fix

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
signal on it and then we'll try to fix

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.340 
signal on it and then we'll try to fix
the<00:00:25.490> tone<00:00:25.700> do<00:00:26.390> a<00:00:26.420> little<00:00:26.570> bitty<00:00:26.779> cueing<00:00:27.170> and<00:00:27.200> a

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:27.350 
the tone do a little bitty cueing and a

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.350 
the tone do a little bitty cueing and a
little<00:00:27.500> bit<00:00:27.590> of<00:00:27.650> compression<00:00:28.180> first<00:00:29.180> thing

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360 
little bit of compression first thing

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.480 
little bit of compression first thing
I'm<00:00:29.450> going<00:00:29.540> to<00:00:29.599> do<00:00:29.750> is<00:00:29.930> check<00:00:30.169> my<00:00:30.349> gain<00:00:30.980> staging

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
I'm going to do is check my gain staging

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.600 
I'm going to do is check my gain staging
and<00:00:31.669> get<00:00:32.570> a<00:00:32.599> solid<00:00:32.840> signal<00:00:33.230> going<00:00:33.800> to<00:00:33.890> tape<00:00:36.610> so

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
and get a solid signal going to tape so

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.860 
and get a solid signal going to tape so
I'm<00:00:37.700> watching<00:00:38.000> my<00:00:38.090> meter<00:00:38.300> here<00:00:38.540> I've<00:00:38.690> got<00:00:38.840> my

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
I'm watching my meter here I've got my

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.270 
I'm watching my meter here I've got my
compressor<00:00:39.380> bypassed<00:00:39.800> so<00:00:39.980> it's<00:00:40.130> not

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
compressor bypassed so it's not

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.670 
compressor bypassed so it's not
affecting<00:00:40.640> my<00:00:40.760> signal<00:00:41.090> at<00:00:41.180> all<00:00:41.270> all<00:00:42.230> right<00:00:42.410> so

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
affecting my signal at all all right so

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.260 
affecting my signal at all all right so
I'm<00:00:42.770> going<00:00:42.920> to<00:00:42.950> start<00:00:43.310> with<00:00:43.370> my<00:00:43.489> EQ<00:00:43.789> bypassed

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
I'm going to start with my EQ bypassed

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.860 
I'm going to start with my EQ bypassed
and<00:00:46.149> basically<00:00:47.149> do<00:00:47.329> a<00:00:47.359> couple<00:00:47.690> of<00:00:47.719> the<00:00:47.840> things

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
and basically do a couple of the things

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.560 
and basically do a couple of the things
that<00:00:48.230> I<00:00:48.260> normally<00:00:48.379> do<00:00:48.800> which<00:00:49.010> is<00:00:49.390> I'm<00:00:50.390> going<00:00:50.510> to

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
that I normally do which is I'm going to

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.900 
that I normally do which is I'm going to
scoop<00:00:50.750> out<00:00:50.930> some<00:00:50.960> of<00:00:51.230> the<00:00:51.289> low<00:00:51.440> mids<00:00:51.710> and<00:00:51.920> boost

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
scoop out some of the low mids and boost

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.229 
scoop out some of the low mids and boost
up<00:00:53.090> some<00:00:53.300> of<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:53.449> highs<00:00:53.629> and<00:00:54.609> the<00:00:55.609> presents

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
up some of the highs and the presents

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.209 
up some of the highs and the presents
range<00:00:56.480> and<00:00:57.170> then<00:00:57.440> also<00:00:57.679> boost<00:00:57.859> up<00:00:58.039> a<00:00:58.100> little

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
range and then also boost up a little

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.419 
range and then also boost up a little
bit<00:00:58.370> of<00:00:58.429> low<00:00:58.640> frequency<00:00:59.179> stuff<00:01:00.250> so<00:01:01.250> I'm

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:01.429 
bit of low frequency stuff so I'm

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:03.970 
bit of low frequency stuff so I'm
starting<00:01:01.730> out<00:01:01.850> with<00:01:01.910> a<00:01:02.379> shelf<00:01:03.379> at<00:01:03.620> 8<00:01:03.739> K

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
starting out with a shelf at 8 K

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.410 
starting out with a shelf at 8 K
boosting<00:01:04.730> that<00:01:04.820> up<00:01:05.000> a<00:01:05.089> few<00:01:05.269> DB<00:01:05.830> and<00:01:06.830> then<00:01:07.310> a

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
boosting that up a few DB and then a

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.240 
boosting that up a few DB and then a
bump<00:01:08.420> right<00:01:08.570> around<00:01:08.810> 3k<00:01:09.350> this<00:01:09.830> could<00:01:10.040> vary

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
bump right around 3k this could vary

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.850 
bump right around 3k this could vary
anywhere<00:01:10.490> from<00:01:10.670> 1k<00:01:11.270> up<00:01:11.750> to<00:01:12.140> maybe<00:01:12.290> 5k

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
anywhere from 1k up to maybe 5k

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.590 
anywhere from 1k up to maybe 5k
depending<00:01:13.430> on<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.580> type<00:01:13.730> of<00:01:13.760> music<00:01:14.480> you're

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
depending on the type of music you're

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.620 
depending on the type of music you're
doing<00:01:15.310> and<00:01:16.310> then<00:01:16.400> right<00:01:16.579> around<00:01:16.670> 300<00:01:17.390> this

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
doing and then right around 300 this

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.350 
doing and then right around 300 this
this<00:01:17.990> EQ<00:01:18.320> stops<00:01:18.619> at<00:01:18.770> 250<00:01:19.310> so<00:01:20.060> I'm<00:01:20.150> going<00:01:20.299> to

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
this EQ stops at 250 so I'm going to

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.969 
this EQ stops at 250 so I'm going to
drop<00:01:20.509> that<00:01:20.689> down<00:01:20.869> quite<00:01:21.170> a<00:01:21.200> bit<00:01:21.290> you<00:01:21.619> can<00:01:21.770> scoop

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
drop that down quite a bit you can scoop

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.280 
drop that down quite a bit you can scoop
out<00:01:22.100> a<00:01:22.159> lot<00:01:22.400> of<00:01:22.430> that<00:01:22.610> and<00:01:23.079> makes<00:01:24.079> a<00:01:24.140> big

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
out a lot of that and makes a big

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.889 
out a lot of that and makes a big
difference<00:01:24.650> and<00:01:25.360> then<00:01:26.360> I've<00:01:26.450> got<00:01:26.540> a<00:01:26.570> bump<00:01:26.780> at

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
difference and then I've got a bump at

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.080 
difference and then I've got a bump at
80<00:01:27.079> Hertz<00:01:27.340> so<00:01:28.340> I'm<00:01:28.399> going<00:01:28.520> to<00:01:28.579> try<00:01:28.700> that<00:01:28.729> by

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
80 Hertz so I'm going to try that by

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.389 
80 Hertz so I'm going to try that by
unbias<00:01:29.869> it<00:01:30.110> and<00:01:30.259> see<00:01:30.530> how<00:01:30.619> it<00:01:30.710> goes<00:01:30.890> see<00:01:31.280> if<00:01:31.340> I

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
unbias it and see how it goes see if I

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:43.120 
unbias it and see how it goes see if I
like<00:01:31.579> it<00:01:41.350> alright<00:01:42.350> it's<00:01:42.500> definitely<00:01:42.979> a<00:01:43.009> good

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
like it alright it's definitely a good

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.120 
like it alright it's definitely a good
enough<00:01:43.280> to<00:01:43.399> start<00:01:43.640> starting<00:01:44.210> point<00:01:44.950> with<00:01:45.950> my

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
enough to start starting point with my

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.649 
enough to start starting point with my
EQ<00:01:46.430> I've<00:01:46.610> boosted<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:47.090> level<00:01:47.360> a<00:01:47.390> little<00:01:47.479> bit

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
EQ I've boosted the level a little bit

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.830 
EQ I've boosted the level a little bit
so<00:01:47.780> I'm<00:01:47.840> going<00:01:47.869> to<00:01:48.020> trim<00:01:48.229> it<00:01:48.259> back<00:01:48.500> some<00:01:48.799> I

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
so I'm going to trim it back some I

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.270 
so I'm going to trim it back some I
usually<00:01:50.840> compress<00:01:51.579> not<00:01:52.579> a<00:01:52.610> real<00:01:52.820> strong<00:01:53.030> ratio

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
usually compress not a real strong ratio

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.260 
usually compress not a real strong ratio
I'm<00:01:55.280> going<00:01:55.460> to<00:01:55.520> try<00:01:55.670> it<00:01:55.729> start<00:01:56.000> it<00:01:56.060> out<00:01:56.119> about

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
I'm going to try it start it out about

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.950 
I'm going to try it start it out about
three<00:01:56.479> two<00:01:56.570> one

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
three two one

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.600 
three two one
I<00:01:57.009> leave<00:01:58.009> a<00:01:59.530> fairly<00:02:00.530> you<00:02:01.070> know<00:02:01.189> relatively

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
I leave a fairly you know relatively

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.039 
I leave a fairly you know relatively
slow<00:02:01.850> attack<00:02:02.090> enough<00:02:02.420> definitely<00:02:02.869> enough<00:02:03.020> to

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
slow attack enough definitely enough to

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.249 
slow attack enough definitely enough to
let<00:02:03.289> the<00:02:03.439> transient<00:02:03.979> through<00:02:04.189> so<00:02:05.259> generally

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
let the transient through so generally

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.350 
let the transient through so generally
no<00:02:06.380> less<00:02:06.590> than<00:02:06.740> 10<00:02:06.950> milliseconds<00:02:07.640> especially

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
no less than 10 milliseconds especially

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.550 
no less than 10 milliseconds especially

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
when I'm tracking because I don't want

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.520 
when I'm tracking because I don't want
to<00:02:09.649> screw<00:02:10.070> anything<00:02:10.130> up<00:02:10.580> and<00:02:11.140> then<00:02:12.140> just<00:02:12.440> to

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
to screw anything up and then just to

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.880 
to screw anything up and then just to
slow<00:02:12.740> enough<00:02:12.920> release<00:02:13.250> that<00:02:13.520> it's<00:02:13.640> going<00:02:13.760> to

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
slow enough release that it's going to

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.590 
slow enough release that it's going to
kind<00:02:15.890> of<00:02:15.980> slowly<00:02:16.220> pull<00:02:16.580> back<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.390> point

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
kind of slowly pull back to the point

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.809 
kind of slowly pull back to the point
where<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.810> next<00:02:18.020> hit<00:02:18.170> hits<00:02:18.550> and<00:02:19.550> that<00:02:19.640> can

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
where the next hit hits and that can

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.810 
where the next hit hits and that can
vary<00:02:20.030> depending<00:02:20.209> on<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.599> tempo<00:02:20.870> of<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.050> song

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.920 

all<00:02:24.820> right<00:02:24.970> so<00:02:25.120> I<00:02:25.150> got<00:02:25.300> it<00:02:25.360> set<00:02:25.540> now<00:02:25.690> I'm<00:02:25.810> going

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
all right so I got it set now I'm going

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.410 
all right so I got it set now I'm going
to<00:02:26.020> take<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.590> bypass<00:02:26.770> off<00:02:27.250> and<00:02:27.490> see<00:02:28.210> what<00:02:28.330> it

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
to take the bypass off and see what it

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.990 
to take the bypass off and see what it
does<00:02:32.190> sometimes<00:02:33.190> I<00:02:33.430> like<00:02:33.580> to<00:02:33.610> push<00:02:33.820> it<00:02:33.850> a

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
does sometimes I like to push it a

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.400 
does sometimes I like to push it a
little<00:02:34.180> hard<00:02:34.360> just<00:02:34.570> to<00:02:34.690> see<00:02:34.870> what<00:02:35.290> it's

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
little hard just to see what it's

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.600 
little hard just to see what it's
actually<00:02:35.470> doing<00:02:37.140> make<00:02:38.140> sure<00:02:38.320> I'm<00:02:38.470> not<00:02:38.680> doing

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
actually doing make sure I'm not doing

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.100 
actually doing make sure I'm not doing
anything<00:02:39.850> too<00:02:40.090> bad<00:02:40.240> and<00:02:40.720> then<00:02:40.810> I'll<00:02:40.900> back<00:02:41.050> it

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
anything too bad and then I'll back it

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.320 
anything too bad and then I'll back it
up<00:02:41.350> so<00:02:41.530> it's<00:02:41.680> just<00:02:41.830> barely<00:02:42.070> barely<00:02:42.910> giving<00:02:43.270> it

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
up so it's just barely barely giving it

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.130 
up so it's just barely barely giving it
a<00:02:43.360> little<00:02:43.480> more<00:02:43.630> punch<00:02:45.480> all<00:02:46.480> right<00:02:46.660> now<00:02:46.930> I<00:02:46.960> got

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
a little more punch all right now I got

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.320 
a little more punch all right now I got
to<00:02:47.170> check<00:02:47.350> my<00:02:47.410> gain<00:02:47.770> because<00:02:48.730> I'm<00:02:48.880> losing<00:02:49.090> a

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
to check my gain because I'm losing a

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.670 
to check my gain because I'm losing a
little<00:02:49.510> volume<00:02:49.690> with<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:49.990> compressor<00:02:50.440> so<00:02:50.470> I'm

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
little volume with the compressor so I'm

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.350 
little volume with the compressor so I'm
going<00:02:50.800> to<00:02:50.860> make<00:02:51.460> up<00:02:51.640> for<00:02:51.820> that<00:02:51.850> a<00:02:51.970> little<00:02:52.150> bit

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
going to make up for that a little bit

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.210 
going to make up for that a little bit
with<00:02:52.840> my<00:02:52.960> output<00:02:53.320> gain<00:02:53.500> here<00:02:55.890> all<00:02:56.890> right<00:02:57.040> so

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
with my output gain here all right so

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.780 
with my output gain here all right so
that's<00:02:57.310> a<00:02:57.430> decent<00:02:57.580> signal<00:02:58.060> on<00:02:58.180> kick<00:02:58.420> in<00:02:59.490> so<00:03:00.490> I'm

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
that's a decent signal on kick in so I'm

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.610 
that's a decent signal on kick in so I'm
going<00:03:00.940> to<00:03:01.000> take<00:03:01.210> that<00:03:01.360> now<00:03:01.570> and<00:03:01.870> work<00:03:02.350> on<00:03:02.470> my

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
going to take that now and work on my

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.310 
going to take that now and work on my
out<00:03:02.800> mic<00:03:03.040> that's<00:03:03.280> sub<00:03:03.520> kick<00:03:04.020> that<00:03:05.020> one's<00:03:05.170> on<00:03:05.290> a

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
out mic that's sub kick that one's on a

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.460 
out mic that's sub kick that one's on a
console<00:03:05.740> preamp<00:03:06.690> here<00:03:07.690> we<00:03:07.750> go<00:03:10.290> got<00:03:11.290> a<00:03:11.320> good

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
console preamp here we go got a good

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.570 
console preamp here we go got a good
signal<00:03:11.710> and<00:03:11.980> I'm<00:03:12.040> going<00:03:12.160> to<00:03:12.190> put<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:12.340> little<00:03:12.490> bit

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
signal and I'm going to put a little bit

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.980 
signal and I'm going to put a little bit
of<00:03:12.640> EQ<00:03:12.730> on<00:03:13.000> I'm<00:03:13.450> going<00:03:13.570> to<00:03:13.630> do<00:03:13.690> something

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
of EQ on I'm going to do something

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.510 
of EQ on I'm going to do something
similar<00:03:14.200> scoop<00:03:14.590> up<00:03:14.740> the<00:03:14.860> low<00:03:14.980> mids<00:03:15.190> a<00:03:15.310> little

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
similar scoop up the low mids a little

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.190 
similar scoop up the low mids a little
bit<00:03:15.640> maybe<00:03:16.000> not<00:03:16.180> quite<00:03:16.330> as<00:03:16.510> much<00:03:16.660> in<00:03:16.720> this<00:03:16.990> case

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
bit maybe not quite as much in this case

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.820 
bit maybe not quite as much in this case
and<00:03:17.470> then<00:03:19.350> possibly<00:03:20.350> give<00:03:20.470> it<00:03:20.560> a<00:03:20.590> little<00:03:20.680> bit

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
and then possibly give it a little bit

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.120 
and then possibly give it a little bit
of<00:03:20.890> a<00:03:20.920> low-end<00:03:21.280> bump<00:03:21.550> and<00:03:22.770> give<00:03:23.770> it<00:03:23.890> some<00:03:24.010> of

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
of a low-end bump and give it some of

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.610 
of a low-end bump and give it some of
this<00:03:24.220> 1k<00:03:24.760> stuff<00:03:25.600> for<00:03:25.870> for<00:03:26.200> a<00:03:26.230> little<00:03:26.380> bit<00:03:26.470> more

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
this 1k stuff for for a little bit more

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.680 
this 1k stuff for for a little bit more
attack<00:03:26.920> off<00:03:27.160> of<00:03:27.310> it<00:03:27.430> but<00:03:28.360> you're<00:03:28.450> not<00:03:28.510> going<00:03:28.660> to

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
attack off of it but you're not going to

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.080 
attack off of it but you're not going to
get<00:03:28.840> much<00:03:29.040> much<00:03:30.040> high<00:03:30.250> frequency<00:03:30.760> off<00:03:30.850> of<00:03:30.970> this

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
get much much high frequency off of this

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.560 
get much much high frequency off of this
mic<00:03:31.890> and<00:03:32.890> I'll<00:03:33.400> kick<00:03:33.580> that<00:03:33.760> EQ<00:03:34.120> in<00:03:36.420> don't<00:03:37.420> need

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
mic and I'll kick that EQ in don't need

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.820 
mic and I'll kick that EQ in don't need
to<00:03:37.660> do<00:03:37.750> too<00:03:37.959> much<00:03:38.110> to<00:03:38.320> this<00:03:38.440> because<00:03:38.620> it's

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
to do too much to this because it's

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.229 
to do too much to this because it's
already<00:03:39.130> kind<00:03:39.310> of<00:03:39.370> tailored<00:03:39.730> to<00:03:39.850> the<00:03:39.970> sound<00:03:40.180> we

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
already kind of tailored to the sound we

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.270 
already kind of tailored to the sound we
want<00:03:40.480> and<00:03:40.780> then<00:03:41.650> I'm<00:03:41.770> going<00:03:42.040> through<00:03:42.160> this

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
want and then I'm going through this

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.620 
want and then I'm going through this
compressor<00:03:42.790> which<00:03:42.940> is<00:03:43.060> a<00:03:43.090> transient<00:03:43.480> designer

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
compressor which is a transient designer

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.410 
compressor which is a transient designer
it's<00:03:44.230> a<00:03:44.290> really<00:03:44.530> unusual<00:03:45.180> compressor<00:03:46.180> and

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
it's a really unusual compressor and

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.560 
it's a really unusual compressor and
that<00:03:47.080> it<00:03:47.230> doesn't<00:03:47.410> really<00:03:48.270> doesn't<00:03:49.270> compress

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
that it doesn't really doesn't compress

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.300 
that it doesn't really doesn't compress
the<00:03:49.750> way<00:03:49.870> most<00:03:50.110> do<00:03:50.410> it<00:03:50.590> kind<00:03:50.800> of<00:03:50.860> splits<00:03:51.040> the

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
the way most do it kind of splits the

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.940 
the way most do it kind of splits the
sound<00:03:51.489> up<00:03:51.670> into<00:03:51.850> to<00:03:52.030> two<00:03:52.840> times<00:03:53.170> and<00:03:53.650> get<00:03:53.860> the

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
sound up into to two times and get the

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.370 
sound up into to two times and get the
attack<00:03:54.250> and<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.520> sustain<00:03:54.959> so<00:03:55.959> what<00:03:56.110> I<00:03:56.140> want

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
attack and the sustain so what I want

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.660 
attack and the sustain so what I want
out<00:03:56.500> of<00:03:56.530> this<00:03:56.680> is<00:03:56.739> a<00:03:56.890> little<00:03:57.130> bit<00:03:57.220> more<00:03:57.340> attack

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
out of this is a little bit more attack

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.350 
out of this is a little bit more attack
and<00:03:58.000> a<00:03:58.360> lot<00:03:58.540> less<00:03:58.690> sustain<00:03:59.230> and<00:04:00.150> this<00:04:01.150> give<00:04:01.330> us

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
and a lot less sustain and this give us
