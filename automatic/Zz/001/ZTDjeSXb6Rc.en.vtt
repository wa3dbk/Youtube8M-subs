00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.433
- You're turning 30
soon?

00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:02.466
- Yeah.
- When?

00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.066
- Um, I'm turning 30
in August.

00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:07.000
I feel thir--, like, I,
when I turned 29, I felt,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.400
- like, that's 30.
- You were already 30?

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.733
- I've bee saying I'm 30
for, like, a whole year now.

00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.300
- You just jumped ahead?
- Yeah.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.133
Um, so I'm, like, trying to,
'cause I'm 30 now,

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:18.066
or almost 30 or whatever,
um, I've been trying to, like,

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:21.566
be more healthy, and,
ugh, it's the worst.

00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:22.933
- It's awful.
- Is it?

00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:25.366
- It's the worst.
And the worst part is,

00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.333
I feel so much better.

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:30.433
Like, that's the worst part
is that, like, it works, and--

00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:32.366
- Uh-huh.
Wait, is this new to you?

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.466
Had you not been healthy
up until recently?

00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:37.066
- No. No.
- Do you work out?

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:40.366
- I mean, I'm trying now to,
you know, work out

00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.966
and eat some vegetables,
and, like,

00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.433
it's awful.
I hate it.

00:00:44.433 --> 00:00:46.000
- Well...
- But I feel like, "Oh,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.200
this is how
healthy people feel," you know?

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.000
- Right.
- Right. I get the appeal.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.400
- It actually works.
- But I was really hoping

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.766
that I would just do it
as an experiment,

00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.466
and I would feel
exactly the same.

00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.700
- Yep.
- And I could just go back

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.100
to eating Taco Bell
whenever I wanted.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.833
- And yet, no.
What kind of working out

00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:00.066
are you doing?

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:02.066
- I'm just doing, like,
I don't know.

00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:04.133
It's, like, you know,
everything's all fusiony

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.800
and, like, it's--it's, like,
you know,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.200
it's, like, is it pilates,
is it yoga,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.533
is it, you know, it's new
and sexy.

00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:12.766
- Yes. That's why I'm asking.

00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:15.600
- I'm just walking
vigorously.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.800
- I saw you walk out here.
It was really good, yeah.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.200
You must have burned, like,
I don't know,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.866
a calorie or something
like that.

00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:22.100
- Yeah. Felt like it.
- Well, good for you.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.533
Yeah. Good for you
for trying.

00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:28.033
And, uh, so "Pitch Perfect,"
the billboards are everywhere.

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:30.233
- Yeah. It's so weird.
- Is that weird when

00:01:30.233 --> 00:01:31.600
driving and you see yourself?

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.166
- I just finished a film
in Georgia,

00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:37.433
and, you know, felt like
nothing was really going on,

00:01:37.433 --> 00:01:39.933
and, yeah, Oh, my God.'
I, uh, I got back to L.A.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.800
a week ago, and I, like,
I felt like, "Oh, my God.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.533
I can't leave the house.
This is so embarrassing."

00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:46.500
I look a mess all the time,
and, like,

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.133
my face is on the side
of buildings and stuff.

00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:51.100
I've been, like, driving around
in my car, like this.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.233
I'm amazed I haven't
crashed into somebody.

00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:54.533
- That's really--I know.
That's fun.

00:01:54.533 --> 00:01:56.900
- It's exciting.
- Of course it is.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.333
- But it's a little embarrassing
'cause every time I'm, like,

00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:02.733
near one of them, I feel
like someone's gonna think

00:02:02.733 --> 00:02:04.766
that I'm just hanging out
near one, like,

00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:09.133
just, like, "Hey, is that--
Oh, who's that beautiful girl?"

00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:10.800
- Yeah.
- Am I right?

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.000
- Unless you're actually
standing next to it,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.400
I don't think
anybody's thinking that.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.166
You could just be in your car,
nobody's thinking,

00:02:17.166 --> 00:02:20.600
"Well, she's just driving
in this neighborhood."

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.633
And everyone's starting to,
from what I've seen, copy,

00:02:23.633 --> 00:02:25.300
I don't know why,
'cause it's just a pose,

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.000
but you have your arms crossed,
and you have,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.300
and people are actually now--

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.066
- This makes me so happy.

00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:33.533
Yeah, these, uh, a couple of
people sent me photos

00:02:33.533 --> 00:02:34.833
of, uh, themselves doing this.

00:02:34.833 --> 00:02:36.766
Yeah, it just got crazier
and crazier,

00:02:36.766 --> 00:02:40.000
and, um, and it was great
for me because, um,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.433
you know, the--when we shot
the poster, you know,

00:02:43.433 --> 00:02:46.666
um, the studio kind of wanted
me to pose a little, like,

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:49.733
sexier, and I, you know, that's
just not who this character is,

00:02:49.733 --> 00:02:51.933
and I don't think that's what,
you know, girls have to be.

00:02:51.933 --> 00:02:53.266
And so this is just me,
like,

00:02:53.266 --> 00:02:55.900
warmed my tiny little heart
so much.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.766
Um, and I love the, like,
the--the father and son there,

00:02:58.766 --> 00:03:00.833
like, oh, it's just--
it's so adorable.

00:03:00.833 --> 00:03:02.500
- It's sweet.
- It makes me really happy.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.700
- There's nothing wrong
with that.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.200
I mean, usually body language
like that

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.366
means you're closed off,
but it's just--you're just--

00:03:07.366 --> 00:03:09.033
- Yeah, it just, you know,
it's like you're, you know,

00:03:09.033 --> 00:03:10.400
- you're powerful.
- Right.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.000
- You're just--
- Yeah.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.433
I think we should do the rest
of the interview like this

00:03:14.433 --> 00:03:15.900
- together.
- Fine. Fine.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.900
- I don't know why we wouldn't.
- I don't even care.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.133
- Yeah.

00:03:18.133 --> 00:03:19.266
I don't care either.

00:03:19.266 --> 00:03:22.333
And so you posted
a picture of yourself--

00:03:22.333 --> 00:03:25.133
I like this very much, of you
wearing a onesie after the--

00:03:25.133 --> 00:03:27.166
you just got--got home and got
comfortable, didn't you?

00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:29.966
- I sure did.
Yeah, after the premiere.

00:03:29.966 --> 00:03:31.966
I got in my own onesie.

00:03:31.966 --> 00:03:34.366
Yeah, I posted that photo, um,
'cause I always think

00:03:34.366 --> 00:03:36.200
that's the best part of the
night is when you get home

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.433
and get comfortable.

00:03:37.433 --> 00:03:40.333
And that thing, I mean,
I would wear that--

00:03:40.333 --> 00:03:41.666
the next time I come on the
show,

00:03:41.666 --> 00:03:43.266
I swear I'll wear that
if you let me.

00:03:43.266 --> 00:03:44.533
If it's not weird.

00:03:44.533 --> 00:03:45.766
It's saved my life
so many times.

00:03:45.766 --> 00:03:48.666
You guys gave it to me
when you visited the set

00:03:48.666 --> 00:03:50.533
- of "Pitch Perfect 2."
- Isn't it so comfortable?

00:03:50.533 --> 00:03:52.333
- It is incredible.
- I'm so glad.

00:03:52.333 --> 00:03:53.700
Well, thank you
for posting that.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.400
- Can I get, like, a cut of the
sales of these now, or...?

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.833
I mean, that's not what this
was about,

00:03:58.833 --> 00:04:01.133
- but I'm thinking about it.
- No, you can't.

00:04:01.133 --> 00:04:02.500
- Okay.
