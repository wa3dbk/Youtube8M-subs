daylight<00:00:13.980> I'm<00:00:14.219> here<00:00:14.549> oh<00:00:14.700> we<00:00:15.089> planted<00:00:15.450> just<00:00:15.480> a

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
daylight I'm here oh we planted just a

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.060 
daylight I'm here oh we planted just a
little<00:00:16.020> patch<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:16.590> was<00:00:16.710> just<00:00:16.949> an

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
little patch and it was just an

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.400 
little patch and it was just an
experiment<00:00:17.490> in<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.600> it's<00:00:18.840> progressed

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
experiment in it and it's progressed

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.859 
experiment in it and it's progressed
over<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.890> years<00:00:20.189> up<00:00:20.670> until<00:00:20.820> now<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.270> think<00:00:21.630> that

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
over the years up until now I think that

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.310 
over the years up until now I think that
this<00:00:22.199> entails<00:00:22.619> about<00:00:23.100> nine<00:00:23.550> acres<00:00:24.029> of

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
this entails about nine acres of

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.900 
this entails about nine acres of
sunflowers<00:00:25.320> we<00:00:25.470> stagger<00:00:25.890> plant<00:00:26.189> these<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.699> so

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
sunflowers we stagger plant these and so

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.410 
sunflowers we stagger plant these and so
the<00:00:27.920> the<00:00:28.920> second<00:00:29.490> or<00:00:29.609> third<00:00:29.640> planting<00:00:30.210> back

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
the the second or third planting back

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.830 
the the second or third planting back
they're<00:00:31.019> gone<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.410> seed<00:00:31.880> you<00:00:32.880> look<00:00:33.120> at<00:00:33.329> the

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
they're gone to seed you look at the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.810 
they're gone to seed you look at the
butyl<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.500> it's<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.680> great<00:00:34.890> bird<00:00:35.160> sanctuary

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
butyl and it's a great bird sanctuary

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.030 
butyl and it's a great bird sanctuary
also<00:00:36.300> if<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.719> go<00:00:36.870> out<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.050> cut<00:00:37.440> heads<00:00:37.739> to

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
also if you go out to cut heads to

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.450 
also if you go out to cut heads to
either<00:00:38.700> sell<00:00:39.059> or<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.450> take<00:00:40.260> home<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:41.040> birds<00:00:41.280> of

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
either sell or to take home the birds of

either sell or to take home the birds of
litter<00:00:41.730> Eddie<00:00:41.969> annihilated<00:00:42.690> half<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.079> head

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
litter Eddie annihilated half the head

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.410 
litter Eddie annihilated half the head
because<00:00:43.770> they'll<00:00:44.340> eat<00:00:44.550> half<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:45.000> go<00:00:45.120> on<00:00:45.300> it's

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
because they'll eat half to go on it's

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.880 
because they'll eat half to go on it's
like<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.539> kid<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:45.989> candy<00:00:46.140> store<00:00:46.350> they<00:00:46.680> take

year this season was just a little

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.710 
year this season was just a little

last the last go-around that we did I

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.910 
last the last go-around that we did I
was<00:01:09.180> real<00:01:09.390> surprised<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.020> we<00:01:10.170> even<00:01:10.350> got<00:01:10.740> him
