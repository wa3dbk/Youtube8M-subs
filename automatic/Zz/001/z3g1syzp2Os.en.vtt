we<00:00:07.410> have<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:07.710> possible<00:00:08.400> bad<00:00:09.469> crankshaft

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:10.990 
we have a possible bad crankshaft

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.490 
we have a possible bad crankshaft
sensor<00:00:11.530> so<00:00:12.460> there's<00:00:13.240> some<00:00:13.660> videos<00:00:14.019> on<00:00:14.200> YouTube

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:14.500 
sensor so there's some videos on YouTube

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.259 
sensor so there's some videos on YouTube
about<00:00:14.590> this

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
about this

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.300 
about this
going<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.539> show<00:00:15.749> a<00:00:16.049> little<00:00:16.710> bit<00:00:16.830> of<00:00:16.949> how<00:00:17.130> I<00:00:17.160> did

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
going to show a little bit of how I did

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.859 
going to show a little bit of how I did
it<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:18.080> hopefully<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.230> helps<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:20.660> the<00:00:21.660> wire

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
it and hopefully that helps you the wire

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.069 
it and hopefully that helps you the wire
terminal<00:00:22.520> I've<00:00:23.520> already<00:00:23.820> actually<00:00:24.079> pulled

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:25.079 
terminal I've already actually pulled

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:30.170 
terminal I've already actually pulled
out<00:00:25.550> from<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.789> harness<00:00:27.169> now<00:00:28.169> but<00:00:28.849> just<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.000> see

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
out from the harness now but just to see

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.060 
out from the harness now but just to see
how<00:00:30.300> those<00:00:30.509> work<00:00:30.570> if<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.199> haven't<00:00:31.619> pulled

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
how those work if you haven't pulled

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.459 
how those work if you haven't pulled
those<00:00:32.250> apart<00:00:32.640> before<00:00:32.840> you<00:00:33.840> kind<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.170> have<00:00:34.290> to

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
those apart before you kind of have to

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.850 
those apart before you kind of have to
really<00:00:34.590> pull<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.010> thing<00:00:35.340> out<00:00:35.520> pry<00:00:35.879> it<00:00:35.940> with<00:00:36.180> a

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
really pull that thing out pry it with a

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.490 
really pull that thing out pry it with a
flathead<00:00:37.860> screwdriver<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.670> pull<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.000> out

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
flathead screwdriver to pull that out

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.470 
flathead screwdriver to pull that out
now<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.680> wire<00:00:40.920> one<00:00:41.460> when<00:00:41.850> it's<00:00:42.000> connected

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
now that wire one when it's connected

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.310 
now that wire one when it's connected
will<00:00:42.660> run<00:00:42.899> down<00:00:43.110> from<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.559> bottom<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:44.239> the

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
will run down from the bottom of the

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.190 
will run down from the bottom of the
harness<00:00:46.320> here<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:47.570> you'll<00:00:48.570> find<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.020> run

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
harness here and you'll find it run

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.590 
harness here and you'll find it run
along<00:00:49.440> here

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
along here

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.280 
along here
it<00:00:51.600> may<00:00:51.780> be<00:00:52.700> attached<00:00:53.700> by<00:00:53.970> a<00:00:54.000> bracket<00:00:54.930> down<00:00:55.110> in

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
it may be attached by a bracket down in

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.639 
it may be attached by a bracket down in
there

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
there

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.880 
there
I<00:00:55.680> just<00:00:56.610> kind<00:00:56.790> of<00:00:56.820> kicked<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.360> off<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:58.170> it'll

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
I just kind of kicked it off and it'll

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.530 
I just kind of kicked it off and it'll
run<00:00:59.010> down<00:00:59.220> through<00:00:59.520> here<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.790> the<00:00:59.880> front<00:01:00.180> up<00:01:00.390> in

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
run down through here to the front up in

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:08.569 
run down through here to the front up in
front<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.930> engine<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:03.439> right<00:01:04.439> down<00:01:07.579> below

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 
front of the engine and right down below

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:13.639 
front of the engine and right down below
the<00:01:08.880> oxygen<00:01:09.390> sensor<00:01:09.840> down<00:01:10.259> in<00:01:10.530> there<00:01:12.649> there's

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 
the oxygen sensor down in there there's

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:15.590 
the oxygen sensor down in there there's
already<00:01:13.860> videos<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.520> shows<00:01:14.759> you<00:01:14.969> could<00:01:15.119> see<00:01:15.299> a

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
already videos it shows you could see a

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.139 
already videos it shows you could see a
hole<00:01:16.020> there<00:01:16.350> actually<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.130> pulled<00:01:17.820> mine<00:01:18.000> out

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
hole there actually I pulled mine out

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:20.599 
hole there actually I pulled mine out
already<00:01:18.560> and<00:01:19.560> kind<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.859> see<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.159> hole<00:01:20.310> there

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:20.609 
already and kind of see the hole there

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:22.309 
already and kind of see the hole there
I'm<00:01:21.119> going<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.359> show<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.569> how<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.840> do<00:01:22.109> it<00:01:22.200> from

00:01:22.309 --> 00:01:22.319 
I'm going to show you how to do it from

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:24.739 
I'm going to show you how to do it from
underneath<00:01:22.649> the<00:01:22.950> car<00:01:23.270> because<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.389> just<00:01:24.569> found

00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:24.749 
underneath the car because I just found

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:26.569 
underneath the car because I just found
that<00:01:25.049> was<00:01:25.229> an<00:01:25.439> easier<00:01:26.009> way<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.159> go

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:26.579 
that was an easier way to go

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:29.779 
that was an easier way to go
which<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.569> why<00:01:27.749> my<00:01:27.990> car<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.319> up<00:01:28.409> on<00:01:28.560> ramps<00:01:28.859> there

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
which is why my car is up on ramps there

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:31.870 
which is why my car is up on ramps there
we<00:01:29.939> go<00:01:30.149> that's<00:01:30.840> under<00:01:31.109> the<00:01:31.200> car

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
we go that's under the car

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.300 
we go that's under the car
alright<00:01:33.319> cat<00:01:34.319> what's<00:01:34.499> over<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.889> coming<00:01:35.159> down

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
alright cat what's over to coming down

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.609 
alright cat what's over to coming down
and<00:01:37.039> that's<00:01:38.039> a<00:01:38.249> downstream<00:01:39.170> oxygen<00:01:40.170> sensor

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
and that's a downstream oxygen sensor

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.510 
and that's a downstream oxygen sensor
which<00:01:41.060> I<00:01:42.060> actually<00:01:43.049> have<00:01:43.319> loosened<00:01:43.859> because<00:01:44.429> I

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
which I actually have loosened because I

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.649 
which I actually have loosened because I
want<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.759> get<00:01:44.819> it<00:01:44.969> out<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.240> way<00:01:45.359> it's<00:01:45.630> a

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
want to get it out of the way it's a

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.690 
want to get it out of the way it's a
little<00:01:45.869> easier<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:47.189> work<00:01:47.399> on<00:01:48.359> the<00:01:48.749> cam<00:01:49.700> shaft

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
little easier to work on the cam shaft

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.449 
little easier to work on the cam shaft
position<00:01:51.270> sensor<00:01:51.719> if<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.259> get<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.889> oxygen

00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:53.459 
position sensor if you get that oxygen

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:57.679 
position sensor if you get that oxygen
sensor<00:01:54.299> just<00:01:54.599> gently<00:01:55.109> above<00:01:55.469> the<00:01:55.679> way<00:01:56.689> also

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
sensor just gently above the way also

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.989 
sensor just gently above the way also
maybe<00:01:58.409> not<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.649> bad<00:01:58.889> time<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.429> change<00:02:00.389> it<00:02:01.819> if<00:02:02.819> you

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:02.999 
maybe not a bad time to change it if you

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:06.129 
maybe not a bad time to change it if you
need<00:02:03.179> to<00:02:03.389> I<00:02:03.599> think<00:02:04.200> one<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.829> things<00:02:05.099> that

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:06.139 
need to I think one of the things that

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:09.169 
need to I think one of the things that
people<00:02:07.139> have<00:02:07.649> trouble<00:02:08.220> with<00:02:08.399> on<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:08.759> one<00:02:08.970> is

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
people have trouble with on this one is

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.860 
people have trouble with on this one is
getting<00:02:09.720> at<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:09.959> Torx<00:02:10.500> screw<00:02:11.300> this<00:02:12.300> holds<00:02:12.720> on

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
getting at that Torx screw this holds on

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.490 
getting at that Torx screw this holds on
the<00:02:13.170> screw<00:02:14.130> holds<00:02:14.370> onto<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:16.069> heat<00:02:17.069> shield<00:02:17.099> and

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
the screw holds onto the heat shield and

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.500 
the screw holds onto the heat shield and
also<00:02:19.500> holds<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.190> crankshaft<00:02:21.150> position

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
also holds the crankshaft position

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.350 
also holds the crankshaft position
sensor<00:02:21.810> in<00:02:22.290> place<00:02:22.319> that's<00:02:22.920> what<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:23.360> Torx

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
sensor in place that's what the Torx

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.120 
sensor in place that's what the Torx
bowl<00:02:24.570> like<00:02:25.050> that's<00:02:25.830> a

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
bowl like that's a

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
from a screwdriver sad or whatever you

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.750 
from a screwdriver sad or whatever you
need<00:02:34.270> your<00:02:34.540> your<00:02:35.080> a<00:02:35.110> bit<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:35.710> then<00:02:36.220> one<00:02:36.640> of

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
need your your a bit and then one of

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.520 
need your your a bit and then one of
these<00:02:37.500> bit<00:02:38.500> holders<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.330> then<00:02:40.330> for<00:02:40.900> mine<00:02:41.170> I

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
these bit holders and then for mine I

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.290 
these bit holders and then for mine I
just<00:02:41.830> use<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.010> quarter<00:02:42.600> box<00:02:43.600> and<00:02:43.930> wrench<00:02:44.200> and

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
just use a quarter box and wrench and

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.000 
just use a quarter box and wrench and
the<00:02:46.300> trick<00:02:46.540> is<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:46.780> get<00:02:47.110> it<00:02:47.260> on<00:02:47.350> that<00:02:47.590> screw

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
the trick is to get it on that screw

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.480 
the trick is to get it on that screw
it's<00:02:48.700> kind<00:02:49.060> of<00:02:49.180> a<00:02:50.170> little<00:02:50.800> tricky<00:02:51.100> to<00:02:51.130> get<00:02:51.340> it

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
it's kind of a little tricky to get it

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:52.770 
it's kind of a little tricky to get it
on<00:02:51.580> there<00:02:51.790> but<00:02:51.970> once<00:02:52.090> you<00:02:52.180> get<00:02:52.330> it<00:02:52.450> on<00:02:52.540> there

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
on there but once you get it on there

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.290 
on there but once you get it on there
you<00:02:52.990> can<00:02:53.530> just<00:02:53.650> put<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.190> wrench<00:02:54.340> on<00:02:54.640> like<00:02:55.060> this

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
you can just put the wrench on like this

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.800 
you can just put the wrench on like this
and<00:02:55.720> then<00:02:56.500> it's<00:02:56.950> actually<00:02:57.250> pretty<00:02:57.700> easy<00:02:57.810> from

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
and then it's actually pretty easy from

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.140 
and then it's actually pretty easy from
underneath<00:02:59.110> to<00:02:59.650> to<00:03:00.220> turn<00:03:00.520> it<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:00.820> might<00:03:00.970> have

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
underneath to to turn it you might have

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.310 
underneath to to turn it you might have
to<00:03:01.300> get<00:03:02.250> two<00:03:03.250> hands<00:03:03.640> on<00:03:03.760> it<00:03:03.790> too<00:03:04.660> to<00:03:04.990> keep<00:03:05.170> it

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
to get two hands on it too to keep it

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.340 
to get two hands on it too to keep it
stable<00:03:05.740> but<00:03:06.490> you<00:03:06.730> can<00:03:06.910> you<00:03:07.390> can<00:03:07.600> really<00:03:07.810> once

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
stable but you can you can really once

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.170 
stable but you can you can really once
you<00:03:08.410> get<00:03:08.590> that<00:03:08.740> on<00:03:08.920> there<00:03:09.100> you<00:03:09.670> can<00:03:09.850> turn<00:03:10.030> it

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
you get that on there you can turn it

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.970 
you get that on there you can turn it
pretty<00:03:10.390> easy<00:03:10.630> in<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:10.930> get<00:03:11.350> it<00:03:11.440> off<00:03:11.590> I<00:03:11.830> think

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
pretty easy in and get it off I think

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.910 
pretty easy in and get it off I think
the<00:03:12.220> easiest<00:03:12.490> ways<00:03:12.730> probably<00:03:13.170> feed<00:03:14.170> the

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
the easiest ways probably feed the

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.870 
the easiest ways probably feed the
sensor<00:03:15.670> and<00:03:15.910> down<00:03:16.600> through<00:03:17.050> at<00:03:17.770> least<00:03:17.880> you

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
sensor and down through at least you

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.800 
sensor and down through at least you
know<00:03:19.030> drop<00:03:19.900> it<00:03:20.080> down<00:03:20.200> through<00:03:20.530> partway<00:03:21.130> and

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
know drop it down through partway and

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.620 
know drop it down through partway and
get<00:03:22.810> it<00:03:22.930> down<00:03:23.080> in<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.380> vicinity<00:03:23.890> of<00:03:24.630> work

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
get it down in the vicinity of work

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.100 
get it down in the vicinity of work
where<00:03:26.620> it<00:03:26.710> attaches<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:27.850> so<00:03:28.510> that's<00:03:28.900> what<00:03:29.050> I

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
where it attaches and so that's what I

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.900 
where it attaches and so that's what I
did

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
did

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.850 
did
so<00:03:30.910> there's<00:03:31.210> the<00:03:31.390> new<00:03:31.540> sensor<00:03:31.960> I've<00:03:32.110> pushed<00:03:32.650> it

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
so there's the new sensor I've pushed it

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.700 
so there's the new sensor I've pushed it
in<00:03:33.040> place<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:34.540> want<00:03:34.720> to<00:03:34.780> kind<00:03:34.990> of<00:03:35.140> just<00:03:35.200> you

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
in place you want to kind of just you

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.350 
in place you want to kind of just you
know<00:03:35.770> obviously<00:03:36.340> make<00:03:36.520> sure<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:36.850> the

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
know obviously make sure the the

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.870 
know obviously make sure the the
plowshare<00:03:38.080> is<00:03:38.170> on<00:03:38.320> there<00:03:38.590> and<00:03:38.770> then<00:03:39.460> push<00:03:39.730> it

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
plowshare is on there and then push it

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.400 
plowshare is on there and then push it
in<00:03:40.000> and<00:03:40.150> get<00:03:40.300> it<00:03:40.330> to<00:03:40.540> seat<00:03:40.780> really<00:03:41.020> well<00:03:41.290> and

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
in and get it to seat really well and

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.810 
in and get it to seat really well and
then<00:03:41.560> line<00:03:42.310> up<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:42.990> where<00:03:43.990> the<00:03:44.140> Torx<00:03:44.640> bolt<00:03:45.640> is

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
then line up the where the Torx bolt is

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.660 
then line up the where the Torx bolt is
going<00:03:45.910> to<00:03:46.090> go<00:03:46.890> another<00:03:47.890> sort<00:03:48.250> of<00:03:48.310> little<00:03:48.490> trick

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
going to go another sort of little trick

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.920 
going to go another sort of little trick
I<00:03:48.790> like<00:03:48.940> to<00:03:49.000> use<00:03:49.150> some<00:03:49.540> anti-seize<00:03:51.750> you<00:03:52.750> could

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
I like to use some anti-seize you could

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.080 
I like to use some anti-seize you could
use<00:03:53.110> I<00:03:53.350> suppose<00:03:53.410> other<00:03:53.890> things<00:03:54.220> vaseline<00:03:54.880> or

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
use I suppose other things vaseline or

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.220 
use I suppose other things vaseline or
something<00:03:55.420> might<00:03:55.600> work<00:03:55.630> but<00:03:55.990> I<00:03:56.620> just<00:03:57.340> like<00:03:57.520> to

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
something might work but I just like to

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.510 
something might work but I just like to
put<00:03:59.230> a<00:03:59.290> little<00:03:59.380> bit<00:03:59.500> on<00:03:59.680> the<00:03:59.950> on<00:04:00.270> the<00:04:01.270> end<00:04:01.480> of

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
put a little bit on the on the end of

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.420 
put a little bit on the on the end of
the<00:04:03.520> torques<00:04:03.970> and<00:04:04.320> so<00:04:05.320> you<00:04:05.410> can<00:04:05.680> film<00:04:06.010> this<00:04:06.160> and

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
the torques and so you can film this and

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.000 
the torques and so you can film this and
do<00:04:07.150> this<00:04:07.330> at<00:04:07.480> the<00:04:07.600> same<00:04:07.630> time<00:04:09.390> okay<00:04:10.390> so<00:04:11.010> what

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
do this at the same time okay so what

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.000 
do this at the same time okay so what
that<00:04:12.040> does<00:04:12.340> is<00:04:12.550> just<00:04:12.580> hold<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:14.320> bolt<00:04:14.800> on

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
that does is just hold the the bolt on

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.920 
that does is just hold the the bolt on
there

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
there

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.370 
there
tallip<00:04:16.930> me<00:04:17.109> when<00:04:17.620> I<00:04:17.650> feed<00:04:18.010> it<00:04:18.040> up<00:04:18.280> through<00:04:18.310> and

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
tallip me when I feed it up through and

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.290 
tallip me when I feed it up through and
then<00:04:20.380> that<00:04:20.590> stuff<00:04:20.859> is<00:04:21.070> is<00:04:21.340> fine<00:04:21.790> it<00:04:21.970> will<00:04:22.060> just

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
then that stuff is is fine it will just

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.870 
then that stuff is is fine it will just
eventually<00:04:23.140> come<00:04:23.650> off<00:04:23.680> doesn't<00:04:24.520> cause<00:04:24.670> any

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
eventually come off doesn't cause any

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.990 
eventually come off doesn't cause any
problem<00:04:26.040> and<00:04:27.040> of<00:04:27.190> course<00:04:27.370> put<00:04:27.820> a<00:04:27.850> little

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
problem and of course put a little

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.590 
problem and of course put a little
anti-seize<00:04:28.480> on<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:29.080> bolt<00:04:29.800> itself<00:04:30.600> because

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
anti-seize on the bolt itself because

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.900 
anti-seize on the bolt itself because
you<00:04:32.050> may<00:04:32.200> be<00:04:32.230> taking<00:04:32.680> this<00:04:32.830> out<00:04:33.010> again<00:04:33.280> someday

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
you may be taking this out again someday

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.280 
you may be taking this out again someday
maybe<00:04:34.500> hopefully<00:04:35.580> not<00:04:36.580> too<00:04:36.760> soon<00:04:37.060> but<00:04:37.330> never

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
maybe hopefully not too soon but never

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.470 
maybe hopefully not too soon but never
know
