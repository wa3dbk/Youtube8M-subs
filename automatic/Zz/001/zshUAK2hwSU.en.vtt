about<00:00:27.369> is<00:00:27.609> golf<00:00:28.390> swing<00:00:28.689> speed<00:00:29.079> and<00:00:29.289> how<00:00:29.380> you

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
about is golf swing speed and how you

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.090 
about is golf swing speed and how you
can<00:00:29.680> improve<00:00:30.070> it<00:00:30.930> one<00:00:31.930> of<00:00:31.989> the<00:00:32.050> key<00:00:32.290> areas<00:00:32.590> in

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
can improve it one of the key areas in

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.660 
can improve it one of the key areas in
the<00:00:33.370> body<00:00:33.610> to<00:00:34.030> improve<00:00:34.360> golf<00:00:34.720> swing<00:00:34.960> speed<00:00:35.290> is

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
the body to improve golf swing speed is

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.280 
the body to improve golf swing speed is
your<00:00:36.670> hip<00:00:36.820> rotation<00:00:37.390> and<00:00:37.839> not<00:00:37.989> only<00:00:38.079> hip

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
your hip rotation and not only hip

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.590 
your hip rotation and not only hip
rotation<00:00:38.800> but<00:00:39.010> core<00:00:39.280> rotation<00:00:39.460> tied<00:00:40.059> in<00:00:40.300> so

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
rotation but core rotation tied in so

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.810 
rotation but core rotation tied in so
kind<00:00:41.050> of<00:00:41.170> middle<00:00:41.440> section<00:00:41.860> of<00:00:41.920> your<00:00:42.040> body<00:00:42.309> if

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
kind of middle section of your body if

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.110 
kind of middle section of your body if
you<00:00:43.030> can<00:00:43.210> get<00:00:43.360> that<00:00:43.540> moving<00:00:43.960> faster<00:00:44.920> in

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
you can get that moving faster in

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.270 
you can get that moving faster in
sequence<00:00:46.120> in<00:00:46.329> the<00:00:46.420> downswing<00:00:46.870> your<00:00:47.829> club<00:00:48.129> head

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
sequence in the downswing your club head

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.889 
sequence in the downswing your club head
speed<00:00:48.309> is<00:00:48.610> going<00:00:48.699> to<00:00:48.760> be<00:00:48.879> faster<00:00:49.300> resulting<00:00:49.780> in

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899 
speed is going to be faster resulting in

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:51.869 
speed is going to be faster resulting in
longer<00:00:50.320> drives<00:00:50.620> that's<00:00:51.250> if<00:00:51.489> you<00:00:51.610> hit<00:00:51.760> the

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
longer drives that's if you hit the

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:52.920 
longer drives that's if you hit the
middle<00:00:52.059> of<00:00:52.149> the<00:00:52.210> clubface<00:00:52.390> of<00:00:52.690> course

isn't<00:00:57.460> going<00:00:57.579> to<00:00:57.640> get<00:00:57.789> you<00:00:57.910> anywhere<00:00:58.180> but<00:00:58.780> what

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
isn't going to get you anywhere but what

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.569 
isn't going to get you anywhere but what
I<00:00:59.079> find<00:00:59.350> out<00:00:59.530> with<00:00:59.649> a<00:00:59.679> lot<00:00:59.949> of<00:00:59.980> golfers<00:01:00.370> that<00:01:00.519> I

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
I find out with a lot of golfers that I

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.900 
I find out with a lot of golfers that I
work<00:01:00.820> with<00:01:00.850> this<00:01:01.440> locked<00:01:02.440> up<00:01:02.679> in<00:01:02.920> mobility<00:01:03.280> in

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
work with this locked up in mobility in

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.969 
work with this locked up in mobility in
their<00:01:04.300> hip<00:01:04.479> area<00:01:04.809> so<00:01:04.989> if<00:01:05.379> you've<00:01:05.530> got<00:01:05.710> really

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
their hip area so if you've got really

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.400 
their hip area so if you've got really
tight<00:01:06.369> restricted<00:01:07.030> hips<00:01:07.300> it's<00:01:08.080> going<00:01:08.259> to<00:01:08.320> be

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
tight restricted hips it's going to be

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.320 
tight restricted hips it's going to be
very<00:01:08.649> difficult<00:01:08.979> to<00:01:09.280> fire<00:01:09.580> those<00:01:09.789> hips<00:01:10.060> in<00:01:10.210> the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
very difficult to fire those hips in the

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.419 
very difficult to fire those hips in the
downswing<00:01:10.960> and<00:01:11.200> create<00:01:11.890> that<00:01:12.070> club<00:01:12.280> head

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:12.429 
downswing and create that club head

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:13.620 
downswing and create that club head
speed<00:01:12.460> you're<00:01:12.789> looking<00:01:13.090> forward<00:01:13.330> to<00:01:13.479> get

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
speed you're looking forward to get

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.050 
speed you're looking forward to get
longer<00:01:14.619> drives<00:01:14.890> so<00:01:15.429> what<00:01:15.580> I<00:01:15.610> want<00:01:15.789> to<00:01:15.820> show<00:01:16.000> you

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
longer drives so what I want to show you

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.270 
longer drives so what I want to show you
two<00:01:16.300> is<00:01:16.479> a<00:01:16.509> simple<00:01:17.110> goal<00:01:17.380> stretch<00:01:17.770> it's<00:01:18.039> a<00:01:18.100> very

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
two is a simple goal stretch it's a very

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.130 
two is a simple goal stretch it's a very
subtle<00:01:18.640> stretch<00:01:19.119> but<00:01:19.330> it's<00:01:19.450> a<00:01:19.479> simple<00:01:19.720> stretch

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
subtle stretch but it's a simple stretch

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.010 
subtle stretch but it's a simple stretch
for<00:01:20.920> your<00:01:21.039> hip<00:01:21.310> area<00:01:21.490> that<00:01:22.179> should<00:01:22.390> loosen<00:01:22.869> you

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
for your hip area that should loosen you

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.440 
for your hip area that should loosen you
up<00:01:23.050> enough<00:01:23.950> to<00:01:24.640> create<00:01:24.909> some<00:01:25.030> more<00:01:25.149> club<00:01:25.420> head

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
up enough to create some more club head

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.479 
up enough to create some more club head
speed<00:01:25.630> in<00:01:26.380> your<00:01:26.590> golf<00:01:26.800> swing<00:01:26.950> and<00:01:27.160> here<00:01:27.310> it<00:01:27.399> is

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:27.489 
speed in your golf swing and here it is

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:29.249 
speed in your golf swing and here it is
we're<00:01:28.360> going<00:01:28.450> to<00:01:28.539> get<00:01:28.630> a<00:01:28.690> straddle<00:01:29.140> position

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
we're going to get a straddle position

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.830 
we're going to get a straddle position
here<00:01:29.800> and<00:01:29.950> then<00:01:30.640> I'm<00:01:30.819> going<00:01:30.970> to<00:01:31.000> rotate<00:01:31.239> out<00:01:31.660> my

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
here and then I'm going to rotate out my

going to really turn my right leg inward
and<00:01:37.720> you<00:01:37.899> can<00:01:38.050> kind<00:01:38.259> of<00:01:38.289> picture<00:01:38.530> my<00:01:39.099> golf

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
and you can kind of picture my golf

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.580 
and you can kind of picture my golf
swing<00:01:39.489> rotating<00:01:40.360> through<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:40.959> golf<00:01:41.170> ball<00:01:41.410> so
