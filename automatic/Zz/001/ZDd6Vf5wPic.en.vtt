00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.609 
volt batteries to create 12 volt
batteries<00:01:59.969> usually<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.079> lower<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.469> voltage

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
batteries usually the lower the voltage

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.499 
batteries usually the lower the voltage
of<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.009> battery<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.520> longer<00:02:02.969> will<00:02:03.149> retain

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.510 
of the battery the longer will retain
its<00:02:03.750> charge<00:02:04.110> usually<00:02:04.710> it's<00:02:05.009> available<00:02:05.159> on<00:02:05.490> a

its charge usually it's available on a

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.490 
its charge usually it's available on a
higher<00:02:05.759> amp<00:02:06.060> hours<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:07.049> usually<00:02:07.140> does

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
higher amp hours and it usually does

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.229 
higher amp hours and it usually does
have<00:02:07.710> more<00:02:07.950> charges<00:02:08.399> within<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.789> life<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.149> the

product<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:10.259> for<00:02:10.500> example<00:02:10.950> if<00:02:11.039> you're<00:02:11.160> going

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
product so for example if you're going

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.220 
product so for example if you're going
to<00:02:11.340> use<00:02:11.580> if<00:02:11.940> you're<00:02:12.540> going<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.720> set<00:02:12.870> up<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:13.020> new

system and you have the option of using

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.570 
system and you have the option of using
six<00:02:15.660> volt<00:02:15.840> batteries<00:02:16.290> in<00:02:16.710> series<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.490> then

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
six volt batteries in series and then

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.370 
six volt batteries in series and then
