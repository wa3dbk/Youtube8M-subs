00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.910
 hello and welcome to this news 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.980
 video 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.010
 so today we will learn to 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.650
 do the melody so what is the purpose of the 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:34.490
 same lineage nothing is very simple so 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:37.720
 it's a loop on your 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:40.820
 choice to avoid dredging 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.980
 so to do that it's going to be very 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.930
 so simple when making his housing 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.910
 to whip 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.000
 normal when we arrive at the last 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:55.699
 movement before just do a 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:59.239
 it's with his hand or one of the following 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:03.650
 change in which you will do this 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.239
 movement a loop will form so 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.780
 your self will not be right 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:12.650
 she will be curvet on the side where you will have 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:16.240
 so does this move actually it takes 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.740
 guide signed with the tip of your cane 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.500
 you have to draw so be the letter 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.040
 that's it will make you a loop that 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.830
 will go from left to right is a 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.090
 lounges will make a loop that will leave 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:34.220
 from right to left 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.020
 I will show you all that so in 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.330
 a first time pretty close and I'm 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.500
 provided as and when 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.000
 to that much 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.940
 you can see forgiveness the loop that 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.440
 so it's mending so it's very 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.110
 useful in the river when you have 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.370
 different currents that has it faster 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.650
 that the other just have to do a 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.810
 meeting on where the current is going 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.400
 faster and you will win the 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.200
 precious seconds that will allow you 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.950
 to take fish and so avoid 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.500
 to your flies to dredge go to 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:11.290
 how also so the new I you the 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:16.790
 recalls last move before one of 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:18.790
 last moves before one then went 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.340
 seen from the side 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.340
 two sides of the amusements before I know 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.900
 the more you will make your move early than 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.140
 the manding will be near the bottom of 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.150
 line 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.380
 the more you no more to do 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.160
 will locate very can 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.930
 so without making it confess to dosing next 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.930
 we wanted it to be at naked mendy's 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.600
 here I have a loop that is very strong 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.970
 but I start as Hautcharage 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.800
 know I like my loop 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:58.130
 on our side it's exactly the same 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:03:00.140
 thing I once the genome ending ac I the 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.630
 do a lot earlier the loop is 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.470
 much further I will show you 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:09.550
 his last time but I have my same 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.550
 air dinner that is done 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.340
 I hope you understand 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.530
 this technique which is pretty simple if 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.150
 you have questions do not hesitate to 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.980
 following this video on the channel 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.100
 youtube you can post them 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.670
 comments I will answer from unexpected to 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.120
 very soon 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.120
 goodbye
