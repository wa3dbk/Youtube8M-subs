whatever<00:01:00.149> but<00:01:00.750> here<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.350> know<00:01:01.469> don't<00:01:01.710> you

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890

whatever but here you know don't you
premature<00:01:02.280> optimization<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:02.969> root<00:01:03.030> of

all evil don't don't hurt yourself doing

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.590 
all evil don't don't hurt yourself doing
that<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.729> here<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.880> rigidbody<00:01:06.150> we're<00:01:06.420> going

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
that so here the rigidbody we're going

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.929 
that so here the rigidbody we're going
to<00:01:06.689> add<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.869> force<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.710> again<00:01:08.640> we're<00:01:08.760> going<00:01:08.850> to

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
to add a force and again we're going to

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.160 
to add a force and again we're going to
use<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.180> sort<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.450> format<00:01:09.689> we're<00:01:09.930> gonna<00:01:10.020> be

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
use this sort of format we're gonna be

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.020 
use this sort of format we're gonna be
adding<00:01:10.409> some<00:01:10.439> kind<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.040> force<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.850> x

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
adding some kind of force in the x

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.510 
adding some kind of force in the x
coordinate<00:01:12.450> let's<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:13.080> know<00:01:13.740> 300<00:01:14.189> was<00:01:14.280> working

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
coordinate let's I know 300 was working

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.830 
coordinate let's I know 300 was working
pretty<00:01:14.640> well<00:01:14.760> before<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:15.900> x<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:17.100> english

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
pretty well before so this x in english

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.760 
pretty well before so this x in english
and<00:01:18.890> zero<00:01:19.890> zero<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.570> if<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.110> ball<00:01:22.259> strikes<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
and zero zero so if the ball strikes the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.370 
and zero zero so if the ball strikes the
paddle<00:01:23.040> directly<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.759> middle<00:01:23.880> then<00:01:24.869> it's

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
paddle directly in the middle then it's

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.539 
paddle directly in the middle then it's
not<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.680> add<00:01:25.799> any<00:01:26.009> sort<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.280> lateral

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
not going to add any sort of lateral

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.340 
not going to add any sort of lateral
motion<00:01:26.759> whatsoever<00:01:27.119> but<00:01:27.869> if<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.080> hits<00:01:28.170> it

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
motion whatsoever but if it hits it

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.960 
motion whatsoever but if it hits it
towards<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.770> right<00:01:28.920> or<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.310> left<00:01:29.430> then<00:01:29.820> it's

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
towards the right or the left then it's

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.429 
towards the right or the left then it's
going<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.270> fire<00:01:30.540> off<00:01:30.720> at<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.020> slightly<00:01:31.350> more

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
going to fire off at a slightly more

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.950 
going to fire off at a slightly more
severe<00:01:31.829> angle<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:33.090> illustrate<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.659> or

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
severe angle and to illustrate that or

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.300 
severe angle and to illustrate that or
test<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.320> more<00:01:34.619> easily<00:01:34.770> we're<00:01:35.009> gonna<00:01:35.100> go<00:01:35.189> back

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
test it more easily we're gonna go back

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.469 
test it more easily we're gonna go back
to<00:01:35.369> our<00:01:35.460> ball<00:01:35.640> script<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.090> make<00:01:36.210> sure<00:01:36.360> that

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
to our ball script and make sure that

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.240 
to our ball script and make sure that
our<00:01:36.600> ball<00:01:36.780> starts<00:01:37.079> off<00:01:37.259> going<00:01:37.799> straight<00:01:38.130> up

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
our ball starts off going straight up

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.149 
our ball starts off going straight up
and<00:01:38.400> down<00:01:38.810> so<00:01:39.810> now<00:01:40.759> I've<00:01:41.759> done<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:41.970> wrong<00:01:43.159> check

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
and down so now I've done it wrong check

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.870 
and down so now I've done it wrong check
a<00:01:44.490> syntax<00:01:45.479> there's<00:01:45.659> no<00:01:45.899> we'd<00:01:46.470> play<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.670> should

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
a syntax there's no we'd play it should

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.370 
a syntax there's no we'd play it should
go<00:01:48.000> straight<00:01:48.270> up<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.780> then<00:01:48.990> bounce<00:01:49.200> straight

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
go straight up and then bounce straight

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.170 
go straight up and then bounce straight
down<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.220> then<00:01:50.460> keep<00:01:50.640> going

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
down and then keep going

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.030 
down and then keep going
excellent<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.229> now<00:01:52.320> if<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.470> move<00:01:52.619> slightly

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
excellent and now if I move slightly

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.580 
excellent and now if I move slightly
over<00:01:53.369> here<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.270> ball<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.450> gonna<00:01:54.570> hit<00:01:54.810> and

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
over here and the ball is gonna hit and

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.469 
over here and the ball is gonna hit and
fire<00:01:55.799> off<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.130> side<00:01:56.280> which<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.090> exactly

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
fire off to the side which is exactly

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.940 
fire off to the side which is exactly
what<00:01:57.630> we<00:01:57.689> want<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.079> now<00:01:58.110> we've<00:01:58.469> got<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.680> little

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
what we want so now we've got a little

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.520 
what we want so now we've got a little
bit<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.250> control<00:01:59.630> over<00:02:00.630> where<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.380> ball<00:02:01.500> is

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
bit of control over where the ball is

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.740 
bit of control over where the ball is
going<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.770> go<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.270> very<00:02:03.630> very

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
going to go and this is very very

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.290 
going to go and this is very very
typical<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:04.409> kind<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.740> game

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.880 

good<00:02:11.300> looks<00:02:11.540> excellent<00:02:11.810> so<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.590> next<00:02:12.739> thing

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
good looks excellent so the next thing

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.460 
good looks excellent so the next thing
we<00:02:12.980> want<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.190> do<00:02:13.340> is<00:02:13.519> work<00:02:14.030> on<00:02:14.300> and<00:02:15.170> having<00:02:15.319> the

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
we want to do is work on and having the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.990 
we want to do is work on and having the
bricks<00:02:15.650> die<00:02:15.800> because<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.519> course<00:02:16.760> that's<00:02:16.849> an

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
bricks die because of course that's an

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.790 
bricks die because of course that's an
important<00:02:17.239> part<00:02:17.390> of<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.510> game<00:02:17.599> and<00:02:18.470> yeah<00:02:18.590> this

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
important part of the game and yeah this

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.050 
important part of the game and yeah this
always<00:02:19.160> happens<00:02:19.519> in<00:02:19.580> these<00:02:19.730> sorts<00:02:19.970> of<00:02:20.000> games

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
always happens in these sorts of games

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.729 
always happens in these sorts of games
you<00:02:20.390> keep<00:02:20.629> adding<00:02:20.870> that<00:02:21.140> sort<00:02:21.349> of<00:02:21.379> lateral

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
you keep adding that sort of lateral

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:22.809 
you keep adding that sort of lateral
motion<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.130> speed<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.400> there<00:02:22.519> you<00:02:22.640> go<00:02:22.700> you

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
motion and speed and there you go you

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.720 
motion and speed and there you go you
can<00:02:22.880> sort<00:02:23.300> of<00:02:23.360> arrest<00:02:23.660> it<00:02:23.810> just<00:02:24.140> a<00:02:24.349> little<00:02:24.440> bit

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
can sort of arrest it just a little bit

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.800 
can sort of arrest it just a little bit
also<00:02:25.730> at<00:02:25.819> some<00:02:25.910> point<00:02:26.120> going<00:02:26.239> to<00:02:26.330> have<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.599> make

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
also at some point going to have to make

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.140 
also at some point going to have to make
sure<00:02:26.930> our<00:02:27.319> board<00:02:27.890> our<00:02:28.400> paddle<00:02:28.730> can't<00:02:28.970> leave

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
sure our board our paddle can't leave

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.690 
sure our board our paddle can't leave
the<00:02:29.510> game<00:02:30.050> area<00:02:30.319> so<00:02:31.040> we<00:02:31.130> want<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.340> cubes<00:02:31.580> to

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
the game area so we want the cubes to

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.949 
the game area so we want the cubes to
die<00:02:31.819> next<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.180> bricks<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.510> die<00:02:32.599> necks<00:02:32.810> which

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
die next the bricks the die necks which

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.460 
die next the bricks the die necks which
means<00:02:33.140> of<00:02:33.290> course<00:02:33.470> we<00:02:33.590> need<00:02:33.709> another<00:02:33.860> script

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
means of course we need another script

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.720 
means of course we need another script
this<00:02:36.470> is<00:02:36.530> going<00:02:36.799> to<00:02:36.860> be<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.069> brick<00:02:37.190> script<00:02:37.519> and

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
this is going to be the brick script and

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.160 
this is going to be the brick script and
boy<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.180> hope<00:02:38.450> I<00:02:38.540> don't<00:02:38.599> have<00:02:38.750> to<00:02:38.810> say<00:02:38.930> that<00:02:39.049> too

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
boy I hope I don't have to say that too

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
boy I hope I don't have to say that too
often<00:02:39.319> because<00:02:39.650> that's<00:02:39.799> a<00:02:39.920> little<00:02:40.069> bit

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
often because that's a little bit

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.960 
often because that's a little bit
challenging<00:02:40.340> to<00:02:40.730> say<00:02:41.120> and<00:02:41.680> our<00:02:42.680> bricks<00:02:42.970> really

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
challenging to say and our bricks really

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.069 
challenging to say and our bricks really
don't<00:02:44.120> have<00:02:44.180> much<00:02:44.360> going<00:02:44.569> on<00:02:44.690> except<00:02:44.959> they're

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
don't have much going on except they're

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.289 
don't have much going on except they're
also<00:02:45.260> going<00:02:45.530> to<00:02:45.590> need<00:02:45.709> in<00:02:45.950> on<00:02:46.190> collision<00:02:47.140> enter

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
also going to need in on collision enter

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.080 
also going to need in on collision enter
collision<00:02:51.640> really<00:02:52.640> there<00:02:52.790> I<00:02:52.940> don't<00:02:53.000> think

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
collision really there I don't think

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.400 
collision really there I don't think
they're<00:02:53.269> even<00:02:53.450> use<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.780> collision<00:02:54.079> object

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
they're even use the collision object

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.120 
they're even use the collision object
frankly<00:02:54.890> we're<00:02:55.340> just<00:02:55.489> going<00:02:55.640> to<00:02:55.670> do<00:02:55.880> I<00:02:56.150> destroy

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
frankly we're just going to do I destroy

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.009 
frankly we're just going to do I destroy
and<00:02:58.130> we're<00:02:58.280> gonna<00:02:58.370> destroy<00:02:58.700> our<00:02:58.870> current<00:02:59.870> game

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
and we're gonna destroy our current game

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.900 
and we're gonna destroy our current game
object<00:03:00.410> as<00:03:00.650> in<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.190> brick<00:03:01.370> is<00:03:01.489> going<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.760> kill

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
object as in the brick is going to kill

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.020 
object as in the brick is going to kill
itself<00:03:02.470> that's<00:03:03.470> it<00:03:04.180> play<00:03:05.500> and<00:03:07.030> nothing

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
itself that's it play and nothing

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.090 
itself that's it play and nothing
happens<00:03:08.360> you<00:03:08.569> guys<00:03:08.870> know<00:03:09.079> why<00:03:09.260> I<00:03:09.560> know<00:03:09.859> why

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
happens you guys know why I know why

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.009 
happens you guys know why I know why
this<00:03:10.160> happens<00:03:10.609> all<00:03:10.850> the<00:03:10.880> time<00:03:11.030> to<00:03:11.359> me<00:03:11.480> of

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
this happens all the time to me of

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.800 
this happens all the time to me of
course<00:03:12.319> forgot<00:03:12.620> to<00:03:12.739> apply<00:03:12.829> the<00:03:13.010> brick<00:03:13.310> script

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
course forgot to apply the brick script

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.840 
course forgot to apply the brick script
to<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:14.989> bricks<00:03:15.200> now<00:03:15.920> I<00:03:15.950> should<00:03:16.519> be<00:03:16.670> able<00:03:16.760> to

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
to the bricks now I should be able to

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.210 
to the bricks now I should be able to
drag<00:03:17.120> it<00:03:17.269> from<00:03:17.420> here<00:03:17.750> to<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:18.019> hierarchy<00:03:18.350> let's

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
drag it from here to the hierarchy let's

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.470 
drag it from here to the hierarchy let's
go<00:03:19.370> and<00:03:19.519> find<00:03:19.670> out<00:03:19.790> I'm<00:03:19.880> gonna<00:03:20.000> drag<00:03:20.269> it<00:03:20.359> to<00:03:20.420> the

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
go and find out I'm gonna drag it to the

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.479 
go and find out I'm gonna drag it to the
bottom<00:03:20.569> one<00:03:20.989> so<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:21.799> bottom<00:03:22.040> one<00:03:22.130> has<00:03:22.250> a<00:03:22.280> brick

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
bottom one so the bottom one has a brick

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:23.800 
bottom one so the bottom one has a brick
script<00:03:22.760> and<00:03:23.000> if<00:03:23.060> I<00:03:23.120> go<00:03:23.239> up<00:03:23.329> to<00:03:23.389> the<00:03:23.450> next<00:03:23.540> one

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
script and if I go up to the next one

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.710 
script and if I go up to the next one
nope<00:03:24.079> no<00:03:24.410> script<00:03:24.850> so<00:03:25.850> what<00:03:26.060> I<00:03:26.090> could<00:03:26.389> do<00:03:26.540> is

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
nope no script so what I could do is

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.569 
nope no script so what I could do is
from<00:03:26.959> here<00:03:27.139> I<00:03:27.170> could<00:03:27.260> say<00:03:27.530> apply<00:03:28.160> this<00:03:28.220> to<00:03:28.549> the

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
from here I could say apply this to the

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.069 
from here I could say apply this to the
prefab<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.150> then<00:03:29.269> it<00:03:29.359> would<00:03:29.450> all<00:03:29.600> get<00:03:29.780> it<00:03:29.900> or

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
prefab and then it would all get it or

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:34.780 
prefab and then it would all get it or
if<00:03:30.230> I<00:03:30.319> undo<00:03:30.739> here<00:03:32.709> or<00:03:33.709> let's<00:03:34.010> just<00:03:34.100> remove<00:03:34.670> it

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
if I undo here or let's just remove it

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.629 
if I undo here or let's just remove it
because<00:03:34.910> I<00:03:35.090> realized<00:03:35.420> I<00:03:36.040> when<00:03:37.040> you<00:03:37.130> undo<00:03:37.430> it'll

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
because I realized I when you undo it'll

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.640 
because I realized I when you undo it'll
also<00:03:37.760> undo<00:03:38.090> like<00:03:38.269> selections<00:03:38.840> so<00:03:39.319> I<00:03:39.380> head<00:03:39.560> and

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
also undo like selections so I head and

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.530 
also undo like selections so I head and
hit<00:03:39.769> back<00:03:39.950> so<00:03:40.160> I<00:03:40.370> removed<00:03:40.670> that<00:03:40.760> script<00:03:41.060> what<00:03:41.510> I

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
hit back so I removed that script what I

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.789 
hit back so I removed that script what I
can<00:03:41.690> do<00:03:41.780> is<00:03:41.900> take<00:03:42.019> this<00:03:42.139> brick<00:03:42.350> script<00:03:42.620> and

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
can do is take this brick script and

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.190 
can do is take this brick script and
drag<00:03:43.160> it<00:03:43.280> directly<00:03:43.459> to<00:03:43.850> the<00:03:43.940> brick<00:03:44.090> prefab<00:03:44.630> so

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
drag it directly to the brick prefab so

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.740 
drag it directly to the brick prefab so
now<00:03:45.319> the<00:03:45.380> prefab<00:03:45.950> has<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:46.340> script<00:03:46.609> and<00:03:47.420> so<00:03:47.630> do

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
now the prefab has the script and so do

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:56.059 
now the prefab has the script and so do
all<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:47.989> others<00:03:48.170> so<00:03:48.380> now<00:03:49.250> if<00:03:49.459> we<00:03:49.489> run<00:03:49.760> this<00:03:50.920> hey

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.229 

look<00:03:57.069> at<00:03:57.160> that<00:03:57.310> now<00:03:57.790> we're<00:03:57.910> starting<00:03:58.030> get

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
look at that now we're starting get

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:05.610 
look at that now we're starting get
pretty<00:03:58.510> damn<00:03:58.660> close<00:03:58.840> to<00:03:59.020> having<00:03:59.170> a<00:03:59.290> game<00:04:04.620> now

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
pretty damn close to having a game now

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.680 
pretty damn close to having a game now
let's<00:04:06.040> say<00:04:06.160> we're<00:04:06.280> not<00:04:06.370> happy<00:04:06.760> with<00:04:07.180> I<00:04:07.540> don't

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
let's say we're not happy with I don't

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.630 
let's say we're not happy with I don't
know<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:08.080> the<00:04:08.290> paddle<00:04:08.620> movement<00:04:08.950> okay<00:04:09.459> we're

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
know the the paddle movement okay we're

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.759 
know the the paddle movement okay we're
not<00:04:09.700> happy<00:04:10.000> with<00:04:10.090> the<00:04:10.209> speed<00:04:10.420> now<00:04:11.319> what<00:04:11.650> we

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
not happy with the speed now what we

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.170 
not happy with the speed now what we
could<00:04:11.980> do<00:04:12.130> or<00:04:12.370> what<00:04:12.519> we'd<00:04:12.640> have<00:04:12.760> to<00:04:12.819> do<00:04:13.000> right

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
could do or what we'd have to do right

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.059 
could do or what we'd have to do right
now<00:04:13.300> the<00:04:13.989> speed<00:04:14.260> of<00:04:14.380> the<00:04:14.440> paddle<00:04:14.739> what<00:04:14.860> is<00:04:14.950> it

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
now the speed of the paddle what is it

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:16.860 
now the speed of the paddle what is it
what<00:04:15.580> is<00:04:15.610> it<00:04:15.700> controlled<00:04:16.090> by<00:04:16.209> well<00:04:16.480> really

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
what is it controlled by well really

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.590 
what is it controlled by well really
it's<00:04:16.989> this<00:04:17.079> ten<00:04:17.380> F<00:04:17.560> right<00:04:17.739> now<00:04:17.950> well<00:04:18.459> that's

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
it's this ten F right now well that's

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.580 
it's this ten F right now well that's
hard-coded<00:04:19.600> in<00:04:19.750> and<00:04:19.959> in<00:04:20.200> the<00:04:20.260> middle<00:04:20.440> of<00:04:20.530> a

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
hard-coded in and in the middle of a

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.230 
hard-coded in and in the middle of a
function<00:04:20.919> that's<00:04:21.010> not<00:04:21.160> very<00:04:21.250> good<00:04:21.370> clearly<00:04:22.150> at

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
function that's not very good clearly at

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.490 
function that's not very good clearly at
the<00:04:22.330> very<00:04:22.540> least<00:04:22.660> what<00:04:22.870> we<00:04:22.960> want<00:04:23.110> to<00:04:23.169> do<00:04:23.290> is

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
the very least what we want to do is

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.970 
the very least what we want to do is
maybe<00:04:23.830> do<00:04:23.950> something<00:04:24.130> like<00:04:24.750> move<00:04:25.750> it<00:04:25.870> out<00:04:25.990> to<00:04:26.230> a

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
maybe do something like move it out to a

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.390 
maybe do something like move it out to a
paddle<00:04:27.639> speed<00:04:27.880> out<00:04:28.120> here<00:04:28.860> right<00:04:29.860> we<00:04:30.190> can<00:04:30.310> do

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
paddle speed out here right we can do

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.020 
paddle speed out here right we can do
that<00:04:30.520> I<00:04:30.760> knew<00:04:31.450> that<00:04:31.600> that<00:04:32.440> works<00:04:32.650> fine<00:04:33.030> but

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
that I knew that that works fine but

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.090 
that I knew that that works fine but
we're<00:04:34.750> still<00:04:34.930> having<00:04:35.110> to<00:04:35.229> change<00:04:35.560> the<00:04:35.860> number

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
we're still having to change the number

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.409 
we're still having to change the number
if<00:04:36.190> we<00:04:36.250> decide<00:04:36.520> we<00:04:36.550> want<00:04:36.790> the<00:04:36.970> paddle<00:04:37.210> to<00:04:37.240> move

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
if we decide we want the paddle to move

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.570 
if we decide we want the paddle to move
50%<00:04:38.410> faster<00:04:38.680> we<00:04:38.770> could<00:04:38.830> change<00:04:38.979> it<00:04:39.100> to<00:04:39.160> a<00:04:39.250> 15

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
50% faster we could change it to a 15

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.790 
50% faster we could change it to a 15
here<00:04:39.990> but<00:04:40.990> we're<00:04:41.110> still<00:04:41.290> messing<00:04:41.560> around<00:04:41.620> with

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
here but we're still messing around with

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.560 
here but we're still messing around with
code<00:04:42.100> and<00:04:42.310> one<00:04:42.790> of<00:04:42.880> the<00:04:42.970> things<00:04:43.120> that<00:04:43.240> unity

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
code and one of the things that unity

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:44.820 
code and one of the things that unity
does<00:04:43.690> pretty<00:04:43.930> well<00:04:44.020> is<00:04:44.200> if<00:04:44.320> we<00:04:44.410> sent<00:04:44.620> this<00:04:44.680> to

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
does pretty well is if we sent this to

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.219 
does pretty well is if we sent this to
be<00:04:44.950> a<00:04:44.979> public<00:04:45.400> variable<00:04:45.580> and<00:04:46.020> then<00:04:47.020> switch

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
be a public variable and then switch

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:49.740 
be a public variable and then switch
back<00:04:47.410> to<00:04:47.440> the<00:04:47.560> editor<00:04:47.889> and<00:04:48.180> select<00:04:49.180> our<00:04:49.389> paddle

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
back to the editor and select our paddle

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.719 
back to the editor and select our paddle
and<00:04:50.080> look<00:04:50.229> at<00:04:50.350> the<00:04:50.410> script<00:04:50.740> here<00:04:50.979> you<00:04:51.370> can<00:04:51.550> see

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
and look at the script here you can see

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.210 
and look at the script here you can see
now<00:04:51.880> it's<00:04:52.150> actually<00:04:52.360> got<00:04:52.840> a<00:04:53.110> value<00:04:53.860> here<00:04:54.070> for

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
now it's actually got a value here for

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.860 
now it's actually got a value here for
the<00:04:54.280> paddle<00:04:54.460> speed<00:04:54.760> which<00:04:55.210> we<00:04:55.389> can<00:04:55.510> change<00:04:55.690> we

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
the paddle speed which we can change we

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.600 
the paddle speed which we can change we
can<00:04:55.990> change<00:04:56.020> this<00:04:56.320> to<00:04:56.380> say<00:04:56.620> 20<00:04:56.979> in<00:04:57.160> here<00:04:57.460> and

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
can change this to say 20 in here and

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.779 
can change this to say 20 in here and
hit<00:04:58.389> play<00:04:58.600> and<00:04:58.930> now<00:04:59.680> the<00:04:59.740> paddle<00:05:00.100> Wolff<00:05:00.280> it's

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
hit play and now the paddle Wolff it's

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:02.610 
hit play and now the paddle Wolff it's
quite<00:05:01.090> zippy<00:05:01.419> in<00:05:01.630> fact<00:05:01.930> a<00:05:02.110> little<00:05:02.260> bit<00:05:02.440> too

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
quite zippy in fact a little bit too

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.850 
quite zippy in fact a little bit too
fast<00:05:02.830> to<00:05:03.010> control<00:05:04.200> but<00:05:05.200> we<00:05:05.320> can<00:05:05.440> even<00:05:05.530> change

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
fast to control but we can even change

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.100 
fast to control but we can even change
this<00:05:06.190> let<00:05:06.580> me<00:05:06.610> pause<00:05:06.880> just<00:05:07.660> because<00:05:07.870> I<00:05:07.900> don't

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
this let me pause just because I don't

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.350 
this let me pause just because I don't
lose<00:05:08.169> my<00:05:08.350> ball<00:05:10.620> and<00:05:11.620> unpause<00:05:12.250> and<00:05:12.580> now<00:05:13.180> it's<00:05:13.330> a

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
lose my ball and unpause and now it's a

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.820 
lose my ball and unpause and now it's a
really<00:05:13.720> fast<00:05:13.930> they<00:05:14.320> don't<00:05:14.470> actually<00:05:14.590> have<00:05:14.740> to

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
really fast they don't actually have to

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.469 
really fast they don't actually have to
pause<00:05:15.070> imma<00:05:15.370> just<00:05:15.550> for<00:05:15.669> convenience<00:05:15.820> I<00:05:16.120> hit<00:05:16.270> 10

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
pause imma just for convenience I hit 10

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:18.540 
pause imma just for convenience I hit 10
and<00:05:16.930> now<00:05:17.289> now<00:05:17.919> it's<00:05:17.950> much<00:05:18.250> more<00:05:18.400> manageable

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
and now now it's much more manageable

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.150 
and now now it's much more manageable
you<00:05:19.210> can<00:05:19.360> change<00:05:19.600> these<00:05:19.780> values<00:05:19.979> during<00:05:20.979> a

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
you can change these values during a

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.730 
you can change these values during a
gameplay<00:05:21.760> one<00:05:22.510> of<00:05:22.570> the<00:05:22.660> only<00:05:22.780> gotchas<00:05:23.260> well

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
gameplay one of the only gotchas well

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.800 
gameplay one of the only gotchas well
first<00:05:23.979> of<00:05:24.070> all<00:05:24.130> when<00:05:24.280> I'm<00:05:24.370> unpause<00:05:24.789> or<00:05:25.570> when<00:05:25.750> I

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
first of all when I'm unpause or when I

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.600 
first of all when I'm unpause or when I
stop<00:05:26.020> the<00:05:26.050> game<00:05:26.320> it<00:05:26.500> went<00:05:26.650> back<00:05:26.800> to<00:05:26.830> the<00:05:26.979> actual

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
stop the game it went back to the actual

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.000 
stop the game it went back to the actual
value<00:05:27.910> from<00:05:28.090> before<00:05:28.510> the<00:05:28.930> gameplay<00:05:29.350> which<00:05:29.860> is

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
value from before the gameplay which is

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.440 
value from before the gameplay which is
20<00:05:30.340> so<00:05:30.490> before<00:05:30.729> I<00:05:30.760> started<00:05:31.000> tweaking<00:05:31.300> things

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
20 so before I started tweaking things

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.300 
20 so before I started tweaking things
that's<00:05:31.720> one<00:05:31.900> gotchu<00:05:32.139> and<00:05:32.680> obviously<00:05:33.190> it

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
that's one gotchu and obviously it

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.540 
that's one gotchu and obviously it
doesn't<00:05:33.460> change<00:05:33.669> the<00:05:33.789> code<00:05:34.090> in<00:05:34.510> your<00:05:35.550> it

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
doesn't change the code in your it

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.010 
doesn't change the code in your it
doesn't<00:05:36.820> change<00:05:36.910> the<00:05:37.090> value<00:05:37.389> in<00:05:37.419> your<00:05:37.600> actual

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
doesn't change the value in your actual

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.170 
doesn't change the value in your actual
program<00:05:38.410> code<00:05:38.650> and<00:05:39.430> what's<00:05:39.610> also<00:05:39.820> quite

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
program code and what's also quite

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.029 
program code and what's also quite
confusing<00:05:40.690> is<00:05:40.930> let's<00:05:41.110> say<00:05:41.200> I<00:05:41.229> set<00:05:41.410> this<00:05:41.500> to<00:05:41.680> 100

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
confusing is let's say I set this to 100

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:43.529 
confusing is let's say I set this to 100
I<00:05:42.100> wanted<00:05:42.310> a<00:05:42.370> really<00:05:42.639> really<00:05:43.090> really<00:05:43.270> fast

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 
I wanted a really really really fast

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:46.680 
I wanted a really really really fast
paddle<00:05:44.080> I<00:05:44.110> saved<00:05:44.770> I<00:05:45.160> go<00:05:46.090> back<00:05:46.240> over<00:05:46.360> here<00:05:46.479> the

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
paddle I saved I go back over here the

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.210 
paddle I saved I go back over here the

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
script has been recompiled but this

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.730 
script has been recompiled but this
value<00:05:48.400> has<00:05:48.760> not<00:05:49.000> changed<00:05:49.300> and<00:05:50.050> this<00:05:50.440> is<00:05:50.560> what's

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
value has not changed and this is what's

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.860 
value has not changed and this is what's
still<00:05:50.860> going<00:05:50.979> to<00:05:51.250> be<00:05:51.340> used<00:05:51.580> and<00:05:51.910> this<00:05:52.539> happens

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
still going to be used and this happens

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.300 
still going to be used and this happens
to<00:05:52.930> me<00:05:53.020> all<00:05:53.050> the<00:05:53.229> times<00:05:53.500> I'm<00:05:53.680> moving<00:05:53.889> at<00:05:53.950> a<00:05:54.010> 20

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
to me all the times I'm moving at a 20

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.310 
to me all the times I'm moving at a 20
now<00:05:54.430> and<00:05:54.460> not<00:05:54.700> 100<00:05:55.090> this<00:05:55.720> happens<00:05:56.020> to<00:05:56.080> me<00:05:56.169> all

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
now and not 100 this happens to me all

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.719 
now and not 100 this happens to me all
the<00:05:56.350> time<00:05:56.590> where<00:05:56.740> I'm<00:05:56.800> here<00:05:57.010> I'm<00:05:57.070> like<00:05:57.220> what

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:57.729 
the time where I'm here I'm like what

00:05:57.729 --> 00:05:59.520 
the time where I'm here I'm like what
why<00:05:58.180> isn't<00:05:58.479> this<00:05:58.539> change<00:05:58.810> taking<00:05:59.050> effect<00:05:59.380> well

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
why isn't this change taking effect well

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:00.750 
why isn't this change taking effect well
it's<00:05:59.620> because<00:05:59.800> it's<00:05:59.830> public<00:06:00.100> and<00:06:00.370> now<00:06:00.610> it's

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
it's because it's public and now it's

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.950 
it's because it's public and now it's
part<00:06:00.940> of<00:06:01.150> this<00:06:01.360> pedal<00:06:02.220> so<00:06:03.220> if<00:06:03.490> your<00:06:04.180> program<00:06:04.810> or

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
part of this pedal so if your program or

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.930 
part of this pedal so if your program or
pure<00:06:05.169> programmer<00:06:05.620> you<00:06:06.099> may<00:06:06.340> not<00:06:06.520> want<00:06:06.760> to<00:06:06.820> take

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940 
pure programmer you may not want to take

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
that's too too much you probably want to

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:10.599 
do more like this because you're gonna

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:12.510 
do more like this because you're gonna
be<00:06:10.750> tweaking<00:06:10.960> this<00:06:11.500> number<00:06:11.830> here<00:06:12.129> and<00:06:12.310> you

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
be tweaking this number here and you

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.830 
be tweaking this number here and you
don't<00:06:12.639> wanna<00:06:12.759> be<00:06:12.819> confused<00:06:13.210> by<00:06:13.360> the<00:06:13.389> fact

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
don't wanna be confused by the fact

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.480 
don't wanna be confused by the fact
there's<00:06:14.229> a<00:06:14.259> number<00:06:14.379> there<00:06:14.500> yes<00:06:15.069> yeah<00:06:15.220> I<00:06:15.280> took

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
there's a number there yes yeah I took

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.040 
there's a number there yes yeah I took
away<00:06:15.729> the<00:06:15.819> public<00:06:16.000> so<00:06:16.599> now<00:06:16.750> it<00:06:16.810> no<00:06:17.020> longer

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
away the public so now it no longer

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.469 
away the public so now it no longer
shows<00:06:17.740> up<00:06:17.889> in<00:06:18.069> the<00:06:18.190> inspector<00:06:18.520> and<00:06:19.000> we're<00:06:19.360> back

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:19.479 
shows up in the inspector and we're back

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:23.629 
shows up in the inspector and we're back
to<00:06:19.599> a<00:06:19.659> much<00:06:19.810> more<00:06:19.960> reasonable<00:06:20.139> speed<00:06:20.530> of<00:06:20.770> 10

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:27.360 

all<00:06:24.639> right<00:06:25.379> so<00:06:26.379> really<00:06:26.740> the<00:06:26.949> next<00:06:27.069> thing<00:06:27.250> we've

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
all right so really the next thing we've

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.510 
all right so really the next thing we've
got<00:06:27.520> to<00:06:27.639> do<00:06:27.759> is<00:06:28.090> um<00:06:28.539> I<00:06:28.960> guess<00:06:29.710> a<00:06:29.740> scoreboard<00:06:30.129> I

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 
got to do is um I guess a scoreboard I

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.279 
got to do is um I guess a scoreboard I
mean<00:06:31.030> I<00:06:31.150> did<00:06:31.330> that<00:06:31.449> what<00:06:31.720> else<00:06:31.840> do<00:06:31.930> you<00:06:31.990> missing

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:32.289 
mean I did that what else do you missing

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:35.580 
mean I did that what else do you missing
for<00:06:32.470> a<00:06:32.500> game<00:06:32.729> the<00:06:33.729> ball<00:06:33.849> has<00:06:34.000> got<00:06:34.150> a<00:06:34.180> die<00:06:34.960> reset

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590 
for a game the ball has got a die reset

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.070 
for a game the ball has got a die reset
itself<00:06:35.940> there<00:06:36.940> is<00:06:37.030> one<00:06:37.210> other<00:06:37.360> thing<00:06:37.659> in<00:06:37.870> that

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
itself there is one other thing in that

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.020 
itself there is one other thing in that
this<00:06:38.800> is<00:06:38.949> not<00:06:39.099> generally<00:06:39.340> how<00:06:39.639> these<00:06:39.819> games

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
this is not generally how these games

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.490 
this is not generally how these games
start<00:06:40.419> with<00:06:40.569> the<00:06:40.659> ball<00:06:40.840> already<00:06:41.080> going

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:41.500 
start with the ball already going

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.589 
start with the ball already going
usually<00:06:42.129> they<00:06:42.219> start<00:06:42.280> with<00:06:42.729> the<00:06:42.849> ball<00:06:43.060> stuck

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:43.599 
usually they start with the ball stuck

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:44.909 
usually they start with the ball stuck
to<00:06:43.690> the<00:06:43.810> paddle<00:06:44.169> you<00:06:44.319> can<00:06:44.440> move<00:06:44.590> the<00:06:44.740> paddle

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:44.919 
to the paddle you can move the paddle

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:46.860 
to the paddle you can move the paddle
somewhere<00:06:45.400> and<00:06:45.610> then<00:06:46.060> you<00:06:46.150> can<00:06:46.300> hit<00:06:46.419> usually

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.870 
somewhere and then you can hit usually

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.320 
somewhere and then you can hit usually
say<00:06:47.050> space<00:06:47.440> for<00:06:47.770> example<00:06:47.860> to<00:06:48.550> launch<00:06:48.789> the<00:06:49.120> ball

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330 
say space for example to launch the ball

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.749 
say space for example to launch the ball
some<00:06:50.319> games<00:06:50.500> will<00:06:50.620> also<00:06:50.860> have<00:06:50.949> power-ups<00:06:51.460> like

00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:51.759 
some games will also have power-ups like

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:53.909 
some games will also have power-ups like
a<00:06:52.150> sort<00:06:52.419> of<00:06:52.449> a<00:06:52.539> sticky<00:06:52.930> or<00:06:53.110> a<00:06:53.139> magnetic<00:06:53.710> type

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:53.919 
a sort of a sticky or a magnetic type

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:55.409 
a sort of a sticky or a magnetic type
powerup<00:06:54.310> where<00:06:54.729> if<00:06:54.879> you<00:06:54.969> did<00:06:55.120> something<00:06:55.300> like

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:55.419 
powerup where if you did something like

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:57.689 
powerup where if you did something like
say<00:06:55.810> held<00:06:56.080> shift<00:06:56.409> down<00:06:56.650> then<00:06:57.219> it<00:06:57.310> would<00:06:57.430> enable

00:06:57.689 --> 00:06:57.699 
say held shift down then it would enable

00:06:57.699 --> 00:06:59.640 
say held shift down then it would enable
the<00:06:57.969> stickiness<00:06:58.449> of<00:06:58.690> your<00:06:58.870> paddle<00:06:59.229> and<00:06:59.500> when

00:06:59.640 --> 00:06:59.650 
the stickiness of your paddle and when

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:00.990 
the stickiness of your paddle and when
the<00:06:59.740> ball<00:06:59.860> next<00:07:00.039> touched<00:07:00.340> it<00:07:00.610> would<00:07:00.729> stop

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
the ball next touched it would stop

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.550 
the ball next touched it would stop
there<00:07:01.210> and<00:07:01.360> stick<00:07:01.629> again<00:07:01.870> and<00:07:02.050> then<00:07:02.349> you<00:07:02.440> can

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560 
there and stick again and then you can

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.499 
there and stick again and then you can
reposition<00:07:02.860> it<00:07:03.219> it's<00:07:03.490> a<00:07:03.520> very<00:07:03.729> nice<00:07:03.879> handy

00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:04.509 
reposition it it's a very nice handy

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:06.059 
reposition it it's a very nice handy
powerup<00:07:04.870> to<00:07:04.990> have<00:07:05.139> speaking<00:07:05.710> of<00:07:05.830> power-ups

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:06.069 
powerup to have speaking of power-ups

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:07.050 
powerup to have speaking of power-ups
you<00:07:06.129> could<00:07:06.250> also<00:07:06.370> have<00:07:06.490> things<00:07:06.639> that<00:07:06.819> change

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:07.060 
you could also have things that change

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.610 
you could also have things that change
the<00:07:07.210> size<00:07:07.360> your<00:07:07.539> paddle<00:07:07.930> maybe<00:07:08.349> give<00:07:08.530> you

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:08.620 
the size your paddle maybe give you

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:09.930 
the size your paddle maybe give you
additional<00:07:08.800> balls<00:07:09.219> which<00:07:09.490> tends<00:07:09.699> to<00:07:09.789> be<00:07:09.879> a

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:09.940 
additional balls which tends to be a

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.339 
additional balls which tends to be a
pretty<00:07:10.090> temporary<00:07:10.539> power<00:07:10.719> up<00:07:10.870> because<00:07:11.139> I

00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:11.349 
pretty temporary power up because I

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:13.559 
pretty temporary power up because I
can't<00:07:11.710> balance<00:07:12.520> like<00:07:12.759> three<00:07:13.060> balls<00:07:13.240> at<00:07:13.419> once

00:07:13.559 --> 00:07:13.569 
can't balance like three balls at once

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:15.420 
can't balance like three balls at once
in<00:07:13.690> this<00:07:13.750> game<00:07:13.930> but<00:07:14.110> in<00:07:14.889> the<00:07:14.979> meantime<00:07:15.130> it

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:15.430 
in this game but in the meantime it

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.279 
in this game but in the meantime it
kills<00:07:15.580> a<00:07:15.669> lot<00:07:15.699> of<00:07:15.819> stuff<00:07:16.090> maybe<00:07:16.599> you<00:07:17.139> can

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:17.289 
kills a lot of stuff maybe you can

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:19.230 
kills a lot of stuff maybe you can
change<00:07:17.560> us<00:07:17.710> that<00:07:17.919> instead<00:07:18.310> of<00:07:18.370> bouncing<00:07:19.060> off

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:19.240 
change us that instead of bouncing off

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.390 
change us that instead of bouncing off
of<00:07:19.479> the<00:07:19.569> the<00:07:20.139> bricks<00:07:20.409> it<00:07:20.590> just<00:07:20.740> burns<00:07:21.039> right

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:21.400 
of the the bricks it just burns right

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.309 
of the the bricks it just burns right
through<00:07:21.669> them<00:07:21.789> which<00:07:22.389> is<00:07:22.479> actually<00:07:22.810> more<00:07:22.960> of<00:07:23.020> a

00:07:23.309 --> 00:07:23.319 
through them which is actually more of a

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:25.379 
through them which is actually more of a
change<00:07:24.219> of<00:07:24.430> the<00:07:24.550> bricks<00:07:24.819> property<00:07:25.270> than

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:25.389 
change of the bricks property than

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:26.969 
change of the bricks property than
anything<00:07:25.569> maybe<00:07:25.870> I<00:07:25.990> don't<00:07:26.139> know<00:07:26.349> I<00:07:26.529> mean

00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:26.979 
anything maybe I don't know I mean

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:28.260 
anything maybe I don't know I mean
you're<00:07:27.069> really<00:07:27.190> you're<00:07:27.460> really<00:07:27.490> removing<00:07:28.000> the

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:28.270 
you're really you're really removing the

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.409 
you're really you're really removing the
collision<00:07:28.840> ability<00:07:29.289> of<00:07:29.440> the<00:07:29.620> ball<00:07:29.830> and<00:07:30.419> you're

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:31.419 
collision ability of the ball and you're

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:34.439 
collision ability of the ball and you're
turning<00:07:31.810> it<00:07:31.900> into<00:07:32.139> more<00:07:32.529> of<00:07:32.560> a<00:07:32.800> trigger<00:07:33.370> see<00:07:34.270> is

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:34.449 
turning it into more of a trigger see is

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:38.339 
turning it into more of a trigger see is
trigger<00:07:34.840> yeah<00:07:36.509> I'm<00:07:37.509> not<00:07:37.690> sure<00:07:37.719> actually<00:07:38.110> how

00:07:38.339 --> 00:07:38.349 
trigger yeah I'm not sure actually how

00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:39.390 
trigger yeah I'm not sure actually how
that's<00:07:38.500> going<00:07:38.650> to<00:07:38.710> attract<00:07:38.919> with<00:07:39.069> a<00:07:39.129> rigidbody

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:39.400 
that's going to attract with a rigidbody

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.189 
that's going to attract with a rigidbody
and<00:07:39.699> things<00:07:39.849> I'm<00:07:39.969> gonna<00:07:40.060> have<00:07:40.270> to<00:07:40.419> run<00:07:41.169> a

00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:41.199 
and things I'm gonna have to run a

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:44.580 
and things I'm gonna have to run a
couple<00:07:41.500> of<00:07:41.560> quick<00:07:41.740> tests<00:07:42.750> before<00:07:43.750> I<00:07:43.960> tell<00:07:44.469> you

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:44.590 
couple of quick tests before I tell you

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.350 
couple of quick tests before I tell you
any<00:07:44.770> more<00:07:44.889> lies<00:07:45.159> about<00:07:45.460> the<00:07:45.580> actual<00:07:45.879> solution

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.360 
any more lies about the actual solution

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.519 
any more lies about the actual solution
but<00:07:46.599> regularly<00:07:46.930> because<00:07:47.169> at<00:07:47.319> that<00:07:47.409> point

00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:47.529 
but regularly because at that point

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:49.320 
but regularly because at that point
you're<00:07:47.650> gonna<00:07:47.770> want<00:07:47.949> the<00:07:48.009> ball<00:07:48.159> to<00:07:48.190> go<00:07:48.430> to

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:49.330 
you're gonna want the ball to go to

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:50.730 
you're gonna want the ball to go to
ignore<00:07:49.599> the<00:07:49.719> collisions<00:07:50.080> and<00:07:50.199> almost<00:07:50.529> pass

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:50.740 
ignore the collisions and almost pass

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.379 
ignore the collisions and almost pass
right<00:07:51.250> through<00:07:51.310> the<00:07:51.550> brick<00:07:51.759> and<00:07:51.969> then<00:07:52.300> the

00:07:52.379 --> 00:07:52.389 
right through the brick and then the

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:54.659 
right through the brick and then the
brick<00:07:52.569> still<00:07:52.900> disappear<00:07:53.889> when<00:07:54.159> there's<00:07:54.580> a

00:07:54.659 --> 00:07:54.669 
brick still disappear when there's a

00:07:54.669 --> 00:07:56.580 
brick still disappear when there's a
there's<00:07:55.000> a<00:07:55.060> contact<00:07:55.539> made<00:07:55.719> but<00:07:56.229> you<00:07:56.440> don't

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:56.590 
there's a contact made but you don't

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.219 
there's a contact made but you don't
want<00:07:56.710> to<00:07:56.949> have<00:07:57.310> a<00:07:57.340> physics<00:07:57.849> engine<00:07:58.060> contact<00:07:58.719> so

00:07:59.219 --> 00:07:59.229 
want to have a physics engine contact so

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:00.330 
want to have a physics engine contact so
there's<00:07:59.409> a<00:07:59.440> little<00:07:59.620> bit<00:07:59.710> of<00:07:59.800> fill<00:07:59.979> faddle

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:00.340 
there's a little bit of fill faddle

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.680 
there's a little bit of fill faddle
going<00:08:00.520> on<00:08:00.669> there<00:08:00.879> that<00:08:01.240> you're<00:08:01.360> gonna<00:08:01.479> want<00:08:01.659> to

going on there that you're gonna want to

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.899 
going on there that you're gonna want to
customize<00:08:02.080> but<00:08:02.400> it's<00:08:03.400> looking<00:08:03.639> pretty<00:08:03.729> good

00:08:03.899 --> 00:08:03.909 
customize but it's looking pretty good

00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:06.449 
customize but it's looking pretty good
so<00:08:03.969> far<00:08:04.300> guys
