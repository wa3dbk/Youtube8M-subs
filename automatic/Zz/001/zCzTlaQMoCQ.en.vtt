00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.220
 marcel appia go almost every week 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.620
 christian emilion 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.700
 alireza jahanbakhsh and kristiansand as 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.280
 visiting 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.109
 renÃ© delleman the english teacher at it 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.180
 urban gymnasium nijmegen 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.070
 give private lessons to the quartet and learn 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.720
 she is the Dutch language 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.670
 we took a look to see what the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.410
 players learn 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.410
 I am a sinner round after round 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:57.559
 live different andre yes 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:57.559
 or should i heard it was 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.150
 yes but this is what i hope you have 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.150
 say 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:31.300
 my daughter like that 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:44.200
 you're such a good move 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:45.930
 ow yes and what do you do with the 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.880
 players they do what you learn the most 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.800
 well most important to me was that she already 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.660
 very quickly get through to what was there 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.100
 was said on soccer field 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.259
 it must be very practical of course 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.700
 we have engaged in one 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.619
 little grammar 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.310
 the basics so that they are what I like 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:05.560
 can make sentences but you 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.119
 football terms are on the program 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.580
 At the start, we all have that neatly 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.430
 written down and she really wanted to know what 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.220
 means short or long pole cover 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.769
 go so deep or you name it 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.269
 so actually learn a professional language 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.180
 to control 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.160
 marcel did you hear is someone who 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.680
 smart boy who is already very nice 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.320
 but it must be a compliment on ali riza 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.480
 because both English and Dutch 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.630
 are completely new languages â€‹â€‹for him and 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.310
 when you see 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.300
 a year and a half ago when you arrived 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.980
 he spoke fraction and a little english 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.730
 and if you see what I can do now, he is 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.820
 very leather 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:47.120
 inquisitive and wants to understand and 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.530
 pronounce it correctly so yes 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.490
 he has a kudos for what that 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.680
 concerns 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.960
 and i hope fact that he keeps getting better 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.910
 Dutch is talk that he then 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.120
 decides to stay with us for another year 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.680
 to stay but who knows the lesson existed 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.690
 for marcel appia also from one 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.610
 Dutch interview 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.700
 which of the four actually has it 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.120
 most talent he think amazon do that 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.120
 very well 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:19.640
 sometimes it just has a problem 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:23.350
 normally yes everyone is good 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.350
 wave goodbye 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.320
 we can do a nothing we talk but now 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.270
 are you okay 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.190
 because of the approaching championship 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.050
 ended the lesson by practicing 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.480
 it and e-series club song 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.260
 and that went so well that and nec boy band 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.260
 seems born 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:53.500
 find for black and green 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:56.390
 get away and run and become people 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:04.060
 Lampion 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:04.060
 We take them away and they camp 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:11.930
