00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.950 

I<00:04:19.829> breathe<00:04:20.729> fire<00:04:21.269> at<00:04:21.629> you

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.719 

technically<00:04:25.710> it<00:04:25.830> keeps<00:04:26.070> burning<00:04:26.280> I<00:04:26.580> don't

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
technically it keeps burning I don't

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:28.520 
technically it keeps burning I don't
have<00:04:26.910> to<00:04:27.000> keep<00:04:27.150> reading<00:04:27.539> fire<00:04:27.810> but<00:04:28.169> it<00:04:28.289> looks

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
have to keep reading fire but it looks

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:38.040 
have to keep reading fire but it looks

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.999 

maybe<00:04:39.050> I<00:04:39.139> shouldn't<00:04:39.379> have<00:04:39.439> done<00:04:39.589> that

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:40.009

nope

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.200
