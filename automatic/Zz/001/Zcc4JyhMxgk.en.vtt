00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670

reaction<00:00:11.849> now<00:00:12.269> in<00:00:12.420> normal<00:00:12.599> circumstances<00:00:13.259> I

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
reaction now in normal circumstances I

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.410 
reaction now in normal circumstances I
probably<00:00:13.650> would<00:00:13.889> have<00:00:13.969> made<00:00:14.969> fun<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.210> this

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
probably would have made fun of this

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.790 
probably would have made fun of this
reporters<00:00:15.929> but<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.109> think<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.440> just<00:00:16.590> shows<00:00:16.740> you

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
reporters but I think it just shows you

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.840 
reporters but I think it just shows you
like<00:00:17.100> like<00:00:17.970> why<00:00:18.270> there<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.570> such<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.840> disconnect

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
like like why there is such a disconnect

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.460 
like like why there is such a disconnect
between<00:00:20.850> between<00:00:21.510> reporters<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.380> don't

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
between between reporters and I don't

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.900 
between between reporters and I don't
understand<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.250> that's<00:00:23.369> why<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.550> can't<00:00:23.760> stand

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910
