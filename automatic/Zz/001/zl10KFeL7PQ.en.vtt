ordered so many will get like discounted

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.480 
ordered so many will get like discounted
or<00:02:07.760> it'll<00:02:08.060> be<00:02:08.149> cheaper<00:02:11.350> like<00:02:12.350> I<00:02:12.500> order<00:02:12.830> like<00:02:13.250> if

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
or it'll be cheaper like I order like if

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.420 
or it'll be cheaper like I order like if
you<00:02:13.640> order<00:02:13.940> now<00:02:14.210> it'll<00:02:14.720> be<00:02:14.840> like<00:02:15.100> $9.99<00:02:16.100> for

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
you order now it'll be like $9.99 for

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.220 
you order now it'll be like $9.99 for
the<00:02:16.520> 6<00:02:16.820> plus<00:02:17.000> case<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:17.870> I<00:02:18.050> think<00:02:18.550> $7.99<00:02:19.550> for

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
the 6 plus case and I think $7.99 for

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.150 
the 6 plus case and I think $7.99 for
the<00:02:21.230> regular<00:02:21.710> 6<00:02:23.440> but<00:02:24.440> I<00:02:24.470> when<00:02:24.800> i<00:02:24.860> pre-ordered

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
the regular 6 but I when i pre-ordered

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.000 
the regular 6 but I when i pre-ordered
these<00:02:25.520> 3<00:02:25.820> it<00:02:26.300> only<00:02:26.630> cost<00:02:26.960> me<00:02:27.110> like<00:02:27.440> 10<00:02:27.500> bucks

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
these 3 it only cost me like 10 bucks

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.290 
these 3 it only cost me like 10 bucks
plus<00:02:28.850> I<00:02:29.030> think<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.330> shipping<00:02:29.660> handling<00:02:31.300> so

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
plus I think the shipping handling so

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.430 
plus I think the shipping handling so
you<00:02:32.360> have<00:02:32.510> let's<00:02:32.950> check<00:02:33.950> out<00:02:34.160> this<00:02:35.050> box<00:02:36.050> that
