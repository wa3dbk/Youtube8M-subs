00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.590
 two year old birthday 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.829
 let's explain no he is not two years old 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.470
 yet two years ago on the 12th of 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.540
 October two years ago that I discovered 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.659
 who was pregnant and who were pregnant 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.869
 following so it is a date for 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.340
 get cured is the son advice on 2 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.680
 October is a very special day for 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.020
 Because of this, it's the day the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.689
 people discovered that little girl was 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.880
 In this life he is no longer a black son doing 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.759
 a test I'm shooting with a camera 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.780
 photographic people these first lines 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:34.619
 normal, that's not even my face, right? 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.570
 but that 's okay not see william and hi 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.170
 will it be that good quality of this 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.880
 camera is a test I made to see if 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.530
 I can go out with her because it's too 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.159
 easier to carry in the bag 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.290
 my little camera is this than the 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.600
 Let's see what I'm going to do. 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.600
 I close my mouth by experimenting 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.219
 do everything the same as will 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.870
 said even let fail to see a 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.520
 test 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:06.020
 It's good and I have 10g of new plans I 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.300
 I think you saw the program of the 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.030
 youtube revealed the trumpet with our 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.310
 friend dani bellan because it is a project well 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.770
 here I already wanted to do it but I 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.870
 I did not have time for the right time 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.230
 yet to do so right now I made a 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.970
 pilot and of course will be full of 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.400
 modifications in the next programs until 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:30.350
 arrive in the legal format so for you 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.060
 I certainly accepted October suggestions. 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.370
 What do you want me to do? 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.590
 interview I 'm feeling the joe 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.260
 soares 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:42.890
 but all right there so I loved the return 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.110
 Positive that you have passed me nothing 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.240
 so sure the project will 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.070
 continue to face with certainty 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.870
 Another thing, I was very 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.030
 Happy how you liked the videos. 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.690
 answer of clothing books answer 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.250

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.040
 is a form that I found to be able to 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.330
 Answering, I really enjoyed doing. 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.160
 just so it has to be a little bit 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.950
 The faster I actually want to start. 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.870
 to make faster to for 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.090
 answers are faster who you have 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.540
 interest in seeing the answer that I go 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.250
 to give 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.020
 I end up giving a video answer 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.120
 new video that has enough response 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.500
 yes I continue I'm going to make a video 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.370
 answer to be able to respond more 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.370
 fast I met my job here 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:32.090
 What else did you want to talk about then Saturday was 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.630
 Children's day, I want to send a kiss 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.840
 special for all the children who 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:41.000
 have been accompanying for years that the 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:45.160
 iran's only personal non iran is 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.160
 because they've hit the charts in the past 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.750
 It's the fall, too, a kiss for 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:56.750
 You my dear is the one I told you to go. 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:02.810
 a message recorded on a video 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:05.540
 All is well with you in jewelry is a 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.000
 A kiss for you, It's bright, and Saturday is fine too. 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.610
 It was our lady's day that appeared and the 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.270
 people are my people took the opportunity to go 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.270
 there in that too 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:37.760
 there is a Catholic church that 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:41.750
 region where we live in epsom and all 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.910
 Sunday and 76 have mass in Portuguese cinÃ© 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.710
 with a priest who, if I'm not mistaken, is 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.320
 Italian, but he does Mass in 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.900
 Portuguese and it was really cool so this is 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.080
 very much like paulo said we are the people 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.510
 could is make the decision to stay at home 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.729
 I will not stay at home that gives a 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.139
 preguicinha to leave right after the 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.060
 serious procedure i will be well 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:04.220
 sincere gives lazy to leave even though it is 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.440
 logistics but we are already 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.300
 getting into the rhythm of three 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.870
 hours to prepare for went to 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.520
 clear 14 hours down to 3 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.530
 So it was really cool, we wanted to 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.539
 know how they will behave say 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.030
 Such a situation of a Mass was not 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:22.190
 well cool the cast even liked it on 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.130
 The music hour was thus clearer. 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:27.160
 it's time enough to start getting 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.590
 in hectic neon take but not because 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.360
 he sleep he is quiet but would 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:36.349
 sitting for an hour practically 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:39.830
 it's in the cart it's asking too much so you know 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:42.860
 so antic is not accustoming with 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:46.010
 this situation nothing that accustomed 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:50.860
 since early so ah ah ah 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:52.849
 this type of environment where it is very 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.849
 but very well right 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:58.970
 and after the Mass there was a 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:02.449
 fellowship between the staff and 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:05.660
 It was really cool because William finished 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:09.280
 There is a lot of people in the 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:11.950
 parties but I did not film much because the 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.270
 and there is another one but I started to cry and I 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.100
 I thought I was a little worried that 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.750
 There was a lot of children together. 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.630
 william ran run run run 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:21.820
 ran and that's where I am in the movie because of that 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.889
 had other children together then it is 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.350
 better not eat, not knowing the 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:28.450
 People are better off not filming the 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:31.530
 Children together, so I'll just show them. 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.530
 a part and I filmed 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:42.270
 That's good, I think it's a 

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:45.599
 Great week for you, a Monday. 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:47.789
 So wonderful and what is it this week? 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:51.270
 is very very useful for 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:54.089
 It's okay, this is my friend. 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:55.259
 bye bye to the morning earring is more 

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:59.969
 interesting 

00:06:55.259 --> 00:07:04.439
 Look, do not pull yesterday against the team that 

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:08.669
 You did yesterday where you went from that 

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:10.110
 I took a bite on Daddy watching him. 

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:12.449
 I did not have with a sweatshirt I think 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.559
 take a chunk of the Brazilian and want 

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:15.689
 eat barbecue 

00:07:13.559 --> 00:07:19.379
 Are you hungry with the urge to eat? 

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:21.589
 meat is people he bit Paul yesterday that 

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:24.419
 I was sorry for the eighth stage of 

00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:31.099
 deg right poor 

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:31.099
 a giant then reaches the fish bb 

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:56.699
 shame comes and kisses kisses half flower 

00:07:51.899 --> 00:08:00.240
 Kiss the goodbye today. 

00:07:56.699 --> 00:08:02.759
 October 2011 last week made a 

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:07.050
 case of most negative pregnancy today 

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:13.159
 I bought this plug already there will suppress 

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:13.159
 It was difficult to hit the monkey's pot.
