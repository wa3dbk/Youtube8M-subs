00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.270
 then series 4 you know it there 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.919
 This is the declination of the 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.210
 series 3 the many fathers for the 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:22.520
 cuts and odd numbers for them 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.140
 sedans today bmw presents the 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.880
 wide declination of what he 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.829
 this is simply 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.910
 to add two doors and a tailgate is this 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.750
 that it changes something 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.750
 I'm told that right now 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.239
 this series four big cut mix 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.190
 a little bit the best of both worlds 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.440
 ie the muscular and massive style 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.600
 of the series 4 and the side a little more 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.730
 somewhat larger family of the series 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.960
 Especially with the arrival of his two 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.980
 doors so what can be noted is 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.690
 that the dimensions remain strictly 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.550
 the same as the back doors are 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.559
 perfectly integrated without changing the 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.440
 cut profile and all this obviously 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.300
 aims to diversify the range 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.670
 to rally customers and especially 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.589
 to come compete so far the only one 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.589
 actors of the segment the audi a5 sportback 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.090
 so in the cockpit what we can 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.890
 blame it is that the universe the board 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.300
 the orders are strictly 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.740
 the same as a series 3 we do not have 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.910
 really something exclusive that 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.440
 reflects a little sportsmanship 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.600
 it was a bit of a reproach 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.070
 had on the 4 series for the rest the 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.429
 driving position is really tip 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.440
 top 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:25.240
 which obviously changes is 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.369
 the habitability to the rear seats then 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.660
 well we have two door against it though if 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.460
 you are not tall like me 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.530
 which does not always go everywhere it's 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.240
 more contort a little bit here 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.509
 it's pretty much at the level of 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.130
 knees 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.630
 by cons at the level of the head there to 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.700
 every donkey you're going to have 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.229
 something that knocks here is the 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.819
 third passenger still badly off 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.099
 unfortunately as to the volume of 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:46.300
 chest it's 490 basic so that's 

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:48.160
 really rather not bad it's okay 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.890
 for the category the access of a radius 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.239
 naturally facilitates loading 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.440
 know also that the bench folds 

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:55.330
 two- thirds-one-third to release a 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.009
 total volume of 1300 liters so that's 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.989
 well we have a flat floor but 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.950
 I can not imagine a father with this 

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:01.690
 kind of car go to the dump 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.959
 this Sunday to throw thuyas or 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.959
 blockwork 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.480
 so welcome aboard the 4 series 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.159
 big cuts and so what strikes 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.450
 firstly it's the template of the 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:19.159
 car that is to say who and we have 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.810
 wide lanes one has an imposing car 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.060
 it's not easy in city ​​maneuvering 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.230
 and that can be a problem especially seen 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.489
 the price of the car 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.650
 so now as soon as we come out of 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.140
 the urban environment there this is where 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.940
 the car takes full meaning on 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.290
 has something super comfortable 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.849
 especially today with the chassis 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.930
 pilot we advise you to invest 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.819
 in this option 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.829
 here is a car that filters well 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.970
 imperfections it is well soundproofed 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.760
 also we are well massaged in the 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.290
 seats we're dealing more with a car 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.239
 cut for the road as for the 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.760
 attack because it reminds you 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.670
 big wheelbase we have a direction that 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.019
 is accurate but an artificial hair 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.620
 so we do not really have a feeling with 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.060
 the road 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.430
 but when you have something very 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.349
 effective that's the level of the engines on 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.840
 has diesel 4 cylinders a little basic 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.849
 up to 6 cylinders in line enough 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.530
 muscular like our trial version we have 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.590
 the 3 liters that makes 306 horses at the 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.290
 35th 'something quite how to say 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.609
 very refined fire not at all turned towards 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.799
 sportiness but something 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:18.049
 that allows you to overtake without 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.430
 problem without sweating and especially of 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.169
 to travel in a quiet place 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.750
 in a wheelchair we have something 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:24.799
 enough land to drive and that 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.250
 falls well since it is the philosophy 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.250
 of the car 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.250
 then you will have understood this series 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.890
 four large coupes mix the look 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.340
 sexy coupe with the family side of a 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.390
 sedan 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.950
 so obviously it will have to be done 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.390
 deadlock on some practical aspects 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.430
 but we have a lot 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.450
 appreciated is the space in places 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.370
 back despite a roof guard 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.620
 reduced certainly the very mechanics 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.790
 muscular chassis with little onions and 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.319
 unfortunately all this has a price 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.510
 so obviously we have an attack price 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.069
 which is rather interesting at 37 1700 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.840
 euros this with a small 4 cylinder 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.239
 diesel our test version today 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.790
 watch it hurts and at 57 thousand 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.680
 euros but ultimately this series four 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.030
 groups and has largely the arguments 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.409
 to compete with the only actress of 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.409
 segment the sportback a5
