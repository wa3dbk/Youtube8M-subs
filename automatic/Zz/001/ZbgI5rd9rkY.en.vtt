00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.270 
little bit lighter than the one I'm used
to<00:01:45.430> but<00:01:45.730> it<00:01:46.330> looks<00:01:46.540> exactly<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:47.020> same<00:01:47.280> it's

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
to but it looks exactly the same it's

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.010 
to but it looks exactly the same it's
really<00:01:48.490> exciting<00:01:48.700> to<00:01:48.970> be<00:01:49.090> a<00:01:49.120> part<00:01:49.180> of<00:01:49.540> ups

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
really exciting to be a part of ups

really exciting to be a part of ups
bring<00:01:50.290> you<00:01:50.410> this<00:01:50.560> 3d<00:01:50.890> print<00:01:51.100> technology<00:01:51.580> into

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
bring you this 3d print technology into

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.610 
bring you this 3d print technology into

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.940 
opportunities new technology will let us
print<00:02:04.060> in<00:02:04.210> more<00:02:04.390> materials<00:02:04.960> and<00:02:05.140> do<00:02:05.320> it<00:02:05.440> faster

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
print in more materials and do it faster

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.950 
print in more materials and do it faster
and<00:02:06.160> we'll<00:02:06.610> just<00:02:06.790> see<00:02:06.910> really<00:02:07.360> amazing<00:02:07.750> things

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
and we'll just see really amazing things

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.190 
and we'll just see really amazing things
I<00:02:08.080> think<00:02:09.390> there's<00:02:10.390> a<00:02:10.450> lot<00:02:10.600> of<00:02:10.630> training<00:02:10.869> AIDS

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
I think there's a lot of training AIDS

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.290 
I think there's a lot of training AIDS
in<00:02:11.380> golf<00:02:11.590> that<00:02:11.680> it<00:02:11.950> could<00:02:12.100> be<00:02:12.190> used<00:02:12.400> for<00:02:12.550> until

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
in golf that it could be used for until

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.430 
in golf that it could be used for until
you<00:02:13.450> sit<00:02:13.750> down<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:13.990> they<00:02:14.050> were<00:02:14.110> real<00:02:14.290> but

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
you sit down and they were real but

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.380 
you sit down and they were real but
think<00:02:14.650> about<00:02:14.920> it<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.190> possibilities<00:02:15.880> could

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
think about it the possibilities could

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.810 
think about it the possibilities could
be<00:02:16.510> endless
