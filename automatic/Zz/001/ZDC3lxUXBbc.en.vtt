00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
that had gone down straightaway after

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.520 
that had gone down straightaway after
just<00:02:02.040> five<00:02:02.250> minutes<00:02:02.810> so<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:03.960> was<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.110> quite<00:02:04.500> a

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
just five minutes so that was a quite a

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.800 
just five minutes so that was a quite a
bit<00:02:04.740> very<00:02:05.310> frustrating<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.880> go<00:02:06.060> down<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:06.570> early

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
bit very frustrating to go down so early

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.479 
bit very frustrating to go down so early
you<00:02:07.469> see<00:02:07.619> they're<00:02:07.799> just<00:02:07.829> some<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.220> crowd

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
you see they're just some of the crowd

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.669 
you see they're just some of the crowd
NASA's<00:02:08.849> next-gen<00:02:09.300> graphics<00:02:09.450> and

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
NASA's next-gen graphics and

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.500 
NASA's next-gen graphics and
but<00:02:10.859> from<00:02:11.039> there<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.549> kind<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:11.969> got<00:02:12.120> hold<00:02:12.359> of<00:02:12.450> the

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
but from there I kind of got hold of the

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.539 
but from there I kind of got hold of the
game<00:02:12.750> we<00:02:13.049> got<00:02:13.170> 22<00:02:13.709> minutes<00:02:13.739> in<00:02:14.159> I<00:02:14.370> get

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
game we got 22 minutes in I get

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.369 
game we got 22 minutes in I get
incredibly<00:02:15.060> lucky<00:02:15.359> being<00:02:15.540> able<00:02:15.719> to<00:02:15.810> win<00:02:16.019> and

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
incredibly lucky being able to win and

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.319 
incredibly lucky being able to win and
effectively<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.189> think<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.459> kind<00:02:17.700> of<00:02:17.819> chips<00:02:18.120> the

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
effectively I think I kind of chips the

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:19.640 
effectively I think I kind of chips the
keeper<00:02:18.689> there<00:02:18.870> which<00:02:18.989> is<00:02:19.019> a<00:02:19.140> little<00:02:19.319> where's

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
keeper there which is a little where's

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.250 
keeper there which is a little where's
the<00:02:20.549> rebounded<00:02:21.060> chip<00:02:21.329> type<00:02:21.599> thing<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:22.049> even

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
the rebounded chip type thing I even

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.229 
the rebounded chip type thing I even
sure<00:02:22.439> I<00:02:22.680> understand<00:02:23.129> what<00:02:23.280> happened<00:02:23.640> but<00:02:24.060> from

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
sure I understand what happened but from

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.759 
sure I understand what happened but from
there<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.480> started<00:02:24.659> to<00:02:25.049> kind<00:02:25.230> of<00:02:25.290> dominate<00:02:25.680> the

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
there I started to kind of dominate the

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.470 
there I started to kind of dominate the
game<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.250> we<00:02:26.370> just<00:02:26.640> grab<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.819> second<00:02:27.269> from<00:02:27.389> a

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
game and we just grab a second from a

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.690 
game and we just grab a second from a
cornice<00:02:27.900> that's<00:02:28.079> two<00:02:28.290> headers<00:02:28.530> out<00:02:29.189> of<00:02:29.519> the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
cornice that's two headers out of the

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.229 
cornice that's two headers out of the
two<00:02:30.090> work<00:02:30.269> goals<00:02:30.599> which<00:02:31.079> isn't<00:02:31.349> too<00:02:31.530> bad<00:02:31.709> and

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
two work goals which isn't too bad and

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.309 
two work goals which isn't too bad and
yeah<00:02:33.239> like<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.480> said<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:33.780> just<00:02:34.079> started

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
yeah like I said I just started

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.509 
yeah like I said I just started
dominating<00:02:34.500> from<00:02:34.980> there<00:02:35.159> we<00:02:35.280> have<00:02:35.370> another

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
dominating from there we have another

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.699 
dominating from there we have another
close<00:02:35.849> chance<00:02:36.209> in<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.510> 45th<00:02:36.959> minute<00:02:37.079> as<00:02:37.439> well

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
close chance in the 45th minute as well

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.179 
close chance in the 45th minute as well
and<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.040> think<00:02:38.639> of<00:02:38.909> 11<00:02:39.629> it<00:02:39.900> was<00:02:40.349> at<00:02:40.530> halftime<00:02:40.769> at

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
and I think of 11 it was at halftime at

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.629 
and I think of 11 it was at halftime at
11<00:02:41.909> so<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:42.750> wasn't<00:02:43.079> wasn't<00:02:43.500> was<00:02:43.859> expecting<00:02:44.519> I

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:44.639 
11 so that wasn't wasn't was expecting I

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:47.300 
11 so that wasn't wasn't was expecting I
was<00:02:44.790> forced<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.180> Tramp<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:45.689> going<00:02:46.439> 3-1<00:02:47.069> after

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
was forced to Tramp it going 3-1 after

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.990 
was forced to Tramp it going 3-1 after
just<00:02:47.760> 53<00:02:48.060> minutes<00:02:48.930> so<00:02:49.439> when<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:50.010> was<00:02:50.159> a<00:02:50.220> bit<00:02:50.400> it

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
just 53 minutes so when I was a bit it

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.179 
just 53 minutes so when I was a bit it
was<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.150> dirty<00:02:51.720> tactic<00:02:52.349> but<00:02:52.530> it<00:02:52.650> has<00:02:52.799> to<00:02:52.829> be<00:02:53.010> done

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:53.189 
was a dirty tactic but it has to be done

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:54.319 
was a dirty tactic but it has to be done
when<00:02:53.370> you're<00:02:53.489> playing<00:02:53.669> a<00:02:53.819> wager<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:54.239> would

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
when you're playing a wager you would

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.229 
when you're playing a wager you would
expect<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:55.019> and<00:02:55.200> I<00:02:55.829> asked<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.189> get<00:02:56.310> on<00:02:56.489> another

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
expect it and I asked to get on another

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.759
