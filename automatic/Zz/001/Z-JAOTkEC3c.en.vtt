00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.609
 the Hong Kong Stock Exchange 

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:14.509
 why michel 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.249
 I studied 

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:18.730
 high school to high school 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.099
 and he gave his chance to steer me laptop that he had business of 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.659
 painting and four girls and four boys 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:27.810
 I had to have it to one side is the rule 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.289
 sectors 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.160
 my father had proposed at the time 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.989
 he takes it very much to heart but surely not want to be at this business go 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.000
 allow all the time behind adil rummy 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.280
 deminor 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.740
 and for three months after the reshuffling of by my profession is 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.570
 rarely khalifa it will still be that it was absolutely not known side 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.860
 female 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.860
 and he bid in his parades saying that she would take 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.850
 I try to join the system that I continue without missed tackles 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.550
 even the very toxic that is a little bit 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.510
 hide the intrigued there it was really hard been launched for three 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.300
 month to panacea speech 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.390
 in the building and it's still next to very good casting 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.210
 it's very massive so these caps and this one 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.210
 what do women come to take our job 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.970
 did I hear very fast pans 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.610
 we're going dad 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.960
 portable evolution but maybe even in all other countries 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.400
 Europeans we are not yet in this nation side it integrates women 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.160
 but little by little 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.380
 and then it's true that he told me you're not happy we have a lot of 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.210
 women's abilities 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.530
 even when the hands on the yards same yield as in italy 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.020
 so the famous want to undermine the effort and stéphane sanchez but very 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.790
 clearly forrester women we must take what is for us 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.560
 a team he knows well 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.689
 I think a woman is accepted in a middle of men is worried 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.760
 several women in a middle of men's compassion seduction side 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.920
 the gelatin method companies 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.920
 otherwise in this country was much simpler than that 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.680
 but everything depends on the end step 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.680
 a small top of the building of the offending page so 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.090
 because it's a job 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.699
 to place the puck, but suddenly his shots 

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.979
 and then there was primal authority 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.279
 respect and the green vehicle 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:16.279
 epinal fame and the world 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:20.709
 you have to know that when you choose 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.819
 but it's up to the woman to take the step is that the woman 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.139
 not all the time either in the request for assistance 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:28.999
 I think it's a small since 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:31.549
 some women also because they are women we will benefit their 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.549
 mandates we chose a job right through to the end 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.239
 and in addition the target 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.589
 me, I do not know 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:43.769
 if a window 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.849
 17 hours 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.849
 jeans 

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:52.730
 cleaning work 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.419
 aso just like and digs 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:56.409
 a cult movie ap 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.209
 she is so complicated ministry 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.150
 I find it unfortunate that we go 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.769
 any price finish the memoirs 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.000
 it supports buyer either dexia other takers at my crossings 

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:09.999
 pedestrians do not bother to do it at the lowest 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.799
 all I hope it will become will maybe put my laptop 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.079
 still rené galinier 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.119
 the call and yellow metal benefits raised in some offices of the 

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:33.719
 footage but I worked in the office we worked out what I have to do 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:35.329
 it is safe but paper 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:36.899
 today the bill 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:40.369
 the ko was expected at t1 pm cattle were inaccurate apartment these 

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:42.399
 complaints and allow all members 

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:44.469
 we will try to do 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:47.689
 and painting and the profession that comes closest to conviction 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.739
 if you look good you do not put any color of the garment 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:56.179
 she was not any club in your house either 

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:58.439
 actually the end of everything 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:01.089
 as for its sides more 

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:03.650
 the search for harmony and sensitivity 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.650
 q will see it when we see the state in some languages 

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:09.969
 and when we are at our customers 

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:14.359
 it's up to us to see that m how this client will react the same time without 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.419
 contact friends during the vote 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.159
 we can not dead letter 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:21.519
 if they insist it's really a job culture 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.900
 his little tinker 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.330
 and she can actually we'll maybe the image of city sonics 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.849
 food that has reached its ceiling of evil 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:31.879
 impose on the united states 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:35.669
 he laid bare a balaclava what to do so it's not that it did not 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.690
 had no witness or put as a job that can be clean and workmen but 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:41.689
 usually ruled by the time m 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:43.880
 both investigations 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.770
 7:30 am and no dishonor to be apprenticed 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.039
 in France we have a real sense to his apprentice plumber the lowest 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:51.199
 indicated Sunday m 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.129
 and not to wake people 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:57.039
 but in addition to the styles somewhere between the two stop it's all of 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:58.849
 Following a job of mastering 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:01.659
 as to the fact that the economy of empty space 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:04.429
 so I have to know that I'm doing work alternately this 

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:07.249
 alternating team is the best proof 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:10.249
 training for me 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.930
 a dynamic that does not incite constantly to have the impression of being delivered before 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.509
 departure but we have this impression 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:21.509
 the fisherman and his controller because we want and in fact we did not 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:25.559
 we do not have a lot of m we have a pause-pee meditation now have 

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:27.000
 at this freedom 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.210
 very important when doing a trade
