00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.219
 Welcome to a new one here 

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.170
 follow from fifa 14 career mode with 

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:07.180
 hertha bsc and as you can see i have 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.840
 two players left out because of this 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:13.809
 fifa is against me in the Czech Republic 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.480
 the ps4 always crashed and therefore have 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.250
 I time I skipped the two game 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.160
 I'm thinking if I'm just the 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.600
 nationally easily post abgebe honest 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.590
 I think I'll give the writer 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.670
 like to comment 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.040
 I think we do not need 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.400
 That's why we're here now 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.980
 play against cologne and how it is there 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.600
 it starts when you see it 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.170
 So maybe you're leaving right up 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:42.130
 play so there it goes again into the 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.620
 play against Eintracht frankfurt already 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.090
 against the fc cologne man immediately 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.370
 Again we forget how little we play 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.590
 have the right at home against the 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.670
 to play opponents that's nice 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:01:00.120
 It can take a long time to think that they have here 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:01:04.770
 the corner ramos makes them again 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.770
 nice header but unfortunately not in it 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.540
 a lot was not missing ramos wants 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.430
 make sure to score a goal then treat 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.409
 I him him too, he must also gates 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.310
 shoot only very unsettled considered 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.390
 even if I want to play somewhere else 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.130
 have not met since three games 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.090
 Of course you have to think about it 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.130
 not easy knows the club changes 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.930
 one knows yes yes everything is yes 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.159
 many players keep coming back 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.930
 change club because they are not a goal 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.119
 have shot that easily here now 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.049
 meant ironically here at the moment 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.049
 easy starting difficulties 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.230
 we will be able to get more out of it 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.080
 next to it 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.010
 he should bale him properly 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.830
 have pressed all the time and horn 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:22.080
 is great pass there but get him 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.530
 do not celebrate but do this 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.530
 cool header 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:37.080
 yes in there is a single lead in 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.760
 against the FC Cologne plays otherwise minutes 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.530
 so comes frame from the tube so sorry 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.990
 he already wants to be the same today 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.280
 other club because not here 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.280
 we finally get the ball hello 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:05.290
 oh man it only has five minutes 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.290
 lasted bad 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.300
 So do not really look good or 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:17.420
 So final phase here was a bit 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.650
 difficult but now here comes ramos 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.120
 I want to mix that up now 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.190
 Trying is not necessarily that he 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.050
 I get played directly in the ball 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.920
 try to do things like that and 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:35.040
 Just keep me happy when he's done 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:36.270
 if he does not give it if he does 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.860
 the ball has easy and then purely 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.860
 could shoot that would be very happy 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.950
 greco 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.310
 very nice 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.239
 clean 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.960
 and in there 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.840
 the machine makes 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:11.810
 with the right foot makes gates 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.640
 or has more than that curve now 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:18.070
 I'm not active anymore 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.430
 I'm not so sure 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.490
 bam 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.920
 just before the last one has followed 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.720
 now made ten times 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.720
 to ramos has run so there times 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:38.669
 but he does the things with ok somehow 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.900
 has now really chosen 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:43.699
 Now it's going to be really awesome 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:46.699
 necessary and I would say 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:46.699
 ramos 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.480
 a bremer ramos on the other side 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:05:03.110
 somehow it does not work out that well 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:09.110
 we take time and we Greilich 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:10.470
 change from tooth to allagui 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.600
 OK 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.320
 everything alright now only has to 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.320
 change 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:24.520
 over past is the game against 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:27.380
 cologne now win times to zero 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.840
 there were some opportunities there as would 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:36.530
 we do not even have to do much more 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:40.210
 curious what is there now tells us and 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.210
 We look at the table and the goalkeeper 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.310
 ok ferryman injured so we are here 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:52.580
 at the moment at position 2 29 points 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:57.650
 bayern 31 27 scorer shave has and one 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:59.919
 message thank you for playing 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.919
 could 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.560
 So the monthly scouting update is here 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:20.070
 So definitely reject the one here 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:25.260
 here is still observed and have it 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:26.880
 watch more press conference motivate 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.720
 then we were curious, we were ours 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.940
 first good player will find until 80 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.310
 talent is not bad either 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.720
 That's right 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:41.370
 but we really want it 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:42.200
 thick fish with between 74 and 90 70 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.460
 90 103 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.470
 and we have come here message 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.450
 I can not get people like him 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.920
 open to be so they know 

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.450
 what's inside you going to try that 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.400
 to concentrate football but that is 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.570
 not easy when you feel homesick, too 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.350
 Lick me, you do not have one now 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:59.790
 homesick I 'm on training 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.020
 let's concentrate around then 

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.700
 see for me is the most important 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.730
 continue to do a good job for you and 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:07.230
 to do the team 

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.420
 let's see if he gates now 

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:13.240
 he should shoot soon, too 

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:16.190
 probably no homesick moments have 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.260
 there's just as good here first the 

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:20.230
 saved we'll see you at 

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:23.230
 So next time , that's good 

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:23.230
 whiskey
