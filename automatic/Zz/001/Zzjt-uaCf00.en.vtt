what<00:00:49.320> spider<00:00:49.649> Gwen<00:00:49.980> will<00:00:50.309> look<00:00:50.520> like<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:51.239> my

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
what spider Gwen will look like in my

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.720 
what spider Gwen will look like in my
opinion<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.199> Kim<00:00:52.410> probably<00:00:52.829> be<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.100> same<00:00:53.399> as

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
opinion is Kim probably be the same as

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.760 
opinion is Kim probably be the same as
spider-man<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.600> all<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.840> web<00:00:55.020> shots<00:00:55.410> and

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
spider-man and all the web shots and

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.920 
spider-man and all the web shots and
then<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.980> cake<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.520> then<00:00:56.610> I'm<00:00:57.449> pretty<00:00:57.750> sure

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
then the cake and then I'm pretty sure

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.630 
then the cake and then I'm pretty sure
that<00:00:58.109> she<00:00:58.350> can<00:00:58.559> probably<00:00:58.739> do<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.129> same<00:00:59.190> stuff

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
that she can probably do the same stuff

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.580 
that she can probably do the same stuff
just<00:01:00.090> like<00:01:00.239> black<00:01:00.539> spider-man<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.440> can

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
just like black spider-man you can

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.179 
just like black spider-man you can
anticipate<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:03.080> wow<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.110> guess<00:01:04.589> if<00:01:05.040> you

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
and they just basically change the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.429 
and they just basically change the
outside<00:02:13.670> where<00:02:13.939> it<00:02:13.999> looks<00:02:14.180> like<00:02:14.269> the<00:02:14.569> stuff<00:02:15.260> on

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:15.439

outside where it looks like the stuff on
the<00:02:15.530> inside<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:16.069> moves<00:02:16.310> are<00:02:16.609> essentially<00:02:17.510> the

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
the inside the moves are essentially the

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.720
