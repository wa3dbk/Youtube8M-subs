00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
it's pretty much only gonna be a head

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.550 
it's pretty much only gonna be a head
there's<00:00:15.540> nothing<00:00:15.929> else<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.170> could<00:00:16.260> be<00:00:16.289> except

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560

there's nothing else it could be except
the<00:00:16.650> head<00:00:16.800> in<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:16.980> connector<00:00:17.369> uh<00:00:17.960> this<00:00:18.960> piece

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
the head in the connector uh this piece

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.859 
the head in the connector uh this piece
the<00:00:19.980> tricera<00:00:20.820> shield<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.210> actually<00:00:21.600> I

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
the tricera shield is actually I

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.519 
the tricera shield is actually I
actually<00:00:22.529> think<00:00:22.710> it's<00:00:22.859> kind<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.130> cool<00:00:23.369> piece

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
actually think it's kind of a cool piece

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.120 
actually think it's kind of a cool piece
it<00:00:25.529> just<00:00:25.590> needs<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:25.920> find<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.609> right<00:00:26.820> place

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
it just needs to find the right place

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.679 
it just needs to find the right place
for<00:00:29.130> example<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.880> can<00:00:30.000> attach<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.539> back

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
for example you can attach to the back

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.690 
for example you can attach to the back
to<00:00:30.869> move<00:00:30.990> annoyed<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.439> put<00:00:32.189> these<00:00:32.279> around<00:00:32.430> its

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
to move annoyed and put these around its

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.139 
to move annoyed and put these around its
like<00:00:32.790> shoulder<00:00:33.149> cannons<00:00:33.649> which<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.940> not<00:00:35.940> bad

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
like shoulder cannons which is not bad

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.600 
like shoulder cannons which is not bad
um<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.350> can<00:00:37.469> attach<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> arm<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.460> it

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
um you can attach it to the arm and it

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.020 
um you can attach it to the arm and it
can<00:00:38.730> be<00:00:39.230> like<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.260> shield<00:00:40.860> with<00:00:41.190> both<00:00:41.610> cannons

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
can be like a shield with both cannons

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.740 
can be like a shield with both cannons
or<00:00:42.860> there's<00:00:43.860> some<00:00:44.010> things<00:00:44.360> not<00:00:45.360> really<00:00:45.570> sure

it<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.320> just<00:01:49.380> slap<00:01:49.799> on<00:01:50.040> your<00:01:51.680> your<00:01:52.680> dinosaur

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
it you just slap on your your dinosaur

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.780 
it you just slap on your your dinosaur
head<00:01:53.220> one<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.210> one<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.509> two<00:01:54.570> dinosaur<00:01:55.020> heads

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.950 

this<00:01:59.790> piece<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.180> not<00:02:00.210> really<00:02:00.600> very<00:02:01.590> good<00:02:01.740> for

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
this piece is not really very good for

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.060 
this piece is not really very good for
you<00:02:03.960> know<00:02:04.079> much<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.259> anything<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.710> can<00:02:04.860> clip

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
you know much of anything you can clip

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.219 
you know much of anything you can clip
it<00:02:05.159> on<00:02:05.280> here<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.210> only<00:02:06.420> has<00:02:06.630> one<00:02:06.659> hole<00:02:07.049> there

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
it on here it only has one hole there

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.869 
it on here it only has one hole there
which<00:02:07.429> kinda<00:02:08.429> sucks

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
which kinda sucks

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.510 
which kinda sucks
I<00:02:09.090> mean<00:02:09.390> it's

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
I mean it's

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.220 
I mean it's
when<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.210> fold<00:02:12.390> out<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.660> head<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:12.930> can<00:02:13.050> kind

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
when you fold out the head you can kind

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.930 
when you fold out the head you can kind
of<00:02:13.290> see<00:02:13.470> it<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.590> little<00:02:13.740> more<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.130> it's<00:02:14.280> almost<00:02:14.700> a

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
of see it a little more so it's almost a

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.660 
of see it a little more so it's almost a
little<00:02:14.970> hidden<00:02:15.480> but<00:02:15.710> not<00:02:16.710> enough<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.160> it's<00:02:17.520> not

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
little hidden but not enough I it's not

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.420 
little hidden but not enough I it's not
really<00:02:17.910> a<00:02:18.260> you<00:02:19.260> can<00:02:19.410> do<00:02:19.830> that<00:02:20.040> if<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:20.190> want

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
really a you can do that if you want

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.170 
really a you can do that if you want
it's<00:02:20.760> not<00:02:20.910> really<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.180> wonderful<00:02:21.420> piece<00:02:23.180> and

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
it's not really a wonderful piece and

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.670 
it's not really a wonderful piece and
the<00:02:24.270> like<00:02:24.420> pieces<00:02:24.810> these<00:02:25.140> are<00:02:25.200> actually<00:02:25.530> kind

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
the like pieces these are actually kind

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.720 
the like pieces these are actually kind
of<00:02:25.710> interesting<00:02:26.040> because<00:02:26.130> they<00:02:26.340> have<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.490> peg

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
of interesting because they have a peg

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.880 
of interesting because they have a peg
here<00:02:26.970> which<00:02:27.120> comes<00:02:27.900> out<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.380> then<00:02:28.650> folds<00:02:28.950> over

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
here which comes out and then folds over

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.740 
here which comes out and then folds over
so<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:31.980> peg<00:02:32.100> can<00:02:32.250> be<00:02:32.340> either<00:02:32.430> on<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.700> back<00:02:32.880> or

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
so the peg can be either on the back or

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.780 
so the peg can be either on the back or
on<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.900> side<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.860> has<00:02:34.890> these<00:02:35.160> slots<00:02:35.520> here

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
on the side and it has these slots here

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.550 
on the side and it has these slots here
which<00:02:37.430> peg<00:02:38.430> fits<00:02:38.640> loosely<00:02:38.790> here<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.300> then

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
which peg fits loosely here and then

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.730 
which peg fits loosely here and then
slides<00:02:40.560> over<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:41.340> lock<00:02:41.700> in<00:02:41.850> place<00:02:41.880> I<00:02:42.300> think

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.030 

fairly<00:02:46.740> sure<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:49.560> good<00:02:49.650> thing<00:02:49.770> about<00:02:49.860> this

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
fairly sure the good thing about this

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.420 
fairly sure the good thing about this
piece<00:02:50.250> is<00:02:50.520> that<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.300> hole<00:02:51.570> here<00:02:51.930> is<00:02:52.340> just<00:02:53.340> the

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
piece is that this hole here is just the

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.610 
piece is that this hole here is just the
width<00:02:53.580> of<00:02:53.700> like<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.060> legs<00:02:54.270> and<00:02:54.390> arms<00:02:54.570> so<00:02:55.530> when

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
width of like the legs and arms so when

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.980 
width of like the legs and arms so when
you<00:02:55.710> put<00:02:55.830> it<00:02:55.920> on<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.160> all<00:02:56.370> fits<00:02:56.610> together

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
you put it on it all fits together

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.820 
you put it on it all fits together
wonderfully<00:02:57.990> and<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.320> could<00:02:58.440> use<00:02:58.620> these<00:02:58.770> as

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
wonderfully and you could use these as

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:07.300 
wonderfully and you could use these as
like<00:03:04.700> like<00:03:05.700> super<00:03:06.000> robot<00:03:06.420> legs<00:03:06.660> or<00:03:06.900> something

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
like like super robot legs or something

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.590 
like like super robot legs or something
these<00:03:08.310> pieces<00:03:08.550> don't<00:03:08.790> really<00:03:09.000> have<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.390> lot<00:03:09.570> of

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
these pieces don't really have a lot of

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.030 
these pieces don't really have a lot of
use<00:03:09.870> just<00:03:10.140> because<00:03:10.230> of<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.500> way<00:03:10.590> they're<00:03:10.740> cut

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
use just because of the way they're cut

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.040 
use just because of the way they're cut
to<00:03:11.220> fit<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.400> tricep<00:03:11.850> it<00:03:12.030> have<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.570> flip-out<00:03:12.810> peg

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
to fit the tricep it have a flip-out peg

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.320 
to fit the tricep it have a flip-out peg
here<00:03:13.380> and<00:03:13.560> this<00:03:14.250> one<00:03:14.430> is<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.670> one<00:03:14.790> peg<00:03:15.030> that<00:03:15.270> I

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
here and this one is the one peg that I

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.990 
here and this one is the one peg that I
don't<00:03:15.630> know<00:03:15.840> where<00:03:16.680> it's<00:03:16.830> used<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.280> don't<00:03:17.460> it

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
don't know where it's used I don't it

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.670 
don't know where it's used I don't it
doesn't<00:03:18.240> seem<00:03:18.390> like<00:03:18.510> it's<00:03:18.660> used<00:03:18.840> in<00:03:19.020> the<00:03:19.050> in

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
doesn't seem like it's used in the in

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.870 
doesn't seem like it's used in the in
the<00:03:19.830> combinations<00:03:20.400> with<00:03:20.660> galaxy<00:03:21.660> Rex<00:03:22.880> these

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
the combinations with galaxy Rex these

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.570 
the combinations with galaxy Rex these
are<00:03:24.060> basically<00:03:24.690> just<00:03:24.750> pieces<00:03:25.230> that<00:03:25.460> you<00:03:26.460> know

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
are basically just pieces that you know

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.830 
are basically just pieces that you know
just<00:03:26.820> put<00:03:27.000> some<00:03:27.180> ready<00:03:27.360> to<00:03:27.420> get<00:03:27.540> them<00:03:27.630> out<00:03:27.750> of

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
just put some ready to get them out of

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.980 
just put some ready to get them out of
the<00:03:27.900> way<00:03:28.080> just<00:03:28.440> for<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.370> sake<00:03:29.610> of<00:03:29.990> having

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
the way just for the sake of having

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.520 
the way just for the sake of having
everything<00:03:31.500> there<00:03:32.990> now<00:03:33.990> he<00:03:34.110> does<00:03:34.260> combine

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
everything there now he does combine

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.460 
everything there now he does combine
with<00:03:34.710> galaxy<00:03:35.130> Rex<00:03:35.340> uh-huh<00:03:35.760> he<00:03:35.970> uses<00:03:36.270> this<00:03:37.200> head

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
with galaxy Rex uh-huh he uses this head

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.950 
with galaxy Rex uh-huh he uses this head
to<00:03:37.860> form<00:03:38.160> a<00:03:39.000> big<00:03:39.450> rocky<00:03:39.720> sore<00:03:40.310> which<00:03:41.810> has<00:03:42.810> some

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960 
to form a big rocky sore which has some

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.420 
to form a big rocky sore which has some
things<00:03:43.140> I<00:03:43.230> don't<00:03:43.290> like<00:03:43.440> about<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:43.830> but<00:03:44.040> it's

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
things I don't like about it but it's

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
things I don't like about it but it's
cool<00:03:44.610> to<00:03:44.730> dinosaur<00:03:45.300> and<00:03:45.990> then<00:03:46.710> he<00:03:47.010> uses<00:03:47.450> this

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
cool to dinosaur and then he uses this

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.110 
cool to dinosaur and then he uses this
head<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:49.680> form<00:03:49.920> of<00:03:50.340> course<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.760> Super<00:03:51.000> Robot

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
head the form of course the Super Robot

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.000 
head the form of course the Super Robot
and<00:03:51.450> I'll<00:03:51.510> show<00:03:51.690> you<00:03:51.720> of<00:03:51.960> an<00:03:52.170> imitation<00:03:52.650> of

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
and I'll show you of an imitation of

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.390 
and I'll show you of an imitation of
that<00:03:53.070> with<00:03:53.970> dick<00:03:54.210> Kong<00:03:55.010> this<00:03:56.010> is<00:03:56.130> something

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
that with dick Kong this is something

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.950 
that with dick Kong this is something
similar<00:03:56.730> like<00:03:56.940> what<00:03:57.090> happens<00:03:57.330> the<00:03:57.420> galaxy<00:03:57.780> Rex
