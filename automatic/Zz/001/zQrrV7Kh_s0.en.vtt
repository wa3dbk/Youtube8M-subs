00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.809
 very good that such I am tactic vÃ­ctor and 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.270
 well here I bring you another tac tic threesome 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.869
 in Coliseum that the truth is that it has been 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:19.449
 a little weird because it seemed easy but 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.949
 it has taken some scares and they have 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.810
 been playing also with my glyphs 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.080
 because as you can see there is a panda a cat and 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.510
 an okra is worth the beginning I thought that 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.180
 I had to go from a distance but I take it out because 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.480
 I think so if the panda is far away 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.309
 and he and the cat have good reach and 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.710
 they can also defend themselves from far away 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.150
 well then I thought I had to 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.829
 go far but good I have stayed for 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.530
 back here thinking they're going to kill me 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:47.140
 the con man of one with only two screws 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.900
 the crook of life crook is already 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.940
 well I'm going to stay here from the back 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.470
 and good to wait for the guardian is 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.910
 the 3 when the guardian until 3 and 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.830
 I could move and I could do what I 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.230
 want because you will have a very very defense 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.880
 What is what I always do? 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.340
 so good to just get ready 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.930
 all the guardian the bomb that by 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.060
 luck this time has given him with remission 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.040
 there are times I do two harquebuses and the 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.560
 bomb and by not referring the truth 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.690
 is that he finished quite a bit and well we are 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.510
 going to sack for the cat that we know that 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.830
 is the one who even wants to make an offense 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.680
 as bigger you will have to approach 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.380
 plus 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.630
 and so that it approaches as it dies and 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.520
 As you can see, he is also going to sack 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.920
 the con man know that he is the pillar of my 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.660
 strategy and good here he left it a little 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.729
 discovered but when descending he fears 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.740
 put the pump and how it has the torque and 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.270
 can not come to sack for me 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.930
 does not do much to me then either 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.670
 We were almost killing the cat and 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.080
 kickback he thought he was going to 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.720
 do your 3 will search but it is done 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.320
 kickback then with the put a 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.790
 tried to cover the scammer as much as he could 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.800
 that now will touch the bread of mela 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.020
 could also get involved with tactics and 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.509
 I do two things expose the 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.850
 cat and make the panda not not 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.060
 mess it up so much here it digs a hole 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.470
 miraculous there between nowhere and the support 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.950
 quite since with the panda I say 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.270
 as in what takes advantage of the same hole 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.480
 I'm going to finish it then I put the panda 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.580
 put there and so I protect myself and go to 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.590
 I sack for the cat I dishonor and 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.720
 so you give him counterattack spell which is what 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.810
 that gives him so much vitality and that's what 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.250
 I can kill here he plays me because with 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.350
 dispersion gets me into glyph 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.610
 but then I do not know why it kills bombs like that 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.370
 that does not worry me either 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.040
 ma removed little life and eye that are me 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.230
 killing the con man here with the nonsense 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.740
 and well I had to play yes or yes 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.230
 here to try to kill him because if he does not 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.410
 killed he killed me and I get it 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.300
 between the vitality that he had against 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.520
 hit and the bombs, I can kill him 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.650
 now on top the game in until 3 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.860
 so I can already cure the 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.170
 scammer as you see so much more than 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.750
 1000 per turn and you'll see when it's 20 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.730
 that you have one level already attentive 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.290
 I do not know how it will go because it will have less life 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.660
 and maybe it loads very fast but 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.480
 But hey, it will cure more what it is that 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.370
 interests and will also hit more then 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.290
 here I was looking to see if I could get 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.480
 the panda in some way but I do not get 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.520
 I say good I put the bomb and either 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.090
 the next turn of the scammer already does what 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.100
 I want here because it was pretty 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.680
 wait without using the panda because I 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.020
 I was interested in the scammer I know it was 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.840
 stay on top of the panda that is like a 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.070
 kind of sacrifice and so the okra that 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.480
 is touching him now, why not? 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.940
 can roll and can not kill me 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.970
 no way was I thinking about poking 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.560
 to the panda but as it has tranca and tal and 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.840
 It is farther away because I say let's go for it 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.209
 okra that is here next and it seems that 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.220
 it's easier and good I'm going back 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.540
 because I have the guardian and I have many 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.910
 walls between the pumps the 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.880
 invocations and all this because the truth 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.110
 is that it's there I'm pretty covered 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.730
 and good to heal it has been said that he 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.980
 estimate the truth is that it has very good 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.920
 offensive but I'm more interested in cure 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.500
 what you see is that I love to see 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.880
 as a cure so seriously although there is a 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.090
 which I do not like at all 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.580
 guardian and is that 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.090
 a gotti mature as you are looking for and 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:13.000
 puts to cure the guardian and the doubles 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.590
 false the subject of the con artist and how 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.889
 you see here the panda keeps sending me 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.959
 that removes the vessel and manages to get my 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.360
 estimate and I say good as I am another 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.010
 panda I take it out and I will not complicate it 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.470
 I'm going to give ingrained status with 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.449
 stabilization and so can not move me and 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.000
 he can not put me in glyph, he believes it 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.680
 so they do not bother me more then now 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.020
 it seems that they wanted to go to sack for him 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.150
 steamer but still hold is far is 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.740
 all right 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.840
 and now comes the scammer's turn 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.280
 I was thinking of simple to make it simple 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.320
 kill him crash they already have little life 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.630
 but I say good he thinks he can 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.900
 kill the steam and more if he touched a 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.240
 little bit and now I put the panda in 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.680
 glyph that I do not think the truth is 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.660
 that I was really scared there 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.110
 the panda's Liara me there so close 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.840
 of the glyph so close to everything but it 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.969
 a combo takes place here and I lock the panda 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.699
 so that 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:07.619
 so if you want to do something you will have 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:09.269
 I have to wait a bit but I have not thought 

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:12.569
 that he is a fucking panda and that he can catch 

00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:14.849
 the bomb and leave so pancha here but 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:17.969
 well he's already half dead 1800 of life 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:20.639
 so whatever he does he does not have 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:24.209
 nothing does not escape you now it's your turn 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:26.339
 to my panda that as not a as well 

00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:28.529
 simple I pick it up and threw it inside team 

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:30.149
 and that's it although it did not take away his life because 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:32.069
 I had already activated in live before with this 

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:34.139
 in the cold I will always remember it with a 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:36.269
 last breath and a little kick takes him 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.039
 removed what is needed and good that 

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:40.019
 I hope you liked this video 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:45.839
 As you can see, it was somewhat uneven 

00:05:40.019 --> 00:05:47.330
 they were the three was 299 and a 196 wafer or 

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:49.099
 be 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.470
 I have noticed that in this video I have spoken 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:53.509
 so more quickly fluid without clogging 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.240
 less good will be because the coliseum what 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:57.349
 I just did not know anything that I hope that 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.240
 you liked the video the former favorite 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:00.800
 subscribed if you like all my videos 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.240
 commented what did you think 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.680
 remember that I have a facebook in which 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.479
 always notice when videos come 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.139
 so I'm not looking and nothing that we 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:08.139
 we see in the next
