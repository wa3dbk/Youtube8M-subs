00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.740
 a starless planet has been discovered 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.259
 thanks to the observations made 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.610
 telescope canada france hawai and at 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.539
 telescope of the European observatory 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.710
 austral there was no moment of eureka 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.660
 we found a floating window 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.980
 nobody came out naked of his wine 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.410
 in the street shouting and rigor as 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.390
 archimedes and enter not that I know 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.369
 and it's a process that's 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.869
 relatively long actually like like 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.620
 discovery process is not of a 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.660
 stand illuminations sion there we have the beast 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:41.820
 the beast carries the acronym very poetic 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.290
 of cfbdsir1458 will have taken almost two 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.780
 years of analysis by the research team 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.940
 on the sample pick up to get to 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.980
 determine the age and mass of this 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.640
 floating planet 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.320
 obviously it's always a question 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.360
 of the definition question is what 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.680
 you were necessarily in orbit 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.000
 around a star they are an object 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.609
 that the same mask a planet that is 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.250
 a sphere of gas that on the see of 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.840
 nearby would look like jupiter the 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.860
 the object alone so it must be detected 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.200
 because he still loved light 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.390
 infrared formed roughly there 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.770
 60 million years old forming and in 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.180
 a certain amount of energy he was 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.380
 hot and the ex had cooled 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.119
 so we see it is master actually 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.280
 this residual heat worst of these 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.049
 news 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.880
 this heat emitted and the absence of 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.610
 canvases near an object will allow 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.840
 gather more information because 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.710
 that starred in his very bright 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.990
 mermaid stars 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.159
 next to that object she surprises 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.420
 less visible canvases they would 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.380
 aimed with a pair of binoculars are 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.799
 maybe even a star is visible to 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.740
 the naked eye so a lot of light and 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.780
 that makes the observation of the object that 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.400
 is right next door extremely 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.009
 difficult and in the background we can get 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.360
 ask if this object has formed around 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.520
 of a story a bit like the system 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.049
 solar we have our sun 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.000
 we have the planets that revolve around 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.710
 of the sun one may wonder if this 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.509
 object quite shaped the same way or 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.820
 well is it really formed 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.640
 from a cloud of gas is therefore 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.350
 collapsed we had a planet so at 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.870
 this time we must ask it 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.970
 said 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.310
 which of the two scenarios and the most 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.290
 plausible so this discovery their 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.690
 brings a possibility that is unique 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.700
 to go and study in detail the chemistry 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.170
 the atmosphere of a planet from 4.4 to 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.820
 this time the mass of jupiter that 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.030
 could be used to understand after that 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.750
 all alone that we discover around you 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.700
 in the neighborhood 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.380
 this discovery is the result of a 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.640
 collaboration between the University of 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.620
 Montreal and the laboratory 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.650
 Astrophysics Observatory
