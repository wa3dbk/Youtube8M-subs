all<00:00:04.279> right<00:00:04.460> I'm<00:00:04.700> gonna<00:00:04.880> run<00:00:05.060> this<00:00:05.300> up<00:00:05.540> and

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:06.580 
all right I'm gonna run this up and

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.920 
all right I'm gonna run this up and
we'll<00:00:07.580> see<00:00:07.879> I'm<00:00:08.000> gonna<00:00:08.090> running<00:00:08.299> up<00:00:08.450> on<00:00:08.570> ten

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:08.930 
we'll see I'm gonna running up on ten

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:37.990 
we'll see I'm gonna running up on ten
ass<00:00:09.110> so<00:00:10.100> let's<00:00:10.370> see<00:00:10.610> what<00:00:10.760> she<00:00:10.910> does

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.820 

real<00:00:39.000> nice<00:00:39.240> and<00:00:39.450> smooth<00:00:39.750> let's<00:00:40.380> see<00:00:40.590> what<00:00:40.710> the

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:40.830 
real nice and smooth let's see what the

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:47.180 
real nice and smooth let's see what the
meter<00:00:41.040> says<00:00:42.140> 2600<00:00:43.140> watts<00:00:43.790> at<00:00:45.770> the<00:00:46.770> stake<00:00:47.160> oh

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
meter says 2600 watts at the stake oh

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.960 
meter says 2600 watts at the stake oh
look<00:00:47.490> here's<00:00:47.760> like<00:00:48.150> you<00:00:48.240> get<00:00:48.360> this<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.720> focus

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
look here's like you get this the focus

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:57.790 
look here's like you get this the focus
you<00:00:50.970> see

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:04.160 

69<00:00:58.800> amps<00:01:01.010> 2600<00:01:02.010> watts<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.970> that's<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.180> 900<00:01:03.780> kV

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
69 amps 2600 watts so that's a 900 kV

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.190 
69 amps 2600 watts so that's a 900 kV
motor<00:01:05.150> let's<00:01:06.150> see<00:01:06.300> what<00:01:06.420> kind<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.630> thrust<00:01:06.930> it

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
motor let's see what kind of thrust it

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
motor let's see what kind of thrust it
gives<00:01:07.700> this<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.910> just<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.210> little<00:01:10.340> primitive

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
gives this is just a little primitive

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.170 
gives this is just a little primitive

hope I can get it in five eight pounds
of<00:01:21.479> thrust<00:01:25.880> see<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.060> all<00:01:27.509> right<00:01:27.690> let's<00:01:27.840> give

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
of thrust see that all right let's give

00:01:28.020 --> 00:02:08.219 
of thrust see that all right let's give
it<00:01:28.050> a<00:01:28.170> try

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.030 

well<00:02:09.229> I'd<00:02:09.440> say<00:02:09.770> a<00:02:10.870> thousand<00:02:11.870> kV<00:02:12.320> motor<00:02:12.590> be<00:02:12.890> the

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
well I'd say a thousand kV motor be the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
well I'd say a thousand kV motor be the
trick<00:02:13.750> on<00:02:14.750> a-10s<00:02:15.110> system<00:02:15.770> I<00:02:15.980> want<00:02:16.610> about<00:02:16.670> three

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
trick on a-10s system I want about three

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.660 
trick on a-10s system I want about three
thousand<00:02:17.540> watts<00:02:17.750> just<00:02:18.710> so<00:02:18.860> it's<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.160> low<00:02:19.370> amp

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
thousand watts just so it's a low amp

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.780 
thousand watts just so it's a low amp

heatsink on that motor whoo I have a

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.100 
heatsink on that motor whoo I have a
little<00:02:37.430> heat<00:02:38.300> gauge<00:02:38.570> let's<00:02:38.870> see<00:02:38.959> what<00:02:39.080> that

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
little heat gauge let's see what that

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.430 
little heat gauge let's see what that
motors<00:02:39.560> that<00:02:39.790> after<00:02:40.790> that<00:02:40.970> run<00:02:44.050> now

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
motors that after that run now

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.800 
motors that after that run now
it<00:02:45.740> was<00:02:45.920> cold<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.490> motor<00:02:46.700> was<00:02:46.880> about<00:02:47.120> 62

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
it was cold the motor was about 62

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.830 
it was cold the motor was about 62
degrees<00:02:48.200> when<00:02:48.590> I<00:02:48.709> started<00:02:49.190> so<00:02:49.850> 67<00:02:50.840> 20<00:02:51.080> degrees

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
degrees when I started so 67 20 degrees

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.330 
degrees when I started so 67 20 degrees
that's<00:02:53.840> all<00:02:54.140> went<00:02:54.440> up<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.680> suit<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.070> speed

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
that's all went up to suit the speed

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.140 
that's all went up to suit the speed
control<00:02:55.760> this<00:02:55.910> is<00:02:56.000> an<00:02:56.060> HP<00:02:56.450> 110<00:02:57.459> hmm<00:02:58.520> speed

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
control this is an HP 110 hmm speed

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.150 
control this is an HP 110 hmm speed
control<00:02:59.800> now<00:03:00.800> it<00:03:01.010> is<00:03:01.190> here<00:03:01.880> I'll<00:03:02.180> get<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.480> wood

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
control now it is here I'll get the wood

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.920 
control now it is here I'll get the wood
that's<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.430> wood<00:03:04.640> so<00:03:05.060> that's<00:03:05.570> about<00:03:05.810> the

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
that's the wood so that's about the

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.720 
that's the wood so that's about the
temperature<00:03:06.380> in<00:03:06.500> here<00:03:06.530> here's<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.250> batteries

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
temperature in here here's the batteries

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.350 
temperature in here here's the batteries
those<00:03:08.510> are<00:03:08.690> XPS<00:03:09.489> batteries<00:03:10.489> were<00:03:10.670> at<00:03:10.790> 72

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
those are XPS batteries were at 72

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.610 
those are XPS batteries were at 72
degrees<00:03:11.780> those<00:03:12.500> are<00:03:12.680> XPS<00:03:13.360> 5000<00:03:14.360> 10<00:03:14.870> 10<00:03:15.260> cells

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
degrees those are XPS 5000 10 10 cells

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.500 
degrees those are XPS 5000 10 10 cells
and<00:03:16.400> those<00:03:16.580> are<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.790> 65<00:03:17.420> C<00:03:17.810> batteries<00:03:18.340> so

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
and those are the 65 C batteries so

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.759 
and those are the 65 C batteries so
that's<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:21.340> shang<00:03:22.340> tsung<00:03:23.350> fan<00:03:24.350> with<00:03:24.739> a

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
that's the the shang tsung fan with a

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.650 
that's the the shang tsung fan with a
new<00:03:25.010> c<00:03:25.280> i<00:03:25.310> redesigned<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:25.970> hob<00:03:26.150> on<00:03:26.180> it

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
new c i redesigned the hob on it

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.050 
new c i redesigned the hob on it
the<00:03:26.959> hub<00:03:27.200> was<00:03:27.440> really<00:03:27.890> bad<00:03:28.130> on<00:03:28.459> it<00:03:28.670> so<00:03:29.030> i

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
the hub was really bad on it so i

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.110 
the hub was really bad on it so i
redesigned<00:03:29.840> a<00:03:30.080> new<00:03:30.230> hub<00:03:30.470> for<00:03:30.709> it<00:03:30.890> so<00:03:31.220> well<00:03:31.970> that

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
redesigned a new hub for it so well that

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.000 
redesigned a new hub for it so well that
was<00:03:32.239> really<00:03:32.630> the<00:03:32.750> first<00:03:32.930> run<00:03:33.260> up<00:03:33.440> on<00:03:33.650> it<00:03:33.860> and<00:03:33.920> it

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
was really the first run up on it and it

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.920 
was really the first run up on it and it
was<00:03:34.220> silky<00:03:34.640> smooth<00:03:35.090> I<00:03:35.209> put<00:03:35.360> my<00:03:35.480> fingernail<00:03:35.870> on

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
was silky smooth I put my fingernail on

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.350 
was silky smooth I put my fingernail on
the<00:03:36.170> back<00:03:36.350> of<00:03:36.560> it<00:03:36.709> and<00:03:37.010> it<00:03:37.459> was<00:03:37.940> nice<00:03:38.150> and

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
the back of it and it was nice and

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.060 
the back of it and it was nice and
smooth<00:03:38.690> so<00:03:38.989> I<00:03:39.019> think<00:03:39.170> I<00:03:39.410> can<00:03:39.590> push<00:03:39.799> it<00:03:39.950> I'm

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
smooth so I think I can push it I'm
