00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
damage right here in the front but

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.120 
damage right here in the front but
that's<00:00:33.329> common<00:00:33.660> with<00:00:34.380> these<00:00:34.500> machines<00:00:34.710> it's

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
that's common with these machines it's

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.470 
that's common with these machines it's
actually<00:00:35.399> not<00:00:35.520> torn<00:00:35.820> off<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.329> really

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
actually not torn off it's in really

actually not torn off it's in really
good<00:00:36.660> condition<00:00:36.840> considering<00:00:38.870> the<00:00:39.870> controls

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
good condition considering the controls

good condition considering the controls
on<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.910> side<00:00:42.180> all<00:00:42.960> work<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.649> handles<00:00:44.010> are

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
on this side all work the handles are

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.900 
on this side all work the handles are
still<00:00:44.399> there<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:46.160> turn<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.250> machine<00:00:47.489> on<00:00:47.640> like

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
still there and turn the machine on like

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.480 
still there and turn the machine on like
this

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:50.490 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.330 

this<00:00:51.030> part<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.570> what<00:00:51.750> beats<00:00:51.990> the<00:00:52.140> tennis<00:00:53.100> balls

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
this part is what beats the tennis balls

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.480 
this part is what beats the tennis balls
in<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.760> will<00:00:53.880> hold<00:00:54.030> 225<00:00:54.930> tennis<00:00:55.350> balls<00:00:55.560> not

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
just rotates and you can change the the

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.100 
just rotates and you can change the the
speed<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.730> that<00:00:59.880> the<00:01:00.150> interval<00:01:00.540> in<00:01:00.720> which<00:01:00.750> it

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
speed of that the interval in which it

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.800 
speed of that the interval in which it
delivers<00:01:01.950> the<00:01:01.980> tennis<00:01:02.460> balls<00:01:02.700> and<00:01:03.270> also<00:01:03.660> the

delivers the tennis balls and also the

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.010 
delivers the tennis balls and also the
speed<00:01:04.140> anywhere<00:01:04.920> from<00:01:05.250> 5<00:01:05.550> to<00:01:05.580> 95<00:01:06.480> miles<00:01:06.750> an

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.180 
speed anywhere from 5 to 95 miles an
hour<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.980> then<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:09.510> also<00:01:09.690> has<00:01:10.190> facilitation

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
hour and then it also has facilitation

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.330 
hour and then it also has facilitation
adjustments<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.990> then<00:01:13.710> elevation

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
adjustments on and then elevation

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.370 
adjustments on and then elevation
adjustments<00:01:15.710> you<00:01:16.710> can<00:01:17.190> see<00:01:17.370> the<00:01:18.380> pitching
