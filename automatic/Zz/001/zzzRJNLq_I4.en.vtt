 German cinemas tell the story 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.740
 by ron wood wolf played by matthew 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.470
 mcconaughey a man of the 1980's 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.230
 cowboy is in southern states in the us 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.270
 First of the type of rodeo the gay loves 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.190
 hate the fagots despise that is 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.930
 his own word choice not mine though 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.760
 a man after an accident in the 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.280
 hospital gets operated on that he 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.110
 hiv-positive is in a time in the man 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.970
 not really about this disease yet 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.950
 all too much and above all the whole 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.960
 with south hostile homophon 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.090
 prejudice peppered finds itself ron 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.790
 again in a world of it for him 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.920
 it is still 30 days to live, he had 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.900
 Of course everyone is thinking of trying 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.180
 fashion a drug accessory 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.400
 to come to this die 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.690
 delay as far as it goes 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.460
 but then he learns all this way 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.290
 but the one or two people from 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.180
 other shore specifically know one 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.400
 transsexual played by jared leto 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.900
 and that's great now 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.880
 not in vain with the golden globe below 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.260
 have been awarded for this and other 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.450
 a friendship resulting from it 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.920
 a partnership that starts one 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.870
 to build up type of smuggling ring by 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.640
 Medicines allowed in mexico 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.920
 but not the usa and this pure the 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.690
 usa to sell there and in there 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.820
 a kind of membership in the so-called 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.590
 dallas AIDS-sick at it clattering to 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.450
 give away for $ 400 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.340
 membership fee in the month this is a 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.720
 buzzing business but also 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.790
 government authorities are not so happy 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.140
 so you want to try his 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.880
 Last days still life really 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.310
 to enjoy and that will be him far 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.350
 more than just a short life span 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.510
 to stay that way is the end of it all 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.740
 movie that comes along very dramatically therefore 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.630
 a basic topic that actually 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.310
 It is incredibly important with a figure 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.170
 from homophobic to one 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.299
 friendship turns the beautiful view 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.160
 the movie has a lot of great dialogues 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.180
 authentic -looking moods based 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.620
 for the most part on a true 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.720
 history does not even have six 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.510
 million dollars in budget and is in 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.190
 been shot down 24 whole- day 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.540
 You have to say that's the absolute 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.700
 Madness one wonders why 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.140
 such a script for almost 20 years 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.150
 has not been realized 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.870
 and I can only say that's it 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.310
 what me 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.080
 hey said at his own 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.870
 Thanksgiving to the golden globe of everything 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.370
 it does not work to a film in which it 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.560
 dying is no that's a movie 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.000
 It's about life and who is 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.740
 approach the trailer for the 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.390
 should be interested in the topic 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.370
 watch the film in any case 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.870
 not necessarily a must for now 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.580
 the big screen because of course 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.580
 no movie is with showeffects it is 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.050
 a movie with quiet quiet offensive 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.760
 sound and above all a film about the 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.010
 I can think and discuss it 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.200
 I'm really really strong 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.840
 and you get the folds of 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.760
 to me as an authentic drama nine of 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.320
 ten possible points as well as 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.300
 altogether a film of which I have a lot 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.280
 I expected and expected this 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.170
 can redeem chappuis jared leto 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.930
 amazing what he plays there and 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.280
 the largest or female 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.320
 jennifer garner die 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.940
 here is a doctor who also plays 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.770
 slowly begins to its actual 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.630
 physique as first medical doctor and that 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.280
 Believe in the pharma industry begins 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.720
 to doubt in the film and there as well 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.670
 I have to do my own development 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.350
 say that this film is important here 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.760
 tackles topics and not too many 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.200
 details loses that because you look 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.850
 like to be with you if you like it very much 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.040
 I'm interested in that 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.990
 through with my role to dallas it was 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.550
 that works like a thumb with this 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.540
 might let it remain are not 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.070
 otherwise there are a few more 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.350
 movie reviews twitter and facebook or 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.360
