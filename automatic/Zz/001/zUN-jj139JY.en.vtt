here<00:01:58.290> whereas<00:01:59.219> on<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.969> variegated<00:02:00.750> part

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
here whereas on the variegated part

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.459 
here whereas on the variegated part
there's<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.979> lot<00:02:02.219> less<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.880> for<00:02:03.090> some<00:02:03.299> reason

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
there's a lot less of it for some reason

so I would tell you that this is a

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.139 
so I would tell you that this is a
drought<00:02:07.680> tolerant<00:02:08.369> plant<00:02:08.670> once<00:02:08.940> it's

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
drought tolerant plant once it's

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.400 
drought tolerant plant once it's
established<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:10.110> can<00:02:10.140> take

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
established it can take

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.620 
established it can take
low<00:02:11.500> amounts<00:02:11.980> of<00:02:12.130> water<00:02:12.370> infrequently<00:02:13.300> once

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
low amounts of water infrequently once

this<00:02:22.810> is<00:02:23.020> a<00:02:23.670> north-facing<00:02:24.670> fence<00:02:25.540> so<00:02:25.870> this<00:02:26.020> one

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
this is a north-facing fence so this one

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.870 
this is a north-facing fence so this one
doesn't<00:02:26.500> get<00:02:26.770> a<00:02:26.800> ton<00:02:27.100> of<00:02:27.130> light<00:02:27.490> especially

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
doesn't get a ton of light especially

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.820 
doesn't get a ton of light especially
with<00:02:28.390> these<00:02:28.570> trees<00:02:28.930> around<00:02:29.320> it<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:29.680> it's

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
with these trees around it and it's

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.190 
with these trees around it and it's
they're<00:02:30.160> doing<00:02:30.490> fine<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:34.060> other<00:02:34.240> thing<00:02:34.570> is<00:02:34.870> is

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
they're doing fine the other thing is is

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.370 
they're doing fine the other thing is is
a<00:02:35.230> lot<00:02:35.530> of<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.740> pittosporum<00:02:36.070> czar

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
a lot of the pittosporum czar

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.110 
a lot of the pittosporum czar
deer-resistant<00:02:38.440> I<00:02:38.530> would<00:02:38.740> say<00:02:39.010> so<00:02:39.070> I've<00:02:39.730> seen

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
deer-resistant I would say so I've seen

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.660 
deer-resistant I would say so I've seen
these<00:02:40.330> used<00:02:40.600> in<00:02:40.840> deer<00:02:41.110> areas<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:41.770> work<00:02:42.040> so

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
these used in deer areas and work so

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.410 
these used in deer areas and work so
they<00:02:43.060> might<00:02:43.270> be<00:02:43.450> worth<00:02:43.630> a<00:02:43.810> try<00:02:43.990> for<00:02:44.380> that<00:02:45.270> so<00:02:46.270> as

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
they might be worth a try for that so as

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.210 
they might be worth a try for that so as
a<00:02:46.450> design<00:02:46.960> element<00:02:47.500> i<00:02:47.650> would<00:02:47.800> just<00:02:47.980> say

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
a design element i would just say

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.600 
a design element i would just say
they're<00:02:48.460> a<00:02:48.490> good<00:02:49.500> massing<00:02:50.500> type<00:02:50.890> of<00:02:51.160> foliage

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
they're a good massing type of foliage

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.360 
they're a good massing type of foliage
plant<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.330> again<00:02:52.990> I<00:02:53.230> like<00:02:53.470> that<00:02:53.680> this<00:02:53.860> hasn't

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
plant and again I like that this hasn't

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.220 
plant and again I like that this hasn't
been<00:02:54.430> sheared<00:02:54.940> now<00:02:55.240> a<00:02:55.270> lot<00:02:55.570> of<00:02:55.690> people<00:02:56.050> will

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
been sheared now a lot of people will

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.250 
been sheared now a lot of people will
cheer<00:02:56.560> these<00:02:56.770> and<00:02:57.190> shape<00:02:57.520> them<00:02:57.820> but<00:02:58.480> I<00:02:58.750> like

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
cheer these and shape them but I like

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.680 
cheer these and shape them but I like
this<00:02:59.470> natural<00:03:00.070> form<00:03:00.460> is<00:03:00.700> dense<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:01.300> yet<00:03:01.510> it's

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
this natural form is dense and yet it's

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.860 
this natural form is dense and yet it's
it's<00:03:01.930> kind<00:03:02.290> of<00:03:02.410> irregular<00:03:03.180> has<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.210> nice<00:03:04.570> look

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
it's kind of irregular has a nice look

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.020 
it's kind of irregular has a nice look
to<00:03:04.900> it<00:03:05.200> for<00:03:05.470> me

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
to it for me
