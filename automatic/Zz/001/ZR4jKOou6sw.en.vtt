00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:06.240
 Have a nice day my ladies and 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.570
 What you see there is one 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.300
 Holzklotz flawless and what else 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.289
 see is around the wooden block right and 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.449
 left, I have something very 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:21.060
 elastic plastic nailed around and 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.490
 that has the advantage that if you wood 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.550
 hack that at least let's say 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.519
 50 70 percent will not get through the wood anymore 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.650
 the area flies up but in time 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.930
 the main square remains and it 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.489
 next to and next to an adjacent 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.800
 can grab a wheelbarrow 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:51.539
 I will now time to demonstrate short time 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:55.890
 see if it works that I mean it 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:01:08.270
 stay your second piece that's something 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:10.830
 very high here is the wood hanging 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.840
 can therefore not want to leave a can 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.049
 still jumping forward but too 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.000
 70 percent stays here and me 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.360
 I'm not looking forward to my bending over 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.360
 Wood 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:34.940
 As you can see I found that a lot 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.110
 good idea of ​​this man is not up 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.540
 grown my crap 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.760
 this invention if you say so 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.470
 but it was recently in the 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.380
 Watching TV and I have myself 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.660
 thought so well an expensive profigerät 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.340
 as such an inventor has imagined 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.800
 Of course, I will not buy myself 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.610
 but I have two plastic flights 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.590
 can take hold of just stop 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.750
 they are relatively elastic and still 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.210
 stable enough and we have it now 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.890
 a large amount of wood has been chopped and must 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.350
 honestly tell them it is one 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.869
 tremendous relief if mine 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.700
 wood no longer flies through the area 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.160
 and I have to search for it everywhere 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.080
 I have to bend over, I have to 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.000
 just a double work stays that way 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.670
 it on the chopping stock or at least 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.540
 70 percent lie and I can do it then 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.910
 take it easy 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.920
 split again or right in the 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.220
 Wheelbarrow throw it where it goes 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.600
 want 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:32.420
 so much for today 's topic tips for the 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.660
 everyday life of the buchheimer informs the 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.800
 thing with the wooden block must be so 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.800
 because again exactly 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.260
 So that means a normal log 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.019
 right and left with a bit more 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.230
 wood reinforces it does not look very 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:53.000
 professional but it works 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.570
 impeccable and it does not hinder 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.480
 while chopping 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:59.000
 Because you usually always the 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.000
 same direction has where you stand 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.220
 just and that 's just a great idea 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.800
 and i can only advise each other that way 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.310
 something to tinker even saves it 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.590
 einfiel press rum cake and his wood 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.900
 looking for something somewhere through the 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.250
 that's all for today 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.230
 my ladies and gentlemen I say goodbye 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:23.830
 me until the next educational film or 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.830
 interesting inventions
