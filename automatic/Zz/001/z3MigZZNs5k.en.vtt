old marks say pre 1993 one and what was
the<00:00:59.340> matter<00:00:59.489> with<00:00:59.579> that

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
the matter with that

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.970 
the matter with that
it<00:01:00.090> was<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.300> mobilizer<00:01:00.809> fault<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.500> nothing

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
it was a mobilizer fault so nothing

or<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:05.640> we've<00:01:05.939> established<00:01:06.119> beyond<00:01:07.049> doubt

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
or so we've established beyond doubt

or so we've established beyond doubt
that<00:01:08.189> old<00:01:08.369> mercs<00:01:08.610> are<00:01:08.850> tough<00:01:09.500> but<00:01:10.500> we<00:01:10.799> still

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
that old mercs are tough but we still

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.250 
that old mercs are tough but we still
haven't<00:01:11.490> found<00:01:11.729> them<00:01:12.000> limit<00:01:12.330> which<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.110> what

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
haven't found them limit which is what

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.330 
haven't found them limit which is what
we<00:01:13.500> intend<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.890> do<00:01:14.070> today<00:01:14.600> using<00:01:15.600> an<00:01:16.580> arsenal

seemingly<00:03:40.580> shrugged<00:03:41.180> off<00:03:41.330> our<00:03:41.540> attack<00:03:41.930> so<00:03:42.890> for

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
seemingly shrugged off our attack so for

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.890 
seemingly shrugged off our attack so for
the<00:03:43.310> final<00:03:43.730> test<00:03:43.910> we<00:03:44.209> decided<00:03:44.690> there<00:03:44.870> should

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
the final test we decided there should

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.280 
the final test we decided there should
be<00:03:45.140> no<00:03:45.590> holds<00:03:46.280> barred<00:03:46.660> we<00:03:47.660> want<00:03:47.900> to<00:03:48.080> see

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
be no holds barred we want to see

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.170 
be no holds barred we want to see
whether<00:03:48.590> there<00:03:48.860> was<00:03:48.950> any<00:03:49.280> grain<00:03:49.580> of<00:03:49.730> truth<00:03:49.880> in

was a car barely alive but Paul felt he
could<00:05:05.990> rebuild<00:05:06.170> it

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
could rebuild it

he had the technology he could make it

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.700 
he had the technology he could make it
better<00:05:09.380> than<00:05:09.680> it<00:05:09.710> was<00:05:09.950> before<00:05:10.660> better

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
better than it was before better

better than it was before better
stronger<00:05:12.710> faster<00:05:14.410> well<00:05:15.410> actually<00:05:15.710> all<00:05:16.100> he

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
stronger faster well actually all he

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.700 
stronger faster well actually all he
could<00:05:16.580> do<00:05:16.790> was<00:05:17.030> get<00:05:17.240> that<00:05:17.480> me<00:05:17.780> wiper<00:05:18.110> working

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
could do was get that me wiper working

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.320 
could do was get that me wiper working
making<00:05:19.130> it<00:05:19.370> look<00:05:19.490> like<00:05:19.550> something<00:05:20.120> from<00:05:20.240> the

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
making it look like something from the

making it look like something from the

end of terminator and then film fans
just<00:05:24.830> like<00:05:24.920> Lord<00:05:25.370> of<00:05:25.490> the<00:05:25.550> Rings<00:05:25.670> there<00:05:26.300> was

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.420 
just like Lord of the Rings there was

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.020 
just like Lord of the Rings there was
yet<00:05:26.630> another<00:05:26.810> ending<00:05:27.770> on<00:05:28.520> closer<00:05:28.880> inspection

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
yet another ending on closer inspection

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.510 
yet another ending on closer inspection
it<00:05:29.750> turns<00:05:30.020> out<00:05:30.200> the<00:05:30.320> engine<00:05:30.770> was<00:05:31.040> ok<00:05:33.400> but<00:05:34.400> it

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
it turns out the engine was ok but it

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.370 
it turns out the engine was ok but it
was<00:05:34.640> the<00:05:34.760> Waring<00:05:35.240> lean<00:05:35.420> of<00:05:35.600> the<00:05:35.690> immobilizer

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
was the Waring lean of the immobilizer

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.200 
was the Waring lean of the immobilizer
that<00:05:36.650> had<00:05:36.740> melted<00:05:37.250> and<00:05:37.430> was<00:05:37.550> preventing<00:05:38.090> us

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
that had melted and was preventing us

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.400 
that had melted and was preventing us
from<00:05:38.240> starting<00:05:38.780> it<00:05:39.970> so<00:05:40.970> our<00:05:41.510> Merc<00:05:41.960> engines

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
from starting it so our Merc engines

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.610 
from starting it so our Merc engines
bomb-proof<00:05:42.850> yes<00:05:43.850> but<00:05:44.750> their<00:05:44.900> immobilizes

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
bomb-proof yes but their immobilizes
