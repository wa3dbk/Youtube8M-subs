only benefits Templars verdict which to
me<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.660> thought<00:00:42.930> maybe<00:00:43.290> that's<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.950> bug<00:00:44.190> maybe<00:00:44.520> it

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
me I thought maybe that's a bug maybe it

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.069 
me I thought maybe that's a bug maybe it
actually<00:00:44.969> does<00:00:45.120> benefit<00:00:45.510> Templars<00:00:45.780> verdict

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079
