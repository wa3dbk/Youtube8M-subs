00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
in a hard drive and the first one is

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.320 
in a hard drive and the first one is
obviously<00:01:04.260> speed<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.309> performance<00:01:05.519> this

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
obviously speed and performance this

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
be there I remembered my Wi-Fi stuff all

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.719 
be there I remembered my Wi-Fi stuff all
this<00:01:40.170> stuff<00:01:40.380> up<00:01:40.530> here<00:01:40.740> all<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.159> fit<00:01:41.460> it

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
this stuff up here all of that fit it

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.840 
this stuff up here all of that fit it
was<00:01:41.850> just<00:01:41.970> incredible<00:01:42.180> how<00:01:42.540> well<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.990> worked

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
was just incredible how well it worked

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.850 
was just incredible how well it worked
so<00:01:44.850> performance<00:01:45.600> wise<00:01:45.780> that's<00:01:46.140> just<00:01:46.680> how<00:01:46.829> i

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
so performance wise that's just how i

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.560 
so performance wise that's just how i
installed<00:01:47.369> it's<00:01:47.579> not<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.759> clean<00:01:48.030> install<00:01:48.329> so

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
installed it's not a clean install so

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.300 
installed it's not a clean install so
that's<00:01:48.720> not<00:01:48.869> going<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.079> be<00:01:49.110> as<00:01:49.259> good<00:01:49.439> as<00:01:49.500> well<00:01:50.100> a

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
that's not going to be as good as well a

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.310 
that's not going to be as good as well a
clean<00:01:50.670> install<00:01:50.820> would<00:01:51.090> be<00:01:51.210> performance<00:01:52.200> is

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
clean install would be performance is

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.740 
clean install would be performance is
definitely<00:01:53.159> improved<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.729> noticed<00:01:54.119> big<00:01:54.360> things

performance<00:02:16.920> definitely<00:02:17.640> an<00:02:17.760> improvement

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
performance definitely an improvement

rpm<00:02:37.380> I<00:02:37.500> could<00:02:37.650> hear<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:37.950> thing<00:02:38.130> clicking<00:02:38.520> away

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
rpm I could hear the thing clicking away

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.890 
rpm I could hear the thing clicking away
I'd<00:02:38.910> pick<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.270> up<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:39.450> it<00:02:39.540> would<00:02:39.660> move<00:02:39.750> a

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
I'd pick it up and it would move a

little bit know maybe that was a

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.370 
little bit know maybe that was a

monitoring it from istat pro gives me

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.690 
monitoring it from istat pro gives me
the<00:03:25.140> temperatures<00:03:25.620> over<00:03:25.860> here<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.490> never

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
the temperatures over here and it never

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.370 
the temperatures over here and it never
goes<00:03:27.090> above<00:03:27.420> let's<00:03:27.750> see<00:03:27.900> where<00:03:28.050> it<00:03:28.110> is<00:03:28.230> right

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
goes above let's see where it is right

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.400 
goes above let's see where it is right
now<00:03:28.440> it's<00:03:29.430> a<00:03:29.550> hard<00:03:29.790> drive<00:03:30.000> macintosh<00:03:30.540> HD<00:03:30.690> is<00:03:31.020> 28

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
now it's a hard drive macintosh HD is 28

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.540 
now it's a hard drive macintosh HD is 28
degrees<00:03:31.790> so<00:03:33.260> everything<00:03:34.260> there<00:03:34.470> looks<00:03:34.980> good<00:03:35.250> i

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
degrees so everything there looks good i

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.000 
degrees so everything there looks good i
have<00:03:36.450> not<00:03:36.570> had<00:03:36.630> it<00:03:36.900> over<00:03:36.990> 39<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:37.770> that's<00:03:37.890> when

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
have not had it over 39 and that's when

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.800 
have not had it over 39 and that's when
it's<00:03:38.130> been<00:03:38.280> on<00:03:38.370> for<00:03:38.400> a<00:03:38.640> long<00:03:38.820> time<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.150> writing

it's been on for a long time and writing
and<00:03:39.930> reading<00:03:40.080> a<00:03:40.230> lot<00:03:40.350> of<00:03:40.500> stuff<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.710> it<00:03:40.980> so<00:03:41.100> very

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
and reading a lot of stuff to it so very

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.630

no noise not make actually they could

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.100 
no noise not make actually they could
probably<00:03:56.790> will<00:03:57.120> make<00:03:57.300> some<00:03:57.510> heat<00:03:57.720> but<00:03:57.870> not<00:03:57.990> as

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
probably will make some heat but not as

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.740 
probably will make some heat but not as
much<00:03:58.260> as<00:03:58.320> a<00:03:58.470> moving<00:03:58.830> part<00:03:59.070> disk<00:03:59.570> but<00:04:00.570> you<00:04:00.660> know

solid-state drives are just too

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.010 
solid-state drives are just too

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
familiar with this battery you know I

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.200 
familiar with this battery you know I
used<00:04:53.530> to<00:04:53.740> think<00:04:53.890> every<00:04:54.250> day<00:04:54.430> almost<00:04:54.700> a<00:04:55.000> full

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
used to think every day almost a full

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.750 
used to think every day almost a full
charge<00:04:55.420> every<00:04:55.810> day<00:04:55.990> and<00:04:56.230> I<00:04:56.950> know<00:04:57.160> what<00:04:57.490> it<00:04:57.610> says

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
charge every day and I know what it says

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.340 
charge every day and I know what it says
about<00:04:57.820> this<00:04:58.240> time<00:04:58.480> in<00:04:58.630> the<00:04:58.720> evening<00:04:59.050> and<00:04:59.200> it's

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
about this time in the evening and it's

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.560 
about this time in the evening and it's
pretty<00:04:59.650> much<00:04:59.830> spot<00:05:00.130> on<00:05:00.190> do<00:05:00.820> I<00:05:00.850> think<00:05:01.120> it<00:05:01.240> uses<00:05:01.540> a

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
pretty much spot on do I think it uses a

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.510 
pretty much spot on do I think it uses a
little<00:05:02.020> bit<00:05:02.140> more<00:05:02.260> power<00:05:02.500> yeah<00:05:02.980> I<00:05:03.010> would<00:05:03.340> say

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
little bit more power yeah I would say

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.420 
little bit more power yeah I would say
that<00:05:03.550> it<00:05:03.850> would<00:05:04.620> except<00:05:05.620> i<00:05:05.710> can't<00:05:05.740> notice<00:05:06.280> it

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
that it would except i can't notice it

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.880 
that it would except i can't notice it
so<00:05:06.700> do<00:05:07.120> not<00:05:07.270> at<00:05:07.540> all<00:05:07.690> let<00:05:08.080> that<00:05:08.110> be<00:05:08.380> a<00:05:08.410> factor<00:05:08.860> of

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
so do not at all let that be a factor of

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.950 
so do not at all let that be a factor of
you<00:05:09.880> not<00:05:10.030> getting<00:05:10.330> the<00:05:10.510> drive<00:05:10.720> it's

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
you not getting the drive it's

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.409 
you not getting the drive it's
definitely<00:05:11.470> I<00:05:11.680> guess<00:05:12.400> fuel<00:05:12.760> efficient<00:05:13.210> enough

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
definitely I guess fuel efficient enough

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:14.790 
definitely I guess fuel efficient enough
so<00:05:13.810> I<00:05:13.840> hope<00:05:14.020> that<00:05:14.140> was<00:05:14.200> a<00:05:14.320> good<00:05:14.470> follow<00:05:14.710> up

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
so I hope that was a good follow up

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.260 
so I hope that was a good follow up
