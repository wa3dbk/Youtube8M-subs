00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.120 
a variety like in modern warfare 2 we
had<00:02:22.330> favela<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:23.020> then<00:02:23.230> we<00:02:23.350> had<00:02:23.500> underpass

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
had favela and then we had underpass

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.980 
had favela and then we had underpass
which<00:02:24.460> of<00:02:24.580> you<00:02:24.640> guys<00:02:24.760> don't<00:02:25.000> remember<00:02:25.120> favela

which of you guys don't remember favela

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.080 
which of you guys don't remember favela
was<00:02:26.350> like<00:02:26.560> bright<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.160> sunny<00:02:27.520> and<00:02:27.610> beautiful

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
was like bright and sunny and beautiful

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.660 
was like bright and sunny and beautiful
and<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:29.260> underpass<00:02:29.710> was<00:02:30.040> dark<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:30.550> gloomy

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
and the underpass was dark and gloomy

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.370 
and the underpass was dark and gloomy
and<00:02:31.000> rainy<00:02:31.300> so<00:02:31.570> there<00:02:31.690> are<00:02:31.720> pretty<00:02:31.960> much<00:02:32.080> polar

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
and rainy so there are pretty much polar

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.890 
and rainy so there are pretty much polar
opposites<00:02:32.920> and<00:02:33.100> having<00:02:34.030> that<00:02:34.060> mix<00:02:34.450> is<00:02:34.660> not<00:02:34.870> a

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
opposites and having that mix is not a

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.390 
opposites and having that mix is not a
bad<00:02:35.110> thing<00:02:35.320> you<00:02:35.440> know<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:35.830> keeps<00:02:36.190> it

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
bad thing you know it keeps it

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.860 
bad thing you know it keeps it
interesting<00:02:36.670> it<00:02:37.000> keeps<00:02:37.210> it<00:02:37.390> different<00:02:37.780> and

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
interesting it keeps it different and

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.650 
interesting it keeps it different and
makes<00:02:38.170> it<00:02:38.350> less<00:02:38.590> boring<00:02:39.060> but<00:02:40.060> at<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.420> same

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
makes it less boring but at the same

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.750 
makes it less boring but at the same
time<00:02:40.930> I<00:02:41.140> do<00:02:41.260> like<00:02:41.710> good-looking<00:02:41.950> maps<00:02:42.460> and<00:02:42.670> I

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
time I do like good-looking maps and I

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.280 
time I do like good-looking maps and I
think<00:02:43.060> for<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.300> most<00:02:43.480> part<00:02:43.600> they<00:02:43.900> will<00:02:44.140> have

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
think for the most part they will have

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.080 
think for the most part they will have
good-looking<00:02:44.500> maps<00:02:44.950> because<00:02:45.160> if<00:02:45.520> you<00:02:45.850> take<00:02:45.880> a

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
good-looking maps because if you take a

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.640 
good-looking maps because if you take a
look<00:02:46.150> at<00:02:46.390> what<00:02:46.510> they<00:02:46.630> did<00:02:46.840> with<00:02:46.990> the<00:02:47.140> old<00:02:47.170> call

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
look at what they did with the old call

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.990 
look at what they did with the old call
of<00:02:47.740> duty<00:02:47.920> 4<00:02:47.950> maps<00:02:48.370> when<00:02:48.610> they<00:02:48.700> brought<00:02:48.880> him

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
of duty 4 maps when they brought him

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.970 
of duty 4 maps when they brought him
back<00:02:49.150> into<00:02:49.420> that<00:02:49.570> overgrown<00:02:50.230> they<00:02:50.380> had<00:02:50.530> strike

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
back into that overgrown they had strike

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.150 
back into that overgrown they had strike
they<00:02:51.250> had<00:02:51.570> crashed<00:02:52.570> all<00:02:52.930> of<00:02:53.410> those<00:02:53.590> new<00:02:53.860> maps

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
they had crashed all of those new maps

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.830 
they had crashed all of those new maps

deterrents<00:03:09.400> so<00:03:09.760> what<00:03:10.600> could<00:03:10.720> we<00:03:10.780> have<00:03:11.050> here<00:03:11.290> we

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
deterrents so what could we have here we

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.530 
deterrents so what could we have here we
could<00:03:11.680> have<00:03:11.890> a<00:03:11.920> perk<00:03:12.250> just<00:03:12.730> like<00:03:12.880> flak<00:03:13.150> jacket

we could have an equipment so like in

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.460 
we could have an equipment so like in
Monell<00:03:16.060> 42<00:03:16.330> we<00:03:16.480> had<00:03:16.600> the<00:03:16.720> blast<00:03:16.990> shield<00:03:17.320> that

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
Monell 42 we had the blast shield that

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.870 
Monell 42 we had the blast shield that
you<00:03:17.560> could<00:03:17.710> turn<00:03:17.860> off<00:03:18.100> and<00:03:18.250> on<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.550> protect

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
you could turn off and on to protect

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.880 
you could turn off and on to protect
yourself<00:03:19.030> and<00:03:19.450> then<00:03:19.930> we<00:03:20.020> could<00:03:20.170> also<00:03:20.380> have<00:03:20.740> a

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
yourself and then we could also have a

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.410

weapon<00:03:21.400> you<00:03:21.550> know<00:03:21.670> we<00:03:21.850> could<00:03:21.970> have<00:03:22.000> the<00:03:22.180> riot

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
weapon you know we could have the riot

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.940

shield<00:03:22.540> that's<00:03:22.960> making<00:03:23.230> a<00:03:23.290> comeback<00:03:23.500> we<00:03:23.770> saw

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
shield that's making a comeback we saw

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.710 
shield that's making a comeback we saw
met<00:03:24.100> in<00:03:24.190> spec<00:03:24.460> ops<00:03:24.610> trailer<00:03:24.880> could<00:03:25.480> we<00:03:25.600> have

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
met in spec ops trailer could we have

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.600 
met in spec ops trailer could we have
something<00:03:26.020> else<00:03:26.200> you<00:03:26.590> never<00:03:26.890> know<00:03:27.220> you<00:03:27.400> know

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
something else you never know you know

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.280 
something else you never know you know
so<00:03:28.090> we're<00:03:28.360> gonna<00:03:28.480> have<00:03:28.630> multiple<00:03:29.170> different

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
so we're gonna have multiple different

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.490 
so we're gonna have multiple different
types<00:03:29.710> and<00:03:29.860> ways<00:03:30.540> that<00:03:31.540> we<00:03:31.750> can<00:03:32.050> protect

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
types and ways that we can protect

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.170 
types and ways that we can protect
ourselves<00:03:32.650> from<00:03:33.130> noob<00:03:33.580> tubes<00:03:33.850> and<00:03:34.030> from

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
ourselves from noob tubes and from

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.250 
ourselves from noob tubes and from
grenades<00:03:34.510> and<00:03:34.660> stuff<00:03:34.900> which<00:03:35.020> I'm<00:03:35.170> excited

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
grenades and stuff which I'm excited

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260 
grenades and stuff which I'm excited
about<00:03:35.590> and<00:03:36.070> then<00:03:36.250> he<00:03:36.340> also<00:03:36.520> goes<00:03:36.790> on<00:03:36.940> to<00:03:37.000> say

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
about and then he also goes on to say

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.270 
about and then he also goes on to say
that<00:03:37.450> they've<00:03:37.900> lowered<00:03:38.230> explosive<00:03:39.100> damage

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
that they've lowered explosive damage

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.580 
that they've lowered explosive damage
overall<00:03:40.120> so<00:03:40.480> it's<00:03:40.660> more<00:03:40.870> gun<00:03:41.080> on<00:03:41.200> gun<00:03:41.380> action

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
overall so it's more gun on gun action

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.770 
overall so it's more gun on gun action
so<00:03:41.980> well<00:03:42.460> they've<00:03:42.790> learned<00:03:43.150> from<00:03:43.390> their<00:03:43.570> one

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.930 
cod4 style weapons so it is possible
that<00:04:29.320> we<00:04:29.770> could<00:04:29.950> see<00:04:30.130> the<00:04:30.250> sniper<00:04:30.490> come<00:04:30.790> back

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
that we could see the sniper come back

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.730 
that we could see the sniper come back
it's<00:04:31.210> possible<00:04:31.750> that<00:04:31.900> we<00:04:32.020> could<00:04:32.169> see<00:04:32.380> like<00:04:32.620> the

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
it's possible that we could see like the

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.250 
it's possible that we could see like the

team<00:04:33.380> come<00:04:33.650> back<00:04:33.860> I<00:04:34.100> saw<00:04:34.490> a<00:04:34.520> gun<00:04:34.670> kind<00:04:34.880> of

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
team come back I saw a gun kind of

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.670 
team come back I saw a gun kind of
similar<00:04:35.210> to<00:04:35.330> that<00:04:35.570> and<00:04:35.840> the<00:04:35.960> spec<00:04:36.170> ops<00:04:36.380> trailer

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
similar to that and the spec ops trailer

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.730 
similar to that and the spec ops trailer
and<00:04:37.610> we<00:04:38.510> could<00:04:38.630> possibly<00:04:38.840> see<00:04:39.200> like<00:04:39.350> the<00:04:39.440> AK

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
and we could possibly see like the AK

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.020 
and we could possibly see like the AK
and<00:04:39.890> stuff<00:04:40.040> so<00:04:40.190> maybe<00:04:40.490> they're<00:04:40.700> bringing<00:04:41.000> back

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
and stuff so maybe they're bringing back

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.180 
and stuff so maybe they're bringing back
the<00:04:41.330> fan<00:04:41.570> favorites<00:04:42.080> from<00:04:42.200> Colby<00:04:42.590> before<00:04:42.890> that

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
would be pretty cool but we'll have to

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.750 
would be pretty cool but we'll have to
wait<00:04:44.900> and<00:04:45.050> see<00:04:45.200> only<00:04:45.680> confirm<00:04:46.010> things<00:04:46.190> are<00:04:46.370> mp5

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760

kind<00:05:43.460> of<00:05:43.490> go<00:05:43.700> until<00:05:44.000> you<00:05:44.120> die<00:05:44.300> and

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
kind of go until you die and

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.060 
kind of go until you die and
increasingly<00:05:45.020> gets<00:05:45.260> harder<00:05:45.560> so<00:05:45.680> it's<00:05:45.830> just

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
increasingly gets harder so it's just

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.210
