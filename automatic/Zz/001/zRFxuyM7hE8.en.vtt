closed the gate and i'm pretty sure all
of<00:02:24.270> us<00:02:24.510> had<00:02:24.989> some<00:02:25.440> trust<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.190> faith<00:02:26.400> in<00:02:26.459> him

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
of us had some trust and faith in him

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.150 
of us had some trust and faith in him
considering<00:02:27.270> he<00:02:27.390> was<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.569> pilot<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.200> he

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
considering he was a pilot and he

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.650 
considering he was a pilot and he
probably<00:02:29.459> knows<00:02:29.819> what<00:02:30.030> he's<00:02:30.120> doing<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:30.629> i

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
probably knows what he's doing so i

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.880 
probably knows what he's doing so i
figured<00:02:31.019> out<00:02:31.140> on<00:02:31.319> the<00:02:31.379> side<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.680> seat

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
figured out on the side of the seat

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.290 
figured out on the side of the seat
considering<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.459> was<00:02:32.489> a<00:02:32.580> long<00:02:32.819> flight<00:02:32.849> they

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
considering it was a long flight they

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.270 
considering it was a long flight they
had<00:02:33.510> this<00:02:33.840> radio<00:02:34.470> kind<00:02:34.830> of<00:02:34.920> thing<00:02:35.069> set<00:02:35.250> up

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
had this radio kind of thing set up

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.530 
had this radio kind of thing set up
where<00:02:35.459> you<00:02:35.550> go<00:02:35.700> through<00:02:35.910> channels<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.420> turn

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
where you go through channels and turn

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.059 
where you go through channels and turn
on<00:02:36.629> the<00:02:36.690> volume<00:02:37.019> and<00:02:37.140> stuff<00:02:37.349> so<00:02:37.739> i'm<00:02:37.890> going

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
on the volume and stuff so i'm going

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.259 
on the volume and stuff so i'm going
through<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.310> channels<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:38.819> i'm<00:02:38.910> listening

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
through the channels and i'm listening

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.280 
through the channels and i'm listening
to<00:02:39.300> everything<00:02:39.569> they<00:02:39.750> have<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:40.080> all<00:02:40.170> of<00:02:40.260> a

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
to everything they have and all of a

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.530 
to everything they have and all of a
sudden<00:02:40.319> I<00:02:40.620> hear<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.160> tower<00:02:41.730> talking<00:02:42.390> back<00:02:42.510> to

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
sudden I hear a tower talking back to

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.270 
sudden I hear a tower talking back to
the<00:02:42.629> pilot<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.080> I<00:02:43.260> didn't<00:02:43.560> know<00:02:43.680> that<00:02:44.099> it<00:02:44.129> was

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
the pilot and I didn't know that it was

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.430 
the pilot and I didn't know that it was
actually<00:02:44.640> our<00:02:44.760> flight<00:02:45.120> until<00:02:45.330> he<00:02:45.629> goes<00:02:45.780> dealt

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
actually our flight until he goes dealt

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.080 
actually our flight until he goes dealt

off from this one way at all evacuate
now<00:02:49.950> stop<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.430> flight<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:50.870> there<00:02:51.870> is<00:02:52.019> nothing

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
now stop the flight and there is nothing

from the other side you cannot hear the
pilots<00:02:54.090> say<00:02:54.180> anything<00:02:54.629> we've<00:02:54.780> basically

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
pilots say anything we've basically

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.470 
pilots say anything we've basically
ignoring<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:55.920> tower<00:02:56.129> so<00:02:56.670> we<00:02:56.819> take<00:02:57.000> off<00:02:57.269> and

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
ignoring the tower so we take off and

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.960 
ignoring the tower so we take off and
from<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.260> beginning<00:02:58.409> we<00:02:59.190> are<00:02:59.340> hitting<00:02:59.580> mad

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
from the beginning we are hitting mad

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.059 
from the beginning we are hitting mad
turbulence<00:03:00.629> the<00:03:00.930> turbulence<00:03:01.319> was<00:03:01.440> so<00:03:01.680> bad<00:03:01.920> as

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
turbulence the turbulence was so bad as

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.860 
turbulence the turbulence was so bad as
soon<00:03:02.280> as<00:03:02.430> we<00:03:02.550> got<00:03:02.640> up<00:03:02.700> into<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.120> air<00:03:03.150> maybe<00:03:03.750> a

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
hitting turbulence we weren't even like

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
seeing it everywhere you could look out

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:53.630 
seeing it everywhere you could look out
of<00:03:52.469> the<00:03:52.530> window<00:03:52.739> and<00:03:52.890> see<00:03:52.980> it<00:03:53.129> right<00:03:53.310> next<00:03:53.549> to

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
of the window and see it right next to

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.860 
of the window and see it right next to
us<00:03:53.670> and<00:03:53.909> then<00:03:54.000> we<00:03:54.269> start<00:03:54.480> dropping<00:03:54.780> in

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
us and then we start dropping in

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.599 
us and then we start dropping in
altitude<00:03:54.989> so<00:03:55.590> much<00:03:55.739> of<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:55.950> oxygen<00:03:56.250> masks

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
altitude so much of the oxygen masks

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:57.890 
altitude so much of the oxygen masks
come<00:03:56.700> out<00:03:56.790> of<00:03:56.879> the<00:03:56.969> top<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:57.359> as<00:03:57.420> soon<00:03:57.540> as<00:03:57.659> I<00:03:57.719> saw

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
come out of the top and as soon as I saw

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.569 
come out of the top and as soon as I saw
that<00:03:57.930> I<00:03:58.290> knew<00:03:58.319> that<00:03:58.739> we<00:03:59.099> were<00:03:59.189> about<00:03:59.310> to<00:03:59.370> get

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
that I knew that we were about to get

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.849 
that I knew that we were about to get
screwed<00:04:00.030> up<00:04:00.239> we<00:04:00.840> continued<00:04:01.290> dropping<00:04:01.709> but

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
screwed up we continued dropping but

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.020 
screwed up we continued dropping but
fast<00:04:02.099> enough<00:04:02.400> that<00:04:02.549> we<00:04:02.609> make<00:04:02.760> it<00:04:02.849> to<00:04:02.939> the

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
fast enough that we make it to the

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.429 
fast enough that we make it to the
Maryland<00:04:03.239> Airport<00:04:03.780> shorter<00:04:04.140> than<00:04:04.290> we<00:04:04.349> were

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:04.439 
Maryland Airport shorter than we were

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:06.289 
Maryland Airport shorter than we were
supposed<00:04:04.739> to<00:04:04.859> make<00:04:05.069> it<00:04:05.220> we<00:04:05.640> are<00:04:05.790> going<00:04:06.060> down<00:04:06.269> to

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
supposed to make it we are going down to

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.780 
supposed to make it we are going down to
the<00:04:06.540> runway<00:04:06.659> so<00:04:07.379> fast<00:04:07.859> we<00:04:08.220> basically<00:04:08.459> hit<00:04:08.760> the

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
the runway so fast we basically hit the

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.670 
the runway so fast we basically hit the
runway<00:04:09.120> sideways<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:09.930> we're<00:04:10.079> sliding<00:04:10.439> and

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
runway sideways and we're sliding and

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.440 
runway sideways and we're sliding and
skidding<00:04:11.069> across<00:04:11.129> it<00:04:11.549> going<00:04:12.030> in<00:04:12.150> a<00:04:12.209> circular

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
skidding across it going in a circular

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.649 
skidding across it going in a circular
motion<00:04:12.799> it<00:04:13.799> was<00:04:13.920> just<00:04:14.129> so<00:04:14.909> tear<00:04:15.150> files<00:04:15.389> looking

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
motion it was just so tear files looking

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.719 
motion it was just so tear files looking
at<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:15.900> window<00:04:16.139> the<00:04:16.229> entire<00:04:16.259> time<00:04:16.889> and<00:04:17.220> I<00:04:17.549> had
