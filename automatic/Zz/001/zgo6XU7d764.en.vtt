epidemic this is Oakley hi def and I'm
here<00:00:03.990> to<00:00:04.049> bring<00:00:04.140> your<00:00:04.290> tutorial<00:00:04.740> this<00:00:05.220> is

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
here to bring your tutorial this is

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.980 
here to bring your tutorial this is
going<00:00:05.460> to<00:00:05.520> be<00:00:05.700> showing<00:00:06.270> you<00:00:06.420> how<00:00:06.690> to<00:00:06.720> make<00:00:06.930> a

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
going to be showing you how to make a

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.320 
going to be showing you how to make a
train<00:00:07.319> how<00:00:08.010> to<00:00:08.069> make<00:00:08.309> our<00:00:08.460> automated<00:00:08.910> vehicles

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
train how to make our automated vehicles

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.970 
train how to make our automated vehicles
essentially<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.050> lot<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.380> stuff<00:00:10.620> that<00:00:10.860> we

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
essentially a lot of stuff that we

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.320 
essentially a lot of stuff that we
decide<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.370> put<00:00:11.490> together<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:11.969> it's<00:00:12.240> all

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
decide to put together and it's all

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.030 
decide to put together and it's all
based<00:00:12.570> off<00:00:12.750> gravity<00:00:12.990> volumes<00:00:13.530> so<00:00:13.710> you<00:00:13.799> can<00:00:13.920> see

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
based off gravity volumes so you can see

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.980 
based off gravity volumes so you can see
this<00:00:14.190> setup<00:00:14.400> here<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.790> based<00:00:15.269> off<00:00:15.480> what<00:00:15.690> we<00:00:15.809> saw

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
this setup here is based off what we saw

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.750 
this setup here is based off what we saw
on<00:00:16.139> certain<00:00:16.529> affinities<00:00:16.980> video<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.460> I'll

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
on certain affinities video and I'll

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.160 
on certain affinities video and I'll
link<00:00:17.940> that<00:00:18.029> right<00:00:18.359> here<00:00:18.630> so<00:00:18.779> you<00:00:18.869> guys<00:00:18.990> can<00:00:19.109> go

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
link that right here so you guys can go

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.510 
link that right here so you guys can go
ahead<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.439> check<00:00:19.560> them<00:00:19.680> out<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.189> game

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
ahead and check them out the game

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.920 
ahead and check them out the game
developers<00:00:21.000> behind<00:00:21.119> forge<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.689> they<00:00:21.750> come

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
developers behind forge and they come

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.240 
developers behind forge and they come
out<00:00:22.020> with<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> whole<00:00:22.350> bunch<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.650> tutorials<00:00:23.160> as

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
out with a whole bunch of tutorials as

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.120 
out with a whole bunch of tutorials as
well<00:00:23.449> so<00:00:24.449> as<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.810> creators<00:00:25.109> they<00:00:25.439> know<00:00:25.680> what

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
well so as the creators they know what

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.769 
well so as the creators they know what
they're<00:00:26.310> talking<00:00:26.340> about<00:00:26.730> but<00:00:27.269> otherwise<00:00:27.539> you

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
they're talking about but otherwise you

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.120 
they're talking about but otherwise you
know<00:00:27.810> we<00:00:27.990> go<00:00:28.109> ahead<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.349> find<00:00:28.529> these<00:00:28.680> glitches

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
know we go ahead and find these glitches

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.490 
know we go ahead and find these glitches
and<00:00:29.310> we<00:00:30.000> apply<00:00:30.449> them<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:30.779> different<00:00:31.019> ways<00:00:31.170> so

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
and we apply them in different ways so

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.080 
and we apply them in different ways so
you<00:00:31.560> can<00:00:31.650> see<00:00:31.830> right<00:00:31.949> here<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.279> along<00:00:32.880> this

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
you can see right here is along this

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.030 
you can see right here is along this
track<00:00:33.329> I'm<00:00:33.540> putting<00:00:33.930> down<00:00:33.960> these<00:00:34.620> gravity

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
track I'm putting down these gravity

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.950 
track I'm putting down these gravity
volumes<00:00:35.430> invisible<00:00:36.059> ones<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.450> sliding<00:00:36.870> them

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
volumes invisible ones and sliding them

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.780 
volumes invisible ones and sliding them
across<00:00:37.309> now<00:00:38.309> what<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.489> can<00:00:38.610> do<00:00:38.700> that's

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
across now what you can do that's

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.100 
across now what you can do that's
interesting<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.360> right<00:00:39.390> at<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:39.750> juncture

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
interesting is right at this juncture

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.880 
interesting is right at this juncture
here<00:00:40.290> raise<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.250> such<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.090> still<00:00:42.390> affects

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
here raise it such that it still affects

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.260 
here raise it such that it still affects
bigger<00:00:43.890> objects<00:00:44.280> passing<00:00:44.460> through<00:00:44.850> but<00:00:45.180> if

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
bigger objects passing through but if

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.310 
bigger objects passing through but if
there's<00:00:45.450> among<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.989> ground<00:00:46.170> it

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
there's among this on the ground it

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.040 
there's among this on the ground it
won't<00:00:46.410> be<00:00:46.559> affected<00:00:47.010> or<00:00:47.129> players<00:00:47.579> as<00:00:47.820> well<00:00:48.050> the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
won't be affected or players as well the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.630 
won't be affected or players as well the
inverse<00:00:49.379> can<00:00:49.590> also<00:00:49.710> work<00:00:50.010> if<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.250> want<00:00:50.430> people

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
inverse can also work if you want people

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.740 
inverse can also work if you want people
running<00:00:50.879> on<00:00:50.969> top<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.360> crates<00:00:51.600> while

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
running on top of the crates while

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.180 
running on top of the crates while
they're<00:00:51.899> moving<00:00:51.989> go<00:00:52.649> ahead<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:52.920> put<00:00:53.039> that

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
they're moving go ahead and put that

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.160 
they're moving go ahead and put that
gravity<00:00:53.520> volume<00:00:53.820> lower<00:00:54.420> than<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.840> crates

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
gravity volume lower than the crates

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.630 
gravity volume lower than the crates
total<00:00:55.620> height<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.100> way<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.309> create<00:00:56.550> is

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
total height that way the create is

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.979 
total height that way the create is
still<00:00:56.789> affected<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.210> players<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.629> top<00:00:57.809> are

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
still affected the players on top are

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.229 
still affected the players on top are
not<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.739> there's<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.520> lot<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.760> can<00:00:59.879> do<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.090> play

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
not so there's a lot you can do to play

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.160 
not so there's a lot you can do to play
around<00:01:00.390> with<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.870> I'm<00:01:00.930> going<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.109> go

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
around with this and I'm going to go

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.650 
around with this and I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.530> show<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.039> how<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.370> works<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:02.820> along

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
ahead and show you how it works so along

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.390 
ahead and show you how it works so along
this<00:01:03.870> track<00:01:04.229> or<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.830> can<00:01:04.860> just<00:01:05.040> put<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.280> on

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
this track or you can just put this on

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.070 
this track or you can just put this on
the<00:01:05.460> ground<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.850> can<00:01:05.880> place<00:01:06.180> various<00:01:06.600> objects

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
the ground you can place various objects

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.870 
the ground you can place various objects
now<00:01:07.260> they<00:01:07.350> have<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.560> be<00:01:07.680> movable<00:01:07.979> objects<00:01:08.520> for

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
now they have to be movable objects for

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.609 
now they have to be movable objects for
them<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.090> actually<00:01:09.210> work<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.479> customs<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.530> I'll

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
them to actually work in customs so I'll

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.990 
them to actually work in customs so I'll
place<00:01:10.830> down<00:01:11.040> these<00:01:11.159> objects<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.700> as<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.880> can

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
place down these objects and as you can

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.030 
place down these objects and as you can
see<00:01:12.210> they're<00:01:12.600> moved<00:01:12.900> along<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:13.860> can<00:01:14.010> be

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
see they're moved along so this can be

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.280 
see they're moved along so this can be
some<00:01:14.310> sort<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.549> conveyor<00:01:14.880> belt<00:01:15.240> or<00:01:15.720> for

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
some sort of conveyor belt or for

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.539 
some sort of conveyor belt or for
machinima<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.830> could<00:01:16.950> be<00:01:17.040> effect<00:01:17.369> where

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
machinima it could be effect where

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.010 
machinima it could be effect where
you're<00:01:17.670> trying<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.939> replicate<00:01:18.090> wind<00:01:18.659> or<00:01:18.900> an

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
you're trying to replicate wind or an

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.240 
you're trying to replicate wind or an
explosion<00:01:19.380> where<00:01:19.710> everything<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.100> just

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
explosion where everything is just

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.130 
explosion where everything is just
thrown<00:01:20.549> about<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.090> those<00:01:21.240> are<00:01:21.360> some<00:01:21.509> cool<00:01:21.720> uses

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
thrown about so those are some cool uses

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.050 
thrown about so those are some cool uses
of<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.590> now<00:01:23.070> if<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.250> want<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.700> work<00:01:23.820> in

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
of it now if you want it to work in

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.149 
of it now if you want it to work in
minigames<00:01:24.570> or<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:25.350> custom<00:01:25.710> games<00:01:25.740> what<00:01:26.070> you're

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
minigames or in custom games what you're

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.800 
minigames or in custom games what you're
gonna<00:01:26.250> have<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.490> do<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.909> make<00:01:27.509> sure<00:01:27.540> these

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
gonna have to do is make sure these

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.780 
gonna have to do is make sure these
objects<00:01:28.200> are<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.530> normal<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.130> then<00:01:29.700> you're

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
objects are on normal and then you're

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.910 
objects are on normal and then you're
gonna<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.090> do<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> slight<00:01:30.540> trick<00:01:30.900> if<00:01:31.740> you

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
gonna have to do a slight trick if you

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.929 
gonna have to do a slight trick if you
were<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.100> place<00:01:32.280> them<00:01:32.430> down<00:01:32.549> like<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.790> and

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
were to place them down like this and

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.270 
were to place them down like this and
then<00:01:33.030> save<00:01:33.299> your<00:01:33.479> map<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:34.530> game<00:01:35.009> will

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
then save your map the game will

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.730 
then save your map the game will
remember<00:01:35.549> where<00:01:35.850> they<00:01:36.000> are<00:01:36.030> right<00:01:36.600> now<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:37.439> not

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
remember where they are right now so not

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.990 
remember where they are right now so not
at<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.920> beginning<00:01:38.070> where<00:01:38.520> they<00:01:38.610> ended<00:01:38.880> up

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
at the beginning where they ended up

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.880 
at the beginning where they ended up
when<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.240> save<00:01:39.450> them<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.810> then<00:01:40.110> what<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.829> will

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
when you save them and then what it will

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.020 
when you save them and then what it will
do<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.189> will<00:01:41.250> spawn<00:01:41.549> them<00:01:41.700> there<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:41.939> they

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
do it will spawn them there and they

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.219 
do it will spawn them there and they
won't<00:01:42.180> move<00:01:42.329> anymore<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.780> what<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:42.990> have<00:01:43.110> to

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
won't move anymore so what you have to

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.889 
won't move anymore so what you have to
do<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.619> put<00:01:44.130> them<00:01:44.280> on<00:01:44.399> fixed<00:01:44.909> raise<00:01:45.600> them<00:01:45.810> a

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
do is put them on fixed raise them a

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.380 
do is put them on fixed raise them a
little<00:01:46.140> bit<00:01:46.350> above<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.710> ground<00:01:46.920> then<00:01:47.880> without

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
little bit above the ground then without

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.999 
little bit above the ground then without
touching<00:01:48.630> them<00:01:48.840> put<00:01:49.170> them<00:01:49.290> back<00:01:49.380> on<00:01:49.560> normal

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
touching them put them back on normal

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.800 
touching them put them back on normal
and<00:01:50.220> then<00:01:50.340> save<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.700> game<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:51.420> what<00:01:51.540> happens

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
and then save the game so what happens

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.270 
and then save the game so what happens
when<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.020> go<00:01:52.079> into<00:01:52.200> custom<00:01:52.530> games<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.979> the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
when you go into custom games is the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.649 
when you go into custom games is the
game<00:01:53.399> remembers<00:01:53.880> your<00:01:54.000> objects<00:01:54.360> supposed<00:01:54.600> to

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
game remembers your objects supposed to

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.330 
game remembers your objects supposed to
be<00:01:54.750> there<00:01:54.960> it's<00:01:55.170> floating<00:01:55.649> like<00:01:55.920> an<00:01:56.040> inch<00:01:56.159> off

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
be there it's floating like an inch off

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.730 
be there it's floating like an inch off
the<00:01:56.369> ground<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.909> then<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.170> second<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.590> game

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
the ground and then the second the game

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.530 
the ground and then the second the game
realizes<00:01:59.219> oh<00:01:59.399> okay<00:01:59.729> this<00:01:59.850> object<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.390> now

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
realizes oh okay this object is now

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.719 
realizes oh okay this object is now
falling<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.200> one<00:02:01.439> inch<00:02:01.590> then<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.340> takes<00:02:02.490> into

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
falling that one inch then it takes into

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.190 
falling that one inch then it takes into
account<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:03.180> gravity<00:02:03.479> volumes<00:02:03.869> but<00:02:04.049> if<00:02:04.140> you

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
account the gravity volumes but if you

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.959 
account the gravity volumes but if you
put<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.469> crate<00:02:04.710> down<00:02:04.860> on<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.219> ground<00:02:05.430> the

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
put the crate down on the ground the

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.520 
put the crate down on the ground the
game<00:02:06.149> will<00:02:06.299> not<00:02:06.450> have<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.780> calculate<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.409> know

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
game will not have to calculate you know

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.229 
game will not have to calculate you know
how<00:02:07.950> gravity<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:08.399> affecting<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.879> because<00:02:09.090> it's

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
how gravity is affecting it because it's

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.760 
how gravity is affecting it because it's
already<00:02:09.360> sitting<00:02:09.599> on<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.810> ground<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.229> so<00:02:10.679> the

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
already sitting on the ground and so the

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.619 
already sitting on the ground and so the
gravity<00:02:11.069> volumes<00:02:11.400> won't<00:02:11.610> have<00:02:11.760> an<00:02:11.879> effect<00:02:11.970> so

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
gravity volumes won't have an effect so

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.640 
gravity volumes won't have an effect so
that's<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.900> trick<00:02:13.110> you're<00:02:13.260> going<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.440> want

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
that's the trick you're going to want

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.830 
that's the trick you're going to want
keep<00:02:13.799> in<00:02:13.920> mind<00:02:14.129> but<00:02:15.030> as<00:02:15.150> you<00:02:15.239> can<00:02:15.329> see<00:02:15.390> here<00:02:15.720> you

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
keep in mind but as you can see here you

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.600 
keep in mind but as you can see here you
can<00:02:15.959> put<00:02:16.079> virtually<00:02:16.260> any<00:02:16.620> mean<00:02:16.829> any<00:02:17.099> movable

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
can put virtually any mean any movable

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.149 
can put virtually any mean any movable
object<00:02:17.939> and<00:02:18.120> right<00:02:18.629> here<00:02:18.870> this<00:02:19.379> is<00:02:19.650> how<00:02:19.829> we<00:02:19.890> did

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
object and right here this is how we did

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:21.920 
object and right here this is how we did
the<00:02:20.250> Warthog<00:02:20.549> trick<00:02:20.819> on<00:02:21.000> Jurassic<00:02:21.540> Park<00:02:21.780> so

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
the Warthog trick on Jurassic Park so

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.270 
the Warthog trick on Jurassic Park so
many<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.349> had<00:02:22.500> already<00:02:22.620> guessed<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.099> and

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
many of you had already guessed it and

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.100 
many of you had already guessed it and
it's<00:02:23.819> really<00:02:24.030> not<00:02:24.209> that<00:02:24.360> hard<00:02:24.569> just<00:02:24.810> placed<00:02:24.989> on

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
it's really not that hard just placed on

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.720 
it's really not that hard just placed on
a<00:02:25.140> vehicle<00:02:25.379> and<00:02:25.650> then<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.129> gravity<00:02:26.430> volume

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
a vehicle and then the gravity volume

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.559 
a vehicle and then the gravity volume
will<00:02:26.849> move<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:27.120> along

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
will move it along

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:28.910 
will move it along
the<00:02:27.870> only<00:02:27.989> trick<00:02:28.349> is<00:02:28.379> what<00:02:28.709> I<00:02:28.739> was<00:02:28.890> just

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
the only trick is what I was just

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.380 
the only trick is what I was just
talking<00:02:29.370> about<00:02:29.430> about<00:02:29.730> how<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:30.000> have<00:02:30.269> to

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
talking about about how you have to

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.119 
talking about about how you have to
place<00:02:30.569> it<00:02:30.599> a<00:02:30.810> little<00:02:31.079> bit<00:02:31.200> above<00:02:31.500> ground<00:02:31.739> and

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
place it a little bit above ground and

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:33.649 
place it a little bit above ground and
over<00:02:32.670> here<00:02:32.849> for<00:02:33.030> those<00:02:33.090> of<00:02:33.239> you<00:02:33.329> who<00:02:33.480> haven't

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
over here for those of you who haven't

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.199 
over here for those of you who haven't
seen<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.900> drastic<00:02:34.109> park<00:02:34.470> map<00:02:34.680> we<00:02:35.129> made

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
seen a drastic park map we made

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.309 
seen a drastic park map we made
autonomous<00:02:36.209> vehicles<00:02:36.629> here<00:02:36.870> that<00:02:37.049> drove

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
autonomous vehicles here that drove

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:38.929 
autonomous vehicles here that drove
around<00:02:37.409> players<00:02:37.890> could<00:02:38.069> get<00:02:38.189> in<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.549> back<00:02:38.730> in

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939 
around players could get in the back in

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:42.140 
around players could get in the back in
the<00:02:39.090> side<00:02:39.299> and<00:02:40.170> mow<00:02:40.379> down<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:41.099> dinosaurs<00:02:41.670> so

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
the side and mow down the dinosaurs so

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.630 
the side and mow down the dinosaurs so
that<00:02:42.269> was<00:02:42.359> a<00:02:42.390> cool<00:02:42.890> part<00:02:43.890> of<00:02:44.010> our<00:02:44.159> map<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:44.549> we

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
that was a cool part of our map that we

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.920 
that was a cool part of our map that we
really<00:02:44.879> liked<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.540> lot<00:02:45.690> of<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:45.840> were

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
really liked and a lot of you were

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.180 
really liked and a lot of you were
wondering<00:02:46.230> how<00:02:46.290> we<00:02:46.349> did<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:46.769> it's<00:02:46.889> simple

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
wondering how we did it so it's simple

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.369 
wondering how we did it so it's simple
enough<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:47.639> know<00:02:47.730> these<00:02:47.940> gravity<00:02:48.299> volumes<00:02:48.629> if

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
enough you know these gravity volumes if

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:50.899 
enough you know these gravity volumes if
players<00:02:49.709> did<00:02:49.980> jump<00:02:50.250> next<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.579> the<00:02:50.639> Warhawks

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
players did jump next to the Warhawks

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.280 
players did jump next to the Warhawks
they<00:02:51.120> would<00:02:51.239> get<00:02:51.389> pushed<00:02:51.659> that's<00:02:51.959> one<00:02:52.139> of<00:02:52.230> the

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
they would get pushed that's one of the

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.809 
they would get pushed that's one of the
problems<00:02:52.470> right<00:02:53.280> there<00:02:53.430> you<00:02:53.519> can<00:02:53.609> see<00:02:53.730> the

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
problems right there you can see the

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.460 
problems right there you can see the
Mantis<00:02:54.120> was<00:02:54.299> not<00:02:54.510> affected<00:02:54.930> but<00:02:55.049> if<00:02:55.139> you<00:02:55.260> want

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
Mantis was not affected but if you want

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.990 
Mantis was not affected but if you want
it<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.680> be<00:02:55.859> just<00:02:56.310> go<00:02:56.459> ahead<00:02:56.639> and<00:02:56.730> throw<00:02:56.909> in<00:02:56.970> some

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
it to be just go ahead and throw in some

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.879 
it to be just go ahead and throw in some
more<00:02:57.269> gravity<00:02:57.659> volumes<00:02:58.079> also<00:02:58.379> I'll<00:02:58.739> be

more gravity volumes also I'll be

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:01.670 
more gravity volumes also I'll be

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
sort of stetic if you're trying to make

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.860 
sort of stetic if you're trying to make
like<00:03:11.189> a<00:03:11.250> banshee<00:03:11.489> producing<00:03:12.239> factory<00:03:12.659> and<00:03:12.810> you

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
like a banshee producing factory and you

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:13.940 
like a banshee producing factory and you
want<00:03:13.019> an<00:03:13.109> banshees<00:03:13.470> move<00:03:13.650> around<00:03:13.769> in<00:03:13.889> the

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
want an banshees move around in the

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.069 
want an banshees move around in the
background<00:03:14.069> that's<00:03:14.549> cool<00:03:14.849> also<00:03:15.659> another<00:03:15.840> neat

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
background that's cool also another neat

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.629 
background that's cool also another neat
thing<00:03:16.109> we<00:03:16.439> found<00:03:16.590> out<00:03:16.739> is<00:03:16.799> turrets<00:03:17.310> can<00:03:17.489> move

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
thing we found out is turrets can move

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.789 
thing we found out is turrets can move
so<00:03:17.849> place<00:03:18.120> down<00:03:18.329> in<00:03:18.449> turret<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:18.780> maybe<00:03:19.440> have

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
so place down in turret and maybe have

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.170 
so place down in turret and maybe have
like<00:03:19.949> a<00:03:20.010> rollercoaster<00:03:20.340> where<00:03:20.819> your<00:03:20.940> plate

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
like a rollercoaster where your plate

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.599 
like a rollercoaster where your plate
well<00:03:21.449> those<00:03:21.629> will<00:03:21.840> go<00:03:22.410> past<00:03:22.829> like<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.220> loading

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
well those will go past like a loading

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.189 
well those will go past like a loading
area<00:03:23.819> the<00:03:23.940> player<00:03:24.150> sits<00:03:24.389> in<00:03:24.480> it<00:03:24.599> and<00:03:24.750> then<00:03:25.049> it's

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:25.199 
area the player sits in it and then it's

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:26.539 
area the player sits in it and then it's
like<00:03:25.349> a<00:03:25.379> rail<00:03:25.919> shooter'<00:03:26.190> where<00:03:26.430> they're

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
like a rail shooter' where they're

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:27.830 
like a rail shooter' where they're
moving<00:03:26.849> along<00:03:26.970> sliding<00:03:27.449> and<00:03:27.540> they<00:03:27.629> have<00:03:27.720> to

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
moving along sliding and they have to

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.839 
moving along sliding and they have to
shoot<00:03:27.989> at<00:03:28.079> targets<00:03:28.290> oh<00:03:28.620> that's<00:03:28.769> a<00:03:28.949> cool<00:03:29.609> use<00:03:29.819> of

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
shoot at targets oh that's a cool use of

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.300 
shoot at targets oh that's a cool use of
it<00:03:30.169> over<00:03:31.169> here<00:03:31.319> I<00:03:31.349> show<00:03:31.680> you<00:03:31.709> how<00:03:31.889> to<00:03:31.949> make<00:03:32.129> the

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
it over here I show you how to make the

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.369 
it over here I show you how to make the
Train<00:03:32.639> finally<00:03:33.030> so<00:03:33.720> you<00:03:33.810> put<00:03:33.930> down<00:03:34.019> a<00:03:34.079> bunch<00:03:34.290> of

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
Train finally so you put down a bunch of

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.949 
Train finally so you put down a bunch of
blocks<00:03:34.620> here<00:03:34.859> and<00:03:35.040> there<00:03:35.609> on<00:03:35.909> fixed<00:03:36.510> then<00:03:36.930> I

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
blocks here and there on fixed then I

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.809 
blocks here and there on fixed then I
raise<00:03:37.290> them<00:03:37.530> up<00:03:37.650> then<00:03:38.280> what<00:03:38.400> you<00:03:38.519> want<00:03:38.639> to<00:03:38.730> do

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
raise them up then what you want to do

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.610 
raise them up then what you want to do
is<00:03:39.000> go<00:03:39.150> ahead<00:03:39.209> and<00:03:39.299> put<00:03:39.449> them<00:03:39.569> back<00:03:39.750> on<00:03:39.989> normal

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
is go ahead and put them back on normal

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.809 
is go ahead and put them back on normal
without<00:03:40.829> picking<00:03:41.220> them<00:03:41.310> up<00:03:41.430> so<00:03:41.609> I'm<00:03:41.669> just

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
without picking them up so I'm just

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.550 
without picking them up so I'm just
pressing<00:03:42.030> X<00:03:42.329> putting<00:03:42.840> them<00:03:42.930> on<00:03:43.049> normal<00:03:43.440> and

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
pressing X putting them on normal and

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.399 
pressing X putting them on normal and
then<00:03:44.340> what<00:03:44.489> I'm<00:03:44.579> going<00:03:44.729> to<00:03:44.760> do<00:03:44.970> is<00:03:45.180> do<00:03:45.780> spawn

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:46.409 
then what I'm going to do is do spawn

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.439 
then what I'm going to do is do spawn
time<00:03:46.650> 10<00:03:47.040> seconds<00:03:47.400> advance<00:03:47.790> place<00:03:48.090> that<00:03:48.239> start

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.449 
time 10 seconds advance place that start

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:50.839 
time 10 seconds advance place that start
false<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:48.959> that<00:03:49.139> means<00:03:49.430> these<00:03:50.430> won't<00:03:50.639> spawn

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
false and that means these won't spawn

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.189 
false and that means these won't spawn
in<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.060> game<00:03:51.180> until<00:03:51.479> 10<00:03:51.690> seconds<00:03:52.079> which

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199 
in the game until 10 seconds which

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:55.039 
in the game until 10 seconds which
allows<00:03:52.470> me<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:52.709> see<00:03:52.949> them<00:03:53.629> before<00:03:54.629> the<00:03:54.720> loading

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
allows me to see them before the loading

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.509 
allows me to see them before the loading
screen<00:03:55.409> really<00:03:55.650> takes<00:03:55.859> effect<00:03:56.159> so<00:03:56.310> you<00:03:56.370> want

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
screen really takes effect so you want

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:57.920 
screen really takes effect so you want
to<00:03:56.609> save<00:03:56.790> it<00:03:56.819> while<00:03:57.150> your<00:03:57.269> objects<00:03:57.629> are<00:03:57.720> still

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
to save it while your objects are still

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.689 
to save it while your objects are still
floating<00:03:58.260> that<00:03:58.979> way<00:03:59.159> when<00:03:59.310> you<00:03:59.400> start<00:03:59.430> your

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
floating that way when you start your

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.449 
floating that way when you start your
custom<00:04:00.000> game<00:04:00.440> they<00:04:01.440> will<00:04:01.620> spawn<00:04:01.919> floating

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
custom game they will spawn floating

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.759 
custom game they will spawn floating
drop<00:04:02.819> and<00:04:03.120> then<00:04:03.449> what<00:04:03.599> you<00:04:03.690> can<00:04:03.840> see<00:04:04.019> is<00:04:04.260> this

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
drop and then what you can see is this

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.099 
drop and then what you can see is this
so<00:04:05.129> this<00:04:05.760> makes<00:04:06.000> for<00:04:06.150> a<00:04:06.209> really<00:04:06.329> cool<00:04:06.629> train

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
so this makes for a really cool train

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:08.539 
so this makes for a really cool train
what<00:04:07.379> you<00:04:07.440> can<00:04:07.590> do<00:04:07.739> is<00:04:07.859> you<00:04:07.949> can<00:04:08.040> have<00:04:08.250> it<00:04:08.280> for

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
what you can do is you can have it for

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.309 
what you can do is you can have it for
aesthetics<00:04:09.000> like<00:04:09.180> here<00:04:09.449> a<00:04:09.569> minigame<00:04:10.169> where

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
aesthetics like here a minigame where

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.719 
aesthetics like here a minigame where
Indiana<00:04:10.650> Jones<00:04:10.919> is<00:04:11.069> maybe<00:04:11.220> running<00:04:11.459> on<00:04:11.639> the

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:11.729 
Indiana Jones is maybe running on the

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:14.180 
Indiana Jones is maybe running on the
top<00:04:11.940> or<00:04:12.180> you<00:04:12.870> can<00:04:13.019> have<00:04:13.199> it<00:04:13.319> in<00:04:13.530> a<00:04:13.650> race<00:04:13.829> where

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
top or you can have it in a race where

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.770 
top or you can have it in a race where
you<00:04:14.250> know<00:04:14.609> it's<00:04:15.060> kind<00:04:15.269> of<00:04:15.299> like<00:04:15.389> in<00:04:15.510> Mario<00:04:15.750> Kart

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
you know it's kind of like in Mario Kart

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.229 
you know it's kind of like in Mario Kart
in<00:04:16.079> that<00:04:16.229> first<00:04:16.530> desert<00:04:16.919> map<00:04:17.130> on<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.880> original

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
in that first desert map on the original

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.460 
in that first desert map on the original
one<00:04:18.389> we're<00:04:18.840> in<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:18.959> middle<00:04:19.109> of<00:04:19.199> the<00:04:19.289> desert

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
one we're in the middle of the desert

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.589 
one we're in the middle of the desert
there's<00:04:19.949> a<00:04:20.010> train<00:04:20.310> coming<00:04:20.549> through<00:04:20.639> one<00:04:21.570> of

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
there's a train coming through one of

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.600 
there's a train coming through one of
the<00:04:21.750> small<00:04:21.989> caveats<00:04:22.469> for<00:04:22.590> this<00:04:22.830> is<00:04:23.010> the<00:04:23.340> crates

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
the small caveats for this is the crates

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.270 
the small caveats for this is the crates
will<00:04:23.909> respawn<00:04:24.510> so<00:04:25.050> they<00:04:25.320> only<00:04:25.500> travel<00:04:25.830> a<00:04:26.010> sir

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
will respawn so they only travel a sir

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.280 
will respawn so they only travel a sir
distance<00:04:26.580> before<00:04:26.730> resetting<00:04:27.270> so<00:04:27.870> if<00:04:27.990> you<00:04:28.110> want

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
distance before resetting so if you want

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.810 
distance before resetting so if you want
them<00:04:28.440> to<00:04:28.590> go<00:04:28.710> all<00:04:29.040> the<00:04:29.070> way<00:04:29.220> along<00:04:29.400> your<00:04:29.580> track

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
them to go all the way along your track

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:30.950 
them to go all the way along your track
you're<00:04:30.030> going<00:04:30.150> to<00:04:30.210> have<00:04:30.300> to<00:04:30.420> have<00:04:30.540> them<00:04:30.660> spawn

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
you're going to have to have them spawn

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.170 
you're going to have to have them spawn
a<00:04:30.990> little<00:04:31.440> closer<00:04:31.680> to<00:04:31.980> this<00:04:32.150> crossing<00:04:33.150> point

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
a little closer to this crossing point

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.790 
a little closer to this crossing point
here<00:04:33.600> so<00:04:33.630> that's<00:04:33.930> something<00:04:34.139> we<00:04:34.350> encountered

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
here so that's something we encountered

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.020 
here so that's something we encountered
that<00:04:35.220> you're<00:04:35.310> going<00:04:35.430> to<00:04:35.460> want<00:04:35.580> to<00:04:35.669> take<00:04:35.820> into

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
that you're going to want to take into

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.030 
that you're going to want to take into
account<00:04:36.200> here's<00:04:37.200> another<00:04:37.380> example<00:04:37.530> of<00:04:37.860> some

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
account here's another example of some

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.620 
account here's another example of some
sort<00:04:38.220> of<00:04:38.250> minigame<00:04:38.639> where<00:04:39.120> these<00:04:39.300> might<00:04:39.510> be

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
sort of minigame where these might be

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.690 
sort of minigame where these might be
forcing<00:04:40.200> you<00:04:40.290> along<00:04:40.650> a<00:04:40.680> track<00:04:41.040> and<00:04:41.250> they<00:04:41.550> can

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
forcing you along a track and they can

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.460 
forcing you along a track and they can
even<00:04:41.790> do<00:04:41.970> damage<00:04:42.300> now<00:04:42.960> over<00:04:43.139> here<00:04:43.320> is<00:04:43.440> a

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
even do damage now over here is a

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.290 
even do damage now over here is a
conjunction<00:04:43.889> of<00:04:44.070> our<00:04:44.340> unlimited<00:04:44.760> vehicle

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
conjunction of our unlimited vehicle

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.350 
conjunction of our unlimited vehicle
glitch<00:04:45.510> as<00:04:45.690> well<00:04:46.410> as<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:47.460> moving<00:04:47.669> vehicle<00:04:47.910> so

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
glitch as well as the moving vehicle so

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.400 
glitch as well as the moving vehicle so
you<00:04:48.389> can<00:04:48.480> do<00:04:48.750> this<00:04:48.900> for<00:04:49.080> all<00:04:49.139> sorts<00:04:49.320> of

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
you can do this for all sorts of

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.020 
you can do this for all sorts of
minigames<00:04:49.710> here<00:04:50.070> we<00:04:50.220> pulled<00:04:50.460> off<00:04:50.580> a<00:04:50.610> sort<00:04:50.970> of

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
minigames here we pulled off a sort of

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.150 
minigames here we pulled off a sort of
Frogger<00:04:51.330> map<00:04:51.660> so<00:04:51.930> again<00:04:52.169> I<00:04:52.350> will<00:04:52.830> link<00:04:53.010> you
