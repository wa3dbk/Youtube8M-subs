better I decided to rest my tractor on
these<00:00:12.269> blocks<00:00:12.750> here<00:00:13.349> where<00:00:14.250> my<00:00:14.400> foot<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:15.320> but

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
these blocks here where my foot is but

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.349 
these blocks here where my foot is but
these<00:00:16.650> weights<00:00:16.980> have<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.340> come<00:00:17.520> off<00:00:17.760> in<00:00:18.029> order

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
these weights have to come off in order

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.840 
these weights have to come off in order
to<00:00:18.510> get<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.869> side<00:00:19.140> rails<00:00:19.439> off<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.220> side<00:00:20.550> rails

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
to get the side rails off the side rails

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.910 
to get the side rails off the side rails
here<00:00:21.090> they<00:00:21.270> have<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.539> come<00:00:21.689> off<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.080> being

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
here they have to come off and being

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.200 
here they have to come off and being
held<00:00:23.250> on<00:00:23.430> by<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.869> the<00:00:24.869> weight<00:00:25.050> bracket<00:00:26.180> so<00:00:27.180> I

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
held on by the the weight bracket so I

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.700 
held on by the the weight bracket so I
have<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.449> hard<00:00:27.750> time<00:00:28.080> getting<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.470> thing

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
have a hard time getting this thing

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.139 
have a hard time getting this thing
jacked<00:00:29.429> up<00:00:29.699> because<00:00:31.460> when<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.550> let<00:00:32.910> the

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
jacked up because when I let the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.660 
jacked up because when I let the
pressure<00:00:33.600> off<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.680> it's<00:00:35.100> going<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.399> want<00:00:35.550> to

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
pressure off of it it's going to want to

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.729 
pressure off of it it's going to want to
tilt<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.300> right<00:00:36.390> or<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.780> left<00:00:37.110> because<00:00:37.559> it

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
tilt to the right or the left because it

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.619 
tilt to the right or the left because it
pivots<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> center<00:00:38.579> for<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.820> front

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
pivots in the center for the front

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.900 
pivots in the center for the front
wheels<00:00:39.890> so<00:00:40.890> I'm<00:00:41.010> going<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.250> have<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.610> come<00:00:41.879> up

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
wheels so I'm going to have to come up

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.410 
wheels so I'm going to have to come up
with<00:00:42.059> something<00:00:42.980> to<00:00:43.980> stabilize<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:45.059> before

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
with something to stabilize that before

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.799 
with something to stabilize that before
I<00:00:45.450> can<00:00:45.600> rest<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.789> rested<00:00:47.789> on<00:00:47.910> here<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:48.570> I'm

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
I can rest the rested on here so I'm

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.950 
I can rest the rested on here so I'm
having<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.110> little<00:00:49.200> trouble<00:00:49.910> but<00:00:50.910> it's<00:00:51.840> really

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
having a little trouble but it's really

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.299 
having a little trouble but it's really
no<00:00:52.140> big<00:00:52.289> deal<00:00:52.500> everything<00:00:52.770> else<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.190> going

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
no big deal everything else is going

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.439 
no big deal everything else is going
pretty<00:00:53.520> good<00:00:53.789> I'm<00:00:53.940> going<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.090> take<00:00:54.270> that

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
pretty good I'm going to take that

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.330 
pretty good I'm going to take that
radiator<00:00:54.899> out<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.289> there<00:00:55.410> here<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.129> next

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
radiator out of there here in the next

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.209 
radiator out of there here in the next
few<00:00:56.520> minutes<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.649> figure<00:00:58.649> out<00:00:58.710> how<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.920> block

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
few minutes and figure out how to block

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.680 
few minutes and figure out how to block
that<00:00:59.399> up<00:00:59.550> properly<00:00:59.910> then<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.300> motor<00:01:00.480> should

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
that up properly then that motor should

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.990 
that up properly then that motor should
just<00:01:00.870> pop<00:01:01.050> right<00:01:01.109> out<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.469> there<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.670> I'll<00:01:02.879> be

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
just pop right out of there and I'll be

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.969 
just pop right out of there and I'll be
putting<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.300> new<00:01:03.390> one<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.799> probably<00:01:04.799> within

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
putting the new one in probably within

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:05.630 
putting the new one in probably within
the<00:01:05.100> hour

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
the hour

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.539 
the hour
so<00:01:06.000> anyhow<00:01:06.780> that's<00:01:07.650> just<00:01:07.920> an<00:01:08.040> update<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.460> the

should<00:02:30.510> be<00:02:30.950> we're<00:02:31.950> doing<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.280> we're<00:02:32.430> lining<00:02:32.820> up

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
should be we're doing is we're lining up

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.700 
should be we're doing is we're lining up
the<00:02:33.530> oil<00:02:34.530> pump<00:02:34.890> here<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.430> just<00:02:36.320> got<00:02:37.320> a<00:02:37.350> free

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
the oil pump here I just got a free

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.780 
the oil pump here I just got a free
second<00:02:38.130> here<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.310> can<00:02:38.580> take<00:02:39.090> some<00:02:39.300> video<00:02:39.570> we're

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
second here I can take some video we're

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.190 
second here I can take some video we're
lining<00:02:41.790> up<00:02:41.910> is<00:02:42.030> oil<00:02:42.270> pump<00:02:42.510> it<00:02:42.870> shouldn't<00:02:43.140> be

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
lining up is oil pump it shouldn't be

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.320 
lining up is oil pump it shouldn't be
too<00:02:43.350> hard<00:02:43.380> I<00:02:43.890> did<00:02:44.760> have<00:02:44.970> a<00:02:45.000> little<00:02:45.210> trouble

out so I had to get on a local auto
parts<00:03:00.990> store<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:01.560> got<00:03:01.650> some<00:03:01.710> 3/8<00:03:02.370> brake

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
parts store and I got some 3/8 brake

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.750 
parts store and I got some 3/8 brake
line<00:03:03.140> put<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.350> in<00:03:04.530> there<00:03:04.770> bent<00:03:05.400> it<00:03:05.550> to<00:03:05.670> the

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
line put that in there bent it to the

goes around there presses on and you got
to<00:04:32.040> do<00:04:32.160> that<00:04:32.340> all<00:04:32.640> without<00:04:32.880> taking<00:04:33.270> it<00:04:33.540> apart

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
to do that all without taking it apart

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.420 
to do that all without taking it apart
because<00:04:34.050> it<00:04:34.320> comes<00:04:34.500> together<00:04:34.710> with<00:04:35.070> the<00:04:35.190> seal

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
because it comes together with the seal

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.330 
because it comes together with the seal
real<00:04:36.300> pain

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
real pain

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.879 
real pain
so<00:04:37.760> that'll<00:04:38.060> be<00:04:38.150> the<00:04:38.240> next<00:04:38.360> thing<00:04:38.570> I<00:04:38.720> do<00:04:38.889> and

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
so that'll be the next thing I do and

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.830
