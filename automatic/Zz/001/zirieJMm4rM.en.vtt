00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.840 
we're just basically two-dimensional
graphics<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.710> that's<00:02:22.160> about<00:02:22.370> it<00:02:22.610> and

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
graphics and and that's about it and

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.090 
graphics and and that's about it and
then<00:02:23.240> to<00:02:23.390> see<00:02:23.630> where<00:02:23.840> it's<00:02:24.380> come<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:24.800> today

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
then to see where it's come to today

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.400 
then to see where it's come to today
especially<00:02:25.880> I<00:02:25.910> remember<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.690> first<00:02:27.080> video

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
especially I remember the first video

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.290 
especially I remember the first video
game<00:02:27.620> that<00:02:27.650> I<00:02:27.830> was<00:02:28.130> in<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:28.580> this<00:02:29.090> would<00:02:29.240> have

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
game that I was in and this would have

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.580 
game that I was in and this would have
been<00:02:29.420> like<00:02:29.830> 1998<00:02:30.830> on<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.490> ps1<00:02:31.940> and<00:02:32.440> then<00:02:33.440> to

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
been like 1998 on the ps1 and then to

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.440 
been like 1998 on the ps1 and then to
see<00:02:33.830> where<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.130> is<00:02:34.190> today<00:02:34.490> and<00:02:34.880> how<00:02:35.030> much<00:02:35.210> more

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
see where it is today and how much more

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.530 
see where it is today and how much more
realistic<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.850> how<00:02:37.850> much<00:02:38.030> better<00:02:38.330> the

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
realistic and how much better the

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.140 
realistic and how much better the
animations<00:02:39.230> are<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:39.740> how<00:02:40.250> much<00:02:40.430> more<00:02:40.670> complex

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
animations are and how much more complex

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.960 
animations are and how much more complex
the<00:02:41.420> gameplay<00:02:41.900> is<00:02:42.140> just<00:02:42.470> as<00:02:42.590> far<00:02:42.830> as<00:02:43.100> the

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
the gameplay is just as far as the

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.640 
the gameplay is just as far as the
things<00:02:44.240> that<00:02:44.390> you<00:02:44.480> can<00:02:44.630> do<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.440> move

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
things that you can do and the move

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.590 
things that you can do and the move
combinations<00:02:46.490> and<00:02:46.700> sets<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.270> things<00:02:47.390> like

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
combinations and sets and things like

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.890 
combinations and sets and things like
that

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
that

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.690 
that
it's<00:02:48.800> it's<00:02:49.190> just<00:02:49.459> incredible<00:02:50.330> I<00:02:51.310> was<00:02:52.310> one<00:02:52.490> time

I'm not as hardcore they used to be I
used<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:37.739> play<00:03:37.860> all<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.220> time<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.700> he's

plenty anything
I<00:03:39.870> also<00:03:40.290> else<00:03:40.920> like<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.280> sports<00:03:41.580> games

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
I also else like the sports games

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.309 
I also else like the sports games
especially<00:03:43.319> like<00:03:43.800> the<00:03:44.810> football<00:03:45.810> games<00:03:46.050> and

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
especially like the football games and

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.130 
especially like the football games and
used<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.280> be<00:03:47.370> big<00:03:47.580> into<00:03:47.910> in<00:03:48.150> fact<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.780> lot<00:03:48.930> of<00:03:48.959> the

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
used to be big into in fact a lot of the

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.890 
used to be big into in fact a lot of the
guys<00:03:49.319> were<00:03:49.560> actually<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:50.510> play<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:51.569> football

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.900 
guys were actually a play to football
games<00:03:51.930> too<00:03:52.349> but<00:03:52.920> I'm<00:03:53.250> probably<00:03:53.459> somewhere<00:03:53.819> in

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
games too but I'm probably somewhere in

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:54.640 
games too but I'm probably somewhere in
the<00:03:53.970> middle

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
the middle

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.020 
the middle

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.600 
[Applause]
I<00:03:58.319> think<00:03:59.319> it's<00:03:59.500> important<00:04:00.069> for<00:04:00.190> people<00:04:00.340> of

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
I think it's important for people of

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.270 
I think it's important for people of
course<00:04:00.880> to<00:04:01.150> uh<00:04:01.500> you<00:04:02.500> know<00:04:02.530> be<00:04:02.620> moderate<00:04:03.190> and

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
course to uh you know be moderate and

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.710 
course to uh you know be moderate and
everything<00:04:03.640> they<00:04:03.760> do<00:04:03.940> so<00:04:04.180> I<00:04:04.240> wouldn't<00:04:04.540> have<00:04:04.660> to

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
everything they do so I wouldn't have to

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.210 
everything they do so I wouldn't have to
get<00:04:04.959> anyone<00:04:05.319> spending<00:04:05.680> all<00:04:05.800> their<00:04:05.920> time<00:04:05.980> in

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
get anyone spending all their time in

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.130 
get anyone spending all their time in
front<00:04:06.610> of<00:04:06.700> uh<00:04:06.880> you<00:04:07.300> know<00:04:07.450> in<00:04:07.780> front<00:04:07.930> of<00:04:08.020> a

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
front of uh you know in front of a

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.960

television playing video games but by

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.390 
television playing video games but by
the<00:04:10.030> same<00:04:10.240> token<00:04:10.300> I<00:04:10.690> think<00:04:10.720> you<00:04:11.290> know<00:04:11.410> it's<00:04:12.280> a

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
the same token I think you know it's a
