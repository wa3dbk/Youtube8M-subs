00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.049
 time Professor rafael marques after 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.760
 down here in the ui are sportive 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.590
 I want to have a chat today 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.110
 once again of the protein group and 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.490
 anabolic situation I want to draw 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.029
 attention to ask a question is the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.330
 next the euro is yes or no boy 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:27.000
 my answer is no, because we are going 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:29.760
 I did it yesterday and I did not do it. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.530
 how long is the day you go away 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:40.410
 now it will not feed anymore 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:42.329
 of the day you're going to go jogging and 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.940
 then do the feeding you will gain 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.020
 muscles faster and more 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.280
 efficiency 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.770
 so what I want to draw attention to 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.829
 here in my opinion and is not the guy in the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.350
 ball he is a flag on boy what 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.640
 makes us grow food or not 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.129
 You need to leave your gym. 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.170
 protein size over years 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.510
 feed or eat crap like 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.510
 empty calories or eating fry 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.729
 no milk with chocolate and 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.320
 take a potent and gifted show this 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.900
 It will not make you grow 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.460
 always remember the process of 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.460
 Recovery of the game is not even 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.330
 immediately after training he started 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.240
 with the hard outer be 24 hours or the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.670
 people who want to do 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.729
 subway process in the show are in 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.640
 constant recovery period 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.579
 What is the recovery time that starts 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.890
 when it ends up having and ending when 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.950
 the next training period begins 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.340
 that is 24 hours does not remember if well and I went 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.579
 pro tem has been married to a good one 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.710
 good diet with good no 3 calculated by 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.869
 Your Nutritionist High Protein 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.090
 low-carbohydrate biological value of 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.490
 always very much in society 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.430
 besides another important tip I went 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.350
 pro has to pay attention on the grass 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.590
 of protein does not come out buying 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.079
 any one 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.539
 qualified to show those who 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.550
 today contaminates the leucine tones that 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.800
 amino acid does not die then exchange is 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.980
 important for you to have the 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.450
 result you want is shimo 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.129
 protein synthesis 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.260
 So to summarize our speech in my 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.340
 opinion I have was not soft it's a 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.680
 flare gun 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.900
 it is accompanied by a good diet in the 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.700
 after training and throughout the 24 hours 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.680
 there is no need to leave either 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.080
 desperately after training and 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.780
 take your protein this first 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.280
 stronger window to soft water in stone 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.349
 lasts three hours 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.569
 so do not be doing landing 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.519
 academy is the message that the guy is 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.900
 here for you is prudence in food 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:49.599
 does not work 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.599
 A hug to everyone and it's always goodbye.
