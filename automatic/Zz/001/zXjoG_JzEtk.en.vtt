00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.590 
bagasse corn stover corn stover you said
is<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.930> leftover<00:00:44.149> of<00:00:45.149> corn<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.480> you

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
is the leftover of corn that you

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.569 
is the leftover of corn that you
wouldn't<00:00:45.870> eat<00:00:46.079> right<00:00:46.739> yeah<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.129> grow<00:00:47.399> with

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
wouldn't eat right yeah you grow with

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.130 
wouldn't eat right yeah you grow with
you<00:00:47.760> grow<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.030> corn<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.420> take<00:00:48.570> off<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.930> cob

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
you grow the corn you take off the cob

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.139 
you grow the corn you take off the cob
and<00:00:49.469> basically<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.280> realest<00:00:50.670> left<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.030> the

and basically the realest left is the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.660 
and basically the realest left is the
corn<00:00:51.390> stover<00:00:51.629> right<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:53.010> these<00:00:53.129> are<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.399> kind

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670

the biomass waste the biomass comes in

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.410 
the biomass waste the biomass comes in
