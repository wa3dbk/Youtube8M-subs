00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.699
 we all made super super practical 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.089
 easy first of all we use a few 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.090
 mantecadas that here in Mexico are called 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:34.230
 shortbread bimbo pancakes 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:37.470
 Vanilla flavor in any corner this 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.220
 then we are using ones I also 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.530
 I bought them made in the super are 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.949
 very good and we are also going to use there 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.350
 zinc that I already have it here ready there 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:52.739
 Zinc zinc white color 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.670
 black for the eyes and for the mouth and 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.010
 a little bit of sugar then let's go 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.019
 to do our elaboration I hope that 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.300
 you like the first thing that I'm going to teach you 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:10.270
 to do is to decorate the meringue 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:13.000
 then let's take some zinc 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:17.100
 we're going to do it in three parts first 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.100
 let's put in the lighting base 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.010
 and you're going to flatten it a bit 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.159
 to be the basis of the project of the 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.420
 ghost 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.420
 if you find 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.470
 a meringue so it suits more to the 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.830
 body because it's great 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.700
 They were very chatitos I bought them 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.700
 in the supermarket 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.640
 already how could 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:08.810
 with the bimbo shortcakes that on the 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.880
 corner of my house the first thing I did 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:15.730
 was to cut the piquito 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.730
 Now that the meringue has been sitting well 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.690
 and then 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.690
 with a little icing sugar 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.939
 the bathe with icing sugar 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.939
 they look white too 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.630
 remember this is icing sugar or sugar 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.630
 impalpable 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.220
 and we are going to put 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.160
 again the lighting 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.920
