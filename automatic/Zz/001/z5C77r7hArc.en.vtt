longboarding and I'm here to give you
guys<00:00:11.019> a<00:00:11.049> review<00:00:11.230> of<00:00:11.650> the<00:00:12.639> bones<00:00:13.139> super<00:00:14.139> 6<00:00:14.950> swiss

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
guys a review of the bones super 6 swiss

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.560 
guys a review of the bones super 6 swiss
alright<00:00:17.080> now<00:00:17.580> one<00:00:18.580> key<00:00:18.790> feature<00:00:19.000> about<00:00:19.390> these

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
alright now one key feature about these

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.690 
alright now one key feature about these
bearings<00:00:20.050> is<00:00:20.320> that<00:00:20.590> there<00:00:20.800> are<00:00:20.980> six<00:00:21.430> balls

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:21.700 
bearings is that there are six balls

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.200 
bearings is that there are six balls
instead<00:00:22.270> of<00:00:22.509> seven<00:00:22.900> on<00:00:23.079> the<00:00:23.200> average<00:00:23.500> bearing

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
instead of seven on the average bearing

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.240 
instead of seven on the average bearing
benefits<00:00:25.210> of<00:00:25.390> this<00:00:25.539> is<00:00:25.900> you<00:00:26.710> can<00:00:26.890> accelerate

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
benefits of this is you can accelerate

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.060 
benefits of this is you can accelerate
faster<00:00:28.090> and<00:00:28.330> you<00:00:28.449> can<00:00:28.599> maintain<00:00:29.500> a<00:00:29.769> higher

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
faster and you can maintain a higher

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.130 
faster and you can maintain a higher
speed<00:00:30.490> for<00:00:30.789> a<00:00:30.820> longer<00:00:31.179> period<00:00:31.359> of<00:00:31.539> time<00:00:31.840> and

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
speed for a longer period of time and

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.119 
speed for a longer period of time and
there's<00:00:32.860> also<00:00:33.070> a<00:00:33.250> longer<00:00:33.580> durability<00:00:35.129> so

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
there's also a longer durability so

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.000 
there's also a longer durability so
basically<00:00:36.580> these<00:00:37.420> bearings<00:00:37.989> they<00:00:38.710> were<00:00:38.769> made

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
basically these bearings they were made

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.700 
basically these bearings they were made
in<00:00:39.160> Sweden<00:00:39.790> so<00:00:40.210> for<00:00:40.870> those<00:00:40.960> of<00:00:41.019> you<00:00:41.350> who<00:00:41.530> don't

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
in Sweden so for those of you who don't

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.930 
in Sweden so for those of you who don't
like<00:00:41.920> other<00:00:42.360> foreign<00:00:44.489> products<00:00:45.489> not<00:00:45.729> going<00:00:45.879> to

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
like other foreign products not going to

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:51.539 
mention any countries in offense but um
yeah<00:00:49.269> so<00:00:49.839> these<00:00:49.989> are<00:00:50.170> made<00:00:50.290> in<00:00:50.440> Sweden<00:00:50.680> so<00:00:51.190> you

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:51.549 
yeah so these are made in Sweden so you

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:55.590 
yeah so these are made in Sweden so you
know<00:00:51.699> there's<00:00:52.059> a<00:00:52.119> good<00:00:52.239> stuff<00:00:53.040> also<00:00:54.040> that<00:00:55.000> they

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
know there's a good stuff also that they

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.189 
know there's a good stuff also that they
cost<00:00:55.839> about<00:00:56.170> 58<00:00:57.070> dollars<00:00:57.339> um<00:00:58.000> as<00:00:58.420> you<00:00:58.900> can<00:00:58.930> see

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
cost about 58 dollars um as you can see

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.619 
cost about 58 dollars um as you can see
there<00:00:59.500> is<00:00:59.650> no<00:01:00.010> back<00:01:00.339> shield<00:01:00.790> it's<00:01:01.119> just<00:01:01.479> that

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
there is no back shield it's just that

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.229 
there is no back shield it's just that
rubber<00:01:01.900> protector<00:01:02.470> but<00:01:03.250> the<00:01:03.369> front<00:01:03.699> does<00:01:03.970> have

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
rubber protector but the front does have

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.250 
rubber protector but the front does have
the<00:01:04.449> removable<00:01:04.720> blue<00:01:05.470> shield<00:01:05.770> as<00:01:06.040> you<00:01:06.189> can<00:01:06.369> see

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the removable blue shield as you can see

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.279 
the removable blue shield as you can see
these<00:01:08.260> do<00:01:08.530> not<00:01:08.560> come<00:01:08.740> with<00:01:09.040> spacers<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.900> if

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:11.289 
these do not come with spacers so if

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:13.469 
these do not come with spacers so if
you're<00:01:11.560> looking<00:01:12.429> for<00:01:12.549> spacers<00:01:13.030> you<00:01:13.060> want<00:01:13.390> to

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
you're looking for spacers you want to

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.389 
you're looking for spacers you want to
take<00:01:13.630> more<00:01:13.899> care<00:01:14.140> of<00:01:14.380> your<00:01:14.530> wheels<00:01:14.770> probably

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
take more care of your wheels probably

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:17.929 
take more care of your wheels probably
reduce<00:01:15.700> all<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:16.030> stress<00:01:16.299> on<00:01:16.450> there<00:01:16.679> you<00:01:17.679> can

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
reduce all the stress on there you can

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.889 
reduce all the stress on there you can
find<00:01:18.939> them<00:01:19.090> really<00:01:19.329> you<00:01:19.420> can<00:01:19.570> get<00:01:19.630> them<00:01:19.780> in<00:01:19.840> a

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
find them really you can get them in a

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.200 
find them really you can get them in a
skate<00:01:20.140> shop<00:01:20.170> you<00:01:20.679> can<00:01:20.829> get<00:01:21.009> them<00:01:21.130> off<00:01:21.369> a<00:01:21.429> retail

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
skate shop you can get them off a retail

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.849 
skate shop you can get them off a retail
store<00:01:22.479> it's<00:01:22.869> nothing<00:01:23.229> really<00:01:23.350> big<00:01:23.649> and

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:23.859 
store it's nothing really big and

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:25.679 
store it's nothing really big and
expensive<00:01:24.130> it's<00:01:24.609> like<00:01:24.670> three<00:01:25.179> dollars<00:01:25.479> I

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
expensive it's like three dollars I

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.429 
expensive it's like three dollars I
think<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:27.670> you<00:01:27.729> got<00:01:28.149> those<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:28.840> performance

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
think so you got those the performance

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.529 
think so you got those the performance
of<00:01:29.590> these<00:01:29.710> are<00:01:30.009> really<00:01:30.609> good<00:01:30.820> they're<00:01:31.450> gonna

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
of these are really good they're gonna

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.480 
of these are really good they're gonna
last<00:01:31.840> a<00:01:32.049> nice<00:01:32.380> long<00:01:32.829> time<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.950> lubrication

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
last a nice long time the lubrication

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.319 
last a nice long time the lubrication
isn't<00:01:36.999> that<00:01:37.149> good<00:01:37.420> but<00:01:38.289> uh<00:01:38.319> like<00:01:39.310> right<00:01:39.579> out<00:01:40.270> of

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
isn't that good but uh like right out of

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.779 
isn't that good but uh like right out of
the<00:01:40.479> box<00:01:40.659> it's<00:01:41.020> about<00:01:41.259> 27<00:01:41.950> seconds<00:01:42.549> and<00:01:42.700> when

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
the box it's about 27 seconds and when

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:44.340 
the box it's about 27 seconds and when
you<00:01:42.880> break<00:01:43.119> them<00:01:43.270> in<00:01:43.450> it<00:01:43.630> can<00:01:43.810> get<00:01:43.899> pretty<00:01:44.049> high

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
you break them in it can get pretty high

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.279 
you break them in it can get pretty high
they<00:01:45.069> come<00:01:45.280> lubed<00:01:45.640> with<00:01:46.119> the<00:01:46.659> bone<00:01:46.840> swiss

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
they come lubed with the bone swiss

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.279 
they come lubed with the bone swiss
speed<00:01:47.679> cream<00:01:48.039> so<00:01:48.969> you<00:01:49.509> can<00:01:49.719> know<00:01:49.869> that<00:01:50.109> these

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
speed cream so you can know that these

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:51.510 
speed cream so you can know that these
things<00:01:50.469> are<00:01:50.619> gonna<00:01:50.740> have<00:01:50.979> some<00:01:51.189> seriously

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
things are gonna have some seriously

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.050 
things are gonna have some seriously
good<00:01:51.609> speed<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:54.009> yeah<00:01:54.340> these<00:01:54.520> are<00:01:54.670> all<00:01:54.789> around

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
good speed so yeah these are all around

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.830 
good speed so yeah these are all around
great<00:01:55.240> bearings<00:01:55.810> good<00:01:56.710> for<00:01:56.979> speed<00:01:57.399> and<00:01:57.749> so<00:01:58.749> if

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
great bearings good for speed and so if

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.959 
great bearings good for speed and so if
you<00:01:58.960> go<00:01:59.049> into<00:01:59.229> a<00:01:59.319> race<00:01:59.619> with<00:01:59.920> someone<00:02:00.399> you'll

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
you go into a race with someone you'll

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:02.940 
you go into a race with someone you'll
probably<00:02:01.299> win<00:02:01.869> unless<00:02:02.170> they<00:02:02.469> have<00:02:02.649> like

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
probably win unless they have like

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.489 
probably win unless they have like
ceramic<00:02:03.579> bearings<00:02:03.789> like<00:02:04.090> bone<00:02:04.389> swiss<00:02:04.780> but

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:05.499 
ceramic bearings like bone swiss but

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:06.929 
ceramic bearings like bone swiss but
yeah<00:02:05.740> these<00:02:05.950> things<00:02:06.009> they'll<00:02:06.579> give<00:02:06.729> you<00:02:06.819> the

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
yeah these things they'll give you the

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:08.520 
yeah these things they'll give you the
speed<00:02:07.209> you<00:02:07.389> want<00:02:07.630> as<00:02:07.810> long<00:02:07.899> as<00:02:08.050> you<00:02:08.229> got<00:02:08.380> the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
speed you want as long as you got the

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.859 
speed you want as long as you got the
muscle<00:02:08.830> to<00:02:08.950> provide<00:02:09.250> it<00:02:09.490> so<00:02:10.149> thanks<00:02:10.720> for
