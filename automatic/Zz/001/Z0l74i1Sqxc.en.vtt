00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.920
Sup baby!

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:15.900
This week we breaking it down with the Sound
and the Fury by William Faulkner.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.240
Things ain't going so hot for the Compson
family, solid street cred and fat stacks of

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.550
that cold hard cash goin' to sh*t!

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.740
And speaking of sh*t, this story is a straight
clusterf*ck!

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.460
It's allll outta order.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.680
And if that ain't enough we gettin the low-down
from the three crazy Compson brothers: Benjy,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.399
who ain't right in the head, Quentin, the
obsessive brainiac, and Jason, who always

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.969
actin' like he got a stick up his ass.

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.729
The youngest brother, Benjy, ain't makin'
sense of the world like most hustlers.

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:50.699
Errytime this fool touch, hear, or smell somethin',
he get thrown back to memories of his fine

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:51.699
sister, Caddy.

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.530
Back then, Bejny would start wiggin out whenever
he would catch a whiff of Caddy skankin it

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.690
up with some local hoods.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.749
Too bad for him, girl gets knocked up.

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:04.970
Bejny's older brother, Quentin, in a funk
when hear that not only is Caddy lost her

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.300
V-card, but she bout to marry some scrub named
Herbert to cover up the shame.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.040
He all like, "No, girl!

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.829
Don't even think about doing that sh*t!

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:17.120
We should tell everyone we banged each other,
then bounce!"

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.790
But Caddy tell Quentin that she don't want
to play that game.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:26.140
Sick of his bleak-ass existence, Quentin tosses
his ass right off into the Charles River.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.689
He DEAD.

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.950
But since Willie don't give a Faulk, he gotta
confuse the hell out of you by introducing

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.329
another character named Quentin: Caddy's baby
girl who the Compsons adopt.

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.740
With most everybody dead, Jason gotta run
the Compson carnival and raise Miss Quentin.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.219
And that fool so ice cold that he jacks just
about all that change Caddy frontin' for Missy

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:48.219
Q.

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:51.799
But it ain't long before Miss Quentin done
dealin' with Jason's bullsh*t.

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.539
She busts outta that house, boosts a stack
of Jason's paper and chucks dueces outta town.

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.170
As Jason hits the streets lookin' for Miss
Quentin, Dilsey, the Compson's maid, takes

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.490
Benjy to church, where some out of town preacher
lays down some righteous Gospel.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.800
Later, Benjy ridin' dirty in the family whip,
gets smacked up by Jason, and keeps cruisin'.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.370
When it comes to readin' and not knowin' what
the HELL is goin on, this text brings it to

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.430
the next level, B.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.650
We given four different perspectives throughout
this mess.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.730
First is Benjy, the simple fool who stuck
in a timeless present where words like Past

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.490
and Future ain't mean a damn thing.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.690
Then there's the obsessive Quentin, who got
such a ragin' hard on for the past AND his

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.420
sister, that he ain't got no future.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.580
And Jason, that gibroni, always blamin' other
people for his problems.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.210
He spent so much time bitchin' about the future
that he ain't even got no now!

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.530
But the last section of this book ain't like
the others.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.930
The 4th part reads nice and smooth.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.620
Lots of scholarly homies call it Dilsey's
section, since she in the spotlight.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.780
Dilsey don't sweat time like the sad ass Compson
crew.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:03.780
Nah!

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.650
She got mad love for the big G and Christianity
so instead of looking just the past present

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.180
and future, she all about eternity.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.380
And you know what?

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.660
This book so damn confusing and jacked up,
it takes an eternity to read!

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.450
Plus, nothing even happens- the hell?

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.970
See, most books got a central complication
that drives the story.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.500
But up in here, there ain't no central event,
playa.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.620
So what's the point?

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.260
Well, maybe that is the point!

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.420
If you bust out your copy of Macbeth, you
can check where Faulkner got  the title from.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.340
Just like MacBeezy sayin' about life, this
book just a bunch of jabbering that don't

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.240
signify a damn thing.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.109
But that don't mean the book saying life is
meaningless.

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:57.109
Nah, blood!

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:01.510
The book got words that rep meaning, but it's
meaning that words can't communicate.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.799
Maybe Faulkner dropped us a lil something
bout how we supposed to read this bad boy.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.380
Peep the good Reverend spittin' mad game at
his sermon...

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.560
Sometimes words ain't good enough to describe
life's ups and downs.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:41.190
Sometimes you just gotta feel it, playa.
