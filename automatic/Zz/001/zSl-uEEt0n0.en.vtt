00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:09.090
 Tell me the French here with 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:11.130
 tip will refer to electric locks 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.500
 It's just to do the tests of 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.850
 all I need to make a 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.550
 procedure so that with the door open 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:28.710
 Is it possible to simply lower my tire? 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:30.769
 pick up here pushes that lock on the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.769
 door 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:40.530
 This defect that I 'm going to show here 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:43.379
 you are a very common effect many 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.399
 sometimes it is necessary to make a cut in the 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.450
 thread 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:51.750
 in the case of this exchanged electric lock 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:01:00.480
 positron began to appear some 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:01:02.670
 installation problems . 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:10.680
 personnel of the concessionaire looks only at 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:14.670
 they do is due to the issue of the 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.299
 The movie is passing through here. 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.530
 usually the door and you need to 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:33.650
 wire to power to the cabin with him 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:33.650
 pass these cuts to handle cuts 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:42.899
 remember that the amendment should be 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.250
 always made with the help of an iron 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:50.549
 soldering 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:52.590
 with time these wires have been generating 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.920
 a series of bad contact 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.420
 in the case of this lock it was every time 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.689
 which related to open 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.549
 it would automatically close as if 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:08.960
 were strength 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:10.910
 this is a symptom of bad contact on the wires 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:17.560
 is looking here to enter not yet 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:23.600
 I realized that they made this cut here 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:26.660
 is the following one sees that it has here the wire 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.780
 white spliced ​​with red being 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.990
 it was meant to be integers because that 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.870
 because it simply cut there in the 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:41.000
 door 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:45.140
 reverse the wire on the door 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.810
 closed and you do not want to open 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:52.160
 be able to settle on the door and they 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:56.800
 here and stayed this business did not 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.800
 very nice this yarn exchange 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:06.350
 here is the driver's door and the 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.990
 wiring that come here with you can 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:15.520
 see they did this however the tide 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.520
 it is not cut 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:29.980
 this other was my father in the 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:34.910
 customs of his cars with latch 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:38.090
 original factory where the door of the 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.680
 ride does not trigger the driver's door 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.290
 in the attempt he took the concessionaire 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.110
 by those who withdraw this option they do not 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.300
 they knew how and cut off the three children 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.660
 right 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:53.540
 they cut off the three children that 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:58.610
 red here that it was for them to remove 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:01.310
 holy and in the guessing game elimination 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:06.020
 they cut the three and made a 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:09.140
 test is a point of only here that was the 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:12.440
 I had given and decided to do this 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.150
 tutorial for you all right then what 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.650
 happens 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.650
 the setting my father chose 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.440
 working here by the driver's door 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:34.450
 If I come to open the door of the 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.450
 ride 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:43.250
 the engine does not work on my door 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:49.100
 driver 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:51.520
 only in my case I prefer the two or 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.520
 So come back just by giving this thread here. 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.520
 right 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:01.000
 so come on the secret is the following to 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.000
 wiring splicing 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:17.560
 sure and come back only giving at least 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.830
 procedure to do this with a 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:29.320
 iron a cut in the part of 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:31.560
 under the right wire and the top one 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.290
 step to solder 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:39.040
 looks 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:42.670
 something that is very simple and that avoids 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.530
 many problems in case there they staff 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:51.780
 female concessionaire only 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:55.500
 the amendment showing here to you what 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:06:03.120
 it's something that really happens a lot 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:03.120
 in the world of picks 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:10.560
 It's very common for you to see people do 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:12.420
 this kind of service and do not go under 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:18.220
 certain people 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:20.790
 so the tip is where they exist in 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.790
 amendments 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:28.780
 and hey, it's because of that 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:33.190
 explanation but usually these 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:38.680
 is inside the vehicle door 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:50.860
 I 'm just going to find out by removing the 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:56.580
 new door liner due to the passage of the 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:59.580
 whip that often does not fit in 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.580
 cars 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:09.090
 soda do not forget to isolate're good 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.090
 quality 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:16.630
 In case you have a 300 

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:19.890
 everyone to buy because it really is a lot 

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:23.800
 Good, I 'm not making anything, not anymore. 

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:25.420
 really they deserve this prestige 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:31.150
 because they make a material of 

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:32.020
 personal touch quality then strong 

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:35.590
 hug 

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:38.290
 this tip, do not forget to help out there 

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:42.630
 giving life in the video 

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:42.630
 the only question is post
