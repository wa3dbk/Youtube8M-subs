00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.000
 really worth it so hide his triple 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.950

 idf twice before being awarded 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.540
 in 2013 by a jury obviously 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.640
 conquered by his original approach to 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.440
 platform game we embody a gamer 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.699
 struggling with his video game that has to 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.830
 move your hero using the keyboard 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.480
 but also take advantage of 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.059
 objects within reach to help his avatar 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.769
 for example by lighting a lighter close 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.089
 of the screen to light the way or in 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:02.949
 hiding the hero's progress to 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.509
 using the smoke of a cigarette or in 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.670
 playing with the decor thanks to a magnet 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:08.830
 nothing really realistic but an owl 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.149
 little slightly meta concept that gets 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.710

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:13.360
 waiting to be able to put the nose 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.140
 out or before moving on to the next 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.140
 game of this selection 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.250
 and while some india and seines 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.200
 to restore peace to the world with 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.850
 their other hippies game dream of 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.960
 go back to the fundamentals of video that 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.360
 his quake and doom 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.880
 this is the case of 30 films and design with 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.710
 their prototype baptized butcher sort of 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.320
 pixelized love letter to the simulator of 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.390
 murder from the early 90's levels to 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.520
 big stages guns that make you tremble 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.840
 the screen and ireland of tripailles the 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.400
 title embarks all we could 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.710
 hope for a game that flood the screen 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.750
 of hemoglobin sound screen titles in 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.160
 bonus a metal soundtrack 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.350
 industrial perfectly in the tone 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.390
 embellished here and there by the complaints 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.620
 throbbing cripples that are left 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.230
 to burst into their pool of blood 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.430
 the antipodes of king arthur gold 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.590
 developed by the same team 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.850
 butcher is a party a party that turns 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.850
 badly but a party anyway 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.100
 not young but more current than 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.110
 never the excellent nay tronic rock is 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.540
 a clever mx2 car race and 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.440
 survival in die and retry driving a 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.910
 futuristic racing car 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.950
 the player to sneak between the 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.080
 obstacles measure his turbo avoiding the 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.670
 overheating and chaining the figures for 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.209
 cool his engine to the next 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.520
 checkpoint 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.110
 to do this we have a touch of 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.160
 lateral reactor jump that 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.110
 allow the most rotations 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.050
 crack the universe but also and especially 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.640
 of a lose-it retractable then certainly 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.709
 it allows the game to fart class 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.330
 obviously but not that it's also 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.550
 thanks to this addition that the creator gets 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.410
 multiply the routes bis play 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.850
 with the verticality of the ground and 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.100
 propose a varied challenge mode and 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.790
 bourrin note that two years after its implementation 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.380
 in circulation 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.120
 these leaders online terminals live 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.170
 still they wait that saw score this 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.850
 which should allow you to 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.370
 prepare properly for the release of 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.020
 distance its commercial suite available 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.620
 via when the steam accesses since everything 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.620
 just a week 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.100
 take the binding of isaac remove the 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.870
 religion tumors fluids 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.970
 corporal and procedural generation 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.740
 yes I know that's a lot but 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.480
 now add a little msx rendering to 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.490
 the old pretty colors a few 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.920
 good feelings and that's the job 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.330
 princess remady it's the game developed 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.130
 in four days by some of the 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.500
 developers behind the friendly itl 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.570
 sweet at the ebola game jam 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.310
 the team imagined a mini RPG in 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.050
 which a young healer walks around 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.060
 city ​​in town to heal the inhabitants 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.800
 of their city a word every phase of 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.540
 healing scares like a piece of isaac 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.310
 or the shooting is automatic and where the 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.320
 medial missiles replace the 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.330
 tears with a bestiary that evolve to 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.459
 as the adventure and one or 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.020
 two special abilities to use nothing 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.520
 of good sorcerer yet the sauce takes 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.500
 the levels follow each other without 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.209
 look like and ended up paying the game 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:08.050
 swaying on his chair at the sound of 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:10.090
 his crypt a cute game jam always 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.070
 with one of the nationals of the 31st 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.320
 the stop doom dedicated to the game that 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.350
 stand on a simple screen in orione 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.239
 in this case it's a cockpit in 48 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.160
 hours said gogo bernard imagined a 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.300
 short adventure that places the player in 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.460
 only master aboard a shuttle 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.050
 Space takeoff illusion 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.060
 works through the proper use 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.040
 sound and the profusion of buttons 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.570
 engine control firing 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.940
 separation of the different modules 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.380
 you have to spot and hurry when the tower 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.120
 of control the required 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.530
 higher in the atmosphere the player 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.419
 will have to maintain the horizon of the device 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.860
 on the keyboard and continue his routine of 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.560
 press button avoiding to leave 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.880
 distract and at the end of the gold trajectory 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.910
 nothing offer you the land seen from 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.910
 sky 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.950
 is back on the floor of the cows 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.270
 it's an opportunity to weave a strand 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.080
 of social bond with thunderdome 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.210
 wrestling 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.400
 so yes it's a title completely 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.650
 happy and yes it is indeed a 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.510
 worst thumb battle simulator 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.820
 still his two plays on a single pad 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.980
 each his branch his stick and his 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.780
 trigger in addition to the feigned classics 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.520
 of phalanges the drug mini-game 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.200
 holder embeds some inspired ideas 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.910
 of the fighting game like for example the 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.770
 ability to fill an ultra bard 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.210
 which will allow for great corner 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.520
 adversaries under an avalanche of effects 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.320
 sound and light completely con and 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.250
 height of realism the pulls of 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.600
 two hands on the controller you 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.820
 will guarantee cramps similar to 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.280
 that of a real war of thumb too 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.170
 con that funny thunder of death s line 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.700
 consumes in small keys a part 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.320
 from time to time to settle a 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.440
 dispute or designated who does the 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.440
 washing up 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.720
 onyx break is not quite young but we 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.790
 stamp it a little when they deserve 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.620
 to rot your week end on it control 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.910
 a miniaturized physicist is launched to 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.200
 all legs in an accelerator 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.970
 particles to incredible 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.800
 discoveries then none of this has 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.000
 the least scientific base but that 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.280
 allows developers to deliver a 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.750
 young meals in the spotlight a little crazy at the 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.460
 immediate handling without 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.530
 sacrifice the least ounce of challenge 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.720
 thereafter we jump from plan to plan 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.410
 we identify booster plates 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.510
 ephemeral forms 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.980
 the route bonzes are embossed 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.840
 stack before reaching the next level 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.390
 and we start again until we understand 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.890
 assembly logic of all this boxon the 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.690
 music goes perfectly with the run 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:24.190
 to infinity with electro themes 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.260
 minimalist but no less effective 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.940
 we 'll finish by warning what the six 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.250
 benzene levels x will leave on their 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.390
 hungry for the existence of a remake sold 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.660
 on steam with 12 levels 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.660
 additional 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.930
 to finish let's give ourselves a second 

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:45.540
 crochet to the last ouzoum 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.460
 stop with the water breaker in a 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.750
 city ​​in aerial view fixes a thug 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.340
 of orange interfere with bank robberies 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.870
 escaping the police 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.340
 there is a little pac-man in there 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.100
 especially at the camera angle 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.750
 adopted and the management of enemies but 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.610
 we especially note the clear homage to gta 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.080
 with a fluctuation of Monday's 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.030
 research and the possibility of being 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.830
 forget about it by swapping his vehicle for 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.970
 continue incognito a maneuver 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.770
 more complex than there 

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:09.660
 appears the prosecutors justifying 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.040
 unia rue denon malines for a project 

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.020
 sets up in just two days 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.790
 pity the robber does not propose 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.110
 finally little playing time in 

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:18.389
 its gameplay could engulf
