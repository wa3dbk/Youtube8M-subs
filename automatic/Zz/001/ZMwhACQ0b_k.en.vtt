00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
all kinds of different doodles so let's

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.780 
all kinds of different doodles so let's
try<00:02:31.560> up<00:02:31.680> something<00:02:31.890> different<00:02:32.160> now<00:02:32.250> this<00:02:32.640> is

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
try up something different now this is

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.030 
try up something different now this is
the<00:02:32.820> easiest<00:02:33.270> doodle<00:02:33.600> on<00:02:33.780> earth<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.770> is

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
the easiest doodle on earth and it is

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.220 
the easiest doodle on earth and it is
bump<00:02:35.700> bump<00:02:35.760> bump<00:02:36.240> bump<00:02:36.420> bump<00:02:36.600> bump<00:02:36.780> bump<00:02:36.990> I

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
bump bump bump bump bump bump bump I

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.530 
bump bump bump bump bump bump bump I
think<00:02:37.560> that's<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.860> official<00:02:38.250> name<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:39.030> all

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
think that's the official name of it all

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.600 
think that's the official name of it all
it<00:02:39.870> is<00:02:40.050> is<00:02:40.320> a<00:02:40.380> scratch<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.130> now<00:02:41.250> that<00:02:41.430> doesn't

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
it is is a scratch and now that doesn't

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.480 
it is is a scratch and now that doesn't
look<00:02:41.910> like<00:02:41.970> anything<00:02:42.570> by<00:02:42.720> itself<00:02:42.930> but<00:02:43.770> when

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
look like anything by itself but when

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.340 
look like anything by itself but when
you<00:02:44.580> start<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.210> get<00:02:45.360> a<00:02:45.420> bunch<00:02:45.900> of<00:02:46.140> them

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
you start to get a bunch of them

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.670 
you start to get a bunch of them
together<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:47.580> starts<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:48.720> create<00:02:49.050> a<00:02:49.200> really

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
together it starts to create a really

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.830 
together it starts to create a really
cool<00:02:50.040> pattern<00:02:50.640> so<00:02:50.910> I'm<00:02:51.060> just<00:02:51.300> going<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.510> keep

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
cool pattern so I'm just going to keep

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.830 
cool pattern so I'm just going to keep
going<00:02:51.900> with<00:02:52.560> all<00:02:53.100> of<00:02:53.340> my<00:02:53.520> colors<00:02:53.850> mixing<00:02:54.660> them

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
going with all of my colors mixing them

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.660 
going with all of my colors mixing them
up<00:02:55.020> it's<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.560> great<00:02:55.770> way<00:02:55.980> it's<00:02:56.220> kind<00:02:56.400> of<00:02:56.490> like

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
up it's a great way it's kind of like

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.570 
up it's a great way it's kind of like
what<00:02:56.790> i<00:02:56.880> call<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.300> fill<00:02:57.780> doodle<00:02:58.650> sometimes<00:02:59.430> you

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
what i call a fill doodle sometimes you

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.060 
what i call a fill doodle sometimes you
need<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.850> doodle<00:03:00.270> that<00:03:00.420> just<00:03:00.750> fills<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.680> space

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
need a doodle that just fills the space

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.120 
need a doodle that just fills the space
so<00:03:02.940> it's<00:03:03.210> a<00:03:03.330> great<00:03:03.570> little<00:03:03.780> fill<00:03:04.320> doodle<00:03:04.890> and

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
so it's a great little fill doodle and

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.770 
so it's a great little fill doodle and
you<00:03:05.310> can<00:03:05.460> make<00:03:05.670> them<00:03:05.880> of<00:03:06.060> course<00:03:06.360> have

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
you can make them of course have

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.920 
you can make them of course have
different<00:03:07.440> rhythms<00:03:08.100> you<00:03:08.850> can<00:03:09.090> arrange<00:03:09.600> them

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
different rhythms you can arrange them

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.540 
different rhythms you can arrange them
in<00:03:10.200> different<00:03:10.500> way<00:03:10.800> so<00:03:10.860> they<00:03:11.100> go<00:03:11.280> in<00:03:11.400> different

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
in different way so they go in different

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.780 
in different way so they go in different
angles<00:03:12.330> you<00:03:13.320> can<00:03:13.350> make<00:03:13.650> them<00:03:13.800> short<00:03:14.190> or<00:03:14.490> long

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
angles you can make them short or long

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.570 
angles you can make them short or long
curve<00:03:15.540> them<00:03:15.900> into<00:03:16.530> different<00:03:16.860> shapes<00:03:16.920> here

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
curve them into different shapes here

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.449 
curve them into different shapes here
you<00:03:17.700> go<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.450> have<00:03:19.170> them<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:19.950> know<00:03:20.070> change

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
you go and have them you know change

simply<00:04:59.250> start<00:04:59.789> folding<00:05:00.199> both<00:05:01.199> ways<00:05:01.590> so<00:05:01.979> it

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
simply start folding both ways so it

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.790 
simply start folding both ways so it
goes<00:05:02.400> one<00:05:02.669> way<00:05:02.849> it<00:05:03.270> goes<00:05:03.449> the<00:05:03.599> other<00:05:03.630> way<00:05:04.050> it

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
goes one way it goes the other way it

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.610 
goes one way it goes the other way it
can<00:05:04.979> go<00:05:05.009> the<00:05:05.130> same<00:05:05.460> way<00:05:05.490> multiple<00:05:06.150> times<00:05:06.620> I'm

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
can go the same way multiple times I'm

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.469 
can go the same way multiple times I'm
just<00:05:07.800> having<00:05:08.009> a<00:05:08.070> good<00:05:08.280> time<00:05:08.580> playing<00:05:09.060> around

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
just having a good time playing around

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:11.689 
just having a good time playing around
and<00:05:09.780> I'm<00:05:10.199> going<00:05:10.349> to<00:05:10.380> do<00:05:10.470> the<00:05:10.590> same<00:05:10.889> thing<00:05:11.310> to

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
and I'm going to do the same thing to

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.810 
and I'm going to do the same thing to
this<00:05:11.789> next<00:05:12.180> strip<00:05:12.720> the<00:05:13.320> reason<00:05:13.740> I<00:05:13.919> need<00:05:13.979> to<00:05:14.160> is

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
this next strip the reason I need to is

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.659 
this next strip the reason I need to is
because<00:05:15.270> one<00:05:15.780> is<00:05:15.990> not<00:05:16.229> long<00:05:16.740> enough<00:05:16.770> for<00:05:17.520> what

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
because one is not long enough for what

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:20.029 
because one is not long enough for what
I<00:05:17.699> have<00:05:18.030> planned<00:05:18.539> and<00:05:18.990> what<00:05:19.590> I<00:05:19.620> do<00:05:19.740> now<00:05:20.009> to

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
I have planned and what I do now to

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:22.909 
I have planned and what I do now to
connect<00:05:20.759> them<00:05:21.090> is<00:05:21.389> I<00:05:21.930> create<00:05:22.259> a<00:05:22.289> little<00:05:22.560> fold

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
connect them is I create a little fold

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.939 
connect them is I create a little fold
at<00:05:23.220> the<00:05:23.280> end<00:05:23.669> just<00:05:24.030> fold<00:05:24.449> that<00:05:24.570> over<00:05:24.630> I<00:05:25.139> take

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:25.949 
at the end just fold that over I take

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:29.120 
at the end just fold that over I take
some<00:05:26.160> adhesive<00:05:27.110> apply<00:05:28.110> it<00:05:28.169> right<00:05:28.830> on<00:05:29.099> that

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
some adhesive apply it right on that

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.180 
some adhesive apply it right on that
little<00:05:29.520> strip<00:05:30.060> there<00:05:30.659> and<00:05:30.870> then<00:05:31.800> I'm<00:05:32.010> going<00:05:32.130> to

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
little strip there and then I'm going to

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.310 
little strip there and then I'm going to
go<00:05:32.400> ahead<00:05:32.430> and<00:05:32.760> attach<00:05:33.479> it<00:05:33.510> together<00:05:33.960> and<00:05:34.199> it

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
go ahead and attach it together and it

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.520 
go ahead and attach it together and it
ends<00:05:34.680> up<00:05:34.740> looking<00:05:34.770> just<00:05:35.099> like<00:05:35.340> another<00:05:35.789> fold

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
ends up looking just like another fold

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.980 
ends up looking just like another fold
