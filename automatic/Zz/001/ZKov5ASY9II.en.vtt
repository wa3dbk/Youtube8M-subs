Pat<00:02:59.299> it<00:02:59.330> in<00:02:59.569> there<00:02:59.980> and<00:03:01.540> a<00:03:02.540> lot<00:03:02.690> of<00:03:02.750> times<00:03:02.989> I

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
Pat it in there and a lot of times I

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.930 
Pat it in there and a lot of times I
used<00:03:03.319> a<00:03:03.470> little<00:03:03.739> bit<00:03:03.860> at<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.459> top<00:03:04.549> of<00:03:04.730> my<00:03:04.910> eye

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.020 
used a little bit at the top of my eye
too<00:03:05.440> because<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:06.590> skin<00:03:06.799> around<00:03:06.890> your<00:03:07.069> eye<00:03:07.190> is

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
too because the skin around your eye is

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.300 
too because the skin around your eye is
thinner<00:03:08.390> than<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.690> rest<00:03:08.870> of<00:03:08.989> your<00:03:09.080> face<00:03:09.380> so<00:03:09.709> I

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
thinner than the rest of your face so I

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.410 
thinner than the rest of your face so I
had<00:03:10.430> to<00:03:10.459> cover<00:03:10.700> it<00:03:10.910> completely<00:03:12.819> do<00:03:13.819> this<00:03:14.180> like

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
had to cover it completely do this like

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.550 
had to cover it completely do this like
that<00:03:16.239> now<00:03:17.239> also<00:03:17.480> if<00:03:17.810> you<00:03:17.930> have<00:03:18.110> really<00:03:18.380> oily

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
that now also if you have really oily

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.530 
that now also if you have really oily
skin<00:03:19.069> I<00:03:19.250> would<00:03:19.400> recommend<00:03:19.640> using<00:03:19.880> a<00:03:20.000> toner<00:03:20.239> I

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
skin I would recommend using a toner I

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.599 
skin I would recommend using a toner I
can't<00:03:21.140> use<00:03:21.410> a<00:03:21.440> toner<00:03:21.739> because<00:03:22.190> it<00:03:22.280> drives<00:03:22.430> my

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
can't use a toner because it drives my

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:25.569 
can't use a toner because it drives my
skin<00:03:22.910> out<00:03:23.090> and<00:03:23.390> oh<00:03:23.900> it<00:03:24.590> makes<00:03:24.739> it<00:03:24.920> flaky<00:03:25.340> and

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
just yucky generally so it cleansers

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.770 
just yucky generally so it cleansers
enough<00:03:27.650> for<00:03:27.859> me<00:03:27.980> but<00:03:28.790> if<00:03:28.970> you<00:03:29.000> do<00:03:29.180> oily<00:03:29.480> skin<00:03:29.720> i
