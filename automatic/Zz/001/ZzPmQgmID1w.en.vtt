00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
for their little brother so it's really

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.400 
for their little brother so it's really
a<00:02:24.450> question<00:02:24.690> of<00:02:24.900> who<00:02:25.020> are<00:02:25.080> they<00:02:25.170> going<00:02:25.349> to

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
a question of who are they going to

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.890 
a question of who are they going to
protect<00:02:25.740> and<00:02:26.069> right<00:02:26.910> now<00:02:27.060> I<00:02:27.120> feel<00:02:27.330> like<00:02:27.390> you

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
protect and right now I feel like you

protect and right now I feel like you
know<00:02:27.930> next<00:02:28.410> chapter<00:02:28.770> they're<00:02:29.160> probably<00:02:29.580> going

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
know next chapter they're probably going

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.820 
know next chapter they're probably going
to<00:02:30.090> protect<00:02:30.360> their<00:02:30.510> brothers<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:31.260> know<00:02:31.290> over

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
to protect their brothers you know over

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.920 
to protect their brothers you know over
each<00:02:31.950> other<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.520> it<00:02:32.940> also<00:02:33.060> makes<00:02:33.209> sense<00:02:33.690> in

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
each other and it also makes sense in

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.160 
each other and it also makes sense in
that<00:02:34.410> way<00:02:34.680> because<00:02:35.180> later<00:02:36.180> they<00:02:36.510> become<00:02:36.900> the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
that way because later they become the

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.339 
that way because later they become the
leaders<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:37.530> their<00:02:38.099> respective<00:02:38.610> clans<00:02:38.910> and

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
leaders of their respective clans and

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.100 
leaders of their respective clans and
they're<00:02:40.349> not<00:02:40.500> traitors<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:41.400> can't<00:02:41.580> become<00:02:41.849> a

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
they're not traitors you can't become a

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.390 
they're not traitors you can't become a
leader<00:02:43.110> of<00:02:43.200> your<00:02:43.410> clan<00:02:43.709> of<00:02:43.860> you're<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.040> traitor

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
leader of your clan of you're a traitor

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.170 
leader of your clan of you're a traitor
so<00:02:45.239> clearly<00:02:45.870> in<00:02:46.410> this<00:02:46.980> battle<00:02:47.610> that<00:02:47.790> happens

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
so clearly in this battle that happens

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.479 
so clearly in this battle that happens
next<00:02:48.420> chapter<00:02:48.989> they<00:02:49.349> must<00:02:49.590> be<00:02:49.680> siding<00:02:50.099> with

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
their clients or else that wouldn't be

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.770 
their clients or else that wouldn't be
able<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.240> happen<00:02:54.690> so<00:02:55.170> something<00:02:55.560> has

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
able to happen so something has

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.260 
able to happen so something has
have<00:02:55.930> it<00:02:56.080> in<00:02:56.200> this<00:02:56.380> fight<00:02:56.620> that<00:02:57.040> cause<00:02:57.670> what

causes a rift between them is sort of

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.360 
causes a rift between them is sort of
makes<00:03:00.670> them<00:03:01.470> well<00:03:02.470> I<00:03:02.500> won't<00:03:02.830> say<00:03:03.010> make<00:03:03.190> some

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.280 
makes them well I won't say make some
enemies<00:03:03.520> because<00:03:04.390> I<00:03:04.480> think<00:03:04.660> they<00:03:04.780> might<00:03:04.959> still

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
enemies because I think they might still

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.590 
enemies because I think they might still
be<00:03:05.530> like<00:03:05.740> secret<00:03:06.340> friends<00:03:07.060> or<00:03:07.180> maybe<00:03:07.270> like

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
be like secret friends or maybe like

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.050 
be like secret friends or maybe like
okay<00:03:08.470> with<00:03:08.650> each<00:03:08.800> other<00:03:08.950> but<00:03:09.100> it's<00:03:09.910> gonna

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
okay with each other but it's gonna

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.420 
okay with each other but it's gonna
cause<00:03:10.750> them<00:03:11.020> to<00:03:11.230> at<00:03:11.290> least<00:03:11.440> act<00:03:11.709> like<00:03:12.040> rivals

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
cause them to at least act like rivals

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.370 
cause them to at least act like rivals
towards<00:03:12.970> each<00:03:13.060> other<00:03:13.209> I<00:03:13.600> feel<00:03:14.050> like<00:03:14.170> that's

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
towards each other I feel like that's

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.500 
towards each other I feel like that's
probably<00:03:14.800> going<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.010> be<00:03:15.330> protecting<00:03:16.330> their

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510

probably going to be protecting their
brothers<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:19.500> yeah<00:03:20.500> that's<00:03:20.770> basically<00:03:20.890> all<00:03:21.280> I

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400

sweet<00:03:27.220> if<00:03:27.340> they<00:03:27.489> protect<00:03:27.790> each<00:03:27.850> other<00:03:28.000> it<00:03:28.180> can

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
sweet if they protect each other it can

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.410 
sweet if they protect each other it can
be<00:03:28.480> pretty<00:03:28.660> cool<00:03:28.920> but<00:03:29.920> right<00:03:30.280> now<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:31.120> way<00:03:31.239> it

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
be pretty cool but right now the way it

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.050 
be pretty cool but right now the way it
looks<00:03:31.690> they're<00:03:31.989> probably<00:03:32.230> gonna<00:03:32.910> you<00:03:33.910> know

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060

like<00:03:37.989> you<00:03:38.320> know<00:03:38.350> I'm<00:03:38.560> fighting<00:03:38.890> with<00:03:38.920> my

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
like you know I'm fighting with my

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.190 
like you know I'm fighting with my
family<00:03:39.310> against<00:03:39.820> you<00:03:40.030> which<00:03:40.870> is<00:03:40.900> going<00:03:41.140> to

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
family against you which is going to

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.590 
family against you which is going to
make<00:03:41.290> more<00:03:41.650> sense<00:03:41.950> when<00:03:42.459> they<00:03:42.610> become<00:03:42.970> you

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
make more sense when they become you

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.660 
make more sense when they become you
know<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:44.410> leaders<00:03:44.739> of<00:03:44.769> their<00:03:45.160> respective

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
clans and whatnot and then in the future

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.030 
clans and whatnot and then in the future
it'll<00:03:48.670> probably<00:03:48.940> you<00:03:49.090> know<00:03:49.150> be<00:03:49.420> more<00:03:49.720> eager<00:03:50.530> to

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
it'll probably you know be more eager to

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.330 
it'll probably you know be more eager to
you<00:03:51.069> know<00:03:51.250> make<00:03:52.030> peace<00:03:52.360> and<00:03:52.780> you<00:03:52.900> know<00:03:53.340> trees

I<00:04:04.140> don't<00:04:05.140> think<00:04:05.470> so<00:04:06.190> maybe<00:04:06.940> I<00:04:07.530> mean<00:04:08.530> I<00:04:08.709> don't

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
I don't think so maybe I mean I don't

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.020 
I don't think so maybe I mean I don't
really<00:04:08.920> know<00:04:09.310> that's<00:04:09.579> something<00:04:09.670> that<00:04:09.850> you

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
really know that's something that you

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.810 
really know that's something that you
can't<00:04:10.209> really<00:04:10.390> call<00:04:10.630> but<00:04:11.590> I<00:04:11.620> mean<00:04:11.890> it<00:04:12.310> would<00:04:12.730> be

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
can't really call but I mean it would be

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.160 
can't really call but I mean it would be
pretty<00:04:12.970> interesting<00:04:13.450> if<00:04:13.540> that<00:04:13.690> happened<00:04:14.079> of

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
pretty interesting if that happened of

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.409 
pretty interesting if that happened of
course<00:04:14.200> but<00:04:15.010> I<00:04:15.370> don't<00:04:15.790> think<00:04:16.000> that<00:04:16.120> that<00:04:16.209> would

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
course but I don't think that that would

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.370 
course but I don't think that that would
happen<00:04:16.479> though<00:04:17.250> so<00:04:18.900> yeah<00:04:19.900> that's<00:04:20.169> all<00:04:20.320> I
