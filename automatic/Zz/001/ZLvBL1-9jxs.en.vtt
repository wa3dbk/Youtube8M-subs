 list of settings of this tool 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:59.189
 the display mode is similar to the fact that 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.920
 we have already seen the menu view bookmark and view 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.820
 I will use the list because the list

 selection of new selection every time 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.319
 using the tool will 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:44.139
 create a new selection and the old 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.879

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:49.090
 allotment when working in graphic 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:51.579
 editors i use exactly this mode 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.560
 if you hold down the alt button it 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:56.079
 switches to subtract from

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:07.030
 selection types are normal and selection 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.209
 the most ordinary selection 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.500
 like any other editor 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.170
 diminishing secretion creates

 Selection of adjacent lines principle 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.299
 The work is well shown in the pictures from 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.510
 manual selecting internal area 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:25.090
 selects the zone of the inner shape selection 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.489
 the forum selects only the whole form 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.220
 ignores everything inside and out 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:33.040
 highlighting does the same thing 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.129
 and the previous type but you can choose parts 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.230
 the forms of the area of reference is what 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:42.069
 your instrument will respond 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:45.280

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.500

 vector center lines available 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.870

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:55.150
 slot very convenient parameter allows 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.629
 ignore small spaces in the feed 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.849
 we all have been looking for this damn 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:03.489
 missing pixel expansion zone and 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:05.560
 lowers automatic analogue of these

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.789
 from the center you can also just hold

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:23.500

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.280
 hold shift forgive after choosing 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.280
 size 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.000
 rotate the selection by a degree by ellipse and 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.540
 lasso highlighting the same settings 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.840
 polygonal lasso 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.800
 has one new operation fix on 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.800
 certain degree
