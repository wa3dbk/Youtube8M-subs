hump and the bactrian have two humps I'm
an<00:01:40.640> easy<00:01:40.880> way<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:41.119> remember<00:01:41.210> that<00:01:41.630> is<00:01:41.810> the

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
an easy way to remember that is the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.200 
an easy way to remember that is the
letter<00:01:42.289> D<00:01:42.560> has<00:01:42.830> one<00:01:43.340> hump<00:01:43.580> in<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:43.820> letter<00:01:44.000> B

the hump is used for water storage but

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.430 
the hump is used for water storage but
actually<00:01:52.550> the<00:01:52.640> hump<00:01:52.850> is<00:01:53.030> a<00:01:53.060> fat<00:01:53.420> storage<00:01:53.899> so

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
actually the hump is a fat storage so

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.200 
actually the hump is a fat storage so
they<00:01:54.470> store<00:01:54.979> fat<00:01:55.310> reserves<00:01:55.490> and<00:01:55.940> they<00:01:56.000> just

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
they store fat reserves and they just

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.059 
they store fat reserves and they just
kind<00:01:56.330> of<00:01:56.450> bulk<00:01:56.690> up<00:01:56.869> for<00:01:57.050> extra<00:01:57.259> long<00:01:57.500> trips<00:01:57.830> and

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
kind of bulk up for extra long trips and

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:00.100 
kind of bulk up for extra long trips and
that<00:01:58.160> have<00:01:58.759> a<00:01:58.789> reserve<00:01:59.420> of<00:01:59.479> calories

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
that have a reserve of calories

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.630 
that have a reserve of calories
basically<00:02:00.590> in<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.890> hump<00:02:01.100> so<00:02:01.280> it<00:02:01.369> is<00:02:01.460> not<00:02:01.580> a

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
basically in the hump so it is not a

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.480 
basically in the hump so it is not a
water<00:02:01.970> storage<00:02:02.360> unit<00:02:02.890> what<00:02:03.890> will<00:02:04.069> visitors

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
water storage unit what will visitors

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.889 
water storage unit what will visitors
see<00:02:04.670> when<00:02:04.819> they<00:02:04.940> come<00:02:05.090> over<00:02:05.179> to<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.539> exhibit

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
see when they come over to the exhibit

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.710 
see when they come over to the exhibit
to<00:02:06.229> see<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.470> camel<00:02:06.830> most<00:02:07.789> days<00:02:08.060> they<00:02:08.330> will<00:02:08.450> see

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
to see the camel most days they will see

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.480 
to see the camel most days they will see
all<00:02:08.960> four<00:02:09.229> of<00:02:09.259> our<00:02:09.410> camels<00:02:09.830> out<00:02:09.950> on<00:02:10.069> exhibit

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
all four of our camels out on exhibit

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.610 
all four of our camels out on exhibit
will<00:02:11.060> have<00:02:11.180> two<00:02:11.360> adults<00:02:11.630> and<00:02:11.960> the<00:02:12.140> two<00:02:12.290> younger

only have two of the camels out I'm just

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.870 
only have two of the camels out I'm just
moving<00:02:18.230> animals<00:02:18.709> around<00:02:18.860> but<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.700> younger

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
moving animals around but the younger

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.840 
moving animals around but the younger
girls<00:02:20.209> explore<00:02:21.020> the<00:02:21.170> entire<00:02:21.290> exhibit<00:02:21.920> so<00:02:22.250> when

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
girls explore the entire exhibit so when

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.130 
girls explore the entire exhibit so when
you<00:02:22.940> come<00:02:23.090> up<00:02:23.209> to<00:02:23.240> to<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:23.810> front<00:02:24.020> of<00:02:24.080> the

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
you come up to to the front of the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.480 
you come up to to the front of the
exhibit<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:24.530> might<00:02:24.680> have<00:02:24.830> to<00:02:24.950> look<00:02:25.100> hard<00:02:25.310> to

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
exhibit you might have to look hard to

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.160 
exhibit you might have to look hard to
see<00:02:25.670> where<00:02:25.910> they<00:02:26.060> happen<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:26.450> be<00:02:26.569> that<00:02:26.840> day<00:02:27.050> at

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
see where they happen to be that day at

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.570 
see where they happen to be that day at
that<00:02:27.350> time<00:02:27.590> because<00:02:27.830> they<00:02:27.980> definitely<00:02:28.310> are

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
that time because they definitely are

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.490 
that time because they definitely are
exploring<00:02:29.330> all<00:02:29.540> of<00:02:29.569> the<00:02:29.780> new<00:02:29.930> space<00:02:30.170> they<00:02:30.350> have

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
exploring all of the new space they have

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.130 
exploring all of the new space they have
available<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:31.010> them
