00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
a knob of this stuff in the freezer and

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.469 
a knob of this stuff in the freezer and
then<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:28.979> just<00:01:29.159> grate<00:01:29.430> however<00:01:29.850> much<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.210> need

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
and throw it back into the freezer after

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.249 
and throw it back into the freezer after
I'm<00:01:32.310> done<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.240> reason<00:01:33.479> they<00:01:33.570> try<00:01:33.930> keeping

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
I'm done and the reason they try keeping

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.679 
I'm done and the reason they try keeping
it<00:01:34.380> frozen<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.979> because<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.640> find<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.299> can't

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
it frozen is because I find that I can't

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.260 
it frozen is because I find that I can't
use<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.229> fast<00:01:37.470> enough<00:01:37.860> before<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.640> goes<00:01:38.729> bad<00:01:38.970> in

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
use it fast enough before it goes bad in

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.630 
use it fast enough before it goes bad in
the<00:01:39.360> fridge<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.650> way<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.220> flavor<00:01:41.460> is

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
the fridge so this way the flavor is

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.550 
the fridge so this way the flavor is
still<00:01:41.909> really<00:01:42.270> potent<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.020> lasts<00:01:43.350> for<00:01:43.530> a

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
still really potent and it lasts for a

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.190 
still really potent and it lasts for a
really<00:01:43.740> long<00:01:43.920> time<00:01:44.840> so<00:01:45.840> we're<00:01:45.960> just<00:01:45.990> gonna
