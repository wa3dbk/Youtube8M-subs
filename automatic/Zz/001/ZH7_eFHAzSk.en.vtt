00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 without wanting to take the credit of anyone until 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.779
 because that's not the goal we're going to 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.719
 combine to make an event for a 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.300
 public who already knows like horse 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.519
 Creole is much simpler than attracting 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.980
 people who are not from the middle 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.160
 however for some time now the hut 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.140
 rafael has taken on this commitment and 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.480
 with much competence 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.820
 a unique event where the exchange of 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.470
 experiences and all earned 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.470
 mainly the Creole horse 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.030
 the land or the guests arrive from all over the 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.030

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:46.350
 people who come to compete total is the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.300
 in rural areas sympathizes with the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.879
 simply here to honor 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.530
 a lemanski family event one of the 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.270
 the most traditional of the state of parana is 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.770
 so rich that our universe has so much 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.780
 positive thing to show that I do 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.609
 to mix just bring 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.379
 new people to see how rich this is 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.450
 our world and how we can 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.619
 multiply this energy 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.619
 dunga if I do not want 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.230
 the red-black interest 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.870
 I 'm lost 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:27.190
 in fact the horse and the pretext but the 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:30.730
 that revolves around the going to the law sculptures 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.570
 of luiz gagliastri part of the 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:39.070
 sculptor joão turin gives a touch of art 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:42.850
 Refinement of the event is to make an event 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.570
 with the backdrop of this glamor they have 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.410
 That 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.960
 This whole party is fantastic, Mariano. 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.980
 Congratulations to take the family elche. 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.950
 lemanski entrance side a large 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:00.310
 LED panel on the power 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.630
 practicality of the futures and believe 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.630
 also a space of beauty 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:12.280
 It's wonderful old football ovation here 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.959
 It's between women are enjoying super 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.720
 enjoying right who does not like the 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.489
 environment like this here in the middle of 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.660
 beautiful and glamorous people and still 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.660
 improving the visual 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:35.190
 he keeps using pieces like that to us 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.310
 feels a real work of art and the 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:42.180
 Nanda managed to make this subtle blend 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:45.540
 and delicate it is to bring the sculpture to 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.599
 the female jewelry is also exactly 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.540
 this way I found to crown the 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:54.480
 women for their deeds is a 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.250
 accessory you can have a party 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.040
 cycle to wear a beautiful dress 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.459
 Wonderful or you could be in jeans 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.560
 and I do not think he's very 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.350
 versatile and what is interesting to us 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.549
 highlight in this work of nanda is that 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:16.049
 he is politically correct in terms 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:19.950
 ecological she reuses cans 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:22.799
 anyway what you can for the trash actually 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.620
 become art but you know exactly what I think 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:28.260
 the art is there you transform something 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.750
 that was rubbish in luxury 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.239
 So we turn the cans of 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.370
 drink is soda 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.120
 they are shaped in the fire is a whole 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.120
 transmutation 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.130
 interrupts the gentlemen to 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.460
 talk with this illustrious presence here 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.100
 excuse is not that is quiet 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:04:00.000
 I want to know if the subject is 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.070
 football the golden brake one of two 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.560
 mixed with this morning on horseback 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.580
 Creole horse Creole football the people 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.460
 is not talking 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.590
 I made a special request send today is 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.810
 a day of kinects so no work 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.270
 It's true, it 's a different environment than 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.519
 people want to take advantage of 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:26.610
 simplicity and the hospitality of a 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:30.360
 atmosphere as good as it already had 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:34.110
 information that this event in action 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:37.980
 rafael is a milestone inside the horse 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:41.100
 Creole and we came here to learn 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.900
 we are starting a cabana and the 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.120
 cabanha four lines who is 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.160
 initiating you have to learn a lot 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.910
 and nothing better than learning from 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:53.210
 the police better here is an event 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.220
 great with different situations 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:59.430
 happening simultaneously requires 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.520
 hand labor in status and more than 300 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.520
 employees 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:12.030
 I wish we had the 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.030
 states of the Marian federation by state 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.230
 we feel extremely flattered of 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.930
 be able to host an event in this way but 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:22.330
 As this occurs people take 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.030
 awareness of the importance of doing 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.880
 things with responsibility and with 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.610
 like it because it is only here people 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:34.590
 who like something they love 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:38.440
 Do something and do it for love. 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.490
 where again its use around a 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.280
 passion 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.260
 the horses of the creole breed animals with 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.860
 singular features such as 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.530
 resistance to force 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.210
 and beauty 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.800
 I understood that the black horse came in 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.720
 our life to give us this 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.300
 to show the world that this 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.640
 region which is a special region and 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.740
 more than this can generate value for 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.850
 the local community that we can 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.700
 really invest in development 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:09.010
 of this region in an organized and 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.750
 power actually contribute to the 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:13.170
 development of the human being through 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.170
 Creole horse 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:19.310
 this is like a legacy because the 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.490
 people come to know the region's taste 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.020
 region then back is the way of us 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:26.300
