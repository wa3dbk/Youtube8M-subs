the board I'll scratched up and get your
wheels<00:02:02.219> all<00:02:02.460> scratched<00:02:02.759> up<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.329> there's<00:02:03.509> no

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
wheels all scratched up so there's no

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.990 
wheels all scratched up so there's no
chunks<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.079> us<00:02:04.469> taking<00:02:04.680> out<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.399> that's<00:02:05.729> a

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
chunks of us taking out so that's a

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.320 
chunks of us taking out so that's a
really<00:02:06.090> good<00:02:06.509> thing<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:07.049> yeah<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.459> but<00:02:08.879> one

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
really good thing and yeah so but one

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.420 
really good thing and yeah so but one
one<00:02:09.660> disadvantage<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:11.190> thing<00:02:11.400> is

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
one disadvantage that this thing is

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.910 
one disadvantage that this thing is
really<00:02:11.760> interview<00:02:12.090> it's<00:02:12.390> about<00:02:12.629> 10<00:02:13.349> pounds

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
really interview it's about 10 pounds

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.230 
really interview it's about 10 pounds
but<00:02:14.130> it's<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.670> know<00:02:14.700> it's<00:02:14.790> better<00:02:15.120> than

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
but it's you know it's better than

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.089 
but it's you know it's better than
carrying<00:02:15.690> around<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.959> longboard<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.920> it's<00:02:17.040> a

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
carrying around a longboard and it's a

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.589 
carrying around a longboard and it's a
lot<00:02:17.250> more<00:02:17.280> fun<00:02:17.550> that's<00:02:17.880> what<00:02:18.000> that's<00:02:18.330> what<00:02:18.390> we

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
lot more fun that's what that's what we

have like this they have a squid a
circle<00:03:03.090> kicked<00:03:03.900> out<00:03:04.170> which<00:03:04.350> makes<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:04.650> a

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
circle kicked out which makes it a

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.830 
circle kicked out which makes it a
little<00:03:04.860> bit<00:03:04.980> harder<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.280> kick<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:06.269> camp<00:03:06.540> so

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
little bit harder to kick the camp so

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.150 
little bit harder to kick the camp so
yeah<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.549> but<00:03:08.549> this<00:03:08.730> one<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.150> just<00:03:09.390> a<00:03:10.170> straight

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
yeah and but this one is just a straight

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.009 
yeah and but this one is just a straight
line<00:03:11.280> and<00:03:11.519> so<00:03:12.030> but<00:03:12.209> it<00:03:12.360> makes<00:03:12.569> it<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:12.720> lot<00:03:12.810> easier

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
line and so but it makes it a lot easier

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.039 
line and so but it makes it a lot easier
it's<00:03:13.380> a<00:03:13.560> manual<00:03:14.040> or<00:03:14.790> Ollie's<00:03:15.030> also<00:03:15.690> unique

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
it's a manual or Ollie's also unique

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.780 
it's a manual or Ollie's also unique
yeah<00:03:16.470> it's<00:03:16.650> pretty<00:03:16.769> easy<00:03:16.980> that's<00:03:17.580> what<00:03:17.760> I

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
yeah it's pretty easy that's what I

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.240 
yeah it's pretty easy that's what I
think<00:03:18.209> that<00:03:18.329> this<00:03:18.420> is<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.750> best<00:03:18.959> out<00:03:19.230> of<00:03:19.260> the

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
think that this is the best out of the

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.550 
think that this is the best out of the
three<00:03:20.280> penny<00:03:20.940> by<00:03:21.299> a<00:03:21.329> cruiser<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:22.019> you<00:03:22.500> know

three penny by a cruiser and you know
many<00:03:22.799> I<00:03:22.950> think<00:03:23.160> it<00:03:23.220> is<00:03:23.250> first<00:03:23.579> because<00:03:24.620> it's

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
many I think it is first because it's

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.300 
many I think it is first because it's
really<00:03:25.890> unique<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:26.519> it's<00:03:27.120> really<00:03:28.019> smooth

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
really unique and it's really smooth

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.080 
really unique and it's really smooth
