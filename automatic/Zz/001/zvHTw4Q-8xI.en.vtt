 How to protect the body cells from 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.360
 destruction and malignant 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.860
 transformations 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.360
 these and other gate questions 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.429
 were considered at the conference of doctors 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.269
 which was held in Vladimir in the past 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:21.650
 weekend with details of anton owls 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.130
 the disease is easier to prevent than 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.890
 cure 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.149
 under this slogan was a conference 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.460
 medical practitioners such conferences 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:30.349
 pass 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.930
 Vladimir in all regions of Russia in 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.300
 many work abroad about which doctors 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.829
 practitioners share poe experiences 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.769

 appeared in 1934 the first such 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.609
 the drug was made by Carl rain 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.280
 Bern in Europe and America bady actively 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:54.350
 apply 70s of the last century in 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.749
 Russia this unconventional treatment method 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.230
 use a little over ten years honestly 

00:00:56.749 --> 00:00:59.239
 by saying 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.989
 almost great now if you like 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.940
 the doctor is petro health and practically 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.200
 a meager amount is born and there 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.110
 applying these supplements 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.850
 we practically eliminate the growth of those 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.100
 diseases which are possible 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.410
 the spectrum can practically develop 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.420
 application of additives is incredibly wide their 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.950
 use in pulmonology cardiology

 they can be prevented 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.700
 development of malignant tumors and 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.360
 minimize slagging

 of the body 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.900
 This is especially important for pediatric medicine. 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.370
 about half in Russia 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.320
 first graders suffer from 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.480
 overwork and not due to high 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.370

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:52.530
 and we carry 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:58.010
 some very key sho stock

 coming years of positive life 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.160
 most doctors in the country are incredulous 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.140
 refer to a dietary supplement and rarely 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.370

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.690
 fakes 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.790
 which at best do no harm 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.290
 you can use only those drugs 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.560

 alarming diagnosis which is increasingly

 put St. Petersburg children recently in 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.260
 schools did research and here

 the third child does not save even 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.290
 special drugs in high doses 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.540
 children have teeth broken hair fall out

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.110
 manifestation 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.120
 much worse than what's going on inside 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.549
 hemoglobin level decreases digestion 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.980
 broken bones weakens and from this 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.700
 we are deformed that is saint petersburg 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.090
 our children are leaders 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.650
 sorry in a bad way or return by

 musculoskeletal system

 systems among different age groups 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.470
 that is, here we are leading very 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.290
 essentially that is two and a half times 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.849
 higher incidence of such indicators 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.459
 as in St. Petersburg is not in any other 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.920
 the city causes the climate is too damp 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.290
 nevsky yes minerals without the sun it 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.540
 almost none but ecology is all this 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.250
 undermines children's immunity restore 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.479
 its not just at least needed 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.780
 eat right 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.400
 nutritionists seriously fearing for health 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.710
 Petersburgers in the store told 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.150
 what to buy and what not to here 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.940
 some important tips 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.370
 bread only with bran a lot of grain 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.800
 loaves and pastries we exclude there 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.810
 vitamins only dangerous calories very 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.330
 useful cereals rice and buckwheat 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.550
 and here we cross out the millet and semolina 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.889
 from the diet of low biological value 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.740
 and be sure to vegetables carrots 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:52.250
 turnip turnouts and especially beets there are many 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.580
 of fibers 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:58.100
 Dietary fiber is the undigested part 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.990
 our diet is not digested but 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.000
 they are needed for the right times 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.220
 worked intestines for intestinal motility 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.820
 and they are absolutely necessary for 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:10.039
 the functioning of the intestinal microbiota 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.560
 microorganisms useful which 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:14.600
 synthesize vitamins before servant u p n 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.850
 but tomatoes and cucumbers 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.160
 rule there is almost no vitamins are not 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.800
 season for and bring vegetables as a rule 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.139
 from a dietitian with import in general 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.120
 complicated relationship after this statistic 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:29.539
 compared the quality of American beef 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:32.419
 and chicken for the last 40 years calcium in 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:35.740
 meat decreased by 20 percent iron 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:38.870
 35 vitamin b1 disappeared by 50 percent 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:41.570
 vitamin a per 100 similar indicators and 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:44.930
 on chicken almost 17 percent become 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:48.050
 less calcium 70 vitamin a and 30 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.450
 percent of vitamin b1 however and to ours 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.120
 meat is not a claim for vitamins 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.169
 on terms and conditions of storage 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.539
 repeatedly frozen product 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:59.539
 loses beneficial vitamins better buying 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:00.800
 fresh meat do not forget about the fish there are many 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.990
 polyunsaturated same 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.000

 the diet of dairy products 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.389
 but not fat but oils and sweets 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:16.370
 it is better to completely exclude nutritionists 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:18.949
 helped us make the right diet 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.289
 food for one day for breakfast cereal from 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:23.990
 oatmeal on milk no more 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:26.270
 one percent drinks all this juice 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:29.599
 direct spin it is the most useful 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:32.030
 for lunch chicken breast broth and fish 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:35.000
 for example with rice but for dinner well 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:38.000
 eat fresh vegetable salad fruit and 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.219
 yogurt but even if you eat right 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.870

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.159
 you should not drink them in spring and autumn 

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:52.370
