00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.639
 the x5 from bmw for martin kaufmann that 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.289
 dream car par excellence but also one 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.180
 pretty fatal affair 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:17.490
 because car thieves are just as hot on the 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.619
 I have the carriage and that 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.960
 parked at night and get out in the morning 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.640
 on Monday super annoying yes that one 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.439
 I have the real dream car 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.089
 Dirt again and the fear is 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.759
 Of course, there they will be again 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.739
 Over and with the second time dare 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.420
 is stolen 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.980
 the fear is not unjustified 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.960
 organized bands make in 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.400
 germany despite alarm systems better 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.380
 castles or more sophisticated 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.210
 immobilizer still fat booty 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.280
 last year alone 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.900
 Stolen over 20,000 cars in this country 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.180
 that never appeared again 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.000
 the classy off-road vehicle porsche cayenne 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.890
 and x5 from bmw are the absolute ones 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.450
 top riders on the hit list of the most 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.980
 Eastern European bands 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.560
 but how do professionals car thieves 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.829
 actually betrayed on the scene before adac 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.119
 give us a few of the most popular tricks 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.950
 So organized banks already full 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.780
 lots of ideas come in handy 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.220
 is simply with the owner of the 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.020
 breaking into the vehicle and the keys 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.030
 to steal or and a semitrailer 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.240
 drive in and charge car directly 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.150
 another possibility would be with one 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.890
 with a laptop where you stop over one 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.360
 Diagnosis connection with a special 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.040
 software just stops when you are 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.690
 in it is ready to drive 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.520
 the alarm acceptance are actually 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.810
 nonsense because he no longer anyway 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.220
 that's what it means if it's now 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.500
 Not at all when it starts 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.210
 because you look like from there 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.070
 actually ineffective 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.630
 the police are repositioning extra layers 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.490
 the thieves to get on the track but 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.970
 in many cases, nothing is too easy 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.190
 do 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.750
 After discovering the police you 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.580
 from the variety of guided 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.740
 We have submitted the investigation 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.409
 it still with a big part 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.270
 to do that with well organized bands 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.409
 from Eastern Europe by 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.690
 Germany come here to serve 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.610
 which are now highly specialized 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.159
 what the industry throws on the market 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.080
 the other side, wide awake, does not sleep 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.729
 and tries to mend and so 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.179
 Of course, with immobilizer 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.680
 which would be desirable because straight 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.870
 does not give much away 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.540
 crime scene work would be for such offenses 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.360
 Of course, gps systems stuck in vehicles 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.560
 installed installed the tip of the 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.220
 we want police but smooth times 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.320
 pursue 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.510
 Martin will be better at his in the future 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.620
 Of course, watching bmw x5 is also important 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.570
 become curious 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.980
 what do the sender have in the car? 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.470
 hidden and in case of theft 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.060
 can actually be located on it 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.340
 and how do the things work? 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.569
 we want to know and leave one 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.640
 5 bmw equal to three 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.190
 Equip different directional transmitters 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.020
 with the carfinder from heer and for 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.520
 949 euros 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.800
 and the much cheaper 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:53.990
 alternative the blackbox from position 24 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:56.750
 for 465 euros both orientation systems 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.820
 work over gps gps stands for 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:04.220
 global position system and used 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:05.990
 satellites for navigation 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.760
 communication between car owner and 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.950
 The transmitter is transmitted via the mobile network 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.870
 settled therefore fall at all 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.820
 devices additionally the provider usual 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.390
 costs for a sim card and sms 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.490
 Charges to the blackbox tourist 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.380
 cigarette box size and with 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.900
 her black metal case stable and 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.030
 inconspicuously inconspicuous should be such 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.800
 systems better than for 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.690
 Of course, thieves also apply to tracking devices 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.330
 better not get caught 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.980
 the carfinder is initially noticeable 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.020
 but is smaller and can therefore be in 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.430
 Install the car in a particularly well-hidden way 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.170
 Both transmitters will be sent to the 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.040
 have connected vehicle battery 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.390
 but also an integrated one 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.460
 emergency power supply 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.140
 Thus, the car would therefore also after one 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.130
 Disconnect the battery for some more 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.200
 hours to locate 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.000
 for the smooth satellite 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.350
 additionally need to receive external 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.350
 antennae are connected 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.849
 the third comes with us on board is 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.830
 it is much less complicated to the gsm 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.629
 cell track of research needs no 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.640
 External antenna and will only have one 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:05.360
 Battery operated but up to ten days 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.220
 should keep 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.739
 the matchbox is big thing 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.599
 to have for 449 euros and thus if 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.120
 just barely the cheapest device 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.860
 to place instead of satellite the 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.160
 radio stations of the mobile radio network 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.600
 over the internet one should use the 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.460
 position of the vehicle now on 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.990
 can determine maps at any time 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.720
 every device he has for his own 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.580
 password protected web portal in 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.050
 seriousness is missing after a successful one 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.680
 order then really only the 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.680
 call at the police 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.430
 we want the regulatory systems now 

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:39.249
 but take a closer look 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.569
 for that we drive with our bmw 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:42.889
 different areas to see if 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:44.379
 martin kaufmann us too 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.909
 can track down everywhere 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:48.830
 the carfinder and the black box to 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:50.899
 also promise the car owner 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.330
 to alert by SMS when the car 

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:54.860
 to move without permission we want 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.330
 See how long it takes to martin 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.309
 Kaufman knows that we already know 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.770
 roll and after two minutes 

00:04:58.309 --> 00:05:03.589
 We are recognized by the blackbox 2 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.360
 respect the carfinder only after 

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:07.099
 twelve minutes alarm that she was in 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.199
 seriously ten minutes more projection 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:09.589
 for the thieves so here already 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.620
 clear 

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:13.939
 one to zero for the black box 2 martin 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.039
 Kaufman has now joined the three 

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:17.689
 web portals of our test devices logged in 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:19.669
 and should try to command the 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:21.529
 as accurate as possible location of the bmws 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.389
 determine 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.900
 our first test area is a flat one 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.520
 highway near cologne 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.870
 We are now right at the corner 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.639
 am wermelt acker and kölner street 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:34.229
 between Sinnersdorf and edge of 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:37.080
 Carfinder can be on the open road 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:38.430
 The cars actually locate one 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.990
 derek roads on the map not 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.030
 the location could be registered 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.139
 possibly by about five to a maximum of ten 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.840
 differ 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.460
 in practice, the blackbox meaningless 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.080
 2, the car can be just as accurate 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.350
 Unfortunately, localization is also here 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.850
 small side street not registered 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.350
 that the ssl track lies with his 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.910
 department good 500 meters from 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.669
 actual location of our car 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.830
 next to 500 meters would be in serious case too 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:04.169
 inaccurate and would the autoclave too many 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.910
 The gps offer escape options 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:08.639
 system is here so the mobile network 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.050
 clearly superior to this order 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:11.250
 does that change if we have one? 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.320
 choose another location 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.880
 The next test area is a dense one 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.380
 forest trail just before cologne 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.840
 we stop at the end of the bachemer 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.729
 highway the dense trees of ours 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.889
 second test area can be the gps 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:23.849
 reception of the cadre and the black box 2 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:26.310
 do not harm 

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:27.690
 as well the reception of the gsm soundtrack 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.160
 not this one, though 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:33.270
 real goal already good two 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:35.430
 miles misses look if we in 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.960
 our 580 meter long tunnel 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.410
 embarrass the transmitter 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.680
 can 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:42.120
 this is the rheinufer tunnel in cologne 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.610
 also here deliver carfinder and black 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.680
 box 2 initially exact results but 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.900
 only on the first 20 meters 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:52.250
 then the gps connection breaks off and 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.250
 more places are no more 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:57.320
 the gsl track also logs in 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.190
 50 meters until then the connection 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.230
 aborts 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:03.890
 but it is also good here again two 

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:05.960
 kilometer off as expected in 

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.610
 the underground parking we finally closing 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.890
 make all three devices limp and the 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.540
 Conclusions break off from the conclusion 

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.830
 carfinder can be almost down to the 

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.680
 meter exactly locate and settle 

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.010
 handle easily but costs 949 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.140
 Euro 

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.730
 the blackbox 2 is the orderly 

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.650
 Precision of your competitor in nothing 

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.210
 After has the faster motion alarm 

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:26.000
 and does not cost half as much 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.710

 to do while on the next step 

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:03.700
 for car-crafters finally the craft
