change and why would you change it maybe
offside<00:02:34.280> or<00:02:34.640> something<00:02:35.980> that's<00:02:36.980> a<00:02:37.099> tough<00:02:37.310> one

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
offside or something that's a tough one

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
without ever think but but I think it'd

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.600 
without ever think but but I think it'd
be<00:02:45.709> a<00:02:45.890> good<00:02:46.190> help

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
be a good help

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.300 
be a good help
even<00:02:47.360> just<00:02:47.510> for<00:02:47.750> for<00:02:47.959> tests<00:02:48.440> or<00:02:48.620> some<00:02:48.890> friendly

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.069 
though that wasn't about so I think not
so<00:03:13.609> much<00:03:13.790> not<00:03:14.060> to<00:03:14.180> change<00:03:14.450> completely<00:03:14.660> the

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
so much not to change completely the

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.580 
so much not to change completely the

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.680 
game but try to mix a little bit of
technology<00:03:19.340> into<00:03:19.639> the<00:03:19.760> game<00:03:19.910> try<00:03:20.239> to<00:03:20.299> help<00:03:20.510> the
