00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:23.389
 It seems like it's up to now What is the performance sp? 

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:27.809
 I would like to appeal what kind of thing it is 

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:28.269
 Heel 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:30.869
 Appeal I think that it is the characteristic that I worked hard here 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.940
 After all that power feel is just smooth 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.440
 But v-4 officials always want to feel comfortable 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.350
 By the way 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.260
 Concept of a car that lays out an engine 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.600
 Because it is a British sports tourer, it is anyway 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.399
 Comfortable and comfortable 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.330
 But it is to be sporty 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.239
 First of all, the hardest part is the arrangement with the English 4 no sono mind 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.249
 then 

00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:58.499
 How to put up a member of the clamp 

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:01.129
 It is because I must move my heart first 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.850
 28. The early 28. Then to 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.039
 It is Tomoki Suzuki of v, but 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:09.180
 Usually 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.560
 The first place and third place 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.790
 We use for bank in place called the second from the top this time this time 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.479
 The distinctive thing is the 14th front 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.250
 Well then number 23 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.509
 We use for area 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.140
 Low speed makes it more compact and also full length 

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:26.399
 Then the width too 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:27.570
 Put on a compact 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.680
 The course disappears at the hero's place and the spokesman is doing well 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.150
 It was significant when going in the form of one of the people 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.990
 In that it becomes very narrow 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.119
 If you look at au, it is not v school but v 29 people 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.130
 Arrive to be able to hold the ball on the ball 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.850
 You can take your riding position freely 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.850
 Prosperity as a votive car with a degree of freedom in design 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.790
 Very benefit for customers 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.430
 The best part for the customer 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.050
 Everywhere in the future, it's not a situation where the field is out or not 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.040
 Where can you run smoothly even sporty? 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.980
 Considering the system of air is now in why 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.000
 First of all, I want to make it as compact as possible 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.820
 I chose to ignore the station on the second floor 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:21.619
 However, even though it still has rotation but smooth legs 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:24.600
 I want to put out something close to Ryoichi because I want to 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.070
 Finish the number of revolutions of heyhey brush-like results in that 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.830
 Another advantage is to sk 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:33.649
 It's a schedule 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:38.400
 It can be made especially compact, especially when the ett becomes compact 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.619
 In front of the whole engine 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:43.449
 For customers to receive the UK 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:46.739
 Eat in the riding position or crown 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.059
 It has become a horse aid 

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:52.879
 I used motogp more often in 2005-2007 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.419
 I think just a spectroscope 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:58.099
 Last year It became 8004 when it was about to dance 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.629
 When 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:59.860
 Year of 2007 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.949
 I did it for 23 years 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.599
 The basic layout of the engine lies earlier 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.069
 I talked 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.549
 It is v type to make it compactly 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.209
 I would like to say that I will go into a long break 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.909
え eco eco eco brain 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.999
 Even if it is Eiji's traditional deterrent power of Honda 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:22.029
 I do it in the same way in the same system 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.019
 It is the first time in the air A newly adopted 10-8 bw this time 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.290
 If there is a throttle Yano system 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.059
 This is also the base, keep using it all the time 

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:37.059
 In particular, it has not only improved its performance. 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.279
 Eh this is how sporty to run and run smoothly 

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:41.019
 If 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.729
 Control the hero
