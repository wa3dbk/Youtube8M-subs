magic<00:01:02.910> very<00:01:03.180> clever<00:01:03.480> yes<00:01:03.930> well<00:01:04.199> then<00:01:04.439> if

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
magic very clever yes well then if

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.050 
magic very clever yes well then if
you're<00:01:04.860> ready<00:01:05.100> yes<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.909> course

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.319 

so<00:01:09.720> novus<00:01:10.049> holds<00:01:10.259> out<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> sword<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.180> does<00:01:12.180> that

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.329 
so novus holds out a sword and does that

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:13.969 
so novus holds out a sword and does that
yeah<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:13.049> given<00:01:13.259> a<00:01:13.320> fantastic<00:01:13.710> level<00:01:13.920> of

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
yeah it's given a fantastic level of

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.160 
yeah it's given a fantastic level of
power<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.549> Smith's<00:01:14.820> played<00:01:15.240> yay<00:01:15.600> find

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
power so Smith's played yay find

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.800 
power so Smith's played yay find
somebody's<00:01:16.590> blade<00:01:17.000> if<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.119> do<00:01:18.210> then<00:01:18.509> we'd

on<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.490> weapon<00:01:23.610> oh<00:01:23.909> yeah<00:01:24.329> i<00:01:24.360> think<00:01:24.570> i<00:01:24.780> know

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
on the weapon oh yeah i think i know

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.100 
on the weapon oh yeah i think i know
just<00:01:24.990> person<00:01:25.560> for<00:01:25.679> that<00:01:25.710> job<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:26.729> mean<00:01:26.939> me

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
just person for that job you mean me

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.179 
just person for that job you mean me
don't<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.200> think<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.439> weapon<00:01:28.799> would<00:01:28.920> suit

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
don't you think that weapon would suit

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.010 
don't you think that weapon would suit
you<00:01:29.310> pretty<00:01:29.580> well<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.479> you'd<00:01:30.630> be<00:01:30.780> able<00:01:30.869> to

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
you pretty well and you'd be able to

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.539 
you pretty well and you'd be able to
record<00:01:31.259> accurate<00:01:31.710> data<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:32.130> there's<00:01:32.369> no<00:01:32.429> one

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
record accurate data to there's no one

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.779 
record accurate data to there's no one
better<00:01:32.640> suited<00:01:32.789> to<00:01:33.119> take<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.450> that's<00:01:33.990> true<00:01:34.439> but

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
better suited to take it that's true but

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:36.590 
better suited to take it that's true but
I've<00:01:35.789> been<00:01:35.909> quite<00:01:36.060> comfortable<00:01:36.360> with<00:01:36.479> you

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
I've been quite comfortable with you

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.230 
I've been quite comfortable with you
using<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.990> yes<00:01:37.920> we<00:01:38.039> don't<00:01:38.220> have<00:01:38.369> any<00:01:38.670> choice<00:01:39.000> if

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
using it yes we don't have any choice if

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.210 
using it yes we don't have any choice if
the<00:01:39.360> client<00:01:39.689> himself<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.170> suggesting<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.770> will
