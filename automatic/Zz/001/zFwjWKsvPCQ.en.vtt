this is significant you guys research

this is significant you guys research
suggests<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.739> most<00:01:01.949> monkeys<00:01:02.399> in<00:01:02.519> captivity

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
suggests that most monkeys in captivity

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.700 
suggests that most monkeys in captivity
are<00:01:03.210> capable<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.780> learning<00:01:03.929> from<00:01:04.290> their<00:01:04.440> peers

are capable of learning from their peers
via<00:01:04.950> video<00:01:05.250> but<00:01:05.460> wild<00:01:05.700> monkeys<00:01:06.300> are<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.480> whole
