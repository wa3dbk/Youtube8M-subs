00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:10.370
 I'll show a braid 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:14.130
 in Mexico we call it fish tail 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.710
 this can be two or four for 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.200
 I think it's exactly the same 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.510
 is the famous braid of three and profane 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.120
 more but if you're as good first 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.170
 let's take the hair our model 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.150
 and will not leave because 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:34.060
 Well, the makeup is poor 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.470
 well let's take 2 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.500
 hair parts 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:42.770
 that is well unraveled and the only thing that 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.170
 let's do this part is not here 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.650
 from the front but from below the first 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:52.460
 strand of hair let's grab a 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:55.270
 part and we're going to move this part to 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.300
 side no 1 and 2 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.149
 now 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.750
 is that it's a very long town to take 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.979
 part of 2 and passed it to 1 and what 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.979
 mixed everything 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.910
 so too 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:16.150
 they are not they are not 33 giving the 302 but for 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.150
 here 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:24.650
 they were to see how it is going to be 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.650
 fish tail braid 230 of 4 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:34.380
 if it is seen that it is different truth 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:37.500
 he made these braids also very nice 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.509
 when they are so tight they are 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.509
 loose looks very elegant 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.360
 I was putting together 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.770
 grab here and pass them to 1 you grab the 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.960
 one obviously and so they are thicker than 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:00.329
 2 because they spend a good lock to 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.329
 another part of the one and passed it to 2 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.510
 is more chubby 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.510
