00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.900
 "The miracle period ends, a post-antibiotic era is waiting for us" 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.559
 Last year, in a key statement 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.380
 World Health Organization CEO said 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.019
 that we have a future, 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.650
 when some of our miracle cures stop working. 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.220
 "Post-antibiotic era poses 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.080
 the end of modern medicine in its present form. " 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.760
 Common infections such as nasopharyngitis or bruised knee 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.310
 they will threaten us in life. 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.561
 Recommendations to prevent this disaster included a global challenge 

00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:33.780
 "stop using antibiotics in food 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.420
 and consider therapeutic reasons. " 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.510
 In other words, use antibiotics only to treat sick animals. 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.989
 In the United States, the meat industry is consuming 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.820
 for non-sick livestock, millions of kilograms of antibiotics; 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.240
 in this way they promote their growth and prevent disease. 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.230
 In agricultural production, animals are often 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.289
 in cramped, stressful, unhygienic conditions. 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.870
 The FDA estimates that 80% of antimicrobial drugs consumed in the US 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.790
 goes to the meat industry every year. 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.750
 Penicillin discoverer warned us back in the 1940s that antibiotic abuse 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.500
 it will increase the resistance of bacteria, but the meat industry did not listen 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.140
 and began to administer penicillin to the chickens in tons. 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.360
 American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1977 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.800
 he began to take this threat seriously and suggested stopping it 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.690
 feeding livestock penicillins and tetracyclines. 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.330
 That was 10 years ago. 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.110
 "Since then, political power, agricultural large-scale production 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.220
 and effectively dispose of the pharmaceutical industry 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.780
 any legislative or regulatory measures 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.950
 and this firm connection of power cannot be broken. 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.970
 This unscrupulous practice was a threat to public health 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.700
 decades ago and yet there has been no change. 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.970
 Current meat production and animal husbandry are concentrated 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.610
 into a crowded, stressful environment that is allowed 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.800
 routine use of medicated feed. " 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.360
 This is the position they have already expressed in 1979 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.200
 representatives of the Office of Congress for Technology Assessment. 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.340
 "Current dependence on low dose antibiotics 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.410
 to increase or maintain production, that is, immediate benefits, 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.950
 it may be the Achilles heel of current production methods. " 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.000
 Industrial production uses antibiotics to compensate for bad conditions, 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.030
 which today characterize most modern agricultural production. 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.560
 The premises are crowded with animals and their waste, which affects 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.360
 animal immune system and disrupt normal physiological processes, 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.540
 for example, it damages the growth of animals. 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.390
 That's why a steady supply of antibiotics 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.060
 increases body weight by reducing infectious problems. 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.251
 The problem is that every animal that receives antibiotics 

00:02:51.251 --> 00:02:53.740
 becomes a "factory" for production and subsequent dissemination 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.420
 antibiotic resistant bacteria. 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.800
 The term "production farm" thus acquires a completely new dimension.
