 hello and welcome to my first 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.899
 part of my four-part video course 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:12.230
 the five simple steps to your own 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.230
 bild first step the right idea 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.980
 how to paint the right idea of ​​yours 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.980
 find your own picture 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.390
 and how to plan your first picture 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.690
 Now you should paint with them before 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.760
 start learning for a great sake and 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.160
 to paint a positive attitude 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.140
 even if their income does not immediately 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.240
 Should you set a very good one 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.970
 endurance or very much 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.650
 have endurance because they also paint 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.390
 learn a certain amount of time to acquire 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.080
 the different basic painting techniques 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.080
 need 

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:10.250
 But now with the plan I am 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.770
 to put something on her empty canvas 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.369
 and just start working unfortunately right 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.340
 Rare 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.320
 some of them are bubbling with ideas 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.640
 others do not know how to use them 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.280
 to start painting 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.530
 So I want to help those you with 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.750
 the idea of ​​painting a picture hard to do 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.579
 i want to show this human how 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.939
 you learn the most common mistakes while learning 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.939
 work around a lot of time and effort 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.929
 especially a lot of money to spare 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:43.000
 serious mistakes while painting 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:43.000
 Often there is no real desire to have it 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.060
 at first no right idea to have 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.660
 not to prepare properly so 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.660
 Just start 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.180
 I found that predominantly 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.310
 Stress bad mood or general 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.510
 bad well being very big 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.849
 creativity players are 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.310
 that's why it's not that easy at first 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:23.269
 a so-called dazzling idea for 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.269
 to find rhine 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.120
 that's why it's important at first 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.500
 find out what style you are 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.900
 actually want to do 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.390
 so there are some styles in 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.890
 the painting you see first 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.930
 once in your area for possible 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.820
 motifs for your pictures 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.070
 helpful also pictures of others 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.240
 be artist to appropriate ideas for her 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.950
 to find motivation 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.440
 or look at different books 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.640
 magazines or on the internet 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.500
 possible motives 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.080
 sometimes you see a picture and think 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.780
 that is the motive which is 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.580
 but they want to paint realistic 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.060
 and look for the style of painting 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.580
 trains and which they also dare 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.870
 But start with something simple 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.670
 I would be very happy if you give me 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.450
