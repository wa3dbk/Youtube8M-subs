just don't know oh my god you're right

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.280 
just don't know oh my god you're right
so<00:02:18.210> okay<00:02:19.210> but<00:02:19.240> here's<00:02:19.510> a<00:02:19.600> problem<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.230> that

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
so okay but here's a problem and that

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.750 
so okay but here's a problem and that
and<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:20.650> is<00:02:20.770> that<00:02:22.770> it's<00:02:23.770> not<00:02:23.860> just<00:02:24.280> adding

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
and that is that it's not just adding

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.240 
and that is that it's not just adding
omega-3<00:02:25.420> that's<00:02:25.870> reducing<00:02:26.440> omega-6

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
omega-3 that's reducing omega-6

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.640 
omega-3 that's reducing omega-6
and<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.670> average<00:02:28.030> American<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:29.140> ratio<00:02:29.590> of

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
and the average American the ratio of

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.950 
and the average American the ratio of
three<00:02:30.040> to<00:02:30.070> six<00:02:30.340> is<00:02:30.580> probably<00:02:31.390> somewhere<00:02:31.720> about

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
three to six is probably somewhere about

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.550 
three to six is probably somewhere about
like<00:02:32.200> one<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.590> 20<00:02:33.070> like<00:02:34.000> way<00:02:34.600> too<00:02:34.870> much<00:02:35.140> omega-6

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
like one to 20 like way too much omega-6

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.220 
like one to 20 like way too much omega-6
okay<00:02:36.550> so<00:02:37.030> when<00:02:37.180> we<00:02:37.300> look<00:02:37.450> at<00:02:37.540> strategies<00:02:38.200> for

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
okay so when we look at strategies for

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.280 
okay so when we look at strategies for
treating<00:02:39.220> mood<00:02:39.610> disorders<00:02:40.330> with<00:02:40.690> omega-3

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
treating mood disorders with omega-3

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.190 
treating mood disorders with omega-3
fatty<00:02:41.560> acids<00:02:42.070> that<00:02:42.250> it's<00:02:43.150> not<00:02:44.110> only

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
fatty acids that it's not only

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.260 
fatty acids that it's not only
increasing<00:02:44.710> omega-3<00:02:45.190> but<00:02:45.400> it's<00:02:45.550> decreasing

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
increasing omega-3 but it's decreasing

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.570 
increasing omega-3 but it's decreasing
pretty<00:02:46.900> dramatically<00:02:47.440> omega-6<00:02:48.130> okay<00:02:50.580> the

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
pretty dramatically omega-6 okay the

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.010 
pretty dramatically omega-6 okay the
original<00:02:52.030> studies<00:02:52.330> within<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.630> bipolar

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
original studies within the bipolar

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.760 
original studies within the bipolar
disorder<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.370> bipolar<00:02:54.810> it's<00:02:55.810> turning

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
disorder and the bipolar it's turning

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.610 
disorder and the bipolar it's turning
that<00:02:56.860> not<00:02:57.130> to<00:02:57.310> really<00:02:57.489> be<00:02:57.670> very<00:02:57.700> helpful

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
that not to really be very helpful

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.520 
that not to really be very helpful
I<00:02:59.760> just<00:03:00.760> just<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.270> trivia<00:03:01.780> but<00:03:02.050> the<00:03:02.230> first

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
I just just a trivia but the first

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.590 
I just just a trivia but the first
studies<00:03:02.830> they<00:03:02.950> did<00:03:03.010> showed<00:03:03.459> a<00:03:03.489> little<00:03:04.090> bit<00:03:04.390> of

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
studies they did showed a little bit of

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.220 
studies they did showed a little bit of
efficacy<00:03:04.959> there<00:03:05.890> had<00:03:06.070> people<00:03:06.510> take<00:03:07.510> fish<00:03:08.110> oil

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
efficacy there had people take fish oil

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.660 
efficacy there had people take fish oil
capsules<00:03:09.120> they<00:03:10.120> took<00:03:10.480> nine<00:03:10.900> grams<00:03:11.650> and<00:03:12.190> so

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
capsules they took nine grams and so

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.760 
capsules they took nine grams and so
that<00:03:12.820> these<00:03:12.970> these<00:03:13.300> official<00:03:14.170> capsules<00:03:14.650> were

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
that these these official capsules were

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.310 
that these these official capsules were
500<00:03:15.430> milligrams<00:03:15.850> so<00:03:16.120> they'd<00:03:16.209> be<00:03:16.300> taking<00:03:16.570> 18<00:03:17.110> of

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
500 milligrams so they'd be taking 18 of

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.010 
500 milligrams so they'd be taking 18 of
these<00:03:17.440> a<00:03:17.470> day<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:18.670> it<00:03:18.760> got<00:03:18.850> diarrhea<00:03:19.480> and

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
these a day and it got diarrhea and

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.440 
these a day and it got diarrhea and
upset<00:03:20.650> stomach<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:21.459> they<00:03:21.580> gained<00:03:21.820> weight<00:03:22.150> and

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
upset stomach and they gained weight and

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.120 
upset stomach and they gained weight and
when<00:03:22.570> they<00:03:22.660> berkeley<00:03:23.080> smell<00:03:23.350> like<00:03:23.470> dead<00:03:23.770> fish

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
when they berkeley smell like dead fish

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.699 
when they berkeley smell like dead fish
you<00:03:24.610> know<00:03:25.180> and<00:03:25.989> then<00:03:26.170> i<00:03:26.230> found<00:03:26.410> that<00:03:26.620> it

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
you know and then i found that it

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.420 
you know and then i found that it
actually<00:03:26.739> didn't<00:03:27.430> really<00:03:27.790> work<00:03:28.030> that<00:03:28.060> way<00:03:28.420> so

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
actually didn't really work that way so

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.080 
actually didn't really work that way so
too<00:03:30.430> bad<00:03:30.640> okay<00:03:31.239> now<00:03:31.830> but<00:03:32.830> where<00:03:33.700> you<00:03:33.790> really

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
too bad okay now but where you really

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.930 
too bad okay now but where you really
see<00:03:34.300> some<00:03:35.140> efficacy<00:03:35.560> showing<00:03:36.250> up<00:03:36.400> is<00:03:36.580> in<00:03:36.760> two

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
see some efficacy showing up is in two

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.020 
see some efficacy showing up is in two
areas<00:03:37.330> one<00:03:37.600> is<00:03:37.739> depression<00:03:38.739> and<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.640> other<00:03:39.790> is

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
areas one is depression and the other is

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.150 
areas one is depression and the other is
impulsivity<00:03:40.860> okay<00:03:41.860> so<00:03:42.760> here<00:03:43.770> bad<00:03:44.770> news<00:03:45.010> for
