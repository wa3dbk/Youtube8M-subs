another<00:01:01.230> one<00:01:01.350> draw<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.510> as<00:01:03.510> I've<00:01:03.629> said

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
another one draw and as I've said

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:08.139 
earlier I think the other thing that was
in<00:01:06.299> trouble<00:01:06.509> delivered<00:01:07.139> last<00:01:07.380> year<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.770> think

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
in trouble delivered last year I think

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:11.779 
in trouble delivered last year I think
