00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hi to all the enemies is Charlie 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.270
 ch'ti on is still there for a tutorial but 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.550
 rather for a tutorial bonus in 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.120
 effect on the famous piston doors 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.860
 so we ended up on this staircase 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.920
 I showed you the animals too 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.630
 switch all that and here I come back with 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.880
 these here is a door that makes 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.140
 three cubes out of three there is a square at 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.010
 center so it's not good to have a 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.420
 a vision on on what is behind 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.900
 the principle is we walk in the footsteps 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.759
 pressure and basically we have these three 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.190
 kubla that shifts to each side and 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.809
 the two middle years 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.280
 it's easier to do and 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.780
 which is the most interesting too 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.320
 it's about doing it on the least space 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.360
 possible 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.730
 so as you see apart at the level 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.550
 pressure plates everything is done on 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.690
 one block wide so we're going 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.670
 so start already how are we 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.860
 do that we have our pressure plates on 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.079
 get the current just below and 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.180
 he is sent on each side to 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.270
 activate the three pistons so we have a 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.550
 inverter here that will activate the block here 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.049
 the block here the block here and so the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.360
 three pistons I made diagram next 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.430
 for this to be more understandable 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.700
 basically that's so I remove the torch that 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.590
 here yeah what happens is already put 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.380
 a torch here that feeds this blockage 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.270
 so that feeds this redstone that goes 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.280
 so feed this block there and these blocks has 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.570
 so these two pistons but that will also 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.080
 feed the current that passes over 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.560
 and who feeds this piston here and for 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.780
 feed the diot piston is simple 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.229
 take the red stone here and continue to 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.869
 on it up and I put a deadline there 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.509
 in fact for this piston has often 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.850
 at the same time as the second is the 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.500
 second actually what happens is 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.899
 that you said we had recovered the 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.490
 running under the pressure plates here 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.280
 the current will activate an inverter so 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.009
 the torch that here so he's going to turn off 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.680
 the current that is there and with a beret 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.439
 henry peter is going to have and peter of 26 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.540
 rather and well the piston here that in 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.869
 below will be lowered and to have the 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.110
 same delay well we must add a 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.110
 repeater here 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.950
 so we could have done that 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.370
 and so that's it for 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.500
 the opening and finally to turn in 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.569
 a meaning and so here it will have to be done 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.120
 the same thing in the other direction and for 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.230
 avoid having to redo everything that he 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.099
 to do just that is 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.830
 recover the current below the same 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:33.110
 at the level of the three pressure plates 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.110
 ac went to inject it simply 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.180
 that's in the stream that is actually 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.830
 under the first pressure plates 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.130
 so that's exactly the same 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.170
 thing 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.940
 and to avoid having problems with 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.250
 two lengths of redstone 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.209
 well we'll just take a 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:54.799
 ris peter is the master here that's it and 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.580
 normally we walk on it open 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.110
 so that's about a 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.799
 last for pistons it's a small 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.540
 bonus episode 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.730
 I hope you have enjoyed it anyway 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.810
 it completes a little and I also benefit 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.780
 to represent his who makes it the 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.609
 future finally the wheat farm of my 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.019
 creation that I invented by 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.260
 inspiration from minecraft zephyr 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.120
 for those who know and it will be my 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.500
 next a tutorial so this is what you 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.359
 waits 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.709
 meanwhile what is video subscribe

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.030
 questions especially do not hesitate and 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.329
 join the monster cube server that 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.970
 is to know pvp factions and hunter whose 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.970
