you what a lot of people think it is
right<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.029> get<00:00:27.300> right<00:00:27.539> into<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:27.990> basically<00:00:28.650> a

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
right to get right into it basically a

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.229 
right to get right into it basically a
DVD<00:00:29.310> decoder<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:30.029> either<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:31.340> function<00:00:32.340> on<00:00:32.790> a

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
DVD decoder is either a function on a

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.850 
DVD decoder is either a function on a
DVD<00:00:33.930> player<00:00:33.960> as<00:00:34.559> hardware<00:00:35.100> or<00:00:35.579> it's<00:00:36.510> a

DVD player as hardware or it's a

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.889 
DVD player as hardware or it's a
software<00:00:37.860> plug-in<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.610> can<00:00:38.969> integrate<00:00:39.239> into

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
software plug-in that can integrate into

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.869 
software plug-in that can integrate into
DVD<00:00:40.710> playback<00:00:40.980> software<00:00:43.670> essentially<00:00:44.670> all

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
DVD playback software essentially all

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.520 
DVD playback software essentially all
DVD<00:00:45.390> video<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:46.230> encoded<00:00:46.739> as<00:00:47.129> mpeg-2<00:00:47.820> and

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
DVD video is encoded as mpeg-2 and

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.170 
DVD video is encoded as mpeg-2 and
because<00:00:49.530> that's<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.920> proprietary<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.760> video

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
because that's a proprietary a video

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.869 
because that's a proprietary a video
format<00:00:52.160> you<00:00:53.160> need<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.430> decoder<00:00:55.340> to<00:00:56.340> playback

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
format you need a decoder to playback

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.650 
format you need a decoder to playback
that<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.930> MPEG<00:00:58.469> files<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.750> because<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.780> that

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
that the MPEG files and because of that

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.090 
that the MPEG files and because of that
that's<00:01:03.660> why<00:01:06.380> that's<00:01:07.380> why<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.680> type<00:01:08.070> of

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
that's why that's why this type of

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.370 
that's why that's why this type of
plug-in<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.700> needed<00:01:09.090> for<00:01:09.330> software<00:01:10.110> players

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
plug-in is needed for software players

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.140 
plug-in is needed for software players
and<00:01:10.740> that's<00:01:11.280> most<00:01:11.490> likely<00:01:11.729> what<00:01:12.000> you're

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
and that's most likely what you're

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.380 
and that's most likely what you're
looking<00:01:12.450> for<00:01:12.799> so<00:01:13.799> if<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.729> just<00:01:14.909> keep<00:01:15.119> reading

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
looking for so if you just keep reading

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.460 
looking for so if you just keep reading
below<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:16.020> video<00:01:16.380> I'll<00:01:17.100> list<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.580> few<00:01:18.470> DVD

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
below this video I'll list a few DVD

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.590 
below this video I'll list a few DVD
decoder<00:01:19.860> plug-ins<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.670> work<00:01:20.970> with<00:01:21.270> either

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
decoder plug-ins that work with either

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.170 
decoder plug-ins that work with either
Windows<00:01:22.080> Media<00:01:22.290> Player<00:01:22.650> or<00:01:22.890> as<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.939> standalone

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
Windows Media Player or as a standalone

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:35.680 
Windows Media Player or as a standalone
device<00:01:27.560> as<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.619> DVD<00:01:29.100> player<00:01:29.329> software

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.460 

okay<00:01:36.690> and<00:01:36.930> now<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.680> lot<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.190> people<00:01:38.400> think<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:39.470> DVD

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
okay and now a lot of people think a DVD

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.270 
okay and now a lot of people think a DVD
decoder<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.420> like<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> DVD<00:01:42.870> ripper<00:01:43.260> or<00:01:43.440> DVD

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
decoder is like a DVD ripper or DVD

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.330 
decoder is like a DVD ripper or DVD
video<00:01:44.850> extractor

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
video extractor

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.270 
video extractor
it<00:01:47.580> can<00:01:47.760> easily<00:01:47.940> be<00:01:48.800> thought<00:01:49.800> of<00:01:49.830> that<00:01:50.100> way

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
it can easily be thought of that way

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.160 
it can easily be thought of that way
because<00:01:50.550> when<00:01:50.820> you're<00:01:50.940> when<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.840> decode<00:01:52.110> a

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
because when you're when you decode a

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.660 
because when you're when you decode a
video<00:01:52.530> that's<00:01:52.830> essentially<00:01:53.400> what<00:01:53.550> you're

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
video that's essentially what you're

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.550 
video that's essentially what you're
doing<00:01:54.229> but<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:55.650> case<00:01:56.660> do<00:01:57.660> you<00:01:57.720> an<00:01:57.900> actual

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
doing but in this case do you an actual

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.219 
doing but in this case do you an actual
DVD<00:01:58.770> decoder<00:01:59.220> only<00:01:59.850> allows<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.509> playback<00:02:00.960> of

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
DVD decoder only allows the playback of

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.880 
DVD decoder only allows the playback of
DVD<00:02:01.950> video<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:02.820> if<00:02:03.210> you're<00:02:03.540> looking<00:02:03.690> to<00:02:04.020> rip<00:02:04.590> or

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
DVD video so if you're looking to rip or

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.529 
DVD video so if you're looking to rip or
extract<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:06.060> video<00:02:06.390> from<00:02:06.660> a<00:02:06.780> DVD<00:02:06.960> disc<00:02:07.350> then

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
extract the video from a DVD disc then

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.060 
extract the video from a DVD disc then
look<00:02:09.539> below<00:02:09.840> this<00:02:09.959> video<00:02:10.320> and<00:02:10.679> I'll<00:02:10.890> have<00:02:11.039> a

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
look below this video and I'll have a

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.960 
look below this video and I'll have a
link<00:02:11.400> on<00:02:11.900> there<00:02:12.900> on<00:02:13.830> where<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.489> need<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.820> be

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
link on there on where you need to be

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.290 
link on there on where you need to be
looking<00:02:15.150> for<00:02:15.510> DVD<00:02:15.870> rippers<00:02:16.230> or<00:02:16.500> extractors

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
looking for DVD rippers or extractors

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.110 
looking for DVD rippers or extractors
okay<00:02:18.300> so<00:02:18.930> that's<00:02:19.260> just<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.590> quick<00:02:20.340> summary<00:02:20.880> of

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
okay so that's just a quick summary of

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.910 
okay so that's just a quick summary of
what<00:02:21.239> a<00:02:21.450> DVD<00:02:21.870> decoder<00:02:22.200> is<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.650> then<00:02:22.739> hopefully

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
what a DVD decoder is and then hopefully

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.970 
what a DVD decoder is and then hopefully
it<00:02:23.340> gives<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:23.850> a<00:02:23.910> little<00:02:24.150> more<00:02:24.270> of<00:02:24.830> it<00:02:25.830> gives

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
it gives you a little more of it gives

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.830 
it gives you a little more of it gives
you<00:02:26.070> a<00:02:26.160> clearer<00:02:26.430> picture<00:02:26.820> on<00:02:26.850> exactly<00:02:27.510> what

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
you a clearer picture on exactly what

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.600 
you a clearer picture on exactly what
you<00:02:28.320> should<00:02:28.500> be<00:02:28.590> looking<00:02:28.709> for<00:02:28.890> thanks<00:02:29.489> for
