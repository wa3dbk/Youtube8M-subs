00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
look at first one it's it's the obvious

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.520 
look at first one it's it's the obvious
it's<00:05:16.879> the<00:05:17.330> obvious<00:05:17.449> choice<00:05:17.750> I<00:05:18.139> mean<00:05:18.319> sure<00:05:18.500> some

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
it's the obvious choice I mean sure some

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.800 
it's the obvious choice I mean sure some
people<00:05:19.009> can<00:05:19.129> argue<00:05:19.460> I<00:05:19.639> think<00:05:20.150> flak<00:05:20.389> jackets

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
people can argue I think flak jackets

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.409 
people can argue I think flak jackets
better<00:05:21.050> and<00:05:21.469> the<00:05:22.099> end<00:05:22.219> of<00:05:22.370> the<00:05:22.460> day<00:05:22.639> ghost<00:05:23.180> is

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
better and the end of the day ghost is

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.230 
better and the end of the day ghost is
probably<00:05:23.719> the<00:05:23.870> obvious<00:05:24.259> pick<00:05:24.500> and<00:05:24.800> it<00:05:25.759> makes

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
probably the obvious pick and it makes

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.990 
probably the obvious pick and it makes
UAV<00:05:26.930> useless<00:05:27.590> and<00:05:27.830> it<00:05:28.430> makes<00:05:28.580> half<00:05:28.819> your

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
UAV useless and it makes half your
