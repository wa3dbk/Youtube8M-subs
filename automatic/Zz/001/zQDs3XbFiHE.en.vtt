there<00:02:56.130> is<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.280> bit<00:02:56.520> of<00:02:56.610> tax<00:02:56.880> but<00:02:57.270> that<00:02:57.570> wouldn't

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
there is a bit of tax but that wouldn't

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.810 
there is a bit of tax but that wouldn't
really<00:02:58.170> do<00:02:58.740> that<00:02:58.770> much<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.340> only<00:02:59.490> maybe

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
really do that much it only maybe

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.500 
really do that much it only maybe
maximum<00:03:00.600> drop<00:03:01.590> off<00:03:01.800> a<00:03:01.830> hundred<00:03:02.100> coins<00:03:02.520> so

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
maximum drop off a hundred coins so

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.890 
maximum drop off a hundred coins so
maybe<00:03:04.020> you'll<00:03:04.350> only<00:03:04.680> be<00:03:04.890> earning<00:03:05.450> six<00:03:06.450> hundred

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900
