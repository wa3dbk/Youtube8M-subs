what we're facing today is a world that
is<00:03:58.829> in<00:03:59.159> late-stage<00:03:59.430> caterpillar<00:04:00.620> so<00:04:01.620> it

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
is in late-stage caterpillar so it

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.280 
is in late-stage caterpillar so it

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
becomes very important for us to let go

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.190 
becomes very important for us to let go
of<00:04:04.469> the<00:04:04.590> old<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:05.209> start<00:04:06.209> to<00:04:06.329> gravitate<00:04:06.870> to<00:04:07.079> the
