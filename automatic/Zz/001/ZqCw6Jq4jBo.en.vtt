00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
for you it just means that you've got to

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.060 
for you it just means that you've got to
think<00:00:33.540> about<00:00:34.050> rooting<00:00:34.410> your<00:00:34.500> device<00:00:34.559> look

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
think about rooting your device look

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.470 
think about rooting your device look
into<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.370> do<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> bit<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.790> research<00:00:36.000> and

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
into that do a bit of research and

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.380 
into that do a bit of research and
decide<00:00:36.780> if<00:00:36.899> it's<00:00:37.050> for<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.820> for<00:00:38.820> some<00:00:38.969> devices

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
decide if it's for you for some devices

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.150 
decide if it's for you for some devices
it's<00:00:39.570> it's<00:00:39.809> easier<00:00:40.290> than<00:00:40.410> others<00:00:40.680> for<00:00:40.860> this

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
it's it's easier than others for this

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.369 
it's it's easier than others for this
device<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.489> was<00:00:41.700> really<00:00:42.059> hard<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:43.230> up

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
device that was really hard so it's up

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.479 
device that was really hard so it's up
to<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.590> whether<00:00:43.710> or<00:00:43.800> not<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.070> can<00:00:44.219> be

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
to you whether or not you can be

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.680 
to you whether or not you can be
bothered<00:00:44.730> putting<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.210> effort<00:00:45.329> but

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
bothered putting in the effort but

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.880 
bothered putting in the effort but
basically<00:00:45.989> what<00:00:46.170> I'm<00:00:46.260> going<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.410> show<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.710> in

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
basically what I'm going to show you in

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.850 
basically what I'm going to show you in
this<00:00:47.039> video<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:48.420> iOS<00:00:48.899> 8<00:00:49.110> reach<00:00:49.530> ability

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
this video is the iOS 8 reach ability

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.860 
this video is the iOS 8 reach ability
feature<00:00:50.309> for<00:00:50.760> Android<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.360> I'm<00:00:51.719> going<00:00:51.840> to

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
feature for Android and I'm going to

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.090 
feature for Android and I'm going to
show<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.379> when<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.739> double<00:00:53.010> tap

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
show you so that when you double tap

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.439 
show you so that when you double tap
your<00:00:53.250> home<00:00:53.399> button<00:00:54.199> it<00:00:55.199> makes<00:00:56.030> it<00:00:57.030> happen<00:00:57.270> so

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
your home button it makes it happen so

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.430 
your home button it makes it happen so
that's<00:00:57.600> what<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.840> looks<00:00:57.989> like<00:00:58.109> that's<00:00:58.289> what

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
that's what it looks like that's what

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.410 
that's what it looks like that's what
reach<00:00:58.710> ability<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.940> only<00:01:00.120> difference

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
reach ability is the only difference

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.849 
reach ability is the only difference
between<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:00.899> iOS<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.710> doesn't

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
between this and iOS is that it doesn't

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.799 
between this and iOS is that it doesn't
do<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.190> nice<00:01:02.399> smooth<00:01:02.789> animation<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.719> it

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
do the nice smooth animation that it

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.630 
do the nice smooth animation that it
does<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.589> you're<00:01:04.680> going<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.860> need<00:01:04.979> three

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
does so you're going to need three

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.950 
does so you're going to need three
different<00:01:05.790> apps<00:01:06.090> for<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.570> first<00:01:06.780> is

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
different apps for this the first is

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.160 
different apps for this the first is
called<00:01:07.229> xposed<00:01:08.100> installer<00:01:08.479> i'll<00:01:09.479> put<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
called xposed installer i'll put the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.560 
called xposed installer i'll put the
link<00:01:10.350> for<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.590> below<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.390> you're<00:01:12.390> going<00:01:12.510> to

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
need one hand mode and gravity box

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.160 
need one hand mode and gravity box
they're<00:01:16.650> both<00:01:16.950> found<00:01:17.369> within<00:01:17.670> exposed<00:01:18.420> so

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.280 

so<00:01:35.960> there's<00:01:36.140> gravity<00:01:36.470> box<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:41.020> there's<00:01:42.020> one

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
so there's gravity box and there's one

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.900 
so there's gravity box and there's one
hand<00:01:42.560> mode<00:01:42.830> so<00:01:43.100> I've<00:01:43.160> got<00:01:43.400> both<00:01:43.430> of<00:01:43.640> these

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.780 
down so just trial and error this I've
made<00:02:00.080> mine<00:02:00.290> 300<00:02:00.680> I've<00:02:01.100> feel<00:02:01.550> like<00:02:01.580> that

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
made mine 300 I've feel like that

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.210 
made mine 300 I've feel like that
matches<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.330> iOS<00:02:02.690> reach<00:02:02.930> ability<00:02:03.200> but<00:02:04.160> you

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
matches the iOS reach ability but you

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.500 
matches the iOS reach ability but you
can<00:02:04.370> make<00:02:04.460> it<00:02:04.580> more<00:02:04.760> you<00:02:04.940> can<00:02:05.060> make<00:02:05.090> it<00:02:05.270> less

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
can make it more you can make it less

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.960 
can make it more you can make it less
but<00:02:05.900> 300<00:02:06.440> is<00:02:06.530> probably<00:02:06.800> about<00:02:07.040> as<00:02:07.250> minimum<00:02:07.790> as

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
but 300 is probably about as minimum as

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.030 
but 300 is probably about as minimum as
you<00:02:08.060> want<00:02:08.240> to<00:02:08.300> go<00:02:08.450> I<00:02:08.690> still<00:02:09.140> find<00:02:09.380> a<00:02:09.470> little<00:02:09.920> bit

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
you want to go I still find a little bit

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.650 
you want to go I still find a little bit
hard<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.369> reach<00:02:10.550> things<00:02:10.850> every<00:02:11.150> on<00:02:11.270> then<00:02:11.420> so

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
hard to reach things every on then so

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.990 
hard to reach things every on then so
but<00:02:12.530> I<00:02:12.590> don't<00:02:12.680> want<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.010> lose<00:02:13.310> all<00:02:13.340> my<00:02:13.610> apps<00:02:13.820> on
