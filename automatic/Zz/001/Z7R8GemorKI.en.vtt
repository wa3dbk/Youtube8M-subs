00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
Prime and it inspired me to make some

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.689 
Prime and it inspired me to make some
changes<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.179> mine<00:00:15.650> but<00:00:16.650> before<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.190> do<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.490> I

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
changes to mine but before I do that I

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.250 
changes to mine but before I do that I
wanted<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.090> go<00:00:18.240> ahead<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.570> document<00:00:19.080> what<00:00:19.230> I

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
wanted to go ahead and document what I

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.590 
wanted to go ahead and document what I
had<00:00:19.529> already<00:00:19.920> made<00:00:20.400> in<00:00:20.699> case<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.510> know

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
had already made in case it you know

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.290 
had already made in case it you know
gets<00:00:21.990> destroyed<00:00:22.410> or<00:00:22.590> whatever<00:00:22.939> so<00:00:23.939> I'm<00:00:24.210> gonna

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
gets destroyed or whatever so I'm gonna

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.300 
gets destroyed or whatever so I'm gonna
say<00:00:24.539> up<00:00:24.660> front<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:25.170> is<00:00:25.230> very<00:00:25.529> largely<00:00:25.920> based

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
say up front this is very largely based

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.929 
say up front this is very largely based
on<00:00:26.990> Chris's<00:00:27.990> design<00:00:28.380> he<00:00:29.279> has<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.429> series<00:00:29.910> of

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
on Chris's design he has a series of

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.189 
on Chris's design he has a series of
videos<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.480> can<00:00:30.599> teach<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.840> how<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:30.960> make<00:00:31.170> a

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
videos that can teach you how to make a

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.819 
videos that can teach you how to make a
basic<00:00:31.470> one<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:32.450> did<00:00:33.450> those<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.020> then<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.260> kind<00:00:34.770> of

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
basic one I did those and then I kind of

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.030 
basic one I did those and then I kind of
upgraded<00:00:35.219> them<00:00:35.989> that<00:00:36.989> being<00:00:37.230> said<00:00:37.530> his<00:00:37.829> is

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
upgraded them that being said his is

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.889 
upgraded them that being said his is
obviously<00:00:38.670> better<00:00:38.910> he's<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.270> master<00:00:39.660> at<00:00:39.750> this

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
obviously better he's the master at this

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.540 
obviously better he's the master at this
so<00:00:40.800> we're<00:00:41.070> just<00:00:41.100> gonna<00:00:41.250> do<00:00:41.460> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
so we're just gonna do the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.180 
so we're just gonna do the
transformation<00:00:41.940> real<00:00:42.300> fast<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:43.100> that'll<00:00:44.100> be

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
transformation real fast and that'll be

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.180 
transformation real fast and that'll be
that<00:00:44.510> okay<00:00:46.969> so<00:00:48.050> first<00:00:49.050> thing<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.770> we<00:00:49.860> have<00:00:50.039> to

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
that okay so first thing that we have to

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.569 
that okay so first thing that we have to
do<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.820> get<00:00:51.480> him<00:00:51.600> standing<00:00:51.989> upright<00:00:52.430> this<00:00:53.430> is

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
do is get him standing upright this is

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.729 
do is get him standing upright this is
pretty<00:00:53.820> common<00:00:54.120> swing<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.140> arms<00:00:55.410> out<00:00:55.559> like

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
pretty common swing the arms out like

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.779 
pretty common swing the arms out like
that<00:00:57.260> at<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.530> point<00:00:58.829> you're<00:00:59.250> able<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.489> move

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
that at that point you're able to move

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.229 
that at that point you're able to move
the<00:01:00.359> legs<00:01:00.570> freely<00:01:01.699> swinging<00:01:02.699> up<00:01:02.820> like<00:01:03.000> this

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
the legs freely swinging up like this

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.600 
the legs freely swinging up like this
turn<00:01:04.140> around<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.559> can<00:01:04.710> see<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.949> feet<00:01:05.250> I

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
turn around so you can see the feet I

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.700 
turn around so you can see the feet I
did<00:01:06.180> not<00:01:06.299> spend<00:01:06.570> much<00:01:06.810> time<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.200> feet<00:01:07.380> I'll

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
did not spend much time on the feet I'll

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.460 
did not spend much time on the feet I'll
be<00:01:07.830> honest<00:01:08.070> there<00:01:08.280> they're<00:01:09.049> pretty<00:01:10.049> low

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
be honest there they're pretty low

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.670 
be honest there they're pretty low
quality<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.220> then<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.420> had<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> kind<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.500> an

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
quality and then I had a kind of an

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.670 
quality and then I had a kind of an
usual<00:01:14.100> way<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.460> rotating<00:01:15.030> his<00:01:15.119> waist<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.810> order

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
usual way of rotating his waist in order

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.590 
usual way of rotating his waist in order
to<00:01:16.770> get<00:01:16.950> things<00:01:17.189> out<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.520> way<00:01:17.700> open<00:01:18.509> his

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
to get things out of the way open his

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.580 
to get things out of the way open his
chest<00:01:19.040> lift<00:01:20.040> up<00:01:20.189> his<00:01:20.340> grill<00:01:21.320> then<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.409> can

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
chest lift up his grill then you can

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.039 
chest lift up his grill then you can
spin<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.100> around<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.990> put<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.619> back<00:01:25.830> down

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
spin this around and put that back down

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.200 
spin this around and put that back down
he<00:01:28.049> gets<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.290> little<00:01:28.439> back<00:01:28.770> heavy<00:01:29.040> for<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> second

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
he gets a little back heavy for a second

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.319 
he gets a little back heavy for a second
I'll<00:01:30.600> leave<00:01:30.780> his<00:01:30.900> legs<00:01:31.110> together<00:01:31.290> for<00:01:31.740> now

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
I'll leave his legs together for now

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:40.380 
I'll leave his legs together for now
rotate<00:01:33.329> his<00:01:33.509> shoulders<00:01:33.869> out

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390

bring his head up kind of give him some

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.880 
bring his head up kind of give him some
pecks<00:01:45.230> a<00:01:45.590> little<00:01:45.830> bit<00:01:46.030> so<00:01:47.030> he<00:01:47.150> looks<00:01:47.330> better

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
pecks a little bit so he looks better

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:54.370 
pecks a little bit so he looks better
separate<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:49.040> legs<00:01:49.430> some<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:53.050> let's<00:01:54.050> go

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.040 
separate the legs some and let's go
ahead<00:01:54.470> and<00:01:54.680> give<00:01:54.800> him<00:01:54.920> a<00:01:55.040> hand<00:01:57.910> and<00:01:58.910> I'm<00:01:59.900> gonna

redesign this I've had some trouble

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.250 
redesign this I've had some trouble
getting<00:02:03.470> his<00:02:03.830> hand<00:02:04.040> to<00:02:04.160> actually<00:02:04.460> go<00:02:04.640> on<00:02:05.260> in

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
getting his hand to actually go on in

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.040 
getting his hand to actually go on in
the<00:02:06.950> center<00:02:07.430> okay<00:02:08.420> there<00:02:08.810> we<00:02:08.899> go

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
the center okay there we go

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.900 
the center okay there we go
and<00:02:09.649> then<00:02:10.040> the<00:02:10.130> other<00:02:10.280> I<00:02:10.340> didn't<00:02:10.640> even<00:02:10.760> make

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
and then the other I didn't even make

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.120 
and then the other I didn't even make
another<00:02:11.270> hand<00:02:11.570> because<00:02:12.080> I<00:02:12.230> very<00:02:12.650> much<00:02:12.800> always

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
another hand because I very much always

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.880 
another hand because I very much always
display<00:02:13.490> him<00:02:13.610> with<00:02:13.700> his<00:02:13.820> energy<00:02:13.970> axe<00:02:17.620> so<00:02:18.620> let's

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
display him with his energy axe so let's
