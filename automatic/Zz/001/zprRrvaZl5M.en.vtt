00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:10.730
 hello you love i thought so 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.529
 make a last minute today 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.779
 Christmas present and one 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:16.820
 You can make homemade raspberry vinegar 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:18.650
 charge him for delicatessen for a lot of money 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.620
 but you can buy it completely 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.690
 Just do it yourself and as a present 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.210
 he is very popular i actually do 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.770
 every year in portions for different 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.930
 those of the first over the year then people 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.149
 has gone out the order always after 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.660
 so try it out really is 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.829
 Simply you only need two ingredients and 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.690
 it actually works much easier 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.280
 no more 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.899
 it takes a while until it does 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.579
 It's done because you just have it 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.170
 We have to let it stop for a while 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.429
 christmas the week is already enough 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.929
 if you still have one yourself 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:49.399
 wanted to start the bottle that the 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:51.309
 maybe even a week longer 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.600
 then he go a little bit more 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.100
 I wish you a lot of fun thank you 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.889
 that you have turned on if it is you 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.719
 At the end, we liked it 

00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:01.280
 I'm positive if the others 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.690
 you want to see videos subscribe to me her 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.829

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.600

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.619

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.299
 fun with the video 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.030
 We need 500 milliliters for that 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.770
 white balsamic and 300 grams of raspberries 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.280
 currently most likely ive 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.050
 The raspberries will fill her up 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.420
 just put it in a big glass 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.979
 preserving jars, for example, of cucumbers 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.229
 or from Schattenmorellen on it goes 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:40.330
 you then the white balsamic to the 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.330
 are covered with it 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.580
 and then you just make lids 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.060
 on it and shake the whole thing 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.930
 bit and makes it to the window in 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.910
 the sun 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.820
 Do you leave it like that for a week or two? 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:07.770
 stand and shakes the once a day 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.600
 so a bit through when the time around 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.550
 you take a sieve and pours that 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.920
 whole from him 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.350
 give her in the trash or whatever 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.690
 always wanted to do with it and the 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.600
 vinegar left over the cook the 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.310
 once on and if you want you can 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.350
 then filter it through by filtration 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.480
 a fitting her towel or kitchen towel 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.850
 so that all the cloudy substances are out 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.310
 and then just fill it in one 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.489
 nice bottle I link you below 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.050
 in the infobox an online shop of 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.270
 have sold beautiful bottles 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.360
 I always imagine whole cartons and 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.070
 that always arrives very well and done 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.989
 is the hit of the acid I do not have 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.910
 said simply two ingredients 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.120
 you can try go wrong 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.650

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.540
 Lettuce and I wish you all 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.080
