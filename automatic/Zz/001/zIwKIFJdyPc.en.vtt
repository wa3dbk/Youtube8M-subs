filter<00:02:11.880> with<00:02:12.090> two<00:02:12.890> apartments<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.040> that

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
filter with two apartments so that

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.030 
filter with two apartments so that
doesn't<00:02:14.490> really<00:02:14.610> drop<00:02:15.000> over<00:02:15.210> that<00:02:15.360> was<00:02:15.480> any

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
doesn't really drop over that was any

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.060 
doesn't really drop over that was any
$20<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.160> think<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:17.930> money<00:02:18.930> really<00:02:19.230> well<00:02:19.470> spent
