00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.760 
complexity of the routine very important
it<00:01:28.039> was<00:01:28.250> so<00:01:28.430> very<00:01:28.579> difficult

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
it was so very difficult

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.160 
it was so very difficult
how's<00:01:30.400> Italy

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:43.580

the important thing to do is to carry on
she's<00:01:46.590> doing
