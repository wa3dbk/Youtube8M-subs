00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
doing instead of actually going to

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:17.159

someone<00:04:12.069> and<00:04:12.129> getting<00:04:12.370> it<00:04:12.459> done<00:04:12.810> um<00:04:14.010> I<00:04:16.079> guess<00:04:17.079> I

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
someone and getting it done um I guess I

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:18.900 
someone and getting it done um I guess I
just<00:04:17.199> don't<00:04:17.470> care<00:04:17.590> about<00:04:17.709> my<00:04:17.859> nails<00:04:18.039> actually

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
my reason for getting gel nails is

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.230 
my reason for getting gel nails is
because<00:04:20.769> my<00:04:21.250> nails<00:04:21.459> were<00:04:21.549> really<00:04:21.849> brittle<00:04:22.090> and

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
because my nails were really brittle and

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.060 
because my nails were really brittle and
I<00:04:22.300> use<00:04:22.450> this<00:04:22.630> strengthener<00:04:23.320> which<00:04:23.770> I<00:04:23.890> like

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
I use this strengthener which I like

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.860 
I use this strengthener which I like
keratin<00:04:24.580> and<00:04:24.700> horsehair<00:04:25.030> extract<00:04:25.599> all<00:04:25.750> that

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
keratin and horsehair extract all that

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.810 
keratin and horsehair extract all that
stuff<00:04:26.080> and<00:04:26.250> it<00:04:27.250> was<00:04:27.400> like

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
stuff and it was like

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.220 
stuff and it was like
but<00:04:27.910> then<00:04:28.030> I<00:04:28.120> didn't<00:04:28.390> use<00:04:28.480> it<00:04:28.510> for<00:04:28.810> a<00:04:28.840> week<00:04:29.020> and

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.230 
the world and when I go to take them off
there's<00:05:26.380> something<00:05:26.680> to<00:05:26.740> be<00:05:26.800> fine<00:05:26.950> and<00:05:27.210> so<00:05:28.210> I

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
there's something to be fine and so I

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.490 
there's something to be fine and so I
read<00:05:28.830> that<00:05:29.830> gel<00:05:30.730> nails<00:05:30.940> are<00:05:31.150> not<00:05:31.300> porous<00:05:31.810> which

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
read that gel nails are not porous which

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.630 
read that gel nails are not porous which
also<00:05:32.710> means<00:05:32.950> they're<00:05:33.130> harder<00:05:33.340> to<00:05:33.370> get<00:05:33.490> off

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
also means they're harder to get off

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.250 
also means they're harder to get off
like<00:05:33.940> apparently<00:05:34.360> acrylics<00:05:34.720> are<00:05:34.840> poor<00:05:35.050> so

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 
like apparently acrylics are poor so

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.100 
like apparently acrylics are poor so
they're<00:05:35.410> really<00:05:35.620> easy<00:05:35.650> to<00:05:35.830> take<00:05:35.920> off<00:05:36.040> but<00:05:36.820> um

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
they're really easy to take off but um

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.990 
they're really easy to take off but um
gels<00:05:38.110> are<00:05:38.320> not<00:05:38.500> porous<00:05:38.920> so<00:05:39.460> apparently<00:05:39.700> that

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
gels are not porous so apparently that

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.370 
gels are not porous so apparently that
means<00:05:40.210> that<00:05:40.360> I<00:05:40.390> can<00:05:40.570> actually<00:05:40.720> pay<00:05:41.050> my<00:05:41.200> nails

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
means that I can actually pay my nails

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.140 
means that I can actually pay my nails
black<00:05:41.740> in<00:05:42.100> that<00:05:42.130> then<00:05:42.490> when<00:05:42.640> I<00:05:42.730> take<00:05:42.940> it<00:05:42.970> off

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
black in that then when I take it off

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.120 
black in that then when I take it off
there<00:05:43.390> won't<00:05:43.540> be<00:05:43.660> any<00:05:43.810> black<00:05:44.110> residue<00:05:44.590> but<00:05:45.070> I

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
there won't be any black residue but I

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.880 
there won't be any black residue but I
am<00:05:45.400> a<00:05:45.430> little<00:05:45.880> iffy<00:05:46.180> about<00:05:46.270> that<00:05:46.590> so<00:05:47.590> I<00:05:47.620> would

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:47.890 
am a little iffy about that so I would

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.290 
am a little iffy about that so I would
definitely<00:05:47.920> recommend<00:05:48.490> putting<00:05:48.910> a<00:05:49.060> clear

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
definitely recommend putting a clear

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.210 
definitely recommend putting a clear
coat<00:05:49.420> on<00:05:49.480> and<00:05:49.600> then<00:05:50.050> covering<00:05:50.680> your<00:05:50.830> nails<00:05:51.040> in

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
coat on and then covering your nails in

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.020 
coat on and then covering your nails in
black<00:05:51.400> um<00:05:51.760> I<00:05:53.340> paint<00:05:54.340> my<00:05:54.400> nails<00:05:54.640> are<00:05:54.940> painted

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
stuff it's very hard I don't know how

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.660 
stuff it's very hard I don't know how
you'd<00:06:14.830> actually<00:06:14.950> do<00:06:15.190> that<00:06:15.310> um<00:06:16.590> yeah<00:06:17.590> so<00:06:17.950> all<00:06:18.490> in

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:18.670 
you'd actually do that um yeah so all in

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.070 
you'd actually do that um yeah so all in
all<00:06:18.760> I<00:06:18.820> would<00:06:18.940> not<00:06:19.180> recommend<00:06:19.270> gel<00:06:19.720> nails<00:06:19.930> just

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
all I would not recommend gel nails just

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.930 
all I would not recommend gel nails just
because<00:06:20.380> of<00:06:20.500> the<00:06:20.590> pain<00:06:20.830> maybe<00:06:21.640> in<00:06:21.820> the<00:06:21.850> end

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
because of the pain maybe in the end

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.240 
because of the pain maybe in the end
I'll<00:06:22.210> be<00:06:22.330> like<00:06:22.450> this<00:06:22.570> was<00:06:22.750> awesome<00:06:23.140> yay<00:06:23.380> but

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250 
I'll be like this was awesome yay but

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.700 
I'll be like this was awesome yay but
right<00:06:24.700> now<00:06:24.850> I'm<00:06:25.170> not<00:06:26.170> really<00:06:26.320> thinking<00:06:26.530> about

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
right now I'm not really thinking about

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.670 
right now I'm not really thinking about
so<00:06:27.640> that's<00:06:28.360> my<00:06:28.600> review<00:06:28.690> of<00:06:28.900> gel<00:06:29.200> nails<00:06:29.440> I'm

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
so that's my review of gel nails I'm

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.170 
so that's my review of gel nails I'm
really<00:06:30.040> really<00:06:30.190> signs<00:06:30.460> of<00:06:30.580> the<00:06:30.640> lighting<00:06:31.000> so

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180 
really really signs of the lighting so

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.140 
really really signs of the lighting so
bad<00:06:31.920> we'll<00:06:32.920> see<00:06:33.100> if<00:06:33.250> I<00:06:33.310> do<00:06:33.370> take<00:06:33.670> them<00:06:33.790> off<00:06:33.940> like

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150 
bad we'll see if I do take them off like

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.200
