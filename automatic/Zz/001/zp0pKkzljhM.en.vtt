00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.540
 13-inch pro the model I have 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.349
 got me 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.209
 it's the basic one because we say that for me 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:16.780
 it's more than fair 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:18.850
 they are 128 gb yes they are a little bit 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.460
 however we still proceed with unboxing 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.730
 I immediately tell you about apple fans 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.260
 you will say no we say that for video and 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.630
 what i do macbook pro is 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.010
 perfect so good without that 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.850
 we analyze the box because it is the 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:49.030
 I would usually say to proceed to open the 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:52.230
 box we immediately find the mac with the 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.230
 tongue to pull it out 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.190
 here he is, we see him better later 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.460
 let 's see what the package can take 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:10.810
 inside the package we find 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:17.659
 power supply with mac safe 2 the extension 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:24.229
 and in short the piece that must be inserted 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:31.220
 here for the power supply we could the 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:32.630
 mammo bed we wrote hello macbook 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.549
 pro 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.830
 the miscellaneous drawing and the cloth for 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:41.959
 clean the screen this month ago 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.990
 saved my macbook many times 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:46.700
 air from many terrible falls in 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.119
 practice magnetic technology that 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.939
 allows in case of crashes I love the fi lan 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.340
 not to drop the computer now 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:58.399
 We raise the guarantee seal 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:16.390
 this would be here at macbook 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:16.390
 you have to pull and here it is 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.200
 let's see how he did it in 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.760
 computer 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:27.670
 I immediately say that it is a very thin 1.8 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:32.080
 mm so it's really a machine at the 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:35.440
 spectacular is the weight is 1 57 kg 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.840
 say another site not imagine a 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.450
 slightly heavier is enough to read 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:46.830
 this one that model 13 instead of so 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:53.370
 15 inches which weighs 2.02 that g 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:57.850
 let us celebrate we find this manettino for 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:00.850
 the screen is not things instead of more 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:07.269
 of this mac or screen anyway a 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:12.220

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:20.200

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.460
 the slot for the sd then only true 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:33.660
 nothing here we find however we are 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:36.620
 the usual ones then I turn it on but it must 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.620
 do initial setup 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.640
 who already sees that I have the telephone yes? 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:51.709
 opened because otherwise it reminded me of nothing 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.209

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.340
