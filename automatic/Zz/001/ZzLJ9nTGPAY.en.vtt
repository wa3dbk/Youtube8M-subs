thought I was completely rid of it
apparently<00:00:37.290> not<00:00:37.410> if<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:38.100> don't<00:00:38.309> know<00:00:38.520> what<00:00:39.180> it

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
apparently not if you don't know what it

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.049 
apparently not if you don't know what it
is<00:00:39.329> basically<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:40.410> when<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.520> lining<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.000> your

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
is basically is when the lining of your

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.229 
is basically is when the lining of your
stomach<00:00:42.120> gets<00:00:42.780> inflamed<00:00:43.290> or<00:00:43.590> swollen<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.370> it

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
stomach gets inflamed or swollen and it

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.180 
stomach gets inflamed or swollen and it
produces<00:00:45.780> like<00:00:46.440> what<00:00:46.649> could<00:00:46.829> be<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> whole

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
produces like what could be a whole

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.709 
produces like what could be a whole
bunch<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.520> different<00:00:47.760> reasons<00:00:48.300> why<00:00:48.539> it

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
bunch of different reasons why it

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.410 
bunch of different reasons why it
happened<00:00:49.230> but<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.770> think<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.820> reason<00:00:51.000> mine

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
happened but I think the reason mine

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.979 
happened but I think the reason mine
happen<00:00:51.899> or<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.469> attack<00:00:52.980> happened<00:00:53.610> um<00:00:54.449> was

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
happen or this attack happened um was

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.260 
happen or this attack happened um was
probably<00:00:55.289> because<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.829> stress<00:00:56.399> who<00:00:56.940> thinks

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
probably because of stress who thinks

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.520 
probably because of stress who thinks
that<00:00:57.329> would<00:00:57.510> be<00:00:57.629> stressed<00:00:57.960> i<00:00:58.140> would<00:00:58.289> i<00:00:58.379> be

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
that would be stressed i would i be

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.810 
that would be stressed i would i be
stressed<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.129> don't<00:00:59.160> know<00:00:59.309> anything<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> mid

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
stressed I don't know anything the mid

stairs to bail or it was food that I ate
it<00:01:02.760> seems<00:01:03.300> like<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.480> was<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.690> combination<00:01:04.110> of

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
it seems like it was a combination of

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640 
bandwagon I think the only one who

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.150 
bandwagon I think the only one who
actually<00:06:27.790> did<00:06:28.210> this<00:06:28.530> was<00:06:29.530> marathi<00:06:30.480> but

I<00:06:32.250> don't<00:06:32.490> know<00:06:32.550> I<00:06:32.640> think<00:06:32.700> I<00:06:32.880> told<00:06:33.090> her<00:06:33.180> to

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.270 
I don't know I think I told her to
forget<00:06:34.110> about<00:06:34.410> it<00:06:34.650> this<00:06:34.770> week<00:06:34.980> and<00:06:35.100> we'll<00:06:35.190> do

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
forget about it this week and we'll do

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.850 
forget about it this week and we'll do
it<00:06:35.370> next<00:06:35.460> week<00:06:35.670> or<00:06:35.760> something<00:06:36.500> so<00:06:37.500> maybe<00:06:37.740> we

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
it next week or something so maybe we

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.390 
it next week or something so maybe we
look<00:06:38.010> out<00:06:38.190> for<00:06:38.610> the<00:06:39.060> fun<00:06:39.420> weekly<00:06:39.990> weigh-in
