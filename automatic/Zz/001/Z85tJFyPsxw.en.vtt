really nice hilt the the power button is
right<00:01:08.850> here<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.420> instead<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.750> actually<00:01:10.110> like

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
right here and instead of actually like

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.140 
right here and instead of actually like
the<00:01:10.409> other<00:01:10.530> force<00:01:11.100> FX<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.520> having<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.850> push<00:01:12.000> it

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
the other force FX is having to push it

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.609 
the other force FX is having to push it
up<00:01:12.270> or<00:01:12.479> pull<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.720> back<00:01:12.960> down<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.290> turn<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.530> on

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
up or pull it back down to turn it on

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.640 
up or pull it back down to turn it on
it's<00:01:14.340> actually<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.640> twist<00:01:14.909> knob<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.990> if<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.320> spin

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
it's actually a twist knob so if I spin

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.649 
it's actually a twist knob so if I spin
my<00:01:16.680> camera<00:01:17.100> like<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.280> you'll<00:01:18.210> see<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.540> I

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
my camera like that you'll see that I

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.160 
my camera like that you'll see that I
turn<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.880> and<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.030> blade<00:01:21.240> lights<00:01:21.509> up<00:01:21.750> and

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
turn it and the blade lights up and

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.760 
turn it and the blade lights up and
again<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.650> hear<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.920> sounds<00:01:23.400> as<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.990> motion

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
again you hear the sounds as the motion

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.749 
again you hear the sounds as the motion
sounds<00:01:26.990> basically<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.829> battle<00:01:29.130> crashes<00:01:29.610> that

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
sounds basically the battle crashes that

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.210 
sounds basically the battle crashes that
we've<00:01:29.909> come<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.329> love<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.780> then<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.860> turn<00:01:32.189> it

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
we've come to love and then I turn it

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.100 
we've come to love and then I turn it
back<00:01:33.619> and<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.740> turns<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.100> off<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.820> both<00:01:36.780> are

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
back and it turns it off so both are

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.190 
back and it turns it off so both are
exactly<00:01:37.380> identical<00:01:38.119> this<00:01:39.119> one<00:01:39.360> here<00:01:39.630> as<00:01:39.900> you

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.020 

and<00:01:49.620> again<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.100> one<00:01:50.310> has<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:52.790> jewel<00:01:53.790> down

what<00:02:05.400> I've<00:02:05.520> started<00:02:05.730> to<00:02:05.940> do<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.060> thought<00:02:06.300> I

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
what I've started to do I thought I

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.730 
what I've started to do I thought I
might<00:02:06.510> work<00:02:06.690> backwards<00:02:07.170> rather<00:02:07.350> than<00:02:07.560> work

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
might work backwards rather than work

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.040 
might work backwards rather than work
forwards<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.460> is<00:02:08.580> just<00:02:08.790> myself<00:02:08.970> here<00:02:09.390> you

forwards this is just myself here you
can<00:02:10.200> see<00:02:10.350> there<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.680> the<00:02:10.950> entire<00:02:11.610> lightsaber

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
can see there is the entire lightsaber

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.960 
can see there is the entire lightsaber
well<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.900> dual<00:02:13.080> lightsaber<00:02:13.530> joined<00:02:13.800> together

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
well the dual lightsaber joined together

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:22.090 
well the dual lightsaber joined together
I'll<00:02:19.370> move<00:02:20.370> back<00:02:20.400> so<00:02:20.760> you<00:02:20.850> can<00:02:20.970> get<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.090> big<00:02:21.300> look

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
I'll move back so you can get a big look

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.290 
I'll move back so you can get a big look
there<00:02:23.100> it<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.280> there<00:02:23.430> it's<00:02:23.580> about<00:02:23.670> over<00:02:24.030> seven

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
there it is there it's about over seven

there it is there it's about over seven
feet<00:02:24.510> long<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:26.730> I'm<00:02:26.850> pretty<00:02:27.030> sure<00:02:27.240> at

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
feet long and I'm pretty sure at

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.700 
feet long and I'm pretty sure at
nighttime<00:02:27.750> this<00:02:27.900> one's<00:02:28.140> going<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.350> look<00:02:28.500> an

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
nighttime this one's going to look an

nighttime this one's going to look an
absolute<00:02:29.310> treat<00:02:30.170> as<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.320> can<00:02:31.410> see<00:02:31.590> it<00:02:31.680> comes

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
absolute treat as you can see it comes

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.240 
absolute treat as you can see it comes
with<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.130> display<00:02:32.460> stands<00:02:33.950> but<00:02:34.950> the

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
with the display stands but the

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.700 
with the display stands but the
interesting<00:02:35.550> part<00:02:35.760> is<00:02:36.060> I'll<00:02:36.450> turn<00:02:36.600> it<00:02:36.720> off<00:02:36.810> to

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
interesting part is I'll turn it off to

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.610 
interesting part is I'll turn it off to
show<00:02:37.890> you<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.340> how<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:39.170> turn<00:02:40.170> them<00:02:40.350> apart

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
show you is how to turn them apart

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.260 
show you is how to turn them apart
they're<00:02:40.830> in<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.010> center<00:02:41.190> here<00:02:41.490> this<00:02:41.970> is<00:02:42.090> our

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
they're in the center here this is our

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.430 
they're in the center here this is our
connector<00:02:42.660> piece<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:43.020> I<00:02:43.080> showed<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.320> before

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
connector piece that I showed you before

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.520 
connector piece that I showed you before
here<00:02:44.340> are<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.520> two<00:02:44.670> end<00:02:44.880> pieces<00:02:45.230> they<00:02:46.230> both

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
here are the two end pieces they both

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.030 
here are the two end pieces they both
get<00:02:46.770> unscrewed<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:48.090> allow<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:49.140> join<00:02:49.830> it<00:02:49.950> up

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
get unscrewed to allow you to join it up

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.960 
get unscrewed to allow you to join it up
now<00:02:50.670> basically<00:02:51.000> what<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:51.270> do<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:52.290> remove<00:02:53.190> the

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
now basically what you do to remove the

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.310 
now basically what you do to remove the
pieces<00:02:54.470> I'll<00:02:55.470> have<00:02:55.739> to<00:02:56.870> try<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:57.930> hold<00:02:58.110> my

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
pieces I'll have to try and hold my

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:04.580 
pieces I'll have to try and hold my
camera<00:02:58.500> up<00:02:58.739> for<00:02:59.330> is<00:03:00.590> we<00:03:01.670> twist<00:03:02.989> or<00:03:03.989> you<00:03:04.110> rotate

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
camera up for is we twist or you rotate

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.090 
camera up for is we twist or you rotate
to<00:03:04.980> unscrew<00:03:05.489> them<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.820> basically<00:03:07.100> hopefully

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
to unscrew them and basically hopefully

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:16.230 
to unscrew them and basically hopefully
I<00:03:09.260> can

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.840 

so<00:03:17.240> I<00:03:17.270> can<00:03:17.540> show<00:03:17.750> you<00:03:18.670> so<00:03:19.670> here<00:03:19.820> we<00:03:19.910> get<00:03:20.030> that

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
so I can show you so here we get that

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
do is I just untwist the lightsaber and

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:43.560 
do is I just untwist the lightsaber and
off<00:03:35.120> comes<00:03:35.300> that<00:03:35.540> piece<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:36.530> then<00:03:38.680> I'm<00:03:39.680> twist

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.230 

that<00:03:44.570> piece<00:03:44.870> and<00:03:45.650> there<00:03:46.370> is<00:03:46.490> the<00:03:46.640> connector<00:03:47.060> so

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.240 
that piece and there is the connector so

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.900 
that piece and there is the connector so
we<00:03:47.360> have<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.630> two<00:03:47.810> and<00:03:48.050> then<00:03:48.890> you<00:03:49.220> just<00:03:49.700> take

screw it back on and you're left with
your<00:04:13.310> two<00:04:13.520> lightsabers<00:04:13.970> now<00:04:14.270> you're<00:04:14.390> probably

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
your two lightsabers now you're probably

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.180 
your two lightsabers now you're probably
wondering<00:04:14.690> why<00:04:15.110> there's<00:04:15.320> an<00:04:15.410> allen<00:04:15.710> key<00:04:15.920> the

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
wondering why there's an allen key the

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.990 
wondering why there's an allen key the
allen<00:04:17.150> key<00:04:17.359> here<00:04:18.010> is<00:04:19.010> if<00:04:19.220> I<00:04:19.340> hold<00:04:19.519> it<00:04:19.670> up<00:04:19.730> you

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
allen key here is if I hold it up you

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.729 
allen key here is if I hold it up you
can<00:04:20.420> see<00:04:20.570> there's<00:04:20.690> a<00:04:20.810> bolt<00:04:21.080> inside<00:04:21.530> your

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
can see there's a bolt inside your

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.950 
can see there's a bolt inside your
adapter<00:04:22.220> now<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:22.640> bolt<00:04:22.940> actually<00:04:23.330> allows<00:04:23.630> you

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
adapter now the bolt actually allows you

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.870 
adapter now the bolt actually allows you
to<00:04:26.650> unscrew<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:27.680> two<00:04:28.310> pieces<00:04:28.610> that<00:04:28.730> are

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
to unscrew the two pieces that are

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.000 
to unscrew the two pieces that are
connected<00:04:29.390> and<00:04:29.600> move<00:04:30.290> them<00:04:30.500> around<00:04:30.620> so<00:04:30.890> that

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
connected and move them around so that

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.350 
connected and move them around so that
when<00:04:31.220> you<00:04:31.660> line<00:04:32.660> up<00:04:32.690> your<00:04:33.340> lightsaber<00:04:34.340> you<00:04:35.180> end

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
when you line up your lightsaber you end

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.490 
when you line up your lightsaber you end
up<00:04:35.570> with<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:36.440> four<00:04:36.680> buttons<00:04:37.070> in<00:04:37.850> a<00:04:37.970> row<00:04:38.500> so

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
up with the four buttons in a row so
