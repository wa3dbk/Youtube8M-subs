so what I'm doing now I'm in bridge most
of<00:00:16.020> my<00:00:16.170> workflow<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:16.710> start<00:00:17.250> out<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:17.430> import

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.790 
of my workflow I start out I import
through<00:00:18.270> bridge<00:00:18.540> I<00:00:18.810> go<00:00:18.990> directly<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.590> camera

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
through bridge I go directly to camera

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.939 
through bridge I go directly to camera
raw<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.490> then<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.480> do<00:00:21.750> some<00:00:22.230> tweaking<00:00:22.410> through

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
raw and then I do some tweaking through

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.000 
raw and then I do some tweaking through
Lightroom<00:00:23.779> mostly<00:00:24.779> through<00:00:24.960> Photoshop<00:00:25.529> but<00:00:25.949> I

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010

that you now have the ability to process

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.770 
that you now have the ability to process
multiple<00:01:51.660> images<00:01:52.619> using<00:01:53.580> that<00:01:53.910> profile<00:01:54.450> at

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
ahead of myself some of these have not

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.390 
ahead of myself some of these have not
been<00:02:19.760> touched<00:02:20.210> at<00:02:20.450> all<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:20.930> so<00:02:21.110> there

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
been touched at all and so there

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.010 
been touched at all and so there
especially<00:02:22.400> this<00:02:22.760> first<00:02:22.970> one<00:02:23.240> a<00:02:23.300> bit<00:02:23.660> on<00:02:23.870> the

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
especially this first one a bit on the

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.400 
especially this first one a bit on the
overexposed<00:02:25.360> but<00:02:26.360> this<00:02:26.540> is<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:26.900> image<00:02:27.050> we're

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
overexposed but this is the image we're

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.230 
overexposed but this is the image we're
going<00:02:27.530> to<00:02:27.590> go<00:02:27.740> back<00:02:27.770> to<00:02:28.010> this<00:02:28.580> is<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:28.880> one<00:02:29.060> that

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
going to go back to this is the one that

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.230 
going to go back to this is the one that
we<00:02:29.360> were<00:02:29.510> originally<00:02:30.050> looking<00:02:30.080> at<00:02:31.240> we're

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
we were originally looking at we're

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.060 
we were originally looking at we're
going<00:02:32.360> to<00:02:32.420> go<00:02:32.510> back<00:02:32.540> over<00:02:33.260> here<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.160> select

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
going to go back over here and select

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.660 
going to go back over here and select
studio<00:02:37.070> tungsten<00:02:37.790> Cannon<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:39.610> apply<00:02:40.610> the

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
studio tungsten Cannon and apply the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.830 
studio tungsten Cannon and apply the
camera<00:02:41.270> profile<00:02:42.430> now<00:02:43.430> that<00:02:44.060> looks<00:02:44.300> really

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
camera profile now that looks really

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.320 
camera profile now that looks really
good<00:02:45.380> but<00:02:45.770> we've<00:02:46.520> got<00:02:46.700> all<00:02:46.880> these<00:02:47.030> other

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
good but we've got all these other

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.350 
good but we've got all these other
images<00:02:47.900> open<00:02:48.080> here<00:02:48.470> as<00:02:48.590> well<00:02:48.970> let<00:02:49.970> me<00:02:50.120> show<00:02:50.330> you

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
images open here as well let me show you

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.750 
images open here as well let me show you
just<00:02:50.840> how<00:02:50.990> simple<00:02:51.350> it<00:02:51.560> is<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.710> apply<00:02:52.190> this<00:02:52.310> to

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
just how simple it is to apply this to

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.260 
just how simple it is to apply this to
multiple<00:02:53.240> images<00:02:53.750> now<00:02:54.740> we're<00:02:54.950> going<00:02:55.070> to

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
multiple images now we're going to

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.790 
multiple images now we're going to
leaving<00:02:56.270> the<00:02:56.300> original<00:02:56.660> one<00:02:57.080> open<00:02:57.500> that<00:02:57.650> we

leaving the original one open that we

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.340 
leaving the original one open that we
have<00:02:58.040> now<00:02:58.250> just<00:02:58.790> added<00:02:59.240> the<00:02:59.420> calibration<00:03:00.110> to

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
have now just added the calibration to

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.270 
have now just added the calibration to

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
camera calibration has been applied all

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.900 
camera calibration has been applied all
the<00:03:39.140> way<00:03:39.260> across<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.800> board<00:03:40.250> on<00:03:40.400> all<00:03:40.610> of<00:03:40.790> these

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
the way across the board on all of these

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.900 
the way across the board on all of these
images<00:03:41.420> and<00:03:41.720> it<00:03:42.290> was<00:03:42.410> all<00:03:42.680> done<00:03:43.040> simply<00:03:43.760> with

one click that's how easy it is to use

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.410 
one click that's how easy it is to use
the<00:03:48.050> colorchecker<00:03:48.980> software<00:03:49.910> and<00:03:50.150> apply<00:03:50.390> it

the colorchecker software and apply it

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.199 
the colorchecker software and apply it
to<00:03:50.660> multiple<00:03:51.050> images<00:03:51.820> so<00:03:52.820> we're<00:03:52.970> going<00:03:53.060> to<00:03:53.150> go

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
to multiple images so we're going to go

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.880 
to multiple images so we're going to go
ahead<00:03:53.300> and<00:03:53.690> we're<00:03:53.780> going<00:03:53.810> to<00:03:53.930> cancel<00:03:54.320> out<00:03:54.739> of

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
ahead and we're going to cancel out of

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:01.390 
ahead and we're going to cancel out of
here<00:03:55.310> and<00:03:55.989> now<00:03:56.989> let's<00:03:57.769> go<00:03:58.010> back<00:03:58.610> and<00:04:00.400> reopen

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
here and now let's go back and reopen

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.330 
here and now let's go back and reopen
that<00:04:01.580> up<00:04:02.230> so<00:04:03.230> we're<00:04:03.410> going<00:04:03.500> to<00:04:03.590> open<00:04:03.769> it<00:04:04.100> back

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
that up so we're going to open it back

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.430 
that up so we're going to open it back
up<00:04:04.400> in<00:04:04.880> Camera<00:04:05.300> Raw<00:04:05.450> once<00:04:05.750> again

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440

we're<00:04:10.440> going<00:04:10.590> to<00:04:10.650> go<00:04:10.830> back<00:04:11.430> down<00:04:11.820> to<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.330> image

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
we're going to go back down to the image

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.990 
we're going to go back down to the image
that<00:04:12.750> we<00:04:13.140> were<00:04:13.260> originally<00:04:13.860> working<00:04:14.070> with<00:04:15.860> and

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.460 
great results that i was seeing when i
used<00:04:43.950> the<00:04:44.250> original<00:04:44.880> profile<00:04:45.420> shot<00:04:45.840> only<00:04:46.080> in

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
used the original profile shot only in

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.340 
used the original profile shot only in
these<00:04:46.650> lighting<00:04:47.010> conditions<00:04:47.660> the<00:04:48.660> reason<00:04:49.170> for

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
these lighting conditions the reason for

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.470 
these lighting conditions the reason for
that<00:04:49.380> is<00:04:49.650> that<00:04:49.680> dual<00:04:50.190> aluminum<00:04:50.730> profile<00:04:51.210> has

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
that is that dual aluminum profile has

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.350 
that is that dual aluminum profile has
the<00:04:51.720> ability<00:04:52.170> to<00:04:52.440> take<00:04:53.220> all<00:04:53.460> that<00:04:53.670> data<00:04:53.970> and

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
the ability to take all that data and

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.460 
the ability to take all that data and
see<00:04:55.110> where<00:04:55.500> that<00:04:55.740> shift<00:04:56.100> needs<00:04:56.310> to<00:04:56.490> take<00:04:56.700> place

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
see where that shift needs to take place

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.650 
see where that shift needs to take place
so<00:04:58.470> now<00:04:58.650> once<00:04:59.010> again<00:04:59.270> we're<00:05:00.270> going<00:05:00.390> to<00:05:00.480> go

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
so now once again we're going to go

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:07.700 
so now once again we're going to go
ahead<00:05:00.690> and<00:05:03.350> select<00:05:04.350> all<00:05:06.140> click<00:05:07.140> on<00:05:07.440> our

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
ahead and select all click on our

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.270 
ahead and select all click on our
synchronize<00:05:08.340> option<00:05:08.640> and<00:05:09.590> as<00:05:10.590> we<00:05:10.860> left<00:05:11.130> the

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
synchronize option and as we left the

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.070 
synchronize option and as we left the
setting<00:05:11.730> before<00:05:11.880> the<00:05:12.120> only<00:05:12.690> thing<00:05:12.930> that's

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
setting before the only thing that's

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.570 
setting before the only thing that's
going<00:05:13.230> to<00:05:13.290> be<00:05:13.440> chosen<00:05:13.740> is<00:05:14.100> going<00:05:14.280> to<00:05:14.340> be<00:05:14.460> the

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
going to be chosen is going to be the

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.150 
going to be chosen is going to be the
camera<00:05:14.970> calibration<00:05:16.100> simply<00:05:17.100> click<00:05:17.280> OK<00:05:17.850> and

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
camera calibration simply click OK and

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.100 
camera calibration simply click OK and
once<00:05:20.160> again<00:05:20.370> we're<00:05:21.030> seeing<00:05:21.360> that<00:05:21.600> the<00:05:21.810> little

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
once again we're seeing that the little

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.890 
once again we're seeing that the little
icon<00:05:22.560> is<00:05:22.710> showing<00:05:23.130> that<00:05:23.160> every<00:05:23.730> image<00:05:24.300> has<00:05:24.600> now

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
icon is showing that every image has now

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.980 
icon is showing that every image has now
been<00:05:25.200> converted<00:05:25.530> over<00:05:26.010> to<00:05:26.300> use<00:05:27.300> the<00:05:27.690> new

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
been converted over to use the new

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:34.950 
been converted over to use the new
camera<00:05:28.710> calibration<00:05:31.040> awesome<00:05:32.040> color

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.409 

that<00:05:35.590> was<00:05:35.770> before<00:05:35.949> and<00:05:37.289> that's<00:05:38.289> after<00:05:39.419> just

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 
that was before and that's after just

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:43.200 
that was before and that's after just
enough<00:05:40.720> to<00:05:40.900> give<00:05:41.020> us<00:05:41.050> a<00:05:41.229> nice<00:05:41.440> rich<00:05:42.190> color<00:05:42.550> and

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
enough to give us a nice rich color and

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.140 
enough to give us a nice rich color and
deep<00:05:43.539> saturation<00:05:44.229> so<00:05:45.220> that<00:05:45.430> you<00:05:45.580> can<00:05:45.759> see

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
deep saturation so that you can see

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.629 
deep saturation so that you can see
exactly<00:05:46.750> what<00:05:47.229> that<00:05:47.440> profile<00:05:47.949> is<00:05:48.130> doing<00:05:48.430> for

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639 
exactly what that profile is doing for

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:55.760 
exactly what that profile is doing for
you<00:05:49.080> once<00:05:50.080> again<00:05:50.380> before<00:05:50.620> and<00:05:52.139> after<00:05:54.120> and

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
you once again before and after and

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.730 
you once again before and after and
that's<00:05:56.770> how<00:05:56.979> easy<00:05:57.220> it<00:05:57.430> is<00:05:57.520> to<00:05:57.580> apply<00:05:58.000> this

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
that's how easy it is to apply this

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.419 
that's how easy it is to apply this
across<00:05:59.740> the<00:05:59.979> board<00:06:00.190> to<00:06:00.400> multiple<00:06:00.970> images
