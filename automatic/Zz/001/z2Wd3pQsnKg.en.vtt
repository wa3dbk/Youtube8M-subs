00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.800 

so<00:00:04.770> we're<00:00:04.950> talking<00:00:05.100> about<00:00:05.400> anemia<00:00:06.000> and<00:00:06.359> as<00:00:06.629> you

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
so we're talking about anemia and as you

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.750 
so we're talking about anemia and as you
can<00:00:06.990> see<00:00:07.230> we've<00:00:07.440> got<00:00:07.470> quite<00:00:07.740> a<00:00:08.189> few<00:00:08.429> different

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
can see we've got quite a few different

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.110 
can see we've got quite a few different
types<00:00:08.820> of<00:00:09.179> anemia<00:00:09.660> here<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.670> this<00:00:11.670> really

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
types of anemia here and this really

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.390 
types of anemia here and this really
isn't<00:00:12.269> even<00:00:12.480> half<00:00:12.900> of<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.230> there's<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.980> lot<00:00:14.219> more

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
isn't even half of it there's a lot more

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.919 
isn't even half of it there's a lot more
types<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.820> anemia<00:00:15.269> but<00:00:15.389> these<00:00:15.570> are<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.780> most

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
types of anemia but these are the most

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.120 
types of anemia but these are the most
important<00:00:16.500> conditions<00:00:17.390> so<00:00:18.390> anemia<00:00:19.170> basically

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
important conditions so anemia basically

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.580 
important conditions so anemia basically
just<00:00:20.310> means<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:21.210> have<00:00:21.539> either<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.230> low

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
just means that you have either a low

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.120 
just means that you have either a low
number<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.150> red<00:00:24.150> blood<00:00:24.390> cells<00:00:24.660> or<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.560> low

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
number of red blood cells or a low

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.660 
number of red blood cells or a low
amount<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:27.090> hemoglobin<00:00:27.810> in<00:00:27.960> your<00:00:27.990> blood<00:00:28.670> so

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
amount of hemoglobin in your blood so

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.610 
amount of hemoglobin in your blood so
the<00:00:30.060> three<00:00:30.300> major<00:00:30.480> types<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:31.430> anemia<00:00:32.430> include

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
the three major types of anemia include

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.670 
the three major types of anemia include
microcytic<00:00:34.640> macrocytic<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.059> normal<00:00:36.899> normal

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
microcytic macrocytic and normal normal

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.549 
microcytic macrocytic and normal normal
siddik<00:00:38.010> anemia

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
siddik anemia

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.970 
siddik anemia
now<00:00:40.559> those<00:00:40.800> those<00:00:41.610> different<00:00:42.000> types<00:00:42.329> are

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
now those those different types are

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.950 
now those those different types are
referring<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.730> average<00:00:45.149> size<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.840> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
referring to the average size of the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.930 
referring to the average size of the
cell<00:00:46.230> measured<00:00:46.800> by<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.010> mean<00:00:47.640> corpuscular

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
cell measured by the mean corpuscular

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.970 
cell measured by the mean corpuscular
volume<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:49.200> MCB<00:00:50.059> so<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.840> normal<00:00:52.680> red<00:00:52.949> blood

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
volume the MCB so the normal red blood

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.139 
volume the MCB so the normal red blood
cell<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.670> between<00:00:54.120> 80<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:56.899> 100<00:00:58.370> on<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.699> MCV

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
cell is between 80 and 100 on the MCV

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.290 
cell is between 80 and 100 on the MCV
and<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.739> anything<00:01:02.070> smaller<00:01:02.699> than<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.090> would

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
and so anything smaller than that would

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.479 
and so anything smaller than that would
be<00:01:03.420> microcytic<00:01:04.049> anything<00:01:04.769> bigger<00:01:05.100> than<00:01:05.129> that

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
be microcytic anything bigger than that

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.740 
be microcytic anything bigger than that
would<00:01:05.790> be<00:01:05.909> macrocytic<00:01:07.460> so<00:01:08.460> let's<00:01:09.299> start<00:01:09.570> with

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
would be macrocytic so let's start with

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.429 
would be macrocytic so let's start with
the<00:01:10.409> microcytic<00:01:10.979> anemias<00:01:12.140> why<00:01:13.140> would<00:01:13.320> you

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
the microcytic anemias why would you

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.440 
the microcytic anemias why would you
have<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.650> small<00:01:14.479> red<00:01:15.479> blood<00:01:15.750> cell<00:01:16.400> well<00:01:17.450> usually

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
have a small red blood cell well usually

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.550 
have a small red blood cell well usually
it<00:01:18.780> involves<00:01:20.330> making<00:01:21.330> new<00:01:21.750> red<00:01:21.990> blood<00:01:22.170> cells

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
it involves making new red blood cells

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.770 
it involves making new red blood cells
and<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.580> lot<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.880> these<00:01:23.970> different<00:01:24.390> enemies

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
and a lot of these different enemies

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.510 
and a lot of these different enemies
have<00:01:25.049> have<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.500> do<00:01:25.619> with<00:01:25.770> dysfunctional

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
have have to do with dysfunctional

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.109 
have have to do with dysfunctional
production<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.630> red<00:01:27.930> blood<00:01:27.960> cells<00:01:28.850> but<00:01:30.799> the

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
production of red blood cells but the

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.590 
production of red blood cells but the
first<00:01:33.119> one<00:01:33.270> here<00:01:33.540> iron<00:01:33.900> deficiency<00:01:34.650> anemia<00:01:35.600> it

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
first one here iron deficiency anemia it

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.550 
first one here iron deficiency anemia it
said<00:01:37.079> it's<00:01:38.150> because<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> lack<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.170> iron

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
said it's because of a lack of iron

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.499 
said it's because of a lack of iron
which<00:01:40.890> could<00:01:41.280> be<00:01:41.400> for<00:01:41.640> many<00:01:41.790> reasons<00:01:42.240> whether

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
which could be for many reasons whether

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.359 
which could be for many reasons whether
you're<00:01:42.840> not<00:01:42.960> getting<00:01:43.320> enough<00:01:43.500> iron<00:01:43.680> in<00:01:44.070> or

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
you're not getting enough iron in or

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.730 
you're not getting enough iron in or
you're<00:01:45.119> losing<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.630> lot<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.840> iron<00:01:46.259> due<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.710> a

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
you're losing a lot of iron due to a

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:54.560 
you're losing a lot of iron due to a
chronic<00:01:47.070> bleeding<00:01:48.920> or<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:50.750> you<00:01:52.549> are<00:01:53.549> just<00:01:53.880> not

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
chronic bleeding or a you are just not

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:15.430 
chronic bleeding or a you are just not
able<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.930> make<00:01:57.079> enough<00:01:59.899> credit

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.540 

so<00:02:16.440> there's<00:02:16.620> only<00:02:16.709> two<00:02:16.980> reasons<00:02:17.160> why<00:02:17.400> you

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
so there's only two reasons why you

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.270 
so there's only two reasons why you
wouldn't<00:02:17.819> have<00:02:18.120> enough<00:02:18.390> iron<00:02:18.920> one<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:20.040> them<00:02:20.160> is

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
wouldn't have enough iron one of them is

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.430 
wouldn't have enough iron one of them is
that<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.850> not<00:02:21.000> get<00:02:21.180> enough<00:02:21.510> in<00:02:21.690> your<00:02:21.840> diet<00:02:22.050> or

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
that you not get enough in your diet or

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.070 
that you not get enough in your diet or
you're<00:02:22.860> losing<00:02:23.280> too<00:02:23.430> much<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:23.940> this<00:02:24.630> happens<00:02:25.020> a

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
you're losing too much so this happens a

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.410 
you're losing too much so this happens a
lot<00:02:25.110> with<00:02:25.410> older<00:02:25.440> people<00:02:26.130> that<00:02:26.790> aren't<00:02:27.209> eating

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
lot with older people that aren't eating

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.680 
lot with older people that aren't eating
well<00:02:27.780> or<00:02:28.020> it<00:02:29.010> happens<00:02:29.489> with<00:02:29.850> that<00:02:30.180> people<00:02:30.569> who

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
well or it happens with that people who

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.270 
well or it happens with that people who
are<00:02:30.810> bleeding<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.350> lot<00:02:31.560> you<00:02:31.770> know<00:02:31.860> if<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.100> have

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
are bleeding a lot you know if you have

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.410 
are bleeding a lot you know if you have
a<00:02:32.360> heavy<00:02:33.360> menstrual<00:02:33.959> period<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.940> or<00:02:35.940> if

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
a heavy menstrual period and or if

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.449 
a heavy menstrual period and or if
you're<00:02:36.630> just<00:02:36.900> using<00:02:37.350> too<00:02:37.709> much<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.250> like

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
you're just using too much of it like

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.280 
you're just using too much of it like
during<00:02:39.030> pregnancy<00:02:39.570> you're<00:02:39.780> using<00:02:39.959> a<00:02:40.110> lot<00:02:40.260> of

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
during pregnancy you're using a lot of

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.280 
during pregnancy you're using a lot of
iron<00:02:40.560> that<00:02:41.340> can<00:02:41.550> lead<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.730> iron<00:02:42.150> deficiency

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
iron that can lead to iron deficiency

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.550 
iron that can lead to iron deficiency
anemia<00:02:43.580> so<00:02:44.580> if<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.269> have<00:02:45.390> low<00:02:45.660> iron<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:46.320> course

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
anemia so if you have low iron of course

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.009 
anemia so if you have low iron of course
you're<00:02:46.980> not<00:02:47.130> going<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.430> make<00:02:47.580> as<00:02:47.760> much<00:02:47.910> heme<00:02:48.269> so

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
you're not going to make as much heme so

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.259 
you're not going to make as much heme so
if<00:02:49.590> you're<00:02:49.800> not<00:02:49.920> making<00:02:50.250> as<00:02:50.340> much<00:02:50.519> heme<00:02:50.940> and

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
if you're not making as much heme and

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.180 
if you're not making as much heme and
you<00:02:51.780> end<00:02:51.959> up<00:02:52.110> with<00:02:52.519> smaller<00:02:54.860> smaller<00:02:55.860> red

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
you end up with smaller smaller red

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.580 
you end up with smaller smaller red
blood<00:02:56.400> cells<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:57.600> smaller<00:02:58.019> amount<00:02:58.380> of<00:02:58.470> red

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
blood cells and a smaller amount of red

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.309 
blood cells and a smaller amount of red
blood<00:02:58.800> cells<00:02:58.860> as<00:02:59.280> well<00:02:59.810> so<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.959> other<00:03:01.080> thing

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
blood cells as well so the other thing

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.500 
blood cells as well so the other thing
that<00:03:01.350> you<00:03:01.620> often<00:03:02.280> see<00:03:02.910> with<00:03:03.120> iron<00:03:03.450> deficiency

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
that you often see with iron deficiency

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.600 
that you often see with iron deficiency
anemia<00:03:04.500> is<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:05.819> Plumber<00:03:06.180> Bentsen<00:03:06.720> syndrome

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
anemia is the Plumber Bentsen syndrome

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.039 
anemia is the Plumber Bentsen syndrome
which<00:03:08.900> involves<00:03:09.900> esophageal<00:03:10.530> webs<00:03:10.890> and

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
which involves esophageal webs and

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:17.030 
which involves esophageal webs and
atrophic<00:03:13.049> glossitis<00:03:14.060> so<00:03:15.709> you<00:03:16.709> see<00:03:16.890> those

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
atrophic glossitis so you see those

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.650 
atrophic glossitis so you see those
three<00:03:17.310> things<00:03:17.489> together<00:03:17.760> that<00:03:18.180> an<00:03:18.329> iron

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
three things together that an iron

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.620 
three things together that an iron
deficiency<00:03:18.780> anemia<00:03:19.620> esophageal<00:03:20.579> whips<00:03:20.910> web

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
deficiency anemia esophageal whips web

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.330 
deficiency anemia esophageal whips web
and<00:03:21.959> a<00:03:22.799> trophic<00:03:23.340> glossitis<00:03:25.070> then<00:03:26.070> that

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
and a trophic glossitis then that

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.860 
and a trophic glossitis then that
alpha-thalassemia<00:03:28.340> is<00:03:29.340> caused<00:03:29.730> by<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.450> defect

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
alpha-thalassemia is caused by a defect

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.590 
alpha-thalassemia is caused by a defect
in<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.530> alpha<00:03:31.920> globin<00:03:32.130> gene<00:03:33.140> so<00:03:34.190> if<00:03:35.190> you<00:03:36.150> if

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
in the alpha globin gene so if you if

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.090 
in the alpha globin gene so if you if
you<00:03:36.690> have<00:03:36.950> less<00:03:37.950> alpha<00:03:38.579> globin<00:03:38.810> synthesis

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
you have less alpha globin synthesis

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.729 
you have less alpha globin synthesis
again<00:03:41.100> we're<00:03:41.400> going<00:03:41.519> to<00:03:41.579> have<00:03:41.790> a<00:03:42.440> less<00:03:43.440> stuff

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
again we're going to have a less stuff

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.890 
again we're going to have a less stuff
to<00:03:43.890> make<00:03:44.070> red<00:03:44.280> blood<00:03:44.489> cells<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.060> same<00:03:45.720> with

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
to make red blood cells and same with

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.099 
to make red blood cells and same with
the<00:03:46.049> beta<00:03:46.500> thalassemia<00:03:46.769> beneath<00:03:47.579> it<00:03:47.760> so<00:03:49.730> the

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
the beta thalassemia beneath it so the

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:54.490 
the beta thalassemia beneath it so the
there's<00:03:52.109> a<00:03:52.230> few<00:03:52.440> different<00:03:52.739> categories<00:03:52.920> of

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
there's a few different categories of

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.830 
there's a few different categories of
alpha-thalassemia<00:03:57.109> one<00:03:58.109> of<00:03:58.290> them<00:03:58.410> is<00:03:58.850> if<00:03:59.850> you

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
alpha-thalassemia one of them is if you

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.290 
alpha-thalassemia one of them is if you
have

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:11.250 

I'm<00:04:04.360> just<00:04:04.690> one<00:04:05.260> or<00:04:05.880> two<00:04:06.880> genes<00:04:07.330> and<00:04:10.260> deletion

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
I'm just one or two genes and deletion

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.460 
I'm just one or two genes and deletion
of<00:04:11.350> one<00:04:11.530> or<00:04:11.650> two<00:04:11.800> genes<00:04:12.070> on<00:04:12.630> the<00:04:13.630> alpha<00:04:14.230> globin

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
of one or two genes on the alpha globin

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.180 
of one or two genes on the alpha globin
genes<00:04:15.269> then<00:04:16.269> you<00:04:16.900> usually<00:04:17.410> don't<00:04:17.709> show<00:04:17.980> up

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
genes then you usually don't show up

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.570 
genes then you usually don't show up
with<00:04:18.400> any<00:04:18.549> problems<00:04:19.769> but<00:04:20.769> if<00:04:20.860> you<00:04:20.950> have<00:04:21.130> three

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
with any problems but if you have three

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.750 
with any problems but if you have three
genes<00:04:22.450> that<00:04:22.870> are<00:04:22.930> deleted<00:04:23.560> then<00:04:24.400> you're<00:04:24.610> going

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
genes that are deleted then you're going

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.320 
genes that are deleted then you're going
to<00:04:24.820> end<00:04:25.060> up<00:04:25.270> having<00:04:25.870> a<00:04:27.450> hbh<00:04:28.450> synthesis<00:04:29.200> and<00:04:30.330> hph

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
to end up having a hbh synthesis and hph

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.530 
to end up having a hbh synthesis and hph
is<00:04:31.920> is<00:04:32.920> another<00:04:33.640> form<00:04:34.120> of<00:04:36.090> hemoglobin<00:04:37.090> monomer

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
is is another form of hemoglobin monomer

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:45.230 
is is another form of hemoglobin monomer
and<00:04:39.930> so<00:04:40.930> if<00:04:41.020> you<00:04:41.170> if<00:04:41.410> you<00:04:41.620> have<00:04:41.830> a<00:04:41.860> lot<00:04:42.220> of<00:04:42.660> HBAs

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
and so if you if you have a lot of HBAs

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.610 
and so if you if you have a lot of HBAs
if<00:04:46.240> you<00:04:46.450> have<00:04:46.600> deletion<00:04:47.080> of<00:04:47.200> those<00:04:47.350> three

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
if you have deletion of those three

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:54.540 
if you have deletion of those three
genes<00:04:47.800> you<00:04:48.040> get<00:04:48.900> hbh<00:04:49.900> disease<00:04:53.280> then<00:04:54.280> if<00:04:54.430> you

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
genes you get hbh disease then if you

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.090 
genes you get hbh disease then if you
have<00:04:54.670> deletion<00:04:55.600> of<00:04:55.690> the<00:04:55.750> four<00:04:56.020> genes<00:04:56.230> then

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
have deletion of the four genes then

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.920 
have deletion of the four genes then
that<00:04:57.280> same<00:04:57.610> compatible<00:04:58.210> with<00:04:58.330> life<00:04:58.570> you're

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
that same compatible with life you're

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.070 
that same compatible with life you're
going<00:04:59.380> to<00:04:59.440> have<00:04:59.790> formation<00:05:00.790> of<00:05:02.340> HB<00:05:03.340> Bart

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
going to have formation of HB Bart

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.960 
going to have formation of HB Bart
hemoglobin<00:05:05.080> Bart<00:05:05.320> switches<00:05:05.980> which<00:05:06.520> causes

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
hemoglobin Bart switches which causes

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.770 
hemoglobin Bart switches which causes
hydrops<00:05:07.420> fetalis<00:05:09.270> with<00:05:10.270> beta<00:05:10.540> thalassemia

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
hydrops fetalis with beta thalassemia

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.159 
hydrops fetalis with beta thalassemia
you<00:05:11.710> have<00:05:11.919> the<00:05:12.040> same<00:05:12.220> kind<00:05:12.400> of<00:05:12.610> thing<00:05:13.540> if<00:05:13.720> you

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
you have the same kind of thing if you

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.210 
you have the same kind of thing if you
have<00:05:14.710> a<00:05:16.500> heterozygote<00:05:17.500> it's<00:05:17.800> not<00:05:17.980> going<00:05:18.160> to

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
have a heterozygote it's not going to

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.930 
have a heterozygote it's not going to
cause<00:05:19.030> a<00:05:19.510> whole<00:05:20.200> lot<00:05:20.410> of<00:05:20.500> problems<00:05:20.680> but<00:05:21.610> if<00:05:21.760> you

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
cause a whole lot of problems but if you

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.180 
cause a whole lot of problems but if you
have<00:05:22.210> a<00:05:24.330> homozygote

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
have a homozygote

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.770 
have a homozygote
then<00:05:27.190> you<00:05:27.370> end<00:05:27.490> up<00:05:27.640> with<00:05:27.700> a<00:05:27.910> lot<00:05:28.150> more<00:05:28.300> problems

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
then you end up with a lot more problems

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:37.070 
then you end up with a lot more problems
so<00:05:32.940> then<00:05:33.940> the<00:05:34.090> diagnosis<00:05:34.750> is<00:05:34.930> confirmed<00:05:35.590> by

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
so then the diagnosis is confirmed by

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.450 
so then the diagnosis is confirmed by
hemoglobin<00:05:38.080> electrophoresis<00:05:40.980> with<00:05:41.980> lead

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
hemoglobin electrophoresis with lead

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.720 
hemoglobin electrophoresis with lead
poisoning<00:05:43.150> and<00:05:43.919> you're<00:05:44.919> inhibiting<00:05:45.580> the

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.730 
poisoning and you're inhibiting the

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:53.070 
poisoning and you're inhibiting the
pharoah<00:05:46.030> Kela<00:05:46.540> taste<00:05:47.910> so<00:05:49.290> and<00:05:50.290> the<00:05:51.220> ala<00:05:51.790> and<00:05:52.210> di

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
pharoah Kela taste so and the ala and di

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.790 
pharoah Kela taste so and the ala and di
D<00:05:53.919> hydratase<00:05:54.460> which<00:05:55.419> also<00:05:55.840> decreases<00:05:56.530> heme

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
D hydratase which also decreases heme

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.430 
D hydratase which also decreases heme
synthesis<00:05:57.400> so<00:05:57.790> pretty<00:05:58.570> much<00:05:58.690> all<00:05:58.900> these<00:05:59.169> so

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
synthesis so pretty much all these so

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.740 
synthesis so pretty much all these so
far<00:05:59.680> have<00:05:59.919> been<00:05:59.950> a<00:06:00.220> decrease<00:06:00.880> in<00:06:01.000> heme

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
far have been a decrease in heme
