going to use that potty that's fine what

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.180 
going to use that potty that's fine what
I<00:00:39.270> tell<00:00:39.600> them<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:39.899> why<00:00:40.620> aren't<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.890> using<00:00:41.040> that

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
I tell them is why aren't you using that

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.250 
I tell them is why aren't you using that
as<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> storage<00:00:41.910> compartment<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.989> course<00:00:43.170> they

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
as a storage compartment of course they

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.770 
as a storage compartment of course they
always<00:00:43.500> look<00:00:43.680> at<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.920> cross<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.660> don't<00:00:45.660> know

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
always look at the cross I don't know

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.569 
always look at the cross I don't know
why<00:00:46.050> because<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.800> makes<00:00:46.980> more<00:00:47.129> sense<00:00:47.460> than

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
why because it makes more sense than

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.940 
why because it makes more sense than
anything<00:00:47.940> if<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.750> didn't<00:00:49.110> have<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.289> head<00:00:49.620> there

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
anything if you didn't have a head there

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.279 
anything if you didn't have a head there
then<00:00:50.850> all<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.149> have<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.480> like<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.660> door<00:00:51.899> on<00:00:52.110> this

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
then all you have is like a door on this

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.529 
then all you have is like a door on this
side<00:00:52.649> it'd<00:00:53.399> be<00:00:53.579> harder<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:53.940> get<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.449> the

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
side it'd be harder to get to the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.830 
side it'd be harder to get to the
storage<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:55.110> anyway<00:00:55.730> this<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.910> just<00:00:56.940> cute

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
storage in anyway this is just cute

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.470

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.539 
thing is that they scupper around a lot
of<00:01:54.930> boat<00:01:55.079> builders<00:01:55.470> won't<00:01:55.649> have<00:01:55.860> any<00:01:56.070> stuffing

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
of boat builders won't have any stuffing

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.289 
of boat builders won't have any stuffing
around

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
around

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.109 
around
and<00:01:57.509> that's<00:01:58.200> covering<00:01:58.680> discovered<00:01:59.640> leads<00:01:59.909> to

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
and that's covering discovered leads to

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.380 
and that's covering discovered leads to
a<00:02:00.179> dream<00:02:00.450> which<00:02:00.689> leads<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.229> another<00:02:01.530> dream<00:02:02.390> so

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
a dream which leads to another dream so

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.600 
a dream which leads to another dream so
that<00:02:03.600> helps<00:02:03.960> keep<00:02:04.170> water<00:02:04.770> from<00:02:05.009> running<00:02:05.189> in

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
that helps keep water from running in

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.089 
that helps keep water from running in
from<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.119> cockpit<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:07.200> getting<00:02:07.500> this<00:02:07.649> area

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099
