00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 the girl and a friend preview on a 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.950
 new product proposed by me of the links 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.130
 that the blog drama which is a mascara for 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.309
 colored eyebrows then for those who go 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.049
 well this product definitely for those 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.510
 they don't have the problem or not 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.670
 have eyebrows because of the limit of 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.730
 these products is that it colors not only i 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.670
 hair and not skin this color already 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.590
 slightly more than others 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.260
 mascara that really only attack on 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.540
 veils because I wore it and how 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.680
 you see in some areas where I don't have hair 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.420
 a bit to this more rigid effect goes 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.550
 great for those who want, for example 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.770
 discover his characters because he is 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.899
 present in three colors 1 could 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.570
 use the dark color for square ne 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.579
 it's great for those who used gel 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.809
 transparent for eyebrows because the a 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.250
 long this is a great fixer 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.170
 so you are long eyebrows and that 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.879
 they go where they want it with this 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.270
 fund everything takes two birds with one 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.910
 broad bean 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.790
 because the comb and the mornings keeps 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.439
 in shape and gives it a uniform color 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.299
 which also fills the little holes 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.010
 because it is not said that who has le 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.750
 long eyebrows have not you 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.229
 indeed often when they curl up 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.020
 leave a free and half effect that 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.049
 since it has a dystonic effect it is released 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.900
 in just three colors almost 8 billion 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.930
 interesting products the crisis the 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.400
 packaging did so with a ball the 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.140
 what do I use it for 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.090
 eyebrows because for a great one 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.360
 brown mascara among other things with this 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.600
 ball allows me to work well 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.900
 also eyelashes and to work too 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.570
 those below with the final part 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.270
 it is particular the fact that there is one 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.610
 ball for the eyebrows but to one 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.860
 very very soft toothbrush that 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.780
 just bends her eyelashes and moves them 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.470
 as you like it is therefore a product 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.690
 certainly interesting 10 euros e 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.150
 nothing here is the only limit that 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.710
 for those who have no eyebrows 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.840
 it still takes a pencil 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.729
 let's say that I believe they have one 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.120
 fixed film goes if I put the 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.420
 pencil and then give it over this one stares at me 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.320
 little more even the good pencil a kiss 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.320
