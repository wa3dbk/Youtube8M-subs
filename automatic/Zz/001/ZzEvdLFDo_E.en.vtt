00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.720 
fast the devices perform okay first up
we're<00:00:22.140> going<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.320> look<00:00:22.380> at<00:00:22.470> some<00:00:22.529> apps<00:00:22.890> first

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
we're going to look at some apps first

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.580 
we're going to look at some apps first
quite<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.029> light<00:00:24.269> game<00:00:24.510> flight<00:00:24.869> control<00:00:25.199> so<00:00:25.560> I

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
quite a light game flight control so I

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.050 
quite a light game flight control so I
try<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:25.890> load<00:00:25.980> them<00:00:26.070> both<00:00:26.250> at<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.400> same<00:00:26.609> time

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.970 

as<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.269> see<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.900> item<00:00:31.140> for<00:00:31.349> load<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.710> pre

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
as you see the item for load it pre

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.180 
as you see the item for load it pre
instantly<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.030> then<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:34.260> 3gs<00:00:34.860> coming<00:00:35.100> in

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
instantly and then the 3gs coming in

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.010 
instantly and then the 3gs coming in
just<00:00:35.399> slower<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.850> then<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> more<00:00:36.570> intensive

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
just slower and then a more intensive

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.139 
just slower and then a more intensive
game<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.440> crash<00:00:37.710> bandicoot<00:00:37.920> not<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:38.670> hot<00:00:38.879> too

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
game is crash bandicoot not so hot too

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.910 
game is crash bandicoot not so hot too
so<00:00:39.329> i'll<00:00:40.050> load<00:00:40.230> them<00:00:40.379> up<00:00:40.469> at<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.620> same<00:00:40.770> time

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
so i'll load them up at the same time

00:00:40.920 --> 00:01:00.819 
so i'll load them up at the same time
zone

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.799

so they can see that iphone four once
again<00:01:03.109> was<00:01:03.320> just<00:01:03.620> slightly<00:01:03.829> ahead<00:01:04.100> of<00:01:04.220> the<00:01:04.549> 3gs

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.109 

and<00:01:08.920> there<00:01:09.920> you<00:01:09.979> can<00:01:10.040> see<00:01:10.130> again<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:10.610> iphone<00:01:10.939> 4

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119
