hello everybody it's tyler here and now
we<00:00:02.730> are<00:00:03.000> finally<00:00:03.629> on<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:03.929> in<00:00:04.140> general<00:00:04.680> tips<00:00:04.890> so

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
we are finally on the in general tips so

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.860 
we are finally on the in general tips so
this<00:00:05.670> one<00:00:05.819> will<00:00:05.879> be<00:00:06.029> very<00:00:06.240> important<00:00:06.720> no

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
this one will be very important no

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.500 
this one will be very important no
matter<00:00:06.899> which<00:00:07.470> race<00:00:07.740> you<00:00:07.890> play<00:00:08.130> but<00:00:09.000> let's<00:00:09.269> get

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
matter which race you play but let's get

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.540 
matter which race you play but let's get
started<00:00:09.960> when<00:00:10.320> you're<00:00:10.440> scouting<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:11.070> zerg

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
started when you're scouting a zerg

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.240 
started when you're scouting a zerg
player<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:12.360> you<00:00:13.080> see<00:00:13.440> that<00:00:13.590> their<00:00:13.740> gas<00:00:13.950> is

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
player and you see that their gas is

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.220 
player and you see that their gas is
still<00:00:14.610> mining<00:00:15.030> after<00:00:15.389> they've<00:00:15.570> mined<00:00:15.839> over<00:00:16.080> a

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
still mining after they've mined over a

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.740 
still mining after they've mined over a
hundred<00:00:16.590> which<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.490> signified<00:00:18.029> by<00:00:18.060> if<00:00:18.570> they're

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
hundred which is signified by if they're

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.010 
hundred which is signified by if they're
still<00:00:18.930> mining<00:00:19.289> when<00:00:19.439> there's<00:00:19.650> remaining<00:00:20.100> 2400

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
still mining when there's remaining 2400

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.779 
still mining when there's remaining 2400
then<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.109> can<00:00:22.380> probably<00:00:22.680> expect<00:00:23.220> some<00:00:23.519> roach

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
then you can probably expect some roach

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.640 
then you can probably expect some roach
pressure<00:00:24.150> or<00:00:24.480> banelings<00:00:24.930> because<00:00:25.500> they'll

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
pressure or banelings because they'll

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.990 
pressure or banelings because they'll
only<00:00:25.830> need<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.130> hundred<00:00:26.490> for<00:00:26.640> their<00:00:26.760> metabolic

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
only need a hundred for their metabolic

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.179 
only need a hundred for their metabolic
boost<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.779> lot<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.500> people<00:00:28.769> don't<00:00:29.010> know<00:00:29.099> this

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
boost a lot of people don't know this

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.310 
boost a lot of people don't know this
one<00:00:29.519> but<00:00:29.699> it's<00:00:29.820> actually<00:00:30.090> very<00:00:30.119> useful<00:00:30.810> so

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
one but it's actually very useful so

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.930 
one but it's actually very useful so
basically<00:00:31.830> if<00:00:31.980> you've<00:00:32.130> got<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.309> lot<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.579> idle

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
basically if you've got a lot of idle

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.340 
basically if you've got a lot of idle
workers<00:00:33.300> for<00:00:33.480> whatever<00:00:33.690> reason<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.140> have<00:00:34.260> to

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
workers for whatever reason you have to

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.410 
workers for whatever reason you have to
pull<00:00:34.530> some<00:00:34.800> for<00:00:35.100> an<00:00:35.190> attack<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.090> need<00:00:36.300> to

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
pull some for an attack and you need to

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.540 
pull some for an attack and you need to
get<00:00:36.540> them<00:00:36.719> all<00:00:36.989> back<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.469> mining<00:00:37.680> instead<00:00:38.460> of

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
get them all back to mining instead of

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.490 
get them all back to mining instead of
just<00:00:38.700> pressing<00:00:39.090> f1<00:00:39.570> or<00:00:39.780> clicking<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.379> little

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
just pressing f1 or clicking the little

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.619 
just pressing f1 or clicking the little
icon<00:00:40.920> over<00:00:41.100> here<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.399> has<00:00:41.489> idle<00:00:41.820> workers<00:00:42.149> you

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
icon over here that has idle workers you

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.690 
icon over here that has idle workers you
can<00:00:42.780> just<00:00:42.930> press<00:00:43.140> ctrl<00:00:43.620> f<00:00:43.770> 1<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.579> will

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
can just press ctrl f 1 and that will

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.100 
can just press ctrl f 1 and that will
select<00:00:44.940> all<00:00:45.120> your<00:00:45.270> idle<00:00:45.570> workers<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.020> then

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
select all your idle workers and then

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.299 
select all your idle workers and then
you<00:00:46.170> can<00:00:46.289> easily<00:00:46.620> send<00:00:46.829> them<00:00:46.950> back<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.280> a

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
you can easily send them back to a

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.639 
you can easily send them back to a
mineral<00:00:47.700> field<00:00:47.910> I'm<00:00:48.510> also<00:00:48.719> surprised<00:00:49.230> by<00:00:49.410> how

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
mineral field I'm also surprised by how

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.110 
mineral field I'm also surprised by how
many<00:00:49.710> people<00:00:49.980> don't<00:00:50.370> know<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.640> next<00:00:50.969> one

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
many people don't know this next one

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.779 
many people don't know this next one
which<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.899> very<00:00:52.170> useful<00:00:52.230> if<00:00:52.680> you're<00:00:52.829> scouting

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
which is very useful if you're scouting

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.580 
which is very useful if you're scouting
and<00:00:54.030> your<00:00:54.149> worker<00:00:54.329> gets<00:00:54.570> surrounded<00:00:54.809> or<00:00:55.379> some

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
and your worker gets surrounded or some

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.869 
and your worker gets surrounded or some
are<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.129> get<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> worker<00:00:56.489> through<00:00:56.730> your

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
are you to get a worker through your

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.970 
are you to get a worker through your
wall<00:00:57.059> without<00:00:57.210> moving<00:00:57.629> your<00:00:57.660> zealot<00:00:58.050> as<00:00:58.199> you

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
wall without moving your zealot as you

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.349 
wall without moving your zealot as you
can<00:00:59.070> see<00:00:59.250> right<00:00:59.280> here<00:00:59.550> if<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.820> just<00:00:59.850> try<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.210> move

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
can see right here if I just try to move

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.840 
can see right here if I just try to move
it<00:01:00.510> through<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:01.500> won't<00:01:01.770> do<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.070> but<00:01:02.699> if<00:01:02.820> you

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
it through it won't do it but if you

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.670 
it through it won't do it but if you
click<00:01:03.120> on<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.270> mineral<00:01:03.660> field<00:01:03.870> or<00:01:04.019> like<00:01:04.260> any

click on a mineral field or like any
mineral<00:01:05.100> field<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:06.240> can<00:01:06.390> go<00:01:06.540> through<00:01:07.939> as<00:01:08.939> you

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
mineral field you can go through as you

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.810 
mineral field you can go through as you
can<00:01:09.210> see<00:01:09.420> right<00:01:09.450> there<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:09.960> also<00:01:10.830> if<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.670> have

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
can see right there and also if you have

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.899 
can see right there and also if you have
one<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.510> already<00:01:13.290> has<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> mineral<00:01:13.950> instead

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
one that already has a mineral instead

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.420 
one that already has a mineral instead
of<00:01:15.030> clicking<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.420> mineral<00:01:15.780> field<00:01:16.159> what<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.280> can

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
of clicking a mineral field what you can

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.520 
of clicking a mineral field what you can
do<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.880> hit<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.570> little<00:01:18.689> overturned<00:01:19.110> cargo

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
do is hit the little overturned cargo

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.429 
do is hit the little overturned cargo
which<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.920> default<00:01:20.400> as<00:01:20.640> C<00:01:21.030> for<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.840> hockey<00:01:22.259> and

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
which is default as C for the hockey and

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.289 
which is default as C for the hockey and
then<00:01:22.950> I'll<00:01:23.159> bring<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.580> nexus<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.210> then

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
then I'll bring it to a nexus and then

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.330 
then I'll bring it to a nexus and then
get<00:01:24.479> back<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.689> mining<00:01:24.990> it's<00:01:25.680> kind<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.070> hard<00:01:26.280> to

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
get back to mining it's kind of hard to

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.999 
get back to mining it's kind of hard to
spot<00:01:26.670> but<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:26.970> can<00:01:27.180> actually<00:01:27.420> see<00:01:27.659> burl<00:01:28.560> units

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
spot but you can actually see burl units

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.230 
spot but you can actually see burl units
as<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.250> can<00:01:29.400> see<00:01:29.549> there's<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.909> bunch<00:01:30.150> of

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
as you can see there's a bunch of

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.749 
as you can see there's a bunch of
burglaries<00:01:30.420> right<00:01:30.960> here<00:01:31.220> so<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.369> Zerg<00:01:32.520> goes

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
burglaries right here so the Zerg goes

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.810 
burglaries right here so the Zerg goes
ahead<00:01:32.880> some<00:01:33.150> attacks<00:01:33.479> burrows<00:01:34.430> now<00:01:35.430> as<00:01:35.759> you

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
ahead some attacks burrows now as you

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.280 
ahead some attacks burrows now as you
can<00:01:36.090> tell<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.299> don't<00:01:36.509> have<00:01:36.630> an<00:01:36.750> observer<00:01:37.079> but

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
can tell I don't have an observer but

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.690 
can tell I don't have an observer but
I'm<00:01:37.409> just<00:01:37.530> going<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.740> go<00:01:37.799> in<00:01:37.890> my<00:01:38.100> vision<00:01:38.430> here

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
I'm just going to go in my vision here

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.429 
I'm just going to go in my vision here
and<00:01:39.890> I'll<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:41.130> put<00:01:41.340> on<00:01:41.430> normal<00:01:41.759> speed<00:01:42.439> not

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
and I'll just put on normal speed not

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.830 
and I'll just put on normal speed not
sure<00:01:43.740> how<00:01:44.520> hard<00:01:44.850> like<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.240> kind<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.570> hard<00:01:45.810> to

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
sure how hard like it's kind of hard to

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.109 
sure how hard like it's kind of hard to
tell<00:01:45.960> but<00:01:46.860> there's<00:01:47.040> actually<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:49.939> how<00:01:50.939> do<00:01:51.000> I

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
tell but there's actually this how do I

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.760 
tell but there's actually this how do I
explain<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:51.689> see<00:01:51.840> like<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.200> bunch<00:01:52.649> of

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
explain it you can see like a bunch of

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.030 
explain it you can see like a bunch of
black<00:01:53.549> dots<00:01:54.119> moving<00:01:54.420> here<00:01:54.860> those<00:01:55.860> are<00:01:56.009> all

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
black dots moving here those are all

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.770 
black dots moving here those are all
roaches<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.790> mean<00:01:56.969> even<00:01:57.540> if<00:01:57.630> they're

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
roaches and I mean even if they're

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.149 
roaches and I mean even if they're
moving<00:01:58.079> or<00:01:58.170> not<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.409> can<00:01:58.560> actually<00:01:58.770> see<00:01:58.979> if

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
moving or not you can actually see if

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.200 
moving or not you can actually see if
there's<00:01:59.340> just<00:01:59.460> like<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.670> burrowed<00:02:00.030> banelings

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
there's just like a burrowed banelings

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.760 
there's just like a burrowed banelings
they'll<00:02:00.630> be<00:02:00.840> like<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:00.990> little<00:02:01.229> dark<00:02:01.469> spot

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
they'll be like a little dark spot

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.740 
they'll be like a little dark spot
taking<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.610> look<00:02:02.759> at<00:02:02.880> these<00:02:03.000> zerglings<00:02:03.420> here<00:02:03.630> we

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
taking a look at these zerglings here we

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.600 
taking a look at these zerglings here we
can<00:02:03.930> see<00:02:04.110> at<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.229> bottom<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:05.219> they're<00:02:05.430> both

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
can see at the bottom that they're both

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.270 
can see at the bottom that they're both
light<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.119> biological<00:02:07.110> however<00:02:07.920> once

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
light and biological however once

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.050 
light and biological however once
they've<00:02:08.489> morphed<00:02:08.819> into<00:02:08.910> banelings<00:02:10.700> they<00:02:11.700> are

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
they've morphed into banelings they are

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.410 
they've morphed into banelings they are
only<00:02:12.770> biologic

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
only biologic

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.610 
only biologic
if<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.540> can<00:02:15.690> click<00:02:15.810> on<00:02:15.960> here<00:02:16.080> yeah<00:02:16.290> they're<00:02:16.500> only

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
if I can click on here yeah they're only

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.550 
if I can click on here yeah they're only
biological<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:17.850> units<00:02:18.750> such<00:02:18.930> as<00:02:18.959> hellions

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
biological so units such as hellions

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.890 
biological so units such as hellions
what<00:02:20.310> won't<00:02:20.640> get<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:20.940> extra<00:02:21.240> damage<00:02:21.420> versus

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
what won't get the extra damage versus

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.500 
what won't get the extra damage versus
them<00:02:22.080> so<00:02:22.290> that's<00:02:22.380> something<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.680> keep<00:02:22.950> in<00:02:23.100> mind

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
them so that's something to keep in mind

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.870 
them so that's something to keep in mind
but<00:02:24.510> that's<00:02:24.750> pretty<00:02:24.990> much<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.200> for<00:02:25.380> this<00:02:25.530> video

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880
