00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
highlights for you so far the highlight

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.680 
highlights for you so far the highlight
for<00:00:47.100> me<00:00:47.160> honestly<00:00:47.489> was<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.570> opening

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
for me honestly was in the opening

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.119 
for me honestly was in the opening
ceremony<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.590> look<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.800> think<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.039> was

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
ceremony and look I think it was

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.250 
ceremony and look I think it was
cheating<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.730> when<00:00:50.910> Paralympics<00:00:51.690> gb<00:00:51.989> came

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
cheating that when Paralympics gb came

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.799 
cheating that when Paralympics gb came
out<00:00:52.469> we<00:00:53.250> can<00:00:53.430> be<00:00:53.550> heroes<00:00:53.850> was<00:00:54.210> blaring<00:00:54.539> and

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
out we can be heroes was blaring and

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.510 
out we can be heroes was blaring and
glitter<00:00:55.140> cannons<00:00:55.500> went<00:00:55.739> off<00:00:55.890> I'm<00:00:56.100> pretty<00:00:56.340> sure

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
glitter cannons went off I'm pretty sure

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.939 
glitter cannons went off I'm pretty sure
that<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.850> actually<00:00:57.270> cheating<00:00:57.739> I'm<00:00:58.739> not

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
that is actually cheating I'm not

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.139 
that is actually cheating I'm not
entirely<00:00:59.250> sure<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.520> need<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.730> look<00:00:59.820> at<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.000> tape

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
entirely sure I need to look at the tape

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.220 
entirely sure I need to look at the tape
but<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.329> think<00:01:00.480> when<00:01:00.570> Australia<00:01:00.930> came<00:01:01.079> out

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
but I think when Australia came out

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.729 
but I think when Australia came out
common<00:01:01.559> people<00:01:01.890> was<00:01:02.010> played<00:01:03.500> nothing<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.559> just
