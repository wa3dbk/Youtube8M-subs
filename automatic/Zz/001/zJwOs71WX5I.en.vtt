color laser printer I don't recommend NJ
NJ<00:02:40.550> even<00:02:41.540> though<00:02:41.660> nowadays<00:02:41.990> are<00:02:42.560> better<00:02:42.890> than

NJ even though nowadays are better than

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.390 
NJ even though nowadays are better than
the<00:02:43.310> old<00:02:43.520> days<00:02:43.700> they<00:02:43.910> don't<00:02:44.090> end<00:02:44.270> it<00:02:44.420> gets<00:02:44.600> much

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
the old days they don't end it gets much

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.280 
the old days they don't end it gets much
still<00:02:46.400> they're<00:02:46.700> actually<00:02:47.030> very<00:02:47.170> expensive<00:02:48.170> to

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
still they're actually very expensive to

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.250 
still they're actually very expensive to
run<00:02:48.470> and<00:02:48.770> also<00:02:49.490> you<00:02:50.360> know<00:02:50.480> when<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:50.900> comes<00:02:51.050> to

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
run and also you know when it comes to

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.390 
run and also you know when it comes to
find<00:02:51.530> text<00:02:52.070> going<00:02:52.520> onto<00:02:52.760> a<00:02:53.330> product<00:02:53.780> label

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
laser printer is far better of course

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.200 
laser printer is far better of course
you<00:02:57.560> can<00:02:57.710> also<00:02:57.860> look<00:02:58.160> at<00:02:58.430> there<00:02:58.820> are<00:02:58.850> other

you can also look at there are other

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.500 
you can also look at there are other
other<00:03:00.110> little<00:03:00.500> labels<00:03:00.950> like<00:03:01.190> you<00:03:01.760> know<00:03:01.910> what

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
other little labels like you know what

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.180 
other little labels like you know what
they<00:03:02.630> call<00:03:02.810> it<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.080> thermal<00:03:03.560> printers<00:03:03.980> and

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
they call it the thermal printers and

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.320 
they call it the thermal printers and
stuff<00:03:04.400> like<00:03:04.580> that<00:03:04.640> those<00:03:05.480> will<00:03:05.810> give<00:03:06.080> you<00:03:06.260> less

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
stuff like that those will give you less

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.050 
stuff like that those will give you less
design<00:03:08.330> option<00:03:09.080> and<00:03:09.350> they<00:03:09.830> don't<00:03:09.980> print<00:03:10.430> you

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
design option and they don't print you

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.990 
design option and they don't print you
know<00:03:11.440> graduating<00:03:12.440> tones<00:03:12.740> as<00:03:13.130> well<00:03:13.340> but<00:03:13.910> again

know graduating tones as well but again

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.670 
know graduating tones as well but again
it<00:03:14.360> just<00:03:14.390> depends<00:03:14.990> on<00:03:15.050> what<00:03:15.200> you<00:03:15.350> want<00:03:15.380> to

these labels that have got all the
information<00:03:46.700> on<00:03:47.450> it<00:03:47.780> so<00:03:48.410> what<00:03:48.680> happens<00:03:49.070> is<00:03:49.280> if

in have a think about that you know how

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.810 
in have a think about that you know how
you<00:05:23.990> can<00:05:24.290> keep<00:05:24.590> them<00:05:24.800> you<00:05:25.130> know<00:05:25.220> quite<00:05:25.460> clean

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
you can keep them you know quite clean

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.790 
you can keep them you know quite clean
so<00:05:26.510> you<00:05:26.930> know<00:05:27.050> the<00:05:27.170> most<00:05:27.350> important

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
so you know the most important

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.620 
so you know the most important
information<00:05:28.460> such<00:05:28.760> as<00:05:28.820> the<00:05:29.090> ingredient<00:05:29.570> of

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
information such as the ingredient of

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.320 
information such as the ingredient of
brewing<00:05:29.990> instructions<00:05:30.500> are<00:05:31.130> there<00:05:31.670> you<00:05:32.180> know

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
brewing instructions are there you know

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.210 
brewing instructions are there you know
and<00:05:32.540> how<00:05:33.050> you<00:05:33.110> can<00:05:33.260> multi-purpose<00:05:33.740> them<00:05:34.070> as

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
and how you can multi-purpose them as

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.850 
and how you can multi-purpose them as
well<00:05:34.430> because<00:05:34.850> most<00:05:35.510> of<00:05:35.630> tea<00:05:35.810> can<00:05:36.380> be<00:05:36.410> brewed<00:05:36.740> a

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
well because most of tea can be brewed a

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.040 
well because most of tea can be brewed a
same<00:05:37.070> way<00:05:37.280> so<00:05:37.340> again<00:05:38.060> if<00:05:38.240> you<00:05:38.360> are<00:05:38.390> in<00:05:38.630> exile
