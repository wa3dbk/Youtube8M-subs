like that and we had pretty good

like that and we had pretty good

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
like that it's not an IPS panel it's

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.420 
like that it's not an IPS panel it's
definitely<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.180> TN<00:01:45.570> screen<00:01:46.020> but<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.920> again

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
definitely a TN screen but it is again

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.280 
definitely a TN screen but it is again
they<00:01:47.640> have<00:01:47.790> been<00:01:48.180> improving<00:01:48.630> on<00:01:48.930> TN

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
they have been improving on TN

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.280 
they have been improving on TN
technology<00:01:50.060> pretty<00:01:51.060> rapidly<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.630> think<00:01:52.079> and

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
technology pretty rapidly I think and

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.840 
technology pretty rapidly I think and
this<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.470> another<00:01:52.799> one<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.009> those<00:01:53.250> pretty<00:01:53.670> good

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
this is another one of those pretty good

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.770 
this is another one of those pretty good
examples<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:56.009> stand<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.729> decent<00:01:57.630> it

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
examples of that the stand is decent it

ports on the underside of the monitor

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.520 
ports on the underside of the monitor
which<00:02:48.630> is<00:02:48.660> which<00:02:48.900> is<00:02:49.020> kinda<00:02:49.200> nice<00:02:49.260> one<00:02:49.470> of

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
which is which is kinda nice one of

which is which is kinda nice one of
those<00:02:49.620> ports<00:02:49.950> is<00:02:50.070> actually<00:02:50.550> they<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.060> think

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
those ports is actually they I think

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.180 
those ports is actually they I think
they<00:02:51.390> call<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:51.540> USB<00:02:52.260> charge<00:02:52.680> where<00:02:52.980> they<00:02:53.070> so

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
they call it USB charge where they so

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.160 
they call it USB charge where they so
even<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.490> monitors<00:02:53.850> off<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.810> will<00:02:54.959> still

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
even the monitors off that will still

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.870 
even the monitors off that will still
charge<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.650> power<00:02:55.770> it<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.610> only<00:02:56.730> other

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
charge and power it the only other

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.550 
charge and power it the only other
complaint<00:02:57.270> I<00:02:57.390> really<00:02:57.600> have<00:02:57.810> about<00:02:58.170> that<00:02:58.350> is

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
complaint I really have about that is

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.350 
complaint I really have about that is
the<00:02:58.800> DisplayPort<00:02:59.430> cable<00:02:59.700> they<00:02:59.820> give<00:03:00.000> you<00:03:00.150> is

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
the DisplayPort cable they give you is

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.770 
the DisplayPort cable they give you is
only<00:03:00.540> like<00:03:00.750> 4<00:03:01.320> feet<00:03:01.590> long<00:03:01.730> which<00:03:02.730> is<00:03:02.940> kind<00:03:03.750> of

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
only like 4 feet long which is kind of

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.030 
only like 4 feet long which is kind of
annoying<00:03:04.020> even<00:03:04.260> where<00:03:04.500> we<00:03:04.590> had<00:03:04.740> to<00:03:04.860> monitor

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
annoying even where we had to monitor

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.520 
annoying even where we had to monitor
set<00:03:05.430> up<00:03:05.520> on<00:03:05.640> our<00:03:05.730> test<00:03:06.060> bed<00:03:06.300> and<00:03:06.660> we're<00:03:07.350> playing

a<00:03:11.459> little<00:03:11.700> bit<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:11.880> a<00:03:11.940> limiting<00:03:12.240> factor<00:03:12.270> not<00:03:13.110> a

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
a little bit of a limiting factor not a

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.610 
a little bit of a limiting factor not a
big<00:03:13.410> deal<00:03:13.650> but<00:03:14.550> I<00:03:14.610> think<00:03:14.850> for<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.110> $699<00:03:16.110> monitor

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
big deal but I think for a $699 monitor

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.640 
big deal but I think for a $699 monitor
maybe<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.610> 6<00:03:18.330> or<00:03:18.540> maybe<00:03:18.989> even<00:03:19.080> 10-foot

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
the previous g-sync monitor we looked at

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.710 
the previous g-sync monitor we looked at
this<00:04:01.470> is<00:04:01.650> a<00:04:01.680> 60<00:04:02.010> Hertz<00:04:02.040> panel<00:04:02.519> not<00:04:02.670> 144<00:04:03.510> Hertz

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
this is a 60 Hertz panel not 144 Hertz

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.780 
this is a 60 Hertz panel not 144 Hertz
panel<00:04:04.049> so<00:04:04.170> that<00:04:04.320> means<00:04:04.470> essentially<00:04:04.890> if<00:04:05.190> your

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
panel so that means essentially if your

panel so that means essentially if your
game<00:04:06.090> is<00:04:06.120> able<00:04:06.570> to<00:04:06.660> run<00:04:06.810> at<00:04:06.930> 60<00:04:07.260> Hertz<00:04:07.290> or

you're basically going to be capped at

that 60 frames per second level and any

that 60 frames per second level and any
kind<00:04:13.590> of<00:04:14.180> stutter<00:04:15.180> issues<00:04:15.660> that<00:04:15.810> may<00:04:15.959> have

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
kind of stutter issues that may have

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.680 
kind of stutter issues that may have
shown<00:04:16.410> up<00:04:16.560> with<00:04:16.739> vsync<00:04:17.190> enabled<00:04:17.669> would<00:04:18.299> maybe

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
shown up with vsync enabled would maybe

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.070 
shown up with vsync enabled would maybe
show<00:04:19.080> up<00:04:19.290> here<00:04:19.620> right<00:04:19.859> but<00:04:20.690> again<00:04:21.690> this<00:04:21.930> is<00:04:22.049> a

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
show up here right but again this is a

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.380 
show up here right but again this is a
4k<00:04:22.500> monitors<00:04:22.890> can<00:04:23.010> require<00:04:23.280> a<00:04:23.340> lot<00:04:23.700> of<00:04:23.729> GPU

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
4k monitors can require a lot of GPU

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.170 
4k monitors can require a lot of GPU
horsepower<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.650> keep<00:04:25.919> it<00:04:26.130> fed<00:04:26.400> with<00:04:26.610> frames

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
horsepower to keep it fed with frames

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.610 
horsepower to keep it fed with frames
so<00:04:27.750> if<00:04:28.710> any<00:04:29.070> monitor<00:04:29.580> resolution<00:04:30.570> we're<00:04:31.290> going

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
so if any monitor resolution we're going

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.020 
so if any monitor resolution we're going
to<00:04:31.740> see<00:04:31.949> benefits<00:04:32.400> of<00:04:32.550> g-sync

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
to see benefits of g-sync

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.909 
to see benefits of g-sync
I<00:04:33.090> think<00:04:33.360> this<00:04:33.540> is<00:04:33.690> it<00:04:33.840> right<00:04:33.870> so<00:04:34.259> in<00:04:34.440> my

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
g-sync I think makes more sense on this

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.249 
g-sync I think makes more sense on this
type<00:05:22.979> of<00:05:23.010> screen<00:05:23.460> it<00:05:24.120> does<00:05:24.330> not<00:05:24.449> have<00:05:24.630> you<00:05:24.780> LMB

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
type of screen it does not have you LMB

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.010 
type of screen it does not have you LMB
even<00:05:25.979> though<00:05:26.070> the<00:05:26.610> menus<00:05:27.000> have<00:05:27.599> that<00:05:27.840> option

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
even though the menus have that option

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.420 
even though the menus have that option
and<00:05:28.259> they're<00:05:28.380> grayed<00:05:28.650> out<00:05:28.680> I<00:05:28.860> don't<00:05:29.190> really

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
and they're grayed out I don't really

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.740 
and they're grayed out I don't really
understand<00:05:29.789> what<00:05:29.910> that<00:05:29.940> case<00:05:30.240> is<00:05:30.389> because

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
understand what that case is because

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.330 
understand what that case is because
it's<00:05:30.870> only<00:05:30.990> a<00:05:31.050> 60<00:05:31.349> Hertz<00:05:31.380> panel<00:05:31.860> it<00:05:32.010> doesn't<00:05:32.280> do

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
it's only a 60 Hertz panel it doesn't do

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.730 
it's only a 60 Hertz panel it doesn't do
you<00:05:32.460> LMB<00:05:32.789> and<00:05:32.820> it<00:05:33.000> doesn't<00:05:33.270> do<00:05:33.330> 3d<00:05:33.660> vision<00:05:33.900> so

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
you LMB and it doesn't do 3d vision so

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.920 
you LMB and it doesn't do 3d vision so

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.339 
then just gaming then this Acer panel
would<00:06:24.120> probably<00:06:24.449> be<00:06:24.510> the<00:06:24.630> one<00:06:24.750> for<00:06:24.960> you<00:06:25.020> also

Hertz refresh it comes down to a lot of

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.580 
Hertz refresh it comes down to a lot of
personal<00:06:51.190> preference<00:06:51.639> in<00:06:51.789> that<00:06:52.539> case<00:06:52.810> in

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.590 
personal preference in that case in
