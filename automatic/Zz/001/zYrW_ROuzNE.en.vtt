up<00:00:49.120> until<00:00:49.480> a<00:00:49.540> few<00:00:49.629> years<00:00:49.840> ago<00:00:50.170> your<00:00:50.649> shifter

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
up until a few years ago your shifter

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.520 
up until a few years ago your shifter
options<00:00:51.640> were<00:00:51.850> either<00:00:52.149> manual<00:00:52.840> or<00:00:52.870> automatic

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
options were either manual or automatic

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.189 
options were either manual or automatic
now<00:00:54.220> it<00:00:54.550> seems<00:00:54.850> there<00:00:55.149> are<00:00:55.180> limitless<00:00:55.780> ways

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
now it seems there are limitless ways

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.799 
now it seems there are limitless ways
you<00:00:56.829> can<00:00:57.070> gear<00:00:57.309> up<00:00:57.340> gear<00:00:57.879> down<00:00:58.059> and<00:00:58.120> get<00:00:58.690> what

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
you can gear up gear down and get what

friend and auto expert Tom Collins so
Tom<00:01:05.590> tell<00:01:06.130> me<00:01:06.220> I<00:01:06.250> thought<00:01:06.550> there<00:01:06.729> was<00:01:06.820> just<00:01:07.060> two

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
Tom tell me I thought there was just two

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.910 
Tom tell me I thought there was just two
ways<00:01:07.570> you<00:01:07.600> can<00:01:07.900> shift<00:01:08.259> gears<00:01:08.500> manual

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
ways you can shift gears manual

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.350 
ways you can shift gears manual
automatic<00:01:09.070> or<00:01:09.490> do<00:01:09.550> the<00:01:09.640> others<00:01:09.909> well<00:01:10.180> there's

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
automatic or do the others well there's

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.790 
automatic or do the others well there's
a<00:01:10.450> couple<00:01:10.600> other<00:01:10.810> ways<00:01:11.170> now<00:01:11.440> you've<00:01:11.680> got

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
a couple other ways now you've got

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.649 
a couple other ways now you've got
paddle<00:01:12.250> shifters<00:01:12.640> for<00:01:12.670> example<00:01:13.300> Rose<00:01:13.450> which

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
paddle shifters for example Rose which

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.090 
paddle shifters for example Rose which
are<00:01:13.810> mounted<00:01:13.960> on<00:01:14.200> the<00:01:14.350> steering<00:01:14.560> wheel<00:01:14.710> that

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
are mounted on the steering wheel that

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.130 
are mounted on the steering wheel that
allows<00:01:15.399> you<00:01:15.610> to<00:01:15.640> shift<00:01:16.060> up<00:01:16.240> and<00:01:16.450> down<00:01:16.600> what<00:01:17.110> you

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
allows you to shift up and down what you

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.630 
allows you to shift up and down what you
want<00:01:17.470> that<00:01:17.649> if<00:01:17.770> you're<00:01:17.920> driving<00:01:18.220> around<00:01:18.310> town

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
want that if you're driving around town

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.370 
want that if you're driving around town
is<00:01:18.970> that<00:01:19.000> more<00:01:19.330> like<00:01:19.479> for<00:01:19.690> a<00:01:19.720> race<00:01:19.869> car<00:01:20.080> driver

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
is that more like for a race car driver

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.560 
is that more like for a race car driver
it's<00:01:20.680> great<00:01:21.039> for<00:01:21.280> racing<00:01:21.700> in<00:01:21.789> fact<00:01:22.030> Ferrari

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
it's great for racing in fact Ferrari

just ferrario tiny differences between
like<00:01:33.399> a<00:01:33.429> semi<00:01:34.000> automatic<00:01:34.600> transmission<00:01:35.259> and

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
like a semi automatic transmission and

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.560 
like a semi automatic transmission and
an<00:01:35.770> automatic<00:01:36.039> transit<00:01:36.580> great<00:01:36.820> question<00:01:37.360> Rose

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
an automatic transit great question Rose

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.840 
an automatic transit great question Rose
semi-automatic<00:01:38.500> is<00:01:38.649> basically<00:01:39.160> a<00:01:39.369> clutchless

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
semi-automatic is basically a clutchless

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.749 
semi-automatic is basically a clutchless
manual<00:01:40.619> transmission<00:01:41.619> in<00:01:42.070> other<00:01:42.220> words<00:01:42.460> it

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
manual transmission in other words it

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:43.919 
manual transmission in other words it
operates<00:01:43.179> like<00:01:43.360> a<00:01:43.420> manual<00:01:43.690> transmission

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
operates like a manual transmission

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:45.900 
operates like a manual transmission
except<00:01:44.740> there's<00:01:44.920> no<00:01:44.979> clutch<00:01:45.399> pedal<00:01:45.759> you've

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
except there's no clutch pedal you've

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.550 
except there's no clutch pedal you've
just<00:01:46.090> got<00:01:46.210> a<00:01:46.240> brake<00:01:46.509> pedal<00:01:46.869> and<00:01:46.960> a<00:01:47.050> gas<00:01:47.229> gotta

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
just got a brake pedal and a gas gotta

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.200 
just got a brake pedal and a gas gotta
like<00:01:47.740> a<00:01:47.770> regular<00:01:48.100> automatic<00:01:48.789> and<00:01:48.909> the<00:01:49.000> car

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
like a regular automatic and the car

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.210 
like a regular automatic and the car
kind<00:01:49.360> of<00:01:49.479> does<00:01:49.600> it<00:01:49.750> for<00:01:49.929> you<00:01:50.020> hard<00:01:50.500> does<00:01:50.800> it<00:01:51.009> for

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
kind of does it for you hard does it for

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.400 
kind of does it for you hard does it for
you<00:01:51.369> ship<00:01:51.700> it<00:01:52.119> makes<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.569> clutch<00:01:52.959> action

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
you ship it makes the clutch action

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.109 
you ship it makes the clutch action
automatically<00:01:54.190> so<00:01:54.340> you<00:01:54.369> don't<00:01:54.610> have<00:01:54.729> to<00:01:54.880> do<00:01:55.000> it

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
automatically so you don't have to do it

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:56.430 
automatically so you don't have to do it
so<00:01:55.270> you<00:01:55.300> get<00:01:55.479> better<00:01:55.720> fuel<00:01:55.899> economy<00:01:56.050> and

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
so you get better fuel economy and

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.410 
so you get better fuel economy and
better<00:01:56.800> performance<00:01:57.399> which<00:01:57.789> is<00:01:57.940> why<00:01:58.090> you<00:01:58.119> find

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
better performance which is why you find

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.330

child that but then when you put in and

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.380 
child that but then when you put in and
drive<00:02:08.830> you<00:02:08.979> can<00:02:09.099> shift<00:02:09.429> it<00:02:09.610> over<00:02:09.729> to<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.149> side

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
drive you can shift it over to the side

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.449 
drive you can shift it over to the side
and<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:11.319> tell<00:02:11.590> me<00:02:11.680> about<00:02:11.770> that<00:02:11.980> a<00:02:12.190> lot<00:02:12.400> of

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
and and tell me about that a lot of

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:13.860 
and and tell me about that a lot of
times<00:02:12.700> they'll<00:02:12.849> be<00:02:12.970> a<00:02:13.000> little<00:02:13.150> slide<00:02:13.450> over<00:02:13.750> to

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
times they'll be a little slide over to

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.570 
times they'll be a little slide over to
the<00:02:13.959> side<00:02:14.170> with<00:02:14.349> a<00:02:14.410> plus<00:02:14.650> and<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:15.010> minus<00:02:15.190> side

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
the side with a plus and a minus side

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.160 
the side with a plus and a minus side
and<00:02:15.849> on<00:02:15.910> semi<00:02:16.209> automatics<00:02:16.780> all<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:16.989> have<00:02:17.080> to

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
and on semi automatics all you have to

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.990 
and on semi automatics all you have to
do<00:02:17.260> is<00:02:17.349> just<00:02:17.500> move<00:02:17.739> the<00:02:17.890> gear<00:02:18.040> shifter<00:02:18.489> either

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
do is just move the gear shifter either

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.510 
do is just move the gear shifter either
we<00:02:19.209> had<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.690> shift<00:02:20.140> up<00:02:20.349> or<00:02:20.410> back<00:02:20.920> to<00:02:20.980> shift<00:02:21.400> down

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
we had to shift up or back to shift down

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.490 
we had to shift up or back to shift down
so<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:22.420> can<00:02:22.569> do<00:02:22.660> that<00:02:22.840> either<00:02:22.959> yourself

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
so you can do that either yourself

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.650 
so you can do that either yourself
manually<00:02:23.950> without<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:24.819> clutch<00:02:25.060> or<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:25.510> can

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
manually without the clutch or you can

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.089 
manually without the clutch or you can
let<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:25.900> do<00:02:26.020> it<00:02:26.140> for<00:02:26.379> you<00:02:26.500> which<00:02:26.650> is<00:02:26.680> really

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
let it do it for you which is really

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:28.710 
let it do it for you which is really
slick<00:02:27.430> as<00:02:27.580> you<00:02:27.670> get<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.849> best<00:02:28.030> of<00:02:28.180> both<00:02:28.239> worlds

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
slick as you get the best of both worlds

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.729 
slick as you get the best of both worlds
so<00:02:28.989> I<00:02:29.260> hear<00:02:29.500> these<00:02:29.770> words<00:02:30.450> geartronic

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
so I hear these words geartronic

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.930 
so I hear these words geartronic
tiptronic<00:02:32.739> what<00:02:32.950> what<00:02:33.250> is<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.520> can<00:02:33.849> you

same<00:02:37.030> thing<00:02:37.540> just<00:02:37.569> a<00:02:38.050> semi-automatic

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
same thing just a semi-automatic

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.160 
same thing just a semi-automatic
transmission<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.819> clutchless<00:02:40.120> manual<00:02:40.360> some

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
transmission the clutchless manual some

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.570 
transmission the clutchless manual some
people<00:02:41.440> call<00:02:41.620> so<00:02:41.890> with<00:02:42.190> a<00:02:42.220> manual

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
people call so with a manual

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.860 
people call so with a manual
transmission<00:02:42.760> you're<00:02:43.330> worried<00:02:43.569> about<00:02:43.629> your

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
transmission you're worried about your

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.509 
transmission you're worried about your
college<00:02:44.140> going<00:02:44.410> out<00:02:44.560> all<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.709> time<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:45.220> then

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
college going out all the time and then

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.100 
college going out all the time and then
with<00:02:45.700> an<00:02:45.819> automatic<00:02:46.209> transmission<00:02:46.390> you're

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
with an automatic transmission you're

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.770 
with an automatic transmission you're
worried<00:02:47.560> about<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:48.550> transmission<00:02:49.330> going<00:02:49.599> out

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
worried about the transmission going out

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.210 
worried about the transmission going out
is<00:02:50.080> there<00:02:50.349> anything<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:50.800> need<00:02:50.920> to<00:02:51.010> worry

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
is there anything you need to worry

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.950 
is there anything you need to worry
about

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
about

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.080 
about
well<00:02:52.770> anything<00:02:53.220> that's<00:02:53.580> made<00:02:53.790> by<00:02:53.850> a<00:02:54.000> human

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
well anything that's made by a human

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.930 
well anything that's made by a human
being<00:02:54.540> can<00:02:54.660> break<00:02:55.140> okay<00:02:55.680> we<00:02:55.980> know<00:02:56.160> that<00:02:56.190> so

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
being can break okay we know that so

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.060 
being can break okay we know that so
they're<00:02:57.570> not<00:02:57.750> infallible<00:02:58.230> but<00:02:58.560> they're<00:02:58.830> very

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
they're not infallible but they're very

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.320 
they're not infallible but they're very
good<00:02:59.160> in<00:02:59.430> terms<00:02:59.580> of<00:02:59.790> maintenance<00:03:00.030> you've

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
good in terms of maintenance you've

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.420 
good in terms of maintenance you've
really<00:03:00.540> got<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:01.110> clutch<00:03:01.380> is<00:03:01.620> shifted<00:03:02.280> by<00:03:02.400> a

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
really got the clutch is shifted by a

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.820 
really got the clutch is shifted by a
computer<00:03:03.140> electronically<00:03:04.140> so<00:03:04.320> it<00:03:04.440> shifts<00:03:04.620> it

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
computer electronically so it shifts it

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.620 
computer electronically so it shifts it
better<00:03:05.070> than<00:03:05.550> you<00:03:05.700> ever<00:03:05.910> could<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.360> that

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
better than you ever could and that

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.300 
better than you ever could and that
eliminates<00:03:07.260> a<00:03:07.440> lot<00:03:07.470> of<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.800> where<00:03:08.040> that's

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
eliminates a lot of the where that's

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.310 
eliminates a lot of the where that's
inherent<00:03:08.970> in<00:03:09.090> slipping<00:03:09.510> watches<00:03:09.900> well<00:03:10.290> I

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
inherent in slipping watches well I

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.140 
inherent in slipping watches well I
think<00:03:10.590> I<00:03:10.680> get<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:10.860> gist<00:03:11.100> of<00:03:11.310> it<00:03:11.460> now<00:03:11.700> thanks

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
think I get the gist of it now thanks
