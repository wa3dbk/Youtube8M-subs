looks pretty much the same thing just

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:52.889 
looks pretty much the same thing just
different<00:01:47.250> stuff<00:01:48.250> so<00:01:50.340> that's<00:01:51.340> about<00:01:51.459> it<00:01:51.899> and

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
she'll continue to see that the best way

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:02.460 
she'll continue to see that the best way
to<00:02:00.849> eat<00:02:01.000> is<00:02:01.299> to<00:02:01.569> accept<00:02:01.959> the<00:02:02.020> food<00:02:02.229> that<00:02:02.349> she's
