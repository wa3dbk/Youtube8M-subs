00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.370
 in the movie sam has one minute today 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.959
 we will talk about silicone implant 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.390
 even starting surgery as 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:18.369
 in which patients arrive 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:22.359
 apostolic many information knows where 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:24.880
 already sized shapes and the type of surgery 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.860
 that you have to ask some questions every time 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.480
 there and that's what we're going to try 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.880
 answer in this program what is the 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.190
 main music there is no doubt 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.500
 as for the boys boys I put 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.719
 occurs because today mothers are 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.700
 bringing daughters to count silicone 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:42.790
 and sometimes there are many young patients 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.860
 up to 15 years and hence panic comes to us 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.739
 always recommend that the person has a 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.840
 full development of the ideal 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.750
 would be 18 years old 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.670
 but after a year two of having mentioned the 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.110
 first time it is possible for people to 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.730
 put silicone 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.559
 so we rate a lot 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.500
 of the patient she has 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.579
 medication is hampering her 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.860
 class life 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.439
 People even pro can even put 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.079
 younger patients in the class sect 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:12.580
 save 18 is that women who 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:15.159
 wish to be mothers 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.350
 this will depend on the actuality 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.510
 patient is if she intends to be a mother 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.240
 within a year two years 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.950
 the ideal is to wait for his son 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.110
 after correcting his mother 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.070
 otherwise if this time was a 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.400
 men 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.830
 we need 4 years and 15 years federal 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.350
 that one day we call support the volume 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.390
 and the mana she'll get today 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.060
 have children with the result but 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.390
 because the silicone when placed 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.370
 on breast and body forum around and back 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.710
 silicone intense time 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.020
 It's not just any longer, it'll stay. 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.400
 with the volume of breast that probably 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.460
 After having a child, it's going to be just the 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.080
 silicone breast decreases advanced we 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.280
 for a longer period with a result 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.490
 good 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.500
 otherwise she already had her child 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.090
 tomorrow has already diminished in size since 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.520
 got leftover skin 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.100
 it will fix your breast once 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.380
 have a very good result 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.440
 after having children and there is still 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.490
 doubt cia attacks disrupts phone 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.770
 breast-feeding 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.640
 the silicone prosthesis it is placed 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.740
 behind the year or behind the musician then 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.690
 this phase nothing in food 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.650
 Amanda is all in front of the 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.650
 your territory 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.910
 your moment in a natural way and blocks 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.070
 in udinese 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.310
 the full of examples here is that the 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.500
 people have various forms and 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.920
 silicone that we have to profile 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.770
 super high to high profile and these are 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.250
 all textured ones too 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.260
 textured 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.810
 this one is already an exchange and profile 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.989
 anatomical it has the upper and 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.459
 the lower and the lower the volume 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.590
 it is indicated for very 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.690
 lean and want a better result 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.360
 discreet but that's what I ask you 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.340
 how do you define the size of the type of 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.300
 prosthesis that should be used by 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.700
 patient 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.410
 the type of prosthesis will be decided with the 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.739
 patient and according to the doctor 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:15.320
 most used is usually after the 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.660
 Don Quixote round movie because she 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.820
 fills all the people of the morning because 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.010
 usually what happens we have 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.120
 less attack filling 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.190
 top of the morning 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.100
 we want a volume on the lap of the 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.030
 mother and this practice does not give this volume 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.910
 Who's giving the name is for? 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.190
 don giovanni has been much talked about in 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.350
 prostheses that may leak in the 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.240
 I saw this a lot and nowadays 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.450
 that this issue of leaks 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:46.020
 the evidence is covered by three layers 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.300
 of coating then humans are 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.630
 very well made and the 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.900
 internal content of the prosthesis is a medical 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:58.440
 called discreet thing not school 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:01.200
 even if we were the prosthesis, this is 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.320
 gel he no more chain wanted everything 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.090
 together as if it were a routine and 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.690
 when how often need 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:13.830
 change the prosthesis if she has a 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.989
 validity time between quotation marks and 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.750
 come up with ten years we have been evaluated 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:21.090
 she is well the symptoms not having 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.610
 complications it can stay longer 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.070
 You reap she'll just change the silicone 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.400
 if she has any contractures 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.800
 capsular complications with this goal 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.090
 and I dealt with silicone it does not prevent 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.729
 no exam 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.130
 the next choice does not 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:41.460
 ultrasound can be done in photography 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:44.130
 perfect MRI radio 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.380
 Mammography is made a maneuver called 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.200
 of course we involve close 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.210
 side to see mother's plays 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.440
 Another concern of women is when 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.750
 breast cancer 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.060
 today already in the preoperative 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.400
 requests for breast imaging years 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:02.070
 from 30 years old because 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.169
 it was only after 40 years has 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.370
 appeared breast cancer each time the 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.890
 11 hours 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.080
 then with this prevention the patient 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.139
 You know, cole is quiet for a 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.539
 period of knowing 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:16.120
 his mother had no building to injury 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:18.520
 from there she will continue to do the 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.949
 your routine follow-up exams with 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.509
 the gynecologist 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:25.060
 according to the need of each house 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:27.789
 family history with another link 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.099
 problem in this preview that she comes 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:32.169
 it is important to note that with 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:34.840
 silicone placement every patient 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:37.629
 presents a type of result that will 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:41.199
 Depending on the skin type of position 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:43.750
 the size of it several differences 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:47.400
 within the patients the results of the 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:50.139
 ranking according to this body format 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.240
 It's not for everyone that you get a 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:54.219
 same result for example if I 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.560
 put a person who is shorter 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:58.900
 that I chubby intel and amd the same 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.789
 size the same fleet the effect it does not 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.949
 will be nothing to do with an effect that 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:04.930
 I had to know for sure. 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:07.479
 sometimes we get a patient who 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.849
 places the volume of for example your 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:12.939
 95 trips gets a lot done 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:15.520
 designed very apparent already a patient 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:18.310
 higher than that puts the athlete at 400 per 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.580
 example gets super natural result 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:23.490
 then this volume indication 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:26.370
 should be made by the physician- oriented 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.860
 always by doctor and patient europe 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:31.259
 between a greater or lesser volume there she 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.689
 will vary among the options that the most 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:36.780
 beautiful to present which is less than 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:39.689
 has chosen the volume these days. 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:44.400
 new evidence that is used around 200 

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:46.169
 220 and the largest largest tire around 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.930
 of the cars that have those exaggerations more 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:50.930
 so the larger search normally 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.930
 story
