00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.919
 this vacation I went to the beach 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.389
 but I had the mortification of the video 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.219
 today but what good that 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.929
 come back before to meet them so that 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.700
 see that I do not forget about you here 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.350
 I'm with a new video, in fact I'm going 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.180
 little delayed because at this time already 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.320
 the video should be on youtube but 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.320
 well let's heal 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.830
 I am samuel kunz and as we already know 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.690
 we are only a few days from the 30 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.340

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.230
 continue with cage so if I do not have 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.790
 children and they know that since all 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.160
 we have a child in Carlos 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.350
 pregnant behind and if we do not have children 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.900
 well we can have nephews grandchildren 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.850
 students friends and so on that's why 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.920
 thinking about the little ones I decided to do 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.950
 a tutorial to celebrate this day like this 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:04.670
 that today if today we are going to prepare choco 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.670
 bananas to win the cup the human fifa 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.880
 and good so you do not know a Cuban ax 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.000
 is 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.210
 banana 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.350
 with chocolate a banana 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.350
 with colate 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.030
 chocolate 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.400
 and we are also going to make other simple ones 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.330
 so stay with me so you can see 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.330
 what we are going to do 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:43.880
 we need ripe bananas 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.880
 for the way 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.510
 strawberries 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.360
 chocolates 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.920
 chocolate to melt this I bought it 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.960
 in a cereal store and it was coming 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.610
 melted otherwise you can buy 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.610
 the chocolate and melt it in a bain marie 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.200
 and sparks of colors 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.660
 in the well the bananas in the pgje in the 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.860
 bananas and cut them in half 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:22.730
 this way it will be easier to handle them 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.730
 disinfects strawberries very well 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.980
 in the land of the sticks in the bananas and 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.980
 in the strawberries 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.969
 do the same with chocolates 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.860
 I will also make banderillas with 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.990
 these three ingredients 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.510
 before covering chocolate you have to 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.640
 refrigerate the whole recommendation is that 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.500
 be frozen while cooler more 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.500
 the chocolate will soon harden 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.800
 since we refrigerate everything we start 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.190
 cover with chocolate 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.800
 Dip the banana in melted chocolate 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:17.770
 in this way wait a bit so that 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.770
 it is styled and add sparks of colors 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.349
 you do the same procedure with the 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.349
 strawberries and with chocolates 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:39.050
 It is super important to remember that 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.050
 ingredients must be very frozen 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.440
 I chose not to completely cover the 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.180
 chocolate banderillas 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.510
 in this way you will see the three 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.510
 ingredients 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.940
 and good guys this was all for the day 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.800
