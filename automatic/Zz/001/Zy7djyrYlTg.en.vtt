things over and this thing we did was

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.030 
things over and this thing we did was
roll<00:00:46.089> the<00:00:46.360> log<00:00:46.540> onto<00:00:46.870> the<00:00:47.170> carriage<00:00:47.620> and<00:00:47.829> then

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
roll the log onto the carriage and then

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.950 
roll the log onto the carriage and then
we<00:00:48.250> rolled<00:00:48.519> it<00:00:48.699> over<00:00:48.940> a<00:00:48.970> few<00:00:49.210> times<00:00:49.269> and<00:00:49.780> took<00:00:49.899> a

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
we rolled it over a few times and took a

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.170 
we rolled it over a few times and took a
look<00:00:50.170> at<00:00:50.379> it<00:00:50.530> and<00:00:50.680> ruled<00:00:51.040> the<00:00:51.280> heart<00:00:51.640> of<00:00:51.909> the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
look at it and ruled the heart of the

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.119 
look at it and ruled the heart of the
tree<00:00:52.449> as<00:00:52.659> close<00:00:52.899> to<00:00:53.110> the<00:00:53.229> dogs<00:00:53.500> as<00:00:53.800> we<00:00:53.949> could

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
tree as close to the dogs as we could

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.490 
tree as close to the dogs as we could
get<00:00:54.280> it<00:00:54.430> that<00:00:54.879> put<00:00:55.180> the<00:00:55.300> widest<00:00:55.899> piece<00:00:56.260> of

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
get it that put the widest piece of

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.330 
get it that put the widest piece of
material<00:00:56.649> out<00:00:57.160> towards<00:00:57.699> the<00:00:57.879> blade<00:00:59.039> then<00:01:00.039> we

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
material out towards the blade then we

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.459 
material out towards the blade then we
faced<00:01:00.670> it<00:01:00.940> a<00:01:00.969> few<00:01:01.239> times<00:01:01.510> until<00:01:01.809> we<00:01:02.050> got<00:01:02.170> a<00:01:02.230> good

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
faced it a few times until we got a good

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:05.070 
faced it a few times until we got a good
look<00:01:02.710> at<00:01:02.859> a<00:01:02.920> face<00:01:03.190> that<00:01:03.460> I<00:01:03.489> thought<00:01:03.820> was<00:01:04.080> proper

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
look at a face that I thought was proper

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.870 
look at a face that I thought was proper
for<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.500> timber<00:01:05.890> that<00:01:05.920> I<00:01:06.070> wanted<00:01:06.399> to<00:01:06.460> cut<00:01:06.700> for

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
for the timber that I wanted to cut for

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.330 
for the timber that I wanted to cut for
the<00:01:06.970> eight<00:01:07.090> meter<00:01:07.390> and<00:01:07.690> then<00:01:08.500> at<00:01:08.770> that<00:01:08.979> point

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
the eight meter and then at that point

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.370 
the eight meter and then at that point
we're<00:01:09.520> going<00:01:09.670> to<00:01:09.729> cut<00:01:09.910> a<00:01:09.940> six<00:01:10.420> by<00:01:10.690> off<00:01:11.050> of<00:01:11.229> it

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
we're going to cut a six by off of it

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.400 
we're going to cut a six by off of it
and<00:01:11.590> we<00:01:12.190> don't<00:01:12.369> cut<00:01:12.610> it<00:01:12.700> all<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:12.940> way<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:13.899> the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
and we don't cut it all the way to the

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.529 
and we don't cut it all the way to the
very<00:01:14.710> end<00:01:15.100> of<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.399> log<00:01:15.610> so<00:01:15.640> that<00:01:16.090> it<00:01:16.390> will

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
very end of the log so that it will

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:19.620 
very end of the log so that it will
return<00:01:16.780> back<00:01:17.140> to<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:18.039> deck<00:01:18.340> and<00:01:18.640> then<00:01:19.090> split

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
return back to the deck and then split

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.410 
return back to the deck and then split
it<00:01:19.780> off<00:01:19.990> and<00:01:20.259> drop<00:01:20.500> it<00:01:20.710> back<00:01:20.890> onto<00:01:21.190> the<00:01:21.369> deck<00:01:21.729> so

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
it off and drop it back onto the deck so

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.899 
it off and drop it back onto the deck so
it's<00:01:22.630> in<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:22.960> position<00:01:23.470> where<00:01:24.100> we<00:01:24.340> rolled<00:01:24.640> the

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
it's in the position where we rolled the

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.520 
it's in the position where we rolled the
log<00:01:25.119> up<00:01:25.420> to<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.690> carriage<00:01:26.050> in<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.200> first

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
log up to the carriage in the first

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.070 
log up to the carriage in the first
place<00:01:26.770> then<00:01:27.489> we're<00:01:27.610> going<00:01:27.789> to<00:01:27.880> take<00:01:28.330> a<00:01:28.569> fall

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
place then we're going to take a fall

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.380 
place then we're going to take a fall
buy<00:01:29.380> off<00:01:29.800> of<00:01:29.830> it<00:01:30.190> for<00:01:30.399> floor<00:01:30.729> timbers<00:01:31.179> and

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
buy off of it for floor timbers and

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.330 
buy off of it for floor timbers and
we're<00:01:32.110> going<00:01:32.229> to<00:01:32.259> have<00:01:32.410> floor<00:01:32.860> Timbers<00:01:33.190> on

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
we're going to have floor Timbers on

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.249 
we're going to have floor Timbers on
each<00:01:33.550> side<00:01:33.970> of<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.209> heart<00:01:34.509> that<00:01:34.660> four<00:01:35.050> bites

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
each side of the heart that four bites

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.290 
each side of the heart that four bites
cut<00:01:35.530> right<00:01:35.920> down<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.459> middle<00:01:36.489> of<00:01:36.789> the<00:01:36.910> timber

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
cut right down the middle of the timber

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.300 
cut right down the middle of the timber
with<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:37.569> hot<00:01:37.810> dead<00:01:38.229> center<00:01:38.679> in<00:01:38.800> the<00:01:38.830> fall<00:01:39.130> by

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
with the hot dead center in the fall by

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.770 
with the hot dead center in the fall by
so<00:01:39.580> I<00:01:39.610> can<00:01:39.759> get<00:01:39.910> floor<00:01:40.149> to<00:01:40.330> them<00:01:40.390> as<00:01:40.509> both<00:01:40.750> sides

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
so I can get floor to them as both sides

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.620 
so I can get floor to them as both sides
of<00:01:41.259> it<00:01:41.349> then<00:01:41.979> what's<00:01:42.250> remaining<00:01:42.700> will<00:01:43.270> be<00:01:43.300> the

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
of it then what's remaining will be the

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.139 
of it then what's remaining will be the
eight<00:01:43.780> by<00:01:44.050> then<00:01:44.739> we<00:01:44.860> just<00:01:45.069> simply<00:01:45.580> lay<00:01:45.940> the

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
eight by then we just simply lay the

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:47.999 
eight by then we just simply lay the
eight<00:01:46.300> by<00:01:46.569> down<00:01:46.929> on<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.259> carriage<00:01:47.649> and<00:01:47.800> edge

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
eight by down on the carriage and edge

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.219 
eight by down on the carriage and edge
it<00:01:48.280> on<00:01:48.429> both<00:01:48.640> edges<00:01:49.179> that's<00:01:49.599> quite<00:01:49.899> a<00:01:49.959> large

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
it on both edges that's quite a large

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.979 
it on both edges that's quite a large
piece<00:01:50.619> it's<00:01:50.920> actually<00:01:51.399> eight<00:01:51.610> inches<00:01:52.119> by<00:01:52.179> 15

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:52.989 
piece it's actually eight inches by 15

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:55.889 
piece it's actually eight inches by 15
inches<00:01:53.440> and<00:01:53.649> at<00:01:54.459> 18<00:01:54.940> feet<00:01:55.209> long<00:01:55.270> it's<00:01:55.660> quite<00:01:55.869> a

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
inches and at 18 feet long it's quite a

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.169 
inches and at 18 feet long it's quite a
large<00:01:56.170> piece<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:56.830> now<00:01:57.429> it's<00:01:57.580> going<00:01:57.729> to<00:01:57.759> be<00:01:57.879> put

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179

onto<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.720> truck<00:01:58.959> and<00:01:59.200> that<00:01:59.289> completes<00:01:59.950> the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
onto the truck and that completes the

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.500 
onto the truck and that completes the
cut<00:02:00.429> in<00:02:00.550> the<00:02:00.580> back<00:02:00.789> timber

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.870 

all<00:02:06.510> right<00:02:06.660> this<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:07.020> most<00:02:07.290> all<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:08.070> wood<00:02:08.850> that

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
all right this is most all the wood that

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.850 
all right this is most all the wood that
came<00:02:09.390> out<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.900> the<00:02:10.020> timber<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.530> we<00:02:10.650> had

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
came out of the timber that we had

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.830 
came out of the timber that we had
sewing<00:02:11.340> up<00:02:11.490> the<00:02:11.520> butt<00:02:11.910> end<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.390> timber<00:02:12.720> was

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
sewing up the butt end of the timber was

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.470 
sewing up the butt end of the timber was
down<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:13.800> and<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.460> forefoot<00:02:15.000> came<00:02:15.300> out

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
down that and and the forefoot came out

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.270 
down that and and the forefoot came out
of<00:02:15.630> this<00:02:15.720> larger<00:02:16.350> piece<00:02:16.560> right<00:02:16.860> here<00:02:17.100> this<00:02:17.220> is

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
of this larger piece right here this is

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.270 
of this larger piece right here this is
the<00:02:17.480> primary<00:02:18.480> focus<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.380> that<00:02:19.560> timber<00:02:19.800> was<00:02:20.070> to

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
the primary focus of that timber was to

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.100 
the primary focus of that timber was to
be<00:02:20.400> able<00:02:20.460> to<00:02:20.640> cut<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.000> fore<00:02:21.300> foot<00:02:21.570> out<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.810> that

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
be able to cut the fore foot out of that

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.840 
be able to cut the fore foot out of that
timber<00:02:22.380> this<00:02:22.770> particular<00:02:23.130> piece<00:02:23.580> right<00:02:23.790> here

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
timber this particular piece right here

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.060 
timber this particular piece right here
we<00:02:24.570> cut<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.900> fore<00:02:25.140> foot<00:02:25.380> out<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.590> this<00:02:25.800> piece

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
we cut the fore foot out of this piece

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.250 
we cut the fore foot out of this piece
and<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.820> butt<00:02:27.060> end<00:02:27.330> of<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.630> down<00:02:27.810> there<00:02:28.080> was

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
and the butt end of it down there was

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.900 
and the butt end of it down there was
the<00:02:28.410> widest<00:02:28.920> part<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.460> that's<00:02:29.640> where<00:02:29.820> I<00:02:29.850> took

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
the widest part and that's where I took

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.880 
the widest part and that's where I took
the<00:02:30.150> heel<00:02:30.390> into<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.780> fore<00:02:31.110> foot<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:31.800> the

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
the heel into the fore foot and the

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.860 
the heel into the fore foot and the
forward<00:02:32.400> into<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.700> fore<00:02:32.940> foot<00:02:33.180> came<00:02:33.420> up<00:02:33.720> in

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
forward into the fore foot came up in

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.170 
forward into the fore foot came up in
this<00:02:33.990> area<00:02:34.380> up<00:02:34.770> here<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:35.640> it's<00:02:35.820> a<00:02:35.880> fantastic

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
this area up here so it's a fantastic

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.660 
this area up here so it's a fantastic
piece<00:02:36.840> of<00:02:37.050> material<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.710> I'd<00:02:38.190> like<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.490> show

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
piece of material and I'd like to show

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.930 
piece of material and I'd like to show
you<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:39.000> end<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.530> piece<00:02:40.920> here<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.460> you

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
you the end of the piece here and you

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.550 
you the end of the piece here and you
can<00:02:42.090> see<00:02:42.300> here<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.750> annual<00:02:43.080> rings<00:02:43.410> are

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
can see here that the annual rings are

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.740 
can see here that the annual rings are
in<00:02:43.680> this<00:02:43.830> direction<00:02:44.040> here<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:45.030> hot<00:02:45.240> was<00:02:45.480> over

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
in this direction here the hot was over

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.720 
in this direction here the hot was over
here<00:02:45.960> so<00:02:46.170> it's<00:02:46.350> sawn<00:02:46.590> out<00:02:46.800> clear<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.520> heart

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
here so it's sawn out clear of the heart

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.280 
here so it's sawn out clear of the heart
because<00:02:48.120> they<00:02:48.210> didn't<00:02:48.510> want<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.810> have<00:02:49.050> any

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
because they didn't want it to have any

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.290 
because they didn't want it to have any
heart<00:02:49.680> or<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.070> center<00:02:50.520> of<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.820> tree<00:02:51.030> in<00:02:51.180> it

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
heart or the center of the tree in it

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.780 
heart or the center of the tree in it
now<00:02:51.420> this<00:02:51.600> particular<00:02:51.780> timber<00:02:52.590> was<00:02:52.740> cut<00:02:53.130> from

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
now this particular timber was cut from

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.820 
now this particular timber was cut from
one<00:02:53.850> side<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.630> heart<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.140> heart<00:02:55.350> was<00:02:55.530> over

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
one side of the heart the heart was over

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.890 
one side of the heart the heart was over
here<00:02:56.070> right<00:02:56.670> so<00:02:56.880> it's<00:02:57.030> clear<00:02:57.420> of<00:02:57.570> the<00:02:57.660> heart

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
here right so it's clear of the heart

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.650 
here right so it's clear of the heart
completely<00:02:58.350> instead<00:02:59.280> of<00:02:59.400> being<00:02:59.670> holding<00:03:00.510> the

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
completely instead of being holding the

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.300 
completely instead of being holding the
ha<00:03:00.810> in<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.230> center<00:03:01.650> which<00:03:01.800> would<00:03:01.950> be<00:03:02.100> called

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
ha in the center which would be called

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.260 
ha in the center which would be called
box<00:03:02.610> ha<00:03:02.940> this<00:03:03.450> is<00:03:03.630> clear<00:03:04.050> of<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.320> hot<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:05.270> it

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
box ha this is clear of the hot and it

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.680 
box ha this is clear of the hot and it
doesn't<00:03:07.190> open<00:03:08.190> up<00:03:08.370> on<00:03:08.610> its<00:03:08.820> medullary<00:03:09.390> raise<00:03:09.660> a

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
doesn't open up on its medullary raise a

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.949 
doesn't open up on its medullary raise a
shrink<00:03:10.350> or<00:03:10.530> contort<00:03:11.250> as<00:03:11.489> much<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.090> have

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
shrink or contort as much and have

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.680 
shrink or contort as much and have
problems<00:03:13.709> later<00:03:13.920> on<00:03:14.100> cracking<00:03:14.820> it'll<00:03:15.090> season

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
problems later on cracking it'll season

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.810 
problems later on cracking it'll season
and<00:03:15.930> not<00:03:16.440> give<00:03:16.650> me<00:03:16.680> problems<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:17.489> that's<00:03:17.580> why

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
and not give me problems and that's why

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
and not give me problems and that's why
I<00:03:17.850> wanted<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.239> do<00:03:18.390> it<00:03:18.450> because<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:18.690> is

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
I wanted to do it because it is

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.620 
I wanted to do it because it is
obviously<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:19.620> green<00:03:20.010> timber<00:03:20.610> that's<00:03:21.060> going<00:03:21.510> in

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
obviously a green timber that's going in

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.390 
obviously a green timber that's going in
there<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:21.870> that's<00:03:22.020> perfectly<00:03:22.470> acceptable

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
there and that's perfectly acceptable

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.640 
there and that's perfectly acceptable
so<00:03:23.910> I'm<00:03:24.000> sitting<00:03:24.270> here<00:03:24.570> at<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.810> broadest<00:03:25.320> part

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
so I'm sitting here at the broadest part

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.620 
so I'm sitting here at the broadest part
of<00:03:25.830> this<00:03:25.980> timber<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:26.520> this<00:03:26.640> is<00:03:26.820> where<00:03:27.120> the

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
of this timber and this is where the

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.870 
of this timber and this is where the
Kela<00:03:28.080> joins<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.920> forefoot<00:03:29.459> so<00:03:29.610> it's<00:03:29.760> got

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
Kela joins the forefoot so it's got

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.760 
Kela joins the forefoot so it's got
quite<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.150> depth<00:03:30.600> right<00:03:30.900> here<00:03:31.140> and<00:03:31.290> I<00:03:31.350> needed

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
quite a depth right here and I needed

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.949 
quite a depth right here and I needed
quite<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.010> bit<00:03:32.250> of<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.489> large<00:03:33.239> timber<00:03:33.660> to<00:03:33.750> get

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
quite a bit of a large timber to get

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.840 
quite a bit of a large timber to get
this<00:03:34.140> out<00:03:34.350> of<00:03:34.380> this<00:03:34.680> is<00:03:34.800> at<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.070> butt<00:03:35.340> end<00:03:35.640> of

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
this out of this is at the butt end of

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.910 
this out of this is at the butt end of
the<00:03:35.970> timber<00:03:36.330> whether<00:03:36.540> timber<00:03:37.350> is<00:03:37.440> so<00:03:37.590> very

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
the timber whether timber is so very

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.940 
the timber whether timber is so very
widest<00:03:38.670> obviously<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:40.260> heart<00:03:40.560> like<00:03:40.800> I

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
widest obviously and the heart like I

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.400 
widest obviously and the heart like I
said<00:03:41.190> was<00:03:41.370> over<00:03:41.670> here<00:03:42.030> so<00:03:42.630> I've<00:03:42.989> gotten<00:03:43.290> a

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
said was over here so I've gotten a

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.949 
said was over here so I've gotten a
cortisone<00:03:44.370> piece<00:03:44.790> right<00:03:45.269> through<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:45.810> middle

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
cortisone piece right through the middle

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.600 
cortisone piece right through the middle
of<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.260> tree<00:03:46.500> with<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.769> hot<00:03:46.980> in<00:03:47.280> it

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
of the tree with the hot in it

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.240 
of the tree with the hot in it
step<00:03:48.000> floor<00:03:48.239> Tim<00:03:48.450> was<00:03:48.600> on<00:03:48.720> both<00:03:48.930> sides<00:03:49.230> that<00:03:49.920> is

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
step floor Tim was on both sides that is

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.090 
step floor Tim was on both sides that is
a<00:03:50.580> natural<00:03:51.450> sweep<00:03:51.840> that<00:03:52.080> was<00:03:52.260> in<00:03:52.410> the<00:03:52.530> log<00:03:52.739> to<00:03:53.070> a

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
a natural sweep that was in the log to a

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.030 
a natural sweep that was in the log to a
certain<00:03:53.519> extent<00:03:53.970> and<00:03:54.150> I<00:03:54.930> followed<00:03:55.500> that<00:03:55.739> and

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
certain extent and I followed that and

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.460 
certain extent and I followed that and
obviously<00:03:56.160> I've<00:03:56.940> kept<00:03:57.480> it<00:03:57.600> outside<00:03:58.050> too<00:03:58.260> hot

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
obviously I've kept it outside too hot

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.890 
obviously I've kept it outside too hot
all<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:58.769> way<00:03:59.010> up<00:03:59.370> because<00:03:59.760> the<00:04:00.269> diameter<00:04:00.870> of

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
all the way up because the diameter of

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.479 
all the way up because the diameter of
the<00:04:01.019> tree<00:04:01.260> wasn't<00:04:01.470> quite<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:01.920> same<00:04:02.100> up<00:04:02.370> the

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
the tree wasn't quite the same up the

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.340 
the tree wasn't quite the same up the
top<00:04:02.760> as<00:04:02.940> it<00:04:03.060> is<00:04:03.180> down<00:04:03.390> here<00:04:03.690> so<00:04:03.930> we've

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
top as it is down here so we've

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.830 
top as it is down here so we've
positioned<00:04:04.620> this<00:04:05.250> thing<00:04:05.550> in<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.880> log<00:04:06.090> by

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
positioned this thing in the log by

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.050 
positioned this thing in the log by
pattern<00:04:07.410> and<00:04:07.620> rolled<00:04:07.980> that<00:04:08.250> log<00:04:08.580> and<00:04:08.850> looked

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
pattern and rolled that log and looked

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.030 
pattern and rolled that log and looked
at<00:04:09.209> it<00:04:09.360> and<00:04:09.480> got<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:09.630> best<00:04:10.019> face<00:04:10.380> of<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:10.800> log

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
at it and got the best face of the log

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.580 
at it and got the best face of the log
so<00:04:11.940> that<00:04:11.970> this<00:04:12.300> timber<00:04:12.569> could<00:04:12.840> be<00:04:12.960> sawn

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
so that this timber could be sawn

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.220 
so that this timber could be sawn
outside<00:04:14.460> the<00:04:14.700> heart<00:04:14.910> completely

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
outside the heart completely

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.010 
outside the heart completely
so<00:04:16.440> this<00:04:16.620> is<00:04:16.800> the<00:04:16.950> forward<00:04:17.340> end<00:04:17.850> and<00:04:18.240> I<00:04:18.600> did

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
so this is the forward end and I did

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.140 
so this is the forward end and I did
rough<00:04:19.380> it<00:04:19.560> out<00:04:19.710> of<00:04:20.070> their<00:04:20.250> timber<00:04:20.910> with<00:04:21.120> a

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
rough it out of their timber with a

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.600 
rough it out of their timber with a
chainsaw<00:04:21.600> and<00:04:22.230> then<00:04:22.800> I<00:04:22.920> put<00:04:23.190> it<00:04:23.280> through<00:04:23.460> the

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
chainsaw and then I put it through the

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.780 
chainsaw and then I put it through the
bandsaw<00:04:24.120> to<00:04:24.330> cut<00:04:24.420> the<00:04:24.720> profile<00:04:25.320> in<00:04:25.590> it<00:04:25.790> the

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
bandsaw to cut the profile in it the

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.970 
bandsaw to cut the profile in it the
forward<00:04:27.300> profile<00:04:27.780> as<00:04:27.990> well<00:04:28.140> as<00:04:28.380> the<00:04:28.530> profile

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
forward profile as well as the profile

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.160 
forward profile as well as the profile
up<00:04:29.190> inside<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.730> boat<00:04:29.910> here<00:04:30.210> and<00:04:30.390> then<00:04:31.050> I

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
up inside the boat here and then I

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.510 
up inside the boat here and then I
actually<00:04:31.350> ran<00:04:31.740> it<00:04:31.860> through<00:04:32.040> the<00:04:32.100> other<00:04:32.310> way

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
actually ran it through the other way

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.030 
actually ran it through the other way
taping<00:04:33.090> it<00:04:33.180> in<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.810> bandsaw<00:04:34.290> because<00:04:34.590> of<00:04:34.740> six

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
taping it in the bandsaw because of six

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.190 
taping it in the bandsaw because of six
inches<00:04:35.280> broad<00:04:35.760> on<00:04:35.970> this<00:04:36.150> end<00:04:36.390> and<00:04:36.630> seven<00:04:36.990> and<00:04:37.110> a

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
inches broad on this end and seven and a

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.610 
inches broad on this end and seven and a
half<00:04:37.380> inches<00:04:37.800> across<00:04:38.580> on<00:04:38.820> a<00:04:39.050> stern<00:04:40.050> end<00:04:40.320> of<00:04:40.470> it

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
half inches across on a stern end of it

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.440 
half inches across on a stern end of it
this<00:04:40.800> so<00:04:41.250> now<00:04:41.430> you<00:04:41.490> can<00:04:41.790> see<00:04:41.970> here<00:04:42.180> that<00:04:42.300> the

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
this so now you can see here that the

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.660 
this so now you can see here that the
rabbit<00:04:42.870> has<00:04:43.050> been<00:04:43.260> cut<00:04:43.530> out<00:04:43.770> of<00:04:44.040> it<00:04:44.220> and<00:04:44.370> the

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
rabbit has been cut out of it and the

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.090 
rabbit has been cut out of it and the
biddin<00:04:45.030> line<00:04:45.240> is<00:04:45.450> plotted<00:04:45.750> on<00:04:46.140> the<00:04:46.350> width<00:04:46.980> of

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
biddin line is plotted on the width of

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.610 
biddin line is plotted on the width of
the<00:04:47.250> stock<00:04:47.580> here<00:04:47.880> and<00:04:48.120> the<00:04:48.690> rabbit<00:04:49.440> line

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
the stock here and the rabbit line

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.590 
the stock here and the rabbit line
itself<00:04:50.040> is<00:04:50.220> plotted<00:04:50.700> on<00:04:50.820> a<00:04:50.850> plane<00:04:51.240> that's<00:04:51.450> a

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
itself is plotted on a plane that's a

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.840 
itself is plotted on a plane that's a
little<00:04:51.840> bit<00:04:51.960> narrower<00:04:52.260> and<00:04:52.770> then<00:04:53.430> this<00:04:53.550> is<00:04:53.730> the

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
little bit narrower and then this is the

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.730 
little bit narrower and then this is the
inside<00:04:54.240> rabbit<00:04:54.660> line<00:04:54.780> so<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:55.050> planking<00:04:55.380> lays

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
inside rabbit line so the planking lays

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.380 
inside rabbit line so the planking lays
in<00:04:56.070> there<00:04:56.310> and<00:04:56.460> an<00:04:56.520> angle<00:04:56.820> like<00:04:56.910> just<00:04:57.150> kind<00:04:57.330> of

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
in there and an angle like just kind of

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.210 
in there and an angle like just kind of
coming<00:04:57.780> in<00:04:57.900> like<00:04:58.110> this<00:04:58.290> and<00:04:58.350> an<00:04:58.650> angle<00:04:59.010> course

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
coming in like this and an angle course

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.700 
coming in like this and an angle course
this<00:04:59.400> is<00:04:59.580> upside<00:05:00.030> down<00:05:00.060> here<00:05:00.660> as<00:05:00.810> we<00:05:01.290> look<00:05:01.320> at

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
this is upside down here as we look at

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.360 
this is upside down here as we look at
it<00:05:01.890> and<00:05:02.040> you<00:05:02.940> can<00:05:02.970> see<00:05:03.330> that<00:05:03.600> this<00:05:03.990> is<00:05:04.350> set<00:05:05.130> over

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
it and you can see that this is set over

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.060 
it and you can see that this is set over
from<00:05:05.880> this<00:05:06.120> so<00:05:06.360> the<00:05:06.540> biddin<00:05:07.290> line<00:05:07.530> is<00:05:07.800> plotted

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
from this so the biddin line is plotted

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.920 
from this so the biddin line is plotted
on<00:05:08.400> one<00:05:08.700> width<00:05:09.000> and<00:05:09.240> the<00:05:09.300> rabbit<00:05:09.630> line<00:05:09.750> is

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
on one width and the rabbit line is

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.510 
on one width and the rabbit line is
plotted<00:05:10.140> on<00:05:10.440> another<00:05:10.710> which<00:05:10.920> makes<00:05:11.160> a<00:05:11.280> little

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
plotted on another which makes a little

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.350 
plotted on another which makes a little
complex<00:05:12.000> it's<00:05:12.690> a<00:05:13.080> European<00:05:13.710> style<00:05:14.520> and<00:05:14.910> it

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
complex it's a European style and it

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.110 
complex it's a European style and it
increases<00:05:15.870> the<00:05:16.440> Baron<00:05:16.950> of<00:05:17.100> the<00:05:17.190> planking<00:05:17.970> on

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
increases the Baron of the planking on

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.450 
increases the Baron of the planking on
here<00:05:18.420> by<00:05:18.630> the<00:05:19.290> distance<00:05:19.830> that<00:05:20.070> this<00:05:20.250> is

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
here by the distance that this is

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.250

deducted<00:05:21.000> by<00:05:21.120> seven<00:05:21.540> eighths<00:05:21.690> of<00:05:21.840> an<00:05:21.990> inch<00:05:22.080> so

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
deducted by seven eighths of an inch so

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.930 
deducted by seven eighths of an inch so
it's<00:05:22.380> got<00:05:22.500> a<00:05:22.530> deeper<00:05:23.040> rabbet<00:05:23.520> than<00:05:23.670> it<00:05:23.760> would

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
it's got a deeper rabbet than it would

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.700 
it's got a deeper rabbet than it would
have<00:05:23.970> if<00:05:24.480> it<00:05:24.630> was<00:05:24.780> probably<00:05:25.230> made<00:05:25.500> in<00:05:25.530> the

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
have if it was probably made in the

have if it was probably made in the
United<00:05:26.160> States<00:05:26.520> so<00:05:27.090> it's<00:05:27.210> been<00:05:27.390> all<00:05:27.600> whittled

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990

these corner cuts home with me because

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.230 
these corner cuts home with me because
they've<00:05:48.600> perfect<00:05:49.440> wood<00:05:49.920> for<00:05:50.220> getting<00:05:50.520> bent

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
they've perfect wood for getting bent

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.630 
they've perfect wood for getting bent
framing<00:05:51.840> out<00:05:51.990> of<00:05:52.140> a<00:05:52.320> small<00:05:52.680> boat<00:05:52.920> because<00:05:53.490> I

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
framing out of a small boat because I

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.270 
framing out of a small boat because I
can<00:05:53.820> get<00:05:53.970> very<00:05:54.360> nice<00:05:54.750> slabs<00:05:55.260> on<00:05:55.620> material

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
can get very nice slabs on material

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.280 
can get very nice slabs on material
right<00:05:56.490> out<00:05:56.670> of<00:05:56.820> here<00:05:57.060> and<00:05:57.270> then<00:05:57.750> cut<00:05:58.020> it<00:05:58.050> up

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.290 
right out of here and then cut it up

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.770 
right out of here and then cut it up
into<00:05:58.470> squares<00:05:58.800> to<00:05:59.250> make<00:05:59.280> bent<00:06:00.060> framing<00:06:00.600> for

into squares to make bent framing for
small<00:06:01.530> boats<00:06:01.800> because<00:06:02.280> this<00:06:02.460> is<00:06:02.640> the<00:06:02.790> most
