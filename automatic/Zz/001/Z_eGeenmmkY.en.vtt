00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.390 
automatic landing yeah don't don't hand
anything<00:03:45.719> to<00:03:45.959> me<00:03:46.079> I'm<00:03:46.200> I'm<00:03:46.859> very<00:03:46.920> conscious

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
anything to me I'm I'm very conscious

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.849 
anything to me I'm I'm very conscious
the<00:03:47.609> fact<00:03:47.790> we<00:03:47.849> got<00:03:47.969> passengers<00:03:48.329> here<00:03:48.659> and<00:03:49.469> in

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
the fact we got passengers here and in

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.949 
the fact we got passengers here and in
anticipation<00:03:50.670> of<00:03:50.939> that<00:03:51.150> I've<00:03:51.329> just<00:03:51.569> put<00:03:51.810> in

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
anticipation of that I've just put in

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.410 
anticipation of that I've just put in
the<00:03:52.140> approach<00:03:52.530> so<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.519> simulator<00:03:53.939> obviously

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
the approach so the simulator obviously

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.789 
the approach so the simulator obviously
when<00:03:54.569> they're<00:03:54.689> being<00:03:54.810> assessed<00:03:54.989> will<00:03:55.500> throw

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
when they're being assessed will throw

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.199 
when they're being assessed will throw
up<00:03:55.950> different<00:03:56.340> weather<00:03:56.519> conditions<00:03:57.090> what

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
up different weather conditions what

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.210 
up different weather conditions what
kind<00:03:57.269> of<00:03:57.599> weather<00:03:57.780> conditions<00:03:57.989> some<00:03:58.980> of<00:03:59.010> our

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
kind of weather conditions some of our

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.220 
kind of weather conditions some of our
models<00:03:59.640> have<00:03:59.849> what<00:04:00.060> are<00:04:00.180> called<00:04:00.209> snow<00:04:00.750> models

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
models have what are called snow models

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.789 
models have what are called snow models
so<00:04:01.950> a<00:04:02.670> couple<00:04:03.480> of<00:04:03.629> spring<00:04:03.959> to<00:04:04.109> mind

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
so a couple of spring to mind

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.360 
so a couple of spring to mind
London<00:04:05.310> Heathrow<00:04:06.139> narrator<00:04:07.139> in<00:04:07.379> Japan<00:04:07.799> and

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
London Heathrow narrator in Japan and

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.369 
London Heathrow narrator in Japan and
they<00:04:08.609> you<00:04:08.939> can<00:04:09.090> actually<00:04:09.239> put<00:04:09.629> snow<00:04:09.870> and<00:04:10.290> the

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
they you can actually put snow and the

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.319 
they you can actually put snow and the
snow<00:04:10.439> on<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:10.829> ground<00:04:11.040> and<00:04:11.310> snow<00:04:11.519> falling<00:04:12.060> yeah

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
snow on the ground and snow falling yeah

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.729 
snow on the ground and snow falling yeah
so<00:04:12.780> it's<00:04:13.109> it's<00:04:13.459> quite<00:04:14.459> a<00:04:14.489> fitting<00:04:14.790> is

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
so it's it's quite a fitting is

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.820 
so it's it's quite a fitting is
well<00:04:16.739> this<00:04:17.400> is<00:04:17.580> a<00:04:17.610> site<00:04:18.000> that<00:04:18.650> somebody<00:04:19.650> let

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
well this is a site that somebody let

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.650 
well this is a site that somebody let
myself<00:04:19.980> never<00:04:20.400> gets<00:04:20.700> to<00:04:20.850> see<00:04:20.880> sitting<00:04:21.390> in<00:04:21.570> the

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
myself never gets to see sitting in the

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.890 
myself never gets to see sitting in the
back<00:04:21.840> in<00:04:22.049> those<00:04:22.200> comfortable<00:04:22.680> seat<00:04:22.890> I<00:04:23.340> have<00:04:24.330> no

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
back in those comfortable seat I have no

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.960 
back in those comfortable seat I have no
idea<00:04:25.380> what<00:04:25.590> they<00:04:25.710> approached<00:04:26.040> to<00:04:26.340> Hong<00:04:26.730> Kong

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
idea what they approached to Hong Kong

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.730 
idea what they approached to Hong Kong
Airport<00:04:27.210> and<00:04:27.960> looked<00:04:28.170> like<00:04:28.260> well<00:04:28.620> actually

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
Airport and looked like well actually

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.800 
Airport and looked like well actually
when<00:04:29.190> you<00:04:29.280> look<00:04:29.430> at<00:04:29.580> it<00:04:29.700> now<00:04:29.730> there<00:04:30.540> are<00:04:30.660> two

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
when you look at it now there are two

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.430 
when you look at it now there are two
runways<00:04:31.080> and<00:04:31.910> it<00:04:32.910> seem<00:04:33.090> to<00:04:33.210> be<00:04:33.330> set<00:04:33.570> on<00:04:33.780> a<00:04:33.840> strip

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
runways and it seem to be set on a strip

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.410 
runways and it seem to be set on a strip
of<00:04:34.590> land<00:04:34.830> which<00:04:35.160> is<00:04:35.750> surrounded<00:04:36.750> by<00:04:36.780> the<00:04:36.870> sea

yeah<00:04:39.420> the<00:04:39.660> original<00:04:40.070> Ireland<00:04:41.070> was<00:04:41.400> only<00:04:41.670> quite

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
yeah the original Ireland was only quite

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:50.630 
yeah the original Ireland was only quite
small<00:04:42.240> build<00:04:43.080> up<00:04:43.580> by<00:04:44.600> reclamation<00:04:48.980> 1540<00:04:49.980> old

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
small build up by reclamation 1540 old

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.920 
small build up by reclamation 1540 old
early<00:04:50.940> early<00:04:51.420> era<00:04:51.570> want<00:04:51.840> a<00:04:51.960> flair<00:04:52.290> and

exactly what you feel when you're
sitting<00:05:04.860> in<00:05:04.950> the<00:05:05.040> base<00:05:05.190> and<00:05:05.340> I'm<00:05:05.700> just<00:05:05.940> pulling

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
sitting in the base and I'm just pulling

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.630 
sitting in the base and I'm just pulling
in<00:05:06.360> reverse<00:05:06.690> thrust<00:05:07.080> now<00:05:07.320> over<00:05:08.310> when<00:05:08.430> I<00:05:08.520> was

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
in reverse thrust now over when I was

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.900 
in reverse thrust now over when I was
slowing<00:05:08.880> that<00:05:10.010> it's<00:05:11.010> thrown<00:05:11.280> forward<00:05:11.580> that<00:05:11.820> my

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
slowing that it's thrown forward that my

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.390 
slowing that it's thrown forward that my
scene<00:05:12.420> here<00:05:12.450> with<00:05:12.720> my<00:05:12.870> seagull<00:05:13.200> on<00:05:13.380> obviously

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
scene here with my seagull on obviously

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.600 
scene here with my seagull on obviously
life<00:05:16.090> we've<00:05:16.509> released<00:05:16.900> the<00:05:17.139> auto<00:05:17.800> breaks<00:05:18.280> now

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
life we've released the auto breaks now

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.689 
life we've released the auto breaks now
and<00:05:19.060> go<00:05:19.180> to<00:05:19.240> manual<00:05:19.660> braking<00:05:20.130> so<00:05:21.130> I'm<00:05:21.520> just

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:21.699 
and go to manual braking so I'm just

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:24.510 
and go to manual braking so I'm just
gonna<00:05:21.820> let<00:05:22.030> Jeff<00:05:22.419> take<00:05:22.600> us<00:05:22.900> back<00:05:23.139> to<00:05:23.440> the<00:05:24.400> place

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
gonna let Jeff take us back to the place

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.580 
gonna let Jeff take us back to the place
that<00:05:24.669> we're<00:05:24.820> going<00:05:24.970> to<00:05:25.060> get<00:05:25.150> off<00:05:25.470> that<00:05:26.470> was

it felt or I imagine real feels like

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.350 
it felt or I imagine real feels like
obviously<00:05:32.710> I've<00:05:32.800> never<00:05:32.830> flown<00:05:33.400> a<00:05:33.460> plane<00:05:33.639> it
