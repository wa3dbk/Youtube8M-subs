 i this with the pama take advantage of it use some layers not 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.120

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.030
 has a local mouth has the shape of eads put some favorites 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.110
 certainly some some highlights that the application recommends and for 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.170

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.730
 percent in this tab the most popular village are 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.230
 from the most popular layers that can be used 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.380
 for the image that we are seeing how to take advantage of a little 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.420
 percent for example or how to take panoramio northern min beings 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.350

 and that can be displayed in google earth and google maps not then 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.710
 let's see the panorama and he will allow us to open the field 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.350
 the fall in the camera of course watching 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.150
 at that time the phone is looking good gps were at the 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.610
 location where is 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.109
 if right up to the right they will see 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:38.400
 a lot of white dots 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.720
 the teachers all their white spots are the ones who are striking are to 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.580
 Around us 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.150
 what of our location 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.520
 what is k is not showing and all the sayings of panoramio just 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.980
 all the points where there are photos 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:58.150
 if I love you a little since I'm looking at the camera and like this again 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.880
 lost points remain on the site I did not think I would be each 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.560
 how not to open the barqueta 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.269
 this this photo highlights below 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.989
 that shows me just 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.309
 but just the subway 

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:21.989
 percent on the stairs of the tea park east metro now I call 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.969
 Miranda here in Caracas 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:25.709
 efe we ​​can 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.049
 take this point of rolfo all the details the photo good the author 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.789
 just the author of the photo that the panorama rise 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:36.549
 we can simply reverse the process of 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.930
 of him just looking at him from the we're going to see if he can move the guys 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.869
 a little pepper 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:49.039
 you see in the points that remain in your site because they are loan points 

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:53.729
 josé voucher the fans of all this is that we have them any of them 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:57.229
 shows us the detail that went down in question says college of 

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:59.299
 Caracas that is pretty close to 15 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.379
 it does not have to be necessarily 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.839
 per cent what we are seeing in the image 

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:07.249
 just simply the points closest to the position where no 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:08.039
 we find 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:13.599
 the radar in 75 mm indicates a range of we can set it 800 meters as 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.579
 we can download it 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:22.479
 percent 150 banon here make a 10 2 percent percent just to take 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:26.459
 together for those who are located in the departments of st 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.329
 then it appears that larger than the one that is handled much closer to 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.349
 we 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.669
 the set pretty close 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:38.769
 after exhibiting terrace of the hotel pestana and of course if we look at the image 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.819
 by the way is that a river where is the building that they promised to follow 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:45.949
 the hotel tab 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:50.239
 in this municipality to what the fall the one that appears in the wikipedia 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.660
 and one of the best things of what 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.360
 remember that this equipment is already in a digital compass which brings in a 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.070
 digital compass that's already we've seen it on computer like the iphone3gs by 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.800
 example but just as you have much more time in the market and leandro and has 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.179
 developed quite well these new functions allows us to take effect 

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:13.549
 that of course they get to know a little more about this kind of thing by the 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:14.939
 accelerometer 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:17.310
 Hiroshi is comprised of the digital classroom 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.629
 allows us to use believes what we call restrictive 

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:24.129
 this link here in venezuela of course we do not have it 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:28.800
 think that with the help of the thinning raindrop lengthener allows us to 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.590
 vain to consult some more points for example you have to go to the wikipedia 

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:33.860
 that is floating 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.309
 efe just this point if we click on it 

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:40.779
 percent down should not showed any information tells us what 

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:43.050
 distance to that point 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.969
 since it will be one points the km 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:49.139
 giving us moral training unfolding give more details 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.060
 now for example you can know whether or not the state can not show it 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:00.499
 if some tweeters cd appear 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.169
 Since he says goodbye to them with blue dots 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.940
 be loading the avatars of a year we appear swamp 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.179
 we seemed to follow carefully what you have to kill closely 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.849
 thanks to a gps 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:22.849
 says down 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:27.990
 from below from the beginning in which he has launched this personal income 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.199
 we're not going to grab a little rotate 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.040
 but I think we're going to try and see if we can open the ears 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:47.110
 I thought 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.129
 by team of elms but the tuy 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:53.129
 from that person time without hesitating good to great 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:56.389
 fusion prd lives here 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:59.389
 d the urban wolf 

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:05.169
 this career remembered woman this layer of twitter what are you looking for are twitter 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:10.279
 close to my position that have been reported zambrano of possession a text 

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:12.119
 john the assembly members 

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:15.739
 st by the way two will be chosen 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:20.839
 but here the care of the person 

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:23.839
 we are going to see him 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.710
 press 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.479
 they are all 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:32.879
 let's not make this flight is so useless 

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:34.990
 but we can not report 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.990
 state 300 meters 

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:42.189
 we wanted to make a small sample of what actually augmented thanks to 

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:43.680
 aid 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.249
 It is not like this 

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:48.249
 we can capture those who started 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:52.009
 share the costs 

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:55.919
