00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.570 

I<00:00:05.180> think<00:00:06.080> the<00:00:06.140> recharge<00:00:06.530> is<00:00:06.680> about<00:00:06.860> 15<00:00:07.370> minutes

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:07.580 
I think the recharge is about 15 minutes

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.690 
I think the recharge is about 15 minutes
or<00:00:07.880> so<00:00:08.120> and<00:00:08.870> you<00:00:09.590> know<00:00:09.650> that's<00:00:09.950> 15<00:00:10.340> minutes<00:00:10.490> of

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.700 
or so and you know that's 15 minutes of

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.700 
or so and you know that's 15 minutes of
downtime<00:00:11.059> for<00:00:11.300> us<00:00:11.389> so<00:00:11.719> I<00:00:12.020> don't<00:00:12.410> think<00:00:12.590> we've

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:12.710 
downtime for us so I don't think we've

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.700 
downtime for us so I don't think we've
put<00:00:13.100> more<00:00:14.000> than<00:00:14.120> two<00:00:14.240> cells<00:00:14.510> of<00:00:14.750> fuel<00:00:15.410> in<00:00:15.559> it

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:15.710 
put more than two cells of fuel in it

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.650 
put more than two cells of fuel in it
yet<00:00:15.890> we<00:00:16.460> put<00:00:16.640> a<00:00:16.700> lot<00:00:16.849> of<00:00:16.910> nail<00:00:17.060> in<00:00:17.270> with<00:00:17.390> it<00:00:17.540> hey

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
yet we put a lot of nail in with it hey

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.910 
yet we put a lot of nail in with it hey

little stuff let's talk about the
performance<00:01:31.580> as<00:01:32.119> regards<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:33.080> fuel<00:01:33.349> cell<00:01:33.649> and

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
performance as regards the fuel cell and

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.620 
performance as regards the fuel cell and
the<00:01:34.099> battery<00:01:34.520> I<00:01:34.610> mean<00:01:34.849> that's<00:01:35.030> an<00:01:35.240> interesting

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
the battery I mean that's an interesting

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.839 
the battery I mean that's an interesting
arrangement<00:01:36.140> isn't<00:01:36.259> it<00:01:36.380> oh<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.979> battery<00:01:37.160> is

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:37.849 
arrangement isn't it oh the battery is

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:40.480 
arrangement isn't it oh the battery is
pretty<00:01:38.539> nice<00:01:38.660> they've<00:01:39.560> redesigned<00:01:39.890> it<00:01:40.310> so

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
pretty nice they've redesigned it so

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.040 
pretty nice they've redesigned it so
that<00:01:40.640> you<00:01:40.849> can<00:01:40.970> actually<00:01:41.149> turn<00:01:41.450> it<00:01:41.599> off<00:01:41.750> used

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
that you can actually turn it off used

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.449 
that you can actually turn it off used
to<00:01:42.140> be<00:01:42.200> you<00:01:42.319> had<00:01:42.470> to<00:01:42.500> take<00:01:42.770> it<00:01:42.830> take<00:01:43.399> the

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:43.459 
to be you had to take it take the

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:45.309 
to be you had to take it take the
battery<00:01:43.819> completely<00:01:44.090> out<00:01:44.479> in<00:01:44.810> order<00:01:44.990> to<00:01:45.110> make

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
battery completely out in order to make

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:48.279 
battery completely out in order to make
it<00:01:45.640> shut<00:01:46.640> off<00:01:46.670> but<00:01:47.209> now<00:01:47.780> they<00:01:47.959> got<00:01:48.080> a<00:01:48.110> little

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
it shut off but now they got a little

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.680 
it shut off but now they got a little
off<00:01:48.800> position<00:01:49.429> so<00:01:49.759> the<00:01:49.849> battery<00:01:50.090> stays<00:01:50.330> in<00:01:50.539> it

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
off position so the battery stays in it

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.320 
off position so the battery stays in it
so<00:01:50.780> you<00:01:50.869> never<00:01:50.989> lose<00:01:51.229> it<00:01:51.470> and<00:01:52.039> the<00:01:52.910> fuel<00:01:53.119> cell

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
so you never lose it and the fuel cell

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.699 
so you never lose it and the fuel cell
goes<00:01:53.690> in<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:53.899> back<00:01:54.080> which<00:01:54.349> they've

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:54.709 
goes in the back which they've

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:57.570 
goes in the back which they've
redesigned<00:01:54.979> that<00:01:55.369> also<00:01:55.580> it<00:01:56.539> used<00:01:56.869> to<00:01:57.050> have<00:01:57.289> a

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
redesigned that also it used to have a

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.800 
redesigned that also it used to have a
different<00:01:58.580> cap<00:01:58.759> you<00:01:58.940> had<00:01:59.060> to<00:01:59.179> snap<00:01:59.420> into<00:01:59.720> the

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
different cap you had to snap into the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.440 
different cap you had to snap into the
fuel<00:02:00.020> cell<00:02:00.229> but<00:02:00.530> now<00:02:00.770> it's<00:02:01.310> just<00:02:01.550> it's<00:02:02.300> all

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
fuel cell but now it's just it's all

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.529 
fuel cell but now it's just it's all
built<00:02:02.690> into<00:02:02.899> the<00:02:03.020> gun<00:02:03.259> itself<00:02:04.270> and<00:02:05.270> it<00:02:05.360> seems

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
built into the gun itself and it seems

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.479 
built into the gun itself and it seems
to<00:02:05.690> hold<00:02:05.840> up<00:02:05.959> pretty<00:02:06.170> long<00:02:06.349> I<00:02:06.950> don't<00:02:07.310> think

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 
to hold up pretty long I don't think

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:10.479 
to hold up pretty long I don't think
we've<00:02:07.640> put<00:02:08.030> more<00:02:08.929> than<00:02:09.020> two<00:02:09.170> cells<00:02:09.440> of<00:02:09.679> fuel<00:02:10.340> in

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
we've put more than two cells of fuel in

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.309 
we've put more than two cells of fuel in
it<00:02:10.610> yet<00:02:10.789> and<00:02:10.970> we<00:02:11.209> put<00:02:11.569> a<00:02:11.599> lot<00:02:11.720> of<00:02:11.810> nails<00:02:11.989> in<00:02:12.140> with

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
it yet and we put a lot of nails in with

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.559 
it yet and we put a lot of nails in with
it<00:02:12.470> so<00:02:12.650> it's<00:02:13.280> also<00:02:13.430> got<00:02:13.700> this<00:02:13.879> nice<00:02:14.120> grip<00:02:14.420> on

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
it so it's also got this nice grip on

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.080 
it so it's also got this nice grip on
the<00:02:14.719> end<00:02:14.870> for<00:02:15.230> toenail<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:15.829> which<00:02:16.459> really

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
the end for toenail and which really

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.620 
the end for toenail and which really
works<00:02:17.420> it<00:02:17.659> digs<00:02:17.900> right<00:02:17.989> into<00:02:18.349> the<00:02:18.439> wood

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
works it digs right into the wood

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.260 
works it digs right into the wood
you<00:02:19.560> get<00:02:19.710> a<00:02:19.740> good<00:02:19.890> angle<00:02:20.130> on<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:20.730> sure<00:02:21.090> you

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
you get a good angle on it so sure you

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.340 
you get a good angle on it so sure you
can<00:02:21.390> change<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.690> depth<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:22.020> driver

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
can change the depth of driver

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.110 
can change the depth of driver
yep<00:02:22.470> depth<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.890> drive<00:02:23.130> for<00:02:23.340> if<00:02:23.460> you<00:02:23.880> know<00:02:24.000> on

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
yep depth the drive for if you know on

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.670 
yep depth the drive for if you know on
set<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.480> nice<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:24.960> deep<00:02:25.260> for<00:02:25.500> if<00:02:25.560> you're

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
set it nice and deep for if you're

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.040 
set it nice and deep for if you're
shooting<00:02:25.860> lvls<00:02:26.340> together<00:02:26.700> or<00:02:27.030> or<00:02:27.450> Chell<00:02:27.810> or<00:02:27.990> if

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
shooting lvls together or or Chell or if

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.740 
shooting lvls together or or Chell or if
you're<00:02:28.170> just<00:02:28.200> shooting<00:02:28.470> stud<00:02:29.220> so<00:02:29.520> yeah<00:02:30.060> now<00:02:30.450> as

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
you're just shooting stud so yeah now as

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.750 
you're just shooting stud so yeah now as
I<00:02:30.930> look<00:02:30.960> at<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:31.320> what<00:02:31.800> about<00:02:31.980> this<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.520> that<00:02:32.700> a

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
I look at it what about this is that a

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.430 
I look at it what about this is that a
good<00:02:33.030> design<00:02:33.330> or<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.540> bad<00:02:33.720> design<00:02:34.020> I<00:02:34.170> mean<00:02:34.290> just

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
good design or a bad design I mean just

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.380 
good design or a bad design I mean just
as<00:02:34.560> far<00:02:34.770> as<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.010> size<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.430> map<00:02:35.550> I<00:02:35.700> think<00:02:36.000> it

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
as far as the size of the map I think it

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.780 
as far as the size of the map I think it
could<00:02:36.540> use<00:02:36.570> a<00:02:36.750> bigger<00:02:37.050> magazine<00:02:37.650> if<00:02:37.860> it<00:02:38.520> seems

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
could use a bigger magazine if it seems

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:39.950 
could use a bigger magazine if it seems
like<00:02:38.970> you're<00:02:39.090> loading<00:02:39.390> all<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.570> time<00:02:39.780> when

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
like you're loading all the time when

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.510 
like you're loading all the time when
you're<00:02:40.110> using<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.500> but<00:02:40.650> like<00:02:40.830> I<00:02:40.950> said<00:02:41.010> it's<00:02:41.370> for

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
you're using it but like I said it's for

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.920 
you're using it but like I said it's for
smaller<00:02:41.820> projects<00:02:42.390> anyway<00:02:42.690> you're<00:02:42.900> not

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
smaller projects anyway you're not

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.570 
smaller projects anyway you're not
nailing<00:02:43.290> on<00:02:43.470> sheeting<00:02:43.860> or<00:02:43.980> anything<00:02:44.160> with<00:02:44.400> it

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
nailing on sheeting or anything with it

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.610 
nailing on sheeting or anything with it
so<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:45.540> know<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:45.780> go<00:02:45.960> through<00:02:45.990> all<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:46.440> many

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
so you know you go through all that many

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.560 
so you know you go through all that many
nails<00:02:46.860> with<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.190> but<00:02:47.370> if<00:02:47.940> it<00:02:48.030> had<00:02:48.150> more<00:02:48.360> nails

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
nails with it but if it had more nails

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.690 
nails with it but if it had more nails
it<00:02:48.780> would<00:02:48.870> be<00:02:48.990> nice<00:02:49.170> okay<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:50.160> let's<00:02:50.550> talk

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
it would be nice okay so let's talk

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.140 
it would be nice okay so let's talk
about<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:51.240> quality<00:02:51.840> because<00:02:52.110> this<00:02:52.800> is

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
about the quality because this is

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.910 
about the quality because this is
plastic<00:02:54.150> right<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:54.780> is<00:02:54.900> plastic<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.650> you'd

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
plastic right it is plastic and you'd

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.890 
plastic right it is plastic and you'd
think<00:02:56.190> that<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.580> would<00:02:56.730> break<00:02:56.940> awful<00:02:57.360> easy<00:02:57.480> but

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
think that it would break awful easy but

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.560 
think that it would break awful easy but
it<00:02:58.170> seems<00:02:58.740> to<00:02:58.950> hold<00:02:59.100> up<00:02:59.340> I<00:02:59.670> have<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.060> original

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
it seems to hold up I have the original

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.240 
it seems to hold up I have the original
one<00:03:00.930> of<00:03:01.170> these<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.500> I've<00:03:01.590> had<00:03:01.770> it<00:03:01.800> for<00:03:01.920> years

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
one of these and I've had it for years

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.890 
one of these and I've had it for years
and<00:03:02.340> it's<00:03:02.550> been<00:03:02.670> dropped<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:03.030> lot<00:03:03.180> of<00:03:03.300> times<00:03:03.540> and

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
and it's been dropped a lot of times and

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.750 
and it's been dropped a lot of times and
ain't<00:03:04.410> cracked<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.770> yet<00:03:04.800> so<00:03:05.400> you<00:03:05.460> got<00:03:05.670> the

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
ain't cracked it yet so you got the

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.670 
ain't cracked it yet so you got the
night<00:03:05.910> cat<00:03:06.120> version<00:03:06.330> yes<00:03:06.870> I<00:03:06.990> do<00:03:07.170> okay<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.560> little

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
bit heavier there right a little bit

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.970 
bit heavier there right a little bit
heavier<00:03:09.210> yeah<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:10.380> batteries<00:03:10.740> are<00:03:10.770> much

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
heavier yeah and the batteries are much

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.900 
heavier yeah and the batteries are much
bigger<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:12.150> old<00:03:12.330> ones<00:03:12.630> okay<00:03:13.290> what<00:03:13.800> about

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
bigger the old ones okay what about

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.940 
bigger the old ones okay what about
recharge<00:03:14.910> time<00:03:15.210> on<00:03:15.360> that<00:03:15.480> um<00:03:15.720> I'm<00:03:16.470> not

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
recharge time on that um I'm not

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.980 
recharge time on that um I'm not
I<00:03:16.980> think<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.370> recharge<00:03:17.760> is<00:03:17.910> about<00:03:18.090> 15<00:03:18.600> minutes

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
I think the recharge is about 15 minutes

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.920 
I think the recharge is about 15 minutes
or<00:03:19.140> so<00:03:19.320> and<00:03:19.820> you<00:03:20.820> know<00:03:20.880> that's<00:03:21.180> 15<00:03:21.540> minutes<00:03:21.690> of

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
or so and you know that's 15 minutes of

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.110 
or so and you know that's 15 minutes of
downtime<00:03:22.290> for<00:03:22.500> us<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:22.950> it<00:03:23.520> would<00:03:23.640> be<00:03:23.940> really

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
downtime for us so it would be really

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.280 
downtime for us so it would be really
nice<00:03:24.330> if<00:03:24.390> it<00:03:24.570> came<00:03:24.690> with<00:03:24.750> two<00:03:24.930> of<00:03:25.170> them

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
nice if it came with two of them

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.220 
nice if it came with two of them
batteries<00:03:26.190> so<00:03:26.610> alrighty<00:03:27.180> well<00:03:27.690> let's<00:03:28.050> talk

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
batteries so alrighty well let's talk

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.140 
batteries so alrighty well let's talk
about<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.680> value<00:03:29.070> then<00:03:29.340> what<00:03:29.820> do<00:03:29.880> you<00:03:29.970> think

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
about the value then what do you think

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.680 
about the value then what do you think
about<00:03:30.270> it

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
about it

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.870 
about it
um<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:31.110> think<00:03:31.200> that<00:03:31.440> it's<00:03:31.890> a<00:03:32.010> pretty<00:03:32.250> good<00:03:32.430> value

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
um I think that it's a pretty good value

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.330 
um I think that it's a pretty good value
to<00:03:33.180> have<00:03:33.360> one<00:03:33.690> on<00:03:33.900> each<00:03:34.050> job<00:03:34.080> site<00:03:34.680> maybe<00:03:34.950> for

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
to have one on each job site maybe for

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.920 
to have one on each job site maybe for
doing<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:36.120> stuff<00:03:36.360> that<00:03:36.540> you<00:03:36.630> would<00:03:36.780> use

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
doing the the stuff that you would use

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.500 
doing the the stuff that you would use
it<00:03:37.110> for<00:03:37.320> I<00:03:37.590> know<00:03:37.740> a<00:03:38.130> company<00:03:38.640> that<00:03:38.880> had<00:03:39.210> nothing

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
it for I know a company that had nothing

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.360 
it for I know a company that had nothing

buy the fuel and the extra batteries and
everything<00:03:43.530> for<00:03:44.040> them<00:03:44.130> it's<00:03:44.220> just<00:03:44.280> not<00:03:44.550> worth

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
everything for them it's just not worth

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.120 
everything for them it's just not worth
