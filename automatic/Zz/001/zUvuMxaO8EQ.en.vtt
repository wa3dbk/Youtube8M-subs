the time but I know now it made the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.350 
the time but I know now it made the
transition<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.820> little<00:01:24.150> bit<00:01:24.270> easier<00:01:24.689> I

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
transition just a little bit easier I

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.240 
transition just a little bit easier I

was really trying to draw with my
paintbrush<00:01:29.840> and<00:01:31.280> that's<00:01:32.280> what<00:01:32.490> really<00:01:32.729> really

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
paintbrush and that's what really really

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.880 
paintbrush and that's what really really
that's<00:01:33.600> what<00:01:33.720> painting<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.170> you're<00:01:34.560> drawing

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
that's what painting is you're drawing

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:45.550 
that's what painting is you're drawing
with<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.159> paintbrush<00:01:35.400> instead<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.240> pencil
