00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.220 

right<00:00:05.500> plug<00:00:05.890> lies<00:00:06.160> in<00:00:06.490> a<00:00:06.610> bunker<00:00:07.000> and<00:00:07.840> really

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:08.230 
right plug lies in a bunker and really

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.470 
right plug lies in a bunker and really
there's<00:00:08.440> basically<00:00:08.980> two<00:00:09.400> ways<00:00:09.430> to<00:00:10.090> play<00:00:10.299> this

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.480 
there's basically two ways to play this

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.980 
there's basically two ways to play this
shot

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:10.990 
shot

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.790 
shot
most<00:00:11.620> people<00:00:12.130> close<00:00:12.970> the<00:00:13.180> face<00:00:13.420> hit<00:00:14.139> down<00:00:14.410> hard

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:14.800 
most people close the face hit down hard

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.280 
most people close the face hit down hard
take<00:00:15.490> an<00:00:15.670> awful<00:00:16.059> lot<00:00:16.150> of<00:00:16.180> sand<00:00:16.540> the<00:00:16.990> sands

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:17.290 
take an awful lot of sand the sands

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.960 
take an awful lot of sand the sands
moving<00:00:17.770> forward<00:00:18.250> it<00:00:18.340> carries<00:00:18.670> the<00:00:18.820> ball

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
moving forward it carries the ball

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.570 
moving forward it carries the ball
forward<00:00:19.480> and<00:00:19.599> it<00:00:20.110> has<00:00:20.259> a<00:00:20.290> lot<00:00:20.650> of<00:00:20.680> release<00:00:21.250> on

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
forward and it has a lot of release on

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.120 
forward and it has a lot of release on
it<00:00:21.820> when<00:00:22.300> it<00:00:22.449> hits<00:00:22.779> the<00:00:23.470> ground<00:00:23.500> this<00:00:23.890> is<00:00:23.949> the

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
it when it hits the ground this is the

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.179 
it when it hits the ground this is the
safest<00:00:24.670> way<00:00:24.970> to<00:00:25.300> play<00:00:25.690> plug<00:00:25.960> lies<00:00:26.199> so<00:00:26.770> really

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
safest way to play plug lies so really

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.849 
safest way to play plug lies so really
most<00:00:27.340> people<00:00:27.609> close<00:00:28.570> the<00:00:28.810> club<00:00:28.990> face<00:00:29.050> get<00:00:29.710> the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:29.859 
most people close the club face get the

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.880 
most people close the club face get the
leading<00:00:30.250> edge<00:00:30.430> deaiing<00:00:31.029> so<00:00:31.570> this<00:00:31.720> time<00:00:32.019> a<00:00:32.290> dig

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
leading edge deaiing so this time a dig

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.950 
leading edge deaiing so this time a dig
will<00:00:33.160> actually<00:00:33.519> work<00:00:33.699> but<00:00:34.150> you<00:00:34.269> lose<00:00:34.540> total

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
will actually work but you lose total

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.930 
will actually work but you lose total
control<00:00:35.170> and<00:00:35.920> I'm<00:00:36.430> going<00:00:36.640> to<00:00:36.670> demonstrate

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
control and I'm going to demonstrate

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.780 
control and I'm going to demonstrate
that<00:00:37.510> really<00:00:37.839> quite<00:00:38.129> Markley<00:00:39.129> that<00:00:39.339> the<00:00:39.550> ball

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
that really quite Markley that the ball

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.399 
that really quite Markley that the ball
will<00:00:40.000> actually<00:00:40.360> release<00:00:40.540> and<00:00:40.989> it's<00:00:41.080> really<00:00:41.320> a

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:41.409 
will actually release and it's really a

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:44.189 
will actually release and it's really a
closed<00:00:41.739> clubface<00:00:42.070> and<00:00:42.670> steep<00:00:43.540> the<00:00:43.720> steep<00:00:43.989> as

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
closed clubface and steep the steep as

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:46.680 
closed clubface and steep the steep as
you<00:00:44.320> can<00:00:44.559> take<00:00:45.100> as<00:00:45.309> much<00:00:45.519> sand<00:00:45.850> as<00:00:46.000> you<00:00:46.120> cap<00:00:46.420> and

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
you can take as much sand as you cap and

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.469 
you can take as much sand as you cap and
hit<00:00:46.989> it<00:00:47.199> but<00:00:47.440> that<00:00:47.589> ball<00:00:47.890> just<00:00:48.549> releases<00:00:49.239> very

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:49.479 
hit it but that ball just releases very

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:51.630 
hit it but that ball just releases very
quickly<00:00:49.839> the<00:00:50.440> reason<00:00:50.830> it<00:00:50.920> releases<00:00:51.489> is

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
quickly the reason it releases is

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.000 
quickly the reason it releases is
because<00:00:52.059> you're<00:00:52.330> pressing<00:00:53.229> this<00:00:53.409> sand

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
because you're pressing this sand

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.160 
because you're pressing this sand
forward<00:00:54.699> the<00:00:55.089> ball's<00:00:55.330> carried<00:00:55.869> on<00:00:56.019> the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
forward the ball's carried on the

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.289 
forward the ball's carried on the
forward<00:00:56.440> momentum<00:00:56.680> of<00:00:57.190> the<00:00:57.309> sand<00:00:57.580> and<00:00:57.850> it

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:58.299 
forward momentum of the sand and it

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:00.570 
forward momentum of the sand and it
releases<00:00:58.659> so<00:00:59.500> if<00:00:59.799> you've<00:00:59.920> got<00:01:00.070> a<00:01:00.100> lot<00:01:00.309> of<00:01:00.339> room

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
releases so if you've got a lot of room

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.439 
releases so if you've got a lot of room
to<00:01:00.610> work<00:01:00.909> with

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
to work with

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.509 
to work with
very<00:01:01.839> easy<00:01:02.019> shot<00:01:02.350> to<00:01:02.530> play<00:01:02.769> and<00:01:03.040> very

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
very easy shot to play and very

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.490 
very easy shot to play and very
effective<00:01:04.180> if<00:01:04.330> you've<00:01:04.809> not<00:01:05.049> got<00:01:05.229> a<00:01:05.260> lot<00:01:05.470> of

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
effective if you've not got a lot of

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.770 
effective if you've not got a lot of
room<00:01:05.740> to<00:01:05.770> play<00:01:06.159> and<00:01:06.400> you<00:01:06.850> have<00:01:07.119> to<00:01:07.390> get<00:01:07.570> the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
room to play and you have to get the

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.170 
room to play and you have to get the
ball<00:01:07.930> close<00:01:08.039> there<00:01:09.039> is<00:01:09.070> another<00:01:09.460> way<00:01:09.729> but<00:01:09.789> it's

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
ball close there is another way but it's

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:17.849 
ball close there is another way but it's
actually<00:01:10.600> a<00:01:10.630> very<00:01:10.719> specialist<00:01:11.500> way<00:01:16.710> right<00:01:17.710> I'm

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:17.859 
actually a very specialist way right I'm

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:18.870 
actually a very specialist way right I'm
going<00:01:17.979> to<00:01:18.009> show<00:01:18.100> you<00:01:18.189> another<00:01:18.430> way<00:01:18.609> to<00:01:18.640> play

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
going to show you another way to play

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.959 
going to show you another way to play
plug<00:01:19.210> light<00:01:19.420> if<00:01:19.689> you<00:01:20.409> have<00:01:20.679> to<00:01:20.920> land<00:01:21.100> it<00:01:21.310> softly

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:21.969 
plug light if you have to land it softly

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:24.899 
plug light if you have to land it softly
and<00:01:22.329> get<00:01:22.479> it<00:01:22.600> to<00:01:22.689> land<00:01:22.869> softly<00:01:23.380> and<00:01:23.909> obviously

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
and get it to land softly and obviously

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.480 
and get it to land softly and obviously
get<00:01:25.630> a<00:01:25.689> lot<00:01:25.899> more<00:01:25.929> control<00:01:26.380> but<00:01:26.799> it<00:01:26.890> is<00:01:27.039> a<00:01:27.280> high

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
get a lot more control but it is a high

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.700 
get a lot more control but it is a high
Terry<00:01:27.820> shot<00:01:28.179> so<00:01:28.539> if<00:01:28.869> you<00:01:29.079> haven't<00:01:29.200> practiced

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
Terry shot so if you haven't practiced

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.529 
Terry shot so if you haven't practiced
it<00:01:29.920> a<00:01:29.950> lot<00:01:30.189> I<00:01:30.369> probably<00:01:30.700> wouldn't<00:01:31.000> try<00:01:31.270> it<00:01:31.299> I'd

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
it a lot I probably wouldn't try it I'd

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:33.480 
it a lot I probably wouldn't try it I'd
probably<00:01:31.570> use<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.170> first<00:01:32.380> one<00:01:32.530> and<00:01:32.799> go<00:01:33.249> for<00:01:33.460> a

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
probably use the first one and go for a

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.279 
probably use the first one and go for a
20-foot<00:01:33.969> putt<00:01:34.210> back<00:01:34.450> to<00:01:34.689> try<00:01:34.869> and<00:01:34.990> hold<00:01:35.079> your

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
20-foot putt back to try and hold your

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.590 
20-foot putt back to try and hold your
path<00:01:35.499> but<00:01:36.130> if<00:01:36.219> you<00:01:36.340> have<00:01:36.579> to<00:01:36.850> and<00:01:37.060> you'll<00:01:37.149> see<00:01:37.359> a

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
path but if you have to and you'll see a

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.480 
path but if you have to and you'll see a
lot<00:01:38.020> of<00:01:38.079> the<00:01:38.229> really<00:01:38.439> really<00:01:38.950> good<00:01:39.130> bunker

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
lot of the really really good bunker

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.609 
lot of the really really good bunker
players<00:01:39.759> play<00:01:40.119> this<00:01:40.299> shot<00:01:40.539> occasionally<00:01:41.140> now

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
players play this shot occasionally now

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.859 
players play this shot occasionally now
when<00:01:41.859> it's<00:01:42.039> plugged<00:01:42.429> what<00:01:43.179> you<00:01:43.299> really<00:01:43.689> need

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
when it's plugged what you really need

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.080 
when it's plugged what you really need
to<00:01:43.960> do<00:01:44.079> is<00:01:44.170> cut<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.499> sand<00:01:44.740> and<00:01:45.369> most<00:01:45.670> people

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
to do is cut the sand and most people

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.270 
to do is cut the sand and most people
obviously<00:01:46.210> close<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:46.929> club<00:01:47.109> face<00:01:47.170> it<00:01:47.979> takes

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
obviously close the club face it takes

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.300 
obviously close the club face it takes
the<00:01:48.429> bounce<00:01:48.640> off<00:01:48.939> leading-edge<00:01:49.509> cups.great

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
the bounce off leading-edge cups.great

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.190 
the bounce off leading-edge cups.great
it'll<00:01:51.310> actually<00:01:51.460> get<00:01:51.759> the<00:01:51.909> ball<00:01:52.060> out<00:01:52.090> now<00:01:52.990> then

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
it'll actually get the ball out now then

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.730 
it'll actually get the ball out now then
the<00:01:53.649> sharpest<00:01:54.219> part<00:01:54.549> of<00:01:54.759> your<00:01:55.299> club<00:01:55.659> is<00:01:55.840> in

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
the sharpest part of your club is in

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.919 
the sharpest part of your club is in
your<00:01:57.039> heel<00:01:57.369> the<00:01:57.850> heel<00:01:57.880> of<00:01:58.299> the<00:01:58.390> club<00:01:58.420> they're

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929

your heel the heel of the club they're
right<00:01:59.259> at<00:01:59.439> the<00:01:59.530> heel<00:01:59.710> that's<00:02:00.039> a<00:02:00.159> real<00:02:00.369> sharp

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
right at the heel that's a real sharp

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.539 
right at the heel that's a real sharp
part<00:02:01.090> and<00:02:01.600> what<00:02:01.810> good<00:02:02.049> players<00:02:02.439> will<00:02:02.770> do<00:02:03.009> if

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
part and what good players will do if

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.609 
part and what good players will do if
they<00:02:03.789> need<00:02:04.030> to<00:02:04.179> land<00:02:04.359> it<00:02:04.600> soft<00:02:04.899> out<00:02:05.139> of<00:02:05.289> a<00:02:05.380> plug

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
they need to land it soft out of a plug

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.160 
they need to land it soft out of a plug
lie<00:02:05.859> they<00:02:06.399> will<00:02:06.609> start<00:02:06.939> using<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.509> heel<00:02:07.840> today

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
lie they will start using the heel today

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.590 
lie they will start using the heel today
so<00:02:08.920> this<00:02:09.069> time<00:02:09.369> I'm<00:02:09.550> going<00:02:09.670> to<00:02:09.759> lower<00:02:09.970> my<00:02:10.060> hands

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
so this time I'm going to lower my hands

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.039 
so this time I'm going to lower my hands
so<00:02:11.020> the<00:02:11.170> heel<00:02:11.470> is<00:02:11.980> actually<00:02:12.459> going<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:13.049> reach

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
so the heel is actually going to reach

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:15.720 
so the heel is actually going to reach
the<00:02:14.290> sand<00:02:14.530> first<00:02:14.890> it's<00:02:15.099> going<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.340> cut<00:02:15.580> the

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
the sand first it's going to cut the

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.850 
the sand first it's going to cut the
sand<00:02:16.000> and<00:02:16.269> what<00:02:16.659> I'm<00:02:16.780> going<00:02:16.959> to<00:02:17.080> do

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
sand and what I'm going to do

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.520 
sand and what I'm going to do
there<00:02:18.010> is<00:02:18.550> I'm<00:02:18.790> going<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.090> try<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:19.450> hold<00:02:19.720> the

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
there is I'm going to try and hold the

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.240 
there is I'm going to try and hold the
sand<00:02:20.860> on<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:22.300> face<00:02:22.540> as<00:02:23.050> long<00:02:23.140> as<00:02:23.470> possible<00:02:23.710> so

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
sand on the face as long as possible so

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.730 
sand on the face as long as possible so
that<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.060> actual<00:02:25.390> cushion<00:02:26.230> of<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:26.470> sand

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
that the actual cushion of the sand

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.220 
that the actual cushion of the sand
under<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.370> ball<00:02:27.550> elevates<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:28.510> ball<00:02:28.690> so<00:02:29.200> that

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
under the ball elevates the ball so that

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.780 
under the ball elevates the ball so that
will<00:02:29.530> look<00:02:29.710> something<00:02:30.130> like<00:02:30.160> this

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
will look something like this

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.290 
will look something like this
my<00:02:30.970> butterfly<00:02:31.510> grip<00:02:32.200> here<00:02:32.920> and<00:02:33.910> I'm<00:02:34.030> going<00:02:34.210> to

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
my butterfly grip here and I'm going to

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.320 
my butterfly grip here and I'm going to
call<00:02:34.750> he'll<00:02:35.230> cut<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:35.830> hold<00:02:36.190> it<00:02:36.430> so<00:02:37.030> I<00:02:37.060> go

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
call he'll cut and hold it so I go

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.400 
call he'll cut and hold it so I go
really<00:02:37.690> steep<00:02:38.140> dig<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:40.510> it<00:02:40.600> comes<00:02:40.870> out<00:02:41.140> really

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
really steep dig and it comes out really

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.770 
really steep dig and it comes out really
quite<00:02:42.190> soft<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.120> won't<00:02:43.300> run<00:02:43.510> away<00:02:43.600> from

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
quite soft and it won't run away from

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.830 
quite soft and it won't run away from
you<00:02:44.140> there<00:02:44.980> is<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:45.100> third<00:02:45.340> option<00:02:45.580> but<00:02:46.240> don't

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
down you're reducing the bounce when you

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.550 
down you're reducing the bounce when you
tow<00:03:41.860> it<00:03:42.040> down<00:03:42.070> okay<00:03:43.000> so<00:03:43.299> you<00:03:43.390> can<00:03:43.660> dig<00:03:43.900> and

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
tow it down okay so you can dig and

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.650 
tow it down okay so you can dig and
that's<00:03:44.739> that's<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.250> safest<00:03:45.670> shot<00:03:45.880> and<00:03:46.180> if<00:03:46.510> you

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
that's that's the safest shot and if you

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.750 
that's that's the safest shot and if you
stop<00:03:46.989> you're<00:03:47.290> your<00:03:47.890> follow-through<00:03:48.310> you

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
stop you're your follow-through you

abbreviated follow throughs absolutely

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.850 
abbreviated follow throughs absolutely
because<00:04:01.540> that's<00:04:01.750> something<00:04:01.930> to<00:04:02.049> hold<00:04:02.200> at<00:04:02.500> cut

right<00:04:22.330> here<00:04:22.600> it's

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
right here it's

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.350 
right here it's
reducing<00:04:24.530> the<00:04:24.800> the<00:04:25.039> heels<00:04:25.310> which<00:04:25.699> allows<00:04:26.090> the

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
reducing the the heels which allows the

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.390 
reducing the the heels which allows the
leading<00:04:26.659> edge<00:04:26.840> to<00:04:27.500> dig<00:04:27.740> and<00:04:27.949> get<00:04:28.099> underneath

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
leading edge to dig and get underneath

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.420 
leading edge to dig and get underneath
that<00:04:28.699> golf<00:04:28.970> ball<00:04:29.180> so<00:04:29.870> that<00:04:30.139> enables<00:04:31.009> that<00:04:31.069> shot

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
that golf ball so that enables that shot

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.700 
that golf ball so that enables that shot
