and now finally onto its hair so the
closest<00:03:00.780> I<00:03:00.900> could<00:03:00.989> find<00:03:01.409> to<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:02.159> hair<00:03:02.400> in<00:03:02.519> the

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
closest I could find to the hair in the

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.759 
closest I could find to the hair in the
movie<00:03:02.940> was<00:03:03.390> actually<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.900> side<00:03:04.170> passing

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
movie was actually the side passing

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.130 
movie was actually the side passing
light<00:03:05.040> spikes<00:03:05.459> Brown<00:03:05.879> cut<00:03:06.359> now<00:03:06.900> this<00:03:07.079> is

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
light spikes Brown cut now this is

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.660 
light spikes Brown cut now this is
actually<00:03:07.349> quite<00:03:07.440> similar<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.010> Toby's<00:03:08.459> in<00:03:08.609> the

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
actually quite similar to Toby's in the

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.280 
actually quite similar to Toby's in the
movie<00:03:08.970> although<00:03:09.150> it's<00:03:09.420> not<00:03:09.690> quite<00:03:10.049> perfect

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
movie although it's not quite perfect

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.289 
movie although it's not quite perfect
now<00:03:11.099> this<00:03:11.250> is<00:03:11.340> about<00:03:11.489> as<00:03:11.670> close<00:03:11.849> as<00:03:11.909> you<00:03:12.150> can
