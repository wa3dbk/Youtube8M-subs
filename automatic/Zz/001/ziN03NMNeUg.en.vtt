first thing we do is make sure draw is
formatted<00:00:09.599> correctly<00:00:09.840> so<00:00:10.380> we<00:00:10.410> click

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
formatted correctly so we click

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.530 
formatted correctly so we click
spotlight<00:00:11.250> just<00:00:11.519> start<00:00:11.940> typing<00:00:12.210> in<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.509> word

there<00:00:14.280> we<00:00:14.490> go<00:00:14.610> Disk<00:00:15.000> Utility<00:00:16.580> today<00:00:17.580> we're

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
there we go Disk Utility today we're

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.599 
there we go Disk Utility today we're
going<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:17.970> set<00:00:18.150> up<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.270> 16<00:00:18.990> gig<00:00:19.230> USB<00:00:19.500> thumb<00:00:20.310> drive

going to set up a 16 gig USB thumb drive

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.130 
going to set up a 16 gig USB thumb drive
but<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.090> could<00:00:21.210> be<00:00:21.330> anything<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.930> most

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
but it could be anything the most

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.019 
but it could be anything the most
important<00:00:22.560> thing<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.980> make<00:00:23.760> sure<00:00:23.789> it's

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
important thing is make sure it's

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.650 
important thing is make sure it's
formatted<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:25.170> use<00:00:25.490> Apple's<00:00:26.490> format<00:00:27.150> hard

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
formatted to use Apple's format hard

drive that is Mac OS extended journaled

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:43.280 
drive that is Mac OS extended journaled
so<00:00:32.820> we'll<00:00:33.030> do<00:00:33.270> FCP<00:00:34.370> x<00:00:39.860> hard<00:00:40.860> drive<00:00:41.750> and<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:43.260> can

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
so we'll do FCP x hard drive and you can

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.090 
so we'll do FCP x hard drive and you can
just<00:00:43.500> click<00:00:43.680> erase<00:00:43.980> there<00:00:45.890> obviously<00:00:46.890> make

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
just click erase there obviously make

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.670 
just click erase there obviously make
sure<00:00:47.129> there's<00:00:47.430> nothing<00:00:47.520> on<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.170> and<00:00:49.170> then<00:00:49.410> once

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
sure there's nothing on it and then once

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.910 
sure there's nothing on it and then once
that's<00:00:49.860> finished<00:00:51.170> it<00:00:52.170> can<00:00:52.350> take<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> second

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
that's finished it can take a second

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.180 
that's finished it can take a second

SD card this is just a little test mode
we<00:02:27.050> put<00:02:27.350> the<00:02:27.950> most<00:02:28.130> important<00:02:28.640> thing<00:02:28.760> is<00:02:29.000> to

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
we put the most important thing is to

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.320 
we put the most important thing is to
look<00:02:29.959> to<00:02:30.200> where<00:02:30.410> you're<00:02:31.280> putting<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:32.000> event

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
look to where you're putting the event

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.120 
look to where you're putting the event
and<00:02:32.570> obviously<00:02:33.050> we're<00:02:33.260> adding<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:33.709> to<00:02:33.830> test

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
and obviously we're adding it to test

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.090 
and obviously we're adding it to test
our<00:02:34.310> external<00:02:34.519> events<00:02:35.150> spell<00:02:35.870> home<00:02:36.140> or<00:02:36.890> you

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
can create a new event directly and then

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.009 
can create a new event directly and then
select<00:02:39.799> where<00:02:40.040> you<00:02:40.100> want<00:02:40.489> it<00:02:40.730> if<00:02:41.420> your

probably<00:02:44.239> because<00:02:44.540> it's<00:02:44.690> not<00:02:44.810> formatted

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
probably because it's not formatted

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.789 
probably because it's not formatted
correctly<00:02:47.140> so<00:02:48.140> we're<00:02:48.260> going<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.500> add<00:02:48.590> the

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
correctly so we're going to add the

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.100 
correctly so we're going to add the
external<00:02:49.130> event<00:02:49.580> and<00:02:50.570> then<00:02:50.690> you<00:02:50.780> want<00:02:50.930> to<00:02:50.989> make

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
external event and then you want to make

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.949 
external event and then you want to make
sure<00:02:51.140> it<00:02:51.590> copies<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.100> files<00:02:52.549> to<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:53.360> final

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
sure it copies the files to the final

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.979 
sure it copies the files to the final
cuts<00:02:54.230> events<00:02:54.830> folder<00:02:55.400> so<00:02:56.209> that<00:02:56.360> way<00:02:56.510> your<00:02:56.750> file

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
cuts events folder so that way your file

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.990 
cuts events folder so that way your file
is<00:02:57.290> your<00:02:57.799> footage<00:02:58.190> is<00:02:58.310> actually<00:02:58.430> on<00:02:58.790> the

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
is your footage is actually on the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.130 
is your footage is actually on the
external<00:02:59.330> drives<00:02:59.780> only<00:03:00.230> in<00:03:00.500> a<00:03:00.530> port<00:03:01.989> and<00:03:02.989> again

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
external drives only in a port and again

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.630 
external drives only in a port and again
this<00:03:03.380> might<00:03:03.530> take<00:03:03.799> a<00:03:03.830> second<00:03:04.250> depending<00:03:04.430> on

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
this might take a second depending on

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.509 
this might take a second depending on
how<00:03:04.730> big<00:03:04.910> your<00:03:05.000> project<00:03:05.510> is<00:03:06.220> and<00:03:07.220> now<00:03:07.340> that

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
how big your project is and now that

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.610 
how big your project is and now that
you've<00:03:07.640> got<00:03:07.670> some<00:03:08.060> footage<00:03:08.330> you<00:03:08.780> click<00:03:09.110> new

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
you've got some footage you click new

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.539 
you've got some footage you click new
project<00:03:11.110> and<00:03:12.110> then<00:03:12.350> it'll<00:03:12.590> ask<00:03:12.830> you<00:03:13.160> what<00:03:13.519> the

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
project and then it'll ask you what the

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.300 
project and then it'll ask you what the
default<00:03:14.060> event<00:03:14.209> is<00:03:14.680> we'll<00:03:15.680> use<00:03:15.890> that<00:03:16.070> same

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
default event is we'll use that same

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.580 
default event is we'll use that same
event

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
event

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:36.020 
event
we'll<00:03:18.590> call<00:03:19.090> project<00:03:27.040> star<00:03:28.040> HD

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.330 

and<00:03:37.030> so<00:03:37.210> now<00:03:37.420> we<00:03:37.480> have<00:03:37.690> a<00:03:37.720> project<00:03:37.990> here<00:03:38.340> let's

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
and so now we have a project here let's

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.630 
and so now we have a project here let's
select<00:03:40.060> a<00:03:40.210> little<00:03:40.390> footage<00:03:41.370> dragon<00:03:42.370> in<00:03:42.490> our

timeline and you can just close final

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.190 
timeline and you can just close final
cut<00:03:48.610> you<00:03:48.700> don't<00:03:48.820> have<00:03:49.000> to<00:03:49.090> do<00:03:49.210> saves<00:03:49.570> anymore

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
cut you don't have to do saves anymore

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.950 
cut you don't have to do saves anymore
it's<00:03:50.710> all<00:03:50.860> automatically<00:03:51.520> updated<00:03:52.000> there

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.090

be this will be your original media if

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.650 
be this will be your original media if
you<00:04:29.350> ever<00:04:29.530> need<00:04:29.770> to<00:04:29.890> get<00:04:30.040> to<00:04:30.190> it<00:04:30.310> again<00:04:30.660> and

then the project on this the actual save
file<00:04:37.150> their<00:04:37.390> current<00:04:37.870> version<00:04:38.350> and<00:04:38.530> then<00:04:38.770> as

file their current version and then as

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.560 
file their current version and then as
you<00:04:39.100> work<00:04:39.250> on<00:04:39.490> it<00:04:39.610> and<00:04:39.760> have<00:04:39.880> more<00:04:40.060> versions

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
you work on it and have more versions

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.620 
you work on it and have more versions
but<00:04:40.810> it'll<00:04:41.440> automatically<00:04:41.920> keep<00:04:42.160> track<00:04:42.490> so<00:04:42.820> if

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
but it'll automatically keep track so if

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:44.970 
but it'll automatically keep track so if
you<00:04:43.750> go<00:04:43.900> to<00:04:43.960> another<00:04:44.200> computer<00:04:44.710> that<00:04:44.740> has

you go to another computer that has
Final<00:04:45.400> Cut<00:04:45.580> X<00:04:45.640> and<00:04:46.210> you<00:04:46.270> launch<00:04:46.540> it<00:04:46.780> again
