 developers in the call of duty series 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.229
 it's really times we see this guy 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.819
 of this type of micro dlc with precisely 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.500
 the voices of certain actors or 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:39.840

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.500
 sent to tweet how to tell 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.750

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.179

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.660
 turin movies has subsequently responded 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.690
 actually we need your 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.780
 votes to know what will be the content of the 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.220
 next micro dlc so in what we 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.319
 will say in this small survey we have the 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.670
 chance to vote for ten votes of ten 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.520
 characters among others the most famous 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.900
 erik hartmann from the chuck pork series 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.360
 morgan freeman who plays in batman 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.620
 among others and of course arnold 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.750
 scharzenegger who plays in 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.909
 in in terminator I think about that 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.700
 it was the best known of the d3 the lily 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:28.500
 and on which I have the most hesitation me 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.909
 personally I voted for morgan 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.590
 freeman I think it's really worth it 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.360
 I would love to see him 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.769
 in a dlc and that I find it really 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.470
 interesting that a movie is giving us 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.450
 the chance to vote for for 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.920
 next dlc but it's from 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.750
 the computer does not know from the 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.909
 playstation network of the playstation 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.629
 network or an xbox live we vote 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.370
 as we did last year 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.420
 actually black ops you have us 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.030
 does this type of vote 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.019
 with a camouflage I had the 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.069
 plus it was some flash words you in 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.930
 have the chance to vote for four 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.489
 camouflage and then in these four there 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.170
 two will be selected well there is the 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.400
 same thing today I would put link 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.420
 many teeth in the description have I 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.349
 asked the community channels code 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.970
 qg that 2 cf 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.129
 if they would like to claude me to put 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.440
 the survey link in the description 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.480
 for you all to go to vote and 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.390
 have the chance to select the 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.700
 content of the next dlc the next 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.290
 micro dlc that's who had done that to us 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.239
 the days of black ops the us had 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.280
 allowed to vote on the playstation 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.019
 network and xbox live 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.700
 and then it's the same thing has the 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.019
 right to a vote between these ten 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.730
 characters personally as I have 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.169
 said i took morgan freeman so that's it 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.030
 I find it very interesting from 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:32.010
 of infinity ward to leave us the 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.090
 chance to vote I hope it's going to be 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.530
 reproduce more often when they have 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.090
 had to get out of the mics dlc like that's okay 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.069
 to be a little bit of us to choose 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.329
 the future of microphones dlc so here are the 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.260
 I hope you enjoyed the video 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.549
