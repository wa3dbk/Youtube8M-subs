 it's true that the control region has few common points 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.779
 with the Asian steppes and yet recently we can see this site 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:15.349

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.230
 cows 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.159
 comforted by their police name 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:33.519
 we are waiting in the construction of their ecological house the city had to 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:37.220
 find a little over three years ago a temporary solution to house his 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:38.000
 family 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.620
 on this land lent by friends he decided to install that bear 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.020
 manufactured in France administratively no major concern the post provides this 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.310
 case 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.020
 they created a number for us 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.160
 so if his coast is at 19 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.480
 they made 19 goals for us 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.180
 and the texan general these mobile habitats what so for caravans it's 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.690
 one so 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.299
 unveiling in the mail arrived there and we are 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:05.630
 but it's easier 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.440
 hovering doubt we continue in the walls best technicians 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.009
 perfectly military 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.770
 and ensures a certain coolness in the summer inside a whole space 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.020
 common 35 square meters with three desks ebony kitchen 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.520
 after this date 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.170
 we have to liquidate a lot of things 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.710
 so that it is not too invasive 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.180
 we reduced yesterday 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.430
 indeed some announce that I do not hear the slightest 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.000
 sanitary side better not be easy the dry toilet and 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.070
 of instability then very rewarding 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.840
 next to it is also the caravan which houses the bedrooms 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.090
 rather sober if he considers as summer 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.090
 the little family they have a lot outside 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.720
 the greenback is very favorable 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.420
 thanks to the year 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.820
 suddenly we support more climate found everywhere 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.870
 people are still talking in april in paris for the fourth round everywhere 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.870
 but finally when we are in the time where the supporter 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.979
 so we will have more 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:14.019
 name change 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.019
 yet they do not sell more than 120 guests 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.669
 entirely 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:23.630
 with us living in a safe place is a pioneering business 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.450
 the choice of celebrities life that figures were for the least 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.500
 original and for good reason it is not marginal either 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:31.840
 nor is it 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.170
 a great walk replacing the system and ice is that it is 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.119
 true that it brings 

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:39.639
 a particular rhythm that's for sure 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.739
 but it's true 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.940
 after three years here david and his family have become acclimated 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:48.499
 and even go so far as to question their initial construction project 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.140
 the provisional yurt could well settle in the duration 

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:57.289
 in front of the vacations what 

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:59.169
 why the world 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:02.639
 work to pay a house to his name on the comfort that must be done 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.929
 these last years
