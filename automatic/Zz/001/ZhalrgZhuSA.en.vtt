00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
that comes through the system and kill

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.850 
that comes through the system and kill
it<00:02:07.520> immediately<00:02:07.610> so<00:02:08.569> it<00:02:08.840> really<00:02:09.349> saves<00:02:09.679> your

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
it immediately so it really saves your

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.470 
it immediately so it really saves your
ears<00:02:10.129> in<00:02:10.399> those<00:02:10.519> situations<00:02:11.209> where

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
ears in those situations where

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.440 
ears in those situations where
everybody's<00:02:12.200> like<00:02:12.379> oh<00:02:12.500> no<00:02:13.239> right

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
everybody's like oh no right

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.170 
everybody's like oh no right
so<00:02:14.659> four<00:02:15.019> you've<00:02:15.620> also<00:02:15.739> got<00:02:15.950> four<00:02:16.189> application

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
so four you've also got four application

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.600 
so four you've also got four application
specific<00:02:17.720> voicing<00:02:18.140> modes<00:02:18.319> and<00:02:19.310> what<00:02:19.489> this

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
specific voicing modes and what this

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.580 
specific voicing modes and what this
allows<00:02:19.879> you<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.090> do<00:02:20.299> is<00:02:20.450> set<00:02:20.659> it<00:02:20.720> up<00:02:20.900> for<00:02:21.170> this

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
allows you to do is set it up for this

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.440 
allows you to do is set it up for this
specific<00:02:22.129> application<00:02:22.730> that<00:02:22.879> you're<00:02:23.030> looking

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
so what that'll do is that'll roll off

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.509 
so what that'll do is that'll roll off
some<00:03:01.780> of<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.110> bass<00:03:02.260> so<00:03:02.410> you<00:03:02.500> don't<00:03:02.680> get<00:03:02.860> a<00:03:03.130> real

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
we've got our battery tray and let me

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.660 
we've got our battery tray and let me
just<00:03:14.440> go<00:03:14.530> ahead<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:14.920> open<00:03:15.010> it<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:15.310> actually

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
just go ahead and open it and actually

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:22.199 
just go ahead and open it and actually
show<00:03:15.880> you<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:16.060> batteries<00:03:20.549> so<00:03:21.549> here<00:03:21.849> we<00:03:21.970> have

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
show you the batteries so here we have

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.620 
show you the batteries so here we have
here<00:03:22.599> we<00:03:22.750> have<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:23.019> ability<00:03:23.440> to<00:03:23.560> have<00:03:24.390> D<00:03:25.390> cell

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
here we have the ability to have D cell

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.110 
here we have the ability to have D cell
batteries<00:03:25.660> so<00:03:26.530> I<00:03:26.590> can<00:03:26.769> put<00:03:26.920> in<00:03:27.040> up<00:03:27.310> 8d<00:03:27.910> cell

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
batteries so I can put in up 8d cell

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.789 
batteries so I can put in up 8d cell
batteries<00:03:28.180> to<00:03:28.660> run<00:03:28.810> it<00:03:28.930> on<00:03:28.989> battery<00:03:29.380> power<00:03:29.410> or

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
batteries to run it on battery power or

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.949 
batteries to run it on battery power or
you<00:03:30.220> can<00:03:30.370> use<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.670> lithium<00:03:31.060> ion<00:03:31.510> battery

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
you can use the lithium ion battery

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.479 
you can use the lithium ion battery
option<00:03:32.290> for<00:03:32.470> up<00:03:32.590> to<00:03:32.709> 10<00:03:32.920> hours<00:03:32.950> of<00:03:33.280> battery

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
option for up to 10 hours of battery

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.199 
option for up to 10 hours of battery
life<00:03:33.880> very<00:03:34.840> cool<00:03:35.430> these<00:03:36.430> batteries<00:03:36.940> are<00:03:36.970> an

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
life very cool these batteries are an

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.479 
life very cool these batteries are an
option<00:03:37.690> for<00:03:37.959> it<00:03:38.109> but<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.070> great<00:03:39.250> thing<00:03:39.459> about

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
option for it but the great thing about

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.090 
option for it but the great thing about
this<00:03:39.910> is<00:03:40.209> they<00:03:40.450> last<00:03:40.750> a<00:03:40.989> long<00:03:41.260> long<00:03:41.290> time<00:03:41.799> they

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
this is they last a long long time they

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.430 
this is they last a long long time they
charge<00:03:42.400> up<00:03:42.609> pretty<00:03:42.820> fast<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:43.570> you<00:03:44.140> can<00:03:44.290> use

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
charge up pretty fast and you can use

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.110 
charge up pretty fast and you can use
multiple<00:03:44.950> batteries<00:03:45.160> in<00:03:45.549> case<00:03:45.730> you're<00:03:45.940> in<00:03:46.030> a
