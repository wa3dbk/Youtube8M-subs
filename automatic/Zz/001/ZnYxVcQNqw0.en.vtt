00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.629
 Sao Paulo was one thing it does not matter 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.420
 much with the legendary team but the next 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.610

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.549

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.810
 corintiana by mass even if it was 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.010
 the author of foreign waste amounts to 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.500
 entrance is free 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.359
 We are in a fifa event so 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.430
 there is a protocol to people though 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.989
 I would like to ask but we are going 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.520
 pass the second warrior player you 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.410
 made the goal in the semifinal scored the goal now 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.420
 in the end what the feeling of doing 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.850
 these two goals to see this whole crowd 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.620
 celebrating happy happy as I said 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.719
 and that the goal was achieved, right? 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.379
 in the others we prepared very well in the 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.079
 Brazil we have a lot of time in preparation 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.320
 in the day to day physical and technical 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:02.190
 everything there is slope erosion and so I 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.840
 I'm really happy because the crowd is the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.680
 We have a very great experience. 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.770
 and we arrived here in Japan with 1 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.960
 We are thinking about what we deserve right or 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:18.400
 Corinthian fan deserves a championship 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:21.340
 so and the people who come here 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.820
 I was going to finish on television 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:28.720
 People who sold the car were not one day 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:32.290
 day charge much jorge alexandre ué 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.200
 and then these things dust when you go in there 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.750
 in the field then remembering these things and 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.550
 It sucked time to change everything from me because 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.430
 I am this person deserves and deserves not 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.170
 Money is a happiness, or wherever. 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.490
 can we give this happiness can that 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.320
 goal you thought you could look 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.960
 also make the goal in the final 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:54.250
 what is enter the field with the governor 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.979
 my team is not dream and I can not 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.140
 speak before achieving my goal is 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.360
 that what is right is not 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.119
 but I dream that it 's coming in the end and it's going 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.890
 make the goal of the final the best in the final 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.960
 but if you talk later 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.209
 this stadium full of Corinthians like this 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.250
 surprised you that it comes in turkey like this 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.600
 surprised many learned given the 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.430
 experience that we have a look 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.140

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.330
 after the first game was also 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.580
 filled the Corinthians and now right where 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.040
 everything was all full of 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.890
 Corinthian cheering for us all 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.260
 stadium screaming corinthians and which 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.519
 it's an incredible motivation right? 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.410
 Do you think it's going to be how you think? 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.810
 What is going to be the party there in Brazil? So? 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.299
 if you already have this bunch of crazy people like 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.489

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.799

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.219
 European is the favorite 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.069
 This messed with you not because I think 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:58.620

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.569
 It gave us strength, we did not know 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.209
 that we have a lot of quality in the team 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.220
 and we knew it was going to be strong but we 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.560
 have to run score and have a lot of 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.260
 humidity and and easy you can win 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.079

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.359
 a lot of quality but we also then we 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.709
 we trust and we can be 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.780
