kind of like someone that just throws

that he's actually talking about doing

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.790 
that he's actually talking about doing
he<00:00:13.500> wants<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:14.130> hit<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:15.089> ramp<00:00:15.269> okay<00:00:16.049> ran<00:00:16.500> on<00:00:16.770> a

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
he wants to hit a ramp okay ran on a

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.370 
he wants to hit a ramp okay ran on a
rail<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.550> then<00:00:17.699> slide<00:00:18.210> off<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.390> rail<00:00:18.690> off<00:00:19.199> the

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
rail and then slide off a rail off the

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.310 
rail and then slide off a rail off the
bank<00:00:19.590> off<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.400> Grand<00:00:20.609> Canyon<00:00:20.970> yeah<00:00:21.320> every

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
bank off the Grand Canyon yeah every

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.500 
bank off the Grand Canyon yeah every
time<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.529> think<00:00:22.680> about<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.430> get<00:00:23.820> this<00:00:23.970> jittery

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
time I think about it I get this jittery

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.660 
time I think about it I get this jittery
feeling<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:25.590> would<00:00:25.859> say<00:00:26.039> there's<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.369> riskiest

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
feeling I would say there's the riskiest

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.450 
feeling I would say there's the riskiest
thing<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.180> ever<00:00:27.210> done<00:00:28.130> the<00:00:29.130> building

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
thing that I ever done the building

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.790 
thing that I ever done the building
process<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:30.029> this<00:00:30.210> ramp<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:31.349> rail<00:00:31.560> is

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
process of this ramp and this rail is

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.920 
process of this ramp and this rail is
pretty<00:00:32.160> intricate<00:00:32.910> we<00:00:33.270> got<00:00:33.420> these<00:00:33.540> two<00:00:33.750> guys

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
pretty intricate we got these two guys

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.110 
pretty intricate we got these two guys
eating<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.500> they're<00:00:35.160> gonna<00:00:35.250> build<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.850> and

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
eating and they're gonna build it and

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.790 
eating and they're gonna build it and
we're<00:00:36.780> gonna<00:00:36.870> push<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.380> out

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
we're gonna push it out

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.619 
we're gonna push it out
I<00:00:37.829> think<00:00:38.399> this<00:00:38.520> rail<00:00:38.760> slide<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.180> very<00:00:39.390> crucial

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
I think this rail slide is very crucial

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.850 
I think this rail slide is very crucial
because<00:00:39.899> that's<00:00:40.260> going<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.469> give<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.739> the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
because that's going to give you the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.700 
because that's going to give you the
speed<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.760> distance<00:00:41.969> get<00:00:42.510> away<00:00:43.200> from

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
speed and the distance get away from

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.680 
speed and the distance get away from
that<00:00:43.890> big<00:00:44.190> scary<00:00:44.640> clip<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.570> could

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
that big scary clip that could

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.810 
that big scary clip that could
potentially<00:00:46.200> break<00:00:46.379> him<00:00:46.620> if<00:00:47.129> he<00:00:47.309> misses<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
potentially break him if he misses the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.819 
potentially break him if he misses the
rail<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.870> base<00:00:49.079> jump<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.500> can't<00:00:49.710> make

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
rail and a base jump you can't make

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.319 
rail and a base jump you can't make
mistakes<00:00:50.190> like<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.370> I'm<00:00:50.760> not<00:00:51.000> afraid<00:00:51.300> of

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
mistakes like that I'm not afraid of

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:51.830 
mistakes like that I'm not afraid of
dying

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
dying

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.979 
dying
but<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.440> love<00:00:52.739> living<00:00:53.579> I'll<00:00:53.730> use<00:00:53.879> my<00:00:53.910> fear<00:00:54.420> to

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
but I love living I'll use my fear to

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:55.850 
but I love living I'll use my fear to
keep<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.590> check

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
keep that in check

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:20.249 
keep that in check
It's<00:00:56.670> Showtime

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.070

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
looked to me like when he dropped he was

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.570 
looked to me like when he dropped he was
literally<00:01:25.689> above<00:01:26.350> the<00:01:26.920> far<00:01:27.189> wall

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
literally above the far wall

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.750 
literally above the far wall
200<00:01:29.580> feet<00:01:29.820> away<00:01:29.940> jump

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.970 

well<00:01:33.270> what<00:01:33.600> happened<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.080> now<00:01:34.260> on<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.680> they

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
well what happened on now on that they

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.430 
well what happened on now on that they
lift<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.490> need<00:01:35.760> to<00:01:35.850> adjust<00:01:35.910> around<00:01:39.230> laying<00:01:40.230> that

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
lift I need to adjust around laying that

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.710 
lift I need to adjust around laying that
curve<00:01:40.680> up<00:01:40.890> oh<00:01:41.190> yeah<00:01:41.580> your<00:01:41.730> angles<00:01:42.090> much<00:01:42.420> better

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
curve up oh yeah your angles much better

00:01:42.720 --> 00:02:03.210 
curve up oh yeah your angles much better
now<00:01:43.790> here<00:01:44.790> we<00:01:44.940> go

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.950 

think<00:02:04.220> of<00:02:04.310> something<00:02:04.579> and<00:02:04.880> then<00:02:05.000> all<00:02:05.299> of<00:02:05.840> a

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
think of something and then all of a

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.600 
think of something and then all of a
sudden<00:02:05.990> it's<00:02:06.409> being<00:02:06.649> materialized<00:02:07.250> and<00:02:07.520> it

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
sudden it's being materialized and it

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.830 
sudden it's being materialized and it
works<00:02:07.970> I'm<00:02:08.869> just<00:02:09.110> beyond
