00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.870 
that sound I associate the sound with
the<00:01:40.079> behavior<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.770> eventually<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.700> dog

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
the behavior and eventually the dog

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.120 
the behavior and eventually the dog
learns<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.780> tone<00:01:43.110> means<00:01:43.710> for<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.040> to

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
learns that that tone means for it to

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.130 
learns that that tone means for it to
sit<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.880> know<00:01:44.909> if<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.329> just<00:01:45.360> ignore<00:01:45.840> a

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
sit you know if you just ignore a

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.649 
sit you know if you just ignore a
negative<00:01:46.590> behavior<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.640> dogs<00:01:47.909> reward<00:01:48.420> is

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
negative behavior the dogs reward is

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.840 
negative behavior the dogs reward is
doing<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.560> behavior<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.369> if<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.640> keep

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
doing that behavior and if you keep

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.429 
doing that behavior and if you keep
letting<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.180> do<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.509> it's<00:01:51.659> rewarding<00:01:52.140> itself

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
letting it do it it's rewarding itself

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.499 
letting it do it it's rewarding itself
every<00:01:52.710> time<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:53.070> does<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.970> bad<00:01:54.149> dog

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
every time it does the the bad dog

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.859 
every time it does the the bad dog
behavior<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.430> way<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.909> can<00:01:57.299> correct<00:01:57.600> that

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
behavior so this way I can correct that

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.020 
behavior so this way I can correct that
behavior<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.680> never<00:01:59.100> let<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.460> dog<00:01:59.610> get<00:01:59.820> that

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
behavior and never let the dog get that

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.880 
behavior and never let the dog get that
final<00:02:00.479> reward<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.409> can<00:02:01.560> do<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.799> in

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
final reward and I can do it in

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.550 
final reward and I can do it in
different<00:02:01.920> increments<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.719> strengths<00:02:04.380> which

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
different increments and strengths which

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.200 
different increments and strengths which
I<00:02:04.680> really<00:02:04.950> like<00:02:05.100> about<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.520> Blue<00:02:05.640> Fang<00:02:05.880> I'm

about<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.400> progressive<00:03:30.940> technology<00:03:31.840> is<00:03:32.109> that

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
about the progressive technology is that

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.650 
about the progressive technology is that
it<00:03:32.620> starts<00:03:32.950> off<00:03:33.069> very<00:03:33.430> low<00:03:33.669> with<00:03:34.090> just<00:03:34.299> a<00:03:34.389> tone

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
it starts off very low with just a tone

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.289 
it starts off very low with just a tone
not<00:03:35.319> even<00:03:35.560> a<00:03:35.650> stimulus<00:03:36.130> and<00:03:36.519> then<00:03:36.819> a<00:03:36.849> very<00:03:37.060> low

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
not even a stimulus and then a very low

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.349 
not even a stimulus and then a very low
stimulus<00:03:37.930> and<00:03:38.169> then<00:03:38.769> it's<00:03:39.760> more<00:03:39.970> of<00:03:40.060> like<00:03:40.329> a

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
stimulus and then it's more of like a

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.390 
stimulus and then it's more of like a
tickle<00:03:40.870> that<00:03:40.900> then<00:03:41.290> generates<00:03:41.829> into<00:03:42.250> an

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
tickle that then generates into an

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.280 
tickle that then generates into an
annoyance<00:03:42.940> and<00:03:43.239> then<00:03:43.450> if<00:03:43.569> that<00:03:43.720> doesn't<00:03:43.780> work

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
annoyance and then if that doesn't work

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.039 
annoyance and then if that doesn't work
it<00:03:44.440> finally<00:03:44.769> gets<00:03:44.950> to<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.190> large<00:03:45.519> enough<00:03:46.049> shock

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
it finally gets to a large enough shock

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.140 
it finally gets to a large enough shock
to<00:03:47.410> actually<00:03:47.950> fully<00:03:48.489> get<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:48.910> dog's

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
to actually fully get the dog's

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.150 
to actually fully get the dog's
attention<00:03:49.329> to<00:03:50.169> use<00:03:50.349> the<00:03:50.530> electronic<00:03:50.829> fence

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
attention to use the electronic fence

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.069 
attention to use the electronic fence
you<00:03:51.310> bury<00:03:51.579> a<00:03:51.669> wire<00:03:51.940> around<00:03:52.419> the<00:03:52.630> perimeter<00:03:53.049> of

you bury a wire around the perimeter of

you bury a wire around the perimeter of

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
your yard that wire sends out a radio

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.960 
your yard that wire sends out a radio
signal<00:03:55.720> it's<00:03:56.079> picked<00:03:56.319> up<00:03:56.500> by<00:03:56.730> Harrison's<00:03:57.730> blue

fan collar the collar will give the dog

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.759 
fan collar the collar will give the dog
effective<00:04:01.660> stimulus<00:04:02.139> when<00:04:02.319> he<00:04:02.379> gets<00:04:02.530> too

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
effective stimulus when he gets too

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.740 
effective stimulus when he gets too
close<00:04:02.799> to<00:04:03.160> the<00:04:03.280> wire<00:04:03.489> we<00:04:04.030> use<00:04:04.239> corrective

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
close to the wire we use corrective

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.039 
close to the wire we use corrective
stimulus<00:04:05.319> in<00:04:05.530> the<00:04:05.590> most<00:04:06.190> humane<00:04:06.639> way<00:04:06.700> possible

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
stimulus in the most humane way possible

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.710 
stimulus in the most humane way possible
so<00:04:08.049> the<00:04:08.169> shock<00:04:08.410> that<00:04:08.650> we<00:04:08.829> use<00:04:09.160> cannot<00:04:09.760> hurt<00:04:10.180> the

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
so the shock that we use cannot hurt the

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.409 
so the shock that we use cannot hurt the
dog's<00:04:11.410> tissues<00:04:12.160> or<00:04:12.489> you<00:04:12.760> know<00:04:12.849> cells<00:04:13.150> or

dog's tissues or you know cells or

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.960 
dog's tissues or you know cells or
organs<00:04:13.810> it<00:04:14.079> only<00:04:14.560> stimulates<00:04:15.099> nerve<00:04:15.370> endings

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
organs it only stimulates nerve endings
