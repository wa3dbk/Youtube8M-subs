00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:05.899 
so this is the jazz throw it starts with

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:09.070 
so this is the jazz throw it starts with
a<00:00:05.930> catch<00:00:06.529> I<00:00:06.770> turn<00:00:07.129> inside<00:00:07.609> and<00:00:08.030> pull<00:00:08.420> just<00:00:08.930> that

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.080 
a catch I turn inside and pull just that

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.150 
a catch I turn inside and pull just that
simple<00:00:09.470> push<00:00:09.710> throw<00:00:11.800> we're<00:00:12.800> gonna<00:00:12.890> turn

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
simple push throw we're gonna turn

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.000 
simple push throw we're gonna turn
around<00:00:13.280> face<00:00:14.290> 180<00:00:15.290> degrees<00:00:15.590> away<00:00:15.800> from<00:00:15.830> the

around face 180 degrees away from the

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.610 
around face 180 degrees away from the
target<00:00:16.520> and<00:00:16.640> throw<00:00:17.570> that<00:00:17.750> push<00:00:18.110> throw<00:00:18.380> will

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:18.620 
target and throw that push throw will

target and throw that push throw will
look<00:00:18.770> over<00:00:18.920> our<00:00:19.130> right<00:00:19.880> hand<00:00:20.210> and<00:00:20.510> throw<00:00:21.020> then

look over our right hand and throw then
we're<00:00:22.130> gonna<00:00:22.250> slowly<00:00:22.490> but<00:00:22.880> surely<00:00:22.910> move<00:00:23.450> our

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
we're gonna slowly but surely move our

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.900 
we're gonna slowly but surely move our
way<00:00:23.840> around<00:00:24.140> this<00:00:24.320> circle<00:00:24.770> moving<00:00:25.550> further

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
way around this circle moving further

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.560 
way around this circle moving further
and<00:00:26.150> further<00:00:26.300> to<00:00:26.450> our<00:00:26.660> off<00:00:26.990> hand<00:00:27.980> side<00:00:28.570> making

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
and further to our off hand side making

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.930 
and further to our off hand side making
the<00:00:30.410> distance<00:00:30.830> the<00:00:31.010> disc<00:00:31.220> has<00:00:31.400> to<00:00:31.580> travel

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
the distance the disc has to travel

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.319 
the distance the disc has to travel
around<00:00:32.029> the<00:00:32.270> body<00:00:32.480> that<00:00:32.780> much<00:00:33.079> further

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
around the body that much further

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:36.729 
around the body that much further
you're<00:00:35.329> gonna<00:00:35.420> want<00:00:35.690> three<00:00:35.930> to<00:00:36.020> five<00:00:36.230> reps<00:00:36.530> in

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
you're gonna want three to five reps in

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.470 
you're gonna want three to five reps in
each<00:00:36.980> of<00:00:37.190> these<00:00:37.310> positions<00:00:37.579> and<00:00:38.060> here<00:00:38.210> I<00:00:38.239> am

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
each of these positions and here I am

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.510 
each of these positions and here I am
checking<00:00:38.840> it<00:00:39.200> I'm<00:00:39.649> checking<00:00:39.980> it<00:00:40.250> so<00:00:40.370> that<00:00:40.489> I

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
checking it I'm checking it so that I

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.190 
checking it I'm checking it so that I
don't<00:00:40.640> do<00:00:40.940> something<00:00:41.210> silly<00:00:41.570> like<00:00:41.690> put<00:00:42.170> that

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
don't do something silly like put that

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.930 
don't do something silly like put that
rim<00:00:42.890> down<00:00:44.950> when<00:00:45.950> you're<00:00:46.190> working<00:00:46.579> this<00:00:46.700> it's

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
rim down when you're working this it's

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.400 
rim down when you're working this it's
very<00:00:47.180> easy<00:00:47.480> to<00:00:47.600> get<00:00:47.780> all<00:00:47.899> crooked<00:00:48.320> and

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
very easy to get all crooked and

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.650 
very easy to get all crooked and
backwards<00:00:49.030> especially<00:00:50.030> when<00:00:50.149> you're<00:00:50.270> upside

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
backwards especially when you're upside

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.139 
backwards especially when you're upside
down<00:00:50.840> or<00:00:51.110> backwards<00:00:51.469> so<00:00:52.430> we'll<00:00:52.579> check<00:00:52.790> it<00:00:53.000> and

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
down or backwards so we'll check it and

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.069 
down or backwards so we'll check it and
make<00:00:53.210> sure<00:00:53.780> that<00:00:54.520> the<00:00:55.520> rim<00:00:56.300> is<00:00:56.510> oriented<00:00:56.989> in

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
make sure that the rim is oriented in

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.319 
make sure that the rim is oriented in
the<00:00:57.230> appropriate<00:00:57.770> direction<00:00:57.860> once<00:00:58.850> we're<00:00:59.090> set

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
the appropriate direction once we're set

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.540 
the appropriate direction once we're set
and<00:00:59.570> successful<00:01:00.379> in<00:01:00.530> each<00:01:00.710> position<00:01:00.980> then

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
and successful in each position then

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.670 
and successful in each position then
we'll<00:01:01.730> move<00:01:01.879> on<00:01:02.149> and<00:01:02.390> we'll<00:01:03.110> keep<00:01:03.260> doing<00:01:03.320> this

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
we'll move on and we'll keep doing this

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.260 
we'll move on and we'll keep doing this
until<00:01:03.860> we<00:01:04.129> get<00:01:04.309> to<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.609> front<00:01:07.119> so<00:01:08.119> we've

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
until we get to the front so we've

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.569 
until we get to the front so we've
started<00:01:08.569> away<00:01:08.810> from<00:01:09.139> the<00:01:09.229> target<00:01:09.439> and<00:01:09.859> we've

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:10.579 
started away from the target and we've

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:13.149 
started away from the target and we've
worked<00:01:10.819> our<00:01:11.030> way<00:01:11.179> around<00:01:11.299> the<00:01:11.569> circle<00:01:11.979> once<00:01:12.979> we

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
worked our way around the circle once we

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:14.679 
worked our way around the circle once we
get<00:01:13.340> close<00:01:13.579> to<00:01:13.609> the<00:01:13.819> front<00:01:14.179> we're<00:01:14.329> gonna<00:01:14.420> want

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
get close to the front we're gonna want

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.370 
get close to the front we're gonna want
to<00:01:14.749> make<00:01:14.899> sure<00:01:14.929> that<00:01:15.229> we<00:01:15.380> check<00:01:15.649> this<00:01:15.920> throw

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
to make sure that we check this throw

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.719 
to make sure that we check this throw
you<00:01:18.380> see<00:01:18.560> that's<00:01:18.709> a<00:01:18.859> little<00:01:18.979> wobbly<00:01:19.279> so<00:01:19.609> I'm

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
you see that's a little wobbly so I'm

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.999 
you see that's a little wobbly so I'm
gonna<00:01:19.880> check<00:01:20.209> it<00:01:20.389> I'm<00:01:21.049> gonna<00:01:21.229> go<00:01:21.439> three

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
gonna check it I'm gonna go three

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.830 
gonna check it I'm gonna go three
quarters<00:01:22.340> of<00:01:22.369> the<00:01:22.490> way<00:01:22.579> around<00:01:22.700> make<00:01:23.539> sure<00:01:23.719> my

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
quarters of the way around make sure my

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.919 
quarters of the way around make sure my
rim<00:01:24.109> is<00:01:24.350> appropriately<00:01:25.069> set<00:01:25.749> still<00:01:26.749> a<00:01:26.779> little

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
rim is appropriately set still a little

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:28.690 
rim is appropriately set still a little
wobbly<00:01:27.259> you<00:01:27.529> can<00:01:27.679> see<00:01:27.829> the<00:01:27.950> rim<00:01:28.130> pointing<00:01:28.520> down

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
wobbly you can see the rim pointing down

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.370 
wobbly you can see the rim pointing down
a<00:01:28.729> little<00:01:28.999> that<00:01:29.209> rim<00:01:29.539> needs<00:01:29.810> to<00:01:29.990> be<00:01:30.109> up<00:01:30.349> just

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
a little that rim needs to be up just

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.709 
a little that rim needs to be up just
slightly<00:01:31.069> in<00:01:31.670> order<00:01:31.789> for<00:01:32.060> this<00:01:32.149> throw<00:01:32.420> to<00:01:32.479> fly

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
slightly in order for this throw to fly

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:34.149 
slightly in order for this throw to fly
appropriately<00:01:33.469> I'm<00:01:33.740> getting<00:01:33.979> a<00:01:34.009> little

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
appropriately I'm getting a little

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.699 
appropriately I'm getting a little
closer<00:01:34.490> and<00:01:34.819> here<00:01:35.689> we<00:01:35.810> come<00:01:36.020> straight<00:01:36.439> to<00:01:36.619> the

00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:36.709 
closer and here we come straight to the

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:38.709 
closer and here we come straight to the
front<00:01:37.009> you<00:01:37.729> lean<00:01:37.939> forward

00:01:50.769 --> 00:01:50.779 
make it happen we're gonna try to to

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:56.279 
make it happen we're gonna try to to
back<00:01:51.020> chain<00:01:51.349> this<00:01:51.560> into<00:01:51.950> a<00:01:51.979> really<00:01:54.520> alright<00:01:55.579> so
