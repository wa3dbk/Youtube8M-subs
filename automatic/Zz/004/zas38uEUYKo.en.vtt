00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
wire the outside plug from the outside

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.640 
wire the outside plug from the outside
plug<00:01:37.799> into<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.930> an<00:01:39.930> earth<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.530> you're

plug into that an earth that you're

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.609 
plug into that an earth that you're
obviously<00:01:40.740> going<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.130> use<00:01:41.670> from<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.500> from<00:01:43.500> the

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
obviously going to use from the from the

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.590 
obviously going to use from the from the
main<00:01:43.829> hookup<00:01:44.340> facility<00:01:44.790> on<00:01:44.880> your<00:01:45.060> campsite

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
main hookup facility on your campsite

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.090

and also you're going to need another
earth<00:01:47.810> so<00:01:48.810> then<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.079> would<00:01:49.200> even<00:01:49.470> see<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.890> but

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
earth so then it would even see that but

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.760 
earth so then it would even see that but
mine's<00:01:50.509> just<00:01:51.509> up<00:01:51.720> there<00:01:51.990> that's<00:01:52.290> got<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.619> be

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
there's one MCB there which will go in

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.390 
there's one MCB there which will go in
the<00:03:25.100> fridge<00:03:25.430> or<00:03:26.390> similar<00:03:27.230> appliance<00:03:27.680> and<00:03:27.890> then

the fridge or similar appliance and then
the<00:03:28.519> other<00:03:28.640> MCB<00:03:29.269> will<00:03:29.450> go<00:03:29.630> to<00:03:29.690> your<00:03:30.400> cloud

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400

course<00:03:31.730> you<00:03:31.850> can<00:03:31.970> see<00:03:32.150> I<00:03:32.180> fit<00:03:32.630> it<00:03:32.750> up<00:03:32.900> there<00:03:35.140> you

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
course you can see I fit it up there you

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.199 
course you can see I fit it up there you
know<00:03:36.290> so<00:03:36.590> it's<00:03:36.829> not<00:03:36.950> it's<00:03:37.160> not<00:03:37.370> a<00:03:37.430> difficult

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
know so it's not it's not a difficult

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.530 
know so it's not it's not a difficult
job<00:03:38.480> and<00:03:39.640> wouldn't<00:03:40.640> shy<00:03:40.880> away<00:03:41.060> from<00:03:41.239> it

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
job and wouldn't shy away from it

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.750 
job and wouldn't shy away from it
particularly<00:03:42.079> the<00:03:42.290> only<00:03:42.500> sort<00:03:43.160> of<00:03:43.220> dodgy<00:03:43.400> bit

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
particularly the only sort of dodgy bit

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.240 
particularly the only sort of dodgy bit
is<00:03:43.910> really<00:03:44.200> maybe<00:03:45.200> cut<00:03:45.500> in<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.739> hole<00:03:45.920> filling

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
is really maybe cut in the hole filling

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.180 
is really maybe cut in the hole filling
to<00:03:46.609> the<00:03:46.810> outside<00:03:47.810> Inlet<00:03:50.739> and<00:03:51.739> that's<00:03:51.980> it

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
to the outside Inlet and that's it

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.420 
to the outside Inlet and that's it
really<00:03:52.430> it<00:03:53.239> really<00:03:53.269> isn't<00:03:53.630> that<00:03:53.780> difficult

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
really it really isn't that difficult

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.670 
really it really isn't that difficult
but<00:03:55.430> say<00:03:55.640> our<00:03:55.819> kits<00:03:56.120> come<00:03:56.359> with<00:03:56.680> complete

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
but say our kits come with complete

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.410 
but say our kits come with complete
instructions<00:03:59.049> you<00:04:00.049> know<00:04:00.140> step<00:04:00.470> by<00:04:00.650> step<00:04:01.420> so

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
instructions you know step by step so

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.190 
instructions you know step by step so
you<00:04:02.450> can't<00:04:03.079> really<00:04:03.350> go<00:04:03.739> wrong<00:04:04.120> but<00:04:05.170> you<00:04:06.170> know

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
you can't really go wrong but you know

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.020 
you can't really go wrong but you know
you<00:04:06.350> should<00:04:06.650> really<00:04:06.950> get<00:04:07.220> it<00:04:07.340> checked<00:04:07.609> out<00:04:07.819> by

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
you should really get it checked out by
