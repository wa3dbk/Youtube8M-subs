00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.700 

I<00:00:17.810> started<00:00:18.810> with<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.930> base<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.410> my<00:00:19.560> foundation

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
I started with a base of my foundation

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.890 
I started with a base of my foundation
mixed<00:00:20.580> with<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.850> little<00:00:21.029> bit<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.240> white<00:00:21.539> to

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
mixed with a little bit of white to

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.509 
mixed with a little bit of white to
lighten<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.260> color<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.769> then<00:00:23.070> blended<00:00:23.400> that

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
lighten the color and then blended that

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:35.030 
lighten the color and then blended that
out

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.650 

with<00:00:36.040> a<00:00:36.070> bright<00:00:36.370> red<00:00:36.400> eyeshadow<00:00:36.760> I<00:00:37.330> started

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
with a bright red eyeshadow I started

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.820 
with a bright red eyeshadow I started
winging<00:00:37.960> out<00:00:38.050> the<00:00:38.230> shape<00:00:38.410> of<00:00:38.440> my<00:00:38.680> eyes

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
winging out the shape of my eyes

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.340 
winging out the shape of my eyes
focusing<00:00:39.580> on<00:00:39.700> my<00:00:39.820> left<00:00:40.030> but<00:00:40.690> also<00:00:40.840> applying<00:00:41.230> a

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
focusing on my left but also applying a

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.540 
focusing on my left but also applying a
bit<00:00:41.470> to<00:00:41.590> the<00:00:41.680> right<00:00:41.710> eye<00:00:41.890> just<00:00:42.310> so<00:00:42.400> it<00:00:42.460> would

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
bit to the right eye just so it would

00:00:42.550 --> 00:01:07.330 
bit to the right eye just so it would
have<00:00:42.640> a<00:00:42.700> faint<00:00:42.970> tinge<00:00:43.240> later<00:00:43.600> on

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.950 

item<00:01:08.340> took<00:01:08.550> a<00:01:08.700> black<00:01:08.940> shadow<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.330> created<00:01:09.870> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
item took a black shadow and created the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.660 
item took a black shadow and created the
same<00:01:10.140> shape<00:01:10.440> applying<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.250> close<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.580> the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
same shape applying it close to the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:32.110 
same shape applying it close to the
lashline<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.360> then<00:01:12.450> blending<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.840> upwards

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.320 

I<00:01:32.860> used<00:01:33.860> a<00:01:34.040> light<00:01:34.220> gray<00:01:34.460> shadow<00:01:34.760> to<00:01:34.910> start

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
I used a light gray shadow to start

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.660 
I used a light gray shadow to start
mapping<00:01:35.450> out<00:01:35.690> the<00:01:35.840> skull<00:01:36.080> contours<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:37.490> gray

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
mapping out the skull contours the gray

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.280 
mapping out the skull contours the gray
is<00:01:37.790> a<00:01:37.820> lot<00:01:38.060> more<00:01:38.240> forgiving<00:01:38.750> and<00:01:38.870> then<00:01:38.990> jumping

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
is a lot more forgiving and then jumping

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.990 
is a lot more forgiving and then jumping
in<00:01:39.440> with<00:01:39.620> a<00:01:39.650> black<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:40.280> let<00:01:40.610> me<00:01:40.730> determine

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
in with a black and let me determine

00:01:41.000 --> 00:02:09.749 
in with a black and let me determine
where<00:01:41.270> I<00:01:41.300> wanted<00:01:41.600> everything<00:01:41.810> to<00:01:41.960> be<00:01:42.140> placed

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.340 

once<00:02:10.759> happy<00:02:11.150> with<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.420> outline<00:02:11.720> I<00:02:12.050> went<00:02:12.260> in

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
once happy with the outline I went in

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.020 
once happy with the outline I went in
with<00:02:12.500> darker<00:02:12.890> Gray's<00:02:13.100> to<00:02:13.130> start<00:02:13.580> shadowing

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
with darker Gray's to start shadowing

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.430 
with darker Gray's to start shadowing
areas<00:02:14.390> of<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.660> skull<00:02:16.569> for<00:02:17.569> my<00:02:17.720> eye<00:02:17.750> area<00:02:18.200> I

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
areas of the skull for my eye area I

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.990 
areas of the skull for my eye area I
didn't<00:02:18.800> want<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:19.010> just<00:02:19.130> have<00:02:19.340> a<00:02:19.370> black<00:02:19.700> circle

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
didn't want to just have a black circle

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.730 
didn't want to just have a black circle
so<00:02:20.450> I<00:02:20.480> tried<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.900> build<00:02:20.990> up<00:02:21.140> different<00:02:21.290> shapes

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
so I tried to build up different shapes

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.830 
so I tried to build up different shapes
with<00:02:22.100> varying<00:02:22.459> levels<00:02:22.490> of<00:02:22.850> darkness<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.720> give

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
with varying levels of darkness to give

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.449 
with varying levels of darkness to give
the<00:02:23.989> idea<00:02:24.260> of<00:02:24.440> recessed<00:02:24.770> bone<00:02:24.980> structures

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
the idea of recessed bone structures

00:02:25.459 --> 00:03:09.240 
the idea of recessed bone structures
within<00:02:25.850> it

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.410 

building<00:03:10.250> up<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.459> gray<00:03:10.610> shadows<00:03:10.970> from<00:03:11.180> light

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
building up the gray shadows from light

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.479 
building up the gray shadows from light
to<00:03:11.569> dark<00:03:11.810> was<00:03:12.080> especially<00:03:12.620> helpful<00:03:12.860> in<00:03:13.160> areas

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
to dark was especially helpful in areas

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.420 
to dark was especially helpful in areas
that<00:03:13.610> were<00:03:13.730> meant<00:03:13.910> to<00:03:13.970> fade<00:03:14.180> out<00:03:14.209> on<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.540> edges

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
that were meant to fade out on the edges

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.740 
that were meant to fade out on the edges
blending<00:03:16.430> the<00:03:16.519> gray<00:03:16.670> into<00:03:16.940> my<00:03:17.030> skintone<00:03:17.450> first

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
blending the gray into my skintone first

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.509 
blending the gray into my skintone first
made<00:03:18.110> a<00:03:18.140> much<00:03:18.349> easier<00:03:18.530> base<00:03:18.950> for<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.310> black

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
made a much easier base for the black

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:52.260 
made a much easier base for the black
later<00:03:19.790> on

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.820 

for<00:03:53.270> larger<00:03:53.600> areas<00:03:53.960> I<00:03:54.230> used<00:03:54.440> a<00:03:54.560> stiffer

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
for larger areas I used a stiffer

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.710 
for larger areas I used a stiffer
contour<00:03:55.340> brush<00:03:55.550> to<00:03:55.820> blend<00:03:56.000> out<00:03:56.180> the<00:03:56.330> shadows

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
contour brush to blend out the shadows

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.320 
contour brush to blend out the shadows
this<00:03:57.620> helps<00:03:57.920> cover<00:03:58.130> more<00:03:58.550> area<00:03:58.910> but<00:03:59.180> also

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
this helps cover more area but also

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.850 
this helps cover more area but also
makes<00:03:59.660> the<00:03:59.810> blend<00:04:00.020> a<00:04:00.110> lot<00:04:00.290> softer<00:04:00.500> and

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
makes the blend a lot softer and

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:14.400 
makes the blend a lot softer and
natural-looking

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.539 

once<00:04:15.410> you<00:04:15.560> start<00:04:15.770> going<00:04:15.920> in<00:04:16.130> with<00:04:16.250> the<00:04:16.340> black

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
once you start going in with the black

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.580 
once you start going in with the black
focus<00:04:17.209> it<00:04:17.359> to<00:04:17.480> the<00:04:17.570> areas<00:04:17.870> you<00:04:17.900> want<00:04:18.200> to<00:04:18.320> appear

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
focus it to the areas you want to appear

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.890 
focus it to the areas you want to appear
deepest<00:04:18.980> I<00:04:19.340> started<00:04:20.090> with<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:20.269> eye<00:04:20.299> since<00:04:20.780> it

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
deepest I started with the eye since it

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.510 
deepest I started with the eye since it
would<00:04:20.959> be<00:04:21.019> the<00:04:21.170> most<00:04:21.380> recessed<00:04:21.829> and<00:04:22.190> then<00:04:22.340> four

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
would be the most recessed and then four

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.340 
would be the most recessed and then four
areas<00:04:22.850> on<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:23.090> cheek<00:04:23.330> you<00:04:23.360> can<00:04:23.600> use<00:04:23.870> leftover

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
areas on the cheek you can use leftover

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.170 
areas on the cheek you can use leftover
black<00:04:24.560> on<00:04:24.710> the<00:04:24.800> brush<00:04:25.040> to<00:04:25.340> darken<00:04:25.700> those<00:04:25.790> areas

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
black on the brush to darken those areas

00:04:26.180 --> 00:05:54.050 
black on the brush to darken those areas
without<00:04:26.390> completely<00:04:26.840> being<00:04:27.170> opaque

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.530 

I<00:05:55.280> used<00:05:56.280> a<00:05:56.430> gel<00:05:56.610> liner<00:05:56.850> to<00:05:57.150> fill<00:05:57.180> in<00:05:57.419> my

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
I used a gel liner to fill in my

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.390 
I used a gel liner to fill in my
waterlines<00:05:58.050> and<00:05:58.440> deep<00:05:58.740> in<00:05:58.889> the<00:05:59.010> cat<00:05:59.220> eye<00:05:59.250> shape

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
waterlines and deep in the cat eye shape

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:08.180 
waterlines and deep in the cat eye shape
on<00:05:59.880> my<00:06:00.090> left<00:06:00.300> eye<00:06:00.450> for<00:06:06.410> the<00:06:07.410> mouth<00:06:07.590> I<00:06:07.860> quickly

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
on my left eye for the mouth I quickly

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.159 
on my left eye for the mouth I quickly
laid<00:06:08.370> down<00:06:08.580> a<00:06:08.639> red<00:06:09.000> base<00:06:09.180> on<00:06:09.480> my<00:06:09.600> lips<00:06:09.840> and<00:06:10.110> then

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
laid down a red base on my lips and then

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:12.260
