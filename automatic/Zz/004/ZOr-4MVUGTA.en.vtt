00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
for some reason I think this usually

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.640 
for some reason I think this usually
retails<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:28.890> Amazon<00:00:29.490> for<00:00:29.840> $35<00:00:30.840> which<00:00:31.500> is

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
reason I think they were overstocked

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.520 
reason I think they were overstocked
because<00:00:36.210> no<00:00:36.450> one<00:00:36.600> was<00:00:36.719> freaking<00:00:37.140> buying<00:00:37.350> it
