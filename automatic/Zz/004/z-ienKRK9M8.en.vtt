 it is beyond a great game it must be 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.540
 great consecration of platinum games 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.880
 Whoever said that was with a lob director. 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.189

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.930
 the staff of the casting inner circle 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.970

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.970
 that the nightclub does not do well 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.380

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.560
 Fell in the galley, we'll see. 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.930

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.799

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.079
 also ordering to see in the combos in game 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.689
 here doing freestyle football by carlito 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.520
 soon our legacy with bilal brings a new 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.229
 hat model that works almost like 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.880
 a chainsaw is spinning it 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.149
 the guy has teeth and the tongue is spoken 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.430
 very simplistic and close the goal 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.750
 also in the play but it seems that only for 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.910
 who makes the purchase 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.770
 and then the video was good to want a 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.810
 player and became famous car after 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.090
 to dub is all the main characters 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.510
 to leave the last 100 games to the industry 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.040
 huh 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.080
 and now it's in metal gear solid 5 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.310
 He also said that the game is the biggest 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.650
 game he has seen in life that is for the 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.540
 sinistra the shoe well the one that encompasses the 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.490
 rocking in the background well said that 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.870
 very anxious to see what the crowd is going 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.660
 ready in game 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.330
 according to him the game is really huge in 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.700
 all meanings saying that skyrim is 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.100
 close the possibilities there 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.860
 was also offered to close the property 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.580
 praised that by forcing his speech he 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.560
 did not 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.930
 on playstation xperia saying that the 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.940
 guy gave a shake to fans who twisted 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.709
 nose there when they knew he would be 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.450
 the snake and had no anger 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.430
 now let's go then beautiful opinion 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.110
 My opinion I think david raiter 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.190
 who made the black voice in all the others 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.170
 series games 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.820
 he has his merit and he has done very well 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.709
 who knows me knows I 'm very very 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.570
 fan of the show and now I 'm feeding myself 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.400
 a breakfast with metal gear more than 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.900
 never and I have to agree with the 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.880
 kojima guy likes to express 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.830
 emotions not only in words that were the 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.140
 and he did not have much of the 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.660
 dynamics in his voice in intonation already 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.340
 feature of the NEC and now it's time 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.220
 expressed by facial expression by the 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.140
 Voice quality is the tone and 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.040
 Class name in this in my opinion. 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.140
 what do you think 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.880
 It was September had a crazy guy that 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.040
 made a kind of notebook that 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.640
 xbox games a year later he went there and 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.280
 made of ps4 pedro 3061 screwing 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.120
 courage but now decided to end the 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.880
 fight of the champions 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.489
 oddly enough it is to say that if 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.959
 overcame and created a kind of notebook 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.350
 Play as many playstation 4 games 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:55.230
 as the xbox one o play box as it was 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.700
 baptism brings the ps4 on the left 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.280
 xbox the right angle 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.160
 and all this with a 22 inch screen 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.570
 and a body made with the aid of 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.730
 a 3d printer 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.799
 this do not expect to run games from both 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.950
 consoles at the same time as the unit 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.660
 all there is only one power cord and 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.790
 only the appliance can be switched on per month 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.350
 the device is of course not made for the 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.200
 sale, but due to a special request 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.419
 of a customer of zero but due to his 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.060
 assembly complexity and high cost 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.970
 involved and should be much more expensive than 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.160
 playbook 4 xbox one year 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.830
 he commented that it was a game of 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.450
 playstation 4 xbox one year and only for 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.120
 remember that these models leave a 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:38.090
 Each console has already gone in the 2,000 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.010
 and $ 500 more while I would be 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.630
 willing to pay for a machine like this 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.190
 And for those who do not know today, 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.360
 nintendo melts there were many 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.220
 Information is very cool. 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.840
 interesting together in the many kra 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.580
 management how to comply 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.500
 Look, I just do birthday on the 12th of 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.690
 February and apparently not only Nintendo 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.890
 you know how you decided to give 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.260
 the next day 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.690
 because February 3 will be 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.060
 not just the official launch day 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.400
 the nilton and s here in the West as 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.290
 also the day of release of zelda 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.240
 majora's mexico in vicky 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.030
 in addition it was announced urban 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.860
 wonderful from nintendo ds excel with 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.720
 game then be smart not to lose 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.610
 the chance to give me a gift is summer 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.520
 For you it's mine, but not everything. 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.860
 are flowers learned that the nilton ms 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.360
 does not come with a charger that same 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.540
 some reason no one thought it would be a 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.220
 bullshit is not a good idea since 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.590
 in designing them everyone buy one 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.830
 new 3ds should already have some ds can give 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:36.050
 in the hallways is a crazy go with courage 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.360
 or you can buy the 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.230
 separately on an average of $ 10 a 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.910
 pretty ounce, right? 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.680
 here in Brazil to arrive more or less 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.479
 so in the conversion they do for 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.310
 about 180 reais 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:48.410
 but if you have a river you can celebrate 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:51.020
 because several wii titles 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:53.570
 will now be available on the river already 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.790
 at the beginning of the month the games do not appear in the 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.560
 river menu just like any other 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.180
 console software without 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.240
 you need to change the 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.590
 compatibility with this is of course not 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.000
 was it that the steering wheel yet 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.550
 a lot of things then, knowing about 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.640
 everything kind of looks the tim this site there 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:13.130
