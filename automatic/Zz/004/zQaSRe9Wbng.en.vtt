00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
already have I think for game plays with

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.660 
already have I think for game plays with
the<00:02:50.910> shovel<00:02:51.090> submission<00:02:51.600> game<00:02:51.950> mp5<00:02:52.950> isn't<00:02:53.580> the

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
the shovel submission game mp5 isn't the

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.490 
the shovel submission game mp5 isn't the
best<00:02:53.910> gameplay<00:02:54.270> but<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.870> ones<00:02:55.020> after<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.410> is

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
best gameplay but the ones after that is

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.490 
best gameplay but the ones after that is
good<00:02:55.590> so<00:02:56.070> just<00:02:56.610> look<00:02:56.880> at<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.420> have<00:02:58.020> a<00:02:58.050> mp5
