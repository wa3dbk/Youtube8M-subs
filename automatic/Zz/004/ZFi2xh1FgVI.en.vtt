00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.160
 hello welcome on how 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.410
 photograph points like I'm going to you 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.330
 talk about the focal doubler so a 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.650
 focal doubler what's the point but 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.330
 sometimes under certain conditions when 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.920
 we shoot and we did not 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.690
 we can not get closer to the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.449
 subject and we have an optics that is a 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.680
 not very light in terms of focal length 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.810
 I already told you about it in another 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.980
 video we will use to a device a 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.119
 utensil that is grafted a 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.439
 goal called a doubler of 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.989
 focal ie that we will multiply 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.059
 the focus of the lens pardo there I am 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.540
 with my blood 400 and I try to take 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.730
 a picture of my head of yen deols but 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.559
 I feel that the 400 mm is not enough 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.059
 powerful so I'm going to use a 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.530
 doubler of focal length it's a doubler 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.780
 multiplied by two his multiplied 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.879
 focal length by two so 400 I'm going 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.520
 to go to 800 mm which is still 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.110
 super interesting though 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.149
 the use of a focal doubler 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.660
 is not without compensation 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.000
 I'll go sometimes we'll lose the bet 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.979
 auto point on the camera to 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.470
 lose autofocus 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.479
 then we will lose in brightness and 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.460
 then we will lose in image quality 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.229
 so there is still I used a 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.390
 double focal it's not trivial it's not 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.750
 without risk there is still a price to 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.460
 pay 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.110
 but despite everything bombay after that it's up to 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.070
 you measure and weigh the for and the 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.490
 against is the game worth the 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.470
 candle 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.820
 and that is to have an advantage 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.130
 multiply the focal length by 2 or 1 5 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.040
 according to the doublers there are 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.500
 several types of pain manage it's 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.060
 also to a reasonable sum having 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.540
 optical gradient there it allows me to have 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.500
 a 800 mm for a fee of 300 euros to 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.510
 around 300 euros 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.360
 know what's interesting so I 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:55.470
 make a first picture of my head of 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:02:01.160
 gones hop that's it then i'm going to turn off 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:08.420
 my camera three shots and optics 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:08.420
 here and I will put the doubler 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:18.660
 here is hop we remove the cap 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.950
 it puts them in place here I am relieving 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.890
 normally I should have fixed myself on the 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:27.870
 direct cost then I was in 400 so I 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.230
 let's go I'll go up to 800 mm 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.970
 that's what it gives me that's what 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.420
 I had just now and that's what 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.590
 I have now final Thursday here at 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.750
 what will serve a focal doubler 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.480
 so it's a tool a very tool 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.440
 interesting which can be very useful if 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.360
 you will allow us to reach 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.720
 focal length very interesting to a lesser 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.810
 cost 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.980
 so we think about this opportunity if 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.239
 it never had to come to you 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.620
 here I thank you for your 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.180
 attention I tell you very soon 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.799

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.650
 how to photograph points like and 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.760
 thanks to you for being ever more 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.390
