well but that is definitely going to

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.219 
well but that is definitely going to
impact<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.909> GTA<00:01:39.240> online<00:01:39.299> DLC<00:01:39.960> because<00:01:40.110> they're

the lowrider DLC that's still up there

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.410 
the lowrider DLC that's still up there
that<00:01:56.250> was<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.490> one<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> lot<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:56.939> modders<00:01:57.270> and

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
that was the one a lot of modders and

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.149 
that was the one a lot of modders and
leakers<00:01:57.689> we're<00:01:57.930> talking<00:01:58.229> about<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.680> few<00:01:59.009> weeks

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
leakers we're talking about a few weeks

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.219 
leakers we're talking about a few weeks
ago<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.969> one<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.299> think<00:02:00.450> makes<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.110> most

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
ago the one that I think makes the most

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.770 
ago the one that I think makes the most
sense<00:02:01.530> would<00:02:02.310> be<00:02:02.520> some<00:02:02.880> sort<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.180> mansion

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
sense would be some sort of mansion

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.120 
sense would be some sort of mansion

why<00:02:13.890> in<00:02:14.550> my<00:02:14.790> opinion<00:02:14.820> why<00:02:15.510> would<00:02:15.750> they<00:02:15.960> do<00:02:16.440> the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
why in my opinion why would they do the

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.650 
why in my opinion why would they do the
next<00:02:16.890> DLC<00:02:17.430> after<00:02:17.730> everybody<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:18.180> loaded<00:02:18.630> with

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
next DLC after everybody is loaded with

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.680 
next DLC after everybody is loaded with
money<00:02:18.870> as<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.920> low-life<00:02:20.460> or<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.760> lowrider<00:02:21.120> DLC

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
money as a low-life or a lowrider DLC

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.020 
money as a low-life or a lowrider DLC
you<00:02:21.810> know<00:02:21.930> something<00:02:22.350> that<00:02:22.500> wouldn't<00:02:23.370> cost<00:02:23.730> as

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
you know something that wouldn't cost as

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.940 
you know something that wouldn't cost as
much<00:02:24.090> where<00:02:24.810> if<00:02:24.900> they<00:02:24.990> did<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.320> like<00:02:25.500> really

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
much where if they did this like really

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.600 
much where if they did this like really
really<00:02:26.280> high-end<00:02:27.110> mansion<00:02:28.110> /<00:02:28.620> whatever<00:02:28.920> DLC

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
really high-end mansion / whatever DLC

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.670 
really high-end mansion / whatever DLC
obviously<00:02:30.450> management<00:02:30.900> should<00:02:31.020> cost<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.440> ton

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
obviously management should cost a ton

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.260 
obviously management should cost a ton
of<00:02:31.740> money<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.190> they<00:02:32.280> probably<00:02:32.460> will<00:02:32.760> they

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
of money and they probably will they

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.120 
of money and they probably will they
could<00:02:33.450> throw<00:02:33.750> in<00:02:33.900> some<00:02:34.140> new<00:02:34.290> sports<00:02:34.770> cars

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
could throw in some new sports cars

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.920 
could throw in some new sports cars
maybe<00:02:35.460> even<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.850> supercar<00:02:36.300> even<00:02:36.600> though<00:02:36.720> I'm

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
maybe even a supercar even though I'm

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.050 
maybe even a supercar even though I'm
kind<00:02:36.960> of<00:02:37.230> good<00:02:37.350> on<00:02:37.410> supercars<00:02:37.920> but<00:02:38.550> you<00:02:38.940> know

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
kind of good on supercars but you know

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.210 
kind of good on supercars but you know
they<00:02:39.270> could<00:02:39.420> do<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.570> bunch<00:02:40.020> of<00:02:40.200> stuff<00:02:40.260> high-end

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
they could do a bunch of stuff high-end

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.880 
they could do a bunch of stuff high-end
clothing<00:02:41.520> I<00:02:42.060> don't<00:02:42.330> know<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:43.110> would<00:02:43.680> force

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
clothing I don't know and it would force

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.250 
clothing I don't know and it would force
people<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.130> spend<00:02:44.370> their<00:02:44.490> money<00:02:44.700> now<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:45.660> could

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
people to spend their money now I could

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.950 
people to spend their money now I could
be<00:02:46.350> wrong<00:02:46.380> but<00:02:46.770> I<00:02:46.980> think<00:02:47.490> that<00:02:48.060> would<00:02:48.780> be

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
be wrong but I think that would be

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.200 
be wrong but I think that would be
something<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.410> a<00:02:49.860> ton<00:02:50.520> of<00:02:50.550> people<00:02:50.940> would

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
something that a ton of people would

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.660 
something that a ton of people would
want<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.450> see<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:51.870> maybe<00:02:52.440> an<00:02:52.740> idea<00:02:53.100> that<00:02:53.370> could

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
want to see and maybe an idea that could

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.280 
want to see and maybe an idea that could
possibly<00:02:54.150> be<00:02:54.270> already<00:02:54.510> happening<00:02:54.930> when<00:02:55.110> we

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
possibly be already happening when we

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.320 
possibly be already happening when we
don't<00:02:55.470> know<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.310> single-player<00:02:56.790> DLC

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
don't know the the single-player DLC

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.360 
don't know the the single-player DLC
maybe<00:02:57.600> there<00:02:57.810> is<00:02:57.960> going<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.260> be<00:02:58.290> somewhat<00:02:59.130> or

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
maybe there is going to be somewhat or

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.370 
maybe there is going to be somewhat or
maybe<00:02:59.460> it's<00:02:59.640> going<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.850> tie<00:03:00.030> into<00:03:00.320> GTA<00:03:01.320> online

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
maybe it's going to tie into GTA online

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.770 
maybe it's going to tie into GTA online
a<00:03:01.650> little<00:03:02.070> bit<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.400> instead<00:03:03.360> of<00:03:03.450> just<00:03:03.600> having

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
a little bit and instead of just having

standpoint<00:04:35.380> it's<00:04:35.830> probably<00:04:36.100> easier<00:04:36.520> to<00:04:36.550> do

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
standpoint it's probably easier to do

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:39.330 
standpoint it's probably easier to do
two-part<00:04:37.300> DLC<00:04:37.690> just<00:04:37.960> because<00:04:38.229> it's<00:04:38.410> it's<00:04:38.979> sort

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
two-part DLC just because it's it's sort

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.129 
two-part DLC just because it's it's sort
of<00:04:39.430> the<00:04:39.550> same<00:04:39.759> theme<00:04:40.120> so<00:04:40.360> they<00:04:40.449> need<00:04:40.630> to<00:04:40.660> do<00:04:40.870> as

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
of the same theme so they need to do as

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.620 
of the same theme so they need to do as
much<00:04:41.199> work<00:04:41.860> but<00:04:42.160> I<00:04:42.430> mean<00:04:42.580> especially<00:04:42.880> the<00:04:43.270> dlc

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630
