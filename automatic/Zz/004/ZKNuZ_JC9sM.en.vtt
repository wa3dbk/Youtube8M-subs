00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
all of it as quick as I can before we

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.999 
all of it as quick as I can before we
start<00:00:28.530> so<00:00:28.740> toy<00:00:28.949> field<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.610> basically<00:00:30.600> a<00:00:31.009> minute

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
start so toy field is basically a minute

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.410 
start so toy field is basically a minute
it's<00:00:32.129> not<00:00:32.189> it's<00:00:32.489> kind<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.820> like<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.000> mini<00:00:33.210> game

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420

it's not it's kind of like a mini game
but<00:00:33.600> it's<00:00:33.719> not<00:00:33.809> it's<00:00:34.409> not<00:00:34.530> much<00:00:34.679> in<00:00:34.859> the

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:34.949 
but it's not it's not much in the

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.860 
but it's not it's not much in the
minions<00:00:35.309> area<00:00:37.460> so<00:00:38.460> toy<00:00:38.819> field<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.390> basically<00:00:39.510> a

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
minions area so toy field is basically a

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.619 
minions area so toy field is basically a
batter<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.649> batting<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.640> your<00:00:41.909> goal<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.479> to
