00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.930
 what against the second trailer to gta 5 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:30.199
 is outside and we look together 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:30.199
 held annually 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.200
 Franconia 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.150
 on the 11th 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.570
 Peter Moore Parker Posey 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.489
 The woman looking to outlook exchange 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.990
 bams 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.570
 red 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.149
 6 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:06.490
 nice nice afford it usually means so me 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.250
 I must honestly say I have 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.459
 not much information about the game yet 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.200
 read 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.850
 I have not had the time and I have not yet 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.200
 make this video quite spontaneously 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.480
 That's why I still do not know that 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.430
 much of the play also from the 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.480
 saw trailer that we will 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.280
 repeat it and then they will 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.670
 to address in the next show 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.640
 my first impression of the trailer looks 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.190
 unbelievably cool by heart first ne 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:35.319
 hammer graphic the trailer also great 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.750
 cool music selection is so funky and funky 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.580
 I die music I find that cool 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.709
 just things immediately wacky 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.180
 fields pass the fans a bit 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.700
 pity its gp11 4 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.260
 rockstar a bit this 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.660
 realistic rail is driven and 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.140
 dj was always a question of age 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.340
 were actually so full up game 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.400
 displays is when you look over it 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.410
 I think I think that they are the f5 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.840
 just as closed off as it is 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:06.459
 but Andreas, I can imagine 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.220
 that it will be better than td4 and it 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.209
 is cool so i was sometimes 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.790
 turned off is the overdrawn 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.820
 if I'm cool and I exaggerated 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.840
 still good that the edf five 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.160
 probably back in this direction 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.650
 what else can you say? 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.620
 the game world must be like that 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.750
 be awesome I know that 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.459
 i think is bigger than cds san 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:32.290
 andreas and the day4 together like that 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:36.220
 Hard to be so tough 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.900
 we stop in san andreas in los 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.630
 santos so a copy of go 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.760
 angeles and the surrounding area but not anymore 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:48.930
 let's do that so the las vegas 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:50.950
 knock off and san francisco coppi 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.600
 these cities are no longer the two 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:57.609
 only los Santos and the surrounding area 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.750
 huge playing surface so well say so me 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:00.010
 think that will be a very cool 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.000
 Playground if I can imagine 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.940
 that she will be really alive 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.160
 which makes me happy that so many again 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.200
 Many hobbies have to take so much 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.970
 we have seen that since he the 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.050
 the type of mother post drives me 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.120
 See that you can golf that one 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.620
 you can play tennis 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.109
 Parachuting can be cool too 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.760
 finally she gives the planes one too 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.150
 super thing this chats and his 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.100
 I 'm looking forward to that 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.440
 trailer looks good when again a 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.980
 bit closer to that at the 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.420
 next job 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.420
 otherwise it was the
