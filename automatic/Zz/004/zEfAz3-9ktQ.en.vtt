00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.080
 wait for those imminent changes that 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.550
 will come from tomorrow in good 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.710
 part of the country at the moment for today as 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.570
 we say very similar situation very 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.059
 similar continue to enter their systems 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.830
 front those mass fronts of 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.330
 cloud fronts that continue to leave 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.119
 precipitation in northwest areas 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.590
 it will also continue to rain during 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.109
 good part of the day towards galicia 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.180
 asturias some drop that also 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.010
 will play north of castile and lion with 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.199
 more only in our regions and day 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.820
 also very quiet in the Balearic Islands and in 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.739
 the Canarian archipelago temperatures 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.210
 for today they will continue to be quite 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.059
 hot in a good part of the country although 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.680
 already descend moderately towards the 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.110
 third north we see it with more details 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.240
 in a few minutes 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.550
 good morning to one and we will continue talking 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.580
 of a very stable day in good part 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.080
 of the country and it will be from tomorrow 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.730
 when some changes come 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.350
 moment as we say for today because 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.080
 situation very similar to that of 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.910
 last days is still going 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.739
 cloud masses by the northwest are 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.960
 leaving again rainfall and 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.120
 heavens more covered in areas 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.820
 of galicia in pontevedra in a coruña in 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.920
 lugo is would also extend those rains 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.750
 towards asturias including lion palencia and 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.780
 leaving some cloudiness a little thing 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.240
 in the rest of the north of the country with only 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.340
 one more day in much of Spain 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.619
 in the morning we return to identify those 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.100
 low type clouds in areas of Málaga 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.690
 Cadiz ceuta will tend to dissipate 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.009
 quickly throughout the morning and 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.990
 some cloudiness that we could 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.550
 find also in areas of cataluña 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.990
 in baleares very calm day what 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.690
 same with the Canarian archipelago with 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.060
 predominance of sun and temperatures that 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.060
 yesterday for example they left us values 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.340
 really summers 34 degrees in zones 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.560
 from huelva from murcia de valencia also 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.600
 so the interior in Seville for today 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.620
 we will continue talking about heat in these 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.810
 zones temperatures 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.700
 They are typical for this time of year 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.410
 decoration with sections and already descend from 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.240
 new thermometers in northern areas 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.730
 yesterday in san sebastián for example 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.510
 maximum of 30 hey if they normalize those 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.510
 thermometric values 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.980
 the country is even now at eight o'clock and 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.050
 five in the morning temperatures very 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.970
 soft look because the maximum 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.920
 will again exceed 30 degrees in 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.870
 many regions of the southern half 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.360
 peninsular already for today we hope that 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.190
 descend those maximum values in the 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.060
 northern third peninsular and as for the 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.010
 state of heaven 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.080
 today we will continue talking about few 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.880
 changes is still saying is quite 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.560
 covered in galicia areas are 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.570
 leaving even rainfall in good 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.120
 part of this community arriving 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.730
 Asturias to the north of Castilla León 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.620
 in zamora in the rest day that returns 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.810
 to be marked by the clear rivers at 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.030
 as in the Balearics and sun also for 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.040
 the Canarian archipelago changes to the 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.709
 seen changes that will already happen to 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.239
 from tomorrow and that will affect good 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.550
 part of the country as the 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.700
 rainy days and descent of the 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.700
 temperatures
