nuts that I want you to know it's called
the<00:00:44.010> star<00:00:44.399> method<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.000> what<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.899> does<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.289> it's

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
the star method and what it does is it's

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.440 
the star method and what it does is it's
a<00:00:46.590> tightening<00:00:47.160> sequence<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.910> ensures<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
a tightening sequence that ensures the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.680 
a tightening sequence that ensures the
wheel<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:48.870> tightened<00:00:49.260> down<00:00:49.320> flat<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.430> true<00:00:50.690> to

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
wheel is tightened down flat and true to

wheel is tightened down flat and true to
the<00:00:51.809> spindle<00:00:52.050> if<00:00:52.379> your<00:00:53.190> wheel<00:00:53.340> was<00:00:53.550> tightened

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
the spindle if your wheel was tightened

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.189 
the spindle if your wheel was tightened
down<00:00:53.910> crooked<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.510> course<00:00:54.809> it's<00:00:54.989> going<00:00:55.140> to

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
down crooked of course it's going to

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.200 
down crooked of course it's going to
wobble<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.550> faster<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:56.940> go<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.090> worse

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
wobble and the faster you go the worse

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.610 
wobble and the faster you go the worse
it's<00:00:57.570> going<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.870> wobble<00:00:58.969> alright<00:01:00.199> got<00:01:01.199> my<00:01:01.350> four

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
it's going to wobble alright got my four

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.820 
it's going to wobble alright got my four
way<00:01:01.739> here<00:01:03.140> we're<00:01:04.140> looking<00:01:04.170> for<00:01:04.530> these<00:01:04.680> three

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
way here we're looking for these three

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.850 
way here we're looking for these three
quarter<00:01:05.159> or<00:01:05.280> nineteen<00:01:05.640> millimeter<00:01:05.790> side<00:01:06.860> the

quarter or nineteen millimeter side the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.370 
quarter or nineteen millimeter side the
star<00:01:08.130> method<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:09.299> pretty<00:01:09.600> much<00:01:09.750> exactly<00:01:10.170> what

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
star method is pretty much exactly what

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.660 
star method is pretty much exactly what
it<00:01:10.560> sounds<00:01:10.830> like<00:01:10.860> you're<00:01:11.250> going<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.460> draw<00:01:11.640> a

Bing Bing Bing Bing Bing just like that
what<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.430> does<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.670> seats<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.210> wheel<00:01:30.360> flat

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
what that does is seats the wheel flat

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.170 
what that does is seats the wheel flat
and<00:01:30.990> true<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.560> allows<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.549> self<00:01:32.820> centering

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
and true and allows the self centering

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
you can see what i like to use a

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.880 
you can see what i like to use a
four-way<00:01:49.720> because<00:01:49.900> you<00:01:49.960> get<00:01:50.050> that<00:01:50.200> nice<00:01:50.410> spin

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
four-way because you get that nice spin

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.110 
four-way because you get that nice spin
on<00:01:51.330> your<00:01:52.330> lug<00:01:52.510> nut<00:01:53.490> keep<00:01:54.490> you<00:01:54.640> from<00:01:54.760> renting
