00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.499 
excitement as we as we have actually
seen<00:01:38.439> a<00:01:38.679> season<00:01:39.219> pass<00:01:39.249> in<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:39.880> previous<00:01:40.270> Call

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
seen a season pass in the previous Call

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.749 
seen a season pass in the previous Call
of<00:01:40.539> Duty<00:01:40.869> titles<00:01:41.289> as<00:01:41.439> well<00:01:41.770> but<00:01:42.340> hopefully

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
of Duty titles as well but hopefully

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.120 
of Duty titles as well but hopefully
this<00:01:42.909> DLC<00:01:43.420> does<00:01:43.630> surprise<00:01:43.990> us<00:01:44.259> you<00:01:44.649> know<00:01:44.770> they

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
this DLC does surprise us you know they

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.709 
this DLC does surprise us you know they
haven't<00:01:45.369> actually<00:01:45.609> said<00:01:46.030> that<00:01:46.240> there's<00:01:46.630> going

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
haven't actually said that there's going

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.419 
haven't actually said that there's going
to<00:01:46.810> be<00:01:46.840> any<00:01:46.960> zombies<00:01:47.560> or<00:01:47.740> multiplayer<00:01:48.069> maps

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
to be any zombies or multiplayer maps

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.340 
to be any zombies or multiplayer maps
but<00:01:48.609> I<00:01:48.670> do<00:01:48.759> believe<00:01:49.060> there<00:01:49.749> will<00:01:49.899> be<00:01:50.049> around

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
but I do believe there will be around

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.770 
but I do believe there will be around
for<00:01:50.499> multiplayer<00:01:51.189> maps<00:01:51.520> and<00:01:51.789> one<00:01:52.090> zombies

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
for multiplayer maps and one zombies

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.529 
for multiplayer maps and one zombies
maps<00:01:53.049> as<00:01:53.229> well<00:01:53.530> for<00:01:54.130> every<00:01:54.340> single<00:01:54.670> DLC<00:01:55.179> pack

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
maps as well for every single DLC pack

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.449 
maps as well for every single DLC pack
hopefully<00:01:56.049> that<00:01:56.259> is<00:01:56.380> true<00:01:56.649> and<00:01:56.799> hopefully

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:57.459 
hopefully that is true and hopefully

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:58.980 
hopefully that is true and hopefully
that<00:01:57.700> does<00:01:57.909> get<00:01:58.090> confirmed<00:01:58.450> in<00:01:58.719> the<00:01:58.810> near

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
that does get confirmed in the near

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.779 
that does get confirmed in the near
future<00:01:59.049> but<00:01:59.499> like<00:01:59.649> you<00:01:59.799> did<00:01:59.920> say<00:02:00.159> I'll<00:02:00.429> keep
