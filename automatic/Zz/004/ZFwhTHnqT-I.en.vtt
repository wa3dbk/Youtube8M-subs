00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:06.289 

so<00:00:04.529> for<00:00:04.710> today's<00:00:04.950> video<00:00:05.220> I'm<00:00:05.580> gonna<00:00:05.819> be<00:00:05.940> doing

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
so for today's video I'm gonna be doing

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.070 
so for today's video I'm gonna be doing
a<00:00:06.390> test<00:00:07.010> comparing<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.280> tascam<00:00:08.820> yarrow<00:00:09.480> 5

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
a test comparing the tascam yarrow 5

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.530 
a test comparing the tascam yarrow 5
which<00:00:10.410> I<00:00:10.500> just<00:00:10.679> picked<00:00:10.889> up<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:11.340> my<00:00:12.030> current

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
which I just picked up and my current

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.160 
which I just picked up and my current
rode<00:00:12.840> videomic<00:00:13.410> pro<00:00:14.389> okay<00:00:15.389> so<00:00:15.450> my<00:00:15.780> idea<00:00:16.080> for

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
rode videomic pro okay so my idea for

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.990 
rode videomic pro okay so my idea for
this<00:00:16.379> video<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.250> we're<00:00:17.400> gonna<00:00:17.520> do<00:00:17.789> a

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
this video is that we're gonna do a

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.769 
this video is that we're gonna do a
blind<00:00:18.510> test<00:00:19.460> where<00:00:20.460> it's<00:00:20.970> all<00:00:21.270> about<00:00:21.330> the

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
blind test where it's all about the

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.849 
blind test where it's all about the
audio<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:23.300> you<00:00:24.300> have<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.779> pick<00:00:24.960> which<00:00:25.380> one<00:00:25.410> you

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
audio and you have to pick which one you

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.099 
audio and you have to pick which one you
like<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.099> best<00:00:26.359> I'm<00:00:27.359> in<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.570> number<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:27.990> the

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
like the best I'm in a number of the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.099 
like the best I'm in a number of the
samples<00:00:28.529> 1<00:00:28.920> through<00:00:29.160> 4<00:00:29.460> I've<00:00:30.240> got<00:00:30.539> 4<00:00:30.840> different

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
samples 1 through 4 I've got 4 different
