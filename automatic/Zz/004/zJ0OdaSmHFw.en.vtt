00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.180
 Sochiets 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.890
 Artem Eksuzyan finds on the seashore and 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.050
 the same change is certainly not about 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.400
 real animals in branches and roots 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.769
 trees which are folk craftsman 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.000
 turns the animals as usual garbage 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.170
 becomes a work of art 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.119
 I saw a video of Kazakov 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.039
 animals birds mythical creatures and even 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.529
 portraits of people over 1000 exhibits 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.810
 has a collection of arthur exuzyan a 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.670
 but he cannot show all his masterpieces 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.199
 they simply have nowhere to place here 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.660
 stored in boxes of familiar 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.920
 Sochi organized a small workshop 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.780
 right in my garage 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.250
 strange creatures attract here 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.360
 neighbour’s children and only going after him and 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.989
 I watch his fakes 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.289
 I didn’t like him very much 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.030
 her snake snake is and not even one 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.270
 specially for the new year master 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.789
 prepared a whole collection of symbols 2013 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.469
 Artyom recognized eksuzyan creating their 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.059
 work he did not seek to portray 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.590
 some kind of snake 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.809
 but some sculptures yet 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.299
 resemble real reptiles to 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.159
 For example, it looks like an anaconda to the same 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.290
 each one has a character 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.659
 friendly and there are aggressive predators 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.490
 the last author even portrayed at the moment 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.740
 sculptor eating his victims 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.930
 Engaged in karni plastic for 43 years 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.470
 this time learned to see the nature of a special 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.780
 with a glance 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.560
 images of future handicrafts are always in his mind 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.020
 and here and but if she is a little bit like 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.900
 koryazhka I sometimes pick it strictly 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.409
 you have to find us torso and 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.079
 after a year or two you give her drink 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.020
 I countersigned something similar happen and 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.250
 can be a piece of wood by itself 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.380
 here it seems 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.090
 usually material for their work master 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.840
 finds on the coast but there are 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.180
 exceptions 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.850
 the sculptor saw this snake sitting on 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.189
 the vine at his home and this 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.200
 snag the future artwork 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.689
 craftsman will work on it with 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.060
 using knives with a scalpel 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.950
 and soon a simple branch will turn into 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.479
 the new snake the sculptor dreams 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.939
 organize your creative workshop 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.069
 to get all the work out of the boxes and 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.640
 where can I teach others my 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.280
 craft 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.280
