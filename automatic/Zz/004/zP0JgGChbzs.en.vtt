00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.410
 welcome once again to my channel I am 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.750
 I ruminated and we are in modern warfare 3 mode 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.369
 infected fm eventual in hand and 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.930
 exactly if guys just days of the 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.340
 cable before starting the game and for 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.410
 that could the game continuing 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.640
 stretton we have from back well is 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.310
 talking a banana hacker we're going to 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.489
 mute this piece of name so 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.829
 original 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:35.570
 the guys tell you that this mode game 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.250
 it is very broken the connection is very broken 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.910
 people already have more hacks and this that 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.200
 that I may be my mother, my mother, and 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.090
 just put one let's follow it what 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.050
 more than they're going to kill him for sure I 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:50.090
 this uncle killed conscience and nothing 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.830
 we say that I have to upload a video that 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.350
 is that he is a fan and moments of 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.850
 but incredible 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.649
 other 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.559
 worth double perfect low we have already 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.089
 precipitation so let's see if it gives me the 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.040
 divine inspiration and I have something of 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.409
 time and I'll upload it and prepare it 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.759
 because it's going to be very epic, well, let's go 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.009
 to see this seeing and enemies we go and 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:13.280
 running to kill some they 're going to 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.020
 remove all the guys see that ValderÃ­a 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.670
 that site the terracita de sada and no no 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.560
 I want to put it there because once 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.509
 I went up and he says there's a streak but 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.330
 but by bike two multiple casualties 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.490
 followed there that was very epic but 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.229
 I'd rather not get on there today well we will 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.670
 see why it is that this is really 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.210
 being a little slow they do not carry three 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.310
 infected for a while now it's worth 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.890
 I do not know what we can do that we can 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.350
 do I do not know if I get 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.630
 Today I meddle in sack, I'm not going to 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.070
 kill this god take it from me uncle 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.530
 well let's try and a little bit to 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.640
 I pull in the middle because it 's very good 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.259
 you have to be very careful in infected 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.090
 many wonder how I play and such 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.149
 because I get so many more and those little things 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.530
 and then someday some guide not of how 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.820
 more or less the things that you have to 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.649
 take into account and others but good that 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.380
 it's not a silly thing, it's not just 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:08.420
 do not ever order them all at once 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.420
 it is something logical something that the world 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.120
 and you can move with caution and 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.620
 always the back covered not 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.630
 for the initiation posture we have another 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.310
 great quiz 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.310
 it's perfect already in a special way and 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.190
 ok here we have some 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.310
 it's worth another perfect one that does not 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.310
 I had seen 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:42.340
 very rich, very tasty little ones for the 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.340

 lad red sheriff in winter streak of 50 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.920
 infected I think that surpassed my record 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.290
 I think they were 49 I think once there I 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.760

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.840
 here there are no medallions that are the 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.070
 little pages of lower and others I think 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.470
 they know me in the game they are out there 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.880
 talking people because I hope that I have 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.980
 liked and that if you liked to hit 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.050
 that I just pulled 50 again when 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.420
 and I just think it's fine because said 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.980
 that the modified one is dead not by 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:22.840
 nothing we see in the next video a 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.840
 greeting and if you want goodbye 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.820
 in the son my mother piece of hickam what 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.350
 I'm going to put in slow motion because it 's 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.820
 incredible the only thing that is recorded but 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.800
 of cinema mode and there is a super movement 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.730
 strange there but one the speed with the 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.730
 distance of the turn
