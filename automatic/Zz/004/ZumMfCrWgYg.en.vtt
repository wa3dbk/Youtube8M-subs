all you really need are a couple of
trees<00:00:25.540> that<00:00:25.900> are<00:00:26.460> appropriately<00:00:27.780> placed<00:00:29.220> with

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
trees that are appropriately placed with

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.160 
trees that are appropriately placed with
the<00:00:31.290> sort<00:00:32.290> of<00:00:32.500> flat<00:00:32.739> spot<00:00:33.100> in<00:00:33.250> between<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.989> as

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
the sort of flat spot in between and as

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.260 
the sort of flat spot in between and as
Excel<00:00:35.680> you<00:00:35.920> really<00:00:36.190> have<00:00:36.340> to<00:00:36.489> do<00:00:36.640> just<00:00:36.969> below

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
Excel you really have to do just below

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.189 
Excel you really have to do just below
the<00:00:37.480> rope<00:00:37.750> up<00:00:38.020> over<00:00:38.710> a<00:00:39.100> limb<00:00:39.940> and<00:00:40.269> you<00:00:40.329> want<00:00:41.079> to

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
the rope up over a limb and you want to

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.329 
the rope up over a limb and you want to
try<00:00:41.710> to<00:00:41.769> get<00:00:42.039> it<00:00:42.159> up<00:00:42.280> pretty<00:00:42.760> high<00:00:43.620> 15<00:00:44.620> feet<00:00:45.100> or

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.339 
try to get it up pretty high 15 feet or

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:48.989 
try to get it up pretty high 15 feet or
so<00:00:45.550> is<00:00:45.850> probably<00:00:46.600> your<00:00:47.289> best<00:00:47.350> bet<00:00:47.699> and<00:00:48.699> you<00:00:48.850> can

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:48.999 
so is probably your best bet and you can

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:51.149 
so is probably your best bet and you can
tie<00:00:49.179> the<00:00:49.239> rope<00:00:49.539> off<00:00:49.749> either<00:00:49.989> to<00:00:50.289> itself<00:00:50.800> or

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.159 
tie the rope off either to itself or

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:52.529 
tie the rope off either to itself or
maybe<00:00:51.489> if<00:00:51.670> you've<00:00:51.819> got<00:00:52.059> little<00:00:52.300> limbs

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 
maybe if you've got little limbs

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.689 
maybe if you've got little limbs
sticking<00:00:52.659> out<00:00:53.050> you<00:00:53.199> can<00:00:53.379> use<00:00:53.530> it<00:00:53.800> even<00:00:54.249> tied<00:00:54.460> to

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
sticking out you can use it even tied to

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.149 
sticking out you can use it even tied to
another<00:00:54.940> tree<00:00:55.359> you<00:00:56.289> want<00:00:56.469> to<00:00:56.589> check<00:00:56.769> it<00:00:56.949> make

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.159 
another tree you want to check it make

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:59.430 
another tree you want to check it make
sure<00:00:57.190> it's<00:00:57.659> going<00:00:58.659> to<00:00:58.719> be<00:00:58.839> strong<00:00:59.139> enough<00:00:59.170> for

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
sure it's going to be strong enough for

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.689 
sure it's going to be strong enough for
you<00:00:59.829> and<00:01:00.129> then<00:01:00.969> throw<00:01:01.179> it<00:01:01.389> over<00:01:01.629> the<00:01:01.780> other

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
you and then throw it over the other

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.450 
you and then throw it over the other
tree<00:01:03.699> them<00:01:03.969> that<00:01:04.239> you've<00:01:04.420> selected<00:01:05.460> I'll

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
tree them that you've selected I'll

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.110 
tree them that you've selected I'll
leave<00:01:06.700> it<00:01:06.820> loose<00:01:08.370> squawk<00:01:09.370> the<00:01:09.520> tar<00:01:09.729> pool<00:01:09.940> with

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
leave it loose squawk the tar pool with

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.600 
leave it loose squawk the tar pool with
the<00:01:10.210> rope<00:01:11.790> now<00:01:12.790> try<00:01:13.060> to<00:01:13.120> roughly<00:01:13.720> Center<00:01:14.230> it<00:01:14.610> of

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
the rope now try to roughly Center it of

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.490 
the rope now try to roughly Center it of
course<00:01:15.790> you<00:01:15.970> can<00:01:16.090> locate<00:01:16.270> your<00:01:16.660> Center<00:01:17.050> eyelid

and put it at each corner and at least
out<00:02:44.630> in<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.840> middle<00:02:45.170> and<00:02:45.320> you<00:02:45.380> might<00:02:45.560> even

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
out in the middle and you might even

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.110 
out in the middle and you might even
want<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.100> do<00:02:46.220> more<00:02:46.460> if<00:02:46.580> you're<00:02:46.760> going<00:02:46.880> to<00:02:46.970> get<00:02:47.060> a

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
want to do more if you're going to get a

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.300 
want to do more if you're going to get a
lot<00:02:47.300> of<00:02:47.390> wind<00:02:47.650> as<00:02:48.650> you<00:02:48.710> can<00:02:48.920> see<00:02:49.070> what<00:02:49.220> I'm

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
lot of wind as you can see what I'm

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.010 
lot of wind as you can see what I'm
doing<00:02:49.340> here<00:02:49.760> is<00:02:49.820> I'm<00:02:49.970> not<00:02:50.150> actually<00:02:50.390> using<00:02:50.810> the

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
doing here is I'm not actually using the

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.130 
doing here is I'm not actually using the
eyelet<00:02:51.440> of<00:02:51.770> course<00:02:52.070> you<00:02:52.160> can<00:02:52.400> use<00:02:52.640> it<00:02:52.850> but<00:02:53.420> in

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
eyelet of course you can use it but in

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.900 
eyelet of course you can use it but in
this<00:02:54.350> case<00:02:54.680> I'm<00:02:54.920> just<00:02:55.130> kind<00:02:55.340> of<00:02:55.400> wrapping<00:02:55.850> it

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
this case I'm just kind of wrapping it

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.790 
this case I'm just kind of wrapping it
around<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.630> then<00:02:56.750> down<00:02:56.990> and<00:02:57.230> off<00:02:57.380> -<00:02:57.680> it's

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
around and then down and off - it's

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.060 
around and then down and off - it's
tough<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:58.810> what<00:02:59.810> that<00:03:00.020> does<00:03:00.260> is<00:03:00.530> it<00:03:00.680> keeps<00:03:00.920> you

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
tough and what that does is it keeps you

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.180 
tough and what that does is it keeps you
from<00:03:01.190> pulling

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
from pulling

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.670 
from pulling
thus<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.400> eyelid<00:03:04.790> is<00:03:05.000> available<00:03:05.660> for<00:03:06.020> a<00:03:06.410> ball

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
thus the eyelid is available for a ball

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.730 
thus the eyelid is available for a ball
now<00:03:09.680> in<00:03:09.800> this<00:03:09.890> case<00:03:10.130> I'm<00:03:10.340> going<00:03:10.520> to<00:03:10.580> stake<00:03:10.940> this

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
now in this case I'm going to stake this

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.460 
now in this case I'm going to stake this
corner<00:03:12.740> down<00:03:13.010> I<00:03:13.360> could<00:03:14.360> also<00:03:14.540> up<00:03:14.900> taking<00:03:15.230> it<00:03:15.320> up

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
corner down I could also up taking it up

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.560 
corner down I could also up taking it up
there<00:03:15.710> in<00:03:15.860> that<00:03:15.890> tree<00:03:16.010> or<00:03:16.640> bush<00:03:17.030> or<00:03:17.240> whatever
