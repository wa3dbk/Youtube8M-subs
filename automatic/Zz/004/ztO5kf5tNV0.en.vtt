00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.730
 so hello everyone to a new tutorial 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.730
 and this time it's all about hopping 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.260
 So funnel blogs to build and this 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.910
 so have some benefits and that will 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.560
 I just show a bit now 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.410
 I am beginning to the simplest or this 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.300
 to build a variant of it namely a 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.860
 victim into another victim 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.930
 leads and the other victim leads 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.280
 turn the hopper into it that is 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.320
 item or item what to do now 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.809
 For example, Rhein is thrown 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.790
 that is now switch back and forth throughout 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.470
 so and not only have the boxes 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.750
 property that you are sending out a signal 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.129
 If you have an item in them you are 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.879
 knows that hopper for example border 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.309
 and can control 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.940
 So now I would do something like that 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.879
 torches connect 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.440
 then the thing would be stopped so 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.659
 paused so you can theoretically then 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.890
 a klockner still stop and 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:56.979
 however, you can then parallel 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.269
 again, here through moment 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:01.640
 government district that the way then can 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.320
 one also derives signals from the owner 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.120
 that means pulsating signals like you 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.620
 So we need one for that 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.090
 redstone corporate as well as in the 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.310
 You can put it in boxes when an item 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.720
 it is in this box then there is 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.770
 accordingly a signal can be 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.180
 that makes even with the Hofer continues to 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.979
 before in Europe is to go as far yes 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.329
 also a signal from so I just now 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.280
 times now here 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:21.259
 redstone computer behind it one sees 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.729
 now he is pulsing and third 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.590
 could reduce it now in the repeater 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.439
 and put on a shoe and we 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.539
 have created a glock here in front 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.329
 relatively simple even that actually too 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.350
 it works is reasonably fast 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.390
 blog shot on it 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.549
 the value attracted product placements 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.200
 pulled up then immediately good that 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.630
 So we are the simplest version 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.070
 a glock ok you can now you are 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.170
 the team continues to put forward same 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.759
 I had to show it to those who showed it 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:52.070
 again, but that does not matter 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.840
 the simplest variant but not wet short 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.210
 get started longer or do you have that 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.259
 best at the same time let it show so then 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.390
 I again briefly what else besides 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.770
 example or in the context so 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.740
 First of all, here it is 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.869
 as soon as later signal 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.100
 but you want to reduce it 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.470
 is that just a signal or a signal 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.240
 signal strength a blog length from the 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.069
 corporate come out so now the 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.870
 advantage is there the whole two-way 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.760
 if there is a third now is not there 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.010
 item in that means in the clear text I can 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.730
 here still as connect and then can 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.920
 I 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.170
 if it is no I may but things 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.480
 is the top course , of course 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.340
 blog cult it reminds me that I have one 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.720
 reciprocal knocking should change that 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.370
 If there is then he is not if 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.690
 so it's not so about each 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.220
 conversely I had already done that 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.330
 and great for a mutual bell 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.330
 was much more complicated 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.470
 that 's how it's easier 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.720
 thing is I still find good 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.349
 the following with these i tell andel's 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.660
 this hopper are judges yes knows 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.829
 I do not know any of these clogs here 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.750
 so generally know a bit 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.890
 he can be 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.670
 By the way, automatically times at 0 me 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.790
 finds horny use here that the 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.799
 Wendler the thing here throws this 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.940
 bell arises so it happens sometimes 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.680
 So from my experiences for example 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.359
 not in the circuit words of mine 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.459
 For example, I use tutorial desert 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:09.109
 Incidentally, now not because I as 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.760
 now here on the snapshot player and 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:12.049
 if I then downgrading on the 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.190
 world to play it all away again 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.720
 it would be nonsense i would you 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.840
 never say we take and want to 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.340
 If I'm in a world then I copy 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.459
 Again, I see a new start sometimes 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.810
 that this one i'll tell it clogs this one 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.160
 art are sometimes broken that is 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.480
 sometimes they look like that when I am 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.250
 Log in again 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.590
 that happens on the right and art 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.940
 channel client field or so that means that 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.290
 it was stored correctly though 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.609
 sometimes that does not happen like that 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.109
 really one hundred percent reliable 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.579
 if in an app builds in the onward 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.500
 send for example in any way 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.790
 and even as a Glock to 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.049
 quotation marks broken 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.459
 no more than willing that means to me 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.540
 is that happened a few times already knows 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.970
 not whether it always works on new versions 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.590
 this is how it can be or can be me 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.019
 which claim but if that is so 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.609
 i find this system more trusting 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.919
 because if you log in then there is 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.269
 where logically probably back again the 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:58.370
 lay partly to pass on 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.510
 a thing or I do not know can too 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.790
 I am also in the bug 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.930
 guess you can reliably's 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.200
 make faster the scores two 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.389
 Things purely do indeed way of life 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.400
 nonsense biggest concern there's it 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:12.139
 I did not confuse it with that 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.639
 four at two years is not 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.620
 Because that is then in total 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:17.150
 closed with 1 packed in four 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.599
 does that but now points to degree 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.859
 behind 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:22.099
 I did the same and with you 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.720
 four people mostly could do the following 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:25.370
 see the whole is also mutually 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.260
 but this time in quadruple 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.909
 mutually intact that would have you 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.080
 tried that in the normal circuit 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:31.490
 get that done a bit 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.139
 harder a bit harder 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.360
 if he changed many times 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.129
 Carmen wanted that or I did 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.659
 me if I spontaneously build now 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:40.520
 would not simply have videos with knives 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:41.930
 should make it so the stools go 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.879
 In any case, that means four 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.289
 Change the body or publisher that 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:48.650
 Of course now through love can also 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:50.029
 if you should tell me now 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.379
 even more end of the side by side 

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:53.090
 then you can do something like that 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:55.099
 as I had that with the lighthouse 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.199
 is called klaus and his series in front of it 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:58.759
 knowledge with stones the industries toilets 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.770
 and cover up and in a la ola wave 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:02.749
 so to speak, everything is going through 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.580
 Accordingly, it would also look like 

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:06.259
 if you have a rotating light on the 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.599
 tip of the glow would be located 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:09.349
 I'm also extremely literate 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:10.969
 I have it a bit 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:12.349
 complicated solved not quite like that 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:14.779
 I have to do it manually every time 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:17.419
 click on it with exactly as close we will 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:19.219
 that would be too much for the back and the stools 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.930
 much of everything that is passed through 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:22.460
 and every time in the end where the team 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.409
 in it the pistes are activated 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.819
 press block up and then 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:27.289
 we already have this rotating light 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:29.120
 maybe you have to stop several more 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.080
 However, the fractions are pure 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.599
 run through 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.520
 so that the whole only for a short time 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:36.259
 but below is mostly upwards 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.699
 is stretched so much is set to come 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:39.830
 too complicated maybe too 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:41.300
 would like to explain the playlist 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.849
 No early as the lighthouse with 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.319
 watch tealight tutorial there you can 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:46.819
 among other things may also 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:48.199
 Walls or I would like to use 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:50.360
 Do not show it again anyway 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:52.039
 that at least the advantage of the 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.569
 There were also two things in this type of klop 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:55.399
 then mere throw accordingly, the 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:57.020
 we do not know the whole thing faster 

00:05:55.399 --> 00:06:00.649
 more completely reciprocal but dual 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:03.860
 change time this and this and this one 

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:06.289
 us this so a bit quite 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.569
 Complex looks alternate take off 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:12.529
 away but twice as fast as 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:14.029
 if I'm only 1/100 off and away 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:15.949
 The whole thing now almost twice as 

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:17.089
 quickly away away so away 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:18.229
 a bit complicated to explain though 

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:20.839
 I hope that is understandable 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:22.789
 now again this one there 

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:25.009
 and this function at the same time exactly 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:27.080
 Looks and this and Lisa goes too 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:28.520
 at the same time faster now 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.469
 faster now a bit 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.990
 funny but well that's nice 

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:34.520
 okay with the death that would be in this case 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.469
 i have also been to this knox 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.029
 important to explain for a maybe 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:39.740
 for a thing now there back then 

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:41.240
 Accordingly , I am for 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.649
 watch if the whole country was the
