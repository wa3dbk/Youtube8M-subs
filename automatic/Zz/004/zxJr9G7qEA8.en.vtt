00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.170
 and more difficulty is to learn 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.600
 thought and pini class in criticizing of possible people seeing all things 

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:09.280
 I got to thinking about her 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.960
 tourists is one of the things that it expresses very much. 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:14.289
 selected 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:16.880
 because of the supposed daughter they present 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.820
 we can 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.929
 and in 3d 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:22.359
 all the subjects in which they presented for a clinical side 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:23.400
 I always got 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.640
 in general the patient as a whole not only to the command in his as the pathology 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.979
 and I got it 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:32.500
 helping in many ways 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.109
 I think when we chose the profession and have no contact with it 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:39.109
 An account of the times ends up being a 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.760
 the people 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.760
 then things will work out if you're looking for it too 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.130
 n if you really have to see 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.130
 but everything ends up being a surprise the colleges collected taipei 101 70 years 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.550
 Paul, we are surprised, we end up liking, we feel more and more. 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.420
 in fact my first choice is not nursing not 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.190
 a technology-trained nation in a web designer and I wanted to make a 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.160
 second college atp tour right 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.120
 did not identify with correction and was to know the clinic deferred 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.950
 I talked to several students and teachers when I did a 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.700
 course of legal medicine offered by the university itself 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.150
 I discovered that there was no higher award 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.840
 biological nanda even 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.290
 so I ate attend classes I fell in love with the board almost half of 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.490
 teachers of restitution greater physical space that he offered 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.100
 future monitoring opportunities edit in touch with the profession one year ago 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.100
 at the beginning of the course so I think it's a training 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.670
 also differentiate between not buying 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.950
 I think the structure of English is a differential so why do we have 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.670
 one are resources that we listen to here that help me a lot to the people at the time 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.850
 it was a non-protest 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:58.560
 professional 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.390
 I think it is an area that is lacking in 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.870
 professionals 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.440
 qualified not to inject size 500 we see things if we talk in the 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.609
 pen to the end because I want 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:14.909
 fix things that the half douglas did not 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.329
 nor so suitable for what I learn in 1 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.459
 and college is also a ripoff 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.870
 told us in this same area of ​​nursing to understand our importance 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.750
 in qimonda in the profession until together with its professionals chose to do 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:35.169
 then make yourself a member 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:36.659
 within the family 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.709
 who is already part of this 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.590
 so I think it's very beautiful or because I have this good as I speak 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.519
 the area by left-hand routing to a certain routine can be sure that it was 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.029
 that's exactly what I wanted 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:55.660
 I thought it was your student that is an opportunity like that. 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.260
 he is sure that that 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.150
 he does not want 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.600
 I returned in the square regretting the name of the Corsican that is a rather annoying thing I 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.680
 I think it's cool what the university offers. 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.900
 is the peak in the nursing course the student is already participating in the first 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.119
 year that 

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:15.329
 a limited emc 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:20.540
 both the other band is in contact with people who is the fact the organ 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.699
 have the first city to offer 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:23.999
 the internship 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:26.210
 another student chose because 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.119
 she informs the site 

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:30.569
 who is off the agenda the care 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.569
 so my goal since I started the course 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:40.039
 he works the patient in a very general way thinking about the physical social part 

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:41.389
 physiological 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.949
 so that's what I found 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:45.029
 and this 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:48.029
 foreign bodies acquisition as disappointments 

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:51.859
 so for example we have listing of psychiatry 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:57.869
 so we're going to do places in environments where patients are told 

00:03:57.869 --> 00:04:01.979
 people need this kind of care because we have a scenario where 

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:05.859
 nurses who are directed there is a wound treatment then it is a 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:09.739
 trinca reference in the treatment of wounds and also we have the 5th dp 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.339
 retention and of birds 

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:16.639
 the difficulty that this interaction often has with the patient we have 

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:20.539
 a serious accident 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:25.039
 so often socially we got used to it 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:26.710
 health professionals 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.870
 the only common patient simply a patient 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.189
 so here we find a very different reality 

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:36.189
 wants to start seeing the whole person 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.139
 if you are the sixth 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:30.270
 scliar 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.059
 technical tite 

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:36.059
 known or deceased 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.000
 the campaign next 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.599
 free 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:42.960
 jobim 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.939
 the red shirts 

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:46.170
 in 2006 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:47.900
 between the 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.900
 yes like this 

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:54.759
 the English we are insisting to be kept 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:58.139
 questioned whether she would 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:01.139
 This patient is not for us. 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.889
 with the decision to judge the Los Angeles Artists 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:07.529
 and here we are 

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:08.909
 the cases of dengue 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:11.909
 bright mothers 

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:16.419
 lack of information he has 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:19.279
 who was on the committee sep 

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:22.759
 is the skin of course we know that the image 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:26.419
 recent scientific 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.840
 bring to these things 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.610
 the city does science he saw 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.169
 I felt I had been arrested 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:37.060
 the inter will thus understand 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.999
 he 

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:41.719
 thanks to the population already knows how to differentiate 

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:45.679
 the part of the military police you have 

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:48.939
 unfortunately caused such patience
