00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.919
 she was from the park the tension 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:10.370
 oh God I'm throwing up is no longer going to 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.370
 Leave 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.240
 Hello everyone , we are in this noble 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.550
 but on free on new playstation yes 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.200
 called sting are the only animal this 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.700
 error but you should be a stealth 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.730
 and we will discover it together 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.980
 completely that I've never played 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.629
 but I knew from friends that it seems 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.239
 fun I want to take it with you 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:41.280
 for the very first time there is also the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.890
 my cat that will keep me company with these 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.110
 parts and we immediately begin to play the 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.449
 game all the more is called sticks not 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.059
 spins and anyway let's find out 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.670
 going crazy I was trapped e 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.110
 so now I simply have to 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:03.119
 run away squatting or rose ok then 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:05.309
 we skip huge jumps we can run 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:06.510
 even in a way you can't run but 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.270
 maybe a new stent doesn't make sense 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.460
 run around the park and the tension 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.470
 for it will not be wolk on then i 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.750
 movies of salt is burning hot if you like 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.900
 make history for you who did it yourself but 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.979
 not because it makes it hard to show you 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.020
 because I also want to bring jobs 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.689
 and when it seems to me that suitable day 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.890
 to show with history then maybe 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.359
 made the first episode when it starts 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.070
 the real story to do a little bit 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:34.920
 always see the reunion at auction 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.549
 matched more or less refuses I have 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.260
 put normal so you can do more or less 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:46.840
 so a weapon 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:46.840
 maybe I understand 123 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.860
 but we're ok guys walking 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.590
 crouch does not make you discover but 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.259
 be careful where you walk because if per 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.619
 example you hit something that makes noise 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.420
 really the guard will wake up and us 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.530
 we walk walked we walk is 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.979
 arrived and I put more shadows 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.620
 reviewed hidden and must be see a 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.010
 you may not even plan or hide 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.630
 push the tracks because it's dark ok 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.069
 so I turn off this crossbar ok 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:27.549
 right now I'm hidden and that 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.549
 they don't see me, fabio serves this ok 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.160
 but they don't see me ok 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.970
 ok done something a bit risky that 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.930
 you did n't say they wouldn't see me cement 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.400
 this goal the table so ok 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.180
 waiting for the musicians obviously must 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:53.730
 even knowing where he looks ok 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:56.010
 ehhh ok 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.439
 my dagger disappears 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.959
 maybe a dagger of course I can 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:06.090
 hit something maybe more but it 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:09.150
 I observe nice cool card but also of time 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.519
 to crack it ok no chance 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.760
 instead they give me to drink a vial of 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:20.090
 life to what in life if but not this 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.090
 give me how the hell they die 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:28.440
 ok where the hell I have to go 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.780
 maybe right there 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:35.540
 I know why but I saw the last one at 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.540
 dead colonel grows a carpet 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:45.370
 capri sa or god i can also take the 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.630
 dead body 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:53.290
 it's true hi guys it's cool completely 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.290
 then 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:07.860
 guys the fight nothing 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:11.440
 let's say how to say about skill 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.770
 because for example it is not that I can 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.510
 hurt me first and he hurts me 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:20.130
 I can simply speak with del 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:22.180
 timing and then killing it is the only way 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.040
 explaining all the sauces I find because 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.810
 sincerely inspires me trust is not 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:32.580
 what or pure gods no this game guys 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:39.670
 and spectacular how much power has remained 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:40.980
 Oh God, if you put them right it's going to 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.600
 Leave 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.270
 ok 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.490
 they are still more enlightened people 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.800
 more enlightened professor we dominate 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:57.400
 be careful because it turns its back 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:02.100
 ok its complex not present covered or 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:06.730
 say I'm starting no no no no no 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:08.620
 maybe they don't see me oh, they don't see 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:15.520
 really the illuminating passage 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:20.260
 obviously I'm dead 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:24.340
 and how the hell are you doing or less are they? 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:27.960
 the dead have discovered my life 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.960
 on the other hand it's over 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:38.310
 ok ok 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:43.310
 no ok not even killing it works now 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.310
 I'm hiding room 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:54.330
 oh God, but it was like that, but I see it too 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:06:01.100
 so you send it you don't see me you are 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:06.110
 saying the wine he maybe sees me kill him 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:06.110
 can't not see me from the boys 16 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:16.210
 not happy affect oh well I understand the 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.210
 mechanics now at least at least 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:24.260
 no no no no no no no you can't escape 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.340
 in this game 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:33.170
 ok the video is coming to an end 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:35.480
 let the 650 I like indeed 654 mi 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:38.270
 like for an episode of sticks 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.740
 honestly a little intrigued me and 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.500
 if you want to know if I can get over it 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.870
 part of it left at 653 mi 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.760
 I also like about Enia 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.070
 some of you tell me switch put the 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.230
 song in this game peel it of 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:53.210
 more on which figure of the more shrill edges 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.280
 according to me the boys the beauty of 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.750
 detecting a video game is also 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:59.240
 identify oneself, for example, if I did the 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.940
 asshole url assists relax would not be 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.880
 a stealth game that is, I do not identify myself 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:07.670
 her in a stealth character or in awe 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.560
 when I go to kick the ball using 

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.000
 I also holding your breath because you 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.730
 try to help my player to do 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.850
 goal then guys in my opinion every game 

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:18.680
 to his kind of way to celebrate 

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:21.340
 things for example here I have to stay in 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.690
 silence speak when needed 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.730
 holding the breath and passing by his 

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.530
 enemies for example scared other things than 

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.160
 video with music other things and so on 

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.260
 etc 

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.360
 so guys I think this is it 

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.230
 adequate that is my point of view on 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.970
 this thing 

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.740
 write me your point of view on 

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:38.660
 made of the various shrill and these things 

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.880
 and I recommend there is also a like 

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.710
 to comment on gambling and get me 

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.330
 to know if you liked it as usual 

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.910
 pass on my social media more like only 

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.890
 description or here at the bottom of the video
