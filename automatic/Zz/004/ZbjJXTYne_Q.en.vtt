this<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.110> hollow<00:00:10.410> metal<00:00:10.830> can<00:00:11.599> with<00:00:12.599> rubber

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
this is a hollow metal can with rubber

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.070 
this is a hollow metal can with rubber
stopper<00:00:13.610> and<00:00:14.610> we<00:00:14.759> filled<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.150> can<00:00:15.540> with<00:00:15.839> dry

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
stopper and we filled that can with dry

stopper and we filled that can with dry
ice<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.830> solid<00:00:17.160> carbon<00:00:17.609> dioxide<00:00:19.789> now<00:00:20.789> you

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
ice that is solid carbon dioxide now you

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.759 
ice that is solid carbon dioxide now you
know<00:00:21.029> solid<00:00:21.300> carbon<00:00:21.689> dioxide<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.260> very<00:00:22.439> cold

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
know solid carbon dioxide is very cold

this<00:00:23.430> white<00:00:23.699> stuff<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.210> just<00:00:24.420> frost<00:00:24.750> that's

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
this white stuff is just frost that's

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.000 
this white stuff is just frost that's
gathered<00:00:25.590> on<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.830> outside<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.580> can<00:00:28.010> now

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
gathered on the outside of the can now

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.120

the carbon dioxide evaporates and turns

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.630 
the carbon dioxide evaporates and turns
into<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.090> gas<00:00:36.559> the<00:00:37.559> gas<00:00:37.770> takes<00:00:38.100> up<00:00:38.280> more<00:00:38.460> room

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
into a gas the gas takes up more room

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.360 
into a gas the gas takes up more room
than<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.940> solid<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.140> has<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.440> go<00:00:40.590> somewhere

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370

can't come out the top so it comes out a
little<00:00:44.879> hole<00:00:45.120> here<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.570> bottom<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
can see that there's gas coming out and

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.939 
can see that there's gas coming out and
blowing<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.180> flame<00:00:58.789> now<00:00:59.789> if<00:01:00.030> we<00:01:00.180> put<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.570> disc

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
I'm sure you can't see it from out there

I'm sure you can't see it from out there
I<00:01:33.780> can<00:01:34.140> scarcely<00:01:34.530> see<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:35.040> thick<00:01:35.310> see<00:01:35.970> a

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
I can scarcely see that thick see a

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.580 
I can scarcely see that thick see a

myself<00:01:38.840> but<00:01:39.840> if<00:01:39.930> you'll<00:01:40.079> come<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.439> look<00:01:40.560> over

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
myself but if you'll come and look over

myself but if you'll come and look over
my<00:01:41.009> shoulder<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.490> think<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.000> can<00:01:42.210> show<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.479> that

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
the disc this piece of tinfoil I took

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.700 
the disc this piece of tinfoil I took
off<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:50.970> chewing<00:01:51.270> gum<00:01:51.390> wrapper<00:01:51.750> now<00:01:52.500> will

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
off the chewing gum wrapper now will

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.370 
off the chewing gum wrapper now will
slip<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.009> tinfoil<00:01:53.640> between<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.750> disc<00:01:55.049> and

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
slip the tinfoil between the disc and

the plate glass top of the table showing

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.240 
the plate glass top of the table showing
that<00:01:59.280> there<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.640> indeed<00:01:59.850> a<00:02:00.299> space<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.439> thin<00:02:02.009> film

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
that there is indeed a space a thin film

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.350 
that there is indeed a space a thin film
of<00:02:02.490> gas<00:02:02.759> between<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.990> disc<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:06.090> glass

purpose of this is simply to reduce the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.910 
purpose of this is simply to reduce the
friction<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.570> point<00:02:12.900> where<00:02:13.380> we<00:02:13.500> won't<00:02:13.650> have

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
friction to a point where we won't have

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.280 
friction to a point where we won't have
to<00:02:14.160> worry<00:02:14.460> about<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:14.940> or<00:02:15.090> measure<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.570> in<00:02:15.990> our

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
to worry about it or measure it in our

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.800 
to worry about it or measure it in our
experiments<00:02:16.920> today<00:02:17.190> it's<00:02:18.150> fun<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.480> play<00:02:18.630> with

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
experiments today it's fun to play with

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.920 
experiments today it's fun to play with
this<00:02:18.930> thing<00:02:18.990> let<00:02:19.830> me<00:02:19.920> show<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:20.570> I'll<00:02:21.570> give<00:02:21.840> it

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
this thing let me show you I'll give it

a little push just a little one and
there<00:02:27.840> it<00:02:27.930> goes

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
there it goes

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.350 
there it goes
moving<00:02:29.250> sedately<00:02:29.930> no<00:02:30.930> sign<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.410> slowing<00:02:31.530> up

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
moving sedately no sign of slowing up

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.490 
moving sedately no sign of slowing up
come<00:02:33.360> on<00:02:33.480> back<00:02:35.960> same<00:02:36.960> thing<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.380> other

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
come on back same thing the other

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.420 
come on back same thing the other
direction<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:40.170> takes<00:02:40.200> only<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.860> very<00:02:41.130> tiny

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
direction it takes only a very tiny

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.660 
direction it takes only a very tiny
force<00:02:41.850> to<00:02:42.180> start<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.690> in<00:02:42.870> motion<00:02:43.310> let<00:02:44.310> me<00:02:44.460> show

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
force to start it in motion let me show

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.850 
force to start it in motion let me show
you<00:02:44.730> that
