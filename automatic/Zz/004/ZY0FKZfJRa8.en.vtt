freeze them and waste all that resources

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.370 
freeze them and waste all that resources
because<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.340> cost<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.880> sugar<00:01:42.240> it's<00:01:42.810> cost<00:01:43.140> to

because it's cost you sugar it's cost to
you<00:01:43.470> honey

to<00:01:44.460> draw<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.880> wax<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:46.079> what<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.320> do<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.829> let<00:01:47.130> the

to draw that wax so what I do is let the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.399 
to draw that wax so what I do is let the
drones<00:01:47.790> hatch<00:01:48.119> out<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.990> use<00:01:49.200> them<00:01:49.350> for

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
drones hatch out and I use them for

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.139 
drones hatch out and I use them for
mating<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:50.450> don't<00:01:51.450> have<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:52.200> drone<00:01:53.149> saturating

got an eighth frame high you can have
six<00:04:59.410> frames<00:04:59.710> in<00:04:59.950> there<00:05:00.130> they<00:05:00.700> don't<00:05:00.850> have<00:05:00.970> a

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
six frames in there they don't have a

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.750 
six frames in there they don't have a
minimum<00:05:01.510> of<00:05:01.570> two<00:05:01.900> to<00:05:01.930> ten<00:05:02.320> or<00:05:02.500> twenty<00:05:02.830> cells<00:05:03.460> on

the way up it would but if you want to
really<00:05:57.160> do<00:05:57.340> it<00:05:57.430> efficiently<00:05:57.850> you<00:05:58.150> use<00:05:58.330> caustic

really do it efficiently you use caustic
soda<00:05:59.080> that's<00:05:59.380> when<00:05:59.620> clean<00:06:00.010> frames<00:06:00.310> years<00:06:00.640> ago

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
soda that's when clean frames years ago

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.510 
soda that's when clean frames years ago
but<00:06:02.080> you<00:06:02.320> gotta<00:06:02.500> wear<00:06:02.620> rubber<00:06:02.860> gloves<00:06:03.010> that

stuff that's basically you is what it is
so<00:06:05.950> I<00:06:05.980> call<00:06:06.310> the<00:06:06.460> manufacturer<00:06:06.970> and<00:06:07.390> that's

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:07.540 
so I call the manufacturer and that's

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.410 
so I call the manufacturer and that's
about<00:06:08.020> the<00:06:08.350> part<00:06:08.590> you<00:06:08.680> want<00:06:08.890> to<00:06:08.920> clean<00:06:09.130> it<00:06:09.250> up

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:09.420 
about the part you want to clean it up

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.780 
about the part you want to clean it up
better<00:06:10.420> be<00:06:10.660> the<00:06:10.720> dirt<00:06:11.050> and<00:06:11.740> ground<00:06:12.220> it<00:06:12.580> takes

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790 
better be the dirt and ground it takes

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.850 
better be the dirt and ground it takes
the<00:06:12.940> energy<00:06:13.270> for<00:06:13.420> them<00:06:13.540> bees<00:06:13.720> to<00:06:13.900> do<00:06:14.050> that<00:06:14.290> you

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
the energy for them bees to do that you

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.320 
the energy for them bees to do that you
know<00:06:15.010> that's<00:06:15.370> why<00:06:15.550> I'm<00:06:15.610> here<00:06:15.670> to<00:06:16.000> find<00:06:16.150> that

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
know that's why I'm here to find that

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.070 
know that's why I'm here to find that
run<00:06:16.570> I<00:06:17.400> discourage<00:06:18.400> plastic<00:06:19.150> because<00:06:19.810> of<00:06:20.020> the

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
run I discourage plastic because of the

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.960 
run I discourage plastic because of the
Queen<00:06:20.350> cells<00:06:20.710> and<00:06:20.980> you<00:06:21.340> got<00:06:21.460> to<00:06:21.580> stop<00:06:21.790> and

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:21.970 
Queen cells and you got to stop and

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.580 
Queen cells and you got to stop and
think<00:06:22.030> when<00:06:22.360> you<00:06:22.450> put<00:06:22.660> a<00:06:22.690> plastic<00:06:23.140> frame<00:06:23.320> in

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
think when you put a plastic frame in

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.400 
think when you put a plastic frame in
there<00:06:23.740> when<00:06:24.640> it<00:06:24.729> gets<00:06:24.910> above<00:06:25.060> 75<00:06:25.750> degrees<00:06:26.080> that

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:26.410 
there when it gets above 75 degrees that

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.280 
there when it gets above 75 degrees that
plastic<00:06:26.919> frames<00:06:27.220> going<00:06:27.460> to<00:06:27.550> outguess<00:06:27.970> and<00:06:28.870> I

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:29.290 
plastic frames going to outguess and I

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.920 
plastic frames going to outguess and I
don't<00:06:29.350> know<00:06:29.710> if<00:06:29.830> I<00:06:29.919> have<00:06:30.160> it<00:06:30.310> on<00:06:30.400> this<00:06:30.930> series

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
don't know if I have it on this series

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.160 
don't know if I have it on this series
here<00:06:32.350> but<00:06:32.530> I've<00:06:32.680> got<00:06:32.710> some
