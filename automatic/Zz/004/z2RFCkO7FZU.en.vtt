00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.949 
this one's paintjob actually looks
really<00:04:11.170> good<00:04:11.849> hmm<00:04:12.849> so<00:04:13.150> I<00:04:13.180> guess<00:04:13.420> it's<00:04:13.599> a<00:04:13.660> hit<00:04:13.840> or

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
really good hmm so I guess it's a hit or

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.509 
really good hmm so I guess it's a hit or
miss<00:04:13.989> on<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.349> paint<00:04:14.530> job<00:04:14.620> one<00:04:14.950> could<00:04:15.190> see<00:04:15.340> this

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
miss on the paint job one could see this

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.060 
miss on the paint job one could see this
I'm<00:04:15.700> like<00:04:15.879> it's<00:04:16.090> not<00:04:16.180> smeared<00:04:16.600> or<00:04:16.720> anything<00:04:17.070> so

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
I'm like it's not smeared or anything so

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.310 
I'm like it's not smeared or anything so
like<00:04:18.280> with<00:04:18.459> this<00:04:18.639> one<00:04:18.900> you<00:04:19.900> know<00:04:20.019> it's<00:04:20.139> all

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
like with this one you know it's all

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.750 
like with this one you know it's all
smeared<00:04:20.680> around<00:04:20.829> his<00:04:21.040> eyes<00:04:21.190> this<00:04:21.459> was<00:04:21.639> all

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
smeared around his eyes this was all

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.310 
smeared around his eyes this was all
clean<00:04:22.030> I<00:04:22.240> guess<00:04:22.720> it's<00:04:22.900> different<00:04:22.930> different

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
clean I guess it's different different

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.050

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
three different kind out of six I guess

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.250 
three different kind out of six I guess
it's<00:04:27.639> not<00:04:27.760> so<00:04:27.970> bad<00:04:28.150> nice<00:04:28.479> we<00:04:28.630> didn't<00:04:28.870> get<00:04:28.960> only
