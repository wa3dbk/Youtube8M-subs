what<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.180> just<00:00:18.420> heard<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.869> this<00:00:19.199> drum<00:00:19.619> loop

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
what you just heard is this drum loop

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.840 
what you just heard is this drum loop
which<00:00:20.490> has<00:00:20.670> been<00:00:20.850> pulverized<00:00:21.539> as<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:22.080> can<00:00:22.230> see

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
which has been pulverized as you can see

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.939 
which has been pulverized as you can see
being<00:00:23.850> further<00:00:24.210> processed<00:00:24.869> by<00:00:25.140> using<00:00:25.380> radical

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.920 

you

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.910 

and<00:02:01.310> then<00:02:02.310> I'm<00:02:02.430> going<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.700> copy<00:02:02.940> this<00:02:03.240> cord<00:02:03.600> and

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
and then I'm going to copy this cord and

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.650 
and then I'm going to copy this cord and
paste<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.130> across<00:02:05.460> almost<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.150> whole<00:02:06.360> range

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
paste it across almost the whole range

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:23.660 
paste it across almost the whole range
of<00:02:06.870> the<00:02:06.990> piano<00:02:07.260> I<00:02:22.190> don't<00:02:23.190> want<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.400> hear<00:02:23.520> the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
of the piano I don't want to hear the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.330 
of the piano I don't want to hear the
Hammers<00:02:24.000> strike<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.480> strings<00:02:25.010> so<00:02:26.010> I'm<00:02:26.130> going

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
Hammers strike the strings so I'm going

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.610 
Hammers strike the strings so I'm going
to<00:02:26.370> hit<00:02:26.550> command<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.600> select<00:02:27.630> all<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.410> notes

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
to hit command a to select all the notes

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.820 
to hit command a to select all the notes
and<00:02:28.970> turn<00:02:29.970> their<00:02:30.209> velocity<00:02:30.840> down<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.380> a<00:02:31.410> value

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
and turn their velocity down to a value

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.180 
and turn their velocity down to a value
of<00:02:31.860> one<00:02:32.840> I'll<00:02:33.840> also<00:02:34.110> turn<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.739> resonance

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
of one I'll also turn the resonance

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.280 
of one I'll also turn the resonance
release<00:02:35.520> time<00:02:35.880> all<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.330> way<00:02:36.450> down<00:02:36.690> so<00:02:37.260> that

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
release time all the way down so that

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.930 
release time all the way down so that
the<00:02:37.500> notes<00:02:37.620> outside<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.489> D<00:02:38.610> minor<00:02:38.850> chord

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
the notes outside of the D minor chord

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:47.360 
the notes outside of the D minor chord
will<00:02:39.360> not<00:02:39.570> ring<00:02:39.840> out

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.070 

okay<00:02:48.370> on<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.790> fourth<00:02:49.120> bar<00:02:49.390> this<00:02:49.599> loop

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
okay on the fourth bar this loop

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.229 
okay on the fourth bar this loop
I'd<00:02:50.410> like<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.830> cord<00:02:51.099> to<00:02:51.220> change<00:02:51.459> to<00:02:51.730> C<00:02:51.940> minor

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
I'd like the cord to change to C minor

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.380 
I'd like the cord to change to C minor
so<00:02:53.020> I'm<00:02:53.140> holding<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.650> alt/option<00:02:54.099> key<00:02:54.220> as<00:02:54.970> I

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
so I'm holding the alt/option key as I

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.960 
so I'm holding the alt/option key as I
copy<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:55.900> drag<00:02:56.140> all<00:02:56.500> these<00:02:56.680> notes<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.310> drop

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
copy and drag all these notes and drop

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.690 
copy and drag all these notes and drop
them<00:02:58.180> a<00:02:58.269> full<00:02:58.450> step<00:02:58.720> lower<00:02:59.310> the<00:03:00.310> sound<00:03:00.519> you

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
them a full step lower the sound you

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.759 
them a full step lower the sound you
hear<00:03:00.730> is<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.120> mechanical<00:03:01.810> noise<00:03:02.019> of<00:03:02.349> pressing

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
hear is the mechanical noise of pressing

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.160 
hear is the mechanical noise of pressing

down<00:03:05.440> you<00:03:06.400> can<00:03:06.519> do<00:03:06.640> that<00:03:06.760> right<00:03:06.970> here<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:09.239> I'll

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
down you can do that right here and I'll

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:11.880 
down you can do that right here and I'll
shorten<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:10.750> duration<00:03:10.900> of<00:03:11.319> the<00:03:11.470> C<00:03:11.650> minor

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
shorten the duration of the C minor

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.880 
shorten the duration of the C minor

what<00:03:15.010> this<00:03:15.130> sounds<00:03:15.489> like<00:03:24.209> now<00:03:25.209> this<00:03:25.420> is

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
what this sounds like now this is

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.170
