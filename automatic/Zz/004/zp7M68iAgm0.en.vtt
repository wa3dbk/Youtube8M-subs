00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.900
 i 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.310
 I know that the mind 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.410
 these are the styles to take search 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.410
 back 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.220
 the lighting is everything 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.990
 about having sitting looking for a 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.890
 eliminated the natural light that better 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:55.580
 or at least artificial either a little or 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.580
 near your window 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.019
 remember not to take photos against the sun 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:03.260
 this can cause an image 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.449
 obscura number 2 considers the rule of 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.760
 my thirds think about the distribution of 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.190
 your picture before taking it 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.890
 this cell looks for the lead option to 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.700
 see the lines and adjust the object 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.210
 main directly in one time 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.640
 the number 3 use with two keys you can 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.560
 use a white or light background just from a 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.299
 clean and consistent aspect to what 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.619
 you want unfortunately you can use a 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.619
 cardboard a white wall 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.219
 number 4 stabilize your forms a photo 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.140
 with your cell phone moving may result 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:40.000
 a blurred image uses any 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.460
 thing to support you 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.410
 or if it is possible to use the arms to 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.270
 hold your cell phone this will give you more 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.270
 stability and will improve your photos 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.880
 there is cleaning under coast that also 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.430
 they can be very useful 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.640
 number 5 avoid the most that can be 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.740
 Beach 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.659
 the cell phone flash regularly 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.060
 it does not work correctly 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.530
 red eyes yellow skin blurred surroundings 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.750
 are some of the aspects that 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.030
 cause the institution seeks a 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.100
 additional source of light a bit close 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.580
 turn on the lights or make it have 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.580
 windows 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.580
 you will not experience the taking of 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.330
 Photographs 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.430
 although it seems 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.710
 nor do I have issues to put ideas into practice 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.130
 rare the result can even 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.530
 surprise you improvise number 7 no 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.120
 you limit works a photo takes several 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.270
 photographs of the idea that explanation 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.160
 in all the time I say 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.870
 in this way they can correct this 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.980
 initial mistakes and improve their 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.730
 results 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.350
 number 8 uses camera applications 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.400
 some camera apps gives you the 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.200
 opportunity to adjust the shots 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.129
 you take a minute to learn the 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.129
 preferred options 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.450
 number 9 trim bad 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.170
 when you use the image it began to fill up 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.519
 of noise and losing definition and achievements 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.980
 Take the picture with the greatest 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.840
 possible resolution subsequently enters 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.989
 to the editor that you have and cut only the 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.420
 part you need and share your 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.819
 Photographs 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.680
 Share your work in social networks 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.630
 this may generate criticism 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.090
 constructive that will serve you in your 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.129
 future jobs 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.750
