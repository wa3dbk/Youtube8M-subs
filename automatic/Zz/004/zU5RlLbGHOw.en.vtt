 Hi. How are you? Today I want to explain how to treat cuticles. 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.069
 We need a remover, which is creamy and an orange palíto. 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:22.070
 Well, let's apply the cuticle remover. That what helps us is to soften and go little 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:29.070
 little by eliminating the cuticle that we have in excess. We are giving in each finger and we leave 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:38.900
 enough to soften it. And then with the orange stick what we do 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.850
 is to go (I'm going to remove a little bit) to go backwards little by little, okay? 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:58.100
 With the side that is more planito we are doing it. We are pushing and so we are going little by little 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.400
 trying so that then not much cuticle comes out and we do not have to cut it. So, if 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.159
 We do this every week, it's going to facilitate that so we do not have so much cuticle and 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.039
 we do not have to go then cutting it with pliers or with scissors that you usually do. 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:19.460
 Because the more we cut the more the cuticles will come out. 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.920
 So little by little we are removing it back there and it is weak, we do not have 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.810
 that go hurting; just a little bit there and little by little they are going to separate. 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.810
 And when we finish we put a little hydrating cream in each area of ​​the cuticle 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:44.049
 and we give a little massage. We are going there doing a little massage, withdrawing 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.710
 Likewise, backwards what we have worked with the orange stick. There the whole area 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:02:02.700
 of the cuticle. Well, we have them ready and prepared there 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.729
 the ones. I hope you find it useful to use it 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.190
 that you practice You can follow us on social networks, 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:20.190

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.360
