hello friends welcome to the music

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.330 
hello friends welcome to the music
program<00:00:09.480> and<00:00:09.660> today<00:00:10.200> I<00:00:10.230> am<00:00:10.290> going<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.620> tell<00:00:10.860> how

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
program and today I am going to tell how

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.110 
program and today I am going to tell how
to<00:00:11.370> find<00:00:11.910> squares<00:00:12.719> in<00:00:13.200> few<00:00:13.769> seconds<00:00:14.190> one<00:00:14.790> few

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
to find squares in few seconds one few

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.450 
to find squares in few seconds one few
seconds<00:00:15.570> only<00:00:15.780> you<00:00:16.350> can<00:00:16.500> find<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:16.949> path<00:00:17.250> of

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
seconds only you can find this path of

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.779 
seconds only you can find this path of
any<00:00:17.609> number<00:00:17.850> okay<00:00:18.630> so<00:00:19.080> let's<00:00:19.470> take<00:00:19.710> an<00:00:19.890> example

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
any number okay so let's take an example

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.050 
any number okay so let's take an example
okay<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.300> find<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.410> square<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.859> 48<00:00:23.699> okay<00:00:24.000> so

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
okay this find the square of 48 okay so

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.540 
okay this find the square of 48 okay so
40<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.510> square<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:25.500> we<00:00:25.650> can<00:00:25.800> find<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.189> squares

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
40 is square so we can find the squares

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.540 
40 is square so we can find the squares
of<00:00:26.699> 48<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:27.960> two<00:00:28.199> parts<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:28.710> first<00:00:28.980> point<00:00:29.310> will

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
of 48 in two parts so first point will

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.299 
of 48 in two parts so first point will
be<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:30.330> number<00:00:31.730> minus<00:00:32.960> 25<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.920> second

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
be the number minus 25 and the second

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.430 
be the number minus 25 and the second
part<00:00:35.520> will<00:00:35.760> be<00:00:35.960> 50<00:00:36.960> minus<00:00:37.860> number<00:00:39.440> whole

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
part will be 50 minus number whole

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.619 
part will be 50 minus number whole
square<00:00:40.829> only<00:00:41.280> just<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.149> have<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.420> remember

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
square only just you have to remember

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.990 
square only just you have to remember
this<00:00:42.989> okay<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.950> first<00:00:44.190> part<00:00:44.579> will<00:00:44.760> be<00:00:44.910> the

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
this okay so the first part will be the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.479 
this okay so the first part will be the
number<00:00:45.120> minus<00:00:45.750> 45<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.829> 48<00:00:47.600> minus<00:00:48.739> 25<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.100> 48

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
number minus 45 so 48 minus 25 so 48

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.840 
number minus 45 so 48 minus 25 so 48
minus<00:00:51.000> 25<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.680> 23<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.250> will<00:00:53.460> become<00:00:53.579> our

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
minus 25 is 23 so this will become our

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.970 
minus 25 is 23 so this will become our
first<00:00:54.120> part<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:55.079> second<00:00:55.410> part<00:00:55.469> will<00:00:55.860> be

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
first part and the second part will be

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.229 
first part and the second part will be
50<00:00:56.820> minus<00:00:57.210> number<00:00:57.629> hold<00:00:58.590> square<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.980> 50<00:00:59.850> minus

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
50 minus number hold square to 50 minus

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.700 
50 minus number hold square to 50 minus
48<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.620> 50<00:01:02.070> minus<00:01:02.489> 48<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.690> 2<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
48 so 50 minus 48 that is 2 so the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.690 
48 so 50 minus 48 that is 2 so the
square<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.040> 2<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.640> 4<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:07.350> we<00:01:07.380> will<00:01:07.619> get<00:01:07.770> 0<00:01:08.430> food

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
square of 2 is 4 so we will get 0 food

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.880 
square of 2 is 4 so we will get 0 food
always<00:01:08.970> lie<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.960> second<00:01:10.320> part<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
always lie in the second part and the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.149 
always lie in the second part and the
first<00:01:11.130> part<00:01:11.369> in<00:01:12.030> two<00:01:12.510> digits<00:01:12.900> okay<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.470> user

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
first part in two digits okay so a user

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.810 
first part in two digits okay so a user
mostly<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:16.020> will<00:01:16.140> get<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.590> answer<00:01:16.979> into

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
mostly the you will get the answer into

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.130 
mostly the you will get the answer into
it<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.770> remember<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.799> keep<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.939> digits<00:01:21.840> into

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
it so remember that keep the digits into

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.300 
it so remember that keep the digits into
divs<00:01:22.590> okay<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.280> answer<00:01:23.640> will<00:01:23.790> be<00:01:23.970> 2<00:01:24.420> 3<00:01:24.810> 0<00:01:25.049> 4<00:01:25.740> okay

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
divs okay so answer will be 2 3 0 4 okay

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.429 
divs okay so answer will be 2 3 0 4 okay
let's<00:01:26.939> take<00:01:27.180> one<00:01:27.360> more<00:01:27.540> example<00:01:28.369> let<00:01:29.369> us<00:01:29.400> take

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
let's take one more example let us take

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.929 
let's take one more example let us take
52<00:01:31.439> square<00:01:31.890> okay<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:34.220> now<00:01:35.220> first<00:01:35.549> step<00:01:35.759> is

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
52 square okay so now first step is

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.910 
52 square okay so now first step is
number<00:01:36.540> minus<00:01:36.869> 45<00:01:37.409> for<00:01:37.920> number<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.400> 52<00:01:39.090> 52

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
number minus 45 for number is 52 52

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.120 
number minus 45 for number is 52 52
minus<00:01:40.920> 25<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:42.390> second<00:01:42.810> step<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.290> 50<00:01:43.740> minus

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
minus 25 and the second step is 50 minus

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.810 
minus 25 and the second step is 50 minus
number<00:01:44.520> 50<00:01:45.210> minus<00:01:45.570> 50<00:01:45.750> 2<00:01:46.110> whole<00:01:46.920> square

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
number 50 minus 50 2 whole square

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.890 
number 50 minus 50 2 whole square
so<00:01:48.480> the<00:01:48.600> first<00:01:48.840> part<00:01:49.140> will<00:01:49.380> become<00:01:49.740> how<00:01:49.890> much

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
so the first part will become how much

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.760 
so the first part will become how much
27<00:01:51.900> and<00:01:53.030> second<00:01:54.030> part<00:01:54.270> will<00:01:54.450> be<00:01:54.630> 59<00:01:55.440> she<00:01:55.590> pretty

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
27 and second part will be 59 she pretty

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.650 
27 and second part will be 59 she pretty
-<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:56.190> manage<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.700> whole<00:01:56.850> square<00:01:57.120> minus<00:01:57.300> 4

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
- to manage to the whole square minus 4

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.280 
- to manage to the whole square minus 4
so<00:01:58.200> 0<00:01:58.520> so<00:01:59.520> in<00:01:59.640> this<00:01:59.820> way<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.270> can<00:02:00.720> find<00:02:01.020> the

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
so 0 so in this way you can find the

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.210 
so 0 so in this way you can find the
squares<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.280> any<00:02:02.580> number<00:02:02.820> ok<00:02:03.480> so<00:02:04.320> now<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:04.980> am

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220

102 okay so 102 square so as a simple

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.950 
102 okay so 102 square so as a simple
process<00:02:28.130> first<00:02:29.130> what<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:29.370> have<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.790> do<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:30.780> is

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
process first what I have to do it is

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.050 
process first what I have to do it is
how<00:02:31.170> much<00:02:31.380> more<00:02:31.680> than<00:02:31.920> hand<00:02:32.160> then<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.700> is<00:02:32.850> 2

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
how much more than hand then it is 2

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.300 
how much more than hand then it is 2
more<00:02:33.270> than<00:02:33.330> hundred<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:34.290> add<00:02:34.500> 2<00:02:34.830> in<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.190> number

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
more than hundred so add 2 in the number

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.690 
more than hundred so add 2 in the number
so<00:02:35.850> it<00:02:35.940> will<00:02:36.090> become<00:02:36.390> 100<00:02:36.990> and<00:02:37.140> 400<00:02:37.650> 2<00:02:38.220> plus<00:02:38.490> 2

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
so it will become 100 and 400 2 plus 2

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.270 
so it will become 100 and 400 2 plus 2
so<00:02:39.240> it<00:02:39.360> is<00:02:39.390> greater<00:02:39.840> for<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.620> how<00:02:40.800> much<00:02:40.980> more

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
so it is greater for so how much more

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.220 
so it is greater for so how much more
than<00:02:41.430> hundred<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.850> more<00:02:42.030> than<00:02:42.150> so<00:02:42.990> in<00:02:43.140> the

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
than hundred to more than so in the

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.430 
than hundred to more than so in the
second<00:02:43.560> part<00:02:43.620> do<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.459> square<00:02:44.900> will<00:02:45.900> become<00:02:46.020> 0

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
second part do the square will become 0

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.250 
second part do the square will become 0
for<00:02:46.620> for<00:02:47.580> us<00:02:47.760> every<00:02:48.150> one<00:02:48.360> 0<00:02:48.690> cause<00:02:48.959> you<00:02:49.140> go

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
for for us every one 0 cause you go

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.310 
for for us every one 0 cause you go
forth<00:02:49.500> let's<00:02:50.190> take<00:02:50.459> one<00:02:50.640> more<00:02:50.670> example<00:02:51.320> that

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
forth let's take one more example that

00:02:52.320 --> 00:03:01.220 
forth let's take one more example that
is<00:02:54.110> 120<00:02:55.110> square<00:02:55.620> or<00:02:56.510> 180<00:02:57.510> square<00:02:57.900> okay<00:02:58.890> so<00:03:00.230> it

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
is 120 square or 180 square okay so it

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.050 
is 120 square or 180 square okay so it
is<00:03:01.380> how<00:03:01.500> much<00:03:01.709> more<00:03:01.920> than<00:03:02.070> hundred<00:03:02.400> eight<00:03:02.700> more

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
is how much more than hundred eight more

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.810 
is how much more than hundred eight more
than<00:03:03.209> so<00:03:04.050> add<00:03:04.260> it<00:03:04.590> in<00:03:04.980> this<00:03:05.130> only<00:03:05.340> headed<00:03:05.730> a

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
than so add it in this only headed a

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.620 
than so add it in this only headed a
hundred<00:03:06.660> plus<00:03:07.050> Katie's<00:03:07.410> house<00:03:07.910> 160<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.150> our

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
hundred plus Katie's house 160 and our

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.540 
hundred plus Katie's house 160 and our
second<00:03:09.989> part<00:03:10.140> will<00:03:10.380> be<00:03:10.560> is<00:03:10.950> 8<00:03:11.280> more<00:03:11.519> than

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
second part will be is 8 more than

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.030 
second part will be is 8 more than
hundreds<00:03:12.000> for<00:03:12.180> H<00:03:12.300> square<00:03:12.690> that<00:03:12.720> is<00:03:12.959> 60<00:03:13.320> good<00:03:13.530> so

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
hundreds for H square that is 60 good so

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.630 
hundreds for H square that is 60 good so
roughly<00:03:14.220> one<00:03:14.880> one<00:03:15.090> six<00:03:15.390> six<00:03:16.080> fourth<00:03:16.489> so<00:03:17.489> in

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
roughly one one six six fourth so in

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.850 
roughly one one six six fourth so in
this<00:03:17.760> way<00:03:18.000> we<00:03:18.420> can<00:03:18.570> find<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.959> squares<00:03:19.350> of<00:03:19.590> any

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
this way we can find the squares of any

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.000 
this way we can find the squares of any
number<00:03:20.070> ok<00:03:20.580> so<00:03:21.120> thank<00:03:21.390> you<00:03:21.540> guys<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:22.010> for
