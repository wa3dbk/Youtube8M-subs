will<00:00:32.660> develop<00:00:33.080> a<00:00:33.200> simple<00:00:33.530> program<00:00:33.920> using<00:00:34.670> the

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
will develop a simple program using the

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.930 
will develop a simple program using the

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.880 

so<00:00:41.510> here<00:00:41.720> we<00:00:41.810> have<00:00:42.020> the<00:00:42.170> Microsoft<00:00:42.500> Visual

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
so here we have the Microsoft Visual

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.190 
so here we have the Microsoft Visual

Basic software on the screen and we're

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.050 
Basic software on the screen and we're
going<00:00:45.380> to<00:00:45.470> just<00:00:45.650> drag<00:00:45.980> a<00:00:46.010> button<00:00:46.280> over<00:00:46.670> onto
