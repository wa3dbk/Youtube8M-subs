see as normal stem a young stem who it

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.720 
see as normal stem a young stem who it
is<00:04:06.930> very<00:04:07.200> smooth<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:07.709> slender<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.310> skin<00:04:08.579> is

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
is very smooth and slender the skin is

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.690 
is very smooth and slender the skin is
like<00:04:08.940> baby<00:04:09.209> life<00:04:09.510> but<00:04:10.079> as<00:04:10.200> we<00:04:10.349> start<00:04:10.620> aging<00:04:10.829> the

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
like baby life but as we start aging the

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.849 
like baby life but as we start aging the
skin<00:04:12.450> cells<00:04:12.750> they<00:04:12.989> become<00:04:13.290> dead<00:04:13.560> and<00:04:13.769> they

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
skin cells they become dead and they

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.339 
skin cells they become dead and they
don't<00:04:13.980> exfoliate<00:04:14.340> they<00:04:15.120> don't<00:04:15.329> fall<00:04:15.569> off<00:04:15.599> by

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
don't exfoliate they don't fall off by

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:18.110 
don't exfoliate they don't fall off by
themselves<00:04:16.590> but<00:04:17.310> what<00:04:17.519> this<00:04:17.700> does<00:04:17.940> is<00:04:18.090> this

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
themselves but what this does is this

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.120 
themselves but what this does is this
exceeds<00:04:18.660> your<00:04:18.840> moisture<00:04:19.289> from<00:04:19.469> inside<00:04:19.890> it

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
exceeds your moisture from inside it

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.730 
exceeds your moisture from inside it
keeps<00:04:20.820> it<00:04:21.030> keeps<00:04:21.570> it<00:04:21.750> inside<00:04:21.989> and<00:04:22.409> it<00:04:22.530> brings

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
keeps it keeps it inside and it brings

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.090 
keeps it keeps it inside and it brings
your<00:04:23.070> dead<00:04:23.280> cells<00:04:23.550> out

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
your dead cells out

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.760 
your dead cells out
so<00:04:24.400> that's<00:04:24.610> how<00:04:25.030> it<00:04:25.420> actually<00:04:25.690> prevents<00:04:26.530> the

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
so that's how it actually prevents the

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.440 
so that's how it actually prevents the
moisture<00:04:27.190> to<00:04:27.370> disappear<00:04:27.850> from<00:04:28.030> your<00:04:28.150> body

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
which is the number one cause of skin

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.820 
which is the number one cause of skin
aging<00:04:30.490> so<00:04:31.270> and<00:04:31.540> that<00:04:31.780> takes<00:04:32.080> care<00:04:32.260> of<00:04:32.320> most<00:04:32.650> of

the products and like there are two
things<00:04:35.470> important<00:04:35.980> for<00:04:36.130> life<00:04:36.310> number<00:04:36.730> one<00:04:36.940> is

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
things important for life number one is

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.690 
things important for life number one is
oxygen<00:04:37.810> number<00:04:38.080> two<00:04:38.200> is<00:04:38.290> water<00:04:38.560> it<00:04:39.190> lets<00:04:39.550> the

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
oxygen number two is water it lets the

oxygen number two is water it lets the
oxygen<00:04:40.180> breathe<00:04:40.390> in<00:04:40.570> and<00:04:40.750> prevents<00:04:41.740> the<00:04:41.890> water

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
oxygen breathe in and prevents the water

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.470 
oxygen breathe in and prevents the water
going<00:04:42.280> out<00:04:42.520> which<00:04:42.760> is<00:04:42.790> the<00:04:42.940> root<00:04:43.180> cause<00:04:43.450> of
