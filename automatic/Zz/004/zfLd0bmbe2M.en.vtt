00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
was actually pretty simple to make we

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.840 
was actually pretty simple to make we
found<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:58.800> much<00:00:58.890> iron<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.520> rails<00:00:59.699> were

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
found so much iron that the rails were

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.700 
found so much iron that the rails were
easy<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.149> make<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:01.140> found<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.379> little<00:01:01.500> bit<00:01:01.649> of

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
easy to make we found a little bit of

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.200 
easy to make we found a little bit of
gold<00:01:01.859> we<00:01:02.010> found<00:01:02.190> actually<00:01:02.489> just<00:01:02.820> enough<00:01:03.030> gold

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
gold we found actually just enough gold

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.960 
gold we found actually just enough gold
like<00:01:03.449> we've<00:01:03.629> like<00:01:04.140> literally<00:01:04.530> no<00:01:04.799> more<00:01:05.070> power

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
like we've like literally no more power

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.730 
like we've like literally no more power
rails<00:01:06.270> no<00:01:06.479> more<00:01:06.689> gold<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.080> make<00:01:07.200> power<00:01:07.439> rails

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
rails no more gold to make power rails

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.620 
rails no more gold to make power rails
even<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.159> mean<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.369> have<00:01:08.580> two<00:01:09.030> pieces<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.360> gold

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
even I mean I have two pieces of gold

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.300 
even I mean I have two pieces of gold
right<00:01:09.750> here<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:10.320> need<00:01:10.470> six<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.860> make<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> power

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
right here you need six to make a power

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.310 
right here you need six to make a power
rail<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.330> we<00:01:12.420> had<00:01:12.510> just<00:01:12.840> enough<00:01:13.020> power

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
rail and so we had just enough power

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.480 
rail and so we had just enough power
rails<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.770> make<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.070> infinite

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
rails to make this infinite

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.620 
rails to make this infinite

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.820 
coaster that takes you from a spawn to
the<00:02:49.700> ranch<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.150> I<00:02:51.020> guess<00:02:51.260> back<00:02:51.530> from<00:02:51.739> the

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
the ranch and I guess back from the

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.860 
the ranch and I guess back from the
ranch<00:02:51.980> back<00:02:52.430> to<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.670> spawn<00:02:52.910> we<00:02:53.420> have<00:02:53.570> that<00:02:53.750> as

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
ranch back to the spawn we have that as

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.320 
ranch back to the spawn we have that as
well<00:02:54.280> but<00:02:55.280> I<00:02:55.370> might<00:02:55.489> be<00:02:55.610> showing<00:02:55.760> that<00:02:55.910> up<00:02:56.120> so

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
well but I might be showing that up so

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.180 
well but I might be showing that up so
it's<00:02:56.480> not<00:02:56.600> as<00:02:57.020> though<00:02:57.080> it's<00:02:57.410> not<00:02:57.470> overly<00:02:57.770> big<00:02:58.040> I

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
it's not as though it's not overly big I

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.440 
it's not as though it's not overly big I
guess<00:02:58.340> when<00:02:58.459> I<00:02:58.520> do<00:02:58.640> a<00:02:58.670> walk<00:02:58.880> through<00:02:59.090> the<00:02:59.209> world

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
guess when I do a walk through the world

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.360 
guess when I do a walk through the world
and<00:02:59.660> my<00:02:59.750> next<00:03:00.050> you<00:03:00.470> know<00:03:00.530> next<00:03:00.800> time<00:03:00.920> I<00:03:00.980> decided

and my next you know next time I decided

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.979 
and my next you know next time I decided
