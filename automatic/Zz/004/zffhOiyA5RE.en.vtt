00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:14.629
 his transparent pregón presents martín 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.629
 Muñoz and his transparent and loyal proclamation 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.570
 good since we are with bad smell or bad 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.300
 Tuesday 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.160
 equally for martín very well for 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.980
 lucky very willing to work and 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.890
 then super super cute and novel and with 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.710
 people are going to love this 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:44.530
 because you told me it looks like rubber 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:47.379
 8 is expensive but this is the king of the 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.059
 molds nobody avoids that but sometimes in 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.190
 house we have to copy something we have to 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.190
 do something and we do not have access to rubber 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.649
 here we do not know how to get it and good 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.360
 we have a solution that is very good 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:03.100
 it's super easy and economical that the most 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.720
 important so it's good that's how it is then 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.729
 as we said with the norm is a 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.259
 solution for all of us who are in 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.750
 home and we need to do something we are 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.729
 copy something good they will see how nice and 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.619
 how easy it is we are going to do it with 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.840
 what are we going to do with the silicone 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.880
 supra bond in this case is a silicone 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.190
 obviously the silicone that we 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.780
 We usually use good to grab 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.540
 the glasses for all that kind of stuff 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.520
 well what I'm going to do is the following 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.170
 in this case I'm going to use these knobs that 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.500
 they are super easy we cut with the scissors 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.420
 and as they have the cap we can 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.680
 save things that do not happen to us 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.470
 with other products 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.210
 end up drying in this case we're going to 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.520
 then use this silicone and something else 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.490
 that we get in any hardware store 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.410
 I tell you this material we the 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.560
 silicone we place it in some 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.210
 hardware store in a bookstore and what 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.250
 I'm going to show you now that it's also 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.290
 very, very economic, we got it in 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.990
 any hardware store that is chalk in 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.850
 chalk powder powder chalk powder that 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.220
 it comes like this white color and do not get scared 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.020
 if with the humidity of the silicone it changes 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.360
 a little more brownish color because 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.459
 that can happen but nothing happens 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.650
 is that the mixture is wrong they will see it 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.990
 always white well then we're going to 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.700
 place the chalk look what you prepare here 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.670
 at the table I prepared before anything 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.160
 film paper I grabbed the film and put two 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.200
 inserts to work comfortably and what 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.250
 let's do then is to place all 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.880
 Chalk 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.640
 so I have here in a bowl on the 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.670
 film well once I have this I'm going to 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.500
 place the silicone then and I'll 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.440
 work with the silicone doing 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.180
 Pressure 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.969
 and we are going to place 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.010
 how much to see you guys are going to work from 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:47.329
 according to what they want to copy 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.010
 obviously I in this case like I'm going to 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.750
 copy something that is not too big 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.189
 I will work with these amounts 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.390
 what are the amounts for if 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.750
 you will always work with this 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.120
 2 in 12 ratio of chalk and one of 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.099
 silicone well is nothing more than that look 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.450
 how easy I put it here on paper 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.400
 film nothing but because it is the 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.049
 neat but because we are going to knead here 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.659
 of film paper how are we going to do like this 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:11.239
 we take the film paper first I'm going to 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:14.689
 place enough chalk on the silicone 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:18.409
 see how I'm doing it and now together 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:22.489
 to film paper in this way I'm going to take 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:26.090
 I will remove the air and I'll screw to 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:29.989
 this mode is firm and well 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.730
 let's start kneading on paper 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.370
 film that I have here and we are going to go 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.439
 working over and over again until 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.270
 this take body will take the body 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:41.430
 like from a kind of nice play dough 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.930
 then let's go to the beginning 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.670
 so you do not get scared 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.920
 little bit of time they have time to 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.770
 work this is another advantage so 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.660
 work super quiet and let's go 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.300
 working all this until it 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.010
 way that until this is formed as 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.780
 what I have here and see that I 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.820
 I said that sometimes you can change color 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.950
 do not be scared because it is normal some 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.750
 Chalks are very white but after 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.250
 when they come in contact with moisture 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.200
 put of this other and others are 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.620
 white then once I already have 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.200
 this mass I open the film film 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.290
 and we will work with the mass as 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.510
 let's start to unify the best 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:23.560
 what can i do well 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.240
 we do as well as a kind of little ball and 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.950
 once I get this we are going to withdraw 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.780
 film paper I'm going to what I want to copy 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.160
 in this case I'm going to copy the same thing 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.020
 I copied for all of you so that 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.430
 you can see it I will copy the sun or the 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:38.650
 moon then I work with the dough 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.410
 on 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.210
 the way that I want to copy so we go 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.970
 to work absolutely everything 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.130
 covering it well even if we have the 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.229
 option we can go around and see 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.030
 that we do not have air on the other side 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:54.850
 then we can get up and go back to 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.979
 withdraw so let's cover absolutely 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.639
 everything once we cover everything we go 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:03.759
 to leave approximately between 4 or 6 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.169
 hours I work alone this is more if 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:07.120
 they want to leave it together for the other what 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:09.220
 they can leave also and once 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.320
 They have roughly a 4 to 6 hours at 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.380
 they will withdraw super easy discount no 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.639
 you have to put neither silicone nor anything to 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.380
 that no people take off from 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:20.199
 takeoff directly is going to take off 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.440
 will take the shine according to 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:25.510
 brightness of the part to be copied if 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.010
 it has texture it will take the texture so 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.919
 copy just look what I'm going to show you 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.900
 how is one here finished so that 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:35.260
 you see that I copied absolutely the 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.270
 shine and look at the flexibility that it has 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.240
 the mold is I can pour here 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.770
 resin candle what I want soaps 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.419
 it can be what you want 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.610
 is going to take off even this kind of 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:47.710
 There is no need for an agent 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.830
 takeoff to be able to take off the piece 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:53.139
 because the piece is going to repel the mold 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.780
 so this is super easy it 's like that 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:57.849
 quick cut you can do in 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.680
 their houses all the molds they want 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:03.009
 you can copy absolutely everything 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.900
 want so they get to work and 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:07.300
 they are nothing more than two materials a 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.310
 time to knead well and 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.280
 immediately they will be the mold 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:14.229
 you at home how many times do we have 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.360
 something to copy and we do not know what to do 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:17.560
 So here is what you normita 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.819
