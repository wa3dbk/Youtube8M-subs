00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
that but you can see what I'm going for

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.670 
that but you can see what I'm going for
I<00:01:34.650> mean<00:01:34.829> it's<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.159> headshot<00:01:35.610> all<00:01:35.970> he's<00:01:36.180> stunned

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
I mean it's a headshot all he's stunned

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.140 
I mean it's a headshot all he's stunned
so<00:01:37.680> that's<00:01:37.860> what<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.040> mean<00:01:38.159> when<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.790> game's<00:01:39.000> a

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
so that's what I mean when the game's a

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.910 
so that's what I mean when the game's a
bit<00:01:39.299> finicky<00:01:39.509> what<00:01:40.439> do<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.560> think<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:40.890> a

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
bit finicky what do you think is a

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.460 
bit finicky what do you think is a
headshot<00:01:41.250> isn't<00:01:41.549> exactly<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.000> headshot<00:01:42.470> but

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
headshot isn't exactly a headshot but

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.600 
headshot isn't exactly a headshot but
when<00:01:43.619> they<00:01:43.710> were<00:01:43.799> electrocuted<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.490> can

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
when they were electrocuted you can

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.880 
when they were electrocuted you can
easily<00:01:45.060> just<00:01:45.360> aim<00:01:45.930> down<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.290> scope<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.680> just

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
easily just aim down the scope and just

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.060 
easily just aim down the scope and just
zoom<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.280> face<00:01:48.170> so<00:01:49.170> that's<00:01:49.320> me<00:01:49.500> family<00:01:49.799> but

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
zoom in the face so that's me family but

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.149 
zoom in the face so that's me family but
I'm<00:01:50.250> not<00:01:50.399> gonna<00:01:50.659> go<00:01:51.659> back<00:01:51.960> into<00:01:52.170> those<00:01:52.619> waves
