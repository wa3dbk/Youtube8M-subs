those stairs in the building originally
were<00:01:49.909> concrete<00:01:50.909> casts<00:01:51.509> like<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.470> there

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
were concrete casts like so and there

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.560 
were concrete casts like so and there
are<00:01:52.799> only<00:01:52.890> about<00:01:53.340> two<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.939> half<00:01:54.090> feet<00:01:54.299> wide

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
are only about two and a half feet wide

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.480 
are only about two and a half feet wide
and<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.229> walls<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.649> course<00:01:55.890> chip<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.340> and

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
and the walls of course chip in and

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.030 
and the walls of course chip in and
there<00:01:56.579> was<00:01:56.670> no<00:01:57.020> handrails<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.469> what<00:01:58.649> we<00:01:58.770> did<00:01:58.920> to

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
there was no handrails so what we did to

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.370 
there was no handrails so what we did to
make<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.280> stairs<00:01:59.520> more<00:02:00.119> usable<00:02:00.689> we<00:02:01.079> went<00:02:01.290> from

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
make the stairs more usable we went from

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.230 
make the stairs more usable we went from
two<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.740> half<00:02:01.920> feet<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.579> four<00:02:02.820> feet<00:02:03.090> and

it was time to put the floor joists in
we<00:02:24.340> immediately<00:02:24.819> realized<00:02:25.269> that<00:02:25.510> every<00:02:25.989> floor

we immediately realized that every floor
joist<00:02:26.500> was<00:02:26.799> a<00:02:26.830> different<00:02:27.250> length<00:02:27.430> with<00:02:27.940> a

had<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.209> same<00:02:31.450> angles<00:02:31.989> I<00:02:32.200> had<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:32.739> brush<00:02:32.890> up<00:02:33.099> on

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
had the same angles I had to brush up on

had the same angles I had to brush up on
math<00:02:33.459> skills<00:02:33.810> he<00:02:34.810> also<00:02:34.900> got<00:02:35.230> crunched<00:02:35.650> by<00:02:35.769> some

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
math skills he also got crunched by some

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.680 
math skills he also got crunched by some
odd<00:02:36.220> numbers<00:02:36.670> when<00:02:37.150> he<00:02:37.239> attempted<00:02:37.629> to

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
odd numbers when he attempted to

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.350 
odd numbers when he attempted to
handcraft<00:02:38.200> 23<00:02:39.069> round<00:02:39.430> windows<00:02:39.849> to<00:02:40.090> fit<00:02:40.239> the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
handcraft 23 round windows to fit the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.930 
handcraft 23 round windows to fit the
original<00:02:40.840> frames<00:02:41.140> I<00:02:41.519> measured<00:02:42.519> three<00:02:42.790> and

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
original frames I measured three and

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.190 
original frames I measured three and
they<00:02:43.060> were<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.299> same<00:02:43.510> so<00:02:43.690> I<00:02:43.750> assumed

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
they were the same so I assumed

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.380 
they were the same so I assumed
foolishly<00:02:44.950> that<00:02:45.549> there<00:02:45.730> were<00:02:45.790> all<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.150> same

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
foolishly that there were all the same

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.990 
foolishly that there were all the same
so<00:02:47.140> I<00:02:47.170> made<00:02:47.500> all<00:02:47.739> my<00:02:47.950> window<00:02:48.250> is<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.519> same<00:02:48.730> size

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
so I made all my window is the same size

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.330 
so I made all my window is the same size
and<00:02:49.390> found<00:02:49.660> that<00:02:49.810> there<00:02:50.049> are<00:02:50.379> actually

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
and found that there are actually

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.449 
and found that there are actually
anywhere<00:02:51.940> from<00:02:52.180> 22<00:02:52.660> inches<00:02:52.989> to<00:02:53.049> 24<00:02:53.709> and<00:02:53.890> 3/4

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
anywhere from 22 inches to 24 and 3/4

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.970 
anywhere from 22 inches to 24 and 3/4
then<00:02:54.819> I<00:02:54.879> had<00:02:55.150> to<00:02:55.299> go<00:02:55.480> back<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:56.019> remake<00:02:56.530> a<00:02:56.739> lot

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
then I had to go back and remake a lot

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.319 
then I had to go back and remake a lot
of<00:02:57.099> the<00:02:57.160> windows<00:02:57.489> so<00:02:57.700> that<00:02:57.730> they<00:02:57.940> would<00:02:58.090> fit

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
of the windows so that they would fit

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.809 
of the windows so that they would fit
the<00:02:58.480> openings<00:02:59.019> the<00:02:59.950> crown<00:03:00.220> jewel<00:03:00.519> of<00:03:00.549> the

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
the openings the crown jewel of the

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.180 
the openings the crown jewel of the
windmill<00:03:01.180> is<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.569> roof<00:03:01.780> tom<00:03:02.650> had<00:03:02.890> it<00:03:03.010> built

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
windmill is the roof tom had it built

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.599 
windmill is the roof tom had it built
off<00:03:03.519> site<00:03:03.849> and<00:03:03.879> then<00:03:04.329> lifted<00:03:04.750> into<00:03:04.900> position

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
off site and then lifted into position

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.940 
off site and then lifted into position
the<00:03:06.609> roof<00:03:06.940> is<00:03:07.269> a<00:03:07.510> carousel<00:03:08.079> the<00:03:08.530> top<00:03:08.769> of<00:03:08.890> the

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
the roof is a carousel the top of the

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.530 
the roof is a carousel the top of the
walls<00:03:09.190> of<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.519> building<00:03:09.879> are<00:03:10.030> like<00:03:10.209> a<00:03:10.239> little

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
walls of the building are like a little

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.080 
walls of the building are like a little
railroad<00:03:10.780> track<00:03:11.409> and<00:03:11.709> there's<00:03:12.340> cast<00:03:12.700> iron

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090

so<00:03:16.030> that<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.239> roof<00:03:16.930> can<00:03:17.170> be<00:03:17.230> turned<00:03:17.590> to<00:03:17.980> keep
