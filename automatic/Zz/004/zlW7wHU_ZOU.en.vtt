00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.120
 hello everyone with you jed and this is another 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.610
 release of my weekly show 3 in form 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.980
 of today i will tell as usual 3n 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.140
 forms in different price categories all 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.599
 three today are attacking football players and 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.780
 I played here with this composition link to 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:20.539
 the composition is in the description of Well on 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.539
 third place this week I put 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.460
 inform the cable i am but not honorable 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.220
 third place he pleases me because 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.279
 that it was not too useful for 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.890
 I did not see the team on the field rushed 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.489
 in the eyes except that his ancestors and races 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.340
 flank 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.590
 canopies and more generally nothing would 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.219
 a couple of times there have been beating and earned 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.730
 penalties 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.469
 there is no effective action 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.050
 for my team did not bring on the card 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:51.829
 it is clear that he has a good acceleration 91 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.649
 86 acceleration 88 balance is not bad 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.430
 visions yes his stats are all perfect and 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.649
 last for 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.629
 unfortunately remaking it in the right 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.750
 midfielder did not go to his advantage he 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.639
 became less noticed on the field I ca n't you 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.639
 recommend him go to the second 

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:10.490
 ranked second place to complete 

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:12.009
 il Turin's Fabio Quagliarella because of 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.649
 his herds first stand out 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:18.709
 long shot and impact strength and finish young 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.990
 Well, as well as the choice of position despite 

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:24.409
 that this is a forward type ram although I 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.219
 I look at his height is only 180 combat 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:30.799
 I would say that he is so tall 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:33.020
 sluggish to complete il attacks but here 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.179
 because I decided he was tall you 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.240
 guys can themselves understand his manner 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:40.520
 games this is a typical finish Julia so with 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.950
 finish young without good speed 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.549
 blow well with a good long shot a mi 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.399
 you can compare it with the world to the vine 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.849
 Mario Gomez who have an Inform and 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:56.450
 Motom cards, respectively, but on the game 

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:58.639
 he loses them my opinion he is pretty 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.559
 I won't say that very slowly 

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:02.840
 slow but he lacks 

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:04.880
 speeds but if you pair with it 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.399
 some quick hitter 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.979
 which will compensate him 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.170
 lack of speed then most likely your 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.180
 the team will drag thats all i can 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.110
 say about fabio quagliarella he scored off 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.349
 I have two goals 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.099
 one in an empty net one after an error 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.860
 rival 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.550
 such a striker neither fish nor meat in the league 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.680
 there are much better hitters than this 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.130
 well, in the first place is the Italian thunderstorm 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.040
 leagues 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.590
 Jeremy Menze when watching was that no 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.140
 food go it might seem that this 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.090
 the player has such a mediocre price 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.069
 less than one hundred thousand on all platforms 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.239
 but the first impression is deceptive 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.340
 it turns out 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.799
 because guys this is one of the best in 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.900
 form of for which i played first what 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:51.310
 we need the father of the artist that is which 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:55.640
 plays from the attacker ball control 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.890
 dribble speed jerk speed selection 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.190
 all the positions this guy has 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.560
 You see, and the fact that he has there exactly 70 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.170
 free kicks to 68 head done 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.590
 he doesn't need it he doesn't 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:13.430
 needed compared with conventional card at 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.350
 him shouting raised by 10 and he has 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.569
 principle yes there is a very good blow and 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.299
 you will see his masterpiece just a goal 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.910
 which he is right he scored after his 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:25.340
 solo heel pass near corner 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.840
 Howard's gate after that I was even given 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.319
 Some kind of achivka I do not remember how she 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.530
 called and and my opponent could not stand 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.269
 tension and even left the game in too 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.230
 so this guys if you want 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.350
 French 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.299
 mission I could not even say such a thing 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.459
 antoine grizzmann somehow he's not wrong 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:46.480
 like how zheremi menez can be 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.200
 because he has all the stats except 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.870
 accelerating ball control and dribbling 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.400
 low so here these are his greens 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.989
 characteristics stand out 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.239
 they are very felt in the game I do not know 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.850
 maybe because of it maybe because 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.350
 my manners of the game in general if the smoke 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.940
 exactly and for the correct use of it 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.760
 there will be a great grog 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.400
 the perfect playmaker also has 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.290
 at the same time, though with a weak speed 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.530
 posting but how we see see it 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.150
 80 this is basically enough if you 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.680
 will not give passes through the whole field 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.810
 casts as the last bad people here 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.190
 Zheremi Menze highly recommend from myself 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.800
 I can say a very cool player 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.990
 try to play it is not expensive 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.470
 in my opinion it should cost well, thousands 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.030
 two hundred at least because he plays 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.820
 well I have all the guys on it 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.320
