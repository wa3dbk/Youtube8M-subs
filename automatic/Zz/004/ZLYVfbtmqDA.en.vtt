this reel that you won't see it on some
of<00:01:03.559> the<00:01:03.620> other<00:01:03.739> brands<00:01:04.129> out<00:01:04.220> there<00:01:04.280> is<00:01:04.610> a

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
of the other brands out there is a

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.200 
of the other brands out there is a
titanium<00:01:06.320> bill<00:01:06.800> wire<00:01:07.070> so<00:01:07.430> you<00:01:07.490> can<00:01:07.700> bend<00:01:08.000> this

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
titanium bill wire so you can bend this

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.210 
titanium bill wire so you can bend this
and<00:01:08.840> it<00:01:09.050> will<00:01:09.080> always<00:01:09.350> snap<00:01:09.710> back<00:01:09.920> to<00:01:09.950> its

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
and it will always snap back to its

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.420 
and it will always snap back to its
original<00:01:10.340> form<00:01:10.850> it<00:01:11.000> is<00:01:11.119> unbreakable<00:01:12.280> so<00:01:13.280> it's

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
original form it is unbreakable so it's

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.980 
original form it is unbreakable so it's
really<00:01:13.610> really<00:01:13.910> cool<00:01:14.060> it's<00:01:14.270> lightweight<00:01:14.509> and

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
really really cool it's lightweight and

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.020 
really really cool it's lightweight and
again<00:01:15.320> also<00:01:15.500> you<00:01:16.040> can<00:01:16.220> bend<00:01:16.430> it<00:01:16.520> when<00:01:16.940> the

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
again also you can bend it when the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.370 
again also you can bend it when the
other<00:01:17.180> things<00:01:17.390> that<00:01:17.420> this<00:01:17.600> real<00:01:17.810> features<00:01:18.200> is

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
other things that this real features is

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.190 
other things that this real features is
a<00:01:18.649> magnetic<00:01:19.100> bail<00:01:19.490> trip<00:01:19.789> system<00:01:20.240> when<00:01:21.110> the

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
a magnetic bail trip system when the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.170 
a magnetic bail trip system when the
bail<00:01:21.380> is<00:01:21.590> open<00:01:21.950> there<00:01:22.369> are<00:01:22.520> no<00:01:22.640> screams<00:01:22.970> in<00:01:23.149> the

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
bail is open there are no screams in the

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.420 
bail is open there are no screams in the
bail<00:01:23.390> system<00:01:23.660> at<00:01:23.899> all<00:01:24.020> so<00:01:24.770> every<00:01:25.070> time<00:01:25.100> you

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
bail system at all so every time you

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.719 
bail system at all so every time you
turn<00:01:25.640> it<00:01:25.820> it<00:01:25.970> is<00:01:26.450> it<00:01:26.869> trips<00:01:27.320> by<00:01:27.710> magnetic<00:01:28.220> force

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
turn it it is it trips by magnetic force

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.770 
turn it it is it trips by magnetic force
so<00:01:29.450> Springs<00:01:30.410> can<00:01:30.950> fail<00:01:31.220> magnets<00:01:32.060> never<00:01:32.479> will

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
so Springs can fail magnets never will

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.960 
so Springs can fail magnets never will
fail<00:01:33.080> and<00:01:33.770> again<00:01:34.009> it's<00:01:34.190> available<00:01:34.399> on<00:01:34.610> all<00:01:34.789> of
