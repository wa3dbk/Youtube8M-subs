00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
computer and resize it try and figure

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.819 
computer and resize it try and figure
out<00:01:36.000> what<00:01:36.299> size<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:37.020> needs<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.350> be<00:01:37.469> and<00:01:37.649> then

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
out what size it needs to be and then

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.899 
out what size it needs to be and then
put<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.280> back<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:38.719> so<00:01:40.130> here<00:01:41.130> got<00:01:41.729> some

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
put that back in so here got some

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.160 
put that back in so here got some
padding<00:01:42.270> inside<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:43.109> it<00:01:43.320> can<00:01:43.649> be<00:01:43.890> worn<00:01:44.180> um

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.630 

because<00:01:49.170> there's<00:01:49.619> no<00:01:49.740> padding<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.340> would<00:01:50.460> just

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
because there's no padding it would just

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.709 
because there's no padding it would just
like<00:01:50.820> move<00:01:51.060> around<00:01:51.869> on<00:01:52.079> your<00:01:52.259> head<00:01:52.549> um<00:01:55.399> this

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
like move around on your head um this

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:03.499 
like move around on your head um this
probably<00:01:57.719> took<00:01:57.899> me<00:01:58.289> over<00:01:59.240> 15<00:02:00.240> hours<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:02.509> just

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
probably took me over 15 hours of just

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.540 
probably took me over 15 hours of just
work<00:02:03.810> just<00:02:04.560> cutting<00:02:04.950> out<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.399> gluing<00:02:06.530> it<00:02:07.550> is
