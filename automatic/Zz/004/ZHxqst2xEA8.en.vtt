triathlete to the 40 year old triathlete
very<00:00:32.099> similar<00:00:32.610> are<00:00:32.759> they<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.120> fact<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.579> 74

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
very similar are they in fact the 74

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.819 
very similar are they in fact the 74
year<00:00:35.730> old<00:00:35.760> triathlete<00:00:36.390> has<00:00:36.600> less<00:00:36.960> fat<00:00:37.440> there

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829
