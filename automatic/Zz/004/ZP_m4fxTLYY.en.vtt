black and chrome that came out it was a

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.910 
black and chrome that came out it was a
little<00:00:48.840> bit<00:00:49.110> different<00:00:49.410> than<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.860> is

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
little bit different than this this is

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.740 
little bit different than this this is
this<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> little<00:00:50.700> more<00:00:50.850> contrast<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.570> color

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
this is a little more contrast in color

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.869 
this is a little more contrast in color
way<00:00:51.960> as<00:00:52.079> far<00:00:52.230> as<00:00:52.350> how<00:00:52.440> white<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:52.949> it's<00:00:53.820> a

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
way as far as how white this is it's a

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.700 
way as far as how white this is it's a
true<00:00:54.059> black<00:00:54.329> white<00:00:55.850> contrast<00:00:57.230> also<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.440> shoe

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
true black white contrast also this shoe

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.770 
true black white contrast also this shoe
is<00:00:58.920> not<00:00:59.070> nubuck<00:00:59.489> it's<00:00:59.760> it's<00:01:00.059> um<00:01:00.359> it's<00:01:00.660> got

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
is not nubuck it's it's um it's got

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.930 
is not nubuck it's it's um it's got
suede<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.829> longer<00:01:02.039> haired<00:01:02.370> leather

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
suede so it's a longer haired leather

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.910 
suede so it's a longer haired leather
here<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:04.049> definitely<00:01:04.379> gives<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.650> richer

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
here it definitely gives it a richer

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.980 
here it definitely gives it a richer
look<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.280> think<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.580> makes<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.750> black

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
look and I think it makes the the black

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.840 
look and I think it makes the the black
contrast<00:01:07.350> even<00:01:07.680> more<00:01:07.860> with<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.100> white<00:01:08.280> and

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
contrast even more with the white and

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.899 
contrast even more with the white and
makes<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.119> shoe<00:01:09.270> pop<00:01:10.220> up<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.340> top<00:01:11.549> right<00:01:11.760> now

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
makes the shoe pop up on top right now

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.310 
makes the shoe pop up on top right now
being<00:01:12.119> shown<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.600> everybody<00:01:12.930> looks<00:01:13.140> at<00:01:13.290> it

this<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.209> gonna<00:02:18.780> be<00:02:18.840> gone<00:02:19.049> pretty<00:02:19.290> quick<00:02:19.970> but

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
this is gonna be gone pretty quick but

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.180 
this is gonna be gone pretty quick but
definitely<00:02:21.870> check<00:02:22.049> these<00:02:22.200> out<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.739> don't<00:02:23.099> know

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
definitely check these out I don't know

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.949 
definitely check these out I don't know
if<00:02:23.250> they're<00:02:23.340> vows<00:02:23.489> as<00:02:23.700> parents<00:02:24.510> allowances

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
if they're vows as parents allowances

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.339 
if they're vows as parents allowances
got<00:02:25.140> low<00:02:25.319> but<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:26.130> could<00:02:26.280> be<00:02:26.400> harder<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.700> find

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
got low but it could be harder to find

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.420 
got low but it could be harder to find
for<00:02:28.349> that<00:02:28.380> reason<00:02:28.799> it<00:02:28.920> because<00:02:29.099> I<00:02:29.130> think<00:02:29.340> it's

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
for that reason it because I think it's

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.970 
for that reason it because I think it's
more<00:02:29.640> demand<00:02:29.970> for<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.329> and<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.510> think<00:02:30.569> and<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.890> be

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
more demand for it and I think and to be

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.740 
more demand for it and I think and to be
less<00:02:32.190> allocations<00:02:32.819> for<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.150> but<00:02:33.269> anyway<00:02:33.510> just

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
less allocations for it but anyway just

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.300 
less allocations for it but anyway just
don't<00:02:34.380> don't<00:02:34.620> miss<00:02:34.739> out<00:02:34.860> on<00:02:34.890> these<00:02:35.069> is<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.220> good
