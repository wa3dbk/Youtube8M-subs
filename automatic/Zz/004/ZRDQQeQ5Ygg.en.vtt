00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.120
 hello guys let's learn to compare 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:07.480
 numbers of three quotes to see what 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.790
 greater numbers and what number is the least 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.400
 correct look to compare numbers of 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.019
 three figures first we start with the 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.390
 larger amount than in this case is 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:20.980
 people 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:24.030
 according to which memory 129 1531 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:27.880
 it has the biggest hundred 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:33.570
 5 true then in 5 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:38.760
 531 greater than 4 429 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:42.220
 let's see another couple 461 and 438 which 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.280
 CNTE in May are equal 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.350
 If the hundreds are the same, we look at the 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.600
 tens 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.600
 673 which is greater 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:58.600
 then 461 as the largest would be higher 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.659
 that he 438 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.210
 if the hundred is the same we look at the ten 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.340
 and what happens if the hundred and the 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:11.430
 ten are forgiveness 100 have dozens 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:17.250
 they're the same as we look at unit 473 and 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.789
 471 the unit of 3 is greater so 473 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.250
 is older 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:27.250
 that 471 first we compared the hundreds 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.350
 if the tens are equal and if they are 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.390
 same 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.580
 if any were greater then that is the 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.700
 number we are looking for we are going to make a 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.720
 exercise of agreement tells us look for and 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.880
 surrounds the largest number and the smallest number 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.260
 let's look at the first cloud of 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.230
 agreement the higher number 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.570
 we prepare the red that is the color 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:55.080
 and let's compare the hundreds in two 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.600
 is greater than two are not equal we are going to 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.610
 see the next 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.119
 in two the greater or lesser than 3 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.300
 then the greatest is this truth 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.790
 304 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.660
 let's see in the next which number 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:15.460
 it has the biggest hundred 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.110
 This has the biggest 3 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.890
 is 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.810
 is 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:26.000
 four hundred then the 400 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.750
 is the largest number because it has the 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.780
 hundreds more 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.790
 let's see the last cloud 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.030
 4 hundreds 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.930
 eternal uy here there is nothing if there is no 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.930
 nothing is as if there 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.880
 and 4 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.330
 all the hundreds less in this are 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:54.030
 same let's see the tens one 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.940
 ten dozen tens look up the 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.100
 greater nine ten as it is between is 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.750
 all this but let's compare the 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:07.150
 units two units zero units 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.150
 this one has more units than this one 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:16.640
 and now we're going to look for the smaller number 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.060
 the same hundreds 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.069
 let's see the tens seven tens 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.910
 six tens this is less that is more 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:28.400
 small we surround this let's see the 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.790
 following three hundred three hundred 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.459
 three centers 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.220
 well we compared the tens eight tens 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.040
 nine scenes this is less 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.840
 eight tens nine tens this follows 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:46.160
 being smaller as we surround 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:51.340
 and the last four hundred zero 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.340
 hundreds four centers the minors 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.270
 when they do not have any written number 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.860
 it's like I have zero hundred 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.920
 We review quickly to compare 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.110
 numbers first we look at people if they are 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.800
 we look at the tens and if they are 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:10.080
 equal the units of agreement and then 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.510
 And remember the arrow always points 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.239
 towards the smaller number in case we 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.650
 let's fix on this symbol for this guys 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.650
 Well, see you soon
