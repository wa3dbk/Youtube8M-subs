harmonization at the top so if I have at

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.360 
harmonization at the top so if I have at
an<00:01:50.890> interval<00:01:51.310> of<00:01:51.370> a<00:01:51.550> sixth<00:01:52.030> there<00:01:53.160> which<00:01:54.160> it

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
an interval of a sixth there which it

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.520 
an interval of a sixth there which it
means<00:01:54.580> I'm<00:01:54.760> pressing<00:01:55.480> the<00:01:55.630> E<00:01:55.660> and<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.140> sea

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
the D let's go on to the right hand now

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.930 
the D let's go on to the right hand now
and<00:03:13.209> show<00:03:13.450> you<00:03:13.510> what<00:03:13.629> I<00:03:13.659> do<00:03:13.900> that<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:15.610> standard

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
and show you what I do that the standard

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.670 
and show you what I do that the standard
pattern<00:03:16.120> for<00:03:16.360> the<00:03:16.420> right<00:03:16.629> hand<00:03:16.959> it's<00:03:17.379> really

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
pattern for the right hand it's really

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.259 
pattern for the right hand it's really
simple<00:03:17.920> I<00:03:18.250> play<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.269> open<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:19.810> base<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:21.790> I<00:03:21.970> play

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
simple I play the open a base and I play

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.220 
simple I play the open a base and I play
the<00:03:22.569> first<00:03:23.140> and<00:03:23.500> third<00:03:23.920> fingers<00:03:24.250> together

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
the first and third fingers together

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:32.230 
the first and third fingers together
which<00:03:26.230> is<00:03:26.260> I<00:03:26.680> and<00:03:27.069> a<00:03:27.310> few<00:03:27.610> classically<00:03:28.330> trained

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.840 

I<00:03:32.360> then<00:03:33.050> plenty<00:03:33.320> the<00:03:33.800> bass<00:03:33.980> note<00:03:34.280> again<00:03:34.580> but

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
I then plenty the bass note again but

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.480 
I then plenty the bass note again but
play<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.510> tune<00:03:35.750> of<00:03:35.930> separated<00:03:36.710> this<00:03:36.890> time<00:03:37.160> but

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
play the tune of separated this time but

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:45.730 
play the tune of separated this time but
backwards<00:03:39.040> on<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.220> time

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.950 

but<00:03:46.100> faster

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:51.960 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:04:01.150 

add<00:03:52.950> it<00:03:53.160> to<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.400> course

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.180 

let's<00:04:02.030> put<00:04:02.240> the<00:04:02.300> whole<00:04:02.450> thing<00:04:02.660> together<00:04:03.190> this

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
let's put the whole thing together this

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.490 
let's put the whole thing together this
is<00:04:04.340> how<00:04:04.490> it<00:04:04.640> it<00:04:05.300> all<00:04:05.450> comes<00:04:05.660> together<00:04:05.900> just

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
is how it it all comes together just

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.160 
is how it it all comes together just
watch<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.800> timing<00:04:07.220> here<00:04:07.370> on<00:04:07.520> the<00:04:07.640> a<00:04:07.670> and

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
watch the timing here on the a and

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.960 
watch the timing here on the a and
there's<00:04:09.170> a<00:04:09.260> full<00:04:09.500> bar<00:04:09.680> sequence<00:04:10.250> we've<00:04:10.790> got

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
there's a full bar sequence we've got

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.120 
there's a full bar sequence we've got
the<00:04:11.150> first<00:04:11.420> bar<00:04:14.140> the<00:04:15.140> second<00:04:15.590> bar<00:04:15.770> is<00:04:15.920> that

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
the first bar the second bar is that

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.699 
the first bar the second bar is that
variation

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
third bar is to shouts we got there for

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.420 
third bar is to shouts we got there for
half

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
when I play that in concert I usually do

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.270 
when I play that in concert I usually do
it<00:05:31.250> fairly<00:05:31.430> quickly<00:05:31.580> and<00:05:32.150> I<00:05:32.930> put<00:05:33.800> in<00:05:33.889> lots<00:05:34.009> of

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
it fairly quickly and I put in lots of

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.490 
it fairly quickly and I put in lots of
variations<00:05:34.910> all<00:05:35.060> over<00:05:35.090> the<00:05:35.419> place<00:05:35.630> so<00:05:35.930> what

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
variations all over the place so what

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.070 
variations all over the place so what
you've<00:05:36.680> just<00:05:36.710> seen<00:05:37.039> is<00:05:37.100> is<00:05:37.910> the<00:05:38.330> very<00:05:38.509> basic

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
you've just seen is is the very basic
