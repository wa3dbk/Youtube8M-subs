00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
redesigned almost everything in iOS 7 do

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.020 
redesigned almost everything in iOS 7 do
you<00:00:46.469> think<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.010> later<00:00:47.340> they<00:00:47.610> will<00:00:47.730> do<00:00:47.879> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
you think that later they will do the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.900 
you think that later they will do the
same<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.420> OS<00:00:48.750> 10<00:00:49.110> thanks<00:00:50.100> well<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.489> think<00:00:50.730> this

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
same to OS 10 thanks well I think this

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.600 
same to OS 10 thanks well I think this
64-bit<00:00:51.750> architecture<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.620> step<00:00:53.160> toward<00:00:53.460> an

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
64-bit architecture is a step toward an

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.939 
64-bit architecture is a step toward an
arm-based<00:00:54.110> macbook<00:00:55.110> pro<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.680> will<00:00:55.829> be<00:00:55.920> a

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
arm-based macbook pro so this will be a

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.830 
arm-based macbook pro so this will be a
very<00:00:56.129> interesting<00:00:56.250> kind<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.180> next<00:00:57.480> couple<00:00:57.809> of

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
very interesting kind of next couple of

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.040 
very interesting kind of next couple of
years<00:00:57.899> for<00:00:58.620> Apple<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.430> definitely<00:01:00.120> think<00:01:00.899> that

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
years for Apple I definitely think that

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.439 
years for Apple I definitely think that
they<00:01:01.379> are<00:01:01.410> going<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.980> integrate<00:01:02.250> parts<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.059> iOS

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
they are going to integrate parts of iOS

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.509 
they are going to integrate parts of iOS
7<00:01:03.840> into<00:01:04.199> OS<00:01:04.439> 10<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.710> mean<00:01:04.920> we've<00:01:05.040> already<00:01:05.220> kind

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
7 into OS 10 I mean we've already kind

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.730 
7 into OS 10 I mean we've already kind
of<00:01:05.700> seen<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.119> with<00:01:06.390> gestures<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.470> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
of seen that with gestures and the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.780 
of seen that with gestures and the
trackpad<00:01:08.250> still<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> full<00:01:09.439> OS<00:01:10.439> it's<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:11.220> got

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
trackpad still a full OS it's just got

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.020 
trackpad still a full OS it's just got
some<00:01:12.119> shades<00:01:12.930> if<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.830> will<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.040> iOS<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:15.000> I

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
some shades if you will of iOS so I

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.969 
some shades if you will of iOS so I
think<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.509> will<00:01:15.600> definitely<00:01:16.049> be<00:01:16.170> seeing<00:01:16.380> iOS

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
think that will definitely be seeing iOS

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.880 
think that will definitely be seeing iOS

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
think the 5s is a really good device and

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.530 
think the 5s is a really good device and
really<00:03:01.530> on<00:03:01.710> the<00:03:01.830> upgrade<00:03:02.220> cycle<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.790> S<00:03:02.940> models

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
really on the upgrade cycle the S models

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.510 
really on the upgrade cycle the S models
are<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.840> ones<00:03:03.990> you<00:03:04.080> want<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.380> go<00:03:04.500> for<00:03:04.770> for<00:03:05.100> your

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
are the ones you want to go for for your

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.460 
are the ones you want to go for for your
iPhone<00:03:06.150> because<00:03:06.480> really<00:03:06.720> you<00:03:06.960> get<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.170> design

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
iPhone because really you get the design

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.340 
iPhone because really you get the design
change<00:03:07.860> in<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.430> base<00:03:09.030> model<00:03:09.300> so<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.840> five<00:03:10.050> was

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
change in the base model so the five was

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.440 
change in the base model so the five was
a<00:03:10.380> different<00:03:10.770> design<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.580> then<00:03:11.970> you<00:03:12.180> get<00:03:12.330> the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
a different design and then you get the

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.090 
a different design and then you get the
optimization<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.710> sort<00:03:13.890> of<00:03:13.950> little

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
optimization and the sort of little

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.460 
optimization and the sort of little
extra<00:03:14.550> features<00:03:14.880> in<00:03:15.210> the<00:03:15.390> s<00:03:15.540> model<00:03:15.570> so<00:03:16.200> for<00:03:16.410> the

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
extra features in the s model so for the

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.280 
extra features in the s model so for the
forest<00:03:16.800> we<00:03:16.950> had<00:03:17.070> Siri<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.640> in<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.150> 5s<00:03:18.600> we<00:03:18.959> have

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
forest we had Siri and in the 5s we have

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.350 
forest we had Siri and in the 5s we have
fingerprint<00:03:19.920> scanning<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.550> I<00:03:20.820> think<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.120> six

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
fingerprint scanning and I think the six

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.479 
fingerprint scanning and I think the six
will<00:03:21.540> be<00:03:21.660> some<00:03:21.989> kind<00:03:22.170> of<00:03:22.200> design<00:03:22.530> change<00:03:22.890> so<00:03:23.340> I

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
will be some kind of design change so I

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.430 
will be some kind of design change so I
say<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:23.880> 5s<00:03:24.270> you<00:03:24.510> should<00:03:24.690> go<00:03:24.810> do<00:03:25.020> it<00:03:25.050> do<00:03:25.410> it

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
say the 5s you should go do it do it

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.650 
say the 5s you should go do it do it
