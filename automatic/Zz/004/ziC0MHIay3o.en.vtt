00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.929
 link is in the description hello to 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.670
 you voiceover Maxim is a channel 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.139
 good choice and in this issue we 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.990
 look at performance 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.340
 processor a7 d 600 key but with disabled 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.020
 hyper trading technology 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.640
 as a result, we get performance 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.560
 very similar to performance 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.730
 CPU also second generation but 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.679
 already and 5 namely a and 52550 key first 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.969
 I still threw this idea in instagram 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.800
 Igor Frost after the storm 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.620
 separately thank you so much in general 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.180
 I thought why not 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.160
 why not try why not 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.989
 look at how much current on 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.879
 today and the fifth second 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.270
 generations but I can not afford 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.730
 buy 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.289
 real 5 turn off hyper trading in 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.420
 performance principle will be very 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.370
 and very similar way you are now clearly 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.010
 see one of the biggest advantages 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.020
 capture cards, you can safely shoot all 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.699
 going on in bios and it will be 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.800
 look exactly like it looks like 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.840
 the monitor itself you can now 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.869
 watch me turn off hyper trading 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.610
 on asus narrow motherboard saved 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.830
 reboot windows run 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.200
 task manager and as you can see manager 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.729
 tasks sees only four threads let's 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.830
 let's see what it will give us in games 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.869
 We start for gta 5 settings all the same 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.460
 almost as high as possible in the game 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.840
 fourfold anti - aliasing disabled 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.729
 vertical sync is disabled 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.400
 wake up typhon and motion blur 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.530
 the rest is all twisted food video card 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.460
 same as it was in the previous test 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.259
 radeon r9 290x performed by asus and 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.720
 stand the freshest to date 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.430
 the driver for it is 15.7 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.829
 so what we have on frame rate 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.350
 full 7 betrayed at least forty two 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.060
 but occasionally thirty eight frames in 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.950
 second mostly shows held on 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.290
 level 45 50 fps 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.579
 our 7 without hyper trading will call it 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:56.280
 virtual again issues 3235 frames in 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.259
 second sometimes of course and all 40 45 in 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.909
 more simple scenes of them there and over 60 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.320
 frame rate will be off the scale but big 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.600
 part of the time frame rate is held by 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.399
 level 40 or less frames per second and 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.860
 we also all have particularly pronounced 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.929
 problems and sinking at intersections but 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.520
 which is not surprising 7 did the same 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.290
 the only thing now is the processor 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.390
 already loaded 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.459
 here is just below the schedule 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.200
 load the video card you see for yourself 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.969
 plus don't forget it's almost 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.280
 maximum possible settings in the game 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:24.500
 plus remember about the age of the processor 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.900
 you can still remember what is likely 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.459
 envy map drives in gta 5 will be issued 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.530
 a few more frames per second 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.569
 more but this we have another time 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.640
 check now go to the next 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.010
 the game and the shaft is also the maximum 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.319
 settings here is the difference with full 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.239
 seventh is actually imperceptible in some 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.250
 moments there are some kind of micro cutters 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.620
 micro subsidence is very short and 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.180
 but tangible up to 30 with a small frame in 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.310
 second most of the time we 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.680
 we get all the same frame rate from 60 to 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.540
 90 frames per second for the main 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.209
 manifests holding at 70 s 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.310
 small fps and yes just like in gta 5 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.620
 the processor is already loaded to capacity 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.720
 Witcher 3 ultra settings and nvidia 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.819
 hairworks is disabled and in post-processing 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.459
 everything is also screwed out on ultra except for 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.409
 sharp casting and results in principle not 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.139
 different from the previous test keeps 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:14.030
 45 48 frames per second because as we 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:16.699
 Seen in the last test, the game uses 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.129
 only four of the eight available streams 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:22.159
 and to the version of the game with the latest patch 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:23.169
 today it is 107 and finally 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.699
 counter strike global offensive 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.659
 maximum settings normal controls 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:28.129
 I'm testing with bots 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:30.079
 this time is no exception but I 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.879
 put their intellect on passive 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:34.310
 just so that you can safely 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.379
 run up to this I always tested with 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.209
 the most complex bots and that me 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:39.859
 surprised by the intelligence of bots so nehilo 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.079
 It also depends on the frame rate this time. 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:45.079
 I never fell below 230 probably 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.909
 frames per second and yes to me in the comments 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.680
 to the past test prompted several 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.599
 console teams that are worth leading 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.190
 so that the game does not limit the frame rate but 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.900
 these comments appeared after that 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.000
 how the material for this test was recorded 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.620
 so I will consider your wishes in 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.959
 next time, but for now what can 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.729
 make a conclusion yes very playable 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.829
 and if you for some competitive 

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:05.870
 goals with such iron are needed stable 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.419
 300 frames per second I think them there without 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.639
 problems you can endure what settings 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:12.560
 From all this we can conclude before 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:14.359
 second generation a5 processor is still 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.519
 manifest themselves very well and in 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:19.039
 principle, they are enough for any modern 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.320
 The games are the only thing that these processors have 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:23.539
 there is no longer a supply of her life 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.760
 actually coming to an end by and large 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:27.350
 it's not so scary with the account we are all looking for 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.450
 what will play all the games that 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.550
 will come out this year maybe even 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.620
 the next thing that will arise 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.990
 problems if you suddenly want something 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.340
 There you can stream or write without a card 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.500
 capture in this case you are inevitable 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.420
 will encounter a fall in fps after all 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.470
 processor in almost all games is loaded 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.940
 already to the eye 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.920
 on the other hand if you still have 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.040
 there are some kind of processors 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:52.820
 old video card for example there gtx560 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.590
 570 660 but in general, something here out of the fifth and 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.270
 sixth generation video card which is already 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.270
 loaded to capacity in modern 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.590
 games and still give a low fps and you 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.450
 it does not suit then for you there 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.580
 very simple and painless method 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.740
 the upgrade is just to change the video card 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.540
 to a newer one based on what we 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.310
 saw you can say that again the second 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:16.210
 generation without problems will cope with any 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:20.120
 video card radon levels r9 280x 285 or 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:25.690
 gtx 970 for example and when overclocked it can 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:28.100
 handle from radon r9 290x 390 or gtx 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.750
 980 of course for overclocking can 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.430
 need cooling slightly better than 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.080
 boxed but nonetheless it is the most 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.660
 simple painless upgrade option 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.340
 it's better than buying a new motherboard with 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.080
 new processor and then buy again 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.180
 what mediocre video card because 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.400
 not enough money and after two after three 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.830
 years to be in that situation again 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.410
 the processor is still dragging the video card already 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.300
 no in general something like this on this 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.590
 I finish thank you so much for your attention 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.390
