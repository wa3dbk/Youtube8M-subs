00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.480
 hello shop mask handicap 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:11.040
 greets you my hands novelty 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:16.160
 smartphone ulefone 692 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.160
 on an 8-core mtk6592 processor 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:23.789
 previous result was 27000 214 and so 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.250
 now we can watch 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.800
 current consumption of this smartphone when 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.750
 passing 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:35.190
 benchmark antutu for comparison smartphone 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.149
 samsung s4 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.280
 at maximum maximum 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.700
 current consumption during the passage of tests 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.680
 antutu about two and a half miles 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.559
 ampere 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.469
 zero point one hundred seventy milliamps 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.180
 we have screen consumption screen brightness 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.170
 right now withdrawn to the minimum 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.170
 so run the test 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.200
 coming now 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.630
 testing arithmetic operations with 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.630
 whole numbers 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:02.150
 so what is the result of 27,000 341 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:33.860
 so now let's compare samsung 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.860
 galaxy s4 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.639
 so here we have twenty seven thousand 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:45.960
 three hundred forty one groove he has here 27 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:46.500
 1335 but since the antutu test is not very 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.100
 stable 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:56.610
 it depends on the temperature of the smartphone 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:57.690
 sometimes a smartphone at 692 which is the duty room 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.080
 showed 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:03.950
 the result is more than samsung s4 in general 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.389
 their results are absolutely comparable 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.210
 the main advantage we poss 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:11.820
 it is in arithmetic and logic work 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:17.840
 The processor is still 8 cores 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:19.860
 superior to snapdragon 600 and 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.310
 kiss numerically arithmetic with us 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.690
 supremacy goes in one and six 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:30.470
 tenths four thousand seven hundred times 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:30.470
 twenty eight against 2830 families 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.590
 multitasking ozu too much 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:40.410
 the only thing is not clear here it is 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.370
 why the eight-core processor lost 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:45.000
 multitasking 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.590
 quad processor is possible 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.370
 there are some complaints to myself 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.370
 the tester 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.330
 Well, thank you for your attention
