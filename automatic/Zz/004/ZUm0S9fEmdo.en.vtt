00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
an instantaneous transfer of energy so

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.119 
an instantaneous transfer of energy so
you<00:01:03.870> don't<00:01:04.050> see<00:01:04.140> any<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.500> these<00:01:04.589> balls<00:01:04.890> move

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
you don't see any of these balls move

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.880 
you don't see any of these balls move
until<00:01:05.430> they<00:01:05.519> all<00:01:05.550> react<00:01:06.260> and<00:01:07.260> it's<00:01:07.440> it's<00:01:07.680> cool

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
until they all react and it's it's cool

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.530 
until they all react and it's it's cool
to<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.310> though<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.670> one<00:01:08.880> ball<00:01:09.120> which<00:01:09.330> you're

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
to that though the one ball which you're

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.840 
to that though the one ball which you're
hitting<00:01:09.810> head<00:01:10.200> on<00:01:10.409> forward<00:01:11.010> has<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:11.730> much

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
hitting head on forward has so much

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.520 
hitting head on forward has so much
internal<00:01:12.390> dealings<00:01:12.870> with<00:01:13.050> the<00:01:13.140> other<00:01:13.290> balls

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
internal dealings with the other balls

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.260 
internal dealings with the other balls
that<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.130> actually<00:01:14.430> immediately<00:01:14.730> moves

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
that it actually immediately moves

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.570 
that it actually immediately moves
toward<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.050> cue<00:01:16.409> that's<00:01:16.920> why<00:01:17.070> we<00:01:17.159> pay<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.370> much

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
toward the cue that's why we pay so much

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.430 
toward the cue that's why we pay so much
attention<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:18.060> how<00:01:18.479> tight<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.870> rack<00:01:19.050> is<00:01:19.229> to

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
attention to how tight the rack is to

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
attention to how tight the rack is to
make<00:01:19.590> sure<00:01:19.620> all<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.950> balls<00:01:20.130> are<00:01:20.280> frozen

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
make sure all the balls are frozen

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.160 
make sure all the balls are frozen
because<00:01:21.030> if<00:01:21.270> there<00:01:21.420> any<00:01:21.540> gaps<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.050> you

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
because if there any gaps in it you

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.930 
because if there any gaps in it you
don't<00:01:22.290> transfer<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.130> energy<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.820> all<00:01:23.909> the

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
don't transfer the energy is to all the

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.899 
don't transfer the energy is to all the
balls<00:01:24.180> as<00:01:24.600> well<00:01:24.770> so<00:01:25.770> what<00:01:25.950> about<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.310> topspin

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
balls as well so what about this topspin

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.450 
balls as well so what about this topspin
shot<00:01:27.710> don't<00:01:28.710> be<00:01:28.830> curious<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.130> see<00:01:29.310> that

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
shot don't be curious to see that

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.959 
shot don't be curious to see that
actually<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.689> stop<00:01:31.049> spin<00:01:31.530> shot<00:01:31.860> that's<00:01:32.640> well

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:32.969 
actually the stop spin shot that's well

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:36.139 
actually the stop spin shot that's well
named<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:34.020> cue<00:01:34.259> ball<00:01:34.469> hits<00:01:34.790> stops<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:36.060> its

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
named the cue ball hits stops in its

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.770 
named the cue ball hits stops in its
track

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
track

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.050 
track
and<00:01:36.869> spins<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.920> most<00:01:38.399> interesting<00:01:38.880> thing<00:01:39.030> to

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
and spins the most interesting thing to

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.480 
and spins the most interesting thing to
me<00:01:39.180> here<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.630> actually<00:01:40.070> when<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.159> study

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
me here is actually when you study

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.770 
me here is actually when you study
physics<00:01:42.149> you<00:01:42.450> study<00:01:42.689> superposition<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:45.030> you

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
physics you study superposition so you

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.539 
physics you study superposition so you
are<00:01:46.079> putting<00:01:46.289> a<00:01:46.409> lot<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.560> forward<00:01:46.950> momentum<00:01:47.130> in

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
are putting a lot of forward momentum in

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.830 
are putting a lot of forward momentum in
but<00:01:47.729> you're<00:01:47.850> also<00:01:48.000> putting<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.390> lot<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.509> spin

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
but you're also putting a lot of spin

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.109 
but you're also putting a lot of spin
right<00:01:49.469> these<00:01:49.649> balls<00:01:49.890> are<00:01:50.039> the<00:01:50.159> same<00:01:50.369> mass<00:01:50.640> so

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
right these balls are the same mass so

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.459 
right these balls are the same mass so
that<00:01:51.149> forward<00:01:51.570> momentum<00:01:51.689> gets<00:01:52.140> transferred

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
that forward momentum gets transferred

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.319 
that forward momentum gets transferred
into<00:01:52.590> moving<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.070> other<00:01:53.189> one<00:01:53.369> for<00:01:53.579> but<00:01:54.210> that

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
into moving the other one for but that

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.929 
into moving the other one for but that
spin<00:01:54.719> is<00:01:54.990> all<00:01:55.380> that's<00:01:55.530> left<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.490> acts<00:01:56.729> as

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
spin is all that's left and it acts as

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:57.920 
spin is all that's left and it acts as
if<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.180> two<00:01:57.299> things<00:01:57.479> were<00:01:57.570> completely

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
if the two things were completely

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.599 
if the two things were completely
separate<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.619> took<00:01:58.829> care<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.070> one<00:01:59.369> and

00:01:59.599 --> 00:01:59.609 
separate and you took care of one and

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:00.859 
separate and you took care of one and
you<00:01:59.640> left<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.030> other<00:02:00.119> one<00:02:00.240> behind<00:02:00.570> and

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
you left the other one behind and

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.660 
you left the other one behind and
there's<00:02:01.649> like<00:02:01.829> I've<00:02:02.039> never<00:02:02.189> seen<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> better

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
there's like I've never seen a better

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.160 
there's like I've never seen a better
demonstration<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:03.479> how<00:02:03.630> those

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
demonstration of how those

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.800 
demonstration of how those
and<00:02:04.320> those<00:02:04.440> components<00:02:05.010> separate<00:02:05.370> out<00:02:05.810> now

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
and those components separate out now

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.650 
and those components separate out now

spin has a purpose no we're not talking

about post presidential debate spin
let's<00:02:12.810> stick<00:02:13.050> with<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.260> game<00:02:13.380> we<00:02:13.560> actually

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
let's stick with the game we actually

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.330 
let's stick with the game we actually
enjoyed<00:02:14.490> watching<00:02:15.709> ideally<00:02:16.709> I<00:02:16.800> would<00:02:16.980> not

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
enjoyed watching ideally I would not

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.430 
enjoyed watching ideally I would not
want<00:02:17.580> there<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.730> be<00:02:17.880> spin<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.420> would<00:02:19.080> be<00:02:19.200> hoping

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
want there to be spin I would be hoping

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.170 
want there to be spin I would be hoping
I<00:02:19.500> was<00:02:19.620> hitting<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.920> center<00:02:20.130> of<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.370> ball<00:02:20.520> but

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
I was hitting the center of the ball but

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.520 
I was hitting the center of the ball but
sometimes<00:02:21.570> you<00:02:22.050> know<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.230> hit<00:02:22.350> a<00:02:22.380> little

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
sometimes you know you hit a little

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.860 
sometimes you know you hit a little
right<00:02:22.860> or<00:02:22.980> left<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.610> where<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:23.880> want<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.720> go

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
right or left to where you want it to go

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.110 
right or left to where you want it to go
but<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.590> lot<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.160> times<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.520> use<00:02:26.610> that<00:02:26.910> to

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
but a lot of times you use that to

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.120 
but a lot of times you use that to
maneuver<00:02:27.300> around<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.720> table<00:02:28.050> now<00:02:28.560> how<00:02:28.950> about

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
maneuver around the table now how about

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.940 
maneuver around the table now how about
a<00:02:29.190> spin<00:02:29.550> shot<00:02:29.820> in<00:02:30.060> Reverse<00:02:30.450> what<00:02:31.080> Liz<00:02:31.350> calls<00:02:31.680> a

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
a spin shot in Reverse what Liz calls a

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.760 
a spin shot in Reverse what Liz calls a
backspin<00:02:32.700> shot<00:02:33.080> so<00:02:34.080> what's<00:02:34.230> gonna<00:02:34.319> happen<00:02:34.410> I'm

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
backspin shot so what's gonna happen I'm

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.820 
backspin shot so what's gonna happen I'm
gonna<00:02:34.890> hit<00:02:35.819> low<00:02:35.940> on<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.180> cue<00:02:36.330> ball<00:02:36.709> make<00:02:37.709> the

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
gonna hit low on the cue ball make the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.280 
gonna hit low on the cue ball make the
seven<00:02:38.160> draw<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.030> cue<00:02:39.180> ball<00:02:39.239> back<00:02:39.330> okay<00:02:40.230> so

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
seven draw the cue ball back okay so

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.870 
seven draw the cue ball back okay so
you're<00:02:40.560> giving<00:02:40.830> it<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:40.950> spin<00:02:41.160> that's<00:02:41.400> opposite

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
you're giving it a spin that's opposite

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.130 
you're giving it a spin that's opposite
to<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.030> way<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.209> would<00:02:42.300> normally<00:02:42.690> roll<00:02:42.900> it's

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
to the way it would normally roll it's

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.470 
to the way it would normally roll it's
gonna<00:02:43.260> be<00:02:43.440> sliding<00:02:44.010> along<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.489> cloth<00:02:44.700> while

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
gonna be sliding along the cloth while

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.400 
gonna be sliding along the cloth while
spinning<00:02:45.750> backwards<00:02:48.830> very<00:02:49.830> nice<00:02:51.350> time-warped

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
spinning backwards very nice time-warped

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.949 
spinning backwards very nice time-warped
at<00:02:52.530> 2,000<00:02:53.400> frames<00:02:53.670> per<00:02:53.910> second<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.450> looks<00:02:54.720> even

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
at 2,000 frames per second it looks even

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:05.630 
at 2,000 frames per second it looks even
nicer<00:03:02.330> that<00:03:03.330> is<00:03:03.570> a<00:03:03.600> lot<00:03:03.930> of<00:03:04.050> expen<00:03:04.560> oh<00:03:04.800> wow

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
nicer that is a lot of expen oh wow

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.699 
nicer that is a lot of expen oh wow
she's<00:03:06.360> hang<00:03:06.570> there<00:03:06.870> that's<00:03:07.170> cool<00:03:07.410> well<00:03:07.590> you

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
she's hang there that's cool well you

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.890 
she's hang there that's cool well you
definitely<00:03:08.160> get<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.280> how<00:03:08.549> many<00:03:09.000> times<00:03:09.239> it<00:03:09.420> just

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
definitely get a how many times it just

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:20.420 
definitely get a how many times it just
spins<00:03:10.650> there<00:03:13.310> slow<00:03:14.310> it<00:03:14.459> down<00:03:19.310> but<00:03:20.310> that's

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
spins there slow it down but that's

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.699 
spins there slow it down but that's
probably<00:03:21.390> five<00:03:21.660> rotations<00:03:22.200> before<00:03:22.530> it<00:03:22.590> even

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
probably five rotations before it even

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.800 
probably five rotations before it even
goes<00:03:22.860> one<00:03:23.160> ball<00:03:23.459> length<00:03:23.700> back<00:03:24.000> yeah<00:03:24.420> that's

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
goes one ball length back yeah that's

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:25.759 
goes one ball length back yeah that's
pretty<00:03:24.959> cool

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
pretty cool

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.110 
pretty cool
it's<00:03:26.100> a<00:03:26.190> weird<00:03:26.370> as<00:03:26.459> a<00:03:26.489> player<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:26.940> have<00:03:26.970> a

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
it's a weird as a player you have a

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.270 
it's a weird as a player you have a
sense<00:03:27.420> that<00:03:27.690> it's<00:03:27.959> just<00:03:28.200> kind<00:03:28.890> of<00:03:28.950> floating

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
sense that it's just kind of floating

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.949 
sense that it's just kind of floating
there<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.640> stopping<00:03:29.910> before<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.510> spin<00:03:30.750> grabs

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
there and stopping before the spin grabs

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.110 
there and stopping before the spin grabs
but<00:03:31.230> I<00:03:31.260> guess<00:03:31.920> I<00:03:32.040> never<00:03:32.100> would<00:03:32.880> have<00:03:32.910> thought

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
but I guess I never would have thought

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.199 
but I guess I never would have thought
that<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:33.450> was<00:03:33.829> spinning<00:03:34.829> in<00:03:34.980> place<00:03:37.940> liz<00:03:38.940> has

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
that it was spinning in place liz has

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.680 
that it was spinning in place liz has
one<00:03:39.420> more<00:03:39.720> trick<00:03:40.110> on<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.410> tip<00:03:40.590> of<00:03:40.739> her<00:03:40.860> cue

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
one more trick on the tip of her cue

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.539 
one more trick on the tip of her cue
what's<00:03:42.690> gonna<00:03:42.810> happen<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.709> force<00:03:43.980> of<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.370> hit

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
what's gonna happen the force of the hit

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.180 
what's gonna happen the force of the hit
is<00:03:44.730> gonna<00:03:45.000> send<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:45.360> cue<00:03:45.540> ball<00:03:45.750> this<00:03:45.959> way

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
is gonna send the cue ball this way

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.229 
is gonna send the cue ball this way
there's<00:03:47.190> gonna<00:03:47.310> be<00:03:47.489> some<00:03:47.700> backspin<00:03:48.090> on<00:03:48.180> the

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
there's gonna be some backspin on the

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.819 
there's gonna be some backspin on the
ball<00:03:48.360> which<00:03:48.750> is<00:03:48.780> gonna<00:03:49.049> slow<00:03:49.290> it<00:03:49.320> down<00:03:49.440> and

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
ball which is gonna slow it down and

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.740 
ball which is gonna slow it down and
then<00:03:50.640> there's<00:03:50.790> gonna<00:03:50.940> be<00:03:51.120> some<00:03:51.329> right-hand

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
then there's gonna be some right-hand

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.110 
then there's gonna be some right-hand
spin<00:03:51.989> which<00:03:52.860> once<00:03:53.070> it's<00:03:53.250> moving<00:03:53.730> slow<00:03:53.910> enough

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
spin which once it's moving slow enough

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.030 
spin which once it's moving slow enough
is<00:03:54.299> gonna<00:03:54.480> grab<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:55.140> take<00:03:55.440> it<00:03:55.560> back<00:03:55.680> into<00:03:55.860> the

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
is gonna grab and take it back into the

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:03.940 
is gonna grab and take it back into the
night<00:04:00.650> amazing

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.699 

okay<00:04:04.950> we<00:04:05.280> are<00:04:05.459> seriously<00:04:06.150> impressed<00:04:06.709> really

awesome I'm curious to see what happens

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.890 
awesome I'm curious to see what happens
at<00:04:10.019> any<00:04:10.350> speed<00:04:10.799> this<00:04:11.310> is<00:04:11.579> an<00:04:11.850> incredible<00:04:12.599> shot

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
at any speed this is an incredible shot

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.720
