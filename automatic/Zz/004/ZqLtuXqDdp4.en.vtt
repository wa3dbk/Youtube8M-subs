firstly<00:00:20.190> at<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.490> wheels<00:00:20.869> 29<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.020> well<00:00:22.350> known

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
firstly at the wheels 29 is a well known

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.350 
firstly at the wheels 29 is a well known
for<00:00:22.890> just<00:00:23.190> how<00:00:23.460> low<00:00:23.760> their<00:00:24.000> rolling

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
for just how low their rolling

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.540 
for just how low their rolling
resistance<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:25.020> and<00:00:25.260> also<00:00:25.560> their<00:00:25.800> ability<00:00:25.830> to

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
resistance is and also their ability to

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.760 
resistance is and also their ability to
climb<00:00:26.910> over<00:00:27.150> rocks<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.810> roots<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:28.500> sort
