00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.470
 elio guys so that's this name itself 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.960
 find for a little video so that 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:12.960
 is going to be a fall to both things already 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:16.230
 car to the introduction and the tutorial so 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.670
 already the intro orders manager I had 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.980
 said we would release videos and everything 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.260
 per week but it's complicated in this 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.939
 moment because I tell him full of 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.910
 times and every time I justify myself 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.789
 but I can not do otherwise 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.579
 so 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.809
 so I am sometimes obliged 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.170
 weeks I can not make videos 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.640
 because I'm not even in stock g 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.510
 I can not be excited because I have 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.550
 almost no clip and so that's it 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.079
 or so clips I have by ecc and 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.870
 so 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.870
 so that's why we do not go out 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.430
 too many videos right now we're going 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.789
 try to create a gray server mode 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.760
 for yes I hope that already the video 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:04.350
 gray watch you will have liked 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:08.100
 we will do it again so here I have 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.630
 would be precisely to create a server is 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.750
 so we can do something with 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:18.240
 subscribers if any who have it so here's it 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.830
 so if not for pourcel for this video 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.619
 we'll meet for a little tutorial 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.880
 did me personally I saw I saw 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.610
 pictures like that but in English so 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.710
 it's either swan and swan or other 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.289
 youtuber I 'm not seen yet in 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.409
 French or so between current to there 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:38.700
 access so here's where I go 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.050
 try to show you a little 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.549
 trick to climb back in the palm tree not 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:50.209
 easily but you may have 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:54.209
 more chance to climb above than 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:56.009
 that what we understood was 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:58.740
 do you have to tap that door and there that I 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.869
 just type in normally and then you 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.920
 retreat you pull either the door 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.900
 the corner is for you to decide 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.970
 and that's what after as soon as you're 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.009
 above it must be asked some like 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.480
 I had not asked there was no 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.930
 boots and more when I created the party 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.810
 So it's a shit 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:22.170
 So here we have to run everything 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.670
 right towards a 180 and aim on the side 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.410
 the door 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.650
 so that's pretty cool I hope 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.489
 that you will have liked 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:38.040
 so here I am going to let you go 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.810
 do we go I'll put maybe a 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.900
 little killcam that I just got home 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.030
 after precisely in the tree for you 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.459
 show against the cheaters in 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.750
 largo in the tree you can not do 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.800
 great thing unless you do a lot 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.880
 of nsn if you are like me you do 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.560
 almost everything in the air you can not 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.600
 how to say you do not have too much 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.730
 this time what what 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.200
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.870
 and that well you will manage to climb 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:18.030
 in easily so here's go ciao 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:21.739
