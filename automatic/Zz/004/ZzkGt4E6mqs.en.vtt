clean and poured it on it as well I'm
working<00:02:26.609> on<00:02:26.670> this<00:02:26.909> area<00:02:27.359> with<00:02:28.319> my<00:02:29.069> acetone<00:02:29.700> and

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
working on this area with my acetone and

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.720 
working on this area with my acetone and
actually<00:02:31.019> this<00:02:31.200> little<00:02:31.409> pink<00:02:31.680> spot<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.430> was

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
actually this little pink spot it was

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.940 
actually this little pink spot it was
already<00:02:33.209> but<00:02:33.720> as<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:33.989> can<00:02:34.109> see<00:02:34.170> I'm<00:02:34.590> using<00:02:34.650> the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
already but as you can see I'm using the

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.660 
already but as you can see I'm using the
acetone<00:02:35.519> and<00:02:35.819> just<00:02:36.450> pouring<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.439> on<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:38.400> piece

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
acetone and just pouring it on a piece

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.679 
acetone and just pouring it on a piece
and<00:02:39.709> actually<00:02:40.709> scrubbing<00:02:41.219> it<00:02:41.340> away<00:02:41.549> so<00:02:42.510> this

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
and actually scrubbing it away so this

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:44.000 
and actually scrubbing it away so this
is<00:02:42.750> going<00:02:42.959> to<00:02:43.049> be<00:02:43.109> a<00:02:43.139> while<00:02:43.349> because<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.859> red

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
is going to be a while because the red

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.369 
is going to be a while because the red
is<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:44.189> potent<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:44.939> as<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:45.810> can<00:02:45.959> see<00:02:46.019> it's

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
is so potent that as you can see it's

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.990 
is so potent that as you can see it's
coming<00:02:46.620> up<00:02:48.680> so<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:49.829> goes<00:02:49.859> from<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.489> deep<00:02:50.700> red

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
coming up so it goes from that deep red

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.699 
coming up so it goes from that deep red
to<00:02:51.359> a<00:02:51.659> lighter<00:02:52.139> pink<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.799> eventually<00:02:54.139> it<00:02:55.139> will

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
to a lighter pink and eventually it will

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:55.490 
to a lighter pink and eventually it will
all<00:02:55.889> become<00:02:56.099> it's<00:02:56.819> about<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.090> be<00:02:57.150> in<00:02:57.299> fly

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.400 

we've<00:03:56.500> now<00:03:56.739> actually<00:03:56.980> poured<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:58.410> OxiClean

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
we've now actually poured the OxiClean

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.380 
we've now actually poured the OxiClean
solution<00:03:59.950> on<00:04:00.130> here<00:04:00.459> after<00:04:00.820> I<00:04:00.850> was<00:04:01.209> using

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
solution on here after I was using

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.720 
solution on here after I was using
acetone<00:04:01.930> for<00:04:02.350> quite<00:04:03.220> a<00:04:03.250> bit

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
acetone for quite a bit

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.300 
acetone for quite a bit
oh<00:04:03.760> yeah<00:04:04.450> oh<00:04:04.630> yeah<00:04:04.750> here<00:04:05.500> we<00:04:05.530> go<00:04:05.650> here<00:04:06.130> we<00:04:06.160> go

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
oh yeah oh yeah here we go here we go

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:20.360 
oh yeah oh yeah here we go here we go
the<00:04:06.640> middle<00:04:07.800> goes<00:04:08.800> right<00:04:09.190> oh<00:04:16.979> I<00:04:17.979> see

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
the middle goes right oh I see

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.500 
the middle goes right oh I see
and<00:04:21.090> yeah

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.720

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
okay so as you can see i blotted the

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.340 
okay so as you can see i blotted the
area<00:04:28.150> and<00:04:29.460> you<00:04:30.460> still<00:04:30.760> see<00:04:31.000> a<00:04:31.210> little<00:04:32.080> bit<00:04:32.260> of

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
area and you still see a little bit of

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.220 
area and you still see a little bit of
spot<00:04:32.650> so<00:04:32.980> Mountain<00:04:33.610> take<00:04:34.300> some<00:04:34.510> more<00:04:34.600> acetone

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
and then take some more obstacle een and

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.490 
and then take some more obstacle een and
repeat<00:04:42.010> the<00:04:42.130> process<00:04:42.340> until<00:04:42.850> it's<00:04:43.750> all<00:04:43.990> gone

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
repeat the process until it's all gone

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.310
