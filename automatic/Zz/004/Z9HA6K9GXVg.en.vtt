already and what they all have in common

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.080 
already and what they all have in common
i<00:01:06.490> think<00:01:06.790> is<00:01:07.060> this<00:01:07.330> thirst<00:01:07.720> to<00:01:08.259> learn<00:01:08.440> more<00:01:08.770> and

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
i think is this thirst to learn more and

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.649 
i think is this thirst to learn more and
also<00:01:10.090> to<00:01:10.680> really<00:01:11.680> get<00:01:12.640> their<00:01:12.940> lives<00:01:13.180> in<00:01:13.570> a

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
also to really get their lives in a

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:14.999 
also to really get their lives in a
position<00:01:13.960> where<00:01:14.350> they<00:01:14.680> can<00:01:14.740> make<00:01:14.979> a
