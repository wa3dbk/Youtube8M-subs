of<00:00:15.559> hip-hop<00:00:15.769> culture<00:00:16.160> you<00:00:16.670> seem<00:00:16.880> to<00:00:17.030> be

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
of hip-hop culture you seem to be

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.210 
of hip-hop culture you seem to be
speaking<00:00:17.570> as<00:00:17.690> though<00:00:17.870> it<00:00:18.020> affects<00:00:18.350> the<00:00:18.980> black

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
speaking as though it affects the black

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.070 
speaking as though it affects the black
population<00:00:19.490> in<00:00:20.240> a<00:00:20.330> significantly<00:00:20.990> different

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
population in a significantly different

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.800 
population in a significantly different
way<00:00:21.530> than<00:00:21.920> it<00:00:22.040> does<00:00:22.220> other<00:00:22.400> races<00:00:22.910> do<00:00:23.720> you

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
way than it does other races do you

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.450 
way than it does other races do you
think<00:00:24.110> there's<00:00:24.290> an<00:00:24.410> equivalent<00:00:24.830> culture<00:00:25.190> and

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
think there's an equivalent culture and

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.760 
think there's an equivalent culture and
other<00:00:25.670> racial<00:00:25.970> groups<00:00:26.150> I<00:00:26.630> think<00:00:27.470> it<00:00:27.590> does

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770 
other racial groups I think it does

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.240 
other racial groups I think it does
affect<00:00:28.220> blacks<00:00:28.730> differently<00:00:29.570> I<00:00:29.720> think<00:00:30.020> that

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
affect blacks differently I think that

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.190 
affect blacks differently I think that
many<00:00:31.250> cultures<00:00:31.700> have<00:00:31.970> aspects<00:00:32.780> of<00:00:32.989> the

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
many cultures have aspects of the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.069 
many cultures have aspects of the
culture<00:00:33.320> that<00:00:34.510> negatively<00:00:35.510> impact

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
culture that negatively impact

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.960 
culture that negatively impact
individuals<00:00:36.910> you<00:00:37.910> can<00:00:38.090> look<00:00:38.270> at

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
individuals you can look at

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.479 
individuals you can look at
fundamentalist<00:00:41.290> Islamic<00:00:42.290> culture<00:00:42.620> and<00:00:42.920> you

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
fundamentalist Islamic culture and you

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:44.920 
fundamentalist Islamic culture and you
could<00:00:43.610> say<00:00:43.760> that<00:00:43.790> women<00:00:44.090> are<00:00:44.329> being<00:00:44.510> held<00:00:44.720> back

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
could say that women are being held back

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.310 
could say that women are being held back
or<00:00:45.200> that<00:00:45.380> men<00:00:46.040> are<00:00:46.480> not<00:00:47.480> able<00:00:47.540> to<00:00:47.989> realize

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
or that men are not able to realize

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.200 
or that men are not able to realize
themselves<00:00:48.530> in<00:00:48.920> certain<00:00:49.220> ways<00:00:49.250> but<00:00:49.940> i<00:00:49.970> think

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
themselves in certain ways but i think

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.940 
themselves in certain ways but i think
that<00:00:50.270> hip-hop<00:00:51.079> culture<00:00:51.500> and<00:00:51.800> black

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
that hip-hop culture and black

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.950 
that hip-hop culture and black
contemporary<00:00:52.489> black<00:00:52.610> culture<00:00:53.030> is<00:00:53.120> unique<00:00:53.450> in

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
contemporary black culture is unique in

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.130 
contemporary black culture is unique in
a<00:00:54.200> way<00:00:54.230> because<00:00:54.970> the<00:00:55.970> negative<00:00:56.690> aspects<00:00:57.050> of

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
a way because the negative aspects of

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.750 
a way because the negative aspects of
the<00:00:57.260> culture<00:00:57.410> are<00:00:57.649> also<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:58.040> most<00:00:58.070> marketable

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
the culture are also the most marketable

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.810 
the culture are also the most marketable
and<00:00:59.000> commercially<00:00:59.600> successful<00:01:00.579> aspects<00:01:01.579> so

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
and commercially successful aspects so

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.190 
and commercially successful aspects so
you<00:01:01.880> have<00:01:03.460> you<00:01:04.460> have<00:01:04.570> antisocial<00:01:05.570> behaviors

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
you have you have antisocial behaviors

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.870 
you have you have antisocial behaviors
that<00:01:06.350> are<00:01:06.409> being<00:01:06.710> sold<00:01:07.040> to<00:01:07.370> blacks<00:01:07.640> as

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
that are being sold to blacks as

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.300 
that are being sold to blacks as
authentically<00:01:08.720> black<00:01:08.840> behavior<00:01:09.799> and<00:01:10.010> I<00:01:10.040> think

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
authentically black behavior and I think

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.830 
authentically black behavior and I think
that<00:01:10.430> that's<00:01:10.460> uniquely<00:01:10.940> problematic<00:01:11.659> right

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
that that's uniquely problematic right

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.250 
that that's uniquely problematic right
now<00:01:12.909> what<00:01:13.909> is<00:01:14.030> it<00:01:14.180> about<00:01:14.270> hip-hop<00:01:14.630> that<00:01:15.170> you

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
now what is it about hip-hop that you

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.050 
now what is it about hip-hop that you
think<00:01:15.500> is<00:01:15.620> so<00:01:15.830> pernicious<00:01:16.070> in<00:01:16.670> a<00:01:16.729> way<00:01:16.850> that

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
think is so pernicious in a way that

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.580 
think is so pernicious in a way that
things<00:01:17.299> like<00:01:17.540> movies<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:18.290> video<00:01:18.530> games

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
things like movies and video games

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.280 
things like movies and video games
aren't<00:01:19.100> or<00:01:19.460> are<00:01:19.909> all<00:01:20.150> of<00:01:20.330> these<00:01:20.479> things<00:01:20.690> in<00:01:21.080> a

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
aren't or are all of these things in a

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.899 
aren't or are all of these things in a
symbiotic<00:01:21.710> relationship<00:01:22.010> with<00:01:22.729> one<00:01:22.880> another

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
symbiotic relationship with one another

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.390 
symbiotic relationship with one another
I<00:01:23.390> think<00:01:23.900> the<00:01:24.110> hip-hop<00:01:24.470> is<00:01:24.830> different<00:01:25.220> from

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
I think the hip-hop is different from

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.890 
I think the hip-hop is different from
movies<00:01:25.760> and<00:01:25.909> video<00:01:26.090> games<00:01:26.119> the<00:01:26.479> fact<00:01:26.750> that

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
movies and video games the fact that

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.649 
movies and video games the fact that
it's<00:01:27.560> a<00:01:27.710> lifestyle<00:01:28.250> that<00:01:28.430> it's<00:01:28.850> a<00:01:28.940> that<00:01:29.479> is<00:01:29.630> a

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
it's a lifestyle that it's a that is a

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.350 
it's a lifestyle that it's a that is a
that<00:01:30.080> is<00:01:30.140> also<00:01:30.409> a<00:01:30.710> soundtrack<00:01:31.400> to<00:01:31.760> a<00:01:31.790> lifestyle

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
that is also a soundtrack to a lifestyle

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.719 
that is also a soundtrack to a lifestyle
that<00:01:32.450> is<00:01:32.750> a<00:01:32.780> way<00:01:33.080> of<00:01:33.110> moving<00:01:33.890> and<00:01:34.280> being<00:01:34.430> in<00:01:34.640> the

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
that is a way of moving and being in the

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.140 
that is a way of moving and being in the
world<00:01:34.909> makes<00:01:35.540> it<00:01:36.280> quite<00:01:37.280> different<00:01:37.670> from<00:01:37.820> an

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
world makes it quite different from an

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.510 
world makes it quite different from an
isolated<00:01:38.780> event<00:01:38.900> like<00:01:39.350> a<00:01:39.380> movie<00:01:39.860> or<00:01:40.280> a<00:01:40.340> video

isolated event like a movie or a video

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.420 
isolated event like a movie or a video
game<00:01:40.880> that<00:01:41.240> is<00:01:41.450> a<00:01:41.479> rest<00:01:42.140> from<00:01:42.350> real<00:01:42.920> life<00:01:43.010> that

game that is a rest from real life that

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.850 
game that is a rest from real life that

that most african-americans turn to

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:10.449 
that most african-americans turn to
hip-hop<00:02:09.200> because<00:02:09.379> they<00:02:09.830> feel<00:02:10.039> it's<00:02:10.069> a<00:02:10.280> better

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
hip-hop because they feel it's a better

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:11.809 
hip-hop because they feel it's a better
reflection<00:02:10.670> of<00:02:11.150> them<00:02:11.300> then

she and literature are I feel those

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.119 
she and literature are I feel those
books<00:02:13.980> did<00:02:14.430> represent<00:02:15.230> who<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.260> was<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.950> who<00:02:17.069> i

things about hip hop culture in the
contemporary<00:02:23.310> mindset<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.389> if<00:02:24.749> someone

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:25.109 
contemporary mindset is that if someone

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:26.839 
contemporary mindset is that if someone
doesn't<00:02:25.379> look<00:02:25.680> just<00:02:25.920> like<00:02:26.099> you<00:02:26.340> dressed<00:02:26.700> just

significant impact on hip-hop culture is
it<00:03:04.829> simply<00:03:05.069> an<00:03:05.400> issue<00:03:05.579> of<00:03:05.669> replacing<00:03:06.120> one

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:06.449 
it simply an issue of replacing one

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:08.809 
it simply an issue of replacing one
black<00:03:06.719> role<00:03:06.989> model<00:03:07.260> for<00:03:07.290> another<00:03:07.709> or<00:03:07.980> is<00:03:08.669> there

black role model for another or is there

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.569 
black role model for another or is there
a<00:03:08.849> more<00:03:08.909> entrenched<00:03:09.359> problem<00:03:09.870> at<00:03:09.989> work<00:03:10.019> I

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
a more entrenched problem at work I

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.240 
a more entrenched problem at work I
think<00:03:11.579> that<00:03:12.439> it's<00:03:13.439> not<00:03:13.620> so<00:03:13.769> simple<00:03:13.919> as

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
think that it's not so simple as

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.219 
think that it's not so simple as
replacing<00:03:14.549> one<00:03:15.030> role<00:03:15.269> model<00:03:15.569> for<00:03:15.599> another<00:03:15.989> I

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:16.229 
replacing one role model for another I

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:18.439 
replacing one role model for another I
think<00:03:16.259> that<00:03:16.769> the<00:03:17.370> fact<00:03:17.609> that<00:03:17.759> there's<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.060> new

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449 
think that the fact that there's a new

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:20.330 
think that the fact that there's a new
kind<00:03:19.079> of<00:03:19.319> role<00:03:19.470> model<00:03:19.829> that<00:03:20.069> has<00:03:20.189> never

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
kind of role model that has never

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.050 
kind of role model that has never
existed<00:03:20.819> before<00:03:21.419> will<00:03:22.259> start<00:03:23.069> to<00:03:23.250> people

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
existed before will start to people

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.210 
existed before will start to people
start<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:24.299> see<00:03:24.449> the<00:03:24.870> benefits<00:03:25.319> of<00:03:25.439> that<00:03:25.500> 5<00:03:25.889> 10

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220

20 years down the line I don't think

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:30.349 
20 years down the line I don't think
that<00:03:28.650> this<00:03:28.979> has<00:03:29.159> changed<00:03:29.189> to<00:03:29.759> a<00:03:29.790> pop<00:03:29.970> culture
