traditional<00:03:37.579> so<00:03:38.299> a<00:03:39.049> little<00:03:39.500> more<00:03:39.739> old-school

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
traditional so a little more old-school

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.289 
traditional so a little more old-school
vintage<00:03:40.549> vibe<00:03:40.910> we<00:03:41.570> also<00:03:42.640> put<00:03:43.640> on<00:03:43.760> a<00:03:43.790> pick<00:03:44.090> guard

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
vintage vibe we also put on a pick guard

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.270 
vintage vibe we also put on a pick guard
out<00:03:44.630> of<00:03:44.840> aluminum<00:03:45.350> we<00:03:45.470> do<00:03:45.680> a<00:03:45.709> black<00:03:46.010> powder

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
out of aluminum we do a black powder

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.310 
out of aluminum we do a black powder
coat<00:03:46.459> so<00:03:46.700> it<00:03:47.060> looks<00:03:47.239> it<00:03:47.450> might<00:03:47.660> look<00:03:47.810> plastic

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
coat so it looks it might look plastic

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.949 
coat so it looks it might look plastic
from<00:03:48.500> here<00:03:48.799> but<00:03:49.250> it's<00:03:49.400> a<00:03:49.489> solid<00:03:50.329> aluminum<00:03:50.450> it

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
from here but it's a solid aluminum it

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.630 
from here but it's a solid aluminum it
actually<00:03:51.290> changes<00:03:51.829> the<00:03:52.010> tone<00:03:52.220> a<00:03:52.250> little<00:03:52.400> bit

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
actually changes the tone a little bit

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.430 
actually changes the tone a little bit
when<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.239> with<00:03:53.420> the<00:03:53.540> pickups<00:03:53.930> are<00:03:54.079> mounted

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
when the with the pickups are mounted

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.910 
when the with the pickups are mounted
directly<00:03:54.530> on<00:03:54.980> to<00:03:55.190> that<00:03:56.079> you<00:03:57.079> know<00:03:57.260> it<00:03:57.440> is<00:03:57.590> the

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
directly on to that you know it is the

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.569 
directly on to that you know it is the
the<00:03:58.850> nut<00:03:59.420> like<00:03:59.720> graphite<00:04:00.200> or<00:04:00.590> it's<00:04:01.160> not<00:04:01.340> just

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
the nut like graphite or it's not just

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.940 
the nut like graphite or it's not just
cosmetic<00:04:02.239> actually<00:04:02.959> well<00:04:03.200> with<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.530> nut<00:04:03.769> we

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
cosmetic actually well with the nut we

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.670 
cosmetic actually well with the nut we
use<00:04:04.220> graphtec<00:04:04.850> black<00:04:05.359> tusk<00:04:05.720> on<00:04:05.959> almost<00:04:06.470> all<00:04:06.650> of

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
use graphtec black tusk on almost all of

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.849 
use graphtec black tusk on almost all of
our<00:04:06.859> guitars<00:04:07.900> probably<00:04:08.900> in<00:04:09.049> the<00:04:09.230> 70s<00:04:09.709> they

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
our guitars probably in the 70s they

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:11.560 
our guitars probably in the 70s they
would<00:04:10.010> have<00:04:10.100> used<00:04:10.280> a<00:04:10.519> brass<00:04:10.760> nut<00:04:11.120> which<00:04:11.390> was

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
would have used a brass nut which was

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.900 
would have used a brass nut which was
common<00:04:11.930> back<00:04:12.109> then<00:04:12.140> but<00:04:12.530> we<00:04:12.590> that's<00:04:13.549> pretty

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
common back then but we that's pretty

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.819 
common back then but we that's pretty
labor-intensive<00:04:14.269> to<00:04:14.900> do<00:04:15.049> the<00:04:15.200> brass<00:04:15.380> nut<00:04:15.680> so

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
labor-intensive to do the brass nut so

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.560 
labor-intensive to do the brass nut so
we<00:04:15.950> go<00:04:16.070> with<00:04:16.250> the<00:04:16.370> standard<00:04:16.640> graphtec<00:04:17.299> black

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
we go with the standard graphtec black

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.409 
we go with the standard graphtec black
tusk<00:04:17.950> we<00:04:18.950> offer<00:04:19.370> this<00:04:19.700> in<00:04:19.910> two<00:04:20.090> different

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
tusk we offer this in two different

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.020 
tusk we offer this in two different
configurations<00:04:20.570> so<00:04:21.410> you'll<00:04:21.650> see<00:04:22.010> between<00:04:22.880> the

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
configurations so you'll see between the

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.930 
configurations so you'll see between the
two<00:04:23.210> models<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:24.530> one<00:04:24.710> on<00:04:24.860> top<00:04:25.100> the<00:04:25.370> hum<00:04:25.520> single

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
two models the one on top the hum single

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.240 
two models the one on top the hum single
single<00:04:26.360> we<00:04:26.840> use<00:04:27.020> a<00:04:27.050> five-way<00:04:27.590> slider<00:04:27.950> switch

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
single we use a five-way slider switch

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.570 
single we use a five-way slider switch
to<00:04:28.669> go<00:04:29.120> between<00:04:29.330> the<00:04:29.510> pickups<00:04:30.020> on<00:04:30.950> the<00:04:31.190> single

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
to go between the pickups on the single

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.210 
to go between the pickups on the single
single<00:04:31.970> single<00:04:32.660> model<00:04:32.870> we<00:04:33.229> use<00:04:33.500> a<00:04:33.530> 3-way

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
single single model we use a 3-way

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.510 
single single model we use a 3-way
toggle<00:04:34.849> switch<00:04:35.120> and<00:04:35.440> I<00:04:36.440> was<00:04:36.620> just<00:04:36.770> honest<00:04:37.310> are

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
toggle switch and I was just honest are

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.980 
toggle switch and I was just honest are
they<00:04:37.700> like<00:04:37.880> stacked<00:04:38.270> humbucker

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
they like stacked humbucker

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.040 
they like stacked humbucker
split<00:04:39.860> alright<00:04:40.400> we<00:04:40.550> have<00:04:40.759> it<00:04:41.419> has<00:04:41.630> the<00:04:41.870> off

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
split alright we have it has the off

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.800 
split alright we have it has the off
mode<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:43.250> full<00:04:43.460> power<00:04:43.699> mode<00:04:44.030> or<00:04:44.389> the<00:04:44.600> half

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
mode the full power mode or the half

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.960 
mode the full power mode or the half
power<00:04:45.110> mode<00:04:45.470> so<00:04:45.830> in<00:04:46.130> the<00:04:46.220> middle<00:04:46.400> position<00:04:46.639> is

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
power mode so in the middle position is

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.760 
power mode so in the middle position is
gonna<00:04:47.120> be<00:04:47.240> off<00:04:47.419> and<00:04:47.720> you<00:04:47.810> go<00:04:47.930> down<00:04:48.139> you're

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
gonna be off and you go down you're

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.589 
gonna be off and you go down you're
gonna<00:04:48.860> activate<00:04:49.550> this<00:04:49.789> the<00:04:49.970> regular<00:04:50.120> pickup

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:50.599 
gonna activate this the regular pickup

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:53.140 
gonna activate this the regular pickup
if<00:04:50.780> you<00:04:50.870> go<00:04:51.050> back<00:04:51.259> on<00:04:51.289> it<00:04:51.710> you're<00:04:52.130> gonna<00:04:52.250> cut

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
if you go back on it you're gonna cut

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.240 
if you go back on it you're gonna cut
the<00:04:53.270> big<00:04:53.360> saw<00:04:53.509> so<00:04:53.750> it's<00:04:53.990> a<00:04:54.169> are<00:04:54.380> stacked<00:04:54.710> um<00:04:55.069> but

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
the big saw so it's a are stacked um but

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.570 
the big saw so it's a are stacked um but
exactly<00:04:56.240> it's<00:04:56.389> there<00:04:56.810> that<00:04:57.770> well<00:04:57.949> I<00:04:58.190> guess

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
exactly it's there that well I guess

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.670 
exactly it's there that well I guess
stacked<00:04:58.880> its<00:04:59.120> there's<00:04:59.389> there's<00:04:59.810> 4-conductor

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
stacked its there's there's 4-conductor

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.010 
stacked its there's there's 4-conductor
lead<00:05:01.190> coming<00:05:01.520> out<00:05:01.759> so<00:05:01.940> it<00:05:02.060> basically<00:05:02.180> cuts<00:05:02.750> the

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
lead coming out so it basically cuts the

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.390 
lead coming out so it basically cuts the
pickup<00:05:03.590> in<00:05:03.770> half<00:05:04.240> and<00:05:05.240> wide<00:05:06.110> variety<00:05:07.039> of<00:05:07.069> tones

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
pickup in half and wide variety of tones

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.659 
pickup in half and wide variety of tones
on<00:05:07.669> that<00:05:07.880> guitar<00:05:08.210> so<00:05:08.720> we<00:05:08.840> offer<00:05:09.050> the<00:05:09.440> that<00:05:10.310> hum

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
on that guitar so we offer the that hum

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.029 
on that guitar so we offer the that hum
single<00:05:11.150> single<00:05:11.539> or<00:05:11.720> single<00:05:12.110> single<00:05:12.470> single<00:05:12.889> on

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
either one of the woods so there's

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.450 
either one of the woods so there's
basically<00:05:14.990> four<00:05:15.560> different<00:05:15.620> models<00:05:16.310> but

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
basically four different models but

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.339 
basically four different models but
we're<00:05:16.610> displaying<00:05:17.000> two<00:05:17.270> for<00:05:17.990> the<00:05:18.050> show<00:05:18.199> this

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
we're displaying two for the show this

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:18.670 
we're displaying two for the show this

now<00:05:19.340> one<00:05:19.580> thing<00:05:19.610> this<00:05:20.150> is<00:05:20.300> kind<00:05:20.570> of<00:05:20.720> might<00:05:21.380> seem

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
now one thing this is kind of might seem

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.409 
now one thing this is kind of might seem
silly<00:05:21.979> but<00:05:22.130> people<00:05:22.820> might<00:05:23.000> be<00:05:23.090> wondering<00:05:23.210> like

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
silly but people might be wondering like

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.080 
silly but people might be wondering like
why<00:05:24.020> don't<00:05:24.410> they<00:05:24.530> grab<00:05:25.009> it<00:05:25.160> off<00:05:25.280> the<00:05:25.310> wall<00:05:25.639> and

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
why don't they grab it off the wall and

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.659 
why don't they grab it off the wall and
and<00:05:26.330> show<00:05:26.990> us<00:05:27.199> up<00:05:27.380> close<00:05:27.710> or<00:05:27.889> whatever<00:05:28.160> you
