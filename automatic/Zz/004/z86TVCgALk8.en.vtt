00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello everyone and welcome to yes and 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.919
 gamo shadow wounds was originally role-playing 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.260
 the game you know where you throw the dice and 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.200
 trying by all means to convince 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.210
 yourself and others that you elf druid 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.119
 which name is moonlight surrounded 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.220
 5 more 6 same elves with acne in 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.980
 whole face and leftover chilled pizza 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.990
 so all the tengu came out a couple of games on sega 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.880
 mega drive is super nintendo very 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.279
 quality and breakthrough at that time 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.349
 but since the last noticeable gaming 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.780
 project on shadowrun came out twenty years 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.820
 back and board role-playing games never 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.190
 Were not very popular in Russia 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.110
 let's get to shadowrun returns like 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.600
 something completely new to us 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.059
 It seems an unusual world combining 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.280
 in itself fantasy and cyberpunk it means 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.809
 what we have is the street of the future drenched 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.870
 neon light signage 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.059
 hackers and other augmentation but 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.120
 this in this world except people live also 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.399
 elf arches and gnomes besides technology 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.739
 the inhabitants of this world have different 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.290
 the magic of the main character comes a letter from 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.200
 his long-forgotten friend who says 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.570
 it turns out that he had died it was his 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.640
 digital ghost interactive recording 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.280
 which offers our character 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.030
 a tidy sum of money if we take revenge 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.310
 for his death 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.380
 Here is an intriguing start long 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.990
 stories in general plot characters 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.150
 ideology is the most powerful part of the game and 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.330
 you must either know English 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.460
 either the crack in this game is very necessary 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.770
 communicate a lot with characters and read and 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.960
 interact with the world every time 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.040
 when you start a conversation they do not write to you 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.500
 just a dialogue 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.810
 What does the character look like? 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.600
 how he looks at you that creates even 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.670
 certain impression of such a book 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.040
 narrative this is underlined and 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.829
 the lack of voice acting can be argued 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.250
 good or not but data quality 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.930
 texts and indeed dialogues on 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.740
 top level though you are reading a game 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.079
 like a book 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.420
 but undoubtedly a book standing in all 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.060
 books on the most prominent place with the signature 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.640
 best seller naturally as in any 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.879
 role-playing game first you create your 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.560
 character choose gender race 

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:13.100
 pumping specialization is panicked 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.140
 Karma system will not confuse you 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.440
 just skill points for some reason are called 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.670
 feed apparently setting feature 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.770
 accordingly depending on all 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.750
 the above characteristics of your 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.060
 character develops in different ways and 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.880
 story you appear different choices in 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.830
 the dialogues of course the outcome of the story is small 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.960
 what is changing but in these particular 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.880
 small situations are always everything 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.520
 happens in different ways it leads to 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.950
 situations when picking your character on 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.740
 really doesnâ€™t really affect the game itself 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.290
 but it affects your attitude to her you 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.660
 start to play it back in your head 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.940
 the particular character you created and 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.460
 for such wagering there is everything 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.770
 tools, if desired, a solid part 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.870
 battles you can even miss 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.270
 just talking to people but still 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.730
 often have to take up arms 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.310
 the combat system basically copies 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.800
 last year's xcom character takes cover 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.840
 shoot me but she personally 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.300
 it seemed as if it were modified 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.070
 more verified there are no hangers 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.320
 moments when enemies appear from 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.540
 nowhere do you miss 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.430
 one hundred percent chance of hitting and 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.190
 so then you know what I mean 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.500
 well, plus due to the specifics of the setting in 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.840
 you have a lot more opportunities because 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.700
 besides guns you can also use 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.830
 magic drones and various technical 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.260
 chips are the same decker and 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.330
 or more simply, hackers can penetrate 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.730
 into the matrix and for example chop down the enemy 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.020
 turrets well and let's go over the general 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.910
 technical aspects 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.340
 the game was sponsored through 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.120
 kickstarter and budget sticks 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.430
 from everywhere 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.860
 but in no less way drawn and in advance 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.320
 backgrounds look pretty cute 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.660
 art level design characters 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.030
 the animation is of course ugly but overall 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.940
 collectively look tolerant with it 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.250
 it is clear where the developers were aiming the game 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.770
 creates the perfect classic look 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.810
 isometric rpg they even added 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.670
 special level editor which 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.310
 makes it very easy to create your own 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.590
 stories using off-the-shelf tools 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.360
 music is nothing special but she 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.700
 works here exclusively on 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.650
 atmosphere combining all the elements and 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.169
 creating before us leisurely 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.600
 cyberpunk adventures there are a number of very 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.150
 strong cons first problems 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.400
 production 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.250
 activities believe it or not but first 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.470
 This time the game is loaded for 3-4 minutes and 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.870
 then as much again when you create 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.330
 your character just arises 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.250
 reasonable question what the hell 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.229
 during this time you can ten times about 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.810
 ship the whole world and life simulation 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:45.150
 oblivion and skyrim plus combined 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.400
 fps is often lost due to 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.680
 imperfections unpretentious engine but with 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.330
 this all can live most infuriates 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.940
 not the ability to persist in any 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.190
 momentary game by and large linear 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.560
 goes on conditional level and only between 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.210
 You save them and it turns out 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.639
 safe every half hour 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.960
 This is unacceptable in addition to these 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.580
 games often want 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.260
 experiment with dialogue 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.449
 you know will continue before important 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.760
 the conversation will load and try 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:14.699
 replay it differently data system 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.620
 puts an end to this as a result we come 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:18.360
 just one personal question 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.460
 each player's interest 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.070
 do you like this unusual seiting 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.229
 do you like a leisurely atmospheric 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.539
 gameplay flowing through your fingers 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:29.550
 do you like to read a lot of awesome 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:32.340
 quality texts and penetrate deep into 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.860
 stories if yes then shadowrun returns 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.900
 game for you all thank you for your attention with 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.580
 you were a commander and gamma is not 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.800
 forget to subscribe to the channel and 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.229
 write comments your feedback is very 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.870
 important for us because only by him we 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:48.500
 we can make the project better for everyone yet 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.500
 before communication
