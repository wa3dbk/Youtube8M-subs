00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:08.630
 Melee order instruction 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.310
 It has become apart submarine 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.310
 Melee order instruction 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.310
 Hmm 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.080
 Or kick 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.080
 All right 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.140
 pls respond 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.620
 Are you alive 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.640
 Madison is ok 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.640
 Oh, it was good 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:48.170
 But it would not have anymore long because there is no oxygen 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:53.500
 There is a base nearby but I'm sending coordinates 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.500
 It was good and this would help 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.760
 It is good to be ahead of this 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.760
 Let's go for the moment 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.640
 Sea level is far 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.200
 Is that so? 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.770
 I think there is oxygen properly 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.050
 Hmm 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.560
 I will not eat 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.560
 I was pulled out 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.110
 Tsuitazo to the base 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:37.770
 Might be still some things well go likely 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.770
 It is so so 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:51.939
 I'll go back to find a broken submarine 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:51.939
 Turns out is have a safe it from sending a rescue of the ship when you are out to sea level Yoee ah ah ah 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:01.439
 I have a drill 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.439
 Do you try to make only food or various foods ? 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.739
 This is an oxygen cylinder and protective clothing can be made, but there is no material 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.290
 Do you want to explore 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.080
 It seems that something is displayed on the map 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:55.360
 It never hurts to no but do not know whether the mud what to use 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.360
 Have you collected it to some extent and try to go elsewhere 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.160
 Manta or any 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.160
 Huge 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.980
 There is one name 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:15.620
 It This is called phantom's 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.620
 The map is blinking yellow 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.430
 What a great light 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:33.380
 This is a subcar part car 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:39.140
 The yellow blink is where the parts are 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:44.020
 I got nine in total or one now, so the rest is the end 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.020
 I If you do not create a oxygen cylinder to go to far away 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.030
 Stones will come out if you scrape 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.810
 Do what's out Once you cut the damn thing 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.810
 Iron 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:09.200
 I 'm back because I've got less oxygen 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.200
 Let's make other things with collected iron 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.230
 Installation immediately 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.849
 This seems to be able to make a chest or table door 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:34.449
 I wonder if I can hit a knife and a speargarspear here 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:38.319
 First of all I wonder if I will make a safe knife 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:41.490
 I tried to make a knife but which one should I use 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:41.490
 I can send it back 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.240
 Pan 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.240
 It is powdery, but I can not afford it 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.240
 Hmm 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:59.280
 Yup 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:03.120

 Sameda flee Run away Run away 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.960
 Abuna lateral pass to Ya wants 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.510
 I can not climb temper 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.510
 Gilly 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:17.560
 I can make it with an oxygen book soon 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:21.300
 I'm hungry in front of 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:24.560
 Well how do you cook 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.560
 First of all it's a kind of fire 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.110
 And just what and when and when 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:36.039
 This too is not good 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.039
 I have no more than a cut 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.940

 Let's eat good 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:01.110
 The degree of wealth has decreased 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.110
 Let's make an oxygen cylinder 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.729
 At the same time armor 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.620
 Also bandage also 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.370
 Because I came to go into the sea for a long time 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:24.260
 Let's explore 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.260
 It will be night before it 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.720
