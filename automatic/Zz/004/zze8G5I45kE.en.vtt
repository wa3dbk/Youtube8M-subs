Internet also remember that we are
discussing<00:00:13.280> fictional<00:00:14.280> subjects<00:00:14.820> thus<00:00:15.150> they

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
discussing fictional subjects thus they

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
one's gonna focus on the source of

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.280 
one's gonna focus on the source of
Flash's<00:00:38.460> powers<00:00:38.489> which<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.180> actually<00:00:39.510> it's<00:00:40.260> a

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
Flash's powers which is actually it's a

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.259 
Flash's powers which is actually it's a
great<00:00:40.470> time<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.710> do<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:40.980> off<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.699> mid-season

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269 
great time to do it off the mid-season

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:44.090 
great time to do it off the mid-season
finale<00:00:42.720> of<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.079> flash<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.710> know<00:00:43.739> I'm<00:00:43.920> sure<00:00:43.949> a

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
finale of the flash you know I'm sure a

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.860 
finale of the flash you know I'm sure a
lot<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.309> people<00:00:44.399> are<00:00:44.640> curious<00:00:44.850> about<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.780> know

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
lot of people are curious about you know

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.509 
lot of people are curious about you know
how<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.140> works<00:00:46.290> and<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.829> know<00:00:46.949> time<00:00:47.250> travel

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
how it works and you know time travel

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:48.439 
how it works and you know time travel
and<00:00:47.790> all<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:47.940> stuff

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
and all that stuff

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:50.509 
and all that stuff
and<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.870> kind<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.110> goes<00:00:49.230> into<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.739> basically

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
and it kind of goes into that basically

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:52.189 
and it kind of goes into that basically
see<00:00:50.760> force<00:00:51.059> like<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.540> just<00:00:51.600> said<00:00:51.900> a<00:00:51.930> while<00:00:52.170> ago

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
see force like I just said a while ago

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.490 
see force like I just said a while ago
is<00:00:52.589> the<00:00:52.829> source<00:00:53.159> of<00:00:53.370> his<00:00:53.489> SuperSpeed<00:00:54.329> um<00:00:54.510> it's

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
is the source of his SuperSpeed um it's

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.189 
is the source of his SuperSpeed um it's
basically<00:00:55.890> their<00:00:56.159> way<00:00:56.339> of<00:00:56.640> excusing<00:00:57.629> physics

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
basically their way of excusing physics

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.889 
basically their way of excusing physics
to<00:00:58.769> you<00:00:58.980> know<00:00:59.100> put<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.550> very<00:00:59.640> simply<00:00:59.899> but

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
to you know put it very simply but

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.439 
to you know put it very simply but
anyways<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.290> B<00:01:01.500> force<00:01:01.769> according<00:01:02.189> to<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.119> DC

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
anyways this B force according to the DC

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.840 
anyways this B force according to the DC
Comics<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.110> essentially<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.100> multiversal

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
Comics is essentially a multiversal

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.929 
Comics is essentially a multiversal
barrier<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.570> space-time<00:01:07.530> surrounding<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.369> 52

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
barrier of space-time surrounding the 52

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.950 
barrier of space-time surrounding the 52
universes<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.510> make<00:01:09.810> up<00:01:09.960> DC<00:01:10.290> Multiverse

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
universes that make up DC Multiverse

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.999 
universes that make up DC Multiverse
excluding<00:01:12.960> different<00:01:13.409> dimensions

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
excluding different dimensions

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.429 
excluding different dimensions
dimensions<00:01:14.460> exist<00:01:15.270> outside<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:16.049> which<00:01:16.290> is

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
dimensions exist outside of it which is

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.940 
dimensions exist outside of it which is
why<00:01:16.590> certain<00:01:17.340> dimensions<00:01:17.939> like<00:01:18.590> like<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.770> guess

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
why certain dimensions like like I guess

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.260 
why certain dimensions like like I guess
the<00:01:20.070> Marvel<00:01:20.430> Universe<00:01:20.460> ascent<00:01:21.090> is

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
the Marvel Universe ascent is

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.060 
the Marvel Universe ascent is
essentially<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.080> different<00:01:22.320> dimension<00:01:22.650> which

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
essentially a different dimension which

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.440 
essentially a different dimension which
is<00:01:23.100> why<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.340> Speed<00:01:23.610> Force<00:01:23.640> isn't<00:01:24.030> present

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
is why the Speed Force isn't present

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.440 
is why the Speed Force isn't present
there<00:01:24.630> but<00:01:24.979> yeah<00:01:25.979> anyways<00:01:26.640> certain

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
there but yeah anyways certain

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.120 
there but yeah anyways certain
individuals<00:01:27.960> such<00:01:28.170> as<00:01:28.200> Barry<00:01:28.500> Allen<00:01:28.770> are<00:01:28.860> able

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
individuals such as Barry Allen are able

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.429 
individuals such as Barry Allen are able
to<00:01:29.159> channel<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.880> Speed<00:01:30.150> Force<00:01:30.420> through<00:01:31.229> them

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
to channel the Speed Force through them

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.590 
to channel the Speed Force through them
as<00:01:31.619> conduits<00:01:32.130> which<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.579> why<00:01:33.030> how<00:01:33.270> they<00:01:33.480> have

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
as conduits which is why how they have

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.649 
as conduits which is why how they have
these<00:01:33.750> speed<00:01:34.440> related<00:01:34.860> abilities<00:01:35.659> ranging

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
these speed related abilities ranging

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.149 
these speed related abilities ranging
from<00:01:36.780> superhuman<00:01:37.230> speed<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.710> even<00:01:37.950> time

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
from superhuman speed to even time

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.820 
from superhuman speed to even time
travel<00:01:38.640> however<00:01:39.510> the<00:01:40.230> Speed<00:01:40.590> Force

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
travel however the Speed Force

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.350 
travel however the Speed Force
scientifically<00:01:41.520> speaking<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:42.030> actually<00:01:42.330> a

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
scientifically speaking is actually a

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.660 
scientifically speaking is actually a
hundred<00:01:42.600> percent<00:01:42.690> impossible<00:01:43.670> various

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
hundred percent impossible various

hundred percent impossible various
physicists<00:01:45.300> have<00:01:45.690> said<00:01:46.080> before<00:01:46.500> both<00:01:46.800> the

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
physicists have said before both the

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.700 
physicists have said before both the
reticle<00:01:47.220> physicists<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.380> otherwise<00:01:49.380> they've

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
reticle physicists and otherwise they've

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.960 
reticle physicists and otherwise they've
said<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.250> know<00:01:50.370> this<00:01:50.550> is<00:01:50.729> straight-up

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
said you know this is straight-up

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.420 
said you know this is straight-up
 put<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.560> know<00:01:52.680> plain<00:01:53.310> and

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
 put it you know plain and

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.030 
 put it you know plain and
simple<00:01:53.790> speed<00:01:54.600> force<00:01:54.810> can<00:01:55.020> exist<00:01:55.290> either<00:01:55.530> as<00:01:55.800> a

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
simple speed force can exist either as a

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.130 
simple speed force can exist either as a
force<00:01:56.490> or<00:01:56.760> as<00:01:56.940> a<00:01:57.000> type<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.210> energy<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.840> general

force or as a type of energy in general
it<00:01:58.440> just<00:01:58.590> does<00:01:58.770> not<00:01:58.820> make<00:01:59.820> any<00:02:00.060> sense

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
it just does not make any sense

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.300 
it just does not make any sense
scientifically<00:02:01.080> and<00:02:01.350> just<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:02.130> know<00:02:02.250> it

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
scientifically and just you know it

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.020 
scientifically and just you know it
doesn't<00:02:02.460> exist

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
doesn't exist

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.910 
doesn't exist
the<00:02:03.720> flash<00:02:03.870> themself<00:02:04.320> though<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.620> know

is<00:02:36.209> it's<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.450> theoretical<00:02:36.750> particle<00:02:37.290> that

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
is it's a theoretical particle that

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
with what the comics have established

for<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.890> Speed<00:02:41.220> Force<00:02:41.430> because

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
for the Speed Force because

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.479 
for the Speed Force because
the<00:02:42.659> flash<00:02:42.930> with<00:02:43.200> speed<00:02:43.530> force<00:02:43.799> is<00:02:44.040> supposedly

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
the flash with speed force is supposedly

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.239 
the flash with speed force is supposedly
able<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:45.060> run<00:02:46.049> faster<00:02:46.560> than<00:02:46.709> light<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.189> know

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:47.249 
able to run faster than light you know

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:48.349 
able to run faster than light you know
which<00:02:47.370> is<00:02:47.489> how<00:02:47.579> I<00:02:47.609> was<00:02:47.730> able<00:02:47.819> to<00:02:47.969> travel

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
which is how I was able to travel

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.360 
which is how I was able to travel
through<00:02:48.599> time<00:02:48.749> and<00:02:48.810> all<00:02:49.049> that<00:02:49.139> stuff<00:02:49.370> however

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
through time and all that stuff however

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.739 
through time and all that stuff however
there's<00:02:50.579> also<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.939> problem<00:02:51.269> with<00:02:51.389> this<00:02:51.510> um

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:51.749 
there's also the problem with this um

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:54.259 
there's also the problem with this um
being<00:02:52.469> that<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.799> faster<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.430> go<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.790> light

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
being that the faster you go to light

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.619 
being that the faster you go to light
the<00:02:54.749> less<00:02:54.959> mass<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.469> have<00:02:55.499> um<00:02:56.239> tip<00:02:57.239> where<00:02:57.480> like

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
the less mass you have um tip where like

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.720 
the less mass you have um tip where like
by<00:02:58.319> time<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:58.769> pretty<00:02:59.040> much<00:02:59.189> reach<00:02:59.489> a<00:02:59.579> light

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
by time you pretty much reach a light

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.270 
by time you pretty much reach a light
you<00:02:59.909> essentially<00:03:00.329> have<00:03:00.540> no<00:03:00.569> mass<00:03:01.129> don't<00:03:02.129> quote

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
you essentially have no mass don't quote

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.250 
you essentially have no mass don't quote
me<00:03:02.400> on<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.549> read<00:03:02.969> the<00:03:03.060> disclaimer<00:03:03.359> I'm

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
me on that read the disclaimer I'm

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.050 
me on that read the disclaimer I'm
pretty<00:03:04.530> sure<00:03:04.680> I'm<00:03:04.799> accurate<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.609> I'm<00:03:05.700> correct

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
pretty sure I'm accurate and I'm correct

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.240 
pretty sure I'm accurate and I'm correct
about<00:03:06.269> that<00:03:06.859> basically<00:03:07.859> I'm<00:03:07.950> getting<00:03:08.159> out

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
about that basically I'm getting out

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.220 
about that basically I'm getting out
here<00:03:08.430> though<00:03:08.579> is<00:03:08.819> that<00:03:09.030> for<00:03:09.239> him<00:03:09.329> to<00:03:09.540> run<00:03:09.930> at

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
here though is that for him to run at

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.080 
here though is that for him to run at
that<00:03:10.829> speed<00:03:11.189> it<00:03:11.400> would<00:03:11.760> be<00:03:11.819> impossible

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
that speed it would be impossible

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.839 
that speed it would be impossible
because<00:03:12.389> he<00:03:12.870> couldn't<00:03:13.200> be<00:03:13.379> him<00:03:13.590> he's<00:03:13.769> just<00:03:13.859> too

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
because he couldn't be him he's just too

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.550 
because he couldn't be him he's just too
heavy<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.389> you<00:03:15.900> know<00:03:15.959> even<00:03:16.200> when<00:03:16.260> he's<00:03:16.409> moving

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
heavy and you know even when he's moving

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.550 
heavy and you know even when he's moving
that<00:03:16.829> fast<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.310> know<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.579> amount<00:03:17.790> of<00:03:18.560> energy

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
that fast you know the amount of energy

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.770 
that fast you know the amount of energy
he<00:03:19.829> would<00:03:19.980> need<00:03:20.159> I<00:03:20.370> would<00:03:20.969> be<00:03:21.090> insane<00:03:21.449> like<00:03:21.629> you

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
he would need I would be insane like you

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.259 
he would need I would be insane like you
know<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.019> amount<00:03:22.260> they<00:03:22.549> they<00:03:23.549> hit<00:03:23.760> at<00:03:23.879> this<00:03:24.090> on

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
know the amount they they hit at this on

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.300 
know the amount they they hit at this on
the<00:03:24.510> flash<00:03:24.689> TV<00:03:24.900> show<00:03:25.019> and<00:03:25.349> the<00:03:25.530> comics<00:03:25.980> that<00:03:26.189> he

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
the flash TV show and the comics that he

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.789 
the flash TV show and the comics that he
has<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.519> eat<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:26.849> lot<00:03:27.180> um<00:03:27.449> but<00:03:28.439> the<00:03:28.560> amount<00:03:28.769> of

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
has to eat a lot um but the amount of

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.220 
has to eat a lot um but the amount of
foodie<00:03:29.040> to<00:03:29.159> actually<00:03:29.400> have<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.609> eat<00:03:29.849> is<00:03:30.230> so

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
foodie to actually have to eat is so

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.780 
foodie to actually have to eat is so
great<00:03:31.620> he<00:03:31.859> wouldn't<00:03:32.129> be<00:03:32.219> able<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.489> physically

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
great he wouldn't be able to physically

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.520 
great he wouldn't be able to physically
actually<00:03:33.239> keep<00:03:33.480> up<00:03:33.659> with<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:33.989> while<00:03:34.260> running

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
actually keep up with it while running

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.110 
actually keep up with it while running
cuz<00:03:34.709> he'd<00:03:34.859> be<00:03:35.010> having<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.370> eat<00:03:35.549> while<00:03:35.849> running

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
cuz he'd be having to eat while running

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.939 
cuz he'd be having to eat while running
there's<00:03:36.959> no<00:03:37.079> way<00:03:37.169> he'd<00:03:37.319> be<00:03:37.349> able<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.650> do<00:03:37.769> both

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:37.949 
there's no way he'd be able to do both

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:39.740 
there's no way he'd be able to do both
at<00:03:38.129> the<00:03:38.159> same<00:03:38.250> time<00:03:38.459> while<00:03:39.329> also<00:03:39.569> you<00:03:39.659> know

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
at the same time while also you know

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.140 
at the same time while also you know
saving<00:03:40.079> the<00:03:40.109> day<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:40.319> whatnot<00:03:40.819> so<00:03:41.819> this<00:03:41.969> be

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
saving the day and whatnot so this be

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.140 
saving the day and whatnot so this be
force<00:03:42.419> uh<00:03:42.659> in<00:03:43.349> its<00:03:43.530> own<00:03:43.709> in<00:03:44.010> a<00:03:44.579> nutshell<00:03:44.790> it's

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
force uh in its own in a nutshell it's

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.119 
force uh in its own in a nutshell it's
impossible<00:03:45.870> now<00:03:46.079> to<00:03:46.349> talk<00:03:46.829> about<00:03:46.859> it

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
impossible now to talk about it

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.129 
impossible now to talk about it
conceptually<00:03:47.519> in<00:03:48.000> this<00:03:48.180> in<00:03:48.359> the<00:03:48.569> vein<00:03:48.750> of<00:03:48.780> you

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
conceptually in this in the vein of you

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:50.780 
conceptually in this in the vein of you
know<00:03:49.229> how<00:03:49.379> it<00:03:49.530> is<00:03:49.590> in<00:03:49.709> the<00:03:49.769> comics<00:03:50.220> it's

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
know how it is in the comics it's

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.099 
know how it is in the comics it's
actually<00:03:51.030> pretty<00:03:51.209> interesting<00:03:51.419> like<00:03:51.870> I<00:03:51.959> said

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
actually pretty interesting like I said

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.839 
actually pretty interesting like I said
before<00:03:52.229> it's<00:03:52.739> basically<00:03:53.069> a<00:03:53.159> multi<00:03:53.430> versatile

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
before it's basically a multi versatile

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.039 
before it's basically a multi versatile
barrier<00:03:54.319> of<00:03:55.319> space-time<00:03:56.069> which<00:03:56.370> is<00:03:56.549> you<00:03:56.729> know

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
barrier of space-time which is you know

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:58.909 
barrier of space-time which is you know
essentially<00:03:58.049> to<00:03:58.139> put<00:03:58.290> it<00:03:58.379> lightly<00:03:58.500> when

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919 
essentially to put it lightly when

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.039 
essentially to put it lightly when
anyone<00:03:59.489> travels<00:03:59.939> through<00:04:00.090> time<00:04:00.120> in<00:04:00.599> the<00:04:00.720> comic

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
anyone travels through time in the comic

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.020 
anyone travels through time in the comic

so<00:04:18.930> all<00:04:19.199> in<00:04:19.289> all<00:04:19.409> it's<00:04:19.530> it's<00:04:19.620> pretty<00:04:19.949> cool<00:04:20.250> aw

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
so all in all it's it's pretty cool aw

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.520 
so all in all it's it's pretty cool aw
it's<00:04:20.789> a<00:04:20.849> very<00:04:21.060> you<00:04:21.509> know<00:04:21.570> simple<00:04:22.169> thing<00:04:22.349> to

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
it's a very you know simple thing to

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.439 
it's a very you know simple thing to
process<00:04:23.070> if<00:04:23.520> you<00:04:23.669> were<00:04:23.789> to<00:04:23.849> go<00:04:24.000> into<00:04:24.150> this<00:04:24.210> B

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
process if you were to go into this B

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:26.930 
process if you were to go into this B
force<00:04:24.750> you'd<00:04:24.900> see<00:04:25.080> all<00:04:25.289> on<00:04:25.830> depending<00:04:26.820> what

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
force you'd see all on depending what

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.129 
force you'd see all on depending what
you're<00:04:27.030> thinking<00:04:27.389> about<00:04:27.479> you<00:04:27.690> can<00:04:27.810> see<00:04:27.930> all

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
you're thinking about you can see all

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:31.279 
you're thinking about you can see all
moments<00:04:28.650> of<00:04:28.740> time<00:04:29.550> in<00:04:29.940> that<00:04:30.840> thought<00:04:31.110> process

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
moments of time in that thought process

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.159 
moments of time in that thought process
so<00:04:32.130> let's<00:04:32.310> say<00:04:32.370> you're<00:04:32.520> thinking<00:04:32.849> about<00:04:33.169> your

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
so let's say you're thinking about your

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:35.959 
so let's say you're thinking about your
mother<00:04:34.500> or<00:04:35.219> something<00:04:35.370> like<00:04:35.490> that<00:04:35.550> like<00:04:35.820> I'll

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:35.969 
mother or something like that like I'll

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:37.040 
mother or something like that like I'll
say<00:04:36.060> your<00:04:36.210> mother<00:04:36.360> passed<00:04:36.599> away<00:04:36.719> you<00:04:36.870> go<00:04:36.990> to

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
say your mother passed away you go to

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.510 
say your mother passed away you go to
speed<00:04:37.409> first<00:04:37.590> thing<00:04:37.860> about<00:04:37.889> memories<00:04:38.219> of<00:04:38.460> your

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
speed first thing about memories of your

speed first thing about memories of your
mother<00:04:38.729> you<00:04:39.449> can<00:04:39.570> see<00:04:39.719> all<00:04:39.930> moment<00:04:40.289> you<00:04:40.409> would

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
mother you can see all moment you would

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.499 
mother you can see all moment you would
see<00:04:40.680> all<00:04:40.710> moments<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:41.370> time<00:04:41.580> regarding<00:04:42.389> your

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
see all moments and time regarding your

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:44.159 
mother in the Speed Force from various

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:46.879 
mother in the Speed Force from various
you<00:04:44.550> know<00:04:44.610> universes<00:04:45.599> so<00:04:46.289> all<00:04:46.469> in<00:04:46.560> all<00:04:46.620> it's<00:04:46.800> a

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
you know universes so all in all it's a

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.920 
you know universes so all in all it's a
Speed<00:04:47.370> Force<00:04:47.580> as<00:04:47.849> a<00:04:47.909> whole<00:04:48.389> it's<00:04:48.690> a<00:04:48.750> very

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
Speed Force as a whole it's a very

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.320 
Speed Force as a whole it's a very
simple<00:04:49.259> thing<00:04:49.680> um<00:04:49.830> but<00:04:50.669> yet<00:04:50.820> like<00:04:51.000> I<00:04:51.120> said

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
simple thing um but yet like I said

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.420 
simple thing um but yet like I said
various<00:04:51.719> times<00:04:51.960> already<00:04:52.260> it's<00:04:52.979> straight<00:04:53.400> up

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
various times already it's straight up

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.980 
various times already it's straight up
impossible<00:04:54.000> like<00:04:54.120> it's<00:04:54.270> so<00:04:54.389> impossible<00:04:54.690> like

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
impossible like it's so impossible like

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.030 
impossible like it's so impossible like
there's<00:04:55.169> not<00:04:55.260> really

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
there's not really

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.460 
there's not really
much<00:04:56.100> science<00:04:56.580> to<00:04:56.850> it<00:04:57.030> um<00:04:57.180> as<00:04:57.840> much<00:04:58.020> as<00:04:58.170> it<00:04:58.290> is

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
much science to it um as much as it is

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.040 
much science to it um as much as it is
just<00:04:58.830> like<00:04:58.950> a<00:04:59.010> fictional<00:04:59.580> thing<00:05:00.450> they<00:05:00.870> may

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
just like a fictional thing they may

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.350 
just like a fictional thing they may
like<00:05:01.200> I<00:05:01.290> said<00:05:01.500> you<00:05:01.650> know<00:05:01.770> just<00:05:02.250> just

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
like I said you know just just

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.480 
like I said you know just just
to<00:05:03.870> align<00:05:04.050> the<00:05:04.350> five<00:05:04.560> various<00:05:05.010> laws<00:05:05.190> of

to align the five various laws of

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.700 
to align the five various laws of
physics<00:05:06.000> but<00:05:06.720> ya<00:05:06.990> can't<00:05:07.020> blows<00:05:07.500> you<00:05:07.590> guys
