00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.990
 already the straight the new daytona r 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.750
 shows a clear improvement over 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.690
 to the previous version and numerous 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.760
 modifications to the 3-cylinder 675 cc 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.680
 first of all the new measures of 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.870
 bore and stroke made him more 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.290
 quick presses reggini and above all more 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.640
 engraved mini extension also note the 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.960
 timely work of the new exchange 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.520
 electronic version on the version 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.339
 exclusive that they are driving to 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.020
 cartagena in spain under braking system 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.420
 brembo is powerful and perfectly 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.880
 modular and is assisted by an abs 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.040
 present of series really effective also 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.350
 among the curbs just select the 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.270
 how to have a system for yourself 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.369
 does not interfere with the driving of pilots 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.869
 faster but is ready to save the 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.869
 situation in case of poor grip 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.110
 the insertion and then the curves 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.520
 suspensions are well controlled 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.910
 and capable of transmitting a big one 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.110
 feeling also presence disconnections 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.880
 thanks to the important innovations in the 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.780
 cycling shares in the distribution 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.550
 of weights 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.680
 the bike is even faster than the 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.250
 passed to go down and earn 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.170
 speed in direction changes 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.490
 but perhaps most of all it marks a step 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.770
 ahead in balance and in 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.690
 composure that shows in all 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.760
 maneuvering gets a bit better everywhere 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.590
 in short, and still more fun than in 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.270
 past 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.370
 I read defect or rather the only one 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.170
 lack is that of the control of 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.700
 traction that is also spreading 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.700
 in the supersport category
