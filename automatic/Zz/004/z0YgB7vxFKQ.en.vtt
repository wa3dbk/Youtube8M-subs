 told them victory can not be missed 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.610
 our next video today 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.640
 let's do a hairstyle that consists of 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.890
 two knots based on the knots scouts is 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.950
 with one with the horse and they will deserve 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.940
 very good hair I recommend you 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.489
 if they need 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.570
 gel using loose hair 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.420
 to make it easier to pity 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.430
 they are going to take number 1 is they are going to take 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.800
 a piece of the left side 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.829
 we brush them 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.370
 and we will make a loop on the tail 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:07.150
 horse and with his fingers come from behind 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:11.210
 and they take hair and stretch 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:15.229
 again they go back they take the 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.030
 hair and stretches here either short the 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.380
 long hair but what we're going to 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.670
 to do is to take more 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.670
 they moisten again 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.440
 if it is necessary to apply a little gel 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.190
 and again they come back they take the 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.040
 hair and pull 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:39.310
 again they come back they take the 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.140
 hair and stretch 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.229
 again take the hair from the side 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.250
 left and so we're going to do it up 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.250
 down to finish 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.290
 It is a very fast and easy hairstyle 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.870
 based on scout knots as I mentioned 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.820
 and like last week they liked it a lot 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.580
 our spain breide hairstyle is something 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.250
 similarity is like making a cover for 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.670
 the ponytail here ends the 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.520
 option number 1 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.640
 option number 2 would be to take a piece 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.740
 on the left side a small piece of 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.690
 right side 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.690
 similarly moisten very well 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.690
 brush 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.030
 and here what we are going to do is very easy 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.969
 this piece of the right side comes by 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.540
 behind and passes in front of the one 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:39.000
 we have the left side and now the 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.359
 piece that we went behind we're going to 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.959
 look here and we pass the hair and it makes 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:48.390
 knot again the one you have from this 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.130
 side goes back passes in front 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:55.120
 at the left-side 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.630
 we come to look for the return of the hair and 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.630
 we are walking 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.310
 again I will go back 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.310
 in front 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.720
 this type of hairstyle obviously works 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:19.030
 best in long hair 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.030
 or medium hair is also 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.280
 here and I'm done 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.409
 let's put an elastic if you placed it 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.450
 stuck to the last line I have here 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:35.019
 what can happen is that I can 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.000
 continue with the hairstyle because 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:40.599
 here I secured the short hair 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.860
 they brush again and take two more 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.160
 long 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.530
 here I have one 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.830
 and then we can continue to help towards 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.830
 down 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.290
 and here we are finished, I am going to 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.390
 finish but they could continue 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.970
 depending on the length of the hair they could 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.440
 leaving two or three more knots is something very 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.570
 simple but that gives a touch 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.120
 different to the ponytail and very 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.480
 easy to make them enjoy it and even 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.480
 the next
