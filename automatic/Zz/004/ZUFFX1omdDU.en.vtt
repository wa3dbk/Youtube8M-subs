00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.510
 Young room in the exhibition, as well as indeyo salpil until the late Left 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:15.730
 The scene of the accident is close to the D class course 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:18.180
 In that case, you should experiment with the driver's gaze direction and attention. 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.180
 I think. 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:29.279
 I've done a straight line course to compare with the d- class course . 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:33.630
 Experts who have no idea that the mannequin world is hidden in the middle of the course 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:38.680
 I wonder if I can find a mannequin 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:41.830
 On the left side, if there are two, 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:50.140
 Coming to greet the three cases showed distinctly 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:54.930
 The first one on the notebook is a clean South Korean man and the black weather on the side of power 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.930
 Sarang sol woo 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:06.600
 Fashion whether all because the front garlic staring straight course the church is not distributed to 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:09.170
 Now, if the experiment were to have found all the forces, as well as clothes and two minutes Feature 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.170
 I remember 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.799
 So how about a little more complicated course? 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:26.600
 The driver's hand turning the handle becomes busy 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:31.250
 The dubarashi line also naturally concentrates in the direction of the curve. 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:35.570
 This time the drivers would have found the hidden mannequin. 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:43.450
 I did not have a rest. 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:43.450
 The first third king on the second hack the right to land, resources, dressed scanning line chasejeong 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:51.330
 It's just that there's some kind of model. 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.330
 then 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:04.840
 I've seen mannequins, but they're less accurate than straight courses. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.840
 I would have had to concentrate on my surroundings . 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:19.239
 So what about the b-class course, where you have to turn left ? 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:24.550
 The scene where the actual Mr. Woo was accidentally close to the b class course 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:31.209
 The perpetrator leaves the underground parking lot and makes a left turn twice 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:32.380
 I hit the victim I met in the car. Oh, the chair did not see the suspect. 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:39.390
 I did 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:47.840
 If that's true, there might be some experimenters who can not egg mannequins. 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:47.840
 If the front row of disabled persons such as the floor is significantly publicized 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.730
 I use it for nine purposes 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.950
 Would you like to come all the way back to where where 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.890
 Oh Oh Oh 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:04.390
 Oh what era 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.390
 I went to 5 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.720
 Oh , where are the three, four, nine? 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.720
 You see 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:21.739
 3 In general, 10 straight roads, or on the fairway road, 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.400
 The necessary Asian rights are not that wide. 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.390
 But tinge the range of reagents required for drivers not so very itja 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.270
 Wide 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:36.240
 Even in situations where the resistance is large and wide 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:42.840
 Before the experiment the most attention falls on Digg shaped course compared to 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:44.130
 I like to love things around at the beginning of my life, 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.850
 To 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.850
 Some ten 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.630
 That's it. 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:03.709
 When the direction of rotation around the fashionable Bonnie is tilted more to the left Zoe 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:03.709
 Experts who did not know Kim Hess so accurately 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.530
 Arr 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:20.730
 I hardly saw the testers on the right. 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:25.920
 The actual wired outside appeared on the right side of the vehicle that is turning left 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:28.470
 Perhaps the perpetrator was not able to detect the loss in time . 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:33.600
 Still, the question remains. 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:36.110
 When the deputy crossed the victim's body, the perpetrator 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.110
 I mean. 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:45.630
 I'll call DuPont . 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:52.200
 I remarried an accident with a silicon block with a star similar to the human haebwatseupnida 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:56.670
 We've got a SUV like a car, a van and a car. 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:05:00.480
 3 I did not inform the experimenters who were assigned to the two deputies 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:05.480
 Have you sent a stylistic message 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.480
 After a while the car goes over the silicon block.
