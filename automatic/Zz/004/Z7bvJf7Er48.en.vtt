00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
this file to write bump if we click over

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.609 
this file to write bump if we click over
here<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:09.420> can<00:02:09.569> see<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.750> it's<00:02:10.020> transferring

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
here you can see that it's transferring

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.160 
here you can see that it's transferring
the<00:02:10.770> vespa<00:02:11.129> file<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:12.480> it's<00:02:12.690> already<00:02:12.900> complete

the vespa file and it's already complete

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.809 
the vespa file and it's already complete
so<00:02:13.319> it's<00:02:13.440> going<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.620> star

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
so it's going to star

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.339 
so it's going to star
rendering<00:02:14.269> well<00:02:14.599> it's<00:02:14.749> rendering<00:02:14.989> I<00:02:15.079> want<00:02:15.260> to

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
rendering well it's rendering I want to

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.589 
rendering well it's rendering I want to
add<00:02:15.409> something<00:02:15.769> to<00:02:15.950> my<00:02:16.069> scene<00:02:16.370> so<00:02:17.120> maybe<00:02:17.420> I'm

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
add something to my scene so maybe I'm

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
going to add a little building over here

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.920 
going to add a little building over here
and<00:02:24.249> unlike<00:02:25.249> normal<00:02:25.879> normally<00:02:26.719> when<00:02:26.840> you

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
and unlike normal normally when you

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.410 
and unlike normal normally when you
render<00:02:27.109> things<00:02:27.849> you<00:02:28.849> don't<00:02:28.999> have<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.269> wait

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
render things you don't have to wait

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.640 
render things you don't have to wait
until<00:02:29.629> it's<00:02:29.900> finished<00:02:30.049> before<00:02:30.319> you<00:02:30.530> can

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
until it's finished before you can

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.140 
until it's finished before you can
continue<00:02:30.829> working<00:02:31.250> in<00:02:31.400> blender<00:02:31.760> you<00:02:31.790> can<00:02:31.909> do

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
continue working in blender you can do

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.530 
continue working in blender you can do
anything<00:02:33.019> else<00:02:33.290> that<00:02:33.500> you<00:02:33.620> have<00:02:33.739> to<00:02:33.889> go<00:02:34.010> and

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
anything else that you have to go and

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.690 
anything else that you have to go and
complete<00:02:35.540> so<00:02:36.290> we're<00:02:36.439> going<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.680> render<00:02:36.799> that

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
complete so we're going to render that

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.259 
complete so we're going to render that
and<00:02:38.019> I'm<00:02:39.019> making<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.439> terrible<00:02:40.000> building<00:02:41.000> thing

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.330 

and<00:02:44.269> starting<00:02:45.109> to<00:02:45.200> download<00:02:45.590> that<00:02:45.709> file<00:02:45.950> so

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
and starting to download that file so

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.069 
and starting to download that file so
while<00:02:46.549> it's<00:02:46.760> downloading<00:02:49.269> we<00:02:50.269> can<00:02:50.419> work<00:02:50.930> on

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
while it's downloading we can work on

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.929 
while it's downloading we can work on
this<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:51.439> then<00:02:51.590> it'll<00:02:51.919> appear<00:02:52.400> in<00:02:52.579> this

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:52.939 
this and then it'll appear in this

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.569 
this and then it'll appear in this
renders<00:02:53.449> folder<00:02:53.480> over<00:02:54.079> here<00:02:54.319> so<00:02:55.250> i<00:02:55.280> just<00:02:55.310> have

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
renders folder over here so i just have

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.429 
renders folder over here so i just have
some<00:02:55.790> other<00:02:55.909> stuff<00:02:56.389> that<00:02:56.449> I've<00:02:56.780> rendered

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:57.439 
some other stuff that I've rendered

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:59.770 
some other stuff that I've rendered
previously<00:02:58.069> there<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.459> it'll<00:02:59.359> appear<00:02:59.689> as

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
previously there and it'll appear as

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.869 
previously there and it'll appear as
soon<00:02:59.930> as<00:03:00.049> it's<00:03:00.199> done<00:03:00.349> so<00:03:01.069> right<00:03:01.489> now<00:03:01.519> when<00:03:01.790> it

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
soon as it's done so right now when it

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:03.309 
soon as it's done so right now when it
says<00:03:02.030> pumping<00:03:02.419> raise<00:03:02.599> that<00:03:02.840> means<00:03:03.049> that<00:03:03.199> it's

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
says pumping raise that means that it's

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.500 
says pumping raise that means that it's
rendering<00:03:03.709> and<00:03:03.949> then<00:03:04.669> it<00:03:04.790> starts<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:05.150> download

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
rendering and then it starts to download

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.659 
rendering and then it starts to download
the<00:03:05.569> file<00:03:05.780> which<00:03:06.560> only<00:03:06.769> takes<00:03:06.859> a<00:03:07.099> few<00:03:07.129> seconds

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:07.669 
the file which only takes a few seconds

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:10.149 
the file which only takes a few seconds
because<00:03:07.879> it's<00:03:08.120> just<00:03:08.329> an<00:03:08.449> image<00:03:08.719> and<00:03:09.159> then

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 
because it's just an image and then

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.479 
because it's just an image and then
it'll<00:03:10.340> appear<00:03:10.519> in<00:03:10.609> that<00:03:10.699> folder<00:03:12.370> so<00:03:13.370> now<00:03:13.459> i

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
it'll appear in that folder so now i

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.030 
it'll appear in that folder so now i
have<00:03:13.609> my<00:03:14.030> Vespa<00:03:14.629> so<00:03:15.260> while<00:03:15.439> this<00:03:15.590> festival<00:03:15.980> is

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
have my Vespa so while this festival is

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.369 
have my Vespa so while this festival is
rendering<00:03:16.370> I<00:03:16.549> was<00:03:16.639> able<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:16.939> make<00:03:17.930> a<00:03:17.989> very

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 
rendering I was able to make a very

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.080 
rendering I was able to make a very
simple<00:03:18.709> building<00:03:19.159> of<00:03:19.370> course<00:03:19.579> it<00:03:19.729> didn't<00:03:19.909> take

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
simple building of course it didn't take

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.839 
simple building of course it didn't take
very<00:03:20.120> long<00:03:20.389> and<00:03:20.859> now<00:03:21.859> would<00:03:22.040> be<00:03:22.069> able<00:03:22.310> to

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
very long and now would be able to

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.179 
very long and now would be able to
perhaps<00:03:23.239> render<00:03:23.810> it<00:03:23.930> again<00:03:24.319> with<00:03:25.009> this

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:25.189 
perhaps render it again with this

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:27.309 
perhaps render it again with this
building<00:03:25.609> so<00:03:26.120> I<00:03:26.150> just<00:03:26.359> click<00:03:26.629> send<00:03:26.870> or<00:03:26.989> a<00:03:27.079> pump

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
building so I just click send or a pump

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.550 
building so I just click send or a pump
and<00:03:28.449> because<00:03:29.449> it's<00:03:29.599> only<00:03:29.720> sending<00:03:30.169> what<00:03:30.439> I've

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
and because it's only sending what I've

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.830 
and because it's only sending what I've
changed<00:03:30.889> it<00:03:31.220> completes<00:03:31.729> very<00:03:32.030> quickly<00:03:32.299> all<00:03:32.720> it

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
changed it completes very quickly all it

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.390 
changed it completes very quickly all it
had<00:03:32.989> to<00:03:33.139> do<00:03:33.290> is<00:03:33.500> say<00:03:33.530> hey<00:03:33.949> there's<00:03:34.220> a<00:03:34.280> new

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
had to do is say hey there's a new

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.830 
had to do is say hey there's a new
building<00:03:34.790> this<00:03:34.909> is<00:03:35.090> how<00:03:35.209> it<00:03:35.329> looks<00:03:35.509> and<00:03:35.720> all

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
building this is how it looks and all

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.050 
building this is how it looks and all
that<00:03:35.989> stuff<00:03:36.139> and<00:03:36.470> it<00:03:36.889> transfers<00:03:37.310> and<00:03:37.579> renders

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
that stuff and it transfers and renders

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.420 
that stuff and it transfers and renders
again<00:03:38.269> so<00:03:39.169> that's<00:03:39.259> really<00:03:39.470> all<00:03:39.799> there<00:03:39.919> is<00:03:40.099> it

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
again so that's really all there is it

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.210 
again so that's really all there is it
all<00:03:40.609> there<00:03:41.479> is<00:03:41.599> to<00:03:41.780> ray<00:03:41.900> pump<00:03:42.199> it's<00:03:42.409> not<00:03:42.560> this

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
all there is to ray pump it's not this

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.300 
all there is to ray pump it's not this
big<00:03:43.519> fancy<00:03:43.849> thing<00:03:44.299> that<00:03:44.959> you<00:03:45.199> have<00:03:45.229> to<00:03:45.379> you
