00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
know we go I felt like I offensively we

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.530 
know we go I felt like I offensively we
did<00:02:12.010> what<00:02:12.160> we<00:02:12.190> need<00:02:12.430> to<00:02:12.520> do<00:02:12.700> but<00:02:12.940> defensively

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
did what we need to do but defensively

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.450 
did what we need to do but defensively
we<00:02:13.720> did<00:02:15.510> there's<00:02:16.510> really<00:02:17.070> attitude<00:02:18.070> something

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
we did there's really attitude something

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.460 
we did there's really attitude something
that<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.880> other<00:02:18.910> team<00:02:19.270> can<00:02:19.510> take<00:02:20.170> away<00:02:20.440> from

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
that the other team can take away from

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.950 
that the other team can take away from
so<00:02:21.040> is<00:02:21.100> that<00:02:21.130> more<00:02:21.520> disappointing<00:02:22.120> that<00:02:22.270> it

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
so is that more disappointing that it

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.990 
so is that more disappointing that it
would<00:02:23.050> come<00:02:23.230> out<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.440> not<00:02:24.370> having<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.760> nativity

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
would come out and not having a nativity

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.940 
would come out and not having a nativity
so<00:02:25.420> everybody<00:02:26.050> needs<00:02:26.350> everybody<00:02:26.650> should<00:02:26.920> have

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
so everybody needs everybody should have

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.220 
so everybody needs everybody should have
oh<00:02:27.280> yeah<00:02:27.670> that's<00:02:28.330> just<00:02:28.570> something<00:02:28.780> that<00:02:28.990> you

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230
