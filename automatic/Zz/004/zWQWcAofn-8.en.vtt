00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.590
 and the smoke that was observed to several 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.870
 miles around he was aware of 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.820
 a fire of great magnitude the fire 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.599
 came from the company's warehouse 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.969
 transportation 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.099
 Horna one of its buses caught fire to 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.320
 seem the cause was a short circuit in 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.660
 the vehicle the fire threatened with 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.340
 extend to other units but the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.140
 Timely intervention of firefighters 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.170
 avoided major damage 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:30.640
 if the fire has declared that that 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:32.860
 definitely the security team 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.750
 also the company has participated with 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.540
 extinguishers but unfortunately when 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.519
 fire spreads fire extinguishers make 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.010
 or do a little bit because definitely 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:47.920
 there is a lot of temperature what we have to 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:50.620
 to use that water is to average the 8 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.449
 and 30 in the morning this bus was reviewed 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.030
 because at night he would address 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.160
 Huamachuco according to workers 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.170
 fire spread rapidly to the 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.079
 explosion caused one of the 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.149
 offices remain in ashes in addition to the 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.460
 glass broken by the fever 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:08.560
 sinister was registered in this local 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.619
 the block 9 of the avenue nicolÃ¡s de 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.619
 footwell 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.830
 cables saw and doing 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.830
 it came to the government that the hostages 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.620
 as it usually happens the lack of water was 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.390
 another problem with the fire department 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.760
 so they took time to control the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.160
 fire the task was complicated then the 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.320
 fire department only has two 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.080
 operational trucks so if you have 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.409
 another emergency occurred at that time 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:50.159
 they just could not take care of it 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.159
 Caracas 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.170
 have difficulty if we do not have the 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.299
 elements with the right materials 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.960
 units we only have two units 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.960
 if we do not have it 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.750
 or its cisterns imagine us 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.640
 we're 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.430
 always working for in some and god 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.540
 but without them if we did not have them 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.540
 we would stay
