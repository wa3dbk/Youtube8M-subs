00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.930
 ch 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.170
 so here it is 18 hours 25 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:19.180
 Thursday, October 10, 2013 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.930
 18:25 a person accident and so he 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.500
 takes two hours to 1h30 2h to manage the 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.430
 situation and 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.990
 will get me normal this is an incident is 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.399
 not dependent on them 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.490
 cncf that completely paralyzes the traffic 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:39.649
 for one and a half to two hours 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.909
 so which means that despite putting 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:46.159
 on page of rer b more north there is no 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.380
 alternative solution to manage this guy 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.750
 this type of incident ie with 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.770
 load shedding routes that would allow 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:58.420
 traffics to continue during this 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.420
 type of incident 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.870
 just before the strike tomorrow is announced 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.870
 it looks good
