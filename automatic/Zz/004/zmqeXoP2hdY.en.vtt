00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.320
 a little athlete from vw on the road 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.260
 are spain 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.459
 he should do the splits between 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.710
 fitness for everyday use and sporty 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:21.160
 Drive identify three letters 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.500
 he gti from the outside top model shows 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.570
 the new polo gti clearly from the inside 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.370
 committed to the 40-year cult 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:35.280
 especially by the check pattern on the 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:36.969
 sport is also the big ones 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.450
 Round instruments are reminiscent of the past 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.450
 times 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.969
 an important innovation to the immediate 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.440
 Predecessor on request can also here 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.440
 be manually switched again 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.559
 but here on the highway with 100 like 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.059
 should there really be the potential 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.940
 I believe we should 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.470
 times go from race track 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.900
 julia goes to the nearby 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.119
 race track valencia and meets farin 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.430
 structure benjamin he should shine her 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:27.060
 Show how you see the potential of gti 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:30.990
 Of course you can take advantage of the 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.270
 go go race track in Valencia 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.210
 now round as possible 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.140
 I'll show you where to go 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.140
 bit on the tube 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.620
 generally try on a race track 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.090
 we always have the greatest possible radios in 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.100
 to put a curve in that we mean 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.260
 drive a turn always from the outside to you 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.790
 afterwards in the vertex we the 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.920
 we have reached the vertex 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.900
 again the steering 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.909
 Let us back to the roadside 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.100
 one has to carry one quasi with the 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.930
 Centrifugal force from the car when the whole 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.259
 beautiful liquid and ground then designed 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:09.289
 comes relatively fast harmonious flow 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:11.490
 What you should avoid is on 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.890
 to tear handlebars what's called 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.300
 to direct a lot or jerk 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.890
 because whenever we do that 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.940
 the mature little chance his 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.940
 to build leadership 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.069
 others have to 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.030
 let go let roll back to the gas 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.030
 get steering 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.020
 Of course that needs a lot 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.490
 experience and a lot of practice and that's why 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:43.910
 I would now suggest you 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.910
 just sounds good to very good 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.340
 Let's start trying 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.170
 now just the line too 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.530
 meet and then be round by us 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:01.100
 increase the pace with the speed 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:04.420
 So much fun Julia dares her first 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.420
 ride on the race track in valencia 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.990
 back to the gas and steering again 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.620
 Exercise builds the master 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.930
 but something is needed here 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.330
 training that's why we ask someone 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:44.460
 with racing experience whether the polo gti one 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:46.680
 is racing and on the wild ride the 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.600
 latest generation of the gti breaks with 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.760
 The current trend is here 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.610
 no downsizing 400 cubic centimeters 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.420
 more displacement ensure that the engine 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.490
 is 141 kw but still consumed 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.160
 he with the dual-clutch transmission only 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.740
 5.6 liters per 100 kilometers of the price 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.220
 just over 24,000 euros in germany 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.740
 with the sg one can only 250 newton meters 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.780
 put torque on the road 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:15.290
 hand switched, he goes more namely 320th 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.290
 newton meter 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.560
 the sport select and now we have the 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.580
 sports performance by peter link 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.050
 switched on 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.230
 only the vehicle is still a climber 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.280
 gets better come around 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.150
 also the 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.150
 in the left 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.360
 directly 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.650
 what it takes to the other horse is 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.960
 also a bit heavier the left 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.060
 already here secretly 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.919
 that you are a salesman and 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.980
 understeer breathes makes it 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.980
 Not 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.319
 responsible for this is the xds system 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.939
 it pushes the inside wheel to the 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:55.340
 roadway and thus reduces the slip 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:58.389
 additional braking increases the 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.389
 curves performance 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.850
 from the professionals at the border back to 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.600
 julia with her personal 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.600
 international experience 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.550
 We'll take a look at the little runner 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.290
 once from the outside he proudly wears the 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.570
 red stripes the grille itself 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.190
 to the headlights also continues 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.190
 other features underline his 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:44.680
 Sportiness Greens graduation on 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:47.330
 rear roof edge spoiler double pipe exhaust 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:52.430
 and the three coveted letters shows 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:54.320
 for julias conclusion on the 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.450
 Landstraße could tell that the polo 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.620
 gti really power is still 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.750
 this we could do it on the 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.680
 course, of course, right out of it 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.560
 tease 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.419
 the polo gti creates the balance between 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.580
 the normal city ​​car and the 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:10.090
 standard small racing sports car 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.090
 Perfect
