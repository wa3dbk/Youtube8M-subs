bit<00:00:06.150> on<00:00:06.299> the<00:00:06.390> sides<00:00:06.600> to<00:00:06.839> make<00:00:06.930> sure<00:00:07.140> that

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
bit on the sides to make sure that

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.839 
bit on the sides to make sure that
everything<00:00:07.680> is<00:00:07.859> nice<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.130> level<00:00:10.070> so<00:00:11.070> by<00:00:11.219> c81

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
side rising up more than the other I'm

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.700 
side rising up more than the other I'm
going<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.490> just<00:00:14.670> gently<00:00:15.059> push<00:00:15.630> down<00:00:15.870> not<00:00:16.529> too

going to just gently push down not too

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.200 
going to just gently push down not too
hard<00:00:16.920> because<00:00:17.039> otherwise<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.760> lemon<00:00:18.000> curd

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
hard because otherwise the lemon curd

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.740 
hard because otherwise the lemon curd
could<00:00:18.480> flow<00:00:18.930> out<00:00:19.199> of<00:00:19.619> your<00:00:20.250> cake<00:00:20.480> so<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.510> think

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
could flow out of your cake so I think

ways<00:01:33.560> so<00:01:36.860> like<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.009> said<00:01:38.540> in<00:01:39.540> this<00:01:39.659> case<00:01:40.020> excess

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
ways so like I said in this case excess

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.200 
ways so like I said in this case excess
is<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:42.000> good<00:01:42.270> thing<00:01:42.450> lots<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.530> buttercream

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
and this is going to your take the

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.890 
and this is going to your take the
stability<00:01:50.330> it<00:01:50.450> needs<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:51.350> add<00:01:51.590> decorations

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
stability it needs to add decorations

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.510 
stability it needs to add decorations
it's<00:01:53.900> going<00:01:54.170> to<00:01:54.229> be<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:54.650> glue<00:01:54.979> that<00:01:55.010> allows

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
it's going to be the glue that allows

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.290 
it's going to be the glue that allows
you<00:01:55.790> to<00:01:55.850> put<00:01:56.119> fondant<00:01:56.479> on<00:01:56.900> the<00:01:57.020> top<00:01:58.180> if<00:01:59.180> you

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
first instead of using buttercream you

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.199 
first instead of using buttercream you
can<00:02:06.500> use<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.130> knowledge<00:02:07.340> we<00:02:07.550> can<00:02:07.729> go<00:02:07.880> to<00:02:08.060> use

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
can use the knowledge we can go to use

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.150 
can use the knowledge we can go to use
the<00:02:08.479> chocolate<00:02:08.929> ganache<00:02:09.080> or<00:02:09.560> a<00:02:09.679> white

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
the chocolate ganache or a white

the chocolate ganache or a white
chocolate<00:02:10.550> ganache<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:12.700> you<00:02:13.700> can<00:02:13.850> use<00:02:14.000> jam

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
chocolate ganache and you can use jam

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.760 
chocolate ganache and you can use jam
and<00:02:14.720> we<00:02:14.780> will<00:02:14.930> do<00:02:15.050> that<00:02:15.080> I<00:02:16.959> have<00:02:17.959> like<00:02:18.319> this

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
and we will do that I have like this
