00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269 
his dream in the early 80s and actually

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:43.490 
his dream in the early 80s and actually
started<00:00:42.570> with<00:00:42.659> Richard<00:00:42.960> Nixon<00:00:42.989> when<00:00:43.409> he

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
started with Richard Nixon when he

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.149 
started with Richard Nixon when he
wanted<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.239> reduce<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:45.900> this<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.260> something

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:47.159 
wanted to reduce so this is a something

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:48.470 
wanted to reduce so this is a something
that's<00:00:47.370> been<00:00:47.489> people<00:00:48.030> have<00:00:48.120> been<00:00:48.150> thinking

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
that's been people have been thinking

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.049 
that's been people have been thinking
about<00:00:48.510> for<00:00:48.780> some<00:00:48.960> time<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.580> what<00:00:50.580> we're<00:00:50.760> doing

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
about for some time and what we're doing

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.490 
about for some time and what we're doing
now<00:00:51.210> with<00:00:51.479> the<00:00:51.600> conch<00:00:51.809> with<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.110> Senate<00:00:52.409> is

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
now with the conch with the Senate is

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.219 
now with the conch with the Senate is
doing<00:00:52.710> now<00:00:52.830> is<00:00:53.070> hopefully<00:00:54.049> ratifying<00:00:55.049> the

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:55.229 
doing now is hopefully ratifying the

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:57.320 
doing now is hopefully ratifying the
START<00:00:55.619> treaty<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:56.519> the<00:00:56.610> START<00:00:56.879> treaty<00:00:56.939> is<00:00:57.299> a

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
START treaty so the START treaty is a

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.899 
START treaty so the START treaty is a
small<00:00:57.689> reduction<00:00:58.229> in<00:00:58.409> the<00:00:59.010> nuclear<00:00:59.309> arms<00:00:59.640> that

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
small reduction in the nuclear arms that

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.479 
small reduction in the nuclear arms that
we<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.479> Russia<00:01:00.600> have<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.500> modest<00:01:02.040> reduction

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
we in Russia have a modest reduction

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.149 
we in Russia have a modest reduction
over<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:03.150> previous<00:01:03.360> START<00:01:03.780> treaty<00:01:03.839> and<00:01:04.320> you

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
over the previous START treaty and you

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.830 
over the previous START treaty and you
know<00:01:05.250> there's<00:01:05.460> been<00:01:05.720> historically<00:01:06.720> a

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
know there's been historically a

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.690 
know there's been historically a
bipartisan<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:09.650> response<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:11.009> these<00:01:11.310> kind<00:01:11.610> of

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
bipartisan a response to these kind of

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.789 
bipartisan a response to these kind of
arms<00:01:12.060> control<00:01:12.119> treaties<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.049> hopefully

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
arms control treaties and and hopefully

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.130 
arms control treaties and and hopefully
it<00:01:14.130> will<00:01:14.280> be<00:01:14.430> ratified<00:01:14.759> that's<00:01:15.390> because<00:01:15.720> there

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
it will be ratified that's because there

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.050 
it will be ratified that's because there
is<00:01:16.229> no<00:01:16.409> evidence<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.640> government

shape in the shape of a bubble I think

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.139 
shape in the shape of a bubble I think
it's<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.740> fact<00:02:08.100> that<00:02:08.220> it's<00:02:08.399> rare<00:02:08.640> it's<00:02:08.880> it's

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
it's the fact that it's rare it's it's

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.020 
it's the fact that it's rare it's it's
unusual<00:02:09.780> there's<00:02:09.990> only<00:02:10.170> been<00:02:10.350> 11<00:02:10.800> women

back there's been 1,200 men executed in
that<00:02:16.380> time<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:16.980> this<00:02:17.250> is<00:02:17.459> unusual<00:02:17.610> plus<00:02:18.300> people

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
that time so this is unusual plus people

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.930 
that time so this is unusual plus people
relate<00:02:19.830> more<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.600> the<00:02:22.250> defendant<00:02:23.250> if<00:02:23.670> it's<00:02:23.819> a

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
relate more to the defendant if it's a

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.449 
relate more to the defendant if it's a
woman<00:02:24.120> they<00:02:24.510> they<00:02:25.049> see<00:02:25.110> something<00:02:25.709> they<00:02:26.040> see<00:02:26.280> a

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
woman they they see something they see a

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:27.790 
woman they they see something they see a
person<00:02:26.790> rather<00:02:27.239> than

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
person rather than

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.130 
person rather than
a<00:02:27.830> crime<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.850> what<00:02:29.720> should<00:02:29.900> be<00:02:29.930> the

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
a crime and what should be the

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.440 
a crime and what should be the
punishment<00:02:30.320> they<00:02:30.770> start<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.310> think<00:02:31.520> this<00:02:32.270> is<00:02:32.420> a

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
punishment they start to think this is a

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.720 
punishment they start to think this is a
person<00:02:32.990> and<00:02:33.170> so<00:02:33.350> it's<00:02:33.530> harder<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:33.950> execute<00:02:34.370> an

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
person and so it's harder to execute an

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:42.240 
person and so it's harder to execute an
individual's<00:02:35.690> characteristics
