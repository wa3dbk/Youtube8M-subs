00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:06.810
 and then guys who gave you soon starts at 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.400
 channel experience here I'll try to do 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.840
 videos about all the championships logo 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.759
 we thought we heard all the champions soon 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.859
 brother of fast videos and I intend it 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.420
 make a video playing with it later 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.880
 Do you have any idea how the bild will look? 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:29.699
 second and stimulate the first champion 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:31.859
 will be but I clean because only passive 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.020
 every three mass attacks run the 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.270
 your room will be a double attack being 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.270
 that the second will only give 50% damage 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.010
 his attacking but he jumps on 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.800
 enemy can reach up to four 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.020
 friends and may cause damage 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.510
 critical to the units being that troops 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.870
 demonstrated that only 60% of the 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:03.480
 the national basic attacks also reduce 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.320
 the recharge time no second your w 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.820
 meditate 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.340
 but would be standing still over 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.799
 four seconds recovering life and in this 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.299
 time it was a week ago reduced from 50 to 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.310
 70% depending on the level under the CISC 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.530
 Team nothing depends on content you 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:25.740
 lost 1 1% for every 1% of life lost 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.509
 its useful and style but he loves me passively 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.430
 10% Attack Damage 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.860
 This makes it give 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.040
 from 10 to 20% depending on the 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.960
 level of performances that I remind here 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:42.030
 Your part is going to ask this good happened. 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.619
 cared for by health but it would win 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.140
 speed of movement and speed of 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.850
 attack during a 10-second slaughter or 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.740
 assistance makes it possible for all 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.130
 corners of partnership has a flow 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.850
 reduced by 70% and increased 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.850
 four seconds 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.629
 well this combination of romance talents 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.849
 bild is more with much happier said 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.500
 that basically talents well 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.629
 aggressive with a bit of defense to 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.470
 to withstand the devil's monster or 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:21.849
 basic dna and and I are items you have 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.819
 basic but starting with the trinity 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.110
 both do not stop boot and after the world the 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.000
 other items are more sensational 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.000
 depending on game development 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.470
 this second conviction is a little more 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.610
 complicated it is more about you 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.790
 stay longer in your region 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.620
 highlighting the lantern than a pipe 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.390
 its leaves are aimed more towards 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.390
 attack advance to clear the tongue 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.150
 faster and your items i you 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.160
 I wish you could change the mole engine for 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.310
 hammer if you are lazy 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.379
 Kaita and you can also change the sword 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.310
 of the pure jaw king 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:04.299
 if you have a tight one say that they invoke you 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.579
 The pain you can demeat and flash or smart 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.459
 teleport if you focus more on split 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:12.040
 bush backdoor can teleport in a 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.889
 mini or an order close to the tower 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.720
 The Enemy or Monitor may have destroyed 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:19.260
 trying to become a game that is 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.260
 lost 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.049
 the champions that mass is very well 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.480
 against would first ash because of 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.849
 who with his tool can ignore the laurels 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.030
 and yours and taking care to 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:37.510
 do not take health gear as it taboo him 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.599
 can go through your w100 take slow and 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.459
 they arrived very fast he hilux because he 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.069
 can easily divert this barrier 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:48.430
 with this was the traditional ignore the 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.380
 others me and some champions but he has 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.260
 What do you think about before you go up? 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.030
 first jacques because yours and blocks 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.609
 every Basque attack and then return 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.340
 way this is practically all 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:02.400
 impossible one would be solar jackson x 1 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.579
 unless it is well given 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.260
 according to branches because his caregiver branches 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.900
 works with a thorn armor 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.360
 besides giving it a magical existence and 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.799
 armor and he can run so fast 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.400
 how much you 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.900
 Third yes because the first 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.370
 levels of lessing is very strong then 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.800
 he can try to invade only from hangu and 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.710
 try to kill a few times before 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.880
 you start to get strong 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.490
 guys that's earned for attending 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.639
