this<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.149> perfect<00:00:42.510> for<00:00:42.570> my<00:00:42.780> hair<00:00:43.020> because

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
this this is perfect for my hair because

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.979 
this this is perfect for my hair because
it<00:00:44.430> really<00:00:44.670> helps<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.000> tone<00:00:45.239> down<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.570> frizzy

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
it really helps to tone down that frizzy

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.150

nature<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.980> my<00:00:47.160> hair<00:00:47.460> naturally<00:00:48.059> has<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.600> oil

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
nature that my hair naturally has is oil

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.380 
nature that my hair naturally has is oil
because<00:00:50.160> there's<00:00:50.309> an<00:00:50.399> oil<00:00:50.520> life<00:00:50.850> obviously<00:00:51.300> it

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
because there's an oil life obviously it

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.880 
because there's an oil life obviously it
feels<00:00:51.570> oily<00:00:51.809> in<00:00:52.050> your<00:00:52.170> hand<00:00:52.350> when<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.590> pump<00:00:52.770> it

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
out but honestly that does not

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.529
