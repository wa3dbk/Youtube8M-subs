that<00:00:33.340> way<00:00:33.520> I<00:00:35.190> meant<00:00:36.190> to<00:00:36.489> do<00:00:36.640> that<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.989> was<00:00:38.170> an

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
that way I meant to do that that was an

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.049 
that way I meant to do that that was an
example<00:00:38.440> of<00:00:38.920> exactly<00:00:39.640> what<00:00:40.300> not<00:00:40.600> to<00:00:40.629> do<00:00:40.989> when

you<00:00:43.059> play<00:00:43.270> leave<00:00:43.510> that's<00:00:44.260> everyone

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:56.970 

step<00:00:48.280> number<00:00:48.580> two<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:53.170> not<00:00:53.380> die<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:56.680> you<00:00:56.800> do

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
step number two is to not die and you do

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.360 
step number two is to not die and you do
this<00:00:57.250> primarily<00:00:58.210> by<00:00:59.170> relying<00:00:59.650> on<00:01:00.010> other

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
this primarily by relying on other

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.490 
this primarily by relying on other
teammates<00:01:00.910> who<00:01:01.420> can<00:01:01.660> carry<00:01:01.960> you<00:01:02.230> into

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
teammates who can carry you into

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.610 
teammates who can carry you into
victories<00:01:03.330> failing<00:01:04.330> that<00:01:04.360> you<00:01:05.140> run<00:01:05.380> your

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.620 
victories failing that you run your

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.010 
victories failing that you run your
balls<00:01:05.830> off<00:01:06.100> um<00:01:06.730> like<00:01:07.390> I<00:01:07.630> do<00:01:08.580> frequently<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.960> you

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
balls off um like I do frequently so you

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.100 
balls off um like I do frequently so you
put<00:01:11.440> down<00:01:11.650> this<00:01:12.190> thing<00:01:12.520> and<00:01:12.910> that<00:01:13.510> slows<00:01:13.900> your

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
put down this thing and that slows your

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.460 
put down this thing and that slows your
enemies<00:01:14.560> into<00:01:14.770> their<00:01:14.980> down<00:01:15.190> and<00:01:15.550> then<00:01:16.240> you<00:01:17.200> run

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
enemies into their down and then you run

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.470 
enemies into their down and then you run
screaming<00:01:17.980> and<00:01:18.280> yelling<00:01:18.430> from<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.090> field<00:01:19.330> of

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.480 
screaming and yelling from the field of

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.510 
screaming and yelling from the field of
battle<00:01:20.280> um<00:01:22.140> sometimes<00:01:23.140> you<00:01:23.680> get<00:01:23.890> a<00:01:23.950> champion

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
battle um sometimes you get a champion

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.940 
battle um sometimes you get a champion
that<00:01:24.550> doesn't<00:01:24.970> have<00:01:25.150> a<00:01:25.390> good<00:01:25.570> escape<00:01:25.660> mm<00:01:26.350> and

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
that doesn't have a good escape mm and

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.370 
that doesn't have a good escape mm and
that's<00:01:27.190> where<00:01:27.430> you<00:01:27.460> just<00:01:27.700> kind<00:01:27.880> of<00:01:28.110> stop<00:01:29.110> and

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
that's where you just kind of stop and

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.170 
that's where you just kind of stop and
cry<00:01:30.220> til<00:01:31.210> death<00:01:31.450> comes<00:01:32.580> hopefully<00:01:33.580> it<00:01:34.030> is

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
cry til death comes hopefully it is

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:42.109 
cry til death comes hopefully it is
Swift<00:01:35.430> sometimes<00:01:36.430> it's<00:01:36.640> not<00:01:37.140> either<00:01:38.140> way<00:01:39.960> um

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
Swift sometimes it's not either way um

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.950 
Swift sometimes it's not either way um
step<00:01:43.119> number<00:01:43.300> three<00:01:43.780> is<00:01:45.360> gotta<00:01:46.360> learn<00:01:46.720> your

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
step number three is gotta learn your

it is to kind of to read the stats on
the<00:02:26.590> champion<00:02:27.340> you're<00:02:27.519> playing<00:02:27.760> for<00:02:28.120> instance

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
if you have a shooty champion like

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.850 
if you have a shooty champion like
graves<00:02:31.769> um<00:02:33.569> I'm<00:02:34.569> talking<00:02:35.170> about<00:02:35.379> how<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.650> play

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
graves um I'm talking about how to play

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.920 
graves um I'm talking about how to play
league<00:02:36.130> of<00:02:36.160> legends

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.789 

so<00:02:40.890> if<00:02:41.340> you<00:02:41.700> are<00:02:42.209> playing<00:02:42.599> a<00:02:43.019> champion<00:02:43.560> that

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
so if you are playing a champion that

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:49.280 
so if you are playing a champion that
needs<00:02:45.739> lots<00:02:46.739> of<00:02:46.920> attack<00:02:47.430> damage<00:02:47.989> because<00:02:48.989> he

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
needs lots of attack damage because he

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.849 
needs lots of attack damage because he
shoots<00:02:49.590> things<00:02:50.870> it's<00:02:51.870> probably<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.500> good<00:02:52.739> idea

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
shoots things it's probably a good idea

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.729 
shoots things it's probably a good idea
if<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.489> buy<00:02:53.700> items<00:02:53.969> that<00:02:54.659> also<00:02:55.079> have<00:02:55.290> attacked

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
if you buy items that also have attacked

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:06.679 
if you buy items that also have attacked
image<00:03:03.590> sometimes<00:03:04.590> I<00:03:04.920> like<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.370> Yolo<00:03:05.939> and<00:03:06.239> just

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:06.689 
image sometimes I like to Yolo and just

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.379 
image sometimes I like to Yolo and just
build<00:03:06.870> pretty<00:03:07.379> things<00:03:07.680> which<00:03:08.609> doesn't<00:03:09.299> really

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
build pretty things which doesn't really

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.470
