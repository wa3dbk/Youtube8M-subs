Hi, it’s Sprig Barton
And I’m going to show you how to make a

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.310
really quick and easy
Furniture polish or wood polish

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.050
Out of olive oil and lemon juice

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.280
It doesn’t even have to be exact measurements 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.730
It’s like 2 parts oil
You could actually just try oil if you felt

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.600
like it
2 parts oil

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.840
One part lemon juice
I’m mixing it up into an emulsion

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.160
Because oil and citron juice do not really
easily mix

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.370
So I’ve got an emulsion, let’s try it
out

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.579
On the spot on the hardwood floor
Alright, I’ve got a tired looking floor

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.359
there
And there’s even some worn spots

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:03.760
There’s a really worn spot right there.
And looks like something at one time

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.250
Maybe somebody has spilled water or something
I’m just going to rub the olive oil lemon

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.590
juice mixture
into it

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.640
and it’s soaking it up
You’ve got to be careful when you do this

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.049
Test an area first
Because it might just soak it all up

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.810
Look like a really extra dark spot
Instead of blending in

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.460
So test it first
And I’m doing the whole area in front of

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.460
My doorway here because that was really worn
out

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.060
And it looks much better
Oh yeah it does

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.829
Yes, hello.
And just keep rubbing it in.

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:43.829
And it will keep soaking it up
Try not to get it on your rug

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.299
And ive got an old towel
Im using to buff it up

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:54.299
That helps to get rid of the excess oil
And makes it look even more shiny

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.469
Thanks for watching me make a quick wood polish

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:06.969
