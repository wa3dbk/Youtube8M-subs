00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
end of the line and push it through that

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.570 
end of the line and push it through that
hole<00:01:23.420> that's<00:01:24.290> formed<00:01:24.830> by<00:01:24.980> the<00:01:25.040> bottom<00:01:25.490> of

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
hole that's formed by the bottom of

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.820 
hole that's formed by the bottom of
those<00:01:25.700> loops<00:01:26.050> so<00:01:27.050> you<00:01:27.140> just<00:01:27.290> need<00:01:27.410> to<00:01:27.530> open<00:01:27.560> it

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
those loops so you just need to open it

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.140 
those loops so you just need to open it
up<00:01:27.950> a<00:01:28.010> little<00:01:28.100> bit<00:01:28.310> push<00:01:28.610> it<00:01:28.760> through<00:01:28.910> with

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150
