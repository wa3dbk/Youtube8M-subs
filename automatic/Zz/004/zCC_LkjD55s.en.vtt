00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.230
 Hello everyone, I'm glad to see you on my own 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.390
 channel and today I want to tell you about 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.340
 some funds continue 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.340
 test faberlik care products 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.940
 for a means inexpensive but very 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.100
 quality is very cool and i do 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.380
 already a few videos about me 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.020
 like different smells in the media 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.600
 I couldn't take care of myself this time 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.910
 pass by new smells from the catalog and 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:32.120
 I ordered myself first such a gel 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.760
 confiture for the shower and 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.920
 body sorbet lemon monpasier cream 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.829
 these remedies with divine simply 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.200
 the smell of lemon caramel and in general 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.270
 lemon flavor it is very healthy because 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.129
 that he calms the nervous system 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.680
 tones up concentration 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.020
 attention lemon is a wonderful remedy 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.149
 lemon scent is an excellent remedy for 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.360
 fighting depression for positive 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.760
 emotions and 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.530
 the gel is thick enough that is the quality 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.210
 he basically liked me 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.450
 arranged especially for ridiculous money 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.760
 which he stands and cream sorbet for the body 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.580
 i use it also for the whole body 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.710
 after which one smells just like that 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.600
 here are divine again repeat the smell 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.750
 This lemon caramel is very 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.180
 nice and if you like me like 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.000
 Here I advise you to buy such flavors 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.140
 also I continued testing the tool 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.829
 this is nerd 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.880
 I purchased 2 shampoos 1 shampoo shine and 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.710
 silky 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.140
 shampoo and moisturizing nutritional protection and 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.150
 balm shine and silkiness let's start with 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.280
 shampoo I always said that I have a lot 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.079
 in principle, no shampoo is expected for me 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.350
 the most important thing is to shampoo well 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.600
 washed the goal well washed the hair and 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.479
 this 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.000
 the effect of the washed hair he kept 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.340
 long enough remember that if you choose 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.320
 of these two means of chain the task is better 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.240
 copes here this here blue 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.090
 shampoo from on nerd moisturizing 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.210
 nutritional protection with blue lotus berries 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.179
 goji and amaranth oil both means 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.180
 Smell very nice including here 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.459
 this balm balm I would not say 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.560
 what's some outstanding something 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:19.760
 different it's just not bad means 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.030
 for everyday care if you are each 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.340
 day 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.590
 end this hair or every other day 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.640
 for example after balm and form them 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.100
 I use my hair well 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.989
 combed to not have hair 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.060
 matted against shampoo and balm 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.810
 this task quite cope continue 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.950
 your story and tell you about 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.720
 creams 2 day and night 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.390
 recovery correction and matting 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.610
 moisturizing this series is airstream 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.100
 I previously bought cream effort 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.390
 airstream if I can find a reference 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.549
 there it is in the description of the video 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.820
 last time the quality is nice 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.980
 surprised this time the same thing i can 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.940
 say that the cream is soft enough 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.970
 good moisturizing nice non sticky I'm 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.890
 they would put on a five-point scale of 5 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.930
 with a big fat plus since 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.079
 Value for money here of course 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.690
 on high cream and thick enough on 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:21.290
 my opinion they fit very well 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:23.600
 dry skin, dehydrated skin is possible 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.030
 even the skin is already prone to some 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.859
 first age changes like 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.130
 relies several day cream 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:32.930
 easier than night 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.820
 cream is absorbed quickly enough and 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.329
 I use them now 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.760
 active, that is, here it is 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:43.910
 These here 2 kremchik and just in my opinion 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.340
 very super and also two more 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.230
 funds left 1 what she wanted 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.480
 tell it that I took away from my husband 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.680
 I first bought him foam for a comfortable 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.610
 shaving but looking at the standing here and decided 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.650
 are using 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.990
 I myself, of course, foam is of course very 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.020
 I liked very much that the faberlic 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:06.530
 no foam for same as shaving 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.390
 shaving foam for women here but 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.240
 In principle, I think some kind of soup 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:14.810
 there is no difference with a very pleasant smell 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:17.359
 its all functions cope this 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.640
 the foam is just wonderful and last 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.460
 The tool that I want to tell you is 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.220
 very cool tool / indra this 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.950
 instant drying for varnish in it 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:31.490
 interesting idea here pipette and need 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:34.850
 take a drop of it on the lacquer but 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.220
 the only thing that droplet is not always 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.350
 spreads evenly and it is enough 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.750
 so fat is this remedy therefore 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.980
 specks of some kind may appear 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:47.330
 on the table on clothes and so on 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.250
 oiliness of course inconvenience 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.230
 but overall it is a very good tool 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.180
 which also completely copes with 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.250
 because lacquer afterwards 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.890
 means dries just instantly 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.470
 thats the only thing I would probably do 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:04.190
 I will now take it with a brush 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:06.140
 here they are using this pipette on this 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.600
 I 'm interested in your opinion 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.669
 have you tried these tools and can 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.550
 will you have any advice to me 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.919
 about tips for me about 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:20.350
 what's new is still something interesting 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:22.910
 you can also try from faberlic here 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.950
 having finished thank you so much for watching 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:27.910
 have a good day 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.910
 new videos all bye
