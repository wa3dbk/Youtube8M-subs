00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.220
 appleinsider.ru followers 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.809
 and who has no doubt that the world 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.059
 rapidly continues to go crazy 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.040
 if videobloggers used to compete 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.350
 each other for the right to be the first to release 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.210
 review of the new iPhone, now they 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.939
 seriously began to do reviews 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.550
 Chinese iphone 6 layouts from us too 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.350
 there is such a layout and not even one but we 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.720
 such nonsense will not be engaged 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.519
 our serious video we thoughtfully 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.560
 test the functionality of this 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.140
 devices but at least the one that 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.880
 so far this is available to us appleinsider.ru 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.880
 My name is Natasha I start 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.990
 none of the posts about iphone 6 about our 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.850
 the site is not without capricious 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.250
 comments like well where does it fit 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.660
 iphone turned into a shovel like now 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.190
 can be used with one hand 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.190
 Now we will check it 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.469
 our editor in chief and above grishin 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.059
 conducts a simple test that allows 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.250
 instantly determine whether he can 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.930
 use this or that smartphone he 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.580
 picks up the phone group trying to big 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.439
 finger to reach the icon top 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.170
 corner of the phone if it fails 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.909
 so this smartphone 13 suits 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.250
 because the phone can not 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.380
 use one hand no longer has 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.689
 right to call the phone and so I have 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.229
 in hand iphone 6 layout with screen 47 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.240
 inches 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.310
 and we know that there will be bigger models and 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.110
 now i will try my toning 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.569
 girl fingers to reach 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.100
 top row of icons as we see if 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:36.259
 hold the phone by the bottom of the case 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.990
 this task is almost well perhaps only 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.270
 Freddy Kruger but if you train yourself 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.979
 hold the device for the central part of the 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.130
 you can reach with your thumb 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.110
 up to the top food tender races up for 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.149
 this will have to change their habits 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.159
 but what can't you do in order to 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.159
 justify the coolness of owning at 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.460
 about fifteen years ago the phones were 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.350
 so that they could shove a pocket 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.120
 jeans designed for watches 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.770
 now people buy for phones 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.390
 special cases and bags 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.890
 and together those pocket every year 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.440
 getting harder 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.280
 let's see how to pass this test 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.280
 iphone 6 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.600
 since iphone 4 the apple phones were 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.580
 quite fit to 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.870
 enjoy watching videos just 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.150
 need to put the side of the body 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.740
 when wired does not suit such a corner 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.090
 review so they prefer to buy 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.130
 special coasters 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.960
 but most people don't have such problems 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.850
 suffers and quietly uses the iphone 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.060
 instead of a TV for example during 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.500
 snack on iphone 6 increased screen 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.890
 which makes it more convenient device 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.600
 to watch the video but is it on 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.870
 one hundred percent comfortable in this aspect 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.870
 let's check and here and no 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.740
 and so what we do first 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.480
 when we buy a new iphone 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.820
 right we go to the toilet fit in 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.980
 mirror pump out feasible sponges and 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.660
 do what why nicknames slavophiles 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.820
 call themselves shichko 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.830
 so lovers selfi can not 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.390
 worry the question of not hide behind 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.860
 this machine is the most attractive 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.860
 details of our appearance 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.320
 so often you come to the bar 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.430
 order a glass of jack daniels and and 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.740
 easy conversation with friends not 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.960
 you notice how you bring your iphone over 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.210
 a glass and now your favorite friend 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.640
 Floating whiskey I hasten to please you 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.800
 the sixth iphone such adversity is not terrible 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.110
 we tested it with a variety of 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.480
 types of packaging that were accessed in 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.730
 our office and where iphone 5s 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.420
 treacherous crawled through iphone 6 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.420
 courageously resisted 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.740
 how often have we heard this phrase macbook 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.580
 air so thin that they can cut 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.650
 sausage 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.810
 iphone always had too flat 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.759
 wide side surface so you can 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.900
 there was talk about it but it seems 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:33.419
 the situation is changing 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.280
 iphone 6 case looks quite thin 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.940
 so you can easily cut 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.940
 something soft 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.850
 and so to resume if you too 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.140
 short fingers and you are not ready to change 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.230
 your phone use habits 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:53.360
 then iphone 6 is clearly not for you if you 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:56.480
 prefer to wear pants modification 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.520
 slim fit and will throw off, or there is a threat that the 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.160
 when you sit down on your chair with your iphone 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.170
 pocket phone can bend but either 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.600
 you just have to sit stretched out 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:07.460
 forward foot does not fit this phones for 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.950
 those who like to watch on its screen 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.830
 qiblae put the parade on the side 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.720
 corps well and if you have a small face and 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.230
 do you like being photographed on the phone in 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.480
 the mirror 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.100
 I also advise you not to buy iphone 6 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.500
 since its massive body can 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.750
 hide behind all your beauty and 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.730
 charms but what if you often 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.770
 bathe your phone in a glass of whiskey 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.570
 or regular losing a knife you 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.390
 sure to appreciate 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.730
 big and slim body of the new iphone 6 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:37.160
 And there is more battery expected 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.990
 very powerful processor and amazing 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.980
 camera but we'll find out about it in 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.030
 several ideas 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.030
 don't go anywhere
