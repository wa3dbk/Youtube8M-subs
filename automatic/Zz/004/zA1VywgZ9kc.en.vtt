notice that your apps randomly will like

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.170 
notice that your apps randomly will like
spin<00:00:32.969> around<00:00:33.090> now<00:00:34.610> it's<00:00:35.610> not<00:00:35.790> like<00:00:35.940> really

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
spin around now it's not like really

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.369 
spin around now it's not like really
crazy<00:00:36.570> it's<00:00:36.989> just<00:00:37.280> every<00:00:38.280> now<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.520> then<00:00:39.379> one

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
crazy it's just every now and then one

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.869 
crazy it's just every now and then one
Apple<00:00:40.739> just<00:00:40.890> turn<00:00:41.100> around<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.670> really

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
Apple just turn around and it really

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.340 
Apple just turn around and it really
makes<00:00:42.149> your<00:00:42.300> springboard<00:00:42.660> feel<00:00:42.930> more<00:00:43.110> alive

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
makes your springboard feel more alive

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.029 
makes your springboard feel more alive
now<00:00:43.850> if<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:45.000> have<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.270> tweak<00:00:45.539> accelerate<00:00:46.289> you

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
now if you have to tweak accelerate you

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.639 
now if you have to tweak accelerate you
can<00:00:47.250> actually<00:00:47.399> modify<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.030> speed<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.750> which

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
can actually modify the speed of which

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.580 
can actually modify the speed of which
they<00:00:49.890> spin<00:00:50.340> but<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.600> think<00:00:52.140> it's<00:00:52.260> pretty<00:00:52.379> good

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
they spin but I think it's pretty good

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.439 
they spin but I think it's pretty good
just<00:00:52.770> leaving<00:00:53.100> them<00:00:53.160> like<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.910> normal<00:00:54.120> speed

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
just leaving them like the normal speed

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.340 
just leaving them like the normal speed
not<00:00:54.960> too<00:00:55.110> fast<00:00:55.379> not<00:00:55.649> too<00:00:55.800> slow<00:00:56.270> see<00:00:57.270> ya<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:58.079> is

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
not too fast not too slow see ya that is

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.420 
not too fast not too slow see ya that is
random<00:00:58.920> icon<00:00:59.250> flip<00:00:59.489> in<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.670> third<00:00:59.910> place<00:01:00.090> in

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.720 
just gonna pick one so let's just say
this<00:03:20.820> one<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.890> you'll<00:03:22.890> get<00:03:23.040> an<00:03:23.130> ad<00:03:23.250> but<00:03:23.489> most

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
this one and you'll get an ad but most

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:24.920 
this one and you'll get an ad but most
of<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:23.940> time<00:03:24.150> which<00:03:24.390> is<00:03:24.420> kind<00:03:24.660> of<00:03:24.750> annoying

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
of the time which is kind of annoying

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.710 
of the time which is kind of annoying
but<00:03:25.350> if<00:03:26.160> it<00:03:26.370> says<00:03:26.609> no<00:03:26.790> results<00:03:27.299> this<00:03:27.630> is

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
but if it says no results this is

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.560 
but if it says no results this is
probably<00:03:27.930> due<00:03:28.350> to<00:03:28.500> slow<00:03:29.130> internet<00:03:29.820> but<00:03:30.060> all

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
probably due to slow internet but all

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.479 
probably due to slow internet but all
right<00:03:30.690> there's<00:03:30.840> no<00:03:30.930> results<00:03:31.320> on<00:03:31.440> that<00:03:31.590> one<00:03:31.739> so

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
right there's no results on that one so

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.220
