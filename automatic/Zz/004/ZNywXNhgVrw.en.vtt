00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
and to keep it tangle free now that that

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.840 
and to keep it tangle free now that that
cord<00:02:07.979> looks<00:02:08.100> a<00:02:08.190> little<00:02:08.280> bit<00:02:08.429> thicker<00:02:08.640> than

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
cord looks a little bit thicker than

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.150 
cord looks a little bit thicker than
some<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.119> your<00:02:09.209> other<00:02:09.240> cables<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.830> it

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
some of your other cables is it is it

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.860 
some of your other cables is it is it
just<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.520> look<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:12.090> retro<00:02:12.450> look<00:02:12.630> that<00:02:12.750> you're

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
just a look that retro look that you're

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.300 
just a look that retro look that you're
going<00:02:12.990> for<00:02:13.230> it<00:02:13.290> or<00:02:13.380> is<00:02:13.500> there<00:02:13.620> actually<00:02:13.740> more

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
going for it or is there actually more

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.220 
going for it or is there actually more
wire<00:02:15.030> in<00:02:15.240> theirs<00:02:15.390> or<00:02:15.569> more<00:02:15.690> copper<00:02:15.900> in<00:02:16.110> there

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
wire in theirs or more copper in there

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.050 
wire in theirs or more copper in there
yeah<00:02:16.380> there's<00:02:16.560> more<00:02:16.770> copper<00:02:17.130> in<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.310> wire<00:02:17.459> and

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
yeah there's more copper in the wire and

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.670 
yeah there's more copper in the wire and
we<00:02:18.180> did<00:02:18.300> that<00:02:18.330> because<00:02:18.900> we<00:02:19.110> have<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.260> single

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
we did that because we have a single

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.190 
we did that because we have a single
cord<00:02:20.010> feeding<00:02:20.459> both<00:02:20.670> of<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.510> left<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:22.170> right

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
cord feeding both of the left and right

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.840 
cord feeding both of the left and right
speakers<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:22.830> we<00:02:22.860> got<00:02:23.069> more<00:02:23.250> cable<00:02:23.640> in<00:02:23.730> the

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
speakers so we got more cable in the

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.150 
speakers so we got more cable in the
single<00:02:24.270> cord<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:25.140> because<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:25.830> looks<00:02:26.010> better

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
single cord and because it looks better

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.120 
single cord and because it looks better
and<00:02:26.370> it<00:02:26.459> sounds<00:02:26.790> better<00:02:27.709> it<00:02:28.709> does<00:02:28.920> make<00:02:29.069> a

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
and it sounds better it does make a

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.620 
and it sounds better it does make a
difference<00:02:29.370> out<00:02:29.670> Bait<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:29.940> cable<00:02:30.270> is<00:02:30.420> and

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
difference out Bait the cable is and

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.240 
difference out Bait the cable is and
this<00:02:30.690> is<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.870> high<00:02:31.020> quality<00:02:31.080> cable<00:02:31.770> we're<00:02:31.890> using

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
this is a high quality cable we're using

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.840 
this is a high quality cable we're using
here<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:33.440> with<00:02:34.440> these<00:02:34.590> cones<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.580> actual

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
here and with these cones and the actual

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.650 
here and with these cones and the actual
can<00:02:36.180> type<00:02:36.690> of<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.010> material<00:02:38.300> like<00:02:39.300> I<00:02:39.510> said

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
can type of the material like I said

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.210 
can type of the material like I said
earlier<00:02:39.720> this<00:02:39.959> keeps<00:02:40.320> it<00:02:40.500> when<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:40.890> put<00:02:41.070> these

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
earlier this keeps it when you put these

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.370 
earlier this keeps it when you put these
on<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.670> blocks<00:02:41.940> out<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.209> exterior<00:02:42.840> noise<00:02:43.050> and

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
on it blocks out the exterior noise and

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.920 
on it blocks out the exterior noise and
keeps<00:02:44.040> music<00:02:44.519> from<00:02:44.640> bleeding<00:02:44.880> out<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:45.840> you

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
keeps music from bleeding out so you

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.990 
keeps music from bleeding out so you
don't<00:02:46.230> annoy<00:02:46.410> your<00:02:46.620> loved<00:02:47.220> one<00:02:47.459> or<00:02:47.700> your
