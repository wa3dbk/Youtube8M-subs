we have samples in process now to take

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.440 
we have samples in process now to take
about<00:00:33.550> six<00:00:33.940> months<00:00:34.030> ago

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.880 

first<00:00:37.450> so<00:00:37.810> the<00:00:38.020> first<00:00:38.260> batch<00:00:38.530> will<00:00:38.860> be

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
first so the first batch will be

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.210 
first so the first batch will be
basically<00:00:39.520> our<00:00:39.670> implement<00:00:40.540> but<00:00:41.470> then<00:00:41.710> our<00:00:42.010> we

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
basically our implement but then our we

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.610 
basically our implement but then our we
don't<00:00:42.430> have<00:00:42.730> a<00:00:42.760> full<00:00:43.060> world<00:00:43.440> production<00:00:44.440> of

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
don't have a full world production of

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.029 
don't have a full world production of
the<00:00:44.830> model

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
the model

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.209 
the model
yes<00:00:47.550> eventually<00:00:47.879> we<00:00:48.660> will<00:00:48.870> bring<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.289> rifles

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
yes eventually we will bring in rifles

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.970 
yes eventually we will bring in rifles
that<00:00:50.339> are<00:00:50.399> built<00:00:50.879> one

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
that are built one

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.060 
that are built one
at<00:00:53.130> first<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.790> then<00:00:53.910> we'll<00:00:54.120> look

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
at first and then we'll look

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.470 
at first and then we'll look
u.s.<00:00:56.400> parts<00:00:56.790> which<00:00:57.000> we<00:00:57.660> will<00:00:57.870> man<00:00:58.170> up

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.980 

okay<00:01:02.480> and<00:01:02.720> then<00:01:02.930> eventually

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.910 

probably<00:01:06.990> being

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.980 

so<00:01:11.920> we<00:01:12.130> are<00:01:12.190> basically<00:01:12.400> studying<00:01:13.090> on<00:01:13.270> and<00:01:13.510> with

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
so we are basically studying on and with

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.780 
so we are basically studying on and with
the<00:01:14.020> new<00:01:14.260> complacency<00:01:14.980> wanna<00:01:15.160> swap<00:01:15.550> with

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
the new complacency wanna swap with

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:22.830 
the new complacency wanna swap with
bigger<00:01:16.000> groups<00:01:20.520> but<00:01:21.520> as<00:01:21.910> far<00:01:22.180> as<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.450> barrels

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
bigger groups but as far as the barrels

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.460 
bigger groups but as far as the barrels
are<00:01:23.110> a<00:01:23.740> puzzle<00:01:24.340> grades<00:01:24.760> and<00:01:25.060> everything

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
are a puzzle grades and everything

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.210 
are a puzzle grades and everything
bothers<00:01:26.970> us<00:01:27.970> maybe<00:01:28.620> getting<00:01:29.620> the<00:01:29.740> minimum<00:01:29.980> of

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
bothers us maybe getting the minimum of

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.610 
bothers us maybe getting the minimum of
six<00:01:30.580> is<00:01:30.760> not<00:01:30.910> a<00:01:30.970> problem<00:01:31.540> for<00:01:31.720> us<00:01:31.990> yes<00:01:32.290> because

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
six is not a problem for us yes because

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.100 
six is not a problem for us yes because

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
serial number information they have to

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.500 
serial number information they have to
be<00:02:40.870> logo<00:02:41.260> on<00:02:41.409> the<00:02:41.560> side<00:02:41.739> all<00:02:42.510> manufacturing

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
be logo on the side all manufacturing

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.570 
be logo on the side all manufacturing

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
being tested right now in the field we

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.710 
being tested right now in the field we
brought<00:03:03.520> one<00:03:03.730> of<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.880> prototypes<00:03:04.120> to<00:03:04.630> the

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
brought one of the prototypes to the

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.530 
brought one of the prototypes to the
show<00:03:04.930> here<00:03:05.230> which<00:03:05.500> you<00:03:05.620> can

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
and there'll be a 1% interchangeability

you know definitely a hesitancy right

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:43.839 
you know definitely a hesitancy right
here<00:03:40.299> any<00:03:41.299> plans<00:03:41.599> for<00:03:41.689> the<00:03:41.810> 5:45

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
here any plans for the 5:45

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.300 
here any plans for the 5:45
you<00:03:44.299> don't<00:03:44.480> need<00:03:44.719> plans<00:03:44.989> for<00:03:45.230> that<00:03:45.379> this<00:03:46.040> time

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
you don't need plans for that this time

we<00:03:46.549> had<00:03:46.790> prototypes<00:03:47.780> for<00:03:48.079> two<00:03:48.379> years<00:03:48.680> now<00:03:48.980> um

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
we had prototypes for two years now um

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.990 
we had prototypes for two years now um
testing<00:03:49.969> so<00:03:50.930> there's<00:03:51.500> a<00:03:51.590> possibility<00:03:52.099> we<00:03:52.609> are

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
testing so there's a possibility we are

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000 
testing so there's a possibility we are
tuned<00:03:53.329> for<00:03:53.719> it<00:03:53.870> but<00:03:54.349> did<00:03:54.500> we<00:03:54.620> just<00:03:54.769> have<00:03:54.920> to

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
tuned for it but did we just have to

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.250 
tuned for it but did we just have to
