00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
record even more classical which is

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.230 
record even more classical which is
something<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.550> we've<00:01:59.670> never<00:01:59.850> really

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
something that we've never really

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.070 
something that we've never really
incorporated<00:02:00.840> into<00:02:00.990> Dellinger

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
this idea believe it or not I always

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.470 
this idea believe it or not I always
wanted<00:04:23.100> to<00:04:23.190> go<00:04:23.310> Wireless<00:04:23.730> but<00:04:23.910> I<00:04:23.970> was<00:04:24.090> scared

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
wanted to go Wireless but I was scared

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.060 
wanted to go Wireless but I was scared
that<00:04:24.570> that<00:04:25.260> Wireless<00:04:26.130> packs<00:04:26.400> are<00:04:26.550> great

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
that that Wireless packs are great

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.280 
that that Wireless packs are great
active<00:04:29.070> viable<00:04:29.580> stage<00:04:29.820> so<00:04:30.660> then<00:04:31.020> I<00:04:31.050> thought

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
active viable stage so then I thought

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.590 
active viable stage so then I thought
the<00:04:31.440> idea<00:04:31.530> will<00:04:31.890> seal<00:04:32.760> the<00:04:32.940> wireless<00:04:33.270> inside

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
the idea will seal the wireless inside

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.100 
the idea will seal the wireless inside
the<00:04:33.720> guitar

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.279 

do<00:04:36.800> that<00:04:37.009> so<00:04:37.669> we<00:04:38.030> took<00:04:38.330> a<00:04:38.389> wireless<00:04:38.840> system<00:04:38.990> out

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
do that so we took a wireless system out

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.580 
do that so we took a wireless system out
of<00:04:39.409> its<00:04:39.560> casing<00:04:39.830> and<00:04:40.729> just<00:04:41.689> put<00:04:41.960> it<00:04:42.050> inside<00:04:42.199> the

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
of its casing and just put it inside the

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.610 
of its casing and just put it inside the
cavity<00:04:43.039> of<00:04:44.030> the<00:04:44.180> guitar<00:04:44.509> and<00:04:44.810> the<00:04:45.199> antenna
