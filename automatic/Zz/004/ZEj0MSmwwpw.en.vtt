and<00:02:39.630> I<00:02:39.720> don't<00:02:39.960> know<00:02:40.230> why<00:02:41.130> I<00:02:41.160> Malcolm<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.480> I'm

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
and I don't know why I Malcolm and I'm

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.750 
and I don't know why I Malcolm and I'm
not<00:02:42.720> interested<00:02:43.080> he<00:02:43.830> started<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.340> create<00:02:44.580> each

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
not interested he started to create each

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.210 
not interested he started to create each
one<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.030> us<00:02:45.210> and<00:02:45.450> created<00:02:46.440> each<00:02:46.680> one<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:46.980> us

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
one of us and created each one of us

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.930 
one of us and created each one of us
infinitely<00:02:48.080> zero<00:02:49.130> so<00:02:50.130> that's<00:02:50.340> how<00:02:50.490> we<00:02:50.520> began

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
infinitely zero so that's how we began

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.810 
infinitely zero so that's how we began
and<00:02:51.870> so<00:02:52.800> what<00:02:53.100> does<00:02:53.250> it<00:02:53.400> need<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.670> be

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
and so what does it need to be

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.180 
and so what does it need to be
infinitely<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.840> know<00:02:54.959> me<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.260> we<00:02:55.440> experienced

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
infinitely to know me and we experienced

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.050 
infinitely to know me and we experienced
heaven<00:02:56.400> on<00:02:56.640> earth<00:02:57.050> move<00:02:58.050> on<00:02:58.850> our<00:03:00.080> beauty
