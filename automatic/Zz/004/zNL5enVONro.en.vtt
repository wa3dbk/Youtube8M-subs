00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.550
 Hello, you are watching the charger review 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.220
 devices goal virus hiv 8 included 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.440
 solar panel but we are 35 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.410
 we all need energy to work 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.690
 camera phones navigators and other 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.880
 devices when you find yourself in 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.070
 wildlife conditions or in another 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.320
 areas where there is no electrical network 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.689
 this question becomes especially 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.839
 topical not so long ago during the hike 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.520
 I wondered if there was a possibility 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:35.160
 recharge the camcorder while in 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.410
 untouched by civilization after 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.870
 long searches I opted for 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.570
 charging kit naked po switch 8 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.250
 I needed to consider all the factors 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.290
 concerning the charging of electronic devices 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.540
 field conditions when choosing a device 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.870
 to charge with solar power 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.600
 I took into account the following points how much 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.550
 energy i need a day can i 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.980
 take a ride powerful enough charger 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.080
 device and how effective is it 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.450
 my camcorder will work 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.700
 discharged after two hours continuous 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.920
 work and I have to turn it off 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.840
 after each short clip so 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.460
 the way that i need to charge it 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.320
 more than once a day 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.530
 should also consider the capacity 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.350
 the battery for my camera is 1.25 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.549
 ampere hours so every day is not 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.509
 this amount of energy is required 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.609
 the kit provides me 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.710
 extra energy for charging 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:34.619
 cameras from one to two times a day 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.539
 after clearing the details, I began searching 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.770
 chose a switch 8 charging kit 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.890
 switch 8 charger 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.439
 equipped with a lithium-ion battery 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.719
 2 and 2 tenths amps of hour 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.329
 enough for almost two of my charges 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:53.520
 camcorders 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.359
 This means that the camera is charging one 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.969
 once fully 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:59.429
 and will remain energy for the second not complete 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.740
 recharging is very convenient 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.869
 possibility of charging switch 8 in front 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.350
 a trip using your computer's port 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.690
 or a laptop other than a charger 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.840
 solar panel included but mind 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.420
 from 35 which is equipped with usb port 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.590
 voltage of 5 volts and a power of 2 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.900
 half wa 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.370
 according to the stated specifications with 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.950
 using a solar panel 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.709
 switch 8 charges from five to ten 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.230
 hours depending on the weather this 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.709
 a set of the most compact goal in the lineup 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.110
 zero 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.360
 it's great for hiking 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.630
 or mountain climbing folded 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.069
 able panel but we are 35 sizes 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.220
 sixteen and a half 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.989
 by 14 centimeters with a thickness of 2 s 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.769
 half a centimeter in unfolded 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.330
 condition it measures 35 by 14 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.360
 centimeters the whole set 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.180
 weighs just over 300 grams solar 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.720
 the panel has 8 loops for fastening to 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.030
 backpack 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.980
 located on the back of the panel 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.489
 a small pocket in which you can 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.370
 put 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.709
 power supply there are outputs 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.500
 solar panel also in pocket 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.220
 you can put cables or rechargeable 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.130
 device 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.950
 loops for fastening to a backpack very 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.620
 durable and obviously last for a long time 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.720
 time besides the design of the device 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.030
 very well thought out considering 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.700
 needs of hikers switch 8 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.730
 charged by the via one port and yusb 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.950
 charging other devices through 2 side 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.840
 light indicators are located 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.319
 battery charge levels 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.150
 in increments of 20 percent when operating 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.680
 charging kit have two points 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.850
 who need to know 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.340
 charger switch 8 is not 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.750
 waterproof and solar panel 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.030
 waterproof but not intended 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.310
 to dive in the rain 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.590
 you need to disconnect the usb cable from 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.019
 solar panel and charger 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.880
 put in the backpack but if on switch 8 everything 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.160
 same water then before the next 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.799
 turning it on should be dried 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.459
 during a recent three day hike i 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:07.019
 never discharged switch 8 completely 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.569
 solar panel copes with 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.040
 charge level support charging time 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.739
 devices from switch 8 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.690
 does not exceed the time of their charging from the network 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.180
 note that switch 8 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.920
 designed to charge pocket 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.350
 devices 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.370
 to charge more powerful devices in 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.280
 ruler goal zero 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:28.060
 there are more powerful power sources and 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.060
 solar panels
