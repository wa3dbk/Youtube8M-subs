 one is doing another in the middle of the 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.010
 circuit is to accelerate 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.680
 within a segment of the trace 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.060
 if you want to abort in any way 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.160
 well watch box 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.890

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.360
 includes coast 'way to raise the hand not 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.629
 had 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.439
 the other thing would be in the 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:46.199
 coffee 

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:48.389
 so it is not a risk of urbanism in 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:51.569
 guiné plata oil we already had some 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:54.780
 programs there then to the council 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:59.909
 that I give and never rise celebrated by 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:03.030
 left within the ascending class is 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:06.150
 my even when you have some stubborn 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:09.360
 the bus from the ascent to compel the staff 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:12.569
 make the decision there on the wall side 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:16.259
 climb to the board is 17 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:18.779
 take the curve is the only way you 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:21.509
 who does not get up and could not 

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:23.310
 make the curve in front of the wall right there 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:26.639
 you made hell 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.659
 Nothing escapes and I hit the wall at the time and there 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:30.659
 it's fatal 

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:33.810
 So the advice I give does not go up. 

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:36.539
 on the left it is not saw 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:42.719
 more than 200 per hour is very dangerous 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:45.270
 Ok it 's true that he talks a lot of coffee. 

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:47.279
 even the rise of coffee is dangerous 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.080

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:51.389

 motorcycles arrive here a very list 

00:06:56.069 --> 00:07:00.270
 great 

00:06:56.669 --> 00:07:04.349
 one option is to stay here is really cool and in 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:08.069
 quality is there and the basic shows but 

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:11.159
 the experienced think the exchange is place 

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:13.979
