00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:29.400
 Good morning, everyone thought of making this video. 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:33.870
 then to remember how to disassemble 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:38.220
 panel but I think it can help more 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.950
 people who do not show you with 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.820
 details on how to disassemble this panel 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.190
 All center here in spacefox 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.629
 I believe that this tip is also useful for 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.730
 who has fox 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.310
 I imagine that the panel is not as 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.200
 different so the fittings do not 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.239
 be so different 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.910
 the first step is to take this fake 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.270
 button has here flashing alert side 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.360
 the movement continues he holds it here 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.000
 down with three fingers here and there 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:15.259
 with the finger for sale back your 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.259
 thumb makes this lever here in the 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:27.479
 australia and already it is released of certain he 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:33.030
 is secured by these two tabs a 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.890
 I have not suffered enough 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.300
 to take off this button did not know it was 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:45.780
 so easy why he's here and 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:53.910
 I hope you also want to get the 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:02:08.880
 second button here the middle radio there 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:18.900
 back because the one that holds this button 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:28.760
 here are these chickens here now is 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:28.760
 connecting is not the same thing 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.970
 the button out here is just to get you that 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:55.140
 connection is that the detail of the beam and I 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:57.480
 I then said access to the four 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:19.560
 bolts on finally the four 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:22.130
 screws in the back well there is not 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:27.780
 so easy to like 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:35.400
 we have the other two with the help of 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:38.850
 my fifth here for the merger 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:43.280
 the intention is to take this whole part here 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.280
 from the center of the species panel 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.660
 I need to see her as she is. 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.970
 this radio installation 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:55.230
 I'm suspicious that it's very bad 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.760
 It has done and is not easy to arrange people 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.580
 a screw 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:05.900
 it was difficult to find wherever and 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.900
 enough is full of fixation up here 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:14.500
 very delicate plastic and very easy 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:18.040
 said to burst 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:21.060
 so be careful 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.060
 take it all away
