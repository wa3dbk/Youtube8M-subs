I<00:02:13.160> would<00:02:13.370> say<00:02:13.520> it's<00:02:13.670> not<00:02:13.820> as<00:02:14.180> popular<00:02:14.390> as

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
I would say it's not as popular as

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.450 
I would say it's not as popular as
basketball<00:02:15.650> or<00:02:15.860> badminton<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:17.060> billiards

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
basketball or badminton and billiards

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.260 
basketball or badminton and billiards
not<00:02:19.460> a<00:02:19.490> lot<00:02:19.790> of<00:02:20.000> people<00:02:20.840> do<00:02:21.140> both<00:02:21.440> because<00:02:21.890> of

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
not a lot of people do both because of

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.060 
not a lot of people do both because of
they<00:02:23.270> consider<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:23.780> as<00:02:23.990> an<00:02:24.110> expensive<00:02:24.680> sport
