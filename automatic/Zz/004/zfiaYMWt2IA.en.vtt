on<00:00:07.109> your<00:00:07.259> FLL<00:00:07.680> robot<00:00:12.769> so<00:00:13.769> I'm<00:00:14.070> back<00:00:14.309> this<00:00:14.580> week

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
on your FLL robot so I'm back this week

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.120 
on your FLL robot so I'm back this week
with<00:00:15.030> another<00:00:15.150> fan<00:00:15.719> suggested<00:00:16.350> tutorial<00:00:16.859> and

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
with another fan suggested tutorial and

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.849 
with another fan suggested tutorial and
this<00:00:18.060> may<00:00:18.270> seem<00:00:18.330> like<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.810> weird<00:00:19.199> topic<00:00:19.470> for<00:00:19.830> a

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
this may seem like a weird topic for a

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.620 
this may seem like a weird topic for a
tutorial<00:00:20.189> but<00:00:20.730> it's<00:00:20.880> actually<00:00:21.330> pretty

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
tutorial but it's actually pretty

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.750 
tutorial but it's actually pretty
important<00:00:22.230> especially<00:00:23.010> for<00:00:23.189> younger<00:00:23.430> teams

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
important especially for younger teams

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.130 
important especially for younger teams
who<00:00:23.970> are<00:00:24.000> just<00:00:24.269> starting<00:00:24.510> out<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:24.960> don't

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
who are just starting out and don't

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.439 
who are just starting out and don't
understand<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.859> importance<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.580> this<00:00:26.789> so

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
understand the importance of this so

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.779 
understand the importance of this so
anyway<00:00:27.930> if<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.529> can<00:00:28.710> imagine<00:00:29.189> building<00:00:29.369> a

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
anyway if you can imagine building a

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.569 
anyway if you can imagine building a
robot<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.960> FLL<00:00:31.560> that's<00:00:31.769> capable<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.309> scoring

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
robot in FLL that's capable of scoring

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.000 
robot in FLL that's capable of scoring
500<00:00:33.480> points<00:00:33.840> you're<00:00:34.200> all<00:00:34.350> excited<00:00:34.710> because

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
500 points you're all excited because

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.950 
500 points you're all excited because
you're<00:00:35.309> gonna<00:00:35.430> win<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:35.820> everything<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.480> then

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
you're gonna win in everything and then

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.780 
you're gonna win in everything and then
you<00:00:37.079> go<00:00:37.290> there<00:00:37.500> it's<00:00:37.680> competition<00:00:38.010> time<00:00:38.340> and

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
you go there it's competition time and

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.990 
you go there it's competition time and
then<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.329> have<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.809> wire<00:00:40.379> sticking<00:00:40.860> out<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.489> it

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
then you have a wire sticking out and it

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.060 
then you have a wire sticking out and it
just<00:00:42.210> gets<00:00:42.390> snagged<00:00:42.840> on<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.140> mission<00:00:43.559> model<00:00:43.920> and

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
just gets snagged on a mission model and

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.340 
just gets snagged on a mission model and
then<00:00:44.460> that's<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.879> your<00:00:45.000> robots<00:00:45.390> finished<00:00:45.899> that

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
then that's it your robots finished that

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.080 
then that's it your robots finished that
would<00:00:46.500> really<00:00:46.649> stink<00:00:47.070> right<00:00:47.280> well<00:00:47.940> if<00:00:48.059> you

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
would really stink right well if you

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.150 
would really stink right well if you

is to neatly coil all of the wires
within<00:01:00.420> your<00:01:00.750> robot<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.379> you've<00:01:01.739> probably

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
within your robot and you've probably

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.009 
within your robot and you've probably
heard<00:01:02.309> me<00:01:02.370> say<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:02.760> before<00:01:03.090> if<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.600> watch<00:01:03.780> my

step if you see this picture here what

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.190 
step if you see this picture here what
I've<00:01:11.010> done<00:01:11.250> with<00:01:11.490> my<00:01:11.520> robot<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.299> all<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
I've done with my robot is all of the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.320 
I've done with my robot is all of the
wires<00:01:13.500> are<00:01:13.890> neatly<00:01:14.130> coiled<00:01:14.610> within<00:01:15.150> this

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
wires are neatly coiled within this

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.080 
wires are neatly coiled within this
robot<00:01:15.810> on<00:01:16.020> either<00:01:16.500> side<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.159> because<00:01:17.970> you

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
robot on either side and because you

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.640 
robot on either side and because you
don't<00:01:18.210> want<00:01:18.450> your<00:01:18.570> robot<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:19.080> drive<00:01:19.320> around

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
don't want your robot to drive around

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.380 
don't want your robot to drive around
like<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> spaghetti<00:01:20.189> monster<00:01:20.670> with<00:01:21.090> wires

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
like a spaghetti monster with wires

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.330 
like a spaghetti monster with wires
hanging<00:01:21.810> out<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.290> everywhere<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.890> then<00:01:23.280> you

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
hanging out of everywhere and then you

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.280 
hanging out of everywhere and then you
get<00:01:23.490> snags<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:24.119> something<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.810> then<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.170> have

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
get snags on something and then you have

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.960 
get snags on something and then you have
to<00:01:25.409> keep<00:01:25.560> rescuing<00:01:25.860> your<00:01:26.100> robot<00:01:26.400> wasting<00:01:26.850> all

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
to keep rescuing your robot wasting all

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.630 
to keep rescuing your robot wasting all
those<00:01:27.150> points<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.810> keep<00:01:28.619> your<00:01:28.770> wires<00:01:29.040> neatly

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
those points you keep your wires neatly

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.850 
those points you keep your wires neatly
coiled<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.420> contained<00:01:30.869> inside<00:01:31.079> your<00:01:31.500> robot

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
coiled and contained inside your robot

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.980 
coiled and contained inside your robot
so<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.520> can't<00:01:32.759> snag<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.329> anything<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.869> also

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
so it can't snag on anything it also

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.080 
so it can't snag on anything it also
looks<00:01:34.380> nice<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.920> neat<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.579> judges<00:01:35.939> will

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
looks nice and neat and the judges will

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.840 
looks nice and neat and the judges will
really<00:01:36.240> appreciate<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.159> my<00:01:38.159> second<00:01:38.670> tip<00:01:38.790> is

really appreciate that my second tip is
try<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.270> keep<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.750> wiring<00:01:40.290> scheme<00:01:40.680> as<00:01:40.950> simple

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
try to keep the wiring scheme as simple

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.910 
try to keep the wiring scheme as simple
as<00:01:41.670> possible<00:01:42.329> like<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.079> don't<00:01:43.500> want<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.829> make

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
as possible like you don't want to make

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.980 
as possible like you don't want to make
something<00:01:44.250> purposely<00:01:44.970> confusing<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.930> that

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
something purposely confusing and that

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.590 
something purposely confusing and that
that's<00:01:46.530> where<00:01:46.740> mistakes<00:01:47.220> occur<00:01:47.549> like<00:01:48.030> even<00:01:48.450> da

you<00:02:00.000> have<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.540> sensor<00:02:01.110> that's<00:02:01.530> on<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.009> left

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
you have a sensor that's on the left

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.340 
you have a sensor that's on the left
side<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.700> robot<00:02:03.060> then<00:02:03.540> plug<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.049> into<00:02:04.320> a

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
side of the robot then plug it into a

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.410 
side of the robot then plug it into a
sensor<00:02:04.829> port<00:02:05.130> that's<00:02:05.490> on<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.820> left<00:02:06.060> side<00:02:06.240> of

the<00:02:06.479> robot<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:06.990> run<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.680> wire<00:02:07.920> down<00:02:08.310> the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
the robot and run that wire down the

left side of the robot

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.420 
left side of the robot
I<00:02:09.629> mean<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.140> sounds<00:02:10.560> really<00:02:10.739> annoying<00:02:11.219> and

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
I mean it sounds really annoying and

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.369 
I mean it sounds really annoying and
repetitive<00:02:11.939> but<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.569> just<00:02:12.810> keeps<00:02:13.019> everything

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
repetitive but it just keeps everything

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.220 
repetitive but it just keeps everything
so<00:02:13.769> simple<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.430> left<00:02:15.180> sensor<00:02:15.599> plugged<00:02:15.930> into<00:02:16.109> a

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
so simple a left sensor plugged into a

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.080 
so simple a left sensor plugged into a
left<00:02:16.499> port<00:02:16.829> with<00:02:17.189> a<00:02:17.219> wire<00:02:17.430> running<00:02:17.670> down<00:02:17.969> the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
left port with a wire running down the

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
left side of the robot everything makes

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.770 
left side of the robot everything makes
sense<00:02:20.219> and<00:02:20.459> it's<00:02:20.609> just<00:02:20.849> so<00:02:21.030> much<00:02:21.180> easier<00:02:21.239> to

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
sense and it's just so much easier to

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.559 
sense and it's just so much easier to
manage<00:02:22.219> tip<00:02:23.219> number<00:02:23.430> three<00:02:23.879> is<00:02:23.909> to<00:02:24.180> establish

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
manage tip number three is to establish

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.899 
manage tip number three is to establish
a<00:02:25.139> wiring<00:02:25.469> scheme<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.159> your<00:02:26.310> entire<00:02:26.609> team

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
a wiring scheme that your entire team

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.209 
a wiring scheme that your entire team
understands<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:27.930> can<00:02:28.379> all<00:02:28.530> agree<00:02:28.680> on<00:02:29.069> and

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:29.219 
understands and can all agree on and

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:31.640 
understands and can all agree on and
this<00:02:29.849> is<00:02:29.909> important<00:02:30.629> because<00:02:31.019> if<00:02:31.319> little

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
this is important because if little

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.800 
this is important because if little
Johnny<00:02:31.950> goes<00:02:32.099> up<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.639> the<00:02:32.760> competition<00:02:32.969> table

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
Johnny goes up to the competition table

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.809 
Johnny goes up to the competition table
to<00:02:33.959> do<00:02:34.079> the<00:02:34.200> robot<00:02:34.349> and<00:02:34.709> something<00:02:35.370> goes<00:02:35.519> wrong

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
to do the robot and something goes wrong

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.089 
to do the robot and something goes wrong
or<00:02:36.090> he<00:02:36.299> needs<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.659> change<00:02:36.900> out<00:02:37.109> a<00:02:37.139> sensor<00:02:37.650> you

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
or he needs to change out a sensor you

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.399 
or he needs to change out a sensor you
want<00:02:38.370> little<00:02:38.579> Johnny<00:02:38.969> to<00:02:39.540> understand<00:02:40.079> and

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
want little Johnny to understand and

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.080 
want little Johnny to understand and
know<00:02:40.530> what<00:02:40.739> he's<00:02:40.859> doing<00:02:41.249> at<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.459> competition

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
know what he's doing at that competition

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.659 
know what he's doing at that competition
table<00:02:42.659> so<00:02:43.079> you<00:02:43.139> want<00:02:43.379> your<00:02:43.560> whole<00:02:43.799> team<00:02:44.129> to

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:44.669 
table so you want your whole team to

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:46.909 
table so you want your whole team to
know<00:02:44.849> how<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.180> fix<00:02:46.169> something<00:02:46.439> if<00:02:46.709> something

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:46.919 
know how to fix something if something

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:49.339 
know how to fix something if something
goes<00:02:47.159> wrong<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:48.060> applies<00:02:48.569> beyond<00:02:49.139> the

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
goes wrong this applies beyond the

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.289 
goes wrong this applies beyond the
wiring<00:02:49.829> this<00:02:50.250> pretty<00:02:50.489> much<00:02:50.669> applies<00:02:50.969> for

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
wiring this pretty much applies for

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.689 
wiring this pretty much applies for
anything<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:52.169> can<00:02:52.379> think<00:02:52.769> of<00:02:52.889> about<00:02:53.459> your

hardware in FLL or even your software so

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.479 
hardware in FLL or even your software so
anyway<00:02:57.209> in<00:02:57.389> summary<00:02:57.769> make<00:02:58.769> a<00:02:58.799> wiring<00:02:59.250> scheme

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
anyway in summary make a wiring scheme

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:00.890 
anyway in summary make a wiring scheme
that<00:02:59.669> your<00:02:59.790> whole<00:02:59.969> team<00:03:00.209> agrees<00:03:00.540> on<00:03:00.719> and

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
that your whole team agrees on and

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.740 
that your whole team agrees on and
understands<00:03:01.879> another<00:03:02.879> thing<00:03:03.419> that<00:03:03.629> I've

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
understands another thing that I've

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.629 
understands another thing that I've
never<00:03:04.019> personally<00:03:04.620> tried<00:03:05.010> what<00:03:05.310> I've<00:03:05.430> seen

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:05.639 
never personally tried what I've seen

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.209 
never personally tried what I've seen
other<00:03:05.879> teams<00:03:06.209> do<00:03:06.480> is<00:03:06.719> label<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.650> parts<00:03:07.949> of

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:08.219 
other teams do is label the parts of

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:10.099 
other teams do is label the parts of
your<00:03:08.370> robot<00:03:08.819> so<00:03:09.299> like<00:03:09.510> let's<00:03:09.750> say<00:03:09.900> this<00:03:10.049> is

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
your robot so like let's say this is

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.250 
your robot so like let's say this is
color<00:03:10.500> sensor<00:03:10.980> three<00:03:11.430> have<00:03:12.139> labeled<00:03:13.139> this

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
color sensor three have labeled this

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.259 
color sensor three have labeled this
three<00:03:13.709> with<00:03:13.919> like<00:03:14.069> a<00:03:14.099> little<00:03:14.280> post-it<00:03:14.819> note<00:03:15.030> or

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
three with like a little post-it note or

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.229 
three with like a little post-it note or
marker<00:03:15.840> or<00:03:16.049> something<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:17.099> label<00:03:17.879> the<00:03:18.000> wire

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
marker or something and label the wire

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.770 
marker or something and label the wire
it<00:03:18.659> plugs<00:03:19.379> into<00:03:19.620> also<00:03:20.189> three<00:03:20.939> and<00:03:21.180> so<00:03:21.689> you

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
it plugs into also three and so you

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.509 
it plugs into also three and so you
could<00:03:21.989> see<00:03:22.199> you<00:03:22.409> could<00:03:22.560> trace<00:03:22.829> it<00:03:23.040> back<00:03:23.220> to

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
could see you could trace it back to

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.969 
could see you could trace it back to
port<00:03:24.060> 3<00:03:24.329> and<00:03:24.509> I<00:03:24.540> say<00:03:24.780> that's<00:03:25.199> color<00:03:25.560> sensor

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:25.979 
port 3 and I say that's color sensor

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:27.710 
port 3 and I say that's color sensor
three<00:03:26.310> there<00:03:26.549> and<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:27.150> could<00:03:27.299> also<00:03:27.449> do<00:03:27.689> that

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
three there and you could also do that

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.020 
three there and you could also do that
with<00:03:27.900> motors<00:03:28.439> and<00:03:28.620> stuff<00:03:28.769> it's<00:03:29.310> just<00:03:29.430> a<00:03:29.669> neat

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
with motors and stuff it's just a neat

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.569 
with motors and stuff it's just a neat
trick<00:03:30.239> to<00:03:30.509> keep<00:03:30.689> everything<00:03:30.959> organized<00:03:31.579> my

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
trick to keep everything organized my

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.849 
trick to keep everything organized my
last<00:03:32.849> and<00:03:33.180> final<00:03:33.239> tip<00:03:33.810> is<00:03:34.019> that<00:03:34.290> after<00:03:34.680> you've

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
last and final tip is that after you've

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.860 
last and final tip is that after you've
established<00:03:35.040> this<00:03:35.879> whole<00:03:36.090> wiring<00:03:36.599> scheme

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
established this whole wiring scheme

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.530 
established this whole wiring scheme
with<00:03:37.109> your<00:03:37.259> team<00:03:37.500> don't<00:03:38.220> ever<00:03:38.519> change<00:03:39.060> your

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
with your team don't ever change your

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.499 
with your team don't ever change your
wires<00:03:39.780> and<00:03:40.199> I've<00:03:40.859> seen<00:03:41.159> this<00:03:41.400> personally<00:03:42.120> when

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:42.509 
wires and I've seen this personally when

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:45.080 
wires and I've seen this personally when
I<00:03:42.540> was<00:03:42.810> mentoring<00:03:43.199> my<00:03:43.769> school's<00:03:44.220> FLL<00:03:44.849> team

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
I was mentoring my school's FLL team

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.969 
I was mentoring my school's FLL team
this<00:03:45.329> year<00:03:45.389> I've<00:03:46.049> seen<00:03:46.349> this<00:03:46.500> personally

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:46.979 
this year I've seen this personally

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:49.069 
this year I've seen this personally
happen<00:03:47.189> what<00:03:47.790> happens<00:03:48.150> is<00:03:48.329> little<00:03:48.599> Johnny's

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
happen what happens is little Johnny's

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.899 
happen what happens is little Johnny's
making<00:03:49.500> his<00:03:49.590> program<00:03:50.040> and<00:03:50.069> everything<00:03:50.459> and

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:50.909 
making his program and everything and

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.089 
making his program and everything and
then<00:03:51.120> he<00:03:51.209> puts<00:03:51.449> it<00:03:51.569> on<00:03:51.689> the<00:03:52.079> table<00:03:52.319> to<00:03:52.500> test<00:03:52.859> it

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
then he puts it on the table to test it

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.039 
then he puts it on the table to test it
and<00:03:53.310> he<00:03:53.729> sees<00:03:53.969> the<00:03:54.150> robot<00:03:54.449> does<00:03:54.629> pretty<00:03:54.840> much

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
and he sees the robot does pretty much

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.839 
and he sees the robot does pretty much
what<00:03:55.229> he<00:03:55.290> wants<00:03:55.590> it<00:03:55.680> to<00:03:55.799> do<00:03:55.949> except<00:03:56.579> the<00:03:56.669> one

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
what he wants it to do except the one

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.999 
what he wants it to do except the one
thing<00:03:57.060> is<00:03:57.209> it's<00:03:57.389> turning<00:03:57.870> every<00:03:58.169> turn<00:03:58.409> it's

00:03:58.999 --> 00:03:59.009 
thing is it's turning every turn it's

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:01.039 
thing is it's turning every turn it's
making<00:03:59.459> is<00:03:59.609> in<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.150> opposite<00:04:00.569> direction<00:04:00.719> he

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
making is in the opposite direction he

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.080 
making is in the opposite direction he
wants<00:04:01.349> it<00:04:01.439> to<00:04:01.469> go<00:04:01.560> so<00:04:02.129> what<00:04:02.579> he<00:04:02.669> does<00:04:02.849> is<00:04:03.060> he

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
wants it to go so what he does is he

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.119 
wants it to go so what he does is he
takes<00:04:03.209> the<00:04:03.540> motor<00:04:03.780> cables<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.439> he<00:04:04.739> switches

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
takes the motor cables and he switches

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.990 
takes the motor cables and he switches
them<00:04:05.459> around

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
them around

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.479 
them around
so<00:04:06.239> now<00:04:06.359> motor<00:04:06.599> B's<00:04:06.900> motor<00:04:07.229> C<00:04:07.500> motor<00:04:07.799> C's<00:04:08.099> boat

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
so now motor B's motor C motor C's boat

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.270 
so now motor B's motor C motor C's boat
motor<00:04:08.819> B<00:04:09.090> and<00:04:09.389> now<00:04:09.930> his<00:04:10.199> program<00:04:10.650> works<00:04:10.979> and

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
motor B and now his program works and

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.920 
motor B and now his program works and
great<00:04:11.609> little<00:04:11.849> Johnny<00:04:12.150> feels<00:04:12.449> great<00:04:12.689> about

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
great little Johnny feels great about

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.289 
great little Johnny feels great about
himself<00:04:13.079> but<00:04:13.799> now<00:04:14.009> all<00:04:14.370> of<00:04:14.669> the<00:04:14.789> other<00:04:14.969> teams

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
himself but now all of the other teams

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.449 
himself but now all of the other teams
programs<00:04:15.989> don't<00:04:16.289> work<00:04:16.440> because<00:04:17.159> their

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
programs don't work because their

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.390 
programs don't work because their
programs<00:04:18.029> are<00:04:18.419> now<00:04:18.810> going<00:04:19.109> to<00:04:19.229> spin<00:04:19.739> turn<00:04:20.219> in

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
programs are now going to spin turn in

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.519 
programs are now going to spin turn in
the<00:04:20.519> opposite<00:04:20.849> direction<00:04:21.000> so<00:04:21.870> basically<00:04:22.380> the

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:22.529 
the opposite direction so basically the

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:23.240 
the opposite direction so basically the
lesson<00:04:22.710> he

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
lesson he

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.580 
lesson he
is<00:04:23.460> after<00:04:24.420> you've<00:04:24.570> established<00:04:24.750> your<00:04:25.230> wiring

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
is after you've established your wiring

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.470 
is after you've established your wiring
scheme<00:04:25.830> don't<00:04:26.400> change<00:04:26.730> it<00:04:26.940> this<00:04:27.060> pretty<00:04:27.270> much

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
scheme don't change it this pretty much

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.150 
scheme don't change it this pretty much
goes<00:04:27.690> with<00:04:27.930> all<00:04:28.170> of<00:04:28.320> the<00:04:28.470> hardware<00:04:28.920> on<00:04:29.130> your

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
goes with all of the hardware on your

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.220 
goes with all of the hardware on your
robot<00:04:29.700> unless<00:04:30.300> you're<00:04:30.450> expanding<00:04:30.780> upon

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
robot unless you're expanding upon

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.620 
robot unless you're expanding upon
something<00:04:31.530> that's<00:04:31.830> removable<00:04:32.370> and<00:04:32.790> if<00:04:33.510> you

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
something that's removable and if you

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.570 
something that's removable and if you
ever<00:04:33.780> need<00:04:33.930> to<00:04:34.230> change<00:04:34.260> your<00:04:34.890> program<00:04:35.340> for

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
ever need to change your program for

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.180 
ever need to change your program for
anything<00:04:35.850> change<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:36.960> program<00:04:37.470> I<00:04:37.710> mean<00:04:38.070> it

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
anything change the program I mean it

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.040 
anything change the program I mean it
kind<00:04:38.370> of<00:04:38.460> sounds<00:04:38.610> silly<00:04:38.940> but<00:04:39.240> that's<00:04:39.690> just

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
kind of sounds silly but that's just

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.900 
kind of sounds silly but that's just
what<00:04:40.230> you<00:04:40.380> need<00:04:40.560> to<00:04:40.590> do<00:04:40.830> don't<00:04:41.160> change<00:04:41.610> to<00:04:41.820> the

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
what you need to do don't change to the

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.460 
what you need to do don't change to the
hardware<00:04:42.330> because<00:04:42.750> that<00:04:43.050> could<00:04:43.200> have<00:04:43.350> an

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
hardware because that could have an

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.040 
hardware because that could have an
effect<00:04:43.770> on<00:04:43.890> somebody<00:04:44.280> else's<00:04:44.550> machine<00:04:45.050> thanks
