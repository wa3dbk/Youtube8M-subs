00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.270
 Many times it has happened to hurry a portrait and who sees you an eye 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.889
 perfectly focused and the other that scratch a little bit of focus what we're going to 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.770
 do now is to see how we can solve that let's see this image at one hundred 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.499
 for one hundrerd 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:19.960
 we'll go 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.510
 oo the left eye was quite focused and the right eye scratched a 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:24.669
 little by little 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:27.709
 what we are going to do now this removes the background layer 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.000
 smoothed approach 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 to know that the smoothed approach we have quite past laps 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.940
 we are guided more by the eye of the original image than by the little window 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.620
 we see that here we started to lose the image but how are we going to do it? 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.740
 selective way or 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.560
 it gives us a little bit the same 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.660
 and we accept we see that the image is too focused 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.210
 i will create a mask 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.210
 ee invest invest 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.010
 black coat painted white 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.460
 We were going 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.469
 slowly 20 percent 10% opacity 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.010
 and we will also be passing 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.310
 by zones 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.199
 Of the face 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.270
 that is more or less at the same height 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.530
 what would this eye be 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.810
 let's go by let's see that more or less the two eyes are the same 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.140
 focused already 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.580
 those that the image has gained this eye is a little bit darker perhaps 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.550
 then we could make a layer of curves 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.550
 and take it out a little but very carefully always 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.190
 white prince on black cape 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.980
 we are going over it but it is that with care with the eyes that the eyes do not 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.630
 have to sing too much the two eyes of this gentleman who were peace tante 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.080
 nice we were not brown eyes especially they were pretty clear 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.520
 they are a bit of a focus on habits but basically what we have done has been 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.190
 recover the focus of the right eye 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.390
 and that he had gone 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.509
 pal adel fired with a 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.900
 opening too high and having too little depth of field 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.060
 this can be rescued only when this 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.530
 a little defocused to be very focused on moss half a centimeter 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.590
 one eye on the other 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.040
 you can no longer save this is the limit practically is when it starts 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:05.310
 to scratch a little bit 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.030
 here we have another example 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.379
 we have an image 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:11.530
 and to a girl, this image is more fashionable than news 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.420
 and here we can do something else what we could do exposed that no 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.870
 we want to accentuate the defects of the face create a 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:19.890
 copy the background 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.190
 we go to paper and we create again a background copy 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.950
 We were going to filter filters 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.139
 focus 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:29.129
 softened approach when having smoothed approaches 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.209
 we see that we have been quite past, we do not reduce a little bit especially the 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.759
 radio 

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:36.229
 we'll go 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:39.599
 that the image is more focused but that the pores are also more 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.459
 focused 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.749
 thing that does not interest us what we could do would be to create a 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:48.579
 mask invert the mask and with a brush at 10% and expanding a little 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.690
 we could focus our eyes, looking very carefully at the bottom 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:55.169
 of the eyes because we have enough light there 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:56.069
 and we do not have 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.140
 that create a strange effect we focus a little bit the eyes a little 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.309
 the wrinkles but 

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:04.699
 without spending too many demos that has already gained some focus this eyes so 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:08.089
 Poquitos cured we have to be careful with him p 

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:11.760
 and we see how the eye is already a little more focused we can also take a 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:12.429
 bit 

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:16.659
 and here and then what we could do would also be to focus a bit 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.949
 the lips 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:24.249
 those that the sages are quite defined the eyes is also a 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:26.900
 way to focus without touching anything of the face 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:27.540
 not to 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.760
 accentuate the pores that in this style of photography 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.060
 is not correct p with this example pretty much we have seen 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.779
 two types of approach 1 d rescue 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:39.639
 from a little scratching of focus 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.499
 is about to lose focus but still had a little bit recovered 

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:46.450
 to have the same focus that we have in the other eye and then 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.789
 it was simply 

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:51.919
 a more fashionable approach that would be a little bit in the eyes a little bit of the 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:54.049
 several that could be accentuated a little bit more 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:55.739
 but this image does not require it either
