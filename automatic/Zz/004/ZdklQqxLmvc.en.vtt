once that Sun got up it started heating
things<00:01:49.049> up<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.619> would<00:01:50.310> get<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.850> inside<00:01:51.570> of

things up I would get on the inside of

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.690 
things up I would get on the inside of
the<00:01:52.140> eelgrass<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:52.799> I'd<00:01:52.920> go<00:01:53.070> from<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.369> outside

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700
