what<00:05:21.840> any<00:05:22.080> knee<00:05:22.260> but<00:05:23.060> what<00:05:24.060> causes<00:05:24.330> the<00:05:24.600> wheel

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
what any knee but what causes the wheel

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.270 
what any knee but what causes the wheel
off<00:05:25.020> is<00:05:25.200> that<00:05:25.230> the<00:05:25.410> braking<00:05:25.890> is<00:05:26.040> that<00:05:26.160> the

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
off is that the braking is that the

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.010 
off is that the braking is that the
gearing<00:05:26.700> or<00:05:26.760> is<00:05:26.880> it<00:05:26.970> a<00:05:27.060> combination<00:05:27.270> yeah

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
gearing or is it a combination yeah

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.840 
gearing or is it a combination yeah
combination<00:05:28.740> really<00:05:28.890> it<00:05:29.070> can<00:05:29.250> be<00:05:29.400> it<00:05:29.550> can<00:05:29.580> come

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
combination really it can be it can come

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.310 
combination really it can be it can come
from<00:05:29.880> either<00:05:30.180> one<00:05:30.480> you<00:05:30.690> can<00:05:30.840> just<00:05:30.990> get<00:05:31.140> on<00:05:31.230> the

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
from either one you can just get on the

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.960 
from either one you can just get on the
brakes<00:05:31.530> simply<00:05:31.890> to<00:05:32.070> art<00:05:32.280> and<00:05:32.520> have<00:05:32.670> too<00:05:32.850> much

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
brakes simply to art and have too much

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.730 
brakes simply to art and have too much
rear<00:05:33.210> brake<00:05:33.240> in<00:05:33.600> it<00:05:33.720> or<00:05:33.870> as<00:05:34.320> you're<00:05:34.500> getting

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
rear brake in it or as you're getting

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.110 
rear brake in it or as you're getting
down<00:05:34.860> in<00:05:35.070> there<00:05:35.220> you<00:05:35.250> also<00:05:35.520> have<00:05:35.820> to<00:05:35.910> downshift

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
down in there you also have to downshift

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.720 
down in there you also have to downshift
and<00:05:36.630> you<00:05:36.780> don't<00:05:36.990> match<00:05:37.170> up<00:05:37.200> your<00:05:37.530> rpms<00:05:38.100> with

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
and you don't match up your rpms with

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.160 
and you don't match up your rpms with
the<00:05:38.850> rear<00:05:39.000> wheels<00:05:39.180> and<00:05:39.360> it's<00:05:39.450> just<00:05:39.630> too<00:05:40.020> much

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
the rear wheels and it's just too much

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.470 
the rear wheels and it's just too much
speed<00:05:40.500> there<00:05:40.710> so<00:05:40.950> more<00:05:41.610> than<00:05:41.760> either<00:05:41.910> case<00:05:42.240> it

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.480 
speed there so more than either case it

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.030 
speed there so more than either case it
was<00:05:42.600> came<00:05:42.810> too<00:05:43.050> much<00:05:43.200> speed<00:05:43.470> into<00:05:43.710> that<00:05:43.860> corner

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.040 
was came too much speed into that corner

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.640 
was came too much speed into that corner
