hi<00:00:04.380> I'm<00:00:04.590> Ricky<00:00:04.859> Natale<00:00:05.370> I've<00:00:06.300> been<00:00:06.420> playing

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
hi I'm Ricky Natale I've been playing

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.789 
hi I'm Ricky Natale I've been playing
around<00:00:06.750> with<00:00:06.930> HDR<00:00:07.580> ever<00:00:08.580> since<00:00:08.820> I<00:00:08.940> bought<00:00:09.150> my

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:09.799 
around with HDR ever since I bought my

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:14.839 
around with HDR ever since I bought my
nikon<00:00:10.799> d50<00:00:11.340> 100<00:00:11.849> back<00:00:12.059> last<00:00:12.330> summer<00:00:13.820> one<00:00:14.820> of

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
nikon d50 100 back last summer one of

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.519 
nikon d50 100 back last summer one of
the<00:00:14.940> things<00:00:15.090> i've<00:00:15.210> been<00:00:15.240> playing<00:00:16.080> around<00:00:16.259> with

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
the things i've been playing around with

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.499 
the things i've been playing around with
is<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.250> best<00:00:17.430> way<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.610> actually<00:00:17.820> take<00:00:18.330> the

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:18.509 
is the best way to actually take the

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:22.220 
is the best way to actually take the
exposures<00:00:19.820> for<00:00:20.820> HDR<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:21.570> normally<00:00:21.989> want<00:00:22.110> to

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
exposures for HDR you normally want to

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.839 
exposures for HDR you normally want to
take<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.470> series<00:00:23.009> of<00:00:23.040> bracketed<00:00:23.820> exposures

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 
take a series of bracketed exposures

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.760 
take a series of bracketed exposures
usually<00:00:26.849> three<00:00:27.380> sometimes<00:00:28.380> more<00:00:29.930> and<00:00:30.930> I've

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
usually three sometimes more and I've

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.110 
usually three sometimes more and I've
been<00:00:31.919> struggling<00:00:32.189> with<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.460> best<00:00:32.669> way<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.850> set

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
been struggling with the best way to set

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.620 
been struggling with the best way to set
that<00:00:33.270> up<00:00:33.329> for<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.780> D<00:00:34.020> 50-100<00:00:35.270> the<00:00:36.270> define

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
that up for the D 50-100 the define

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.590 
that up for the D 50-100 the define
50-100<00:00:37.440> will<00:00:37.650> take<00:00:38.120> three<00:00:39.120> bracketed

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
50-100 will take three bracketed

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.140 
50-100 will take three bracketed
exposures<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.350> control<00:00:40.830> how<00:00:41.280> much<00:00:41.490> exposure

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
exposures you control how much exposure

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.340 
exposures you control how much exposure
variation<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:42.990> there<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.620> between<00:00:44.040> each<00:00:44.430> one

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
variation is there is between each one

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.780 
variation is there is between each one
normally<00:00:46.350> what<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.560> like<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.890> do<00:00:47.040> is<00:00:47.220> take<00:00:47.430> three

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
normally what I like to do is take three

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.810 
normally what I like to do is take three
exposures<00:00:48.740> one<00:00:49.740> that's<00:00:49.980> two<00:00:50.520> stops

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
exposures one that's two stops

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.060 
exposures one that's two stops
underexposed<00:00:51.630> one<00:00:52.020> that's<00:00:52.200> normally<00:00:52.650> exposed

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
underexposed one that's normally exposed

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.450 
underexposed one that's normally exposed
and<00:00:53.370> one<00:00:53.490> that's<00:00:53.730> two<00:00:54.060> stops<00:00:54.329> overexposed<00:00:55.460> so

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
and one that's two stops overexposed so

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.520 
and one that's two stops overexposed so
the<00:00:56.579> D<00:00:56.700> 50-100<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.360> can<00:00:57.510> set<00:00:57.720> that<00:00:57.870> up<00:00:57.930> fairly

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
the D 50-100 you can set that up fairly

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.650 
the D 50-100 you can set that up fairly
easily<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:59.520> just<00:00:59.730> turn<00:01:00.060> on<00:01:00.180> auto<00:01:00.360> bracketing

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
easily you just turn on auto bracketing

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.200 
easily you just turn on auto bracketing
and<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.649> say<00:01:01.860> to<00:01:01.920> make<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.430> stop<00:01:02.700> or<00:01:03.000> to

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
and you say to make a to stop or to

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.690 
and you say to make a to stop or to
exposure<00:01:03.600> or<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:04.019> exposure<00:01:04.350> value<00:01:04.769> difference

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
exposure or to exposure value difference

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.540 
exposure or to exposure value difference
between<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.149> exposures<00:01:07.190> but<00:01:08.190> what<00:01:08.370> I've<00:01:08.460> been

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
between the exposures but what I've been

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.610 
between the exposures but what I've been
struggling<00:01:08.880> with<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.659> helped<00:01:10.290> us<00:01:10.470> actually

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
struggling with is helped us actually

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.810 
struggling with is helped us actually
then<00:01:10.979> take<00:01:11.340> those<00:01:11.550> pictures<00:01:13.250> at<00:01:14.250> first<00:01:14.550> I<00:01:14.700> had

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
then take those pictures at first I had

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.940 
then take those pictures at first I had
thought<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.930> would<00:01:16.110> just<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.740> know<00:01:16.770> if

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
thought that it would just you know if

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.160 
thought that it would just you know if
you<00:01:17.040> set<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.400> up<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:18.450> hit<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.720> button<00:01:19.049> that

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
you set that up you hit the button that

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.020 
you set that up you hit the button that
would<00:01:19.350> take<00:01:19.530> three<00:01:19.710> exposures<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.400> stop<00:01:20.700> it

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
would take three exposures and stop it

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.750 
would take three exposures and stop it
doesn't<00:01:21.210> work<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.810> way

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
doesn't work that way

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.920 
doesn't work that way
normally<00:01:23.760> what<00:01:23.909> will<00:01:23.970> happen<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.479> it'll<00:01:24.690> take

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
normally what will happen is it'll take

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.700 
normally what will happen is it'll take
one<00:01:25.200> exposure<00:01:26.450> at<00:01:27.450> one<00:01:27.870> of<00:01:27.960> one<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.560> three

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
one exposure at one of one of the three

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.920 
one exposure at one of one of the three
exposures<00:01:29.280> then<00:01:29.850> wait<00:01:30.060> for<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.510> press<00:01:30.750> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
exposures then wait for you to press the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.960 
exposures then wait for you to press the
shutter<00:01:31.080> release<00:01:31.229> again<00:01:31.830> it<00:01:32.610> takes<00:01:32.820> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
shutter release again it takes the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.620 
shutter release again it takes the
second<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.659> then<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.930> third<00:01:35.420> that's<00:01:36.420> a

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
second and then the third that's a

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.500 
second and then the third that's a
little<00:01:36.869> inconvenient<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:38.520> other<00:01:38.729> problem

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
little inconvenient the other problem

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.240 
little inconvenient the other problem
I've<00:01:39.659> had<00:01:39.840> with<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.080> is<00:01:40.440> that<00:01:40.470> sometimes

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
I've had with that is that sometimes

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.830 
I've had with that is that sometimes
I'll<00:01:41.400> forget<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.060> put<00:01:42.330> the<00:01:42.420> camera<00:01:42.600> in

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
I'll forget that I put the camera in

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.320 
I'll forget that I put the camera in
auto<00:01:43.110> bracketing<00:01:43.409> mode<00:01:43.970> and<00:01:44.970> then<00:01:45.119> I'll<00:01:45.180> be

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
auto bracketing mode and then I'll be

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.230 
auto bracketing mode and then I'll be
taking<00:01:45.690> normal<00:01:46.020> normal<00:01:46.619> shots<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.220> I'll<00:01:47.310> be

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
taking normal normal shots and I'll be

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.450 
taking normal normal shots and I'll be
confused<00:01:48.810> because<00:01:49.020> I'm<00:01:49.799> getting<00:01:50.340> very

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
confused because I'm getting very

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.760 
confused because I'm getting very
inconsistent<00:01:51.119> exposures<00:01:51.869> until<00:01:52.260> I<00:01:52.290> realized

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
inconsistent exposures until I realized

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.300 
inconsistent exposures until I realized
that<00:01:53.040> every<00:01:53.790> third<00:01:54.750> exposure<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.740> normal

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
that every third exposure is normal

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.270 
that every third exposure is normal
every<00:01:57.000> third<00:01:57.299> exposure<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:58.110> overexposed<00:01:59.010> and

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
every third exposure is overexposed and

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.560 
every third exposure is overexposed and
every<00:01:59.460> third<00:01:59.790> exposure<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.530> underexposed

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
every third exposure is underexposed

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.330 
every third exposure is underexposed
so<00:02:03.570> I've<00:02:03.720> tried<00:02:04.020> with<00:02:04.229> various<00:02:04.619> modes<00:02:04.950> are

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
so I've tried with various modes are

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.490 
so I've tried with various modes are
trying<00:02:05.580> to<00:02:05.670> various<00:02:06.479> modes<00:02:06.720> to<00:02:06.930> try<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.229> get<00:02:07.409> it

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
trying to various modes to try to get it

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.949 
trying to various modes to try to get it
to<00:02:07.590> just<00:02:07.740> take<00:02:08.099> three<00:02:08.369> exposures<00:02:09.000> we<00:02:09.450> take<00:02:09.840> the

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
to just take three exposures we take the

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.080 
to just take three exposures we take the
bracketing<00:02:10.409> sequence<00:02:10.799> and

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
bracketing sequence and

you<00:02:38.840> need<00:02:39.050> to<00:02:39.080> set<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:40.209> dial<00:02:41.209> to<00:02:41.750> delayed

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
you need to set the the dial to delayed

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.340 
you need to set the the dial to delayed
exposures<00:02:43.220> which<00:02:43.489> didn't<00:02:43.910> make<00:02:44.000> sense<00:02:44.390> for

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
exposures which didn't make sense for

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.710 
exposures which didn't make sense for
the<00:02:45.440> d50<00:02:45.860> 100<00:02:46.400> because<00:02:46.670> there<00:02:46.850> is<00:02:46.970> no<00:02:47.150> dial

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720

setting for for delayed exposure but I

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.690 
setting for for delayed exposure but I
decided<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.440> look<00:02:54.590> a<00:02:54.709> little<00:02:54.830> bit<00:02:55.040> more<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.640> I

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
decided to look a little bit more and I

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.420 
decided to look a little bit more and I
think<00:02:56.030> I<00:02:56.150> figured<00:02:56.209> out<00:02:56.630> how<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:56.930> do<00:02:57.260> it<00:02:57.440> first

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
think I figured out how to do it first

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.059 
think I figured out how to do it first
let<00:02:58.700> me<00:02:58.819> demonstrate<00:02:59.030> and<00:02:59.780> the<00:02:59.870> way<00:02:59.989> the<00:03:00.950> way

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
let me demonstrate and the way the way

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.610 
let me demonstrate and the way the way
the<00:03:01.220> camera<00:03:01.459> works<00:03:03.130> or<00:03:04.130> has<00:03:04.310> been<00:03:04.519> working

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
the camera works or has been working

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.610 
the camera works or has been working
normally<00:03:06.620> for<00:03:07.010> auto<00:03:07.160> bracketing<00:03:08.200> okay<00:03:09.200> so<00:03:09.260> now

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
normally for auto bracketing okay so now

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.100 
normally for auto bracketing okay so now
what<00:03:09.890> I've<00:03:10.040> done<00:03:10.069> is<00:03:10.280> I've<00:03:10.580> got<00:03:10.819> the<00:03:11.110> I'm

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
where I can change settings now first of

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.370 
where I can change settings now first of
all<00:03:32.930> you'll<00:03:33.140> notice<00:03:33.200> that<00:03:33.859> I've<00:03:34.190> got<00:03:35.380> the

all you'll notice that I've got the

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.670 
all you'll notice that I've got the

bracketing set for auto exposure to
stops<00:03:39.980> between<00:03:40.329> exposures<00:03:43.299> let<00:03:44.299> me<00:03:44.359> show<00:03:44.600> you

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
stops between exposures let me show you

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.420 
stops between exposures let me show you
how<00:03:44.930> I've<00:03:45.079> set<00:03:45.319> that<00:03:45.560> up<00:03:45.590> I've<00:03:46.040> got<00:03:48.190> I've<00:03:49.190> got

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
how I've set that up I've got I've got

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.910 
how I've set that up I've got I've got
the<00:03:49.850> function<00:03:50.359> button<00:03:50.720> if<00:03:51.139> I<00:03:51.290> can<00:03:51.470> find<00:03:51.709> it

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
the function button if I can find it

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.920 
the function button if I can find it
without<00:03:51.980> looking<00:03:53.319> set<00:03:54.319> up<00:03:54.530> to<00:03:55.340> be<00:03:56.090> bracketing

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
without looking set up to be bracketing

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.150 
without looking set up to be bracketing
and<00:03:57.170> then<00:03:57.709> I<00:03:57.799> can<00:03:58.040> use<00:03:58.310> the<00:03:58.579> I<00:03:59.859> can<00:04:00.859> use<00:04:01.010> the

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
and then I can use the I can use the

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.720 
and then I can use the I can use the
thumb<00:04:01.489> wheel<00:04:01.900> to<00:04:02.900> switch<00:04:04.299> how<00:04:05.299> many<00:04:05.480> stops<00:04:06.730> so

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
thumb wheel to switch how many stops so

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.970 
thumb wheel to switch how many stops so
and<00:04:08.120> it's<00:04:08.209> very<00:04:08.389> nice<00:04:08.540> if<00:04:08.720> I<00:04:08.810> if<00:04:09.109> I<00:04:09.260> turn<00:04:09.829> the

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
and it's very nice if I if I turn the

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.470 
and it's very nice if I if I turn the
thumb<00:04:10.130> wheel<00:04:10.310> one<00:04:10.579> direction<00:04:11.060> it'll<00:04:11.299> just

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
thumb wheel one direction it'll just

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.750 
thumb wheel one direction it'll just
turn<00:04:11.630> it<00:04:11.780> on<00:04:11.900> or<00:04:12.620> turn<00:04:12.739> it<00:04:12.889> off<00:04:13.040> rather<00:04:13.400> and

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
turn it on or turn it off rather and

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.430 
turn it on or turn it off rather and
then<00:04:13.850> toggle<00:04:14.120> back<00:04:14.480> to<00:04:14.660> 2<00:04:14.900> which<00:04:15.139> is<00:04:15.260> what<00:04:15.410> I

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
then toggle back to 2 which is what I

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.810 
then toggle back to 2 which is what I
normally<00:04:15.530> use<00:04:15.920> you<00:04:16.250> can<00:04:16.430> select<00:04:16.989> other

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
normally use you can select other

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.039 
normally use you can select other
bracketing<00:04:19.820> different<00:04:20.419> or<00:04:20.570> bracketing

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
bracketing different or bracketing

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.040 
bracketing different or bracketing
ranges<00:04:21.830> I<00:04:21.979> guess

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
ranges I guess

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.540 
ranges I guess
okay<00:04:24.379> so<00:04:24.440> getting<00:04:24.740> back<00:04:24.979> to<00:04:25.039> this<00:04:25.490> hit<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:27.550> the

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
okay so getting back to this hit the the

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.070 
okay so getting back to this hit the the
information<00:04:28.849> button<00:04:29.330> again<00:04:29.720> and<00:04:29.900> I'm<00:04:29.990> going

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
information button again and I'm going

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.480 
information button again and I'm going
to<00:04:30.139> scroll<00:04:30.410> up<00:04:30.470> and<00:04:30.889> you'll<00:04:30.979> see<00:04:31.069> that<00:04:31.370> I've

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
to scroll up and you'll see that I've

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.230 
to scroll up and you'll see that I've
got<00:04:31.729> the<00:04:31.940> release<00:04:32.240> mode<00:04:32.539> set<00:04:32.930> to<00:04:32.960> single<00:04:33.650> shot

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
got the release mode set to single shot

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.760 
got the release mode set to single shot
so<00:04:35.240> now<00:04:35.360> let<00:04:35.569> me<00:04:35.599> take<00:04:35.840> a<00:04:35.900> series<00:04:36.289> of<00:04:36.440> exposures

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
so now let me take a series of exposures

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:37.930 
so now let me take a series of exposures
and<00:04:37.099> I'll<00:04:37.190> show<00:04:37.310> you<00:04:37.400> how<00:04:37.520> this<00:04:37.669> camera

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
and I'll show you how this camera

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.820 
and I'll show you how this camera
normally<00:04:38.150> works<00:04:38.599> so<00:04:39.440> I'm<00:04:39.500> gonna<00:04:39.590> hit<00:04:39.710> the

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
normally works so I'm gonna hit the

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.119 
normally works so I'm gonna hit the
shuttle<00:04:40.129> shutter<00:04:40.520> button<00:04:40.819> once<00:04:41.919> takes<00:04:42.919> one

00:04:43.119 --> 00:04:43.129 
shuttle shutter button once takes one

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:47.170 
shuttle shutter button once takes one
exposure<00:04:44.080> I'd<00:04:45.080> hit<00:04:45.259> it<00:04:45.289> again<00:04:45.680> it<00:04:46.180> takes

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
exposure I'd hit it again it takes

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.850 
exposure I'd hit it again it takes
another<00:04:47.479> exposure<00:04:49.900> and<00:04:50.900> I<00:04:50.990> hit<00:04:51.110> it<00:04:51.199> again<00:04:51.560> and

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
another exposure and I hit it again and

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.490 
another exposure and I hit it again and
it<00:04:52.849> takes<00:04:53.060> the<00:04:53.210> third<00:04:53.389> exposure<00:04:53.870> and<00:04:54.110> each<00:04:54.199> one

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
it takes the third exposure and each one

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:04.270 
it takes the third exposure and each one
of<00:04:54.530> those<00:04:55.930> would<00:04:56.930> be<00:04:58.810> bracketed<00:05:02.020> okay<00:05:03.220> so<00:05:04.220> you

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
of those would be bracketed okay so you

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.600 
of those would be bracketed okay so you
have<00:05:04.729> to<00:05:04.759> remember<00:05:05.210> to<00:05:05.630> take<00:05:06.250> the<00:05:07.250> multiple

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
have to remember to take the multiple

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.159 
have to remember to take the multiple
exposures<00:05:08.210> you<00:05:08.360> also<00:05:08.509> have<00:05:08.630> to<00:05:08.720> remember<00:05:08.930> to

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
exposures you also have to remember to

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.980 
exposures you also have to remember to
take<00:05:09.319> the<00:05:09.470> camera<00:05:09.800> out<00:05:09.919> of<00:05:10.389> auto<00:05:11.389> bracket<00:05:11.840> mode

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
take the camera out of auto bracket mode

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.439 
take the camera out of auto bracket mode
when<00:05:12.199> you<00:05:12.289> go<00:05:12.440> to<00:05:12.500> taking<00:05:13.039> regular<00:05:13.460> single

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:14.449 
when you go to taking regular single

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:17.260 
when you go to taking regular single
exposures<00:05:15.219> so<00:05:16.219> now<00:05:16.400> I'm<00:05:16.550> going<00:05:16.669> to<00:05:16.759> show<00:05:16.969> how<00:05:17.240> I

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
exposures so now I'm going to show how I

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.510 
exposures so now I'm going to show how I
set<00:05:17.719> it<00:05:17.870> up<00:05:17.990> using<00:05:18.650> the<00:05:18.770> combination<00:05:19.370> of

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
set it up using the combination of

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.110 
set it up using the combination of
delayed<00:05:20.020> shutter<00:05:21.020> release<00:05:21.580> which<00:05:22.580> seems<00:05:22.940> to

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
delayed shutter release which seems to

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.420 
delayed shutter release which seems to
do<00:05:23.300> the<00:05:23.330> trick<00:05:23.479> so<00:05:24.159> here's<00:05:25.159> what<00:05:25.310> I<00:05:25.340> found

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
do the trick so here's what I found

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.209 
do the trick so here's what I found
today<00:05:26.229> based<00:05:27.229> on<00:05:27.440> the<00:05:27.530> comment<00:05:27.949> that<00:05:28.039> was<00:05:28.159> made

00:05:28.209 --> 00:05:28.219 
today based on the comment that was made

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:34.029 
today based on the comment that was made
on<00:05:29.020> entrees<00:05:32.229> forums<00:05:33.229> so<00:05:33.349> I'm<00:05:33.409> gonna<00:05:33.530> now<00:05:33.889> I'm

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 
on entrees forums so I'm gonna now I'm

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:38.200 
on entrees forums so I'm gonna now I'm
gonna<00:05:34.419> change<00:05:35.419> the<00:05:35.719> release<00:05:36.080> mode<00:05:36.349> and<00:05:37.219> I'm

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
gonna change the release mode and I'm

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.480 
gonna change the release mode and I'm
going<00:05:38.330> to<00:05:38.360> change<00:05:38.630> it<00:05:38.750> to<00:05:38.780> 10-second<00:05:39.680> delay

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:48.370 

so<00:05:43.490> now<00:05:43.699> when<00:05:43.940> I<00:05:43.969> take<00:05:44.210> the<00:05:44.419> exposure<00:05:47.380> I'm

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
so now when I take the exposure I'm

00:05:48.380 --> 00:06:04.339 
so now when I take the exposure I'm
giving<00:05:48.710> the<00:05:48.800> 10-second<00:05:49.340> delay

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:04.349 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:07.740 

so<00:06:05.349> I<00:06:05.379> get<00:06:05.620> a<00:06:05.650> long<00:06:05.979> 10<00:06:06.340> second<00:06:06.729> pause<00:06:06.909> and<00:06:07.449> then

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
so I get a long 10 second pause and then

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:13.800 
so I get a long 10 second pause and then
short<00:06:08.020> pauses<00:06:08.259> between<00:06:08.590> each<00:06:09.009> exposure<00:06:10.979> so<00:06:12.810> in

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
short pauses between each exposure so in

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.270 
short pauses between each exposure so in
this<00:06:13.990> mode<00:06:14.289> you'll<00:06:14.590> notice<00:06:14.949> that<00:06:15.099> it<00:06:15.250> just

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
this mode you'll notice that it just

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.110 
this mode you'll notice that it just
takes<00:06:15.729> three<00:06:16.030> exposures<00:06:16.650> you<00:06:17.849> have<00:06:18.849> to<00:06:18.939> wait

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 
takes three exposures you have to wait

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.659 
takes three exposures you have to wait
10<00:06:19.360> seconds<00:06:19.750> for<00:06:19.930> the<00:06:20.020> first<00:06:20.259> one<00:06:20.560> you<00:06:21.460> have<00:06:21.550> to

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669 
10 seconds for the first one you have to

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:23.730 
10 seconds for the first one you have to
wait<00:06:21.819> a<00:06:21.849> second<00:06:22.300> or<00:06:22.419> so<00:06:22.569> between<00:06:22.930> the<00:06:23.319> second

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
wait a second or so between the second

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.499 
wait a second or so between the second
first<00:06:24.400> in<00:06:24.550> the<00:06:24.610> second<00:06:24.909> and<00:06:25.000> the<00:06:25.060> second<00:06:25.389> and

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:25.509 
first in the second and the second and

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:30.779 
first in the second and the second and
the<00:06:25.539> third<00:06:26.759> which<00:06:27.759> is<00:06:27.940> nice<00:06:29.219> now<00:06:30.219> I<00:06:30.250> would

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:30.789 
the third which is nice now I would

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:33.200 
the third which is nice now I would
prefer<00:06:31.330> it<00:06:31.539> if<00:06:31.569> I<00:06:31.930> can<00:06:32.110> actually<00:06:32.289> do<00:06:32.860> this

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
prefer it if I can actually do this

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.559 
prefer it if I can actually do this
using<00:06:34.210> the<00:06:34.389> remote<00:06:34.810> shutter<00:06:35.469> release<00:06:36.569> the

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:37.569 
using the remote shutter release the

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:40.290 
using the remote shutter release the
camera<00:06:37.900> does<00:06:38.110> have<00:06:38.319> a<00:06:38.349> mode<00:06:38.680> for<00:06:39.210> either<00:06:40.210> a

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.300 
camera does have a mode for either a

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.869 
camera does have a mode for either a
immediate<00:06:41.129> remote<00:06:42.129> shutter<00:06:42.340> release<00:06:42.400> or<00:06:42.849> a

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:42.879 
immediate remote shutter release or a

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:46.290 
immediate remote shutter release or a
two-second<00:06:43.599> delay<00:06:43.719> release<00:06:45.300> unfortunately

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
two-second delay release unfortunately

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.939 
two-second delay release unfortunately
neither<00:06:46.539> one<00:06:46.810> of<00:06:46.840> those<00:06:47.050> seems<00:06:47.379> to<00:06:47.560> do<00:06:47.740> this

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:47.949 
neither one of those seems to do this

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:50.730 
neither one of those seems to do this
job<00:06:48.250> but<00:06:48.909> in<00:06:49.120> year<00:06:49.690> of<00:06:49.840> those<00:06:49.990> modes<00:06:50.289> it<00:06:50.500> seems

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740 
job but in year of those modes it seems

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.070 
job but in year of those modes it seems
to<00:06:50.860> just<00:06:51.009> take<00:06:51.219> one<00:06:51.550> exposure<00:06:51.969> in<00:06:52.449> the<00:06:52.629> bracket

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.080 
to just take one exposure in the bracket

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.600 
to just take one exposure in the bracket
for<00:06:53.259> each<00:06:53.409> activation<00:06:53.949> of<00:06:54.219> the<00:06:54.340> remote

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.610 
for each activation of the remote

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.379 
for each activation of the remote
shutter<00:06:54.879> release<00:06:55.500> but<00:06:56.500> I<00:06:56.529> think<00:06:56.919> this<00:06:57.460> this

00:06:58.379 --> 00:06:58.389 
shutter release but I think this this

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:01.469 
shutter release but I think this this
technique<00:06:58.900> of<00:06:59.229> using<00:06:59.289> the<00:07:00.009> the<00:07:00.120> 10<00:07:01.120> second

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:01.479 
technique of using the the 10 second

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:05.010 
technique of using the the 10 second
delay<00:07:01.509> with<00:07:01.990> the<00:07:03.029> with<00:07:04.029> with<00:07:04.509> the<00:07:04.659> regular

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:05.020 
delay with the with with the regular

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.290 
delay with the with with the regular
shutter<00:07:05.259> release<00:07:05.650> button<00:07:05.680> I<00:07:06.340> think<00:07:07.180> that's

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:07.300 
shutter release button I think that's

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.519 
shutter release button I think that's
probably<00:07:07.539> going<00:07:07.840> to<00:07:07.960> be<00:07:08.050> the<00:07:08.139> way<00:07:08.259> that<00:07:08.409> I'm

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:08.529 
probably going to be the way that I'm
