hello ello people today I'm going to do
something<00:00:02.879> a<00:00:03.120> little<00:00:03.149> bit<00:00:03.449> different<00:00:04.020> and

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
something a little bit different and

something a little bit different and
show<00:00:04.620> you<00:00:04.680> a<00:00:04.890> model<00:00:05.190> that<00:00:05.370> I've<00:00:05.460> been<00:00:05.609> playing

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
show you a model that I've been playing

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.760 
show you a model that I've been playing
lately<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.420> mod<00:00:06.600> is<00:00:06.750> called<00:00:06.990> plasma<00:00:07.500> craft

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
lately the mod is called plasma craft

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.190 
lately the mod is called plasma craft
and<00:00:07.980> what<00:00:08.880> you<00:00:09.000> can<00:00:09.150> do<00:00:09.240> in<00:00:09.389> plasma<00:00:09.719> craft<00:00:10.019> is

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
and what you can do in plasma craft is

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.900 
and what you can do in plasma craft is
basically<00:00:10.710> collect<00:00:11.070> these<00:00:11.280> different<00:00:11.730> types

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
basically collect these different types

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.990 
basically collect these different types
of<00:00:12.059> liquids<00:00:12.540> that<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:12.840> find<00:00:13.580> laying<00:00:14.580> around

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
of liquids that you find laying around

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.930 
of liquids that you find laying around
and<00:00:15.210> caves<00:00:15.570> or<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.859> different<00:00:17.340> orders<00:00:17.730> that

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
and caves or the different orders that

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.870 
and caves or the different orders that
you<00:00:18.060> can<00:00:18.270> get<00:00:18.779> in<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.109> nether<00:00:19.350> in<00:00:19.529> caves<00:00:19.880> but

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
you can get in the nether in caves but

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.870 
you can get in the nether in caves but
the<00:00:21.359> only<00:00:21.570> useful<00:00:21.869> one<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:23.100> green<00:00:23.369> one<00:00:23.580> the

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
the only useful one is the green one the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.050 
the only useful one is the green one the
acid<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:25.350> basically<00:00:25.949> can't<00:00:26.550> do<00:00:26.760> anything

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
acid you basically can't do anything

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.000 
acid you basically can't do anything
with<00:00:27.480> any<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.930> other<00:00:28.080> ones<00:00:28.140> but<00:00:28.560> i'm<00:00:28.980> sure

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
with any of the other ones but i'm sure

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.429 
with any of the other ones but i'm sure
that<00:00:29.550> eventually<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.449> model<00:00:30.869> have<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.230> where

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
that eventually the model have it where

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.440 
that eventually the model have it where
you<00:00:31.560> can<00:00:31.590> use<00:00:31.769> basically<00:00:32.640> all<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:33.059> them<00:00:33.180> for

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
you can use basically all of them for

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.180 
you can use basically all of them for
something<00:00:34.190> but<00:00:35.190> yep<00:00:36.149> let's<00:00:36.480> go<00:00:36.690> with<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:37.829> the

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
something but yep let's go with this the

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.880 
something but yep let's go with this the
reinforced<00:00:38.790> glass<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.930> first<00:00:40.379> item<00:00:40.739> that

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
reinforced glass is the first item that

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.330 
reinforced glass is the first item that
you<00:00:40.980> will<00:00:41.070> be<00:00:41.100> able<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.489> make<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:43.190> you<00:00:44.190> will

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
you will be able to make and you will

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.310 
you will be able to make and you will
need<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.760> put<00:00:45.000> an<00:00:45.180> iron<00:00:45.390> ingot<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:45.870> top<00:00:46.079> and

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
need to put an iron ingot on top and

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.470 
need to put an iron ingot on top and
glass<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.770> bottom<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.270> then<00:00:48.270> with<00:00:48.450> that

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
glass on bottom and then with that

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.090 
glass on bottom and then with that
reinforced<00:00:49.230> glass<00:00:49.350> you're<00:00:49.680> going<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.950> need<00:00:50.070> to

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
reinforced glass you're going to need to

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.459 
reinforced glass you're going to need to
make<00:00:50.340> an<00:00:50.460> empty<00:00:50.820> vial<00:00:51.090> because<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.199> have<00:00:52.230> to

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
make an empty vial because you have to

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.139 
make an empty vial because you have to
carry<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.890> acids<00:00:53.250> with<00:00:53.370> empty<00:00:53.670> vials<00:00:54.030> you

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
carry the acids with empty vials you

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.660 
carry the acids with empty vials you
can't<00:00:54.390> carry<00:00:54.629> them<00:00:54.870> with<00:00:55.110> buckets<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.370> turns

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
can't carry them with buckets it turns

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.360 
can't carry them with buckets it turns
it<00:00:56.820> into<00:00:56.940> water<00:00:57.180> if<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.570> try<00:00:57.890> so<00:00:58.890> yeah<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.219> does

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
it into water if you try so yeah it does

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.299 
it into water if you try so yeah it does
don't<00:00:59.640> do<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.879> unless<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.750> want<00:01:00.960> some<00:01:01.079> water

don't do it unless you want some water
then<00:01:02.309> do<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:03.390> why<00:01:03.570> would<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.809> want<00:01:03.989> water

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
then do it but why would you want water

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.620 
then do it but why would you want water
when<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.769> could<00:01:04.890> have<00:01:04.920> green<00:01:05.250> acid<00:01:05.630> just

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
when you could have green acid just

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.149 
when you could have green acid just
saying<00:01:07.790> but<00:01:08.990> yep<00:01:09.990> that's<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.590> need<00:01:10.799> empty

ingots I mean on the bottom and top yep

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.950 
ingots I mean on the bottom and top yep
and<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.400> next<00:01:26.580> item<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.420> plasma<00:01:27.780> for

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
and the next item is the plasma for

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.260 
and the next item is the plasma for
cater<00:01:28.140> which<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.530> need<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.950> get<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.549> plasma

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
cater which you need to get the plasma

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.350 
cater which you need to get the plasma
out<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> Radian<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.140> tours<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.770> the

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
out of the Radian I tours and the

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.230 
out of the Radian I tours and the
plutonium<00:01:33.360> or<00:01:34.400> that's<00:01:35.400> based<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:36.060> is

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
plutonium or that's based this is

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.670 
plutonium or that's based this is
basically<00:01:36.659> what<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:36.930> should<00:01:37.200> look<00:01:37.229> like<00:01:37.439> when

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680

caters<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.840> fuel<00:01:58.619> for<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.130> so<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:01.049> next

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
caters to the fuel for it so the next

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.999 
caters to the fuel for it so the next
thing<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:02.869> purple<00:02:03.869> glow<00:02:04.049> cloth<00:02:04.290> which<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.710> easy

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
thing is purple glow cloth which is easy

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.670 
thing is purple glow cloth which is easy
to<00:02:05.070> make<00:02:05.310> after<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.180> get<00:02:06.479> your<00:02:06.780> radio<00:02:07.469> night

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
to make after you get your radio night

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.059 
to make after you get your radio night
or<00:02:07.860> in<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.369> plasma<00:02:08.729> ficarra<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.590> you<00:02:10.590> extract

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
or in the plasma ficarra and you extract

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.130 
or in the plasma ficarra and you extract
it<00:02:11.370> in

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
it in

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.990 
it in
with<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.319> goop<00:02:12.530> and<00:02:12.710> put<00:02:13.010> it<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.340> goop<00:02:13.550> into<00:02:13.819> a

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
with the goop and put it the goop into a

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.660 
with the goop and put it the goop into a
vial<00:02:14.390> or<00:02:14.830> no<00:02:15.830> you<00:02:15.890> don't<00:02:16.069> put<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.400> group<00:02:16.550> in

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
vial or no you don't put the group in

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.010 
vial or no you don't put the group in
the<00:02:16.730> vial<00:02:16.910> don't<00:02:17.150> do<00:02:17.270> that<00:02:17.450> don't<00:02:17.660> do<00:02:17.990> that

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
the vial don't do that don't do that

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.940 
the vial don't do that don't do that
because<00:02:18.319> that<00:02:18.440> you<00:02:18.680> will<00:02:18.850> ruin<00:02:19.850> it<00:02:20.090> all<00:02:20.950> what

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
because that you will ruin it all what

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.080 
because that you will ruin it all what
you<00:02:22.100> want<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:22.370> do<00:02:22.459> is<00:02:22.610> you<00:02:22.640> want<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:22.880> get<00:02:23.000> the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
you want to do is you want to get the

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.970 
you want to do is you want to get the
plasma<00:02:23.450> group<00:02:23.600> and<00:02:24.610> put<00:02:25.610> it<00:02:25.730> under<00:02:26.290> some<00:02:27.290> cloth

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
plasma group and put it under some cloth

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.110 
plasma group and put it under some cloth
and<00:02:28.310> then<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.300> get<00:02:29.510> glow<00:02:29.810> cloth<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:31.120> there

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
and then you get glow cloth and there

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.670 
and then you get glow cloth and there
are<00:02:32.300> two<00:02:32.450> different<00:02:32.750> colors<00:02:33.020> purple<00:02:33.410> and

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
are two different colors purple and

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.640 
are two different colors purple and
green<00:02:33.860> I<00:02:34.130> prefer<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.760> green<00:02:34.970> one<00:02:35.530> but<00:02:36.530> you

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
green I prefer the green one but you

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.410 
green I prefer the green one but you
know<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:37.280> radio<00:02:37.550> not<00:02:37.730> has<00:02:37.880> to<00:02:37.910> be<00:02:38.120> useful<00:02:38.239> for

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
know the radio not has to be useful for

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.300 
know the radio not has to be useful for
something<00:02:38.750> but<00:02:39.080> well<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.650> radio<00:02:39.890> night<00:02:40.100> is

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
something but well the radio night is

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.430 
something but well the radio night is
useful<00:02:40.910> for<00:02:40.940> one<00:02:41.180> other<00:02:41.360> thing<00:02:41.569> the<00:02:42.140> radio

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
useful for one other thing the radio

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.229 
useful for one other thing the radio
night<00:02:42.620> boat<00:02:42.890> which<00:02:43.160> is<00:02:43.310> made<00:02:43.610> just<00:02:43.970> like<00:02:44.120> a

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
night boat which is made just like a

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.010 
night boat which is made just like a
regular<00:02:44.540> boat<00:02:44.900> as<00:02:45.110> you<00:02:45.830> can<00:02:45.950> see<00:02:46.130> here<00:02:47.020> then

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
regular boat as you can see here then

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.630 
regular boat as you can see here then
that's<00:02:48.320> pretty<00:02:48.530> much<00:02:48.709> that<00:02:48.980> is<00:02:49.160> all<00:02:49.430> that<00:02:49.459> you

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
that's pretty much that is all that you

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.710 
that's pretty much that is all that you
can<00:02:49.760> make<00:02:49.910> you<00:02:49.970> late<00:02:50.150> at<00:02:50.209> night<00:02:50.390> let's

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
can make you late at night let's

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.440 
can make you late at night let's
continue<00:02:51.050> with<00:02:51.410> how<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.070> make<00:02:52.489> plasma<00:02:53.000> to<00:02:53.269> make

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
continue with how to make plasma to make

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.040 
continue with how to make plasma to make
plasma<00:02:53.959> it's<00:02:54.519> just<00:02:55.519> like<00:02:55.610> this<00:02:56.209> you<00:02:56.570> just<00:02:56.810> put

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
plasma it's just like this you just put

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.920 
plasma it's just like this you just put
the<00:02:57.830> plasma<00:02:58.250> goop<00:02:58.489> as<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:59.470> fuel<00:03:00.470> and<00:03:00.739> as<00:03:01.250> the

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
the plasma goop as the fuel and as the

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
the plasma goop as the fuel and as the
resource<00:03:02.930> that<00:03:03.080> you<00:03:03.140> want<00:03:03.350> to<00:03:03.410> refine<00:03:03.680> and

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
resource that you want to refine and

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.540 
resource that you want to refine and
then<00:03:04.700> you<00:03:04.790> make<00:03:04.970> plasma<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:06.220> plasma<00:03:07.220> can<00:03:07.400> be

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
then you make plasma and plasma can be

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.970 
then you make plasma and plasma can be
used<00:03:07.850> as<00:03:08.150> a<00:03:08.360> longer-lasting<00:03:08.780> fuel<00:03:09.500> I<00:03:09.530> believe

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
used as a longer-lasting fuel I believe

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.920 
used as a longer-lasting fuel I believe
in<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.160> plasma<00:03:10.340> fire<00:03:10.730> I<00:03:10.880> didn't<00:03:11.180> I<00:03:11.360> haven't

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
in the plasma fire I didn't I haven't

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.170 
in the plasma fire I didn't I haven't
used<00:03:12.110> it<00:03:12.320> yet<00:03:12.350> but<00:03:12.709> i<00:03:12.769> think<00:03:13.130> it<00:03:13.250> is<00:03:13.280> it<00:03:13.970> would

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
used it yet but i think it is it would

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.289 
used it yet but i think it is it would
make<00:03:14.360> sense<00:03:14.420> and<00:03:15.250> it<00:03:16.250> is<00:03:16.430> stackable<00:03:16.850> unlike

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
make sense and it is stackable unlike

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.180 
make sense and it is stackable unlike
the<00:03:17.480> plasma<00:03:17.900> goop<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.440> plasma<00:03:18.799> group<00:03:18.950> is<00:03:19.070> not

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
the plasma goop the plasma group is not

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.830 
the plasma goop the plasma group is not
stackable<00:03:20.019> and<00:03:21.640> let's<00:03:22.640> see<00:03:22.820> and<00:03:23.120> with<00:03:23.390> plasma

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
stackable and let's see and with plasma

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.690 
stackable and let's see and with plasma
you<00:03:24.049> can<00:03:24.260> make<00:03:24.440> things<00:03:24.680> like<00:03:24.890> acid<00:03:25.340> grenades

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
you can make things like acid grenades

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.210 
you can make things like acid grenades
tnt<00:03:26.480> acid<00:03:26.840> and<00:03:27.019> this<00:03:27.170> is<00:03:27.380> how<00:03:27.560> you<00:03:27.590> make<00:03:27.980> the

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
tnt acid and this is how you make the

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.729 
tnt acid and this is how you make the
acid<00:03:28.579> grenade<00:03:28.940> by<00:03:29.720> putting<00:03:30.140> plasma<00:03:30.410> on<00:03:30.680> the

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
acid grenade by putting plasma on the

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.569 
acid grenade by putting plasma on the
bottom<00:03:30.980> as<00:03:31.190> a<00:03:31.630> grenade<00:03:32.630> our<00:03:32.840> acid<00:03:33.440> vial<00:03:34.280> in<00:03:34.489> the

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
bottom as a grenade our acid vial in the

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.259 
bottom as a grenade our acid vial in the
middle<00:03:34.820> and<00:03:35.230> then<00:03:36.230> ironing<00:03:36.620> it<00:03:36.739> on<00:03:36.860> top<00:03:37.190> and<00:03:37.910> to

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
middle and then ironing it on top and to

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.090 
middle and then ironing it on top and to
make<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:39.370> sea<00:03:40.370> where<00:03:40.579> is<00:03:40.700> it<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:41.930> acid<00:03:42.680> tnt

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
make the sea where is it the acid tnt

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.949 
make the sea where is it the acid tnt
you<00:03:43.610> just<00:03:43.880> make<00:03:44.209> it<00:03:44.239> like<00:03:44.600> you<00:03:44.780> would<00:03:44.900> a

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
you just make it like you would a

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.530 
you just make it like you would a
regular<00:03:45.049> piece<00:03:45.560> of<00:03:45.739> TNT<00:03:46.070> except<00:03:46.690> with<00:03:47.799> acid
