instead of asking for things like that I

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.380 
instead of asking for things like that I

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
little bit less scary for example faced

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.190 
little bit less scary for example faced
with<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.420> prospect<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.930> having<00:00:52.050> to

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
with the prospect of having to

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.690 
with the prospect of having to
eventually<00:00:52.650> move<00:00:52.800> out<00:00:52.950> of<00:00:52.980> my<00:00:53.190> parents<00:00:53.370> house

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
eventually move out of my parents house

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.310 
eventually move out of my parents house
I've<00:00:53.910> decided<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.450> be<00:00:54.570> much<00:00:54.720> more<00:00:54.750> easy<00:00:55.140> if

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
I've decided it to be much more easy if

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.110 
I've decided it to be much more easy if
my<00:00:55.440> parents<00:00:55.620> would<00:00:55.860> simply<00:00:56.190> move<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.700> lead<00:00:56.970> me

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
my parents would simply move and lead me

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.140 
my parents would simply move and lead me
the<00:00:57.270> house<00:00:57.390> instead<00:00:58.640> and<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.700> guess<00:00:59.850> take<00:01:00.030> my

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
the house instead and I guess take my

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.430 
the house instead and I guess take my
sister<00:01:00.390> with<00:01:00.510> them<00:01:00.750> too<00:01:00.870> because<00:01:01.110> she

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
sister with them too because she

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.780 
sister with them too because she
probably<00:01:01.650> needs<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.010> place<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.220> live<00:01:02.460> thank<00:01:02.700> you

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
probably needs a place to live thank you

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.370 
probably needs a place to live thank you
also<00:01:03.239> I'd<00:01:03.390> very<00:01:03.570> much<00:01:03.660> like<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.989> if<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.229> could
