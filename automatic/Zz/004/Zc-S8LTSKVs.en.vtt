00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.320 
getting on top of the firing range sky
barrier<00:00:56.660> now<00:00:57.440> doing<00:00:58.100> this<00:00:58.400> glitch<00:00:58.699> starts<00:00:59.180> out

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330 
barrier now doing this glitch starts out

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.330 
barrier now doing this glitch starts out
just<00:00:59.629> like<00:00:59.840> every<00:01:00.320> other<00:01:00.350> glitch<00:01:00.860> basically

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
just like every other glitch basically

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.880 
just like every other glitch basically
in<00:01:01.550> black<00:01:01.850> ops<00:01:02.090> which<00:01:02.900> is<00:01:03.170> starting<00:01:03.739> with

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
in black ops which is starting with

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.890 
in black ops which is starting with
boosting<00:01:04.430> as<00:01:04.729> you<00:01:05.000> guys<00:01:05.150> can<00:01:05.360> see<00:01:05.420> we're<00:01:05.869> doing

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
boosting as you guys can see we're doing

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.440 
boosting as you guys can see we're doing
here<00:01:06.590> but<00:01:07.430> now<00:01:07.610> we're<00:01:07.850> going<00:01:07.940> to<00:01:08.000> skip<00:01:08.330> ahead

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
here but now we're going to skip ahead

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.920 
here but now we're going to skip ahead
to<00:01:08.690> when<00:01:09.259> we<00:01:09.470> breach<00:01:09.920> outside<00:01:10.550> the<00:01:10.790> map<00:01:11.090> by<00:01:11.869> the

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
to when we breach outside the map by the

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.420 
to when we breach outside the map by the
way<00:01:12.080> we're<00:01:12.290> I'm<00:01:12.440> assuming<00:01:12.890> that<00:01:13.009> you<00:01:13.070> guys<00:01:13.220> do

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
way we're I'm assuming that you guys do

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.590 
way we're I'm assuming that you guys do
know<00:01:13.550> how<00:01:13.670> to<00:01:13.700> do<00:01:13.880> this<00:01:14.060> because<00:01:14.240> if<00:01:14.450> you're

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
know how to do this because if you're

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.510 
know how to do this because if you're
watching<00:01:14.720> this<00:01:14.930> video<00:01:15.140> chances<00:01:16.039> are<00:01:16.340> you've

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
watching this video chances are you've

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.040 
watching this video chances are you've
already<00:01:16.880> glitched<00:01:17.090> on<00:01:17.240> black<00:01:17.479> ops<00:01:17.690> because

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
already glitched on black ops because

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.900 
already glitched on black ops because
the<00:01:18.170> game<00:01:18.320> has<00:01:18.350> been<00:01:18.560> out<00:01:18.680> for<00:01:18.860> so<00:01:19.009> long<00:01:19.190> now<00:01:19.250> so

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
the game has been out for so long now so

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.609 
the game has been out for so long now so
we're<00:01:20.030> not<00:01:20.090> going<00:01:20.270> to<00:01:20.360> do<00:01:20.479> any<00:01:20.720> tutorials<00:01:21.380> on

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
we're not going to do any tutorials on

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.190 
we're not going to do any tutorials on
breaching<00:01:22.460> or<00:01:22.610> anything<00:01:23.060> else<00:01:23.240> because<00:01:23.840> we

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
breaching or anything else because we

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.170 
breaching or anything else because we
figure<00:01:24.500> you<00:01:24.710> guys<00:01:24.830> probably<00:01:25.369> already<00:01:25.700> know

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
figure you guys probably already know

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.450 
figure you guys probably already know
how<00:01:26.360> but<00:01:27.140> now<00:01:27.320> after<00:01:27.590> you've<00:01:28.009> reached<00:01:28.250> outside

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
how but now after you've reached outside

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.120 
how but now after you've reached outside

onto that other roof a little watch

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.460 
onto that other roof a little watch
tower<00:01:58.340> roof<00:01:58.670> over<00:01:59.149> there<00:01:59.360> now<00:02:00.080> we've<00:02:00.289> actually

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
tower roof over there now we've actually

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.350 
tower roof over there now we've actually
uploaded<00:02:01.130> videos<00:02:01.429> in<00:02:01.550> the<00:02:01.670> past<00:02:01.789> how<00:02:02.119> to<00:02:02.179> do

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
uploaded videos in the past how to do

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.080 
uploaded videos in the past how to do
this<00:02:02.539> on<00:02:02.780> our<00:02:03.590> previous<00:02:03.950> channel<00:02:04.399> but<00:02:04.849> we're

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
this on our previous channel but we're

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.690 
this on our previous channel but we're
just<00:02:05.119> showing<00:02:05.390> you<00:02:05.509> how<00:02:05.780> today<00:02:06.500> just<00:02:07.280> so<00:02:07.640> you

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
just showing you how today just so you

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.729 
just showing you how today just so you
know<00:02:07.910> how<00:02:08.239> to<00:02:08.300> because<00:02:08.869> this<00:02:09.020> is<00:02:09.200> an<00:02:09.440> essential

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
know how to because this is an essential

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.880 
know how to because this is an essential
part<00:02:10.069> of<00:02:10.340> getting<00:02:10.640> on<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.180> sky<00:02:11.450> barrier<00:02:11.890> now

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
part of getting on the sky barrier now

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.280 
part of getting on the sky barrier now
after<00:02:13.520> you<00:02:13.610> make<00:02:13.849> this<00:02:14.209> stack<00:02:14.569> big<00:02:14.840> enough<00:02:15.080> to

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
after you make this stack big enough to

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.839 
after you make this stack big enough to
get<00:02:15.470> up<00:02:15.590> onto<00:02:15.770> the<00:02:16.069> watch<00:02:16.220> tower<00:02:16.520> which<00:02:16.730> i

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
get up onto the watch tower which i

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.210 
get up onto the watch tower which i
think<00:02:16.910> is<00:02:17.150> like<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:17.390> eight<00:02:18.230> stack<00:02:18.680> or<00:02:18.920> seven

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
think is like a eight stack or seven

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.420 
think is like a eight stack or seven
stack<00:02:19.459> something<00:02:19.910> like<00:02:20.060> that<00:02:20.349> then<00:02:21.349> on<00:02:21.709> top<00:02:21.770> of

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
stack something like that then on top of

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.949 
stack something like that then on top of
this<00:02:22.520> watch<00:02:22.760> how<00:02:23.030> are<00:02:23.180> your<00:02:23.330> going<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.569> want<00:02:23.599> to

this watch how are your going to want to
want<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.950> person<00:02:25.160> who's<00:02:25.459> not<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:26.060> host<00:02:26.330> to

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
want the person who's not the host to

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.949 
want the person who's not the host to
get<00:02:27.590> god<00:02:27.950> mode<00:02:27.980> because<00:02:28.730> obviously<00:02:29.390> there's<00:02:29.900> a
