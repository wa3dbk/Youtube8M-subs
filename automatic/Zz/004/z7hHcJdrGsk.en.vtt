00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.380 

hey<00:00:04.810> guys<00:00:04.990> so<00:00:05.680> the<00:00:06.010> process<00:00:06.490> of<00:00:06.640> coloring<00:00:07.180> and

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:07.390 
hey guys so the process of coloring and

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.450 
hey guys so the process of coloring and
contouring<00:00:08.020> the<00:00:08.200> skin<00:00:08.500> on<00:00:08.740> a<00:00:08.800> face<00:00:09.100> chart

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:09.460 
contouring the skin on a face chart

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.120 
contouring the skin on a face chart
using<00:00:09.850> cream<00:00:10.120> products<00:00:10.570> is<00:00:10.780> very<00:00:11.110> similar<00:00:11.410> to

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:12.130 
using cream products is very similar to

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.100 
using cream products is very similar to
using<00:00:12.340> powders<00:00:12.970> it's<00:00:13.300> just<00:00:13.480> a<00:00:13.600> little<00:00:13.870> slower

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.110 
using powders it's just a little slower

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.380 
using powders it's just a little slower
and<00:00:14.410> a<00:00:14.740> little<00:00:14.980> more<00:00:15.160> tricky<00:00:15.400> I<00:00:15.760> think<00:00:16.150> it

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390 
and a little more tricky I think it

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.210 
and a little more tricky I think it
takes<00:00:16.539> a<00:00:16.660> little<00:00:16.869> bit<00:00:16.990> more<00:00:17.140> practice<00:00:17.650> because

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
takes a little bit more practice because

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.340 
takes a little bit more practice because
creams<00:00:18.550> adhere<00:00:19.000> to<00:00:19.210> the<00:00:19.300> paper<00:00:19.510> different<00:00:20.170> and

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:20.350 
creams adhere to the paper different and

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.050 
creams adhere to the paper different and
quite<00:00:20.830> frankly<00:00:21.039> I<00:00:21.280> think<00:00:21.520> a<00:00:21.760> little<00:00:21.910> bit

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
quite frankly I think a little bit

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.350 
quite frankly I think a little bit
better<00:00:22.270> than<00:00:22.570> powder<00:00:22.810> products<00:00:23.380> the<00:00:24.360> margin

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.360 
better than powder products the margin

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.689 
better than powder products the margin
of<00:00:25.480> error<00:00:25.690> is<00:00:26.380> very<00:00:26.800> narrow<00:00:27.190> when<00:00:27.490> working

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:27.699 
of error is very narrow when working

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.179 
of error is very narrow when working
with<00:00:28.000> creams<00:00:28.330> however<00:00:29.080> you<00:00:29.800> can<00:00:30.039> get

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
with creams however you can get

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.819 
with creams however you can get
strikingly<00:00:31.119> realistic<00:00:31.869> results<00:00:32.349> should<00:00:32.679> you

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 
strikingly realistic results should you

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.340 
strikingly realistic results should you
choose<00:00:33.129> to<00:00:33.489> do<00:00:33.760> so<00:00:34.059> if<00:00:34.510> you've<00:00:34.839> never<00:00:34.989> done<00:00:35.289> it

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
choose to do so if you've never done it

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.349 
choose to do so if you've never done it
before<00:00:35.499> it's<00:00:36.309> worth<00:00:36.550> a<00:00:36.699> try<00:00:36.909> just<00:00:37.239> to

00:00:37.349 --> 00:00:37.359 
before it's worth a try just to

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:39.479 
before it's worth a try just to
experiment<00:00:37.809> so<00:00:38.530> you're<00:00:38.800> gonna<00:00:38.920> start<00:00:39.249> by

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
experiment so you're gonna start by

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.869 
experiment so you're gonna start by
taping<00:00:39.760> your<00:00:40.120> page<00:00:40.449> down<00:00:40.960> to<00:00:41.409> a<00:00:41.440> surface<00:00:42.129> using

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
taping your page down to a surface using

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.599 
taping your page down to a surface using
either<00:00:43.030> painters<00:00:43.600> tape<00:00:43.870> or<00:00:44.170> drafting<00:00:45.159> tape<00:00:45.399> or

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:45.609 
either painters tape or drafting tape or

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:48.000 
either painters tape or drafting tape or
drafting<00:00:46.089> dots<00:00:46.329> if<00:00:46.600> you<00:00:46.690> have<00:00:46.899> them<00:00:47.170> you<00:00:47.409> want

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
drafting dots if you have them you want

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.169 
drafting dots if you have them you want
to<00:00:48.100> do<00:00:48.219> this<00:00:48.370> because<00:00:48.579> you<00:00:48.819> don't<00:00:48.999> want<00:00:49.120> the

00:00:49.169 --> 00:00:49.179 
to do this because you don't want the

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:51.180 
to do this because you don't want the
page<00:00:49.389> to<00:00:49.420> wrinkle<00:00:50.079> at<00:00:50.199> all<00:00:50.440> and<00:00:50.739> you're<00:00:51.039> going

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
page to wrinkle at all and you're going

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.759 
page to wrinkle at all and you're going
to<00:00:51.219> be<00:00:51.339> applying<00:00:51.969> more<00:00:52.269> pressure<00:00:52.409> to<00:00:53.409> the<00:00:53.440> page

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
to be applying more pressure to the page

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:56.189 
to be applying more pressure to the page
than<00:00:54.100> you<00:00:54.190> do<00:00:54.399> with<00:00:54.819> powders<00:00:55.359> now<00:00:55.959> we're<00:00:56.079> gonna

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
than you do with powders now we're gonna

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.770 
than you do with powders now we're gonna
start<00:00:56.499> here<00:00:56.709> by<00:00:56.889> taking<00:00:57.249> a<00:00:57.399> concealer<00:00:57.609> and<00:00:58.089> it

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
start here by taking a concealer and it

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.389 
start here by taking a concealer and it
honestly<00:00:59.199> doesn't<00:00:59.440> matter<00:00:59.709> which<00:00:59.889> concealer

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
honestly doesn't matter which concealer

honestly doesn't matter which concealer
or<00:01:00.579> foundation<00:01:01.389> you<00:01:01.539> use<00:01:01.869> you'll<00:01:02.679> probably

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:02.889 
or foundation you use you'll probably

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:05.369 
or foundation you use you'll probably
find<00:01:03.339> with<00:01:03.579> experimenting<00:01:04.390> which<00:01:04.809> products

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
find with experimenting which products

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.780 
find with experimenting which products
you<00:01:05.440> favor<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.310> most<00:01:06.760> for<00:01:07.060> this<00:01:07.180> but<00:01:08.110> I<00:01:08.140> think
