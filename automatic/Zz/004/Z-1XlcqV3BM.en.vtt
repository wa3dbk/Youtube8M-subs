00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello beauties i wanted my today 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.299
 first video from my new video series 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.610
 Upload product in the test 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.349
 I bought a new product that 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.900
 it from the deadline and currently a lot 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.360
 had from the drugstore there for five 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.300
 euro and call itself cleaning gel make 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.930
 up remover tolerance with 0 percent pa 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.060
 rabin 0% silicone 0 percent buffer for 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.039
 sensitive and over sensitive skin I 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.320
 I thought that could if it works 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.420
 super type for bio them so bio has 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.610
 to be two as a make-up remover me 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.290
 I would say I'll go with you 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.020
 go to the bathroom and try that 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.550
 whole from a short word before that what 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.230
 I even ask on the face what 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.079
 I should have a layer down again 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.500
 foundation on it santucci clear I have 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.420
 could it, I have good mood ginger 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.840
 lee from mac and i wear a layer 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.550
 quantity pressed powder of la mercy and 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.840
 Now we were welcome in 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.360
 my bathroom 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.699
 I have a bit of a hair 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.379
 made a linear clamped away there 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.350
 she will not totally ra in the water immediately 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.450
 are flowers and we are now through 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.580
 how to make the whole healing so 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.409
 tolerance contains water and flowers 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.420
 particularly skin-friendly ingredients 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.790
 application tips with cotton pad or 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.040
 then apply fingertips with 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.720
 I remove the waterbed or water 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.720
 would say 50 50 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.630
 it really is like that 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:31.619
 jay okay so it smells very much 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.200
 very very bad for these flowers water 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.259
 what is contained therein comes at least 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.939
 ever something down and it should also 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:46.500
 for the sensitive eye area 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:48.180
 So suitable are the mascara is 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.649
 not that much, I think so 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.000
 that burns a bit on the eye 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.130
 well ok so the other side 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 rather conventional and rub with 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.000
 absorb water 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:06.440
 you already know the consistency 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:09.200
 it's more slippery and me 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.729
 know that now down on the 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.590
 right side is a bit more 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.570
 Loves namely left where also something 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.120
 what's left is what amazes me right now 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.770
 So apparently it does not even get that 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.570
 I would not have eyeshadows around 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.730
 say that it leaves directly in the film 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:27.320
 but rinsing off with water does 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.180
 less film without rinsing off water yet 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.800
 Worth more than was seen how many more 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.930
 So that's what I'm expecting 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.700
 a little bit more is because of that 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.480
 I just do not know 90 percent 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.950
 the make up remover is just like that 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.660
 that this layer of make-up 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.100
 really does not get down though 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.630
 I want a lot now 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.860
 actually not left on 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.209
 the cotton pad so to be honest 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.380
 I think that's a bit 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:58.330
 a lot so that's that's almost it 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.739
 much like he took down himself 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.780
 in any case with the bio villages it 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.700
 now finally the eyeshadow 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.950
 by the way has no primer down 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.970
 before down below and it always comes 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.080
 more under 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.739
 so it would say that it is not very 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.400
 satisfactory result 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:20.720
 try the other side and also 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.090
 here is shadow now only down it 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.519
 looks better with the water than with 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.989
 the ipad to be honest too 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.730
 I find a bit much 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.799
 You can write me once like you 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.269
 So that is how with you is like 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.810
 much then actually below 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:37.430
 comes because for a make up remover the 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.110
 especially for make up remover so 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.700
 if that's a face cleaner now 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.079
 Men quite normal, I would say that 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.500
 not so bad and here comes 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:49.400
 massive hangar so get out of mine 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.840
 car on the waterbed and that's why 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.400
 is actually too much make-up what 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.380
 I still down with the bio- poor 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.420
 I personally got to think for 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.490
 me is the 1 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.250
 with clean enough because much better 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:04.870
 cope with the bio and poorer and afterwards 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.160
 with the softlaser the marriage contract i 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.260
 also great so I have with the 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.330
 No problems at all, it smells like that 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.190
 still so strong after these flowers 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.989
 water so i think it's good 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.670
 these whole things do not include the 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.500
 written down here and that 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.720
 It just designed for sensitive skin 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.489
 but I think it's still a make 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.560
 up Remover and so still the make up 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.360
 Company and I think that has here 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.530
 he somehow did not do that well 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.910
 Maybe just a little bit 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.979
 have too high claims 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.479
 if you have some point tested 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.410
 or you can go down to the 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.880
 Write comments 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.440
 if he could handle it better 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.970
 because everyone is a different skin color 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.229
 everyone uses a different make-up 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.810
 maybe mainz was supposed to be that 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:41.680
 stubborn or something and I hope it has 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.900
 brought you something 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.330
 if you have more live tests like this or 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.510
 so what you want then get in touch and 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.510
 bye for now
