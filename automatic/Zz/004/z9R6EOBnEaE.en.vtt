 nice to eight saw when you add some 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.080
 for example if you add a silent 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.840

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.510
 in a Belgian from half of his 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.070
 life the match she did not have me there I 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:33.010
 plus a very serious value 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:35.380
 to tanger skirmishers to finance 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.970
 the powerful hyper or but yeah but 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.780

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:41.919
 well no gains he's not a lot 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:45.940
 travel like a bullet in the body of 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:47.919
 month a year in the jury body had his 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.390
 value a little bit of life so 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:54.400

00:06:49.390 --> 00:07:01.030

 I'll eat you his duties 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:09.820
 it was he who was hidden behind him 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:12.970
 his art frankly since I do not have 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:21.880
 could resist the go ahead pulls me in 

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:23.680
 the body kind that's it so I pulled in 

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:27.610
 the heap saw all the balls I have 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.500
 shot I got nothing and I did not even 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.730
 desire 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:33.340
 it is not very powerful in the 

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:35.550
 the harsh or import more people pace 

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:41.180
 killer 

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:47.340
 frankly it is my expectation that 

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:48.900
 maybe she gives up the pace when 

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:51.090
 we roll their shots well 

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:53.760
