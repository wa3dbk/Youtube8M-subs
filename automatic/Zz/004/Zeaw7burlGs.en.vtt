sturdy<00:00:14.809> but<00:00:15.830> thin<00:00:17.660> object<00:00:18.800> I'm<00:00:19.800> using<00:00:20.039> this

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
sturdy but thin object I'm using this

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.700 
sturdy but thin object I'm using this
knife<00:00:20.580> its<00:00:20.970> bendable<00:00:21.510> what<00:00:22.140> I'm<00:00:22.199> doing<00:00:22.560> is

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
knife its bendable what I'm doing is

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.099 
knife its bendable what I'm doing is
there's<00:00:23.010> some<00:00:23.220> little<00:00:23.400> teeth<00:00:23.699> or<00:00:24.029> palms<00:00:24.720> in

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
there's some little teeth or palms in

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.220 
there's some little teeth or palms in
different<00:00:25.439> areas<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:26.390> are<00:00:27.390> rigid<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.050> are

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
different areas that are rigid and are

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.830 
different areas that are rigid and are
underneath<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.949> lip<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.519> tin<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.750> I'm

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
underneath the lip of the tin so I'm

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.630 
underneath the lip of the tin so I'm
just<00:00:31.019> popping<00:00:31.320> those<00:00:31.769> out<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.250> recommend

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
just popping those out and I recommend

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.150 
just popping those out and I recommend
after<00:00:33.090> doing<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.719> going<00:00:34.469> from<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.770> back<00:00:34.950> of

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
after doing this going from the back of

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.590 
after doing this going from the back of
the<00:00:35.219> front<00:00:35.399> because<00:00:35.670> there's<00:00:35.850> two<00:00:36.030> magnets<00:00:36.480> in

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
the front because there's two magnets in

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.680 
the front because there's two magnets in
the<00:00:36.690> front<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.579> make<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.700> harder<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.239> pop<00:00:39.450> out

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
the front that make it harder to pop out

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.040 
the front that make it harder to pop out
see<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.620> kind<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.239> hit<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.420> one<00:00:42.600> on<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.780> left

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
see I kind of hit the one on the left

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.319 
see I kind of hit the one on the left
there<00:00:43.370> so<00:00:44.370> that's<00:00:44.550> what<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.760> looks<00:00:44.910> like<00:00:45.090> when

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
there so that's what it looks like when

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.040 
there so that's what it looks like when
it's<00:00:45.450> out<00:00:46.820> and<00:00:47.820> Here<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.329> am<00:00:48.360> popping<00:00:48.840> them<00:00:48.930> out

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
it's out and Here I am popping them out

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.770 
it's out and Here I am popping them out
I<00:00:49.110> recommend<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.770> get<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.980> heat<00:00:50.190> source<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.850> do

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
I recommend you get a heat source and do

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.240 
I recommend you get a heat source and do
the<00:00:51.930> lighter<00:00:52.140> trick<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.739> just<00:00:52.770> push<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.070> from

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
the lighter trick and just push it from

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.250 
the lighter trick and just push it from
the<00:00:53.399> back<00:00:53.610> but<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:53.969> was<00:00:54.210> on<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.360> time<00:00:54.629> schedule<00:00:54.899> so

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
the back but I was on a time schedule so

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.920 
the back but I was on a time schedule so
I<00:00:55.289> did<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.860> way<00:00:56.360> this<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.420> more<00:00:57.719> difficult

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
I did it this way this is more difficult

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.430 
I did it this way this is more difficult
and<00:00:58.620> I'm<00:00:58.800> just<00:00:58.980> going<00:00:59.190> corner<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.730> corner<00:00:59.940> and

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
and I'm just going corner to corner and

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.670 
and I'm just going corner to corner and
then<00:01:01.440> trying

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
then trying

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.920 
then trying
open

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:16.830 

and<00:01:07.920> there<00:01:08.160> it<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.310> empty

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.960 

so<00:01:17.350> here<00:01:17.650> is<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:18.070> to<00:01:18.190> face<00:01:18.430> when<00:01:18.670> I'm<00:01:18.729> gonna<00:01:18.820> go

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
so here is the to face when I'm gonna go

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.399 
so here is the to face when I'm gonna go
palette<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.920> I<00:01:21.010> probably<00:01:21.250> could<00:01:21.520> have<00:01:21.729> put

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
palette and I probably could have put

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.960 
palette and I probably could have put
the<00:01:23.409> eyeshadows<00:01:23.920> down<00:01:24.159> there<00:01:24.430> that<00:01:24.640> I<00:01:24.700> wanted

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
the eyeshadows down there that I wanted

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.460 
the eyeshadows down there that I wanted
but<00:01:25.150> I<00:01:25.180> wanted<00:01:25.720> the<00:01:26.670> Luminizer<00:01:27.670> in<00:01:27.970> there

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
but I wanted the Luminizer in there

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.950 
but I wanted the Luminizer in there
to<00:01:28.830> go<00:01:28.980> in<00:01:29.160> the<00:01:29.310> Paladin<00:01:29.880> tennis<00:01:30.330> really

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
to go in the Paladin tennis really

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.620 
to go in the Paladin tennis really
so<00:01:31.830> there's<00:01:32.010> a<00:01:32.070> little<00:01:32.250> area<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.450> bottom

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
so there's a little area in the bottom

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.050 
so there's a little area in the bottom
it's<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.440> a<00:01:34.470> hole<00:01:34.770> all<00:01:35.580> you<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:35.760> to<00:01:35.820> do<00:01:35.940> is

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
it's like a hole all you have to do is

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.630 
it's like a hole all you have to do is
open<00:01:36.300> up<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:37.110> back<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.350> push<00:01:37.920> up<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.190> hole<00:01:38.400> and

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
open up the back and push up a hole and

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.840 
open up the back and push up a hole and
that<00:01:38.760> pops<00:01:39.030> right<00:01:39.240> out

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.940 

you<00:01:46.119> can<00:01:46.270> see<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.540> holes<00:01:46.750> back<00:01:47.020> there<00:01:47.350> I<00:01:47.619> think

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
you can see the holes back there I think

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.800 
you can see the holes back there I think
there's<00:01:48.189> something<00:01:48.520> that's<00:01:48.670> a<00:01:48.820> match<00:01:49.000> I'm<00:01:49.750> not

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
there's something that's a match I'm not

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.660 
there's something that's a match I'm not
gonna<00:01:50.080> bore<00:01:50.320> you<00:01:50.560> with<00:01:50.590> popping<00:01:51.189> those<00:01:51.340> out<00:01:51.549> as
