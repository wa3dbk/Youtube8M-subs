00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.340 
don't know i can't read their minds why
they<00:02:11.210> did<00:02:11.390> that<00:02:11.980> this<00:02:12.980> thing<00:02:13.040> goes<00:02:13.460> up<00:02:13.700> by

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
they did that this thing goes up by

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.630 
they did that this thing goes up by
three<00:02:15.350> point<00:02:15.680> three<00:02:16.750> point<00:02:17.750> two<00:02:18.470> mil<00:02:19.310> every

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
three point three point two mil every

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.690 
three point three point two mil every
day<00:02:19.790> I<00:02:19.820> think<00:02:20.210> I<00:02:20.480> just<00:02:21.110> click<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.530> back<00:02:21.740> okay<00:02:22.670> I

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
day I think I just click the back okay I

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.820 
day I think I just click the back okay I
think<00:02:23.090> it's<00:02:23.210> three<00:02:23.330> point<00:02:23.540> two<00:02:23.660> mil<00:02:23.840> every<00:02:24.680> day

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
think it's three point two mil every day

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.250 
think it's three point two mil every day
so<00:02:25.130> good<00:02:25.370> investment<00:02:25.880> there<00:02:26.030> not<00:02:26.840> every<00:02:27.110> day

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
so good investment there not every day

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.180 
so good investment there not every day
every<00:02:27.560> like<00:02:27.800> four<00:02:28.070> days<00:02:29.680> let's<00:02:30.680> do<00:02:30.770> a<00:02:30.800> Santa
