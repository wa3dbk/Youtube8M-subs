00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:14.389
 learn with a sea your darling out there 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:18.289
 marcelino called vázquez who died 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:22.830
 I shared peace that he just taught me 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:25.510
 who died of the matías that of a tomato 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.020
 waters and pigeon 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:31.810
 I already knew how to touch where I want to go 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.310
 he taught all the terms as we are of 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.610
 your horses 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:40.750
 Marcelino is a person with a wealth 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:43.629
 cultural but forgotten as the same 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.360
 culture in el salvador so that what 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:49.300
 that is portrayed in this documentary is the 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.660
 personal life of don marcelino that 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.850
 be an indigenous person have a 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.060
 philosophy of life with some values 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:03.190
 different to most people 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:05.290
 It also has a value on its contribution to 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.240
 the culture of the savior 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.970
 the native dances for example the 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.940
 tiger and the deer is part of the culture 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.950
 of el salvador and don marcelino was a 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.520
 person who for many many years 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.790
 he gave life to this type of dance he was 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.950
 who made the drums played them and 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.220
 they also made some whistles 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.920
 and he was the one who played these melodies 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.890
 musicals then the title of the tiger 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.160
 and the deer is for the dance but also 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.060
 makes a metaphor let's say because 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.800
 marcelino galicia is a survivor of 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.350
 1932 I have something pending as 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.660
 marcelino first the presentation of 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.520
 documentary there in your community I 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.640
 I always told him about Marcelino when 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.780
 present, I want you from there 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.550
 now he will not be physically but that 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.140
 is that promise I made to him that his 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.270
 documentary is going to see first in his 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.170
 community we will meet today on 8 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.330
 February 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.369
 another pending thing that I have of 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.780
 marcelino do is send such 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.789
 a plate for your 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.940
 because when he was buried 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.819
 circular poverty of the family 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.370
 they did not put a cross and the only thing 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.800
 they did was stop putting a branch 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.110
 to leave the hole let's say and then 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:28.250
 put the cross 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.080
 eight months after his death ten 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.180
 days I visited the tomb don marcelino and 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.850
 I already had a cross on a branch of a 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.250
 tree that had only been notified with a 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:42.100
 crow and there were the three initials of 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:44.960
 he is mg of marcelino galicia fabián 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.690
 then what we have done in a first 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:51.620
 time is we have sent to 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:55.670
 let's say a little plate and a cross 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:58.370
 cement and that is already finished and what 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:02.570
 another pending that you have to send 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:05.690
 to make an insert with the drum and 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.209
 the whistles that's why I do not want to 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.070
 do it myself let's just say maybe 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.530
 ask for a collection in the presentations 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.500
 of the movie so that the people who 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:19.360
 want to collaborate can contribute and send 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.360
