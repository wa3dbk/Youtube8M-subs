00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
they just really screwed up on the just

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.050 
they just really screwed up on the just
balancing<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.280> overall<00:02:45.519> character<00:02:45.880> they

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
balancing the overall character they

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.180 
balancing the overall character they
made<00:02:46.330> her<00:02:46.480> do<00:02:46.630> a<00:02:46.660> little<00:02:47.049> bit<00:02:47.290> or<00:02:47.530> balanced<00:02:48.040> out

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
made her do a little bit or balanced out

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.530 
made her do a little bit or balanced out
more<00:02:48.459> late<00:02:48.640> game<00:02:48.880> she<00:02:49.060> would<00:02:49.180> be<00:02:49.269> very

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
more late game she would be very

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.630 
more late game she would be very
effective<00:02:49.870> you'd<00:02:50.590> see<00:02:50.799> a<00:02:50.830> lot<00:02:51.220> of<00:02:51.250> people

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
effective you'd see a lot of people

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.120 
effective you'd see a lot of people
playing<00:02:51.760> her<00:02:52.090> but<00:02:52.840> they<00:02:52.989> really<00:02:53.380> like<00:02:53.680> this<00:02:53.980> is

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
playing her but they really like this is

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.500 
playing her but they really like this is
the<00:02:54.220> first<00:02:54.519> character<00:02:54.730> that<00:02:55.150> I<00:02:55.180> can<00:02:55.360> say

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
the first character that I can say

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.940 
the first character that I can say
they've<00:02:55.780> probably<00:02:56.049> under<00:02:56.410> balance<00:02:56.739> cuz<00:02:56.890> I

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
they've probably under balance cuz I

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.190 
they've probably under balance cuz I
played<00:02:57.160> a<00:02:57.190> lot<00:02:57.519> of<00:02:57.700> games<00:02:57.880> with<00:02:58.060> police<00:02:58.390> we<00:02:59.019> map

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
played a lot of games with police we map

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.960 
played a lot of games with police we map
played<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.500> lot<00:02:59.890> of<00:03:00.070> them<00:03:00.160> have<00:03:00.310> tried<00:03:00.549> a<00:03:00.580> lot<00:03:00.940> of

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
played a lot of them have tried a lot of

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.110 
played a lot of them have tried a lot of
different<00:03:01.209> builds

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
different builds

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.229 
different builds
I've<00:03:02.959> only<00:03:03.170> had<00:03:03.470> a<00:03:03.860> mild<00:03:04.519> amount<00:03:04.909> of<00:03:05.060> success

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
I've only had a mild amount of success

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.600 
I've only had a mild amount of success
at<00:03:05.840> best<00:03:06.319> because<00:03:06.739> with<00:03:07.159> other<00:03:07.310> characters

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
at best because with other characters

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.030 
at best because with other characters
whenever<00:03:08.150> you<00:03:08.390> start<00:03:08.629> feeding<00:03:08.959> you<00:03:09.409> just<00:03:09.709> you

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
whenever you start feeding you just you

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.369 
whenever you start feeding you just you
usually<00:03:10.459> just<00:03:10.909> continue<00:03:11.840> to<00:03:11.959> feed<00:03:12.140> and<00:03:12.319> you

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
usually just continue to feed and you

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.140 
usually just continue to feed and you
can<00:03:12.620> keep<00:03:13.010> up<00:03:13.220> with<00:03:13.340> that<00:03:13.430> momentum<00:03:13.819> but<00:03:13.970> it's

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
can keep up with that momentum but it's

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.369 
can keep up with that momentum but it's
really<00:03:14.420> hard<00:03:14.690> for<00:03:14.750> this<00:03:14.900> character<00:03:15.080> to

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
really hard for this character to

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.850 
really hard for this character to
actually<00:03:15.650> just<00:03:15.830> continue<00:03:16.700> on<00:03:16.849> and<00:03:17.090> just<00:03:17.209> go

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
actually just continue on and just go

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.100 
actually just continue on and just go
just<00:03:18.860> keep<00:03:19.159> on<00:03:19.340> going<00:03:19.370> just<00:03:20.090> to<00:03:20.450> fuel<00:03:20.989> the

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
just keep on going just to fuel the

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.630 
just keep on going just to fuel the
momentum<00:03:21.530> because<00:03:21.680> i'll<00:03:21.920> start<00:03:22.159> off<00:03:22.250> really

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
momentum because i'll start off really

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.449 
momentum because i'll start off really
good<00:03:23.060> like<00:03:23.560> really<00:03:24.560> good<00:03:24.739> and<00:03:24.950> try<00:03:25.190> and<00:03:25.250> get<00:03:25.400> a

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
good like really good and try and get a

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.009 
good like really good and try and get a
lot<00:03:25.610> of<00:03:25.670> kills<00:03:25.970> and<00:03:26.329> then<00:03:26.420> like<00:03:26.599> it<00:03:26.750> will<00:03:26.870> just

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
lot of kills and then like it will just

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
of different things that you can do that

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.140 
of different things that you can do that
you<00:04:12.859> don't<00:04:13.040> see<00:04:13.280> with<00:04:13.370> a<00:04:13.430> lot<00:04:13.579> of<00:04:13.700> characters

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
you don't see with a lot of characters

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.900 
you don't see with a lot of characters
um<00:04:14.450> for<00:04:15.349> example<00:04:15.769> she<00:04:15.950> has<00:04:16.039> an<00:04:16.160> escape<00:04:16.370> if<00:04:16.760> you

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
um for example she has an escape if you

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.279 
um for example she has an escape if you
go<00:04:17.060> into<00:04:17.180> our<00:04:17.359> spider<00:04:17.630> form<00:04:17.930> you<00:04:18.049> hit<00:04:18.169> the<00:04:18.260> e

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
go into our spider form you hit the e

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:20.800 
go into our spider form you hit the e
you<00:04:18.680> can<00:04:18.829> either<00:04:18.979> a<00:04:19.340> just<00:04:20.150> sit<00:04:20.299> in<00:04:20.419> the<00:04:20.510> air<00:04:20.599> for

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
you can either a just sit in the air for

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.540 
you can either a just sit in the air for
a<00:04:20.840> few<00:04:20.930> seconds<00:04:21.410> which<00:04:21.620> is<00:04:21.650> actually<00:04:22.010> a<00:04:22.250> really

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
a few seconds which is actually a really

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.430 
a few seconds which is actually a really
cool<00:04:22.669> scape<00:04:23.150> I<00:04:23.300> like<00:04:23.510> that<00:04:23.660> idea<00:04:23.840> I<00:04:24.260> thought

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
cool scape I like that idea I thought

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.089 
cool scape I like that idea I thought
that's<00:04:24.560> pretty<00:04:24.830> cool<00:04:26.200> B<00:04:27.200> you<00:04:27.500> can<00:04:27.650> actually<00:04:27.830> go

00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:28.099 
that's pretty cool B you can actually go

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:30.519 
that's pretty cool B you can actually go
to<00:04:28.160> another<00:04:28.520> target<00:04:28.880> with<00:04:29.000> it

00:04:30.519 --> 00:04:30.529 
to another target with it

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:32.949 
to another target with it
it<00:04:30.829> usually<00:04:31.339> works<00:04:32.119> out<00:04:32.299> pretty<00:04:32.419> well<00:04:32.569> because

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:32.959 
it usually works out pretty well because

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:34.599 
it usually works out pretty well because
you<00:04:33.169> can<00:04:33.319> go<00:04:33.499> onto<00:04:33.739> them<00:04:34.009> and<00:04:34.039> then<00:04:34.309> you<00:04:34.429> can

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:34.609 
you can go onto them and then you can

00:04:34.609 --> 00:04:36.939 
you can go onto them and then you can
leap<00:04:34.789> on<00:04:34.999> switch<00:04:35.329> out<00:04:35.539> go<00:04:35.899> into<00:04:36.079> your<00:04:36.229> regular

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:36.949 
leap on switch out go into your regular

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.009 
leap on switch out go into your regular
form<00:04:37.459> and<00:04:37.729> drop<00:04:38.089> a<00:04:38.119> lot<00:04:38.299> of<00:04:38.389> spells<00:04:38.599> on<00:04:38.809> them

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:39.019 
form and drop a lot of spells on them

00:04:39.019 --> 00:04:42.299 
form and drop a lot of spells on them
and<00:04:39.939> that<00:04:40.939> one<00:04:41.089> works<00:04:41.299> out<00:04:41.479> pretty<00:04:41.569> well<00:04:41.719> and

00:04:42.299 --> 00:04:42.309 
and that one works out pretty well and

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:45.099 
and that one works out pretty well and
finally<00:04:43.309> she<00:04:43.489> has<00:04:43.579> a<00:04:43.609> stun<00:04:43.999> in<00:04:44.299> her<00:04:44.479> human<00:04:44.869> form

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:45.109 
finally she has a stun in her human form

00:04:45.109 --> 00:04:48.159 
finally she has a stun in her human form
and<00:04:45.439> she<00:04:46.399> has<00:04:46.609> like<00:04:46.969> this<00:04:47.359> spiderling<00:04:47.929> that

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
and she has like this spiderling that

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.289 
and she has like this spiderling that
comes<00:04:48.439> out<00:04:48.619> of<00:04:48.649> just<00:04:48.919> it's<00:04:49.819> just<00:04:49.969> like<00:04:50.209> a

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:50.299 
comes out of just it's just like a

00:04:50.299 --> 00:04:52.089 
comes out of just it's just like a
tracking<00:04:50.779> it's<00:04:50.929> like<00:04:51.019> a<00:04:51.049> homing<00:04:51.349> spiderling

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099 
tracking it's like a homing spiderling

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:54.729 
tracking it's like a homing spiderling
and<00:04:52.429> it's<00:04:52.579> just<00:04:52.729> like<00:04:52.789> must<00:04:53.629> kill<00:04:53.929> enemies<00:04:54.409> so

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:54.739 
and it's just like must kill enemies so

00:04:54.739 --> 00:04:57.129 
and it's just like must kill enemies so
that's<00:04:55.309> basically<00:04:55.489> what<00:04:55.879> it<00:04:55.909> does<00:04:55.999> and<00:04:56.359> it<00:04:56.689> was

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
that's basically what it does and it was

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.829 
that's basically what it does and it was
pretty<00:04:57.259> good<00:04:57.469> at<00:04:57.619> his<00:04:57.739> job<00:04:57.769> but<00:04:58.729> overall<00:04:58.969> um<00:04:59.389> I
