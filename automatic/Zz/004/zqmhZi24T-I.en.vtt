 itinerary shows the new program 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.210

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.320
 plan of alternative routes of the 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.010

 tamara de anda 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.850
 the program is quite agile and 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.970
 very accessible they do not have is not 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.699
 pretentious the joke is that people what 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.460
 see you fall in love with the places and then 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.739
 tell me I want to go there is not that 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.690
 it's how I want to meet this person 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.309
 with which I was talking so bad 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.780
 with the one who is talking Maria and then 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.670
 all this that I do all the time of 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.980
 recommend sites on twitter and 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.840
 to visit 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.989
 this goes beyond the 140 characters 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.120
 to take it to a whole story for 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.250
 recommend these sites that of those that 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.010
 I have heard them speak or that 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.110
 maybe I had no idea that they existed 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.610
 the joke is that you want to go and leave 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.869
 of this comfort zone in which many 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.850
 we are always going to the same 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.380
 restaurant and how lazy to try something 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.690
 new and how lazy to leave our 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.550
 colony a program with the seal of eleven 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.340
 tv mexico that aims 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.110
 reveal to us the way in which the classic and 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.840
 the novelty coexist in the city ​​of 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.020
 Mexico and other states of the country already have 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.930
 a very very own style of the program 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.030
 although he talks about eclectic things like 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.250
 as the culture that can be 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.149
 artistic gastronomic expressions of 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:41.539
 popular culture is not no such a thing 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:46.280
 miscellany and schizophrenic nuts 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:48.659
 is a program that is very focused 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.270

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.820
