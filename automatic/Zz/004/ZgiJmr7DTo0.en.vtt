00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
gonna be once you get going here on the

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.670 
gonna be once you get going here on the
pace<00:00:35.760> lap<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:37.850> main<00:00:38.850> goal<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.410> get<00:00:40.530> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
pace lap the main goal is to get the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.619 
pace lap the main goal is to get the
tires<00:00:40.950> warmed<00:00:41.550> up<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.120> do<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.420> by

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
tires warmed up and you do that by

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.220 
tires warmed up and you do that by
weaving<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.530> car<00:00:43.739> around<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.160> track<00:00:44.430> which

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
weaving a car around the track which

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.630 
weaving a car around the track which
scrubs<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> tires<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.829> then<00:00:46.950> builds<00:00:47.250> up<00:00:47.370> heat

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
scrubs the tires and then builds up heat

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.260 
scrubs the tires and then builds up heat
and<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.570> need<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.079> because<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.820> tires<00:00:51.059> are

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
and you need that because the tires are

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.840 
and you need that because the tires are
cold<00:00:51.960> too<00:00:52.230> they've<00:00:52.469> been<00:00:52.590> sitting<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.250> when

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
cold too they've been sitting and when

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.220 
cold too they've been sitting and when
you<00:00:53.940> go<00:00:54.059> into<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.300> first<00:00:54.510> turn<00:00:54.780> after<00:00:54.989> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
you go into the first turn after the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.209 
you go into the first turn after the
green<00:00:55.440> flag<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:57.469> cold<00:00:58.469> tires<00:00:58.770> could<00:00:59.010> cause<00:00:59.190> a

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
green flag the cold tires could cause a

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.180 
green flag the cold tires could cause a
lot<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.760> trouble<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:01.199> main<00:01:01.440> goal<00:01:01.739> here<00:01:02.039> is

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
lot of trouble so the main goal here is

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.009 
lot of trouble so the main goal here is
just<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.460> weave<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.940> car<00:01:03.180> around<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.840> get

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
just to weave the car around and get

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.930 
just to weave the car around and get
some<00:01:04.049> heat<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.619> tires

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.370 

and<00:01:09.210> it's<00:01:09.870> hard<00:01:10.670> being<00:01:11.670> upfront<00:01:12.120> because<00:01:12.600> you

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
and it's hard being upfront because you

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.430 
and it's hard being upfront because you
know<00:01:13.530> there's<00:01:13.880> 20<00:01:14.880> or<00:01:15.000> 25<00:01:15.480> other<00:01:15.720> guys<00:01:15.960> behind

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
know there's 20 or 25 other guys behind

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.490 
know there's 20 or 25 other guys behind
you<00:01:16.740> who<00:01:17.580> are<00:01:17.820> want<00:01:18.570> nothing<00:01:18.930> more<00:01:18.960> than<00:01:19.170> to

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
you who are want nothing more than to

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.810 
you who are want nothing more than to
beat<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.930> the<00:01:21.930> minis<00:01:22.520> doubly<00:01:23.520> hard<00:01:23.670> in

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
beat you and the minis doubly hard in

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.420 
beat you and the minis doubly hard in
the<00:01:23.910> mini<00:01:24.090> because<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.890> it's<00:01:25.890> relatively

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
the mini because the it's relatively

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.280 
the mini because the it's relatively
underpowered<00:01:26.790> compared<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.810> other<00:01:27.960> cars

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
underpowered compared to the other cars

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.040 
underpowered compared to the other cars
and<00:01:28.650> they<00:01:29.250> have<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.400> good<00:01:29.700> chance<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.360> beating

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
and they have a good chance of beating

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:42.870 
and they have a good chance of beating
us<00:01:31.350> into<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> first<00:01:31.860> turn

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.580 

your<00:01:43.880> idea<00:01:44.210> your<00:01:44.450> hope<00:01:44.659> is<00:01:44.900> that<00:01:45.050> when<00:01:45.500> the

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
your idea your hope is that when the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.820 
your idea your hope is that when the
green<00:01:45.800> flag<00:01:45.830> falls<00:01:46.600> that<00:01:47.600> you're<00:01:48.229> able<00:01:48.409> to<00:01:48.590> out

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
green flag falls that you're able to out

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.340 
green flag falls that you're able to out
react<00:01:49.670> your<00:01:50.000> opponents<00:01:50.630> and<00:01:50.780> get<00:01:51.050> a<00:01:51.080> little

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
react your opponents and get a little

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.160 
react your opponents and get a little
bit<00:01:51.470> of<00:01:51.560> a<00:01:51.620> jump<00:01:51.920> on<00:01:52.130> them<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:52.990> hopefully<00:01:53.990> that

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
bit of a jump on them and hopefully that

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.410 
bit of a jump on them and hopefully that
will<00:01:54.290> overcome<00:01:54.740> their<00:01:55.010> excess<00:01:55.460> power<00:01:55.760> and<00:01:56.210> you

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
will overcome their excess power and you

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:18.150 
will overcome their excess power and you
can<00:01:56.570> beat<00:01:56.720> them<00:01:56.840> into<00:01:57.050> the<00:01:57.140> first<00:01:57.380> turn

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
hand and and basically I I do that by

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.760 
hand and and basically I I do that by
dress<00:03:37.300> even<00:03:37.900> though<00:03:38.110> I<00:03:38.140> have<00:03:38.290> a<00:03:38.350> big<00:03:38.500> lead<00:03:38.710> I

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
dress even though I have a big lead I

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.020 
dress even though I have a big lead I
Drive<00:03:39.130> as<00:03:39.310> hard<00:03:39.520> as<00:03:39.640> I<00:03:39.760> can

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
Drive as hard as I can

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.330 
Drive as hard as I can
I<00:03:40.360> just<00:03:41.200> take<00:03:41.380> it<00:03:41.410> a<00:03:41.530> little<00:03:41.620> easy<00:03:41.890> on<00:03:42.040> the

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
I just take it a little easy on the

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.000 
I just take it a little easy on the
engine<00:03:42.670> by<00:03:42.790> shifting<00:03:43.270> at<00:03:43.420> slower<00:03:43.750> rpm<00:03:44.020> maybe

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
engine by shifting at slower rpm maybe

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.770 
engine by shifting at slower rpm maybe
breaking<00:03:45.400> a<00:03:45.670> little<00:03:45.850> bit<00:03:45.970> earlier<00:03:46.480> but

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
breaking a little bit earlier but

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.870 
breaking a little bit earlier but
basically<00:03:47.290> still<00:03:47.680> pushing<00:03:48.310> hard<00:03:48.550> to<00:03:48.760> the

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
basically still pushing hard to the

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.520 
basically still pushing hard to the
corners<00:03:49.360> just<00:03:49.959> to<00:03:50.050> keep<00:03:50.170> the<00:03:50.350> concentration

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
corners just to keep the concentration

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.030 
corners just to keep the concentration
level<00:03:51.459> up

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.220 

and<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:55.400> mini-mini<00:03:56.000> such<00:03:56.269> a<00:03:56.300> nice<00:03:56.599> handling

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
and the mini-mini such a nice handling

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.360 
and the mini-mini such a nice handling
car<00:03:57.470> that<00:03:57.769> it<00:03:57.890> uh<00:03:58.959> it's<00:03:59.959> just<00:04:00.680> a<00:04:00.769> joy<00:04:01.010> to<00:04:01.040> drive

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
car that it uh it's just a joy to drive

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.479 
car that it uh it's just a joy to drive
so<00:04:02.000> it's<00:04:02.409> if<00:04:03.409> you<00:04:03.560> don't<00:04:03.739> mind<00:04:03.950> pushing<00:04:04.370> it

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
so it's if you don't mind pushing it

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.670 
so it's if you don't mind pushing it
hard<00:04:04.700> some<00:04:05.120> cars<00:04:05.360> are<00:04:05.569> scary<00:04:05.900> to<00:04:06.110> drive<00:04:06.319> fast

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
hard some cars are scary to drive fast
