00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:19.910
 Hey you guys, youtube of this video on 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:24.410
 area today I heard from you about the 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.760
 coolant or additive is not 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:32.329
 special protection for the 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:37.680
 Radiator sure to speak more precisely 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:40.920
 at the time of completion that happens in 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.750
 time to complete the ibi right a lot 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.149
 People, do not worry, they end up putting 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:52.350
 water in the reservoir is that it ends 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.050
 taking the correct additive percentage 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.239
 that it has to be in the case here of the 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:02.329
 vehicles of these seats 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.329
 flight own destination here and speaks 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:14.110
 has to be 60% one of water in 40 of 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:19.970
 additive 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:22.400
 this is the right recommendation 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.800
 so when you put it on the system 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.180
 You end up decreasing this percentage. 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.840
 of additive 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.910
 so I here when that likud got 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.590
 down until it 's low as the car 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:38.180
 that he was down he seems to be in a 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:41.780
 regional level is already here on a fallen 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:45.680
 he seems to be in our mandate not me 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.770
 when the liquid below 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:54.229
 I did not put water in my system 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:56.930
 simply bought an additive from you in the 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.570
 concessionaire and in this case this 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:07.009
 here is the old still g12 it comes 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:10.640
 specified here goals today already 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:14.870
 we have og 13 which is a little bit is a 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:18.560
 little better than the generous younger 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:23.180
 I did what I bought that water is for 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.610
 battery who says mineral water girl 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:30.470
 this stop is showing down 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:34.160
 wringing your tongue here to speak and visa 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.680
 the mixture from the additive to the radiator 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.519
 with the battery liquid and gave it 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.410
 here o 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.390
 I did in the correct proportion have to 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.700
 do the stuff to hit it right 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:49.820
 they both see one liter 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:53.209
 600 ml of the battery water and 400 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.580
 ml of the additive to the radiator and I did 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:59.570
 here practically 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:02.810
 one liter of coolant and 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:05.720
 When I need myself complete with 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.330
 the solution that I mixed goes full 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:12.830
 to maintain the character of my 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:16.400
 personal goal putting water water 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.800
 in a moment a little more than perhaps 23 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.220
 years will have to change one of additive 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.140
 I think it revolves around between three 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.220
 to five years in the system 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:31.670
 I think I'm not sure but he turns 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:35.680
 around 3 to 5 in the system for you 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:39.440
 do not need to change but that's it guys 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.290
 in emergency beauty an emergency not 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:46.450
 water is put in my way 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:49.459
 It's not as if you can 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.220
 another additive in the case the additive also 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:55.370
 not cheap said that at the dealership 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.550
 here close to eighty reais but I 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:02.000
 I can find the 40 to buy a little 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.850
 cheaper with 11 other distributor 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.330
 could not go to a dealership and you 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:12.830
 even complete level beyond you with the 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:16.609
 coolant to not come out of the 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:19.459
 amount of reservoir life 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:22.370
 This is it people, this is what I wanted 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:26.330
 to pass on to you liked the information 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.410
 in order liked it is very well useful to 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:33.680
 you 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:37.220
 I'll focus on focusing any questions and 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.200
 also about something I left behind 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.180
 to quote if you want to add more 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.880
 something that you can leave in the 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.950
 discussion on the subject and 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.750
 subscribe to the channel you will receive 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:52.610
 updates of new videos as well 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:55.419
 Thanks, guys, that's an additive hug. 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.419
 with radiator
