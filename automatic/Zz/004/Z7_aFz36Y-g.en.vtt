00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.170 
talking to her I think that either a
keeping<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.160> lines<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.459> communication<00:02:45.030> open

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
keeping the lines of communication open

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.260 
keeping the lines of communication open
is<00:02:45.650> always<00:02:46.650> good<00:02:46.950> that's<00:02:47.430> what<00:02:47.670> you<00:02:47.940> know<00:02:48.030> they

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
is always good that's what you know they

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.730 
is always good that's what you know they
always<00:02:48.450> people<00:02:48.900> always<00:02:49.170> encourage<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.590> to

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
always people always encourage you to

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.890 
always people always encourage you to
keep<00:02:49.950> communication<00:02:50.640> open<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:51.060> i<00:02:51.510> would<00:02:51.720> say

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
keep communication open and i would say

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.840 
keep communication open and i would say
that<00:02:52.200> because<00:02:52.470> it's<00:02:52.860> common<00:02:53.280> knowledge<00:02:53.310> and

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
that because it's common knowledge and

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.610 
that because it's common knowledge and
probably<00:02:54.270> common<00:02:54.660> wisdom<00:02:54.810> that's<00:02:55.170> probably

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
probably common wisdom that's probably

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.610 
probably common wisdom that's probably
the<00:02:56.160> right<00:02:56.310> way<00:02:56.550> now<00:02:57.150> my<00:02:57.690> thought<00:02:58.110> about<00:02:58.350> that

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
the right way now my thought about that

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.440 
the right way now my thought about that
which<00:02:58.950> may<00:02:59.160> be<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.430> complete<00:02:59.700> wrong<00:03:00.150> way<00:03:00.390> so

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
which may be the complete wrong way so

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.180 
which may be the complete wrong way so
if<00:03:00.720> you'll<00:03:00.870> free<00:03:01.230> everyone<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:01.830> yell<00:03:01.950> at<00:03:02.070> me<00:03:02.130> in

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
if you'll free everyone to yell at me in

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.199 
if you'll free everyone to yell at me in
the<00:03:02.250> comments<00:03:02.550> if<00:03:02.580> you<00:03:02.670> totally<00:03:02.910> disagree

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
the comments if you totally disagree

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.260 
the comments if you totally disagree
with<00:03:03.330> me<00:03:03.450> but<00:03:03.630> i<00:03:04.140> also<00:03:04.440> think<00:03:04.830> that<00:03:05.400> sometimes

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
with me but i also think that sometimes

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.020 
with me but i also think that sometimes
there<00:03:07.140> are<00:03:07.350> things<00:03:07.380> that<00:03:07.980> can't<00:03:08.670> really<00:03:08.910> be

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
there are things that can't really be

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.440 
there are things that can't really be
fixed<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.020> don't<00:03:10.709> necessarily<00:03:11.430> need<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.060> be

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
fixed and don't necessarily need to be

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.740 
fixed and don't necessarily need to be
fixed<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.140> sometimes<00:03:13.739> people<00:03:14.280> are<00:03:14.550> just<00:03:14.750> the

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
fixed and sometimes people are just the

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:16.970 
fixed and sometimes people are just the
way<00:03:15.870> they<00:03:16.080> are<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:16.260> they're<00:03:16.590> doing<00:03:16.860> their

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
way they are and they're doing their

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.940 
way they are and they're doing their
thing<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:17.430> it's<00:03:17.640> not<00:03:17.700> really<00:03:18.360> at<00:03:18.600> you<00:03:19.140> but<00:03:19.830> you

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
thing and it's not really at you but you

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.130 
thing and it's not really at you but you
feel<00:03:20.370> like<00:03:20.400> it's<00:03:20.820> at<00:03:20.970> you<00:03:21.209> I<00:03:21.390> know<00:03:21.510> for<00:03:21.959> me

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.680 
feel like it's at you I know for me
sometimes<00:03:22.830> I<00:03:23.040> take<00:03:23.310> on<00:03:23.549> other<00:03:24.060> people's

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
sometimes I take on other people's

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.170 
sometimes I take on other people's
things<00:03:24.930> as<00:03:25.260> if<00:03:25.560> it's<00:03:25.709> about<00:03:26.100> me<00:03:26.430> when<00:03:26.910> it's<00:03:27.030> not

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
things as if it's about me when it's not

doesn't need to be something talked out

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.259 
doesn't need to be something talked out
sometimes<00:04:17.250> it's<00:04:17.400> just<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.640> way<00:04:17.760> someone<00:04:18.030> is

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
sometimes it's just the way someone is

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.199 
sometimes it's just the way someone is
and<00:04:18.540> like<00:04:18.660> that's<00:04:19.290> okay<00:04:19.680> you<00:04:20.130> don't<00:04:20.160> I<00:04:20.340> mean<00:04:20.549> so
