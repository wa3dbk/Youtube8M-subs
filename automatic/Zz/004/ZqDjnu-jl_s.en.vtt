00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.930
 plans to parade with some 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:10.440
 portatropas vehicles which in this 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.049
 At the moment they carry anti-air missiles whose 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.429
 function is this save the sovereignty of 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:22.190
 our country 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:24.770
 which here antiaircraft 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.170
 this one here can take you can 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.560
 call as I come from a man here 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.230
 this is an address that takes you in a 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.899
 this 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.079
 even if it's multiple it has three missiles 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.590
 al in one position and later in 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:44.650
 this side has the anti-aircraft guns 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.710
 whose function is to address the airspace 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.839
 As we reach what may have 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.140
 enough to be able to improve 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:54.670
 and offensive that we have well this is the 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.000
 it has a special name this unit 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:01.480
 where is 123 cl 3 well and is this 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 which is around here is far reaching 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:09.310
 which are allowed as I say 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.560
 factor destroy or neutralize vectors 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.509
 offensive airs how many of these 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.660
 vehicles has the air force we have 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:19.899
 enough enough like this 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.090
 this here the function of this is 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.780
 against two vectors offensive beings like 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.789
 knows as our president said 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.729
 these are not we are dissuasive we are 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:32.830
 a peaceful dissuasive air force 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.869
 we all seek peace but also 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.459
 we have the we keep 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.450
 integrity of our country the Lord is 

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:43.539
 quiÃ±ones and the one that follows that is this is 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.520
 a radar system which this laptop 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:49.869
 that allows us to monitor the space of 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.340
 quinons and this is they carry them like 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.819
 the transfers for this one we can 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.590
 use it by land we bring you by air 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:59.659
 normally it goes to relative positions 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:04.329
 favorable that allow us this one 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:09.019
 monitor space iwaki the country 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:11.959
 superior as flash that allows us then 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:14.510
 this airspace work like them 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.840
 He said no when the country does not require 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.560
 we are ready to monitor the 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.720
 spaces like 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.870
 as it is like as mandated by 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.870
 Constitution
