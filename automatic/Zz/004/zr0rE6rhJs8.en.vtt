00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 Hello and welcome to the 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.350
 test the jabra level is 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:20.100

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:20.880

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.279

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.109
 and that looks like this we have 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.820
 of course, the headphones themselves with it 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.070
 but let's take a look 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.869
 little closer than next with im 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.059
 scope of delivery a storage 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.320
 or carry bag left here 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.140
 the headphones are perfect in it 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.989
 store or anywhere consequently as 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.940
 Next with the 3 5 mm deep 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.280
 Cable practical feature 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.300
 we have a built-in 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.399
 remote control hereby can be used for 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.149
 for example, music title or volume 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.070
 to change 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.230
 Last but not least with one 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.850
 getting started package in here 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.329
 Find information around the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.609
 headphones first hints and 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.379
 manual and now to the 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.480
 headphones themselves they let themselves 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.519
 of course, in the size and adjust 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.159
 are even foldable they adapt 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.680
 total of each head size perfect 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.330
 both earpieces and the temple 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.430
 on the top are very good 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.830
 padded and catch even after several 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.900
 hours of music pleasure not to squeeze 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.270
 this is also because the headphones 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.220
 weigh just 230 grams 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.650
 Finally, like mine 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.990
 personal conclusion overall I am with 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.299
 the jabra vivo really very satisfied 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.130
 they do not just look great, they 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.780
 offer a nice sound quality with 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.759
 good highs and lows 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.350
 especially deep basses can 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.250
 perfectly reproduce headphones 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.020
 and if more 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.549
 want to adjust the 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.869
 should be the best times jabra 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.640
 Download sound app 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.320

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.140
 develops and offers much more 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.549
 Settings and a special 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.770

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.770
