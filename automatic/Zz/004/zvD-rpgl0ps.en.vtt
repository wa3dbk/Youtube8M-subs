00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.560
 good welcome to another video from 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.020
 accessibility and such technology for 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.150
 all from your news section and 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.709
 technology analysis we will be 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.839
 answering a question they ask us 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.610
 much on social networks more than anything in 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:18.119
 the youtube channel recently we went up a 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.980
 video that said which computer is better 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.710
 which brand or buy laptop 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.199
 of desktop that reference and we were 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.759
 advising on this then many 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.220
 forms will ask the same thing but about 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.759
 tablets then what tablet should I 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.090
 to buy 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:35.789
 which is better ipad or those of samsung or 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.800
 those of asus or those of lenovo then 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:39.719
 the eternal dilemma returns as in the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.539
 cell phones that are then the famous 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.489
 to fan the iphone fans and the 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.260
 cell phones that is the best the iphone and 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.329
 are those of samsung or other brands 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.820
 for they defend with the soul the 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.219
 Android teams and there is the rebel that is 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.949
 it came out for windows phone and then there's 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.050
 as some groups let's say fanatics 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.960
 defenders of each brand 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.420
 and that does not exist, basically, it's like 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.670
 decide is to say me the best brand is 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.240
 like tastes that simple 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.159
 everyone has his thing can not 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.750
 to be one in an eternal dilemma fighting 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.909
 things and in tablets exactly happens 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.830
 they all have theirs and it's from 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.259
 according to your needs and budget 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.909
 if you just have 50 dollars 100 thousand 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.500
 weights because you have to buy a 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.119
 7 inch Chinese is that there is not one 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.830
 option to buy yourself an ipad 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.350
 simple or the budget too 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.670
 has to see a lot there are tablets already 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.380
 very economical what you just followed 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.430
 from 50 dollars we can already get 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.080
 a tablet 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.510
 the line in front already starts to go up 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.520
 samsung budget recently pulled a 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.960
 that I had the opportunity to try the one 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.920
 the samsung outro of 12.9 inches 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.020
 interesting is the biggest one until the 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.940
 moment of point me inches value 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.490
 million and a half pesos 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.340
 cost absurdities matter how good 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.030
 because a million and a half then it's too much 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.119
 money knowing that the 10-inch 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.130
 get like in a million or less 900 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.580
 a thousand but the basic version wifi and 16 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.740
 gigas then pay a million and a half not 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.930
 justify 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.080
 which is the best animal that has 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:18.760
 liked in my personal opinion I have a 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.890
 ipad2 after I already went to the ipad of which 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.050
 still fourth generation that is almost the 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.820
 same ipad2 but it comes with the advantage of 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.440
 that a better screen a better camera 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.100
 but equal the same battery life 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.050
 the same screen size which has 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.940
 I really liked the opportunity 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.800
 Try tablets of other brands do not 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.480
 liked the touch system so much what more 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.890
 I liked it so far it's ipad but 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.020
 I'm not seeing them buy ipad 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.850
 exactly you try the and 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.300
 agree its characteristics this size 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.550
 I like it's 39.7 inches is a size 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.040
 very practical very comfortable duration 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.990
 of the battery is extreme because it says that 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.970
 It takes 10 hours but one does not use 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.620
 10 hours simply pasted if by the 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.930
 tomorrow you fought half an hour before going 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.420
 to work at night I use a u 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.940
 Another half hour later the next day 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.430
 I use it after two hours another day if 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.210
 will last the week more than the week 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.030
 a single charge really is very 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.860
 very useful is a device these were going 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.320
 go to a conference an event in the 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.300
 which will be chatting all the time 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.190
 posting things on facebook 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.570
 posting on twitter this is going to 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.460
 hold the entire length of the 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.350
 conference maintaining a connection 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.160
 so data 3g if you have the 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.530
 team 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.150
 ie wifi or something like that already 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.680
 they have almost all those that are branded 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.660
 that is a samsung or nothing because it's going to 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.610
 give that battery autonomy a china no 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.430
 that I do tell them unless the 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.340
 budget is not good avoid these 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.280
 Chinese bargains when they say cell 7 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.310
 in 1 that has hm connection and that has 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.140
 3g that has wifi that has 204 that 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.320
 It serves as a phone that is 7 inches 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.750
 and ale 150 thousand pesos then 80 dollars and no 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.570
 it's like wal has all that and they're going to 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.490
 use and the battery does not last two hours 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.770
 then it is the mind of that year is not going to 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.390
 get a spare the charger that does not 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.660
 you get the ports for any 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.600
 thing then it 's a team for bass 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.970
 budget to buy it but that they 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.530
 I would recommend I look at your budget and 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.180
 look what they want they want it smaller 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.230
 the one who 7 inches or they want her from 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.720
 be of 9 points 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.210
 2 inches already there yes what they 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.480
 I recommend is to go to the store and compare 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:28.410
 bone pick and choose a samsung and catch 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:31.230
 an apple and then take also the 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.590
 other brands of a lenovo a to your the 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.330
 four others and look which one they like more 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.370
 then as I say, I leave you my 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.580
 recommendation for the apple is very good 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.100
 the cost about one in this 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.080
 moment it accepts in this menu 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.080
 that we are September 2014 that 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.930
 recorded this video 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:55.669
 what you get is the ipad was the 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:58.509
 ipad r is worth 899 thousand pesos I think 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:01.909
 that that's not 1900 thousand pesos is about 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:03.650
 450 dollars I stopped a very price 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:05.689
 very good economic is basically a 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.650
 little thinner than the rest is very 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:10.110
 similar 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.030
 they also sell the ipad mini for which 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.280
 I want it a little smaller 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.979
 lenovo has some very economic very 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.530
 good made one of 9 300 thousand pesos that 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:22.080
 they are spectacular then of battery of 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:26.250
 duration people are happy with them from 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.870
 7 inches 300 thousand pesos but it will be 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.080
 double the cost that one of those Chinese 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.000
 of 150 thousand or 300 thousand good for the 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.520
 that is in another country 300 thousand pesos 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.500
 they come to make 150 dollars 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.360
 approximately while the other 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.160
 economic as I said of $ 75 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.229
 then one says ah but it costs 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.510
 the double but it's still very economical 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:48.270
 then compared to the other then to the 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.820
 age because they are already 450 dollars then 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.320
 those of lennon I liked a lot but 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.970
 such for some the screen is very 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.410
 little me who work accessibility 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.060
 for people with disabilities the 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.099
 larger screen help for vision 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.770
 for the cognitive part for the part of 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:03.389
 fine motor skills but if the person has 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.860
 all your mobility and a whole small 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:06.630
 because it is more portable for the child 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:10.460
 for school for whatever you want 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:15.050
 then it's the taste it 's the taste 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:17.990
 I use this cell so tablet 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:21.889
 a semi tablet of a 13 that really 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:23.750
 has as 5.5 points screen 5.7 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:26.060
 inches something so it's really big 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.470
 also then there I go combining but 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.000
 when I need something that I'm going to 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.710
 relax as I tell you in the night re 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.440
 true I see it here while in the day 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.060
 I sail here easier then more 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.830
 that a technical advice tell 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.870
 specifications and everything was like in the 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.660
 part of the personal what I've seen what 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.759

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.289
