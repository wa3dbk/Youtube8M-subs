00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
this cake was the most difficult recipe

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.720 
this cake was the most difficult recipe
I<00:00:04.470> have<00:00:04.710> ever<00:00:05.009> made<00:00:05.310> thus<00:00:05.790> far<00:00:07.040> the<00:00:08.040> batter<00:00:08.309> was

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
I have ever made thus far the batter was

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.390 
I have ever made thus far the batter was
promising<00:00:09.450> and<00:00:09.690> really<00:00:10.650> seemed<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.219> be

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
promising and really seemed to be

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.810 
promising and really seemed to be
hinting<00:00:11.849> at<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.059> total<00:00:12.540> winner<00:00:13.309> then<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.340> removed

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
hinting at a total winner then I removed

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.140 
hinting at a total winner then I removed
it<00:00:14.940> from<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.179> oven<00:00:15.630> first<00:00:16.619> off<00:00:16.980> my<00:00:17.940> home

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
it from the oven first off my home

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.170 
it from the oven first off my home
smelled<00:00:18.570> like<00:00:18.810> cake<00:00:19.140> but<00:00:20.070> not<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.340> heavenly<00:00:20.970> as

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
smelled like cake but not a heavenly as

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.650 
smelled like cake but not a heavenly as
I<00:00:21.359> had<00:00:21.510> hoped<00:00:21.949> it<00:00:22.949> looked<00:00:23.189> okay<00:00:23.609> but<00:00:24.480> not

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
I had hoped it looked okay but not

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.330 
I had hoped it looked okay but not
mouth-watering<00:00:26.060> the<00:00:27.060> texture<00:00:27.570> was<00:00:27.920> okay<00:00:28.920> and

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
mouth-watering the texture was okay and

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.959 
mouth-watering the texture was okay and
the<00:00:30.240> flavor<00:00:30.570> was<00:00:30.840> good<00:00:31.219> but<00:00:32.219> certainly<00:00:32.669> not

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
the flavor was good but certainly not

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.450 
the flavor was good but certainly not
better<00:00:33.360> than<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.780> throw<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.200> all<00:00:34.410> in<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.100> stir

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460
