00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
didn't wasn't that much wasn't war

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.200 
didn't wasn't that much wasn't war
actually<00:01:04.589> but<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.159> was<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.760> different<00:01:05.790> way<00:01:06.180> I

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
actually but it was in a different way I

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.210

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
guess was he was taken by the loss of of

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.170 
guess was he was taken by the loss of of
his<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.420> income<00:01:13.040> so<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.610> know<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> fish<00:01:14.970> plant

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
closed down here in 93 i think it was or

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.160 
closed down here in 93 i think it was or
92<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.159> we<00:01:21.150> had<00:01:21.299> they<00:01:21.420> had<00:01:21.450> 500<00:01:22.049> employees
