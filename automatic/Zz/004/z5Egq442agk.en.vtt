00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:10.889
 develop and maintain a good mass 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.219
 muscle is important for several 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.410
 first and foremost, tonic muscles give 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.600
 the body looks healthy and thin 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.420
 besides since the muscle tissues have 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.670
 need so many calories develop the 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.519
 lean mass helps burn a lot more 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.980
 calories during physical activity taste 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.810
 and strong upper limbs help 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.399
 carry out activities more easily 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.010
 daily how to lift objects 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.890
 heavy and also favor better 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.950
 posture making them appear slimmer and 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.780
 slender have lower limbs 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.750
 strong instead can improve balance 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.760
 of the body and protects the joints in 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.300
 how lightens the load on the back 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.270
 and knees here are some things that is good 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.050
 know about muscles when you do 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.190
 weights or other resistance exercises 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.449
 stress the muscle with a load 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.550
 adequate 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.439
 better to do a few repetitions with a 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.510
 moderately difficult to weight 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.850
 raise rather than many 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.790
 repetitions with weights too light for 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.890
 muscle development and repair 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.310
 quality proteins must be taken 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.590
 eat a lot of fish poultry eggs 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.659
 dairy products with low fat and lean meats 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.360
 vegetable proteins such as 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.030
 beans and soy protein supplements 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.159
 in powder they are comfortable because they allow 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.520
 to increase the protein intake of 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.770
 meals according to their needs 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.140
 after exercise the muscles have 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.850
 need healthy carbohydrates and one 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.670
 small amount of protein per 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.680
 facilitate repair processes 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.259
 recover a jar of yogurt a 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.540
 smoothie a bowl of cereal and milk 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.310
 fruits are foods that favor the 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.640
 recovery after a training session 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.750
 of strength even though it might seem the 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.000
 contrary 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.130
 muscles do not turn into fat 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.229
 when we stop doing physical activity 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.990
 what happens is that the fibers 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.520
 muscles are reduced and in spaces that 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.469
 are 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.929
 create could accumulate a little 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:11.000
 fat for this muscles can 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.090
 seem a little softer when 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.700
 we stop training it is impossible that 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.099
 a muscle cell turns into 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.930
 a fat cell 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:23.720
 finally a message addressed to women 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.360
 don't be afraid to become too much 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.940
 big and muscular is a fear so much 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.190
 women as widespread as unfounded 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.170
 less development hormones 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.450
 muscle than men 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.060
 hence the exercises for strength not 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.360
 can make us become muscular like 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.360
 a man
