00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
fat well yes this is true however more

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.509 
fat well yes this is true however more
importantly<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:04.049> how<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.379> hormones<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.460> your

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.660 
importantly is how the hormones in your
body<00:01:06.000> are<00:01:06.450> acting<00:01:07.319> okay<00:01:07.670> specifically

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
body are acting okay specifically

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.010 
body are acting okay specifically
insulin<00:01:09.450> what<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.229> insulin<00:01:10.859> put<00:01:11.460> simply

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
insulin what is insulin put simply

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.080 
insulin what is insulin put simply
insulin<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.350> key<00:01:13.649> that<00:01:13.679> unlocks<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.759> cell

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
insulin is the key that unlocks a cell

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.840 
insulin is the key that unlocks a cell
and<00:01:15.350> allows<00:01:16.350> nutrients<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.039> step<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.640> get

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
and allows nutrients to step to get

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.090 
and allows nutrients to step to get
stored<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.420> absorbed<00:01:18.840> into<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.229> cell<00:01:19.560> okay

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
stored and absorbed into the cell okay

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.069 
stored and absorbed into the cell okay
so<00:01:20.729> if<00:01:20.969> you<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.270> lot<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.539> sugar<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:21.990> your

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
so if you have a lot of sugar in your

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:24.169 
so if you have a lot of sugar in your
blood<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.950> cells<00:01:23.280> will<00:01:23.460> open<00:01:23.789> up<00:01:23.880> because<00:01:23.999> of

00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:24.179 
blood the cells will open up because of

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:26.239 
blood the cells will open up because of
the<00:01:24.299> insulin<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.409> if<00:01:25.649> you<00:01:25.740> have<00:01:25.889> if

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:26.249 
the insulin and and if you have if

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:27.859 
the insulin and and if you have if
you're<00:01:26.429> eating<00:01:26.789> too<00:01:26.819> many<00:01:27.119> calories<00:01:27.450> and

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
you're eating too many calories and

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:28.789 
you're eating too many calories and
you're<00:01:27.960> going<00:01:28.079> to<00:01:28.139> start<00:01:28.259> storing<00:01:28.590> those

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
you're going to start storing those

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.059 
you're going to start storing those
nutrients<00:01:29.340> as<00:01:29.549> fat<00:01:29.909> okay<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.380> if<00:01:31.649> you<00:01:31.770> want<00:01:31.979> to

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:32.069 
nutrients as fat okay so if you want to

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:34.069 
nutrients as fat okay so if you want to
burn<00:01:32.310> fat<00:01:32.639> if<00:01:32.819> you<00:01:32.909> want<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.119> let<00:01:33.479> go<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.659> fat<00:01:33.929> or

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:40.459 
to not store fat then what you want to
do<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.520> control<00:01:38.909> insulin<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.689> one<00:01:40.289> of<00:01:40.409> the
