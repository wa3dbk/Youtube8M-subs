00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
the episodes I did before on on modding

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.440 
the episodes I did before on on modding
your<00:02:43.530> OS<00:02:43.830> 10<00:02:44.100> dock<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.850> saw<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.300> was<00:02:45.420> a

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
your OS 10 dock you saw that it was a

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.870 
your OS 10 dock you saw that it was a
little<00:02:46.440> bit<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:47.190> little<00:02:47.520> bit<00:02:47.610> of<00:02:47.670> steps

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
little bit of a little bit of steps

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.780 
little bit of a little bit of steps
involved<00:02:48.300> this<00:02:48.570> one<00:02:48.750> not<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:49.530> much<00:02:49.710> it's<00:02:50.250> super

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
involved this one not so much it's super

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.730 
involved this one not so much it's super
super<00:02:50.940> easy<00:02:51.200> so<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.320> first<00:02:52.500> thing<00:02:52.650> we're

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
super easy so the first thing we're

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.020 
super easy so the first thing we're
going<00:02:52.830> to<00:02:52.890> check<00:02:53.040> out<00:02:53.220> is<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.430> general<00:02:53.850> options

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
going to check out is a general options

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.300 
going to check out is a general options
and<00:02:54.480> nothing<00:02:55.350> much<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.500> see<00:02:55.770> here<00:02:56.010> but<00:02:56.160> one

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
and nothing much to see here but one

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.920 
and nothing much to see here but one
thing<00:02:56.460> I<00:02:56.550> did<00:02:56.700> select<00:02:56.970> was<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.300> run<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.570> startup

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
thing I did select was to run it startup

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.060 
thing I did select was to run it startup
so<00:02:58.080> that<00:02:58.230> way<00:02:58.380> I<00:02:58.410> don't<00:02:58.560> have<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.800> worry<00:02:59.010> about

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
so that way I don't have to worry about

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.740 
so that way I don't have to worry about
it<00:02:59.370> as<00:02:59.460> soon<00:02:59.580> as<00:02:59.670> my<00:02:59.790> OS<00:03:00.120> starts<00:03:00.390> up

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
it as soon as my OS starts up

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.700 
it as soon as my OS starts up
there's<00:03:00.990> my<00:03:01.140> dock<00:03:02.630> now<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.720> customization

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
there's my dock now the customization

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.710 
there's my dock now the customization
stuff<00:03:04.920> that<00:03:05.040> you<00:03:05.160> can<00:03:05.280> do<00:03:05.430> is<00:03:05.640> is<00:03:06.240> really<00:03:06.570> cool

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
stuff that you can do is is really cool

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.690 
stuff that you can do is is really cool
as<00:03:06.870> well<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.950> thing<00:03:08.130> that<00:03:08.250> I<00:03:08.280> loved<00:03:08.640> about

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
as well and the thing that I loved about

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.930 
as well and the thing that I loved about
this<00:03:09.060> was<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.660> themes<00:03:10.310> these<00:03:11.310> come<00:03:11.550> with<00:03:11.580> so

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
this was the themes these come with so

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.340 
this was the themes these come with so
many<00:03:12.030> themes<00:03:12.300> right<00:03:12.540> out<00:03:12.690> of<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.810> box<00:03:13.050> it's

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240
