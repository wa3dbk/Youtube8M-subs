people don't know
it's<00:01:11.820> kind<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.960> looks<00:01:13.170> like<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.730> blue<00:01:14.730> version

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060

notice

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
notice

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.560 
notice
it's

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
it's

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.200 
it's
sort<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.689> looks<00:01:31.110> like<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:32.159> blue<00:01:32.549> starring

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
sort of looks like a blue starring

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.300 
sort of looks like a blue starring
that's<00:01:34.390> the<00:01:34.540> only<00:01:34.720> way<00:01:34.960> I<00:01:34.990> can<00:01:35.260> describe<00:01:35.770> it

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
that's the only way I can describe it

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.570 
that's the only way I can describe it
really

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
really

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:48.600 
really
loose<00:01:38.210> time

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.760 

you<00:01:49.000> get<00:01:49.210> quite<00:01:49.630> a<00:01:49.660> bit<00:01:49.900> of<00:01:49.930> it<00:01:50.110> I<00:01:50.200> think<00:01:50.470> it<00:01:50.590> is

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
you get quite a bit of it I think it is

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.750 
you get quite a bit of it I think it is
the<00:01:51.070> same<00:01:51.280> mechanic<00:01:51.850> as<00:01:52.060> a<00:01:52.260> redstone<00:01:53.260> block

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
the same mechanic as a redstone block

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.070 
the same mechanic as a redstone block
when<00:01:54.760> you<00:01:54.850> break<00:01:55.090> it<00:01:55.270> it<00:01:55.420> gives<00:01:55.570> you<00:01:55.800> more<00:01:56.800> Oh

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
when you break it it gives you more Oh

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:06.530 
when you break it it gives you more Oh
about<00:01:59.080> five<00:01:59.500> or<00:01:59.860> four<00:02:00.160> I<00:02:00.190> think<00:02:00.490> it<00:02:00.640> is

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.120 

right<00:02:07.080> well<00:02:07.380> there's<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.620> couple<00:02:07.800> of<00:02:07.950> things

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
right well there's a couple of things

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.180 
right well there's a couple of things
you<00:02:08.310> can<00:02:08.340> do<00:02:08.640> with<00:02:08.910> this

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.700 

the<00:02:14.550> first<00:02:14.880> thing<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:16.380> can<00:02:16.500> do<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:18.120> this

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
the first thing you can do is this

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.180 
the first thing you can do is this
just<00:02:20.370> place<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.930> lapis-lazuli<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.830> doesn't

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
just place a lapis-lazuli it doesn't

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.730 
just place a lapis-lazuli it doesn't
matter<00:02:23.340> how<00:02:23.520> much<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:24.120> add<00:02:24.840> some<00:02:25.230> wool<00:02:25.440> and

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
matter how much and add some wool and

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.170 
matter how much and add some wool and
they'll<00:02:26.730> be<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.330> result<00:02:27.750> blue<00:02:28.320> wool<00:02:28.680> I

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
they'll be the result blue wool I

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.730 
they'll be the result blue wool I
already<00:02:30.180> made<00:02:30.360> some<00:02:30.390> earlier<00:02:30.990> just<00:02:31.290> so<00:02:31.470> my

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
already made some earlier just so my

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.910 
already made some earlier just so my
inventory<00:02:32.610> doesn't<00:02:33.210> get<00:02:33.420> scrambled<00:02:34.230> up<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:34.860> I

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
inventory doesn't get scrambled up so I

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.870 
inventory doesn't get scrambled up so I
can<00:02:35.070> easily<00:02:35.190> show<00:02:35.610> you

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.810 

so<00:02:39.450> this<00:02:39.660> makes<00:02:39.990> blue<00:02:40.530> wall<00:02:40.830> which<00:02:41.130> looks<00:02:41.490> very

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
so this makes blue wall which looks very

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.320 
so this makes blue wall which looks very
nice

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.059 

oops

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.320 

beautiful

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
blue block

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.030 
blue block
so<00:02:59.019> it's<00:02:59.200> not<00:02:59.379> actually

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
so it's not actually

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.980 
so it's not actually
it's<00:03:01.220> very<00:03:01.580> durable<00:03:03.400> it<00:03:04.400> looks<00:03:04.760> nicer

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
it's very durable it looks nicer

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.950 
it's very durable it looks nicer

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
then there's this the lapis lazuli block

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.380 
then there's this the lapis lazuli block
now<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:10.740> get<00:03:11.130> this<00:03:11.370> by<00:03:11.700> placing

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.350 

not<00:03:14.930> for

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360

and nine walks like so in the crafting
table

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
table

so<00:03:24.490> we'll<00:03:24.730> just<00:03:24.850> take<00:03:25.210> that<00:03:25.420> out

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
so we'll just take that out

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.360 
so we'll just take that out
it<00:03:27.060> is<00:03:27.540> pretty<00:03:28.320> much<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.680> same<00:03:28.860> thing<00:03:29.130> as<00:03:29.250> the

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
it is pretty much the same thing as the

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.110 
it is pretty much the same thing as the
wall<00:03:29.580> of<00:03:29.850> although<00:03:30.300> to<00:03:30.810> me<00:03:30.960> it<00:03:31.080> looks<00:03:31.260> ugly<00:03:31.410> or

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
wall of although to me it looks ugly or

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.300 
wall of although to me it looks ugly or
if<00:03:33.120> you<00:03:33.360> have<00:03:33.630> a<00:03:33.660> comparison<00:03:34.260> there<00:03:34.470> and

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
if you have a comparison there and

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:43.940 
if you have a comparison there and
people<00:03:35.730> can<00:03:35.970> see<00:03:36.120> that<00:03:36.300> from<00:03:36.390> YouTube

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.990 

they<00:03:44.580> I<00:03:45.090> like<00:03:45.900> this<00:03:46.050> one<00:03:46.489> this<00:03:47.489> one<00:03:47.760> would<00:03:47.970> be

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
they I like this one this one would be

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.820 
they I like this one this one would be
good<00:03:48.360> for

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.960 

our<00:03:52.950> special<00:03:53.730> types<00:03:53.940> of<00:03:54.120> decoration<00:03:54.630> I<00:03:54.750> guess

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.910 

now<00:03:57.330> the<00:03:57.420> other<00:03:57.780> thing<00:03:58.200> you<00:03:58.710> can<00:03:58.920> do<00:03:59.220> with<00:03:59.940> the

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
now the other thing you can do with the

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.350 
now the other thing you can do with the
lapis<00:04:01.920> is<00:04:02.160> to<00:04:02.610> die<00:04:03.000> sheep<00:04:04.640> so<00:04:05.640> you<00:04:06.000> can<00:04:06.150> dye<00:04:06.300> the

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
lapis is to die sheep so you can dye the

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.010 
lapis is to die sheep so you can dye the
wool<00:04:06.960> of<00:04:07.290> sheep<00:04:07.620> but<00:04:08.370> I<00:04:08.880> don't<00:04:09.450> know<00:04:09.600> if<00:04:09.720> some

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.450 
wool of sheep but I don't know if some
people<00:04:10.050> know<00:04:10.440> that<00:04:10.620> you<00:04:10.710> can<00:04:10.830> actually<00:04:11.040> die

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.460 
people know that you can actually die

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.600 
people know that you can actually die
the<00:04:11.520> Sheep<00:04:12.440> which<00:04:13.440> is<00:04:13.650> pretty<00:04:13.950> cool

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
the Sheep which is pretty cool

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.810

you've<00:05:37.170> actually<00:05:37.880> gotten<00:05:38.990> three<00:05:39.990> in<00:05:40.200> this

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
you've actually gotten three in this

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.939 
you've actually gotten three in this
case<00:05:40.640> three<00:05:41.900> blocks<00:05:42.900> of<00:05:43.080> walk<00:05:43.290> blue<00:05:43.650> wall<00:05:43.830> out

one<00:05:45.280> cheat

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.490 

which<00:05:50.040> is<00:05:50.460> efficient<00:05:51.240> enough<00:05:51.450> so<00:05:51.960> if<00:05:52.140> you<00:05:52.320> have

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
which is efficient enough so if you have

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.080 
which is efficient enough so if you have
say<00:05:52.890> a<00:05:52.920> sheep<00:05:53.430> farm

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
say a sheep farm

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.360 
say a sheep farm
you<00:05:54.810> can<00:05:55.020> color<00:05:55.230> each<00:05:55.470> one<00:05:55.710> of<00:05:55.830> them<00:05:56.070> with

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
you can color each one of them with

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.430 
you can color each one of them with
lapis<00:05:56.610> lazuli<00:05:56.910> or<00:05:57.360> another<00:05:57.690> dye<00:05:57.960> by<00:05:58.200> the<00:05:58.260> way

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
lapis lazuli or another dye by the way

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.770 
lapis lazuli or another dye by the way
all<00:05:58.650> dyes<00:05:58.950> you<00:05:59.340> can<00:05:59.490> use<00:05:59.700> on<00:06:00.000> the<00:06:00.330> Sheep<00:06:00.570> to

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
all dyes you can use on the Sheep to

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.410 
all dyes you can use on the Sheep to
change<00:06:01.020> their<00:06:01.230> color<00:06:01.440> and<00:06:01.850> then<00:06:02.850> you<00:06:03.000> can<00:06:03.180> take

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.420 
change their color and then you can take

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:11.270 
change their color and then you can take
their<00:06:03.600> wool
