00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
last real permit yeah I just measure it

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.830 
last real permit yeah I just measure it
based<00:02:24.190> on<00:02:24.370> my<00:02:24.430> big<00:02:24.730> chop<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.180> over<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.480> my<00:02:25.630> big

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
based on my big chop and over to my big

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.470 
based on my big chop and over to my big
chop<00:02:25.990> my<00:02:26.200> hair<00:02:26.440> was<00:02:26.680> shaped<00:02:27.520> was<00:02:27.910> shorter<00:02:28.329> in

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
chop my hair was shaped was shorter in

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.370 
chop my hair was shaped was shorter in
the<00:02:28.510> back<00:02:28.659> so<00:02:29.200> more<00:02:29.470> new<00:02:29.650> focus

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
the back so more new focus

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.510 
the back so more new focus
there<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:30.830> I'm<00:02:30.890> just<00:02:31.040> like<00:02:31.160> I'm<00:02:31.310> just<00:02:31.340> gonna

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
there and I'm just like I'm just gonna

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.820 
there and I'm just like I'm just gonna
use<00:02:31.820> the<00:02:32.360> big<00:02:32.540> chop<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:33.140> when<00:02:33.560> I<00:02:33.590> actually

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
use the big chop and when I actually

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.590 
use the big chop and when I actually
went<00:02:34.220> natural<00:02:34.640> as<00:02:34.730> my<00:02:34.880> measure<00:02:35.060> points<00:02:35.480> some

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
went natural as my measure points some

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.570 
went natural as my measure points some
people<00:02:35.900> choose<00:02:36.080> to<00:02:36.140> do<00:02:36.410> differently<00:02:36.800> and<00:02:37.310> then

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580
