to look for the fact that the lid if

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.680 
to look for the fact that the lid if
Ralph<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:47.010> but<00:00:47.460> still<00:00:47.640> loose

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
Ralph it is but still loose

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.840 
Ralph it is but still loose
well<00:00:49.079> filtered<00:00:49.500> will<00:00:49.710> stop<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.370> aroma<00:00:50.820> from

pouring is that the handle the opening
and<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.270> start<00:01:06.600> up<00:01:06.720> all<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> same<00:01:07.500> line

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
and the start up all on the same line

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.340 
and the start up all on the same line
and<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.820> only<00:01:08.850> way<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.299> look<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.990> look<00:01:10.020> for

and the only way to look to look for
that<00:01:10.470> characteristic<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.340> turn<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.880> table

though of course certain pots you can

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.780 
though of course certain pots you can
expect<00:01:18.570> for<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.979> look<00:01:19.979> for<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.310> quality

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
expect for the look for that quality

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.679 
expect for the look for that quality
because<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.619> specific<00:01:22.619> design<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.689> the

because of the specific design of it the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.870 
because of the specific design of it the
other<00:01:24.900> thing<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.500> need<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.860> look<00:01:25.979> for<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.520> the

other thing you need to look for is the
future<00:01:27.360> inside<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.020> teapot<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.790> pot<00:01:30.119> you

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
future inside the teapot in this pot you

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.370 
future inside the teapot in this pot you
have<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.780> nested<00:01:31.350> round<00:01:31.740> ball<00:01:32.100> field<00:01:32.490> kubbs

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
teapot and it duty really liked it

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.520 
teapot and it duty really liked it
because<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.820> its<00:01:50.970> color<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.479> its<00:01:51.659> shape<00:01:51.930> but

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
because of its color of its shape but

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.980 
because of its color of its shape but
what<00:01:52.740> it's<00:01:52.890> more<00:01:53.040> important<00:01:53.670> really<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.630> to

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
what it's more important really is to

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.870 
what it's more important really is to
choose<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.290> pot<00:01:55.680> that's<00:01:55.920> suitable<00:01:56.460> for<00:01:56.610> the

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
tea that they want to do so for a pot

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.720 
tea that they want to do so for a pot
like<00:01:59.430> this<00:01:59.729> without<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.630> filter<00:02:01.399> we

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
like this without a filter we

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
like this without a filter we
to<00:02:02.970> use<00:02:03.150> it<00:02:03.360> for<00:02:03.570> brewing<00:02:03.900> smaller<00:02:04.530> tea<00:02:04.890> leaves

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
to use it for brewing smaller tea leaves

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.900 
to use it for brewing smaller tea leaves
but<00:02:06.750> with<00:02:07.050> a<00:02:07.080> pot<00:02:07.380> like<00:02:07.590> this<00:02:07.620> with<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.250> nested

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
but with a pot like this with a nested

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.900 
but with a pot like this with a nested
 filter<00:02:10.140> we<00:02:10.590> tend<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.950> use<00:02:11.220> this<00:02:11.490> for

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
 filter we tend to use this for

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.810 
 filter we tend to use this for
larger<00:02:12.420> tini<00:02:12.800> this<00:02:13.800> is<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.070> ensure<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.460> the

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
larger tini this is to ensure that the

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.690 
larger tini this is to ensure that the
TV<00:02:15.090> does<00:02:15.480> not<00:02:15.690> block<00:02:15.990> these<00:02:16.530> stuff<00:02:16.980> when<00:02:17.550> you

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
TV does not block these stuff when you

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.990 
TV does not block these stuff when you
pour<00:02:17.940> tea<00:02:18.210> out<00:02:18.890> now<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.400> other<00:02:20.520> thing<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.970> look

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000
