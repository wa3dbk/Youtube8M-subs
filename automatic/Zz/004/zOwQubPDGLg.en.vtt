00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
400 bucks or something like that because

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.160 
400 bucks or something like that because

we you know we're making a new diffuser
for<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.949> pop-up<00:00:23.189> flash<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.580> new<00:00:23.910> Sony<00:00:24.210> puffer

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600

for the pop-up flash a new Sony puffer
diffuser<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.289> then<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:25.769> just<00:00:26.130> thought<00:00:26.279> well

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
diffuser and then I just thought well

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.950 
diffuser and then I just thought well
since<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:26.760> got<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.910> new<00:00:27.090> toy<00:00:27.300> laying<00:00:27.599> around<00:00:27.720> I'm

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
since I got a new toy laying around I'm

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.320 
since I got a new toy laying around I'm
gonna<00:00:28.080> play<00:00:28.289> with<00:00:28.320> this<00:00:28.560> thing<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:29.179> to<00:00:30.179> tell

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.220 
camera on and I think it has something
to<00:00:35.250> do<00:00:35.610> with<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.969> Sony<00:00:36.270> line<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.899> let<00:00:36.989> me<00:00:37.079> tell

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.560 
eighth of a second handheld and its tack
sharp<00:00:51.230> because<00:00:52.230> rather<00:00:52.649> than<00:00:52.949> have<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
sharp because rather than have the

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.689 
sharp because rather than have the
mechanism<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.780> lens<00:00:55.020> which<00:00:55.520> Nikon<00:00:56.520> and

mechanism in the lens which Nikon and

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.240 
mechanism in the lens which Nikon and
Canon<00:00:56.730> typically<00:00:57.420> do<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.960> has<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.500> camera

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
Canon typically do it has the camera

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.410 
Canon typically do it has the camera
stabilization<00:00:59.789> in<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.329> body<00:01:00.510> number<00:01:01.199> two

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
stabilization in the body number two

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.359 
stabilization in the body number two
it's<00:01:03.420> got<00:01:03.600> some<00:01:03.870> really<00:01:04.049> cool<00:01:04.199> well<00:01:05.010> first<00:01:05.250> of

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
it's got some really cool well first of

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.370 
it's got some really cool well first of
all<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.610> auto<00:01:05.790> mode<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.450> green<00:01:06.780> dummy<00:01:07.110> mode

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
all the auto mode this green dummy mode

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.950 
all the auto mode this green dummy mode
I<00:01:07.619> think<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.240> don't<00:01:09.450> know<00:01:09.570> for

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
I think this is a this I don't know for

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.690 
I think this is a this I don't know for
like<00:01:10.229> wedding<00:01:10.560> photographers<00:01:11.159> if<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.520> see

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
like wedding photographers if you see

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.920 
like wedding photographers if you see
amateurs<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.360> they're<00:01:12.450> going<00:01:12.630> around<00:01:12.720> with

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
amateurs and they're going around with

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.990 
amateurs and they're going around with
Sony's<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.530> auto<00:01:13.710> mode<00:01:14.010> it's<00:01:14.729> kind<00:01:14.939> of

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
Sony's in the auto mode it's kind of

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.510 
Sony's in the auto mode it's kind of
crazy<00:01:15.180> because<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.110> Sony<00:01:16.799> actually

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
crazy because the the Sony actually

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.120 
crazy because the the Sony actually
really<00:01:17.939> does<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> lot<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.509> great<00:01:19.229> calculations

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
really does a lot of great calculations

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.010 
really does a lot of great calculations
under<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.939> auto<00:01:21.090> mode<00:01:21.330> but<00:01:21.540> when<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.689> put<00:01:21.930> it

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
under the auto mode but when I put it

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.840 
under the auto mode but when I put it
into<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.380> P<00:01:22.560> mode<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.670> what's

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
into the P mode this is what's

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.090 
into the P mode this is what's
interesting<00:01:24.110> when<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.170> go<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.619> flash<00:01:25.860> right

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
interesting when I go to the flash right

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.480 
interesting when I go to the flash right
here<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:27.030> can<00:01:27.930> instantly<00:01:28.380> go<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.650> Wireless<00:01:29.250> and

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
here I can instantly go to Wireless and

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.609 
here I can instantly go to Wireless and
that's<00:01:29.820> that's<00:01:30.360> like<00:01:30.659> really<00:01:30.900> cool<00:01:31.229> cuz<00:01:31.500> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
that's that's like really cool cuz the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.260 
that's that's like really cool cuz the
minute<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:31.950> put<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.250> on<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:33.090> guy

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
minute I put it on that and this guy

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.160 
minute I put it on that and this guy
goes<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.630> wireless<00:01:34.110> now<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.740> take<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:35.340> guy<00:01:35.549> off

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
goes on wireless now I take this guy off

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.490 
goes on wireless now I take this guy off
okay<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.380> then<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:38.250> can<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:39.030> basically<00:01:39.500> this

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
okay and then I can just basically this

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.260 
okay and then I can just basically this
thing<00:01:40.710> will<00:01:40.829> pop<00:01:41.009> up<00:01:41.280> but<00:01:41.579> it'll<00:01:41.729> sync<00:01:42.090> at<00:01:42.210> a

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
thing will pop up but it'll sync at a

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.300 
thing will pop up but it'll sync at a
different<00:01:42.600> rate<00:01:42.750> than<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.140> guy<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.009> see

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
different rate than this guy so you see

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.310 
different rate than this guy so you see
how<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.460> lights<00:01:44.759> going<00:01:44.970> on<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.210> then<00:01:45.840> now<00:01:46.020> it

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
how that lights going on and then now it

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.550 
how that lights going on and then now it
does<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:48.210> flash<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.810> this<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.320> unit

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
does the the flash on this this unit

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.410 
does the the flash on this this unit
with<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.579> all<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.759> did<00:01:50.909> was<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.360> just

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
with that and all I did was I just

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.830 
with that and all I did was I just
