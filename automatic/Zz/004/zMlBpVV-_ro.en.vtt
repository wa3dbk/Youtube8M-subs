front as well needs to be a piece and
you<00:00:59.699> have<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.000> below<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.390> display<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.750> have

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
you have the below the display you have

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.530 
you have the below the display you have
the<00:01:01.290> keys<00:01:02.040> menu<00:01:03.030> key<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.900> tmd<00:01:04.470> back<00:01:04.680> key

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
the keys menu key of tmd back key

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.640 
the keys menu key of tmd back key
there's<00:01:06.540> nothing<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.990> left<00:01:07.170> side<00:01:07.350> is

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
there's nothing on the left side is

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.010 
there's nothing on the left side is
pretty<00:01:07.830> plain

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
dual sim phones you have a dual sim dual

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.069 
dual sim phones you have a dual sim dual
micro<00:01:31.709> sim<00:01:31.890> slots<00:01:32.159> on<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.369> inside<00:01:32.899> if<00:01:33.899> you

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
micro sim slots on the inside if you

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.219 
micro sim slots on the inside if you
open<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.409> back<00:01:34.590> cover<00:01:34.619> as<00:01:35.219> a<00:01:35.280> 225<00:01:35.939> MH<00:01:36.390> battery

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
open the back cover as a 225 MH battery

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.590 
open the back cover as a 225 MH battery
on<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.469> inside<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.270> 8gb<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.450> internal

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
on the inside and 8gb of internal

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.920 
on the inside and 8gb of internal
storage<00:01:39.899> let's<00:01:40.469> quickly<00:01:40.619> show<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.130> that

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.260 

so<00:01:45.470> it's<00:01:45.800> got<00:01:45.920> about<00:01:46.100> 5<00:01:46.280> i'm<00:01:46.580> 60<00:01:46.910> B<00:01:47.030> of<00:01:47.120> free

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
so it's got about 5 i'm 60 B of free

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.200 
so it's got about 5 i'm 60 B of free
space<00:01:47.540> and<00:01:47.810> also<00:01:48.710> has<00:01:48.980> American<00:01:49.760> support<00:01:50.060> up

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
space and also has American support up

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.890 
space and also has American support up
to<00:01:50.240> 32gb<00:01:50.840> and<00:01:51.250> it's<00:01:52.250> got<00:01:52.400> 1gb<00:01:52.820> of<00:01:52.850> ram<00:01:53.120> and<00:01:53.360> the

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
to 32gb and it's got 1gb of ram and the

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.020 
to 32gb and it's got 1gb of ram and the
display<00:01:54.200> on<00:01:54.230> this<00:01:54.500> is<00:01:54.650> actually<00:01:54.950> a<00:01:54.980> 720p<00:01:55.520> panel

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
display on this is actually a 720p panel

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.170 
display on this is actually a 720p panel
so<00:01:56.330> that's<00:01:56.570> a<00:01:57.280> something<00:01:58.280> different<00:01:59.120> from<00:01:59.270> the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
so that's a something different from the

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.710 
so that's a something different from the
s650

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
s650

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.190 
s650
and<00:02:03.810> uh

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
and uh

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.130 
and uh
so<00:02:05.799> that's<00:02:06.009> about<00:02:06.130> it<00:02:06.280> so<00:02:06.640> that's<00:02:07.570> a<00:02:07.869> quick

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
so that's about it so that's a quick

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.430 
so that's about it so that's a quick
