00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
cable connection well the answer is from

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.059 
cable connection well the answer is from
the<00:02:10.700> internet<00:02:11.239> with<00:02:11.750> Apple<00:02:12.110> TV<00:02:12.409> your<00:02:12.620> content

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
the internet with Apple TV your content

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.130 
the internet with Apple TV your content
is<00:02:13.159> downloaded<00:02:13.940> from<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.239> web<00:02:14.420> or<00:02:14.629> from<00:02:14.959> your

is downloaded from the web or from your

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.850 
is downloaded from the web or from your
computer<00:02:15.319> that's<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.400> key<00:02:16.670> to<00:02:17.209> Apple<00:02:17.569> TV<00:02:17.900> when

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
computer that's the key to Apple TV when

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.110 
computer that's the key to Apple TV when
I<00:02:18.890> first<00:02:19.220> set<00:02:19.370> up<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.550> Apple<00:02:19.849> TV

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
I first set up the Apple TV

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.300 
I first set up the Apple TV
the<00:02:20.540> very<00:02:20.840> first<00:02:21.140> setup<00:02:21.319> screens<00:02:21.709> asked<00:02:22.129> me<00:02:22.220> to

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
the very first setup screens asked me to

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.970 
the very first setup screens asked me to
find<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.760> local<00:02:22.970> Wi-Fi<00:02:23.269> network<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.019> join<00:02:24.800> it

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
find the local Wi-Fi network and join it

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.860 
find the local Wi-Fi network and join it
so<00:02:25.220> right<00:02:25.430> out<00:02:25.550> of<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.700> box<00:02:25.909> then<00:02:26.209> we<00:02:26.360> could

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
so right out of the box then we could

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.899 
so right out of the box then we could
start<00:02:26.989> to<00:02:27.200> download<00:02:27.379> TV<00:02:27.950> shows<00:02:28.190> movies<00:02:28.459> and

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:28.909 
start to download TV shows movies and

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.000 
start to download TV shows movies and
video<00:02:29.209> from<00:02:29.389> the<00:02:29.480> web<00:02:29.599> but<00:02:30.349> that's<00:02:30.530> just<00:02:30.709> one

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
video from the web but that's just one

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.030 
video from the web but that's just one
of<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.189> content<00:02:31.700> sources<00:02:32.030> for<00:02:32.329> Apple<00:02:32.659> TV

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
of the content sources for Apple TV

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.200 
of the content sources for Apple TV
anything<00:02:34.040> we<00:02:34.159> have<00:02:34.310> on<00:02:34.489> our<00:02:34.519> computer

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
anything we have on our computer

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.540 
anything we have on our computer
can<00:02:35.330> also<00:02:35.600> be<00:02:35.960> viewed<00:02:36.170> on<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.500> Apple<00:02:36.860> TV<00:02:36.890> which

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
can also be viewed on the Apple TV which

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.130 
can also be viewed on the Apple TV which
means<00:02:37.580> we<00:02:37.940> can<00:02:38.090> watch<00:02:38.240> our<00:02:38.420> own<00:02:38.570> home<00:02:38.810> movies

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
means we can watch our own home movies

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.170 
means we can watch our own home movies
listen<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:39.680> our<00:02:39.800> music<00:02:39.950> or<00:02:40.280> view<00:02:40.640> our<00:02:40.760> photos

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
listen to our music or view our photos

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.480 
listen to our music or view our photos
as<00:02:41.420> well<00:02:41.660> so<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.590> second<00:02:42.950> thing<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.190> did<00:02:43.220> in

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
as well so the second thing I did in

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.760 
as well so the second thing I did in
configuring<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.090> Apple<00:02:44.390> TV<00:02:44.660> was<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.350> sync<00:02:45.620> it

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
configuring the Apple TV was to sync it

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.100 
configuring the Apple TV was to sync it
with<00:02:45.800> my<00:02:46.130> Mac<00:02:46.460> or<00:02:46.790> more<00:02:47.030> specifically<00:02:47.510> with

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
with my Mac or more specifically with

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.650 
with my Mac or more specifically with
iTunes<00:02:48.770> which<00:02:49.070> is<00:02:49.220> running<00:02:49.520> on<00:02:49.670> my<00:02:49.880> Mac<00:02:50.120> now<00:02:50.630> I

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
iTunes which is running on my Mac now I

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.360 
iTunes which is running on my Mac now I
could<00:02:50.930> have<00:02:50.960> synced<00:02:51.290> it<00:02:51.380> to<00:02:51.500> my<00:02:51.590> PC<00:02:52.010> as<00:02:52.160> well<00:02:52.190> as

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
could have synced it to my PC as well as

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.190 
could have synced it to my PC as well as
long<00:02:52.700> as<00:02:52.850> I<00:02:52.910> was<00:02:53.030> syncing<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:53.420> iTunes<00:02:53.990> and<00:02:54.110> it

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
long as I was syncing to iTunes and it

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.960 
long as I was syncing to iTunes and it
would<00:02:54.320> work<00:02:54.470> just<00:02:54.500> as<00:02:54.890> well<00:02:54.950> but<00:02:55.280> personally

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
would work just as well but personally

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.700 
would work just as well but personally
my<00:02:56.090> Mac<00:02:56.330> is<00:02:56.510> where<00:02:56.690> I<00:02:56.720> keep<00:02:56.930> all<00:02:57.110> of<00:02:57.170> my<00:02:57.320> media

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
my Mac is where I keep all of my media

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.620 
my Mac is where I keep all of my media
files<00:02:57.980> so<00:02:58.400> it<00:02:58.490> made<00:02:58.610> sense<00:02:58.850> for<00:02:59.000> me<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.210> sync<00:02:59.540> it

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
files so it made sense for me to sync it

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.260 
files so it made sense for me to sync it
to<00:02:59.990> my<00:03:00.110> Mac<00:03:00.350> but<00:03:00.920> now<00:03:01.070> all<00:03:01.310> of<00:03:01.580> my<00:03:01.700> media<00:03:02.090> is

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
to my Mac but now all of my media is

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.650 
to my Mac but now all of my media is
available<00:03:03.020> on<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.710> Apple<00:03:03.890> TV

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
available on the Apple TV

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.420 
available on the Apple TV
setting<00:03:05.660> up<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.870> Apple<00:03:06.170> TV<00:03:06.260> was<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.620> snap<00:03:07.100> it

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
setting up the Apple TV was a snap it

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.250 
setting up the Apple TV was a snap it
only<00:03:07.580> took<00:03:07.820> a<00:03:08.000> few<00:03:08.030> minutes<00:03:08.330> to<00:03:08.750> configure

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
only took a few minutes to configure

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.200 
only took a few minutes to configure
things<00:03:09.470> and<00:03:09.770> now<00:03:10.220> I've<00:03:10.400> got<00:03:10.610> a<00:03:10.640> lot<00:03:10.940> of<00:03:10.970> media

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
things and now I've got a lot of media

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.940 
things and now I've got a lot of media
on<00:03:11.420> my<00:03:11.570> Mac<00:03:11.810> so<00:03:12.020> syncing<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.590> first<00:03:12.770> time

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
on my Mac so syncing the first time

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.680 
on my Mac so syncing the first time
actually<00:03:13.100> took<00:03:13.370> me<00:03:13.550> a<00:03:13.580> few<00:03:13.850> hours<00:03:13.880> for<00:03:14.600> the

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
actually took me a few hours for the

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.570 
actually took me a few hours for the
files<00:03:14.930> to<00:03:15.140> move<00:03:15.290> across<00:03:15.560> but<00:03:16.220> then<00:03:16.400> you<00:03:16.490> have

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
files to move across but then you have

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.000 
files to move across but then you have
to<00:03:16.700> understand<00:03:17.030> I've<00:03:17.510> got<00:03:17.720> over<00:03:17.930> 4,000<00:03:18.680> songs

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
to understand I've got over 4,000 songs

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.470 
to understand I've got over 4,000 songs
alone<00:03:19.340> so<00:03:19.520> that's<00:03:19.670> a<00:03:19.760> lot<00:03:19.940> of<00:03:20.060> data<00:03:20.330> to

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
alone so that's a lot of data to

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.210 
alone so that's a lot of data to
transfer<00:03:21.050> but<00:03:21.440> that<00:03:21.590> was<00:03:21.710> just<00:03:21.890> the<00:03:22.010> first

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
transfer but that was just the first

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.490 
transfer but that was just the first
time<00:03:22.570> subsequent<00:03:23.570> syncs<00:03:23.870> will<00:03:24.020> be<00:03:24.110> a<00:03:24.140> lot

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
time subsequent syncs will be a lot

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.770 
time subsequent syncs will be a lot
faster<00:03:24.530> but<00:03:25.490> the<00:03:25.580> hardware<00:03:25.790> is<00:03:26.030> now<00:03:26.180> ready<00:03:26.690> to

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
faster but the hardware is now ready to

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.510 
faster but the hardware is now ready to
go<00:03:27.050> and<00:03:27.380> we've<00:03:27.680> barely<00:03:27.980> scratched<00:03:28.160> the

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
go and we've barely scratched the

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.670 
go and we've barely scratched the
surface<00:03:28.730> of<00:03:29.030> Apple<00:03:29.720> TV<00:03:30.020> we're<00:03:30.260> gonna<00:03:30.350> take<00:03:30.650> a

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
surface of Apple TV we're gonna take a

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.140 
surface of Apple TV we're gonna take a
look<00:03:30.800> at<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.010> interface<00:03:31.400> which<00:03:31.940> is<00:03:31.970> the

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
look at the interface which is the

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.910 
look at the interface which is the
software<00:03:32.630> that<00:03:32.750> makes<00:03:33.020> apple<00:03:33.230> TV<00:03:33.680> so

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
software that makes apple TV so
