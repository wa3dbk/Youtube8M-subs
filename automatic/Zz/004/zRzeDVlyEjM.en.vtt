the<00:01:45.659> wiser<00:01:45.840> bearings<00:01:46.229> will<00:01:46.320> break<00:01:46.530> any<00:01:46.710> ride

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
the wiser bearings will break any ride

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.069 
the wiser bearings will break any ride
but<00:01:48.119> let<00:01:48.570> me<00:01:48.630> show<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.840> how<00:01:48.869> it's<00:01:49.049> done

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
straight and keep it all good so first

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.910 
straight and keep it all good so first
bearings<00:02:21.540> in<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:22.440> make<00:02:22.620> sure<00:02:22.739> use<00:02:22.860> your

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
bearings in to make sure use your

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.430 
bearings in to make sure use your
bearing<00:02:23.190> spacer<00:02:23.840> you<00:02:24.840> don't<00:02:25.019> use<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.170> bearing

bearing spacer you don't use a bearing
spacer<00:02:25.560> your<00:02:25.890> bearings<00:02:26.190> will<00:02:26.280> bend<00:02:26.430> in<00:02:26.610> and

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
spacer your bearings will bend in and

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.000 
spacer your bearings will bend in and
break<00:02:26.940> as<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.209> ride<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:28.349> make<00:02:28.500> sure<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.739> put

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
break as you ride so make sure you put

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.009 
break as you ride so make sure you put
that<00:02:29.129> in<00:02:29.310> there<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:30.540> then<00:02:30.629> we<00:02:30.750> got<00:02:30.840> our

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
that in there and then we got our

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.350 
that in there and then we got our
bearing<00:02:31.319> here<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:33.440> set<00:02:34.440> this<00:02:34.560> in<00:02:34.739> here<00:02:35.360> make

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
bearing here so I set this in here make

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.610 
bearing here so I set this in here make
sure<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.599> get<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.780> centered<00:02:37.080> in<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.230> vise<00:02:37.440> as

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
sure you get it centered in the vise as

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.550 
sure you get it centered in the vise as
best<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:37.890> can<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:39.690> you're<00:02:39.810> slowly<00:02:40.140> tighten

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
best you can and you're slowly tighten

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.180 
best you can and you're slowly tighten
the<00:02:40.650> wheel<00:02:40.829> or<00:02:41.790> sorry<00:02:42.030> slow<00:02:42.150> titans<00:02:42.510> of<00:02:42.540> ice

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
the wheel or sorry slow titans of ice

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.920 
the wheel or sorry slow titans of ice
until<00:02:44.190> starts<00:02:44.579> the<00:02:44.670> pressure<00:02:44.849> wheel<00:02:45.090> in<00:02:45.299> now

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
until starts the pressure wheel in now

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.390 
until starts the pressure wheel in now
right<00:02:46.110> now<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.290> think<00:02:46.410> I'm<00:02:46.680> going<00:02:46.860> crooked<00:02:47.069> so

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
right now I think I'm going crooked so

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.839 
right now I think I'm going crooked so
I'm<00:02:47.459> going<00:02:47.579> to<00:02:47.640> back<00:02:47.760> this<00:02:47.940> off<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.480> check<00:02:49.849> as

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
I'm going to back this off and check as

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.930 
I'm going to back this off and check as
you<00:02:51.000> can<00:02:51.090> see<00:02:51.299> it's<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.810> little<00:02:52.019> crooked<00:02:52.849> so<00:02:53.849> I'm

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
you can see it's a little crooked so I'm

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.270 
you can see it's a little crooked so I'm
going<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.120> try<00:02:54.269> to<00:02:54.299> adjust<00:02:54.450> that<00:02:55.220> Center<00:02:56.220> it

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
going to try to adjust that Center it

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:04.819 
going to try to adjust that Center it
better<00:02:56.430> on<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.579> vice<00:02:56.819> and<00:02:57.120> try<00:02:57.329> again<00:03:03.650> and<00:03:04.650> so

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
better on the vice and try again and so

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.500 
better on the vice and try again and so
it's<00:03:04.980> kind<00:03:05.160> of<00:03:05.190> take<00:03:05.819> your<00:03:05.940> time<00:03:06.120> go<00:03:06.359> a<00:03:06.390> little

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
it's kind of take your time go a little

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.880 
it's kind of take your time go a little
bit<00:03:06.660> of<00:03:06.690> time<00:03:06.930> make<00:03:07.200> sure<00:03:07.230> you're<00:03:07.530> not<00:03:07.620> going

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
bit of time make sure you're not going

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.339 
bit of time make sure you're not going
to<00:03:08.040> crooked<00:03:08.370> I<00:03:08.609> hear<00:03:09.390> it's<00:03:09.510> still<00:03:09.599> crooked<00:03:09.930> so

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
to crooked I hear it's still crooked so

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.289 
to crooked I hear it's still crooked so
I'm<00:03:11.250> gonna<00:03:11.370> try<00:03:11.489> and<00:03:11.640> pressing<00:03:11.879> against<00:03:12.209> the

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
I'm gonna try and pressing against the

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.140 
I'm gonna try and pressing against the
bottom<00:03:13.549> all<00:03:14.549> right<00:03:14.640> straighten<00:03:14.910> it<00:03:15.030> out<00:03:15.090> a

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
bottom all right straighten it out a

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.440 
bottom all right straighten it out a
little<00:03:15.269> bit<00:03:19.669> we're<00:03:20.669> pretty<00:03:20.880> close<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.150> being

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
little bit we're pretty close to being

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.470 
little bit we're pretty close to being
good<00:03:21.630> here<00:03:21.989> so<00:03:22.169> I'm<00:03:22.290> just<00:03:22.440> going<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:23.389> Center<00:03:24.389> in

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
good here so I'm just going to Center in

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.990 
good here so I'm just going to Center in
the<00:03:24.510> vise<00:03:25.280> and<00:03:26.280> of<00:03:26.370> course<00:03:26.549> it<00:03:26.669> helps<00:03:26.880> them

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
the vise and of course it helps them

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.430 
the vise and of course it helps them
more<00:03:27.150> extender<00:03:27.419> it<00:03:27.510> this<00:03:27.660> way<00:03:27.810> as<00:03:27.959> well<00:03:28.109> that

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
more extender it this way as well that

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.949 
more extender it this way as well that
way<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.709> jaws<00:03:28.980> aren't<00:03:29.340> getting<00:03:29.519> broken<00:03:29.959> I'm

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
way the jaws aren't getting broken I'm

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.990 
way the jaws aren't getting broken I'm
affecting<00:03:31.319> the<00:03:31.410> bearing<00:03:31.739> so<00:03:32.549> try<00:03:32.730> and<00:03:32.849> line<00:03:32.970> it

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
affecting the bearing so try and line it

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:42.690 
affecting the bearing so try and line it
up<00:03:33.150> center<00:03:33.599> of<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.750> vice<00:03:35.389> sure<00:03:36.389> AM<00:03:36.540> L<00:03:36.690> Street

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.809 

it's<00:03:43.629> going<00:03:43.780> to<00:03:43.810> take<00:03:43.900> some<00:03:43.989> time<00:03:44.170> trust<00:03:44.770> me<00:03:44.860> so

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.070 

you<00:03:48.819> know<00:03:48.849> most<00:03:49.180> good<00:03:49.390> metal<00:03:49.660> cores<00:03:49.870> will<00:03:49.989> have

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
you know most good metal cores will have

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.869 
you know most good metal cores will have
a<00:03:50.110> pretty<00:03:50.379> tight<00:03:50.560> bearing<00:03:50.890> race<00:03:51.099> so<00:03:51.700> don't

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 
a pretty tight bearing race so don't

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:54.150 
a pretty tight bearing race so don't
expect<00:03:51.970> it<00:03:52.239> just<00:03:52.390> to<00:03:52.540> go<00:03:53.530> in<00:03:53.680> super<00:03:53.920> easy

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160

muscle into it now i'm gonna try to use

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.550 
muscle into it now i'm gonna try to use
a<00:04:03.700> breaker<00:04:03.940> bar<00:04:04.060> on<00:04:04.420> it<00:04:04.569> trying<00:04:04.900> to<00:04:05.080> get<00:04:05.410> some

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
a breaker bar on it trying to get some

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.160 
a breaker bar on it trying to get some
more<00:04:05.739> on<00:04:09.330> try<00:04:10.330> and<00:04:10.450> get<00:04:10.540> some<00:04:10.690> more<00:04:10.780> leverage

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
more on try and get some more leverage

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:17.020 
more on try and get some more leverage
out<00:04:11.319> of<00:04:11.470> it

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.629 

a<00:04:17.500> little<00:04:18.500> bit<00:04:18.590> more<00:04:18.739> to<00:04:18.859> go<00:04:19.010> you<00:04:19.280> want<00:04:19.430> to<00:04:19.489> have

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
a little bit more to go you want to have

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:27.460 
a little bit more to go you want to have
this<00:04:19.820> bearing<00:04:20.269> flush<00:04:20.980> like<00:04:21.980> you<00:04:22.100> see<00:04:22.310> here

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.679 

you

00:04:30.679 --> 00:04:30.689 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:33.379 

okay<00:04:31.689> so<00:04:31.750> as<00:04:31.990> you<00:04:32.080> see<00:04:32.259> it<00:04:32.379> takes<00:04:32.590> a<00:04:32.740> while<00:04:32.889> but

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
okay so as you see it takes a while but

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.869 
okay so as you see it takes a while but
got<00:04:34.389> to<00:04:34.509> be<00:04:34.569> persistent<00:04:35.080> with<00:04:35.110> it<00:04:35.409> and<00:04:35.879> I'm

00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:36.879 
got to be persistent with it and I'm

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:38.399 
got to be persistent with it and I'm
sure<00:04:37.060> it<00:04:37.180> helps<00:04:37.360> beyond<00:04:37.659> the<00:04:37.750> towels<00:04:37.960> on<00:04:38.199> there

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:38.409 
sure it helps beyond the towels on there

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:41.249 
sure it helps beyond the towels on there
but<00:04:38.620> a<00:04:38.860> little<00:04:39.280> scratch<00:04:39.490> a<00:04:39.580> wheel<00:04:39.840> but<00:04:40.840> best

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
but a little scratch a wheel but best

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:42.420 
but a little scratch a wheel but best
bet<00:04:41.439> was<00:04:41.620> that<00:04:41.650> first<00:04:41.860> thing<00:04:42.099> I<00:04:42.159> showed<00:04:42.370> you

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
bet was that first thing I showed you

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.760 
bet was that first thing I showed you
the<00:04:42.550> arbor<00:04:42.759> press<00:04:43.229> if<00:04:44.229> you<00:04:44.319> don't<00:04:44.469> have<00:04:44.590> one<00:04:44.740> of

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
the arbor press if you don't have one of

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.350 
the arbor press if you don't have one of
those<00:04:44.860> when<00:04:45.039> I<00:04:45.069> guess<00:04:45.280> one<00:04:45.460> of<00:04:45.490> these<00:04:45.699> it'll

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
those when I guess one of these it'll

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.439 
those when I guess one of these it'll
work<00:04:46.770> but<00:04:47.770> uh<00:04:47.800> it<00:04:48.340> might<00:04:48.460> take<00:04:48.669> some<00:04:48.699> time<00:04:48.879> try

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
work but uh it might take some time try

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:51.179 
work but uh it might take some time try
some<00:04:49.599> grease<00:04:49.870> and<00:04:50.289> try<00:04:50.800> a<00:04:50.830> breaker<00:04:51.069> bar

00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:51.189 
some grease and try a breaker bar

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:53.279 
some grease and try a breaker bar
something<00:04:51.789> so<00:04:51.969> you<00:04:52.090> could<00:04:52.300> get<00:04:53.020> some<00:04:53.199> more

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
something so you could get some more

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.740 
something so you could get some more
leverage<00:04:53.620> on<00:04:53.740> this<00:04:53.919> guy<00:04:54.479> that's<00:04:55.479> a<00:04:55.539> first
