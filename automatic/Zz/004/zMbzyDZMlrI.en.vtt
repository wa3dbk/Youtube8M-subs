meeting maybe when I was younger there

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.700 
meeting maybe when I was younger there
was<00:00:06.120> some<00:00:06.270> movie<00:00:06.480> stars<00:00:06.750> and<00:00:07.080> that<00:00:07.379> sort<00:00:07.680> of

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
was some movie stars and that sort of

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.259 
was some movie stars and that sort of
thing<00:00:07.830> but<00:00:07.980> as<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:08.130> get<00:00:08.189> older<00:00:08.400> that<00:00:08.820> really

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
thing but as I get older that really

job quicker and more efficiently one of
the<00:01:43.770> things<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.009> really<00:01:44.430> liked<00:01:44.640> about<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.210> show

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
the things I really liked about the show

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.410 
the things I really liked about the show
was<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.710> never<00:01:46.890> varied<00:01:47.340> its<00:01:47.490> format<00:01:48.119> over

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
was that it never varied its format over

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.539 
was that it never varied its format over
the<00:01:48.600> whole<00:01:48.780> 21<00:01:49.439> seasons<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:51.079> it<00:01:52.079> didn't<00:01:52.680> get<00:01:53.340> in

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
the whole 21 seasons it it didn't get in

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
the twisted camera angles in the zooms

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.219 
the twisted camera angles in the zooms
and<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.310> music<00:01:59.700> playing<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.270> none<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.200> that

course of two days building a
woodworking<00:02:06.689> project<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:07.259> he<00:02:07.350> really<00:02:07.560> did

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
woodworking project and he really did

woodworking project and he really did
those<00:02:07.890> projects<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:08.640> two<00:02:08.849> days

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
those projects in two days

those projects in two days
he<00:02:09.950> would<00:02:10.069> make<00:02:10.189> one<00:02:10.459> prototype<00:02:10.939> of<00:02:11.390> the

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
he would make one prototype of the

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.929 
he would make one prototype of the
project<00:02:12.019> and<00:02:12.200> then<00:02:12.860> come<00:02:13.310> back<00:02:13.340> with<00:02:13.819> the

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:13.939 
project and then come back with the

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:15.670 
project and then come back with the
cameras<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.450> spend<00:02:14.870> two<00:02:15.049> days<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.530> build

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
cameras and spend two days to build

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.110 
cameras and spend two days to build
those<00:02:15.890> things<00:02:15.920> which<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.250> me<00:02:16.489> is<00:02:16.579> amazing<00:02:16.819> is

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
those things which to me is amazing is

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.309 
those things which to me is amazing is
if<00:02:17.180> we<00:02:17.239> take<00:02:17.390> me<00:02:17.540> you<00:02:17.720> know<00:02:17.810> months<00:02:18.140> of

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
if we take me you know months of

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.649 
if we take me you know months of
weekends<00:02:18.799> to<00:02:19.069> work<00:02:19.760> on<00:02:19.939> some<00:02:20.450> of<00:02:20.540> those

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:20.659 
weekends to work on some of those

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:24.069 
weekends to work on some of those
projects<00:02:21.319> and<00:02:21.560> I<00:02:22.430> think<00:02:23.209> that<00:02:23.360> is<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.629> essence

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.079 
projects and I think that is the essence

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.509 
projects and I think that is the essence
of<00:02:24.200> woodworking<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:25.010> I<00:02:25.040> think<00:02:25.250> that's<00:02:25.370> why<00:02:25.489> a

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
of woodworking and I think that's why a

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.910 
of woodworking and I think that's why a
lot<00:02:25.640> of<00:02:25.849> woodworkers<00:02:26.420> really<00:02:27.079> responded<00:02:27.709> so

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
lot of woodworkers really responded so

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.069 
lot of woodworkers really responded so
well<00:02:28.069> that<00:02:28.400> show<00:02:28.700> is<00:02:29.060> because<00:02:29.510> it<00:02:29.629> was<00:02:29.750> kind<00:02:29.989> of

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
well that show is because it was kind of

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:32.530 
well that show is because it was kind of

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
course measure twice cut once which was

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.699 
course measure twice cut once which was
a<00:03:04.069> really<00:03:04.280> good<00:03:04.489> thing<00:03:05.239> to<00:03:05.870> remember<00:03:06.379> always

a really good thing to remember always

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.729 
a really good thing to remember always
in<00:03:07.099> woodworking<00:03:08.000> and<00:03:08.209> but<00:03:08.959> one<00:03:09.139> thing<00:03:09.290> he<00:03:09.470> did

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
in woodworking and but one thing he did

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.720 
in woodworking and but one thing he did
he<00:03:11.109> expressed<00:03:12.109> a<00:03:12.230> number<00:03:12.530> of<00:03:12.650> times<00:03:12.920> is<00:03:13.190> don't

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
he expressed a number of times is don't

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.520 
he expressed a number of times is don't
even<00:03:13.940> measure<00:03:14.150> it<00:03:14.389> all<00:03:14.540> if<00:03:14.750> you<00:03:14.840> don't<00:03:15.019> have<00:03:15.260> to

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
even measure it all if you don't have to

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.289 
even measure it all if you don't have to
if<00:03:15.650> you<00:03:15.739> can<00:03:15.889> make<00:03:16.010> a<00:03:16.040> jig<00:03:16.459> that<00:03:16.489> is<00:03:16.849> is<00:03:17.060> the

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
if you can make a jig that is is the

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:18.789 
if you can make a jig that is is the
right<00:03:17.480> length<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:18.049> you<00:03:18.109> can<00:03:18.260> use<00:03:18.440> that<00:03:18.590> to

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
right length and you can use that to

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.650 
right length and you can use that to
make<00:03:18.949> repeated<00:03:19.250> cuts<00:03:19.669> do<00:03:19.970> it<00:03:20.150> you<00:03:20.299> know<00:03:20.419> tape

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
make repeated cuts do it you know tape

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.240 
make repeated cuts do it you know tape
measure<00:03:20.870> is<00:03:21.049> never<00:03:21.260> really<00:03:21.470> that<00:03:21.560> accurate

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
measure is never really that accurate

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.759 
measure is never really that accurate
over<00:03:22.489> repeated<00:03:23.120> times<00:03:23.419> and<00:03:23.750> so<00:03:24.379> I<00:03:24.440> took<00:03:24.620> that

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
over repeated times and so I took that

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.210 
over repeated times and so I took that
to<00:03:24.980> heart<00:03:25.160> so<00:03:26.060> anyway<00:03:26.359> there's<00:03:26.810> a<00:03:26.870> lot<00:03:26.959> I<00:03:27.220> would

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:12.789 
take a lot of the techniques that Hughes
and<00:04:11.629> apply<00:04:11.959> them<00:04:12.139> to<00:04:12.260> my<00:04:12.349> own<00:04:12.379> work

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
and apply them to my own work

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
don't know who's going to fill that void

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.610 
don't know who's going to fill that void
I<00:04:42.580> actually<00:04:43.449> I<00:04:43.660> don't<00:04:43.720> think<00:04:43.870> anybody<00:04:44.380> will

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
I actually I don't think anybody will

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.930 
I actually I don't think anybody will
because<00:04:45.010> I<00:04:45.130> don't<00:04:45.430> think<00:04:45.490> they're<00:04:45.729> going<00:04:45.850> to

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
because I don't think they're going to

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.750 
because I don't think they're going to
be<00:04:46.290> producing<00:04:47.290> another<00:04:47.530> show<00:04:47.800> like<00:04:48.070> that

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
be producing another show like that

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.969 
be producing another show like that
I<00:04:48.840> suppose<00:04:49.840> the<00:04:50.020> internet<00:04:50.380> will<00:04:50.530> have<00:04:50.680> to<00:04:50.800> fill

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
I suppose the internet will have to fill

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.250 
I suppose the internet will have to fill
that<00:04:51.130> void<00:04:51.460> with<00:04:51.790> people<00:04:52.180> like<00:04:52.570> me<00:04:52.810> making

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
that void with people like me making

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.960 
that void with people like me making
videos<00:04:53.590> although<00:04:54.010> you<00:04:54.669> know<00:04:54.760> they're<00:04:54.880> not

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
videos although you know they're not

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.730 
videos although you know they're not
going<00:04:55.090> to<00:04:55.150> be<00:04:55.240> anywhere<00:04:55.479> near<00:04:55.780> that<00:04:55.840> level<00:04:56.350> of

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
going to be anywhere near that level of

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.090 
going to be anywhere near that level of
skill<00:04:57.190> and<00:04:57.250> craftsmanship<00:04:58.120> but<00:04:58.750> you<00:04:59.260> probably

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
skill and craftsmanship but you probably

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.830
