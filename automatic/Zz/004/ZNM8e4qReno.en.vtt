what<00:01:47.150> we<00:01:47.270> suggest<00:01:47.480> to<00:01:47.870> use<00:01:47.900> the<00:01:48.230> off<00:01:48.410> arm<00:01:48.740> for

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.700 
what we suggest to use the off arm for
is<00:01:49.280> an<00:01:49.880> arm<00:01:50.180> bar<00:01:50.420> where<00:01:50.780> we<00:01:50.930> can<00:01:51.140> repel<00:01:51.500> the

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
is an arm bar where we can repel the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.130 
is an arm bar where we can repel the
defense<00:01:52.130> an<00:01:52.390> analogy<00:01:53.390> here<00:01:53.630> would<00:01:53.810> be<00:01:53.960> like

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
defense an analogy here would be like

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
dribble hand is really important because

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.210 
dribble hand is really important because
this<00:02:41.900> is<00:02:42.020> how<00:02:42.140> we're<00:02:42.320> going<00:02:42.470> to<00:02:42.530> contact<00:02:43.040> or

this is how we're going to contact or

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.700 
this is how we're going to contact or
touch<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.580> basketball<00:02:44.200> what<00:02:45.200> we<00:02:45.290> want<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.560> do

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.410 
utilize the finger pads and not the palm
this<00:02:51.620> gives<00:02:51.920> us<00:02:52.100> a<00:02:52.220> better<00:02:52.370> control<00:02:52.940> of<00:02:53.209> the

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
this gives us a better control of the

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.040 
this gives us a better control of the
basketball<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:55.700> next<00:02:55.940> part<00:02:56.180> of<00:02:56.300> dribbling<00:02:56.840> is

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
basketball the next part of dribbling is

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.110 
basketball the next part of dribbling is
what<00:02:57.230> we<00:02:57.320> call<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.620> dribble<00:02:57.950> motion<00:02:58.310> it's

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
what we call the dribble motion it's

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.000 
what we call the dribble motion it's
going<00:02:59.300> to<00:02:59.360> be<00:02:59.450> important<00:03:00.020> to<00:03:00.110> understand<00:03:00.920> that

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
going to be important to understand that

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.890 
going to be important to understand that
you<00:03:01.130> must<00:03:01.370> drive<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.730> ball<00:03:02.060> into<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.600> floor

of minutes in this dribble motion there

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.729 
of minutes in this dribble motion there
are<00:03:08.180> two<00:03:08.330> things<00:03:08.600> that<00:03:08.780> are<00:03:08.810> really<00:03:09.170> important

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
are two things that are really important

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.100 
are two things that are really important
for<00:03:09.800> us<00:03:10.010> to<00:03:10.100> remember<00:03:10.700> number<00:03:11.450> one<00:03:11.480> we<00:03:11.810> want<00:03:12.020> to

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
for us to remember number one we want to

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.860 
for us to remember number one we want to
have<00:03:12.230> an<00:03:12.410> elbow<00:03:12.860> pop<00:03:13.190> which<00:03:13.910> is<00:03:14.090> a<00:03:14.120> powerful

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
have an elbow pop which is a powerful

extension of the elbow joint and

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.810 
extension of the elbow joint and
secondly<00:03:17.720> we<00:03:18.019> have<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:18.320> wrist<00:03:18.590> snap<00:03:18.860> which<00:03:19.580> is

secondly we have the wrist snap which is

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.660 
secondly we have the wrist snap which is
a<00:03:19.850> flexing<00:03:20.570> motion<00:03:20.930> which<00:03:21.080> imparts<00:03:21.670> control

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
a flexing motion which imparts control

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.320 
a flexing motion which imparts control
on<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.510> ball<00:03:24.040> make<00:03:25.040> sure<00:03:25.220> that<00:03:25.489> we<00:03:25.700> pound<00:03:26.090> the

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
on the ball make sure that we pound the

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.720 
on the ball make sure that we pound the
ball<00:03:26.480> into<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.959> floor<00:03:27.380> we<00:03:28.130> want<00:03:28.400> the<00:03:28.519> ball<00:03:28.700> to

three<00:05:33.800> times<00:05:34.150> so<00:05:35.150> in<00:05:35.360> the<00:05:35.449> course<00:05:35.750> of<00:05:35.960> a<00:05:36.080> very

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
three times so in the course of a very

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.129 
three times so in the course of a very
short<00:05:36.560> period<00:05:36.889> you<00:05:37.580> would<00:05:37.760> end<00:05:37.970> up<00:05:38.120> with<00:05:38.180> 300

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
short period you would end up with 300

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:43.029 
short period you would end up with 300
