because<00:01:48.590> my<00:01:49.590> hair<00:01:49.770> needs<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.670> once<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.390> have

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
because my hair needs it and once I have

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.840 
because my hair needs it and once I have
the<00:01:52.200> right<00:01:52.380> amount<00:01:52.409> I'm<00:01:52.860> just<00:01:53.040> going<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.250> start

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
the right amount I'm just going to start

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.600 
the right amount I'm just going to start
twisting<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.990> you're<00:01:55.920> gonna<00:01:56.009> see<00:01:56.280> like<00:01:56.430> this

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
twisting and you're gonna see like this

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.240 
twisting and you're gonna see like this
white<00:01:56.969> residue<00:01:57.570> probably<00:01:58.200> like<00:01:58.350> what<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.040> that

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
white residue probably like what is that

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.749 
white residue probably like what is that
but<00:01:59.840> it<00:02:00.840> dries<00:02:01.530> up<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.280> just<00:02:02.490> feel<00:02:02.610> like

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
but it dries up and I just feel like

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.580
