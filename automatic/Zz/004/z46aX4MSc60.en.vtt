let's<00:02:05.670> try<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:05.969> find<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.299> weak<00:02:06.450> spot<00:02:06.479> in<00:02:06.869> here<00:02:07.110> to

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
let's try to find a weak spot in here to

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.820 
let's try to find a weak spot in here to
make<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.560> easier

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.309 

and<00:02:13.830> then<00:02:14.220> you're<00:02:14.370> just<00:02:14.459> gonna<00:02:14.989> slowly<00:02:15.989> break

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
and then you're just gonna slowly break

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:22.610 
and then you're just gonna slowly break
away<00:02:17.989> the<00:02:18.989> eggshell<00:02:20.390> working<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.660> like<00:02:22.349> to<00:02:22.470> work

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
away the eggshell working I like to work

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.050 
away the eggshell working I like to work
on<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:22.890> edge<00:02:23.099> of<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.430> hole<00:02:23.580> that's<00:02:23.760> already

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
on the edge of the hole that's already

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.809 
on the edge of the hole that's already
been<00:02:24.269> made<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.750> just<00:02:25.260> keep<00:02:26.090> collapsing<00:02:27.090> it<00:02:27.209> in

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
been made and just keep collapsing it in

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.430 
been made and just keep collapsing it in
and<00:02:29.819> you're<00:02:30.540> gonna<00:02:30.630> be<00:02:30.810> making<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:31.200> pretty

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
and you're gonna be making a pretty

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.320 
and you're gonna be making a pretty
sizable<00:02:32.010> hole<00:02:33.590> and<00:02:34.819> this<00:02:35.819> is<00:02:35.970> probably<00:02:36.239> the

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
sizable hole and this is probably the

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.330 
sizable hole and this is probably the
messiest<00:02:36.690> part<00:02:36.959> because<00:02:37.650> there's<00:02:37.860> little

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
messiest part because there's little

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.110 
messiest part because there's little
bits<00:02:38.610> of<00:02:38.700> eggshell<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.769> and<00:02:40.769> of<00:02:41.640> course<00:02:41.670> yolk

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
bits of eggshell and and of course yolk

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.199 
bits of eggshell and and of course yolk
is<00:02:42.299> gonna<00:02:42.480> be<00:02:42.599> running<00:02:42.870> out<00:02:43.880> and<00:02:44.880> you<00:02:45.180> just

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
is gonna be running out and you just

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.309 
is gonna be running out and you just
want<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:45.510> carefully<00:02:46.910> make<00:02:47.910> make<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.840> hole<00:02:49.049> and

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
want to carefully make make the hole and

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.440 
want to carefully make make the hole and
make<00:02:50.160> sure<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.459> membrane<00:02:50.790> is<00:02:50.880> all<00:02:51.000> broken<00:02:51.329> up

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
make sure the membrane is all broken up

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.539 
make sure the membrane is all broken up
and<00:02:52.489> then<00:02:54.049> try<00:02:55.049> to<00:02:55.079> get<00:02:55.380> as<00:02:55.560> much<00:02:56.010> as<00:02:56.069> you<00:02:56.340> as

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
and then try to get as much as you as

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.110 
and then try to get as much as you as
you<00:02:56.790> can<00:02:57.000> out<00:02:57.209> of<00:02:57.390> here<00:02:57.599> and<00:02:57.920> then<00:02:58.920> of<00:02:59.040> course

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
you can out of here and then of course

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.020 
you can out of here and then of course
as<00:03:00.120> always<00:03:00.750> with<00:03:01.110> raw<00:03:01.319> egg<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.860> want<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.160> you

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
as always with raw egg you want to you

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.920 
as always with raw egg you want to you
want<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.269> observe<00:03:03.360> proper<00:03:03.989> food<00:03:04.680> safety<00:03:05.930> so

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
want to observe proper food safety so

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.509 
want to observe proper food safety so
you<00:03:06.989> want<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.319> make<00:03:07.440> sure<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:07.860> after<00:03:08.069> this<00:03:08.400> is

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
you want to make sure that after this is

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:09.890 
you want to make sure that after this is
all<00:03:08.640> finished<00:03:08.849> you<00:03:09.209> wash<00:03:09.420> your<00:03:09.569> hands<00:03:09.780> very

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
all finished you wash your hands very

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.770 
all finished you wash your hands very
well<00:03:10.170> with<00:03:10.590> soap<00:03:10.799> and<00:03:11.010> hot<00:03:11.040> water<00:03:11.630> because<00:03:12.630> of

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
well with soap and hot water because of

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.360 
well with soap and hot water because of
all<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.019> bacteria<00:03:13.470> that<00:03:13.620> can<00:03:13.829> be<00:03:13.860> contained

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
all the bacteria that can be contained

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.240 
all the bacteria that can be contained
and<00:03:14.579> raw<00:03:14.700> egg<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.410> you<00:03:16.410> also<00:03:16.650> want<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.010> rinse

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
and raw egg and you also want to rinse

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.690 
and raw egg and you also want to rinse
out<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.639> egg<00:03:18.139> and<00:03:19.250> and<00:03:20.250> let<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.519> dry<00:03:20.670> overnight

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
out the egg and and let it dry overnight

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.559 
out the egg and and let it dry overnight
to<00:03:21.660> make<00:03:21.780> sure<00:03:21.959> that<00:03:22.170> all<00:03:22.350> of<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:23.730> white

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
to make sure that all of the the white

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.660 
to make sure that all of the the white
and<00:03:24.870> egg<00:03:25.109> yolk<00:03:25.350> is<00:03:25.530> officially<00:03:26.250> out<00:03:26.370> of<00:03:26.400> there

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
and egg yolk is officially out of there

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:34.160 
and egg yolk is officially out of there
and<00:03:27.920> then<00:03:28.920> after<00:03:29.910> its<00:03:30.030> dried<00:03:33.079> you're<00:03:34.079> gonna

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
and then after its dried you're gonna

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.699 
and then after its dried you're gonna
have<00:03:34.440> a<00:03:34.470> nice<00:03:34.769> little<00:03:36.019> nice<00:03:37.019> little<00:03:37.049> hole<00:03:37.440> and

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
have a nice little nice little hole and

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.580 
have a nice little nice little hole and
in<00:03:38.280> a<00:03:38.370> clean<00:03:38.639> eggshell<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.299> you<00:03:40.109> can<00:03:40.260> continue

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
in a clean eggshell and you can continue

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.120 
in a clean eggshell and you can continue
breaking<00:03:41.100> up<00:03:41.329> the<00:03:42.329> little<00:03:42.540> pieces<00:03:42.810> of<00:03:43.019> the<00:03:43.319> egg

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
breaking up the little pieces of the egg

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.580 
breaking up the little pieces of the egg
but<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:45.090> wouldn't<00:03:45.329> recommend<00:03:45.569> going<00:03:45.780> too<00:03:46.290> crazy

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
but I wouldn't recommend going too crazy

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.840 
but I wouldn't recommend going too crazy
because<00:03:46.769> these<00:03:47.010> holes<00:03:47.280> can<00:03:47.459> get<00:03:47.579> very<00:03:47.760> large

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
because these holes can get very large

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:53.330 
because these holes can get very large
very<00:03:48.480> quickly<00:03:49.430> so<00:03:50.430> then<00:03:50.609> you<00:03:51.450> start<00:03:52.340> by

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
very quickly so then you start by

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.830 
very quickly so then you start by
finishing<00:03:53.609> off<00:03:54.049> the<00:03:55.049> edge<00:03:55.170> of<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:55.530> eggshell

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
finishing off the edge of the eggshell

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.900 
finishing off the edge of the eggshell
by<00:03:57.840> just<00:03:58.079> using<00:03:58.290> a<00:03:58.530> little<00:03:58.560> bit<00:03:58.980> of<00:03:59.069> glue<00:03:59.310> any

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
by just using a little bit of glue any

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.259 
by just using a little bit of glue any
white<00:04:00.299> glue<00:04:00.569> will<00:04:00.959> probably<00:04:01.349> do<00:04:02.030> you<00:04:03.030> want<00:04:03.180> to

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
white glue will probably do you want to

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.400 
white glue will probably do you want to
use<00:04:03.359> a<00:04:03.389> somewhat<00:04:04.230> strong<00:04:04.620> glue<00:04:06.109> or<00:04:07.109> you<00:04:07.139> can

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
use a somewhat strong glue or you can

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.349 
use a somewhat strong glue or you can
also<00:04:07.530> use<00:04:07.859> hot<00:04:08.099> glue<00:04:08.209> which<00:04:09.209> I<00:04:09.299> don't

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
also use hot glue which I don't

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.390 
also use hot glue which I don't
recommend<00:04:09.540> if<00:04:10.319> you're<00:04:10.500> using<00:04:10.919> it<00:04:11.130> around

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
recommend if you're using it around

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.120 
recommend if you're using it around
children<00:04:12.290> because<00:04:13.290> things<00:04:13.500> can<00:04:13.680> get<00:04:13.799> a<00:04:14.040> little

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
children because things can get a little

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.529 
children because things can get a little
bit<00:04:15.079> just<00:04:16.079> a<00:04:16.169> little<00:04:16.229> bit<00:04:16.410> crazy<00:04:16.880> so<00:04:17.880> you're

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
bit just a little bit crazy so you're

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.990 
bit just a little bit crazy so you're
just<00:04:18.660> going<00:04:18.840> to<00:04:18.900> take<00:04:19.169> your<00:04:19.549> your<00:04:20.549> ribbon<00:04:20.909> or

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
just going to take your your ribbon or

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.250 
just going to take your your ribbon or
trim<00:04:21.299> and<00:04:21.830> just<00:04:22.830> lay<00:04:23.190> it<00:04:23.250> on<00:04:23.400> there

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
trim and just lay it on there

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.900 
trim and just lay it on there
and<00:04:25.540> then<00:04:26.540> slowly<00:04:26.870> curve<00:04:27.260> it<00:04:27.380> around<00:04:27.910> making

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
and then slowly curve it around making

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.580 
and then slowly curve it around making
sure<00:04:29.060> that<00:04:29.300> there's<00:04:29.480> good<00:04:29.540> adhesion<00:04:30.230> with<00:04:30.440> all

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
sure that there's good adhesion with all

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.690 
sure that there's good adhesion with all
the<00:04:30.740> glue<00:04:31.810> and<00:04:32.950> most<00:04:33.950> of<00:04:34.070> these<00:04:34.160> chords<00:04:34.520> are

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
the glue and most of these chords are

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.300 
the glue and most of these chords are
chords<00:04:35.570> or<00:04:35.690> ribbons<00:04:35.990> that<00:04:36.560> you<00:04:36.680> can<00:04:36.860> find<00:04:37.130> in

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
chords or ribbons that you can find in

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.520 
chords or ribbons that you can find in
craft<00:04:37.550> stores<00:04:37.670> are<00:04:38.000> meant<00:04:38.300> to<00:04:38.390> curve<00:04:38.990> around<00:04:39.140> a

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
craft stores are meant to curve around a

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.650 
craft stores are meant to curve around a
a<00:04:40.520> a<00:04:41.380> hole<00:04:42.380> or<00:04:42.740> like<00:04:43.550> a<00:04:43.580> round<00:04:43.940> object<00:04:44.210> like

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
a a hole or like a round object like

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.050 
a a hole or like a round object like
this<00:04:44.870> so<00:04:45.800> it'll<00:04:45.920> be<00:04:46.040> pretty<00:04:46.160> easy<00:04:46.510> to<00:04:47.510> to<00:04:48.200> just

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
this so it'll be pretty easy to to just

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.350 
this so it'll be pretty easy to to just
bend<00:04:50.060> it<00:04:50.270> around<00:04:50.390> the<00:04:51.260> hole<00:04:51.440> and<00:04:52.180> then<00:04:53.180> you

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
bend it around the hole and then you

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.130 
bend it around the hole and then you
just<00:04:53.540> want<00:04:53.780> to<00:04:55.300> take<00:04:56.300> it<00:04:56.480> and<00:04:56.600> clip<00:04:56.840> it<00:04:56.960> on<00:04:57.050> the

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
just want to take it and clip it on the

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:02.980 
just want to take it and clip it on the
end<00:05:00.130> and<00:05:01.150> then<00:05:02.150> probably<00:05:02.360> put<00:05:02.630> a<00:05:02.660> little<00:05:02.750> bit

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
end and then probably put a little bit

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.670 
end and then probably put a little bit
more<00:05:03.230> glue<00:05:04.870> luckily<00:05:05.870> this<00:05:05.990> stuff<00:05:06.200> dries<00:05:06.380> clear

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
more glue luckily this stuff dries clear

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.870 
more glue luckily this stuff dries clear
so<00:05:06.800> you<00:05:07.040> don't<00:05:07.250> have<00:05:07.310> to<00:05:07.430> worry<00:05:07.550> about<00:05:07.700> putting

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
so you don't have to worry about putting

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.360 
so you don't have to worry about putting
too<00:05:08.120> much<00:05:08.470> because<00:05:09.470> you<00:05:09.650> probably<00:05:10.160> won't<00:05:10.280> be

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
too much because you probably won't be

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.070 
too much because you probably won't be
able<00:05:10.430> to<00:05:10.580> see<00:05:10.730> it<00:05:10.820> once<00:05:11.030> it's<00:05:11.240> dried<00:05:12.670> and<00:05:14.080> then

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
able to see it once it's dried and then

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.560 
able to see it once it's dried and then
just<00:05:15.800> keep<00:05:15.950> pressing<00:05:16.250> it<00:05:16.430> in<00:05:16.550> until<00:05:17.360> it's

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
just keep pressing it in until it's

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.890 
just keep pressing it in until it's
until<00:05:18.200> it's<00:05:18.380> a<00:05:18.560> set<00:05:19.130> basically<00:05:19.670> and<00:05:20.030> then

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
until it's a set basically and then

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.260 
until it's a set basically and then
you're<00:05:21.050> gonna<00:05:21.170> have<00:05:21.470> this<00:05:21.950> little<00:05:22.280> this

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
you're gonna have this little this

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.150 
you're gonna have this little this
little<00:05:23.330> frame<00:05:23.780> to<00:05:23.960> work<00:05:23.990> with<00:05:24.290> and<00:05:24.620> then<00:05:25.130> you

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
little frame to work with and then you

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.480 
little frame to work with and then you
can<00:05:25.430> put<00:05:25.670> different<00:05:27.310> different<00:05:28.310> things

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
can put different different things

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:29.710 
can put different different things
inside<00:05:28.820> of<00:05:28.880> it

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
I'm just putting some glue in there to

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.810 
I'm just putting some glue in there to
set<00:05:52.610> my<00:05:52.760> my<00:05:53.120> tissue<00:05:54.190> you<00:05:55.190> basically<00:05:55.520> want<00:05:55.730> to

hanging ornament because if it's too

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.480 
hanging ornament because if it's too
heavy<00:06:02.930> it'll<00:06:03.380> put<00:06:03.560> too<00:06:03.710> much<00:06:03.830> strain<00:06:04.160> on<00:06:04.340> the

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
heavy it'll put too much strain on the

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.540 
heavy it'll put too much strain on the
on<00:06:04.940> the<00:06:05.180> egg<00:06:05.330> shell<00:06:06.220> so<00:06:07.220> you<00:06:07.280> just<00:06:07.370> want<00:06:07.520> to

on the egg shell so you just want to

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.950 
on the egg shell so you just want to
keep<00:06:07.730> it<00:06:07.850> light<00:06:08.200> and<00:06:10.420> use<00:06:11.420> a<00:06:11.450> paintbrush<00:06:11.840> to

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
keep it light and use a paintbrush to

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:18.430 
keep it light and use a paintbrush to
move<00:06:12.320> the<00:06:13.060> the<00:06:14.060> the<00:06:14.600> glue<00:06:15.170> around<00:06:17.020> and<00:06:18.020> set

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
move the the the glue around and set

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.380 
move the the the glue around and set
your<00:06:19.630> tissue<00:06:20.630> or<00:06:20.870> polyfilled<00:06:21.320> in<00:06:21.440> there<00:06:21.620> and
