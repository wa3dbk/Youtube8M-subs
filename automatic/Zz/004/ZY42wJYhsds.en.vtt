00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:52.670
 Well if you look at this here, I live population is Ibyeong Hong 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:58.870
 Something like a model 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:01.030
 That's what I think I've made a Korean actor's disease model 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.730
 Hmm 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.570

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.760

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:29.320
 korres It is not the continuation of the loft planet's posthumous work but 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.820
 Or rather the next work 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.700
