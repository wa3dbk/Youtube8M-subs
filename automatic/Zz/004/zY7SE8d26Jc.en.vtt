00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.750
 Y 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.800
 hello good morning good afternoon good 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.630
 nights depending on the area they are 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.910
 watching this video, Juan Carlos speaks to them 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.580
 jimÃ©nez and continuing with this course 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.029
 about jim in this tutorial in this 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.130
 chapter we will see the following 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.190
 selection tools which is the 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.900
 magic wand and the magnetic tie the 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.760
 first of all let's go then with 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.460
 the magnetic loop this tool what 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.930
 what you are going to do is join anchor points and 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.820
 depending on it, you can start 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.040
 select for example I can do it 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.690
 freehand and for example 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.989
 selecting here the outline of the 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.399
 clear car that here would have 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.750
 to support me maybe with a tablet 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.400
 graph since my pulse is not so 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.990
 good 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.820
 with the mouse 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.130
 or you can do it simply and simply 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.800
 letting go and clicking on the places 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:04.640
 where I consider that for example they are 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.640
 important let's say yes 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.210
 and well let's put it to vacuum for 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.740
 that this not simply and simply she 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.300
 reaching the point of origin 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.140
 close and I can start to select 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:19.330
 something else with this raised hand is 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.880
 important to clarify that these worlds 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.980
 modes that the selection has the loop 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.600
 magnetic, well, this is 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.170
 specifically for example in terms of 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.270
 the vertices is is considering doing 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.800
 polygonal images while the one that 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.510
 is freehand let's say it's basically 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.060
 to the touch although it is generating, let's say 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.350
 vertex points all the time by 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.700
 example when we already have something 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.700
 selected we can 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.450
 they simply started again to a 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.700
 new selection selection in what 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.890
 previous but we can go again here 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.190
 in the drop-down bar where 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.810
 we have here where it says selection 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.050
 and we're going to see that we have the options 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.200
 to select all not select 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.700
 none or invert selection yes that is 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.800
 I can give you not select anything and 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.660
 the selection is automatically deleted 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.610
 the next tool that we are going to 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.540
 find is the magic wand this 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.340
 tool what is going to be 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:16.890
 specifically it is to select the zones 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.110
 that by its color nature let's say 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.600
 or pixels that match what the 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.520
 pixel with the color of the pixel that 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.560
 let's select for example us 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.800
 we can select this the chest of 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.840
 this car if we click on it we see 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.310
 that selects me all this and stops 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.380
 here in the area because because he found 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.330
 that there was a change of color this 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.060
 we will be able to modify or control 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.860
 with respect to or conforming to the threshold is 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.320
 say the color tolerance we 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.490
 we can modify for example I give 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.490
 a little more tolerance 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.620
 and I click again on the chest and 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.540
 we see every month election no more because 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.549
 by I commented the threshold if I again 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.549
 modified it a little more 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.840
 and again click we see that now I 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.060
 he selected a lot because because the 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.100
 threshold rise is greatly increased 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.280
 so here what to do in 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.080
 this case is to decrease let's say the threshold 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.350
 that we had not because if as we saw already 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.580
 he selected us greatly because 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.470
 threshold was too high 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.630
 let's see again click even that 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.970
 still this let's say these colors so 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.410
 above consider that it considers according to 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.000
 threshold or what I put threshold 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.260
 well, they are inside the 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.459
 tonality close to those and 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.440
 selecting for seats you have to 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.850
 have to be in let's say measuring 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.560
 with a lot of pressure here we can 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.020
 modify the threshold in this way 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.480
 directly if not us if it is not reached 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.640
 to appreciate let's put it here and of 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.310
 this way we can this modify the 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.330
 let's say more precisely 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.350
 we just click again and 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.420
 already in this way we have it ok 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.160
 it is important to see that in this 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.600
 tool as well as in all those 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.400
 of selection we have the possibility of 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.710
 add selection subtract selection e 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.360
 intersection ar for it for example in 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.570
 this case I can handle this threshold 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.700
 low and just keep let's say to 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.090
 use the add selection and give 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.860
 click 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.870
 for example in this other area and this 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.820
 way the second thing is added with the first 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.980
 and in this way let's say without having to 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.630
 increase so much the selection can go 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.130
 adding up areas and in this way I can 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.050
 select for example nothing else what 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.120
 is the chest on top of the 

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.110
 automobile ok 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.370
 these two are the two tools 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:27.720
 let's say specialized you have for 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.700
 make selections we see that also like this 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.100
 as in how in photoshop we have this 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.160
 option ie they are interchangeable the 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.350
 of the sum of intersection subtraction and good 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.840
 here we can also see that we can 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.450
 select not only for this by the 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.340
 color or by the hue of the color and 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.540
 let's say modifying what is the threshold 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.580
 We can also select by 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.520
 compound as we see here by colors 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.650
 let's say they are relief by tone by 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.790
 saturation even by the value ok that 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.500
 we 'll see, let's say in more detail 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.480
 after but good, these are 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.850
 two special selection tools 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.890
 that we are going to find in gimp and that in 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.810
 that sense are very similar to what 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.730
 would be for example in photoshop of 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.100
 moment would be all about this 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:11.070
 chapter this tutorial I invite you to 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.020
 keep watching this course about games and 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.060
 well, I also invite you to 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.040
 subscribe to follow us to the different 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.150
 social networks and that is also well 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.680
 Good to see us the other courses 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.360
 that we are uploading about photoshop 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.540
 so good in this way you can see 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.970
 confronting the tools that 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:32.400
 we have and well also excel if 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:35.630
 they are interested now I write endlessly it is not 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.630
 good until next time
