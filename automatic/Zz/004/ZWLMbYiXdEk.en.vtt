00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 now where to give the fees 

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:12.839
 the president ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:17.769
 German Bundeswehr soldiers but nothing but nothing in the Middle East 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.859
 search 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:24.210
 My colleague Wolfgang Gerke has already made this very clear in the last week 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.060
 made 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.000
 formally it circulate today over the extension of the employment German 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.160
 Soldiers in front of Lebanon 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.310
 the fact is 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.970
 is much more on the agenda 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.070
 It is no longer about "me cheaper than the role of the Bundeswehr in the 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.220
 German foreign policy 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.300
 the debate between them not so from the SPD in the Ministry of Defense all 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.300
 Samples mountain in the last week 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.930
 was there very informative well we are all glad that 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.749
 He discovered responsibility for being taken over 

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:00.749
 the rounds took responsibility 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.920
 a presence of the last week was very revealing of the 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.320
 Federal Returning Officer 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.920
 with the matter of course of foreign assignments without time pressure samples 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.870
 to go 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:13.610
 and he does not 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.350
 Saleh explained the unifil mission clearly 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.410
 especially the 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.210
 for other missions in the future 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.600
 they all know 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.070
 the left for the Bundeswehr as an army in global use never as 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.070
 To take for granted 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.290
 the left is the only party that is consistent against foreign missions 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.420
 Anklam LAN with her does not claim that foreign missions for his party never 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.530
 Normality would be then one wonders already where he in the last eleven 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.610
 Was years 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.280
 after all, the SPD has 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.640
 but responsible for it 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.810
 That foreign missions of the Bundeswehr could become a normality 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.310
 but now to unifil mandate 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.220
 Germany is unspeakably a crime against the Jews and 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.709
 Responsible for the Jews 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.109
 Germany can 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:15.779
 never appear as a neutral player in the Middle East region 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.270
 almost would be for example 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.300
 if German ships an Israeli aircraft or ship for violation 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.730
 against Brender Solution 17 01 involved in a battle 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.879
 or is it comes to sacrifices 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.019
 the referee Horst Klein who in relation to such an incident 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.589
 a small thing 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:43.939
 this is not a clear case 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:48.109
 In the last three years there has been more confrontation between Germans 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:49.759
 and Israeli army 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:53.779
 Nobody can guarantee the comparable incidents in the 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:56.369
 Future will be smooth 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:59.429
 German responsibility in this region can not and must not 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.379
 articulate militarily 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:12.449
 as remember the summer of 2009, the war was raging between 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:16.839
 Israeli forces and is full of units and what weapons came 

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:18.160
 used here 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.980
 German weapons on both sides of the front that must never again 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.529
 occurrence 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:28.599
 Gun shipments to Lebanon allegedly do not control the EU much 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.139
 and at the same time, monkeys still count 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:36.849
 shipped from Germany to Israel and other countries in the region 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.629
 Arms shipments in crisis areas should be avoided in principle 

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:50.829
 let me emphasize again in the end is must not be 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:55.680
 that with the deployment of German soldiers in the Middle East a de - taboo of the 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.680
 Bundeswehr deployment takes place all over the world 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.059
 a comprehensive political process 

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:06.159
 There will be no lasting peace and security in the Middle East 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:11.680
 neither for the people in Israel nor in Lebanon nor in other states of the 

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:12.909
 region 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.780
 Germans should not complicate this process with more unarmed weapons 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:19.269
 Many Thanks
