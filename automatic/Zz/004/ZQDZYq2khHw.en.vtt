then let's go get a nice little
transition<00:01:49.290> it's<00:01:50.250> kind<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.490> like<00:01:50.960> Windows

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
transition it's kind of like Windows

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.319 
transition it's kind of like Windows
Movie<00:01:52.079> Maker<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.530> guess<00:01:52.909> it's<00:01:53.909> not<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.149> best

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
Movie Maker I guess it's not the best

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.359 
Movie Maker I guess it's not the best
but<00:01:54.570> it's<00:01:54.899> certainly<00:01:55.049> sent<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.500> use<00:01:55.680> if<00:01:55.920> you

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
instantly on here but I don't actually

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.260 
instantly on here but I don't actually
believe<00:02:41.650> it<00:02:41.860> is<00:02:41.980> I've<00:02:42.490> tried<00:02:42.760> looking<00:02:43.000> at<00:02:43.120> both

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
believe it is I've tried looking at both

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.900 
believe it is I've tried looking at both
my<00:02:43.540> xbox<00:02:43.930> and<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.380> pc<00:02:45.100> at<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.220> same<00:02:45.430> time<00:02:45.640> and

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
my xbox and the pc at the same time and

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.750 
my xbox and the pc at the same time and
they're<00:02:46.630> not<00:02:46.720> really<00:02:46.930> anyway<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.830> same<00:02:48.100> kind

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
they're not really anyway the same kind

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.270 
they're not really anyway the same kind
of<00:02:48.850> like<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:48.970> one-second<00:02:49.840> delay<00:02:49.900> maybe<00:02:50.290> but<00:02:50.980> I

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
of like a one-second delay maybe but I

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.130 
of like a one-second delay maybe but I
certainly<00:02:51.520> wouldn't<00:02:51.790> recommend<00:02:52.180> playing<00:02:52.450> you
