00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.000 

both<00:00:01.710> devices<00:00:02.040> are<00:00:03.410> look<00:00:04.410> at<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:04.650> same<00:00:04.860> from

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.010 
both devices are look at the same from

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:06.890 
both devices are look at the same from
an<00:00:05.190> ID<00:00:05.340> perspective<00:00:06.030> so<00:00:06.450> if<00:00:06.510> you<00:00:06.570> look<00:00:06.720> at<00:00:06.810> the

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:06.900 
an ID perspective so if you look at the

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.959 
an ID perspective so if you look at the
device<00:00:07.200> it's<00:00:07.470> very<00:00:07.770> blackberry<00:00:08.280> iconic<00:00:08.790> it's

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:08.969 
device it's very blackberry iconic it's

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:11.900 
device it's very blackberry iconic it's
it<00:00:09.509> leverages<00:00:10.349> off<00:00:10.499> the<00:00:10.679> blackberry<00:00:11.099> bold

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
it leverages off the blackberry bold

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.239 
it leverages off the blackberry bold
9000<00:00:12.839> so<00:00:13.169> the<00:00:13.289> dimensions<00:00:13.709> of<00:00:13.829> this<00:00:13.950> device

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:14.249 
9000 so the dimensions of this device

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:16.730 
9000 so the dimensions of this device
are<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.579> same<00:00:14.789> as<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.209> as<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.629> 9000<00:00:16.350> but<00:00:16.560> it

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
are the same as that as the 9000 but it

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.740 
are the same as that as the 9000 but it
is<00:00:16.859> now<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.070> thinnest<00:00:17.550> blackberry<00:00:18.029> yet<00:00:18.269> so<00:00:18.539> if

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
is now the thinnest blackberry yet so if

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.620 
is now the thinnest blackberry yet so if
we're<00:00:18.990> given<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.740> side<00:00:20.220> shot<00:00:20.429> there<00:00:20.699> 10.5

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
we're given a side shot there 10.5

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.720 
we're given a side shot there 10.5
millimeters<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.160> thickness<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.609> this

sweet<00:01:10.670> from<00:01:11.840> talk<00:01:12.840> maybe<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.170> little<00:01:13.320> bit<00:01:13.500> more

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
sweet from talk maybe a little bit more

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.289 
sweet from talk maybe a little bit more
about<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.280> hardware<00:01:14.520> specs<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.150> this

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
deliver liquid graphics so that's really

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.819 
deliver liquid graphics so that's really
the<00:01:38.220> key<00:01:38.430> one<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.149> key<00:01:39.329> features<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.960> OS<00:01:40.380> 7

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
the key one of the key features in OS 7

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.249 
the key one of the key features in OS 7
is<00:01:41.220> just<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.729> liquid<00:01:42.270> graphics<00:01:42.659> capability

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
is just the liquid graphics capability

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.200 
is just the liquid graphics capability
essentially<00:01:43.770> what<00:01:43.950> we<00:01:44.070> did<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.490> we<00:01:44.700> got<00:01:45.060> our

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
essentially what we did is we got our

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.580 
essentially what we did is we got our
Hardware<00:01:45.479> guys<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.869> software<00:01:46.229> guys<00:01:46.350> together

Hardware guys and software guys together
and<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:48.259> basically<00:01:49.259> rewrote<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.070> graphics

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
and and basically rewrote the graphics

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.740 
and and basically rewrote the graphics
pipeline<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.969> take<00:01:51.119> advantage<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.630> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
pipeline to take advantage of the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.660
