stealth rock and I don't really know yet
if<00:01:22.330> I<00:01:22.450> should<00:01:22.810> switch<00:01:23.170> or<00:01:23.740> if<00:01:23.979> I<00:01:24.100> should<00:01:24.130> just

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
if I should switch or if I should just

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.770 
if I should switch or if I should just
let<00:01:24.550> this<00:01:24.700> thing<00:01:24.759> die<00:01:25.090> and<00:01:25.360> go<00:01:25.479> in<00:01:25.600> with

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
let this thing die and go in with

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.560 
let this thing die and go in with
something<00:01:26.050> else<00:01:26.200> I<00:01:27.060> probably<00:01:28.060> would<00:01:28.300> go<00:01:28.420> into

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
something else I probably would go into

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.560 
something else I probably would go into
Charizard<00:01:28.990> if<00:01:29.290> I<00:01:29.380> did<00:01:29.619> switch<00:01:29.950> but<00:01:30.790> uh<00:01:30.820> at<00:01:31.540> that

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
Charizard if I did switch but uh at that

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.620 
Charizard if I did switch but uh at that
point<00:01:31.750> still<00:01:32.320> a<00:01:32.350> speed<00:01:32.770> tie<00:01:33.070> and<00:01:33.490> I<00:01:34.240> don't<00:01:34.479> know

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
point still a speed tie and I don't know

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.450 
point still a speed tie and I don't know
exactly<00:01:35.440> how<00:01:35.530> stuff<00:01:35.830> would<00:01:35.979> play<00:01:36.160> out<00:01:36.280> from

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
exactly how stuff would play out from

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.210 
exactly how stuff would play out from
there<00:01:37.140> he<00:01:38.140> is<00:01:38.170> taunted<00:01:38.710> of<00:01:38.800> course<00:01:39.009> so<00:01:39.130> we

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
there he is taunted of course so we

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.700 
there he is taunted of course so we
can't<00:01:39.430> use<00:01:39.520> hypnosis<00:01:39.700> but<00:01:40.450> whatever<00:01:41.440> I<00:01:41.530> ended

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
can't use hypnosis but whatever I ended

up just staying in so I wasn't able to

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.170 
up just staying in so I wasn't able to
get<00:01:44.200> anything<00:01:44.380> else<00:01:44.649> up<00:01:44.890> and<00:01:45.190> I'm<00:01:45.759> down<00:01:46.000> one

is gonna do absolutely nothing which is
going<00:01:50.530> to<00:01:50.650> allow<00:01:50.890> me<00:01:50.920> to<00:01:51.130> get<00:01:51.370> up<00:01:51.520> a<00:01:51.610> substitute

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
going to allow me to get up a substitute

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.300

tall wears off but it doesn't matter

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.030 
tall wears off but it doesn't matter
because<00:01:54.460> he's<00:01:54.580> stuck<00:01:54.820> on<00:01:54.850> energy<00:01:55.240> ball<00:01:55.390> now<00:01:55.570> so

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
because he's stuck on energy ball now so

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.700 
because he's stuck on energy ball now so
cool<00:01:57.040> beans<00:01:57.250> for<00:01:57.550> me<00:01:57.670> in<00:01:58.600> comes<00:01:58.900> a<00:01:59.170> drift<00:01:59.500> blue

what he wants to do since the thing that
I<00:02:15.910> know<00:02:15.970> he<00:02:16.209> could<00:02:16.540> do<00:02:16.780> is<00:02:17.049> not<00:02:17.500> gonna<00:02:18.220> be<00:02:18.459> what

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
I know he could do is not gonna be what

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.729 
I know he could do is not gonna be what
he's<00:02:18.760> going<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:19.060> do<00:02:19.299> but<00:02:19.989> uh<00:02:20.019> yeah<00:02:20.410> when<00:02:20.560> we<00:02:20.620> get

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
he's going to do but uh yeah when we get

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.440 
he's going to do but uh yeah when we get
have<00:02:20.830> some<00:02:20.950> leech<00:02:21.130> seed<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:21.430> I'm<00:02:21.700> faster<00:02:22.180> so<00:02:22.360> I

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
have some leech seed and I'm faster so I

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.150 
have some leech seed and I'm faster so I
can<00:02:22.630> sit<00:02:22.810> in<00:02:22.840> here<00:02:22.959> all<00:02:23.110> day<00:02:23.500> long<00:02:23.769> so<00:02:24.130> I

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
can sit in here all day long so I

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.810 
can sit in here all day long so I
honestly<00:02:24.370> don't<00:02:24.850> even<00:02:24.940> care<00:02:25.299> I<00:02:25.690> don't<00:02:25.989> care<00:02:26.820> so

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
honestly don't even care I don't care so

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.160 
honestly don't even care I don't care so
I'm<00:02:27.910> just<00:02:28.000> gonna<00:02:28.090> keep<00:02:28.299> setting<00:02:28.600> up<00:02:28.660> subs<00:02:29.019> and

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
I'm just gonna keep setting up subs and

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.570 
I'm just gonna keep setting up subs and
in<00:02:29.260> comes<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.530> victory<00:02:29.860> bell<00:02:30.010> which<00:02:30.250> makes<00:02:30.430> me

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
in comes a victory bell which makes me

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.840 
in comes a victory bell which makes me
think

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
think

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.140 
think
hmm<00:02:31.239> maybe<00:02:31.900> he's<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.260> sunny<00:02:32.650> day<00:02:33.010> team<00:02:33.400> cuz<00:02:34.060> he

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
hmm maybe he's a sunny day team cuz he

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.850 
hmm maybe he's a sunny day team cuz he
did<00:02:34.330> have<00:02:34.450> nine<00:02:34.690> tails<00:02:35.019> and<00:02:35.410> he<00:02:35.470> does<00:02:35.650> have

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
did have nine tails and he does have

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.400 
did have nine tails and he does have
that<00:02:36.100> thing<00:02:36.489> and<00:02:36.850> sunny<00:02:37.690> day<00:02:37.870> would<00:02:38.019> be<00:02:38.080> really

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
that thing and sunny day would be really

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.680 
that thing and sunny day would be really
cool<00:02:38.590> for<00:02:39.040> jump<00:02:39.340> cloth<00:02:39.580> but<00:02:40.269> it<00:02:40.390> wouldn't<00:02:40.600> be

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
cool for jump cloth but it wouldn't be

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.199 
cool for jump cloth but it wouldn't be
good<00:02:40.840> for<00:02:40.900> floatzel<00:02:41.590> it'd<00:02:42.100> be<00:02:42.400> neutral<00:02:43.030> for

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
good for floatzel it'd be neutral for

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.150 
good for floatzel it'd be neutral for
Charizard<00:02:43.780> cuz<00:02:44.080> it<00:02:44.290> doesn't<00:02:44.650> help<00:02:44.769> his<00:02:44.890> speed

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
Charizard cuz it doesn't help his speed

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.340 
Charizard cuz it doesn't help his speed
any<00:02:45.340> I<00:02:45.610> got<00:02:46.120> nothing<00:02:46.450> to<00:02:46.540> do<00:02:46.660> when<00:02:46.810> I<00:02:46.870> got<00:02:47.019> a<00:02:47.049> sub

any I got nothing to do when I got a sub

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.930 
any I got nothing to do when I got a sub
so<00:02:47.620> I'm<00:02:47.709> just<00:02:47.890> gonna<00:02:48.070> decide<00:02:48.400> to<00:02:48.549> put<00:02:48.760> it<00:02:48.850> to

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
so I'm just gonna decide to put it to

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.470 
so I'm just gonna decide to put it to

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
so I went with air slash to flinched I

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.170 
so I went with air slash to flinched I
get<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:18.980> flinch<00:03:19.250> but<00:03:19.489> it<00:03:19.610> doesn't<00:03:20.000> matter

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
get the flinch but it doesn't matter

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.000 
get the flinch but it doesn't matter

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
because he lives at nine hitpoints and

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.780 
because he lives at nine hitpoints and

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
blows up on my Zord anyway so of course

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.460 
blows up on my Zord anyway so of course
in<00:03:26.030> hindsight<00:03:26.420> it<00:03:26.900> would<00:03:27.110> have<00:03:27.230> been<00:03:27.349> much

doesn't do that much and he now resists

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.490 
doesn't do that much and he now resists
pretty<00:03:47.120> much<00:03:47.269> everything<00:03:47.959> that<00:03:48.140> I<00:03:48.170> packed

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
pretty much everything that I packed

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.940 
pretty much everything that I packed
which<00:03:48.829> sucks<00:03:49.250> for<00:03:49.370> me<00:03:49.519> so<00:03:50.299> I<00:03:50.599> go<00:03:51.079> into<00:03:51.319> jumpluff

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
which sucks for me so I go into jumpluff

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.920 
which sucks for me so I go into jumpluff
just<00:03:52.640> in<00:03:52.730> case<00:03:52.879> he<00:03:53.000> wants<00:03:53.180> to<00:03:53.269> sunny<00:03:53.480> day<00:03:53.690> now

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
just in case he wants to sunny day now

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.599 
just in case he wants to sunny day now
I'm<00:03:54.079> almost<00:03:54.349> guaranteeing<00:03:55.010> he<00:03:55.220> has<00:03:55.310> a<00:03:55.340> sunny

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
I'm almost guaranteeing he has a sunny

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.789 
I'm almost guaranteeing he has a sunny
day<00:03:55.819> which<00:03:56.180> he<00:03:56.299> does<00:03:56.480> which<00:03:57.200> I<00:03:57.379> can<00:03:57.560> go<00:03:57.680> ahead

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
day which he does which I can go ahead

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.610 
day which he does which I can go ahead
and<00:03:57.920> on<00:03:58.190> course<00:03:58.549> since<00:03:58.760> I<00:03:58.819> have<00:03:59.019> 700<00:04:00.019> freakin

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
and on course since I have 700 freakin

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.430 
and on course since I have 700 freakin
speed<00:04:01.010> so<00:04:01.760> he's<00:04:01.940> definitely<00:04:02.419> not<00:04:02.810> gonna<00:04:03.169> be<00:04:03.410> a

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
speed so he's definitely not gonna be a

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.430 
speed so he's definitely not gonna be a
out<00:04:03.829> speeding<00:04:04.160> jumpluff<00:04:04.669> ever<00:04:05.030> with<00:04:05.780> anything

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
out speeding jumpluff ever with anything

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.289 
out speeding jumpluff ever with anything
and<00:04:07.040> then<00:04:07.160> just<00:04:07.400> would<00:04:07.579> need<00:04:07.730> like<00:04:07.940> four

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
and then just would need like four

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.869 
and then just would need like four
boosts<00:04:08.900> to<00:04:09.049> outspeed<00:04:09.530> me<00:04:09.680> anyway<00:04:09.980> so<00:04:10.700> he's

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 
boosts to outspeed me anyway so he's

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:12.789 
boosts to outspeed me anyway so he's
stuck<00:04:11.120> on<00:04:11.269> that<00:04:11.510> I<00:04:11.750> can't<00:04:12.260> put<00:04:12.410> anything<00:04:12.590> to

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
stuck on that I can't put anything to

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.039 
stuck on that I can't put anything to
sleep<00:04:13.010> and<00:04:13.310> I<00:04:13.910> can't<00:04:14.180> leave<00:04:14.359> seeing<00:04:14.690> two<00:04:14.930> of

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
sleep and I can't leave seeing two of

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.810 
sleep and I can't leave seeing two of
his<00:04:15.230> guys<00:04:15.410> so<00:04:15.680> it's<00:04:15.799> really<00:04:16.099> not<00:04:16.250> cool<00:04:16.459> for<00:04:16.519> me

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
I switched out to this guy which may

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.800 
I switched out to this guy which may
look<00:04:19.340> weird<00:04:19.669> to<00:04:19.940> him<00:04:20.060> at<00:04:20.180> first<00:04:20.419> as<00:04:20.599> it's<00:04:20.750> a

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
look weird to him at first as it's a

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.420 
look weird to him at first as it's a
water<00:04:21.019> poke<00:04:21.289> but<00:04:21.530> obviously<00:04:21.950> I've<00:04:22.099> got<00:04:22.250> ice

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
water poke but obviously I've got ice

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.540 
water poke but obviously I've got ice
punch<00:04:22.729> so<00:04:23.419> I'm<00:04:23.510> not<00:04:23.630> too<00:04:23.960> concerned<00:04:24.229> and<00:04:24.710> I

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
punch so I'm not too concerned and I

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.550 
punch so I'm not too concerned and I
know<00:04:26.000> that<00:04:26.210> despite<00:04:26.479> the<00:04:26.750> sunny<00:04:26.960> day<00:04:27.199> is<00:04:27.349> up

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
know that despite the sunny day is up

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.589 
know that despite the sunny day is up
it's<00:04:28.190> not<00:04:28.430> going<00:04:28.760> to<00:04:28.880> be<00:04:29.030> as<00:04:29.210> if<00:04:29.389> or<00:04:29.570> the

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:29.599 
it's not going to be as if or the

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:31.659 
it's not going to be as if or the
waterfall<00:04:30.080> isn't<00:04:30.710> gonna<00:04:30.800> be<00:04:30.949> as<00:04:31.099> effective

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
waterfall isn't gonna be as effective

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.640 
waterfall isn't gonna be as effective
but<00:04:32.240> it's<00:04:32.389> still<00:04:32.510> super<00:04:32.720> effective<00:04:33.229> and<00:04:33.410> life

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
but it's still super effective and life

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.529 
but it's still super effective and life
orb<00:04:33.919> and<00:04:34.130> stab<00:04:34.370> and<00:04:34.639> I<00:04:34.699> kind<00:04:34.970> of<00:04:35.030> just<00:04:35.180> had<00:04:35.389> to

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
orb and stab and I kind of just had to

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:37.420 
orb and stab and I kind of just had to
go<00:04:35.690> for<00:04:35.960> it<00:04:36.050> I<00:04:36.110> was<00:04:36.199> expecting<00:04:36.740> to<00:04:36.860> die<00:04:37.010> from<00:04:37.310> a

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
go for it I was expecting to die from a

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.270 
go for it I was expecting to die from a
retaliatory<00:04:38.169> energy<00:04:39.169> ball<00:04:39.380> but<00:04:39.620> he<00:04:40.070> went<00:04:40.220> for

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
retaliatory energy ball but he went for

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.580 
retaliatory energy ball but he went for
hypnosis<00:04:40.669> and<00:04:40.940> a<00:04:41.030> mist<00:04:41.300> which<00:04:41.570> is<00:04:41.720> absolutely

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
hypnosis and a mist which is absolutely

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.320 
hypnosis and a mist which is absolutely
amazing<00:04:42.830> to<00:04:43.099> me<00:04:43.220> and<00:04:43.310> that<00:04:43.400> was<00:04:43.520> probably<00:04:43.910> the

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
amazing to me and that was probably the

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.439 
amazing to me and that was probably the
move<00:04:44.570> of<00:04:44.810> the<00:04:44.840> match<00:04:45.280> if<00:04:46.280> I<00:04:46.430> ended<00:04:46.639> up<00:04:46.760> dying<00:04:47.060> or

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
move of the match if I ended up dying or

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.270 
move of the match if I ended up dying or
getting<00:04:47.599> put<00:04:47.960> to<00:04:47.990> sleep<00:04:48.229> but<00:04:49.039> more

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
getting put to sleep but more

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.640 
getting put to sleep but more
importantly<00:04:49.699> just<00:04:49.789> dying<00:04:50.120> you<00:04:50.419> uh<00:04:50.530> these<00:04:51.530> were

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
importantly just dying you uh these were

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
waterfall just to see what it's going on

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.900 
waterfall just to see what it's going on
and<00:05:06.750> it<00:05:07.200> doesn't<00:05:07.470> do<00:05:07.560> very<00:05:07.590> much<00:05:07.860> so<00:05:08.280> that

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
and it doesn't do very much so that

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.240 
and it doesn't do very much so that
leads<00:05:09.180> me<00:05:09.330> to<00:05:09.450> want<00:05:09.990> to<00:05:10.080> switch<00:05:10.440> out<00:05:10.620> but<00:05:11.190> I

piece of junk I go out to him because I

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.630 
piece of junk I go out to him because I
know<00:05:21.930> with<00:05:22.410> the<00:05:22.560> moves<00:05:22.770> he's<00:05:23.010> got<00:05:23.220> and<00:05:23.490> the

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
know with the moves he's got and the

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.670 
know with the moves he's got and the
pokes<00:05:23.880> he's<00:05:24.090> up<00:05:24.270> against<00:05:24.720> he<00:05:25.230> doesn't<00:05:25.530> really

pokes he's up against he doesn't really
have<00:05:25.800> anything<00:05:26.370> productive<00:05:27.300> to<00:05:27.720> do<00:05:27.900> so<00:05:28.560> I<00:05:28.860> go<00:05:29.370> a

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
have anything productive to do so I go a

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.920 
have anything productive to do so I go a
fake-out<00:05:29.820> just<00:05:30.090> because<00:05:30.270> that's<00:05:30.420> kind<00:05:30.690> of<00:05:30.780> his

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
fake-out just because that's kind of his

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.630 
fake-out just because that's kind of his
point<00:05:31.290> in<00:05:31.560> case<00:05:31.710> he<00:05:31.830> didn't<00:05:32.040> want<00:05:32.250> to<00:05:32.400> switch

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
point in case he didn't want to switch

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.300 
point in case he didn't want to switch
there<00:05:33.210> would<00:05:33.300> have<00:05:33.360> been<00:05:33.480> my<00:05:33.600> best<00:05:33.810> choice<00:05:34.310> but

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
there would have been my best choice but

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.040 
there would have been my best choice but
I'm<00:05:35.430> not<00:05:35.580> also<00:05:35.880> not<00:05:36.030> afraid<00:05:36.330> of<00:05:36.360> drifblim<00:05:36.660> so

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
I'm not also not afraid of drifblim so

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.570 
I'm not also not afraid of drifblim so
out<00:05:37.200> I<00:05:37.470> figured<00:05:37.770> if<00:05:38.100> he<00:05:38.160> does<00:05:38.310> want<00:05:38.430> to<00:05:38.520> make

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
out I figured if he does want to make

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.580 
out I figured if he does want to make
that<00:05:38.820> switch<00:05:39.090> that's<00:05:39.270> cool<00:05:39.570> because<00:05:39.900> it's<00:05:40.440> the

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
that switch that's cool because it's the

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.680 
that switch that's cool because it's the
only<00:05:40.740> guy<00:05:41.190> I<00:05:41.220> can<00:05:41.400> really<00:05:41.880> kill<00:05:42.090> with<00:05:42.300> medicham

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
only guy I can really kill with medicham

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.900 
only guy I can really kill with medicham
on<00:05:42.960> this<00:05:43.080> team<00:05:43.290> at<00:05:43.440> this<00:05:43.590> moment<00:05:43.980> so<00:05:44.250> that's

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
on this team at this moment so that's

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.750 
on this team at this moment so that's
what<00:05:45.030> I<00:05:45.060> do<00:05:45.240> and<00:05:46.100> pretty<00:05:47.100> much<00:05:47.190> everything

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
what I do and pretty much everything

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.850 
what I do and pretty much everything
else<00:05:47.850> is<00:05:48.120> going<00:05:48.870> to<00:05:49.020> resist<00:05:49.350> either<00:05:49.620> the

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
else is going to resist either the

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.430 
else is going to resist either the
fighting<00:05:50.280> or<00:05:50.670> electric<00:05:51.570> and<00:05:52.080> I<00:05:52.110> can't<00:05:52.350> use

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
fighting or electric and I can't use

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.130 
fighting or electric and I can't use
fake-out<00:05:52.860> anymore<00:05:53.280> so<00:05:53.700> um<00:05:54.180> I<00:05:54.600> go<00:05:54.720> with<00:05:54.870> bullet

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140 
fake-out anymore so um I go with bullet

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.750 
fake-out anymore so um I go with bullet
punch<00:05:55.320> just<00:05:55.500> to<00:05:55.620> get<00:05:55.740> some<00:05:55.980> damage<00:05:56.220> on<00:05:56.460> there<00:05:56.730> I

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
punch just to get some damage on there I

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.730 
punch just to get some damage on there I
see<00:05:57.060> a<00:05:57.090> life<00:05:57.360> orb<00:05:57.660> which<00:05:57.810> is<00:05:57.930> oh<00:05:58.140> that's<00:05:58.500> cool

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
see a life orb which is oh that's cool

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.340 
see a life orb which is oh that's cool
life<00:05:59.070> or<00:05:59.340> but<00:05:59.580> unfortunately<00:06:00.090> there's<00:06:00.300> Sun<00:06:00.600> so

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350 
life or but unfortunately there's Sun so

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.170 
life or but unfortunately there's Sun so
the<00:06:01.470> only<00:06:01.620> thing<00:06:01.920> I've<00:06:02.040> got<00:06:02.070> to<00:06:02.460> outspeed<00:06:02.910> is

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
the only thing I've got to outspeed is

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.330 
the only thing I've got to outspeed is
going<00:06:03.480> to<00:06:03.570> be<00:06:03.660> jump<00:06:03.900> off<00:06:04.220> which<00:06:05.220> is

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
going to be jump off which is

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.920 
going to be jump off which is
immediately<00:06:05.970> what<00:06:06.150> I<00:06:06.180> do<00:06:06.300> I<00:06:06.600> thought<00:06:06.840> about

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
immediately what I do I thought about

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.180 
immediately what I do I thought about
why<00:06:07.170> I<00:06:07.200> guess<00:06:07.350> not<00:06:07.470> immediately<00:06:07.950> because<00:06:08.160> I

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
why I guess not immediately because I

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.650 
why I guess not immediately because I
thought<00:06:08.430> about<00:06:08.640> going<00:06:08.970> to<00:06:09.000> electrode<00:06:09.570> a

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
thought about going to electrode a

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.600 
thought about going to electrode a
little<00:06:09.960> bit<00:06:10.110> I<00:06:10.320> wasn't<00:06:10.890> sure<00:06:11.010> if<00:06:11.130> electrode

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
little bit I wasn't sure if electrode

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:12.860 
little bit I wasn't sure if electrode
would<00:06:11.850> live<00:06:12.090> psychic

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
would live psychic

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.740 
would live psychic
so<00:06:13.350> I<00:06:13.710> decided<00:06:14.280> against<00:06:14.730> it<00:06:14.850> I<00:06:14.970> want<00:06:15.210> to<00:06:15.330> sub

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
so I decided against it I want to sub

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.560 
so I decided against it I want to sub
out<00:06:15.930> his<00:06:16.230> turns<00:06:16.530> of<00:06:16.710> Sun<00:06:17.010> and<00:06:17.280> then<00:06:17.820> encore<00:06:18.360> him

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
out his turns of Sun and then encore him

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.320 
out his turns of Sun and then encore him
onto<00:06:18.930> psychic<00:06:19.350> so<00:06:19.560> that<00:06:19.680> he<00:06:19.800> can't<00:06:20.070> get<00:06:20.330> excuse

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
onto psychic so that he can't get excuse

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.350 
onto psychic so that he can't get excuse
me<00:06:21.450> so<00:06:21.840> he<00:06:21.990> can't<00:06:22.260> get<00:06:22.410> any<00:06:22.470> more<00:06:22.950> Sun<00:06:23.340> and<00:06:24.210> that

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
me so he can't get any more Sun and that

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.360 
me so he can't get any more Sun and that
will<00:06:24.510> allow<00:06:24.750> float<00:06:25.170> so<00:06:25.410> and<00:06:25.680> electrode<00:06:26.190> to

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
will allow float so and electrode to

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.790 
will allow float so and electrode to
speed<00:06:26.760> everything<00:06:27.080> along<00:06:28.080> with<00:06:28.320> keeping<00:06:28.650> his

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
speed everything along with keeping his

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.310 
speed everything along with keeping his
sleeping<00:06:29.250> guy<00:06:29.430> all<00:06:29.700> but<00:06:29.910> worthless<00:06:30.090> so<00:06:31.050> that's

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.320 
sleeping guy all but worthless so that's

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.220 
sleeping guy all but worthless so that's
what<00:06:31.470> I<00:06:31.500> do<00:06:32.450> at<00:06:33.450> one<00:06:33.600> point<00:06:33.720> I<00:06:33.840> thought<00:06:34.020> are

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.230 
what I do at one point I thought are

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.930 
what I do at one point I thought are
originally<00:06:34.710> I<00:06:34.770> thought<00:06:34.980> maybe<00:06:35.280> if<00:06:35.490> I<00:06:35.580> just<00:06:35.760> on

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 
originally I thought maybe if I just on

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.870 
originally I thought maybe if I just on
cord<00:06:36.270> at<00:06:36.780> the<00:06:36.960> very<00:06:37.140> start<00:06:37.500> that'd<00:06:38.490> be<00:06:38.610> cool

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 
cord at the very start that'd be cool

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.410 
cord at the very start that'd be cool
perhaps<00:06:39.570> I<00:06:39.780> could<00:06:39.840> live<00:06:40.170> it<00:06:40.580> if<00:06:41.580> I<00:06:41.850> don't<00:06:42.120> maybe

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:42.420 
perhaps I could live it if I don't maybe

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.210 
perhaps I could live it if I don't maybe
life<00:06:42.720> Ward<00:06:42.990> would<00:06:43.110> kill<00:06:43.320> him<00:06:43.530> I<00:06:43.710> didn't<00:06:44.040> know

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 
life Ward would kill him I didn't know

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.060 
life Ward would kill him I didn't know
but<00:06:45.000> uh<00:06:45.470> depending<00:06:46.470> on<00:06:46.590> how<00:06:46.650> that<00:06:46.710> played<00:06:47.040> out

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.070 
but uh depending on how that played out

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.070 
but uh depending on how that played out
he<00:06:47.520> would<00:06:47.670> still<00:06:47.940> have<00:06:48.120> the<00:06:48.270> Sun<00:06:48.510> going<00:06:48.720> on<00:06:48.960> at

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 
he would still have the Sun going on at

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.080 
he would still have the Sun going on at
the<00:06:49.170> time<00:06:49.380> so<00:06:50.070> that's<00:06:50.250> probably<00:06:50.610> not<00:06:50.850> the<00:06:50.910> best

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.090 
the time so that's probably not the best

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:52.280 
the time so that's probably not the best
way<00:06:51.390> to<00:06:51.420> go<00:06:51.600> about<00:06:51.690> things

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:52.290 
way to go about things

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.100 
way to go about things
so<00:06:52.560> I<00:06:53.000> encore<00:06:54.000> him<00:06:54.180> no<00:06:54.360> big<00:06:54.540> deal<00:06:54.690> he<00:06:54.840> said<00:06:55.020> he

so<00:07:15.570> I'm<00:07:15.960> gonna<00:07:16.110> go<00:07:16.259> immediately<00:07:16.500> to<00:07:16.740> electrode

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 
so I'm gonna go immediately to electrode

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.980 
so I'm gonna go immediately to electrode
I<00:07:17.400> have<00:07:17.580> no<00:07:17.789> idea<00:07:18.090> what<00:07:18.210> its<00:07:18.330> gonna<00:07:18.389> do<00:07:18.660> but<00:07:18.900> I'm

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:18.990 
I have no idea what its gonna do but I'm

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.770 
I have no idea what its gonna do but I'm
probably<00:07:19.320> just<00:07:19.560> gonna<00:07:19.860> blow<00:07:20.160> up<00:07:20.280> immediately

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:20.780 
probably just gonna blow up immediately

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.760 
probably just gonna blow up immediately
instead<00:07:21.780> he<00:07:21.990> blows<00:07:22.259> up

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:22.770 
instead he blows up

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.499 
instead he blows up
so<00:07:22.979> regardless<00:07:23.520> it's<00:07:23.789> the<00:07:23.880> exact<00:07:24.419> same

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:24.509 
so regardless it's the exact same

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:27.200 
so regardless it's the exact same
solution<00:07:24.870> as<00:07:25.259> if<00:07:25.410> he<00:07:25.560> used<00:07:26.490> some<00:07:26.729> move<00:07:26.910> in<00:07:27.060> and

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.210 
solution as if he used some move in and

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.240 
solution as if he used some move in and
I<00:07:27.360> blow<00:07:27.600> up<00:07:27.810> so<00:07:28.050> that's<00:07:28.139> fine<00:07:28.289> and<00:07:28.740> that<00:07:29.100> leaves

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:29.250 
I blow up so that's fine and that leaves

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.920 
I blow up so that's fine and that leaves
me<00:07:29.370> with<00:07:29.490> my<00:07:29.729> ice<00:07:29.880> punch<00:07:30.180> versus<00:07:30.449> a<00:07:30.509> sleeping

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:30.930

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.770 
me with my ice punch versus a sleeping
