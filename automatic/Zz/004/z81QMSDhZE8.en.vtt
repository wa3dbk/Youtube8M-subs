00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.930
 the Italian composer Antonio Vivaldi 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.080
 in the fall as his violin concertos the four seasons world famous tunes 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.170
 the Frankfurters missing Detlef Steffenhagen has the work of Vivaldi of 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.390
 1725 always very good and because he no organ version of it 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.340
 The four seasons could be for him 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.340
 Rewritten favorite instrument without further ado 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.620
 this third set of Vivaldi's four seasons from the fall 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.540
 shows especially that I like this piece very well for the organ and that 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.790
 I was also fascinated to edit those for the organ you can both 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.880
 Tomorrow instrument with certain registers such as trumpet or Comoros still 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.230
 much more clearly this hunting scene as described by Vivaldi represents 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.030
 the hunting horns that sound are really composed by him as well 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.710
 whether it is written for Dorner and in the original usually the final version 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.710
 it does not come to fruition 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.289
 With his concert program Steffen Hagen has the audience on his side 

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:16.769
 because for the church 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.949
 It's no problem for them to get everything moving 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:22.549
 given walcker organ 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.549

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:46.549
