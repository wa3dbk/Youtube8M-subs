00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
pruning on the cordon trained vines the

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.850 
pruning on the cordon trained vines the
classic<00:00:11.519> two<00:00:11.910> bud<00:00:12.150> spur<00:00:12.450> pruning<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:13.710> have

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
classic two bud spur pruning you have

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.670 
classic two bud spur pruning you have
the<00:00:14.009> trunk<00:00:14.809> two<00:00:15.809> arms<00:00:16.170> which<00:00:16.320> are<00:00:16.470> called

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
the trunk two arms which are called

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.540 
the trunk two arms which are called
Corden's

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
Corden's

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.269 
Corden's
so<00:00:18.150> you'll<00:00:18.330> have<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.510> cordon<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.680> spur<00:00:19.980> and

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
so you'll have a cordon and a spur and

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.400 
so you'll have a cordon and a spur and
two<00:00:20.609> buds<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.810> first<00:00:22.050> thing<00:00:22.199> we're<00:00:22.320> going

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
two buds so the first thing we're going

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.380 
two buds so the first thing we're going
to<00:00:22.470> do<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.710> show<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.130> classic<00:00:23.910> two<00:00:24.150> bud

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
to do is show you the classic two bud

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.689 
to do is show you the classic two bud
spur<00:00:24.859> which<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.420> based<00:00:27.420> on<00:00:27.720> one-year-old<00:00:28.260> wood

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
spur which is based on one-year-old wood

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.659 
spur which is based on one-year-old wood
this<00:00:29.699> for<00:00:30.390> fruit<00:00:30.720> last<00:00:31.019> year<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.489> going

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
this for fruit last year this is going

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.240 
this for fruit last year this is going
to<00:00:32.759> bear<00:00:32.940> fruit<00:00:32.969> this<00:00:33.480> year<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:34.530> we<00:00:34.680> cut<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.010> off

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
to bear fruit this year so we cut it off

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.040 
to bear fruit this year so we cut it off
here<00:00:35.520> where<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.969> 1<00:00:36.149> year<00:00:36.329> old<00:00:36.510> wood<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.870> from

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
here where the 1 year old wood is from

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.440 
here where the 1 year old wood is from
and<00:00:37.410> we<00:00:37.620> keep<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.520> one<00:00:38.790> for<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.210> year's

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
and we keep this one for this year's

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.520 
and we keep this one for this year's
fruit<00:00:44.239> now<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.480> process<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.170> deciding

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
fruit now in the process of deciding

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.750 
fruit now in the process of deciding
what<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.340> do

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
what to do

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.410 
what to do
vine<00:00:48.239> balance<00:00:48.950> size<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.309> core<00:00:50.940> Dawn's<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
vine balance size of the core Dawn's the

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.100 
vine balance size of the core Dawn's the
arms<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.739> size<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:54.000> shoots<00:00:54.360> all<00:00:54.690> enter

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
arms the size of the shoots all enter

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.689 
arms the size of the shoots all enter
into<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.500> for<00:00:55.680> instance<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> size<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.579> this

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
into it for instance the size of this

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.970 
into it for instance the size of this
chute<00:00:57.170> compared<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.440> sue<00:00:58.710> shoot

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
chute compared to this sue shoot

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.650 
chute compared to this sue shoot
obviously<00:00:59.550> this<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> stronger<00:01:00.449> one<00:01:00.600> than

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
obviously this is a stronger one than

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.529 
obviously this is a stronger one than
this<00:01:01.410> one<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.460> influences<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.329> vine

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
this one so that influences the vine

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.359 
this one so that influences the vine
balance<00:01:04.049> again<00:01:04.559> if<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.799> notice<00:01:05.129> these<00:01:05.309> are

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
balance again if you notice these are

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.210 
balance again if you notice these are
cut<00:01:05.760> short<00:01:05.869> we<00:01:06.869> did<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.290> because<00:01:07.740> we<00:01:07.770> did

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
cut short we did this because we did

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.820 
cut short we did this because we did
what's<00:01:08.490> called<00:01:08.760> double<00:01:08.970> pruning<00:01:09.570> for<00:01:10.530> me<00:01:10.650> it's

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
what's called double pruning for me it's

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.469 
what's called double pruning for me it's
easier<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.250> go<00:01:11.400> through<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> vineyard<00:01:12.000> with

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
easier to go through a vineyard with

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.020 
easier to go through a vineyard with
things<00:01:13.020> cut<00:01:13.350> down<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.830> maybe<00:01:14.040> 12<00:01:14.400> inches<00:01:14.820> above

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
things cut down to maybe 12 inches above

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.870 
things cut down to maybe 12 inches above
the<00:01:15.509> cordon<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.920> you're<00:01:17.070> not<00:01:17.159> battling<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
the cordon so you're not battling the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.230 
the cordon so you're not battling the
long<00:01:18.119> wood<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.470> tendrils<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.280> come<00:01:21.030> off

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
long wood and the tendrils that come off

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.240 
long wood and the tendrils that come off
and<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.810> really<00:01:22.049> be<00:01:22.200> difficult<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.950> get<00:01:23.070> off

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
and can really be difficult to get off

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.490 
and can really be difficult to get off
the<00:01:23.460> wire<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.479> sort<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.750> decreases<00:01:25.320> your

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
the wire so it sort of decreases your

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.800 
the wire so it sort of decreases your
manual<00:01:25.950> labor<00:01:26.159> gives<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.060> chance<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.630> look

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
manual labor gives you a chance to look

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.109 
manual labor gives you a chance to look
at<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.200> whole<00:01:28.409> vine<00:01:28.710> without<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.460> mass<00:01:29.820> of

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
at the whole vine without a mass of

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.200 
at the whole vine without a mass of
woody<00:01:31.020> shoots<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.619> are<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> year<00:01:32.040> old<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
woody shoots that are a year old the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.469 
woody shoots that are a year old the
next<00:01:33.240> thing<00:01:33.600> we're<00:01:33.720> going<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.900> do<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:35.100> show<00:01:35.369> you

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
next thing we're going to do is show you

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:44.389 
next thing we're going to do is show you
a<00:01:36.479> situation<00:01:38.900> like<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.640> in<00:01:41.640> which<00:01:43.159> you<00:01:44.159> have

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
a situation like this in which you have

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:52.539 
a situation like this in which you have
1<00:01:45.329> year<00:01:45.479> old<00:01:45.689> wood<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.829> have<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:51.500> spur

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
1 year old wood and you have a spur

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.410 
1 year old wood and you have a spur
that's<00:01:54.439> closer<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.710> cordon<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.210> much

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
that's closer to the cordon this is much

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.929 
that's closer to the cordon this is much
too<00:01:57.689> long<00:01:57.899> here<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:59.219> might<00:01:59.460> be<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.670> better

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
too long here this might be a better

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.039 
too long here this might be a better
example<00:02:00.770> here<00:02:01.770> we<00:02:01.920> have<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.340> cordon<00:02:02.899> here<00:02:03.899> we

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
example here we have the cordon here we

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.170 
example here we have the cordon here we
have<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.619> shoot<00:02:05.130> but<00:02:05.399> it's<00:02:05.579> not<00:02:05.790> from

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
have a shoot but it's not from

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.969 
have a shoot but it's not from
one-year-old<00:02:06.689> wood<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.439> one<00:02:07.649> year<00:02:07.829> old

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
one-year-old wood this is one year old

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.479 
one-year-old wood this is one year old
wood<00:02:08.390> this<00:02:09.390> gave<00:02:09.720> fruit<00:02:10.020> last<00:02:10.319> year<00:02:10.709> this<00:02:11.370> is

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
wood this gave fruit last year this is

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.280

going to give fruit this year and we're

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.390 
going to give fruit this year and we're
going<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.500> save<00:02:13.739> this<00:02:13.950> one

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
going to save this one

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.809 
going to save this one
for<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.360> following<00:02:15.780> year<00:02:16.319> so<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:17.310> gets<00:02:17.489> closer

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
for the following year so it gets closer

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.460 
for the following year so it gets closer
to<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.500> cordon<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:20.069> idea<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.849> always<00:02:21.120> have

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
to the cordon the idea is to always have

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.979 
to the cordon the idea is to always have
the<00:02:22.470> fruit-bearing<00:02:23.220> shoot<00:02:24.060> as<00:02:24.299> close<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.870> the

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
the fruit-bearing shoot as close to the

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:32.630 
the fruit-bearing shoot as close to the
cordon<00:02:25.409> as<00:02:25.620> possible<00:02:30.920> so<00:02:31.920> here<00:02:32.159> this<00:02:32.340> is<00:02:32.400> going

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
cordon as possible so here this is going

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.390 
cordon as possible so here this is going
to<00:02:32.730> give<00:02:32.879> us<00:02:32.909> fruit<00:02:33.269> this<00:02:34.140> will<00:02:34.349> sprout<00:02:35.159> up
