I<00:00:22.550> think<00:00:23.550> Glock<00:00:23.880> probably<00:00:24.539> kind<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.869> stole

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
I think Glock probably kind of stole

I think Glock probably kind of stole
this<00:00:25.500> idea<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:26.430> got<00:00:26.779> to<00:00:27.779> break<00:00:27.960> down<00:00:28.170> levers

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
this idea you got to break down levers

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.439 
this idea you got to break down levers
on<00:00:28.680> either<00:00:28.710> side<00:00:29.130> just<00:00:29.160> kind<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.699> pop<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.300> down

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
on either side just kind of pop it down

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.459 
on either side just kind of pop it down

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
block so that I have

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.139 
block so that I have
basically<00:01:28.680> two<00:01:29.310> separate<00:01:29.640> barrels<00:01:29.820> for<00:01:30.060> the

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
basically two separate barrels for the

or<00:01:33.890> nine-millimeter<00:01:37.340> you<00:01:38.340> can<00:01:38.460> use<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.670> same

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
or nine-millimeter you can use the same

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.080 
or nine-millimeter you can use the same
magazine<00:01:39.350> it<00:01:40.350> worked<00:01:40.500> pretty<00:01:40.680> well

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090

one<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.140> most<00:01:43.229> common<00:01:43.649> things<00:01:43.890> you'll

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
one of the most common things you'll

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.330 
one of the most common things you'll
hear<00:01:44.220> about<00:01:44.520> these<00:01:44.789> is<00:01:45.149> these<00:01:46.039> firing<00:01:47.039> pins

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
hear about these is these firing pins

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.679 
hear about these is these firing pins
the<00:01:48.299> caution<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.619> not<00:01:50.509> dry<00:01:51.509> fire<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:52.409> gun

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
the caution is to not dry fire this gun

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.550 
the caution is to not dry fire this gun
because<00:01:54.689> these<00:01:56.720> original<00:01:57.720> equipment<00:01:57.960> firing

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
because these original equipment firing

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.039 
because these original equipment firing
pins<00:01:58.860> are<00:01:59.959> cast-iron<00:02:00.959> and<00:02:02.299> you<00:02:03.299> just<00:02:03.390> break

pins are cast-iron and you just break

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:10.270 
pins are cast-iron and you just break
them<00:02:04.200> off<00:02:04.350> by<00:02:04.909> firing<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.119> this<00:02:06.299> one<00:02:06.479> has<00:02:06.659> a

aftermarket firing pin to get the firing
pin<00:02:14.519> out<00:02:14.670> you're<00:02:14.849> just<00:02:15.030> taking<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.569> same<00:02:15.780> tool

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
pin out you're just taking the same tool

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
release the firing pin out this

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.229 
release the firing pin out this
particular<00:02:24.269> firing<00:02:24.690> pin<00:02:24.930> is

spring-loaded

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.449 

and<00:02:32.180> that's

aftermarket firing pin you can see the

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.770 
aftermarket firing pin you can see the
difference<00:02:41.099> in<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.340> aftermarket<00:02:41.879> one<00:02:42.239> versus

that's<00:03:14.069> made<00:03:15.349> 1952-53

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.160 
that's made 1952-53
era<00:03:18.620> and<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.680> firing<00:03:19.950> pin<00:03:20.189> stop<00:03:20.489> in<00:03:20.730> it<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.900> stop

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
era and a firing pin stop in it the stop

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.559 
era and a firing pin stop in it the stop
holds<00:03:22.499> the<00:03:22.560> firing<00:03:22.859> pin<00:03:23.040> in<00:03:23.159> the<00:03:23.340> pistol<00:03:24.329> but

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
holds the firing pin in the pistol but

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.520 
holds the firing pin in the pistol but
it<00:03:25.430> also<00:03:26.430> which<00:03:26.790> works<00:03:27.030> like<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.299> modern<00:03:28.170> firing

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
it also which works like a modern firing

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.459 
it also which works like a modern firing
pin<00:03:28.739> stuff<00:03:29.040> that<00:03:29.250> you'll<00:03:29.459> see<00:03:30.230> go<00:03:31.230> ahead<00:03:31.379> and

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:31.469 
pin stuff that you'll see go ahead and

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:32.869 
pin stuff that you'll see go ahead and
put<00:03:31.560> this<00:03:31.680> back<00:03:31.889> together<00:03:32.099> and<00:03:32.489> this<00:03:32.639> is<00:03:32.700> the

put this back together and this is the

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.679 
put this back together and this is the
one<00:03:33.120> tricky<00:03:33.840> part<00:03:34.049> about<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.409> whole<00:03:35.689> assembly
