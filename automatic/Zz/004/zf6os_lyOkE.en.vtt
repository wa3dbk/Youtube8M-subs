it off we'll turn this by taking the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.539 
it off we'll turn this by taking the
edge<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.320> just<00:01:10.560> cutting<00:01:10.770> along<00:01:11.100> the

copyright material now you need to

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.399 
copyright material now you need to
determine<00:01:14.970> which<00:01:15.479> piece<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.930> fabric<00:01:16.110> is

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
determine which piece of fabric is

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.200 
determine which piece of fabric is
larger<00:01:16.860> because<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.430> want<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.670> larger<00:01:18.030> piece

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
larger because you want the larger piece

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.480 
larger because you want the larger piece
on<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.539> bottom<00:01:18.690> in<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.770> case<00:01:20.039> the<00:01:20.250> print

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
on the bottom in this case the print

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.190 
on the bottom in this case the print
fabric<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.970> larger<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.509> I'll<00:01:21.750> flip<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
fabric is larger so I'll flip the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.740 
fabric is larger so I'll flip the
project<00:01:22.619> over<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.460> cut<00:01:23.700> along<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.390> larger

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
project over to cut along the larger

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.050 
project over to cut along the larger
piece<00:01:25.070> now<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.130> need<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.490> cut<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.880> larger

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
piece now you need to cut the larger

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.910 
piece now you need to cut the larger
fabric<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.869> match<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.229> same<00:01:28.380> size<00:01:28.649> of<00:01:28.770> the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
fabric to match the same size of the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:53.640 
fabric to match the same size of the
smaller<00:01:29.190> fabric

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.990 

now<00:01:54.650> you<00:01:54.710> need<00:01:54.950> to<00:01:55.010> determine<00:01:55.370> whether<00:01:55.760> you

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
now you need to determine whether you

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.610 
now you need to determine whether you
want<00:01:56.150> to<00:01:56.240> flip<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.600> piece<00:01:56.780> back<00:01:56.960> over<00:01:57.350> to<00:01:57.470> the

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
want to flip the piece back over to the

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.740 
want to flip the piece back over to the
front<00:01:57.980> side<00:01:58.220> or<00:01:58.790> leave<00:01:58.940> it<00:01:59.060> on<00:01:59.120> the<00:01:59.270> solid<00:01:59.600> side
