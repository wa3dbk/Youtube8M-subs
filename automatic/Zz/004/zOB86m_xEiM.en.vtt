now what you can do with free lensing is

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.830 
now what you can do with free lensing is
you<00:01:04.379> can<00:01:04.619> tilt<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.900> image<00:01:08.060> you<00:01:09.060> took<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.630> lens

the right side of it and in the middle

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.149 
the right side of it and in the middle
of<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.689> set<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.290> frame<00:01:19.619> I'm<00:01:19.890> still

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
of the set of the frame I'm still

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.969 
of the set of the frame I'm still
focused<00:01:20.640> on<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.850> front<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> lens<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.320> be

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
focused on the front of the lens so be

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.149 
focused on the front of the lens so be
literally<00:01:23.280> sort<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.170> twisted<00:01:25.170> sort<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.860> turned

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
literally sort of twisted sort of turned

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.780 
literally sort of twisted sort of turned
the<00:01:26.869> focal<00:01:27.869> plane<00:01:27.960> sideways<00:01:28.680> sort<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.520> on<00:01:29.640> its

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
the focal plane sideways sort of on its

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.810 
the focal plane sideways sort of on its
side<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.650> if<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.799> imagine<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.310> visit<00:01:32.640> an

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
side so if you imagine and visit an

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.810 
side so if you imagine and visit an
invisible<00:01:33.360> line<00:01:33.560> of<00:01:34.560> an<00:01:34.890> area<00:01:35.189> where<00:01:35.430> it's<00:01:35.700> in

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
invisible line of an area where it's in

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.050 
invisible line of an area where it's in
focus<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.930> line<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.439> now<00:01:37.680> on<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.130> left<00:01:38.369> it's

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
focus that line is now on the left it's

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.520 
focus that line is now on the left it's
much<00:01:39.270> closer<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.750> me<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.049> on<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.229> right<00:01:40.380> it's

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
much closer to me and on the right it's

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.030 
much closer to me and on the right it's
much<00:01:40.680> further<00:01:40.979> away<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:42.860> along<00:01:43.860> with<00:01:43.890> that

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
much further away so along with that

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.620 
much further away so along with that
this<00:01:44.520> lens<00:01:44.729> gives<00:01:45.590> you<00:01:46.590> no<00:01:46.710> really<00:01:47.630> beautiful

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
little bit bent so if you took a an

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.410

the<00:03:33.540> frame<00:03:33.750> won't<00:03:34.019> be<00:03:34.110> in<00:03:34.200> focus<00:03:34.560> so<00:03:35.690> it's

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
the frame won't be in focus so it's

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.460
