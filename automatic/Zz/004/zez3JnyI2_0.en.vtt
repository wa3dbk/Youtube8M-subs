and what you want to do is have 0 1 year

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.380 
and what you want to do is have 0 1 year
friends<00:00:56.150> go<00:00:56.930> to<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.409> open<00:00:58.040> the<00:00:58.189> doors<00:00:58.430> area

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
friends go to the open the doors area

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.130 
friends go to the open the doors area
and<00:00:59.689> one<00:01:00.290> of<00:01:00.379> your<00:01:00.500> friends<00:01:00.739> go<00:01:01.070> to<00:01:01.100> the<00:01:01.369> timer

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
and one of your friends go to the timer

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.719 
and one of your friends go to the timer
once<00:01:03.140> you<00:01:03.260> have<00:01:03.290> both<00:01:03.530> friends<00:01:03.920> there<00:01:04.129> when

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
once you have both friends there when

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.330 
once you have both friends there when
the<00:01:04.939> thing<00:01:05.449> hits<00:01:05.659> zero<00:01:05.990> tell<00:01:06.830> your<00:01:06.979> friend<00:01:07.250> to

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
the thing hits zero tell your friend to

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.520 
the thing hits zero tell your friend to
immediately<00:01:07.880> open<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.330> door<00:01:08.540> and<00:01:08.780> it's<00:01:09.409> done

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
immediately open the door and it's done

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.039 
immediately open the door and it's done
correctly<00:01:09.740> this<00:01:10.340> part<00:01:10.970> may<00:01:11.240> be<00:01:11.299> difficult<00:01:11.630> and

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
correctly this part may be difficult and

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.200 
correctly this part may be difficult and
if<00:01:12.979> you're<00:01:13.250> doing<00:01:13.460> this<00:01:13.549> for<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:13.820> first<00:01:13.850> time

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
if you're doing this for the first time

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.359 
if you're doing this for the first time
I'd<00:01:14.659> recommend<00:01:15.140> waiting<00:01:15.860> a<00:01:16.130> little<00:01:16.250> bit

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
I'd recommend waiting a little bit

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.249 
I'd recommend waiting a little bit
longer<00:01:16.610> because<00:01:17.299> if<00:01:17.540> you<00:01:17.600> do<00:01:17.720> open<00:01:17.990> it<00:01:18.140> too

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
longer because if you do open it too

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:19.539 
longer because if you do open it too
early<00:01:18.290> you're<00:01:18.740> gonna<00:01:18.890> have<00:01:19.040> to<00:01:19.189> restart<00:01:19.490> the

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
early you're gonna have to restart the

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.330 
early you're gonna have to restart the
game<00:01:19.790> but<00:01:20.630> if<00:01:20.720> you<00:01:20.840> did<00:01:20.990> do<00:01:21.079> it<00:01:21.110> correctly<00:01:21.439> the

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
game but if you did do it correctly the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.890 
game but if you did do it correctly the
elevator<00:01:22.700> should<00:01:22.909> go<00:01:23.090> up<00:01:23.240> and<00:01:23.510> you<00:01:23.690> should

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
elevator should go up and you should

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.170 
elevator should go up and you should
open<00:01:24.230> the<00:01:24.320> door<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:24.740> you<00:01:25.670> should<00:01:25.850> be<00:01:25.940> on<00:01:26.030> an

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
open the door and you should be on an

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.899 
open the door and you should be on an
invisible<00:01:26.659> barrier<00:01:26.690> and<00:01:27.530> it<00:01:27.920> is<00:01:28.070> pretty<00:01:28.670> much

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
invisible barrier and it is pretty much

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.160 
invisible barrier and it is pretty much
self-explanatory<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:30.530> it<00:01:30.800> is<00:01:30.920> a<00:01:30.950> glitch<00:01:31.340> and

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
self-explanatory and it is a glitch and

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.210 
self-explanatory and it is a glitch and
if<00:01:33.170> you<00:01:33.290> want<00:01:33.470> to<00:01:33.530> actually<00:01:33.620> make<00:01:33.920> some<00:01:34.070> use

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
if you want to actually make some use

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.580 
if you want to actually make some use
out<00:01:34.370> of<00:01:34.430> it<00:01:34.670> I<00:01:34.880> would<00:01:35.600> recommend<00:01:36.080> making<00:01:36.350> the

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
out of it I would recommend making the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.649 
out of it I would recommend making the
right<00:01:36.740> chill<00:01:36.979> to<00:01:37.130> give<00:01:37.280> me<00:01:37.370> Claymore<00:01:37.850> and<00:01:38.450> then

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
right chill to give me Claymore and then

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.290 
right chill to give me Claymore and then
getting<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.110> host<00:01:39.320> player<00:01:39.650> to<00:01:40.070> go<00:01:40.220> to<00:01:41.150> the

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
getting the host player to go to the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.480 
getting the host player to go to the
right<00:01:41.540> of<00:01:41.720> the<00:01:41.750> door<00:01:41.990> and<00:01:42.260> then<00:01:42.979> going<00:01:43.190> numb

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
right of the door and then going numb

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.719 
right of the door and then going numb
prone<00:01:44.180> or<00:01:44.210> crouched<00:01:44.870> and<00:01:45.430> getting<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:46.520> claim

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
prone or crouched and getting the claim

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.760 
prone or crouched and getting the claim
were<00:01:46.909> looking<00:01:47.300> down<00:01:47.510> and<00:01:48.200> what<00:01:48.350> that<00:01:48.500> will<00:01:48.620> do

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
were looking down and what that will do

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.810 
were looking down and what that will do
is<00:01:48.799> I'm<00:01:49.190> is<00:01:49.460> cause<00:01:50.330> a<00:01:50.360> up<00:01:51.080> god<00:01:51.979> mode<00:01:52.220> glitch<00:01:52.250> and

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
is I'm is cause a up god mode glitch and

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.610 
is I'm is cause a up god mode glitch and
the<00:01:53.360> zombies<00:01:53.510> won't<00:01:53.900> be<00:01:54.020> able<00:01:54.140> to<00:01:54.320> hit<00:01:54.470> them

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
the zombies won't be able to hit them

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.960 
the zombies won't be able to hit them
and<00:01:55.090> it's<00:01:56.090> pretty<00:01:56.299> cool<00:01:56.570> and<00:01:57.250> if<00:01:58.250> you<00:01:58.549> are<00:01:58.729> in

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
and it's pretty cool and if you are in

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.420 
and it's pretty cool and if you are in
the<00:01:59.120> pillars<00:01:59.540> inside<00:01:59.990> this<00:02:00.110> room<00:02:00.350> no<00:02:01.010> zombies

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
the pillars inside this room no zombies

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.120 
the pillars inside this room no zombies
can<00:02:01.610> hurt<00:02:01.820> you<00:02:02.000> and<00:02:02.270> it<00:02:03.140> it's<00:02:03.619> a<00:02:03.740> pretty<00:02:03.890> cool

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
can hurt you and it it's a pretty cool

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.130 
can hurt you and it it's a pretty cool
glitch<00:02:04.369> I<00:02:04.700> would<00:02:05.240> say<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.600> timing<00:02:05.869> is

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
glitch I would say the timing is

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.870 
glitch I would say the timing is
probably<00:02:06.619> the<00:02:06.830> most<00:02:07.040> difficult<00:02:07.280> part<00:02:07.640> about

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
probably the most difficult part about

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.699 
probably the most difficult part about
this<00:02:08.119> glitch<00:02:08.390> but<00:02:09.019> once<00:02:09.170> you<00:02:09.289> get<00:02:09.379> it<00:02:09.530> down<00:02:09.560> you

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
this glitch but once you get it down you

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.640 
this glitch but once you get it down you
should<00:02:10.190> be<00:02:10.310> able<00:02:10.399> to<00:02:10.549> do<00:02:10.640> every<00:02:10.909> other<00:02:10.940> game<00:02:11.650> so

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
should be able to do every other game so

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.220 
should be able to do every other game so
be<00:02:13.010> very<00:02:13.190> much<00:02:13.430> appreciated<00:02:13.810> if<00:02:14.810> this<00:02:14.989> video

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
be very much appreciated if this video
