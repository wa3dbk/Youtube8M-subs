to<00:00:33.000> access<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.570> but<00:00:33.660> usually<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.170> software's

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
to access it but usually the software's

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.810 
to access it but usually the software's
either<00:00:34.800> on<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.100> card<00:00:35.370> or<00:00:35.550> it's<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:35.730> the

so but this has been in my computer many

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.299 
so but this has been in my computer many
times<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.379> software<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.860> there<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.160> what<00:00:41.219> I

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
times so the software is there so what I

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.360 
times so the software is there so what I
do<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.850> plug<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:43.040> and<00:00:44.040> then<00:00:44.160> you'll<00:00:44.280> see

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
do is I I plug it in and then you'll see

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.549 
do is I I plug it in and then you'll see
a<00:00:44.489> little<00:00:44.789> beep<00:00:45.000> my<00:00:45.690> system<00:00:46.110> just<00:00:46.320> let<00:00:46.440> me<00:00:46.530> know

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
a little beep my system just let me know

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.560

little<00:01:38.970> thumb<00:01:39.150> drives<00:01:39.390> they<00:01:39.570> might<00:01:39.750> blink<00:01:40.020> or

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
little thumb drives they might blink or

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.819 
little thumb drives they might blink or
something<00:01:40.409> let<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.560> know<00:01:40.650> they're<00:01:40.770> working

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
something let you know they're working

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
so that's the save part but you can't

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.370 
so that's the save part but you can't
just<00:01:43.530> go<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:44.220> remove<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.960> right<00:01:45.960> away

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
just go and remove it right away

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.700 
just go and remove it right away
you<00:01:46.649> still<00:01:46.979> have<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.460> let<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.820> drive<00:01:48.030> be

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
you still have to let the drive be

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.460 
you still have to let the drive be
basically<00:01:49.710> unmounted<00:01:50.460> correctly<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.470> some
