I<00:01:08.619> made<00:01:08.920> this<00:01:09.159> wet<00:01:09.880> bath<00:01:25.440> because<00:01:26.940> you<00:01:27.940> don't

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
I made this wet bath because you don't

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.699 
I made this wet bath because you don't
want<00:01:28.240> that<00:01:28.360> desk<00:01:28.860> clouding<00:01:29.860> up<00:01:29.979> the<00:01:30.159> fish<00:01:30.369> tank

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:35.520 
want that desk clouding up the fish tank
eventually<00:01:32.709> it<00:01:32.770> will<00:01:32.830> probably<00:01:33.369> sell<00:01:33.640> out<00:01:34.530> but

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:33.939 
repeat over and over again until I fell

00:02:33.939 --> 00:03:24.580 
repeat over and over again until I fell
off<00:02:33.970> my<00:02:34.090> bed

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.759 

all<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.860> media<00:03:26.159> is<00:03:26.280> now<00:03:26.640> in<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.150> grill<00:03:27.390> bed

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
all the media is now in the grill bed

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.170 
all the media is now in the grill bed
and<00:03:28.769> as<00:03:29.640> you<00:03:29.760> can<00:03:29.940> see<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.510> system<00:03:30.810> is<00:03:31.140> running

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
and as you can see the system is running

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.699 
and as you can see the system is running
it's<00:03:33.180> actually<00:03:33.450> running<00:03:33.629> nice<00:03:33.989> and<00:03:34.260> quietly

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
it's actually running nice and quietly

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:41.420 
it's actually running nice and quietly
which<00:03:35.190> makes<00:03:36.000> me<00:03:36.209> very<00:03:36.360> happy<00:03:36.599> I<00:03:40.280> guess<00:03:41.280> I

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
which makes me very happy I guess I

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.220 
which makes me very happy I guess I
underestimated<00:03:41.700> how<00:03:42.360> much<00:03:42.390> media<00:03:42.989> would<00:03:43.110> go

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
underestimated how much media would go

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.520 
underestimated how much media would go
in<00:03:43.319> the<00:03:43.440> grow<00:03:43.650> bed<00:03:43.829> we<00:03:44.040> did<00:03:44.220> 100<00:03:44.700> litres<00:03:45.530> we

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
in the grow bed we did 100 litres we

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.500 
in the grow bed we did 100 litres we
probably<00:03:46.799> needed<00:03:47.099> more<00:03:47.400> like<00:03:48.230> 113<00:03:49.230> liters<00:03:50.510> so

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
probably needed more like 113 liters so

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.350 
probably needed more like 113 liters so
that's<00:03:51.690> okay<00:03:52.370> if<00:03:53.370> I<00:03:53.519> really<00:03:53.790> need<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.120> like

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
that's okay if I really need to like

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.800 
that's okay if I really need to like
instead<00:03:54.780> some<00:03:55.019> gravel<00:03:55.470> on<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.650> bottom<00:03:56.810> at

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
instead some gravel on the bottom at

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.860 
instead some gravel on the bottom at
some<00:03:58.079> point<00:03:58.819> but<00:03:59.819> it's<00:03:59.970> nice<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:00.359> quiet<00:04:00.480> which

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
some point but it's nice and quiet which

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.309 
some point but it's nice and quiet which
is<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.140> most<00:04:01.319> important<00:04:01.829> thing<00:04:01.980> because

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
is the most important thing because

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.430 
is the most important thing because
that's<00:04:04.319> my<00:04:04.560> hallway<00:04:04.859> right<00:04:05.310> here<00:04:06.319> which<00:04:07.319> you

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
that's my hallway right here which you

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.569 
that's my hallway right here which you
can<00:04:07.590> see<00:04:07.620> is<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.250> stairwell<00:04:09.530> so<00:04:10.530> I<00:04:10.859> don't<00:04:11.430> want

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
can see is the stairwell so I don't want

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.410 
can see is the stairwell so I don't want
people<00:04:12.560> walking<00:04:13.560> by<00:04:13.769> and<00:04:14.220> saying<00:04:14.879> oh<00:04:15.090> my<00:04:15.239> god

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
people walking by and saying oh my god

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.830 
people walking by and saying oh my god
something's<00:04:15.750> flooding<00:04:16.380> in<00:04:16.500> there<00:04:17.209> so<00:04:18.209> we<00:04:18.750> are

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
something's flooding in there so we are

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.310 
something's flooding in there so we are
nice<00:04:19.109> and<00:04:19.380> quiet<00:04:20.389> even<00:04:21.389> the<00:04:21.510> siphon<00:04:21.930> is<00:04:22.079> pretty

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
nice and quiet even the siphon is pretty

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.850 
nice and quiet even the siphon is pretty
quiet<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.949> loops<00:04:23.160> i<00:04:23.340> think<00:04:23.580> is<00:04:23.669> pretty<00:04:23.850> quiet

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
quiet the loops i think is pretty quiet

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.529 
quiet the loops i think is pretty quiet
take<00:04:25.860> a<00:04:25.889> look<00:04:26.100> at<00:04:26.190> that<00:04:28.820> as<00:04:29.820> you<00:04:29.910> can<00:04:30.120> see<00:04:30.180> the

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
take a look at that as you can see the

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:33.830 
take a look at that as you can see the
siphon<00:04:30.930> is<00:04:31.050> just<00:04:31.320> starting<00:04:31.740> now<00:04:32.720> it<00:04:33.720> only

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
siphon is just starting now it only

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.710 
siphon is just starting now it only
takes<00:04:34.260> a<00:04:34.530> few<00:04:34.710> seconds<00:04:35.370> for<00:04:35.550> it<00:04:35.729> to<00:04:35.820> get<00:04:36.180> going

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
takes a few seconds for it to get going

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.180 
takes a few seconds for it to get going
fully

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.920 

and<00:04:43.449> here<00:04:44.449> comes<00:04:46.060> all<00:04:47.060> right<00:04:47.180> so<00:04:47.449> the<00:04:47.570> siphon

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
and here comes all right so the siphon

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.219 
and here comes all right so the siphon
is<00:04:47.990> going<00:04:48.230> fully<00:04:49.150> tell<00:04:50.150> you<00:04:50.270> can<00:04:50.419> see<00:04:50.630> my<00:04:50.900> tank

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229 
is going fully tell you can see my tank

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.150 
is going fully tell you can see my tank
as<00:04:52.240> gone<00:04:53.240> down<00:04:53.419> by<00:04:53.600> about<00:04:53.720> a<00:04:53.870> third<00:04:54.139> and<00:04:55.040> I

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
as gone down by about a third and I

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.640 
as gone down by about a third and I
think<00:04:55.400> that<00:04:56.210> should<00:04:56.449> be<00:04:56.479> OK<00:04:57.020> for<00:04:57.080> the<00:04:57.440> fish

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
think that should be OK for the fish

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.200 
think that should be OK for the fish
didn't<00:04:58.430> stress<00:04:58.699> them<00:04:58.880> out<00:04:59.000> too<00:04:59.240> much<00:05:01.210> that's

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
didn't stress them out too much that's

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.080 
didn't stress them out too much that's
it<00:05:02.540> our<00:05:02.750> media's<00:05:03.229> in<00:05:03.530> here<00:05:04.040> and<00:05:04.220> now<00:05:04.940> we're

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
it our media's in here and now we're

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.219 
it our media's in here and now we're
ready<00:05:05.270> to<00:05:05.570> take<00:05:05.750> the<00:05:06.020> next<00:05:06.380> step<00:05:06.639> which<00:05:07.639> is

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
ready to take the next step which is

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:11.620 
ready to take the next step which is
dealing<00:05:09.229> with<00:05:09.410> this<00:05:09.680> stuff<00:05:10.150> the<00:05:11.150> water<00:05:11.389> we

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
dealing with this stuff the water we

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.270 
dealing with this stuff the water we
need<00:05:11.810> to<00:05:11.900> get<00:05:12.020> some<00:05:12.199> nutrients<00:05:12.650> in<00:05:12.889> there<00:05:13.070> so

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
need to get some nutrients in there so

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.969 
need to get some nutrients in there so
we<00:05:13.400> can<00:05:13.780> grow<00:05:14.780> some<00:05:14.810> plants<00:05:17.260> so<00:05:18.260> the<00:05:18.740> next

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
we can grow some plants so the next

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.879 
we can grow some plants so the next
series<00:05:19.370> of<00:05:19.400> videos<00:05:19.550> is<00:05:20.150> going<00:05:20.780> to<00:05:21.080> be<00:05:21.290> about

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
series of videos is going to be about

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.659 
series of videos is going to be about
what<00:05:22.790> we<00:05:22.910> call<00:05:23.120> cycling<00:05:23.810> the<00:05:24.020> system<00:05:24.470> and<00:05:25.190> that

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
what we call cycling the system and that

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:29.010 
what we call cycling the system and that
is<00:05:25.880> building<00:05:26.270> up<00:05:26.450> the<00:05:26.780> back<00:05:27.440> here<00:05:27.740> of<00:05:27.770> colony

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
is building up the back here of colony

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.610 
is building up the back here of colony
in<00:05:30.020> your<00:05:30.290> grow<00:05:30.470> bed<00:05:30.500> and<00:05:30.950> fish<00:05:31.130> tank<00:05:31.570> so<00:05:32.570> that

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
in your grow bed and fish tank so that

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.830 
in your grow bed and fish tank so that
you're<00:05:33.620> having<00:05:33.979> the<00:05:34.310> nutrients<00:05:35.000> be<00:05:35.419> produced

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
you're having the nutrients be produced

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.980 
you're having the nutrients be produced
by<00:05:36.050> those<00:05:36.200> bacteria<00:05:36.860> and<00:05:37.570> then<00:05:38.570> the<00:05:38.690> plants

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
by those bacteria and then the plants

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.150 
by those bacteria and then the plants
can<00:05:39.110> grow<00:05:40.630> so<00:05:41.630> that's<00:05:42.530> it<00:05:42.710> for<00:05:42.860> this<00:05:42.949> time

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
can grow so that's it for this time

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.190 
can grow so that's it for this time
