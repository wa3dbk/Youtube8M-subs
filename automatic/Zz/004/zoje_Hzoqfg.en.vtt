 fresh air and nature but how to be 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.609
 if we look at the plot but not at home 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.010
 build it with 0 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.390
 how do you see your country house and 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.550
 what offers current trends 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.060
 construction try to understand 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.060
 Today 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:37.090
 hello alexander how are you 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.680
 would get some dacha business here 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.960
 looking to build a house need a family 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.730
 big need to expand so how much do u 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.180
 you children 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.620
 604 children how long do you need 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.000
 roomy good warm 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.500
 the main thing is probably eco-friendly after all 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.200
 achieve some requirements for he 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.450
 criterion well, it can be of course if 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.670
 there were such materials it was possible 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.290
 build not plant lies as it were 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.090
 save then I think such a pain who does not 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.059
 refused well what too some basting 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.770
 There is what material you this shock Yes think 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.110
 that there is no because they are on the market 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.670
 the amount that you do not immediately choose how 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.409
 look at the fact that the experts you 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.909
 helped in this question but I thought that 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.470
 anybody would be very good it would be interesting 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.600
 listen and see now how 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.250
 times and go to us gypsy this news 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.110
 choose suitable material for home 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.180
 professionals arrived not empty-handed 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.770
 since always when building housing 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.320
 preference was given to natural 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.420
 materials wood stone and brick for 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.860
 alexander did not bring arbolit woody 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.870
 Python meets quality standards 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.270
 has good sound insulation 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.580
 energy efficient environmentally friendly and 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.560
 durable material for durability 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.240
 It belongs to the fifth group, that is, it does not 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.870
 affected by the microflora of the fungus and 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.760
 mold 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.830
 according to the experts of drigo blocks 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.780
 possesses good frost resistance in 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.400
 early sixties were used 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.710
 in the construction of additional buildings 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.990
 polar station well so sitting in conditions 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.180
 dry climate wall thickness was 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.100
 only 30 centimeters more than that 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.390
 builders claims arbolit on fire not 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.520
 burns and does not sink in water 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.920
 we tested it during the experiments 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.820
 for that, let's get acquainted first 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.740
 Alexander is Andrei 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.000
 consultant specialist who will tell 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.830
 us about new material 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.860
 and this is alexander he plans to build 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.080
 big house not four children therefore 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.370
 he has a lot of material requirements 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.810
 Tell me what kind of subject 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.940
 can use construction 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.900
 but as you can see this block is a block 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.200
 called arbolit or wood concrete 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.379
 actually consists of 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.239
 natural material is tweaking and 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:33.069
 respectively with cement how can you 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.409
 be durable if it just tweaks 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.620
 cement due to this in fact and 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:41.860
 durable ie wood chips binds the material 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.870
 that is, how fittings are enough 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.330
 the strength that even it is possible 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.580
 the overlap lay down a raccoon is very interesting 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.920
 say that strong good distemper 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.690
 return as it should be checked probably on 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.280
 but actually, in fact, we can just 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.470
 try to hammer a nail that's right a 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:04.230
 then try to pull him out of it 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:07.540
 let's try interesting wheels 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.400
 available is very easy to say that 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.830
 as if i think it can even be his 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.080
 raise one nail well yes indeed 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.970
 firmly seated on be it is a brick of course 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.970
 you can not drive you though you can try 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.330
 I'm still starting to crumble here 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.760
 you can do not only will score 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.830
 not to say that it is easy enough to saw 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.810
 that is, you can make any arches out of it 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.030
 any designs that you like yes 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.950
 very interesting judging because more 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:44.140
 hands do not pull there does not look like he 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:45.660
 will the truth come in ease 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.550
 the saw is not very similar to ordinary 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.680
 hay actually she's easy 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.959
 ignites surely own and 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.470
 this arbolit yes this block y also also 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.250
 learn more treat composition 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.380
 certain that counteracts 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.420
 burning 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.070
 and the spread of all sorts of different 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.480
 microorganisms when let's try 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.480
 set fire to give of course 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.010
 playkasta 15 minutes on an open fire he 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.660
 only slightly black yes of course 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.150
 Imagine what happens if 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.760
 Savostina there is a maximum there so here 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.340
 a little bit darker these increasingly here we are 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.110
 conducted an experiment with how do you think you 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.810
 and your family is such a material and build 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.850
 monster's body because it's better once 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.560
 see clearly how it all goes 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.930
 but who buy material which 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.580
 advertising a lot of incomprehensible how through what 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.100
 thanks made brazil 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.870
 depending on the brand arbolit can 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.010
 use when building two three 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.270
 storey residential buildings 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.890
 as well as production 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.610
 agricultural and warehouse 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.410
 premises 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.240
 application tree industrial 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.280
 The scale began in the 50s 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.860
 last century also this stuff 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.960
 known and applied abroad 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.590
 Switzerland usa Czech Republic Japan and Germany and 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.720
 austria 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.610
 Now demagogue is considered one of the most 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.260
 economical construction materials 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.960
 construction of a crossbow is essential 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:18.290
 reduces carrier construction costs 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.060
 designs as with the thickness of the stylish 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:23.690
 30 centimeters which is quite enough 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.480
 for thermal insulation in our region 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.100
 the cost of construction is reduced 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:32.660
 approximately 25 percent by 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:34.130
 compared to brick and foam now 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.930
 add make mostly in 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.580
 Moscow region at the present time 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.110
 I am setting up production of the 3rd unit in 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.480
 large rural area of ​​our region 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.760
 after a couple of months Yaroslav there 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.800
 tree python will become more accessible 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.330
 He has an idea to use arbolit for 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.680
 house construction unit 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:55.330
 dilapidated and emergency 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:55.330
 I'm building
