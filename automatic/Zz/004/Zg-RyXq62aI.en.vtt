00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
this is Audi's all-new s4 it may not

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.889 
this is Audi's all-new s4 it may not
look<00:00:05.580> all<00:00:05.790> that<00:00:05.879> different<00:00:05.940> on<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:06.450> outside

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
look all that different on the outside

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.629 
look all that different on the outside
but<00:00:07.319> it's<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.560> bits<00:00:07.770> underneath<00:00:08.280> that<00:00:08.460> make

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
but it's the bits underneath that make

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.549 
but it's the bits underneath that make
this<00:00:08.820> car<00:00:09.059> so<00:00:09.330> radically<00:00:09.870> different<00:00:09.900> from<00:00:10.290> its

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
this car so radically different from its

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.560 
this car so radically different from its
predecessor<00:00:11.160> LD<00:00:12.030> have<00:00:12.090> scrapped<00:00:12.420> the

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
predecessor LD have scrapped the

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.629 
predecessor LD have scrapped the
burbling<00:00:12.900> v8<00:00:13.259> engine<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:13.889> replaced<00:00:14.219> it<00:00:14.610> with

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
burbling v8 engine and replaced it with

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.109 
burbling v8 engine and replaced it with
a<00:00:14.759> smaller<00:00:15.059> three<00:00:15.480> litre<00:00:15.690> v6<00:00:19.730> and<00:00:20.730> that's<00:00:20.910> no

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
a smaller three litre v6 and that's no

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.240 
a smaller three litre v6 and that's no
bad<00:00:21.359> thing<00:00:21.420> because<00:00:21.900> it's<00:00:22.199> been<00:00:22.380> supercharged

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
bad thing because it's been supercharged

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.580 
bad thing because it's been supercharged
which<00:00:23.609> means<00:00:23.850> it's<00:00:23.970> producing<00:00:24.449> 330<00:00:25.289> brake

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
which means it's producing 330 brake

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.439 
which means it's producing 330 brake
horsepower<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.369> that's<00:00:26.580> good<00:00:26.880> for<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.300> nought

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
horsepower and that's good for a nought

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.810 
horsepower and that's good for a nought
to<00:00:27.570> sixty<00:00:27.900> time<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.320> 5.1<00:00:28.980> seconds<00:00:29.460> which<00:00:29.789> is

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
to sixty time of 5.1 seconds which is

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.060 
to sixty time of 5.1 seconds which is
actually<00:00:30.240> faster<00:00:30.689> than<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.199> old<00:00:31.349> model<00:00:31.560> plus

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
actually faster than the old model plus

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.770 
actually faster than the old model plus
because<00:00:32.430> it's<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.610> smaller<00:00:32.880> engine<00:00:33.329> it

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
because it's a smaller engine it

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:48.049 
because it's a smaller engine it
actually<00:00:34.110> uses<00:00:34.320> less<00:00:34.440> fuel

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.549 

now<00:00:49.059> you<00:00:49.120> can<00:00:49.420> also<00:00:49.570> have<00:00:49.690> your<00:00:49.870> s4<00:00:50.289> with<00:00:50.409> some

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
now you can also have your s4 with some

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.349 
now you can also have your s4 with some
really<00:00:50.739> quite<00:00:51.280> clever<00:00:51.519> electronic<00:00:52.239> gadgetry

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359 
really quite clever electronic gadgetry

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:54.479 
really quite clever electronic gadgetry
like<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:52.870> new<00:00:53.019> active<00:00:53.500> sports<00:00:53.800> differential

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
like the new active sports differential

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.490 
like the new active sports differential
and<00:00:54.909> what<00:00:55.059> that<00:00:55.210> does<00:00:55.390> is<00:00:55.629> it<00:00:55.719> sends<00:00:55.899> power<00:00:56.170> to

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
and what that does is it sends power to

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.139 
and what that does is it sends power to
the<00:00:56.620> outer<00:00:56.800> rear<00:00:57.219> wheel<00:00:57.429> in<00:00:57.609> the<00:00:57.699> cars<00:00:57.909> under

hard<00:00:58.329> acceleration<00:00:58.420> through<00:00:59.379> a<00:00:59.500> corner<00:00:59.890> which

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
hard acceleration through a corner which

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.099 
hard acceleration through a corner which
maximizes<00:01:01.059> traction<00:01:01.570> and<00:01:01.659> grip<00:01:01.750> and

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
maximizes traction and grip and

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.350 
maximizes traction and grip and
minimizes<00:01:02.710> understeer<00:01:03.250> and<00:01:03.370> oversteer<00:01:03.489> it's
