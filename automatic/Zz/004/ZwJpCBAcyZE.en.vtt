it's hard to get in and out of the bike
but<00:01:51.830> not<00:01:52.069> really<00:01:52.280> to<00:01:52.610> get<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:52.970> battery<00:01:53.240> out

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
but not really to get the battery out

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.850

all you have to do is open the

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.309 
all you have to do is open the
quick-release<00:01:55.039> and<00:01:55.520> then<00:01:55.700> slide<00:01:56.119> it<00:01:56.270> up<00:01:56.420> tap

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
quick-release and then slide it up tap

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:59.020 
quick-release and then slide it up tap
it<00:01:57.500> forward<00:01:57.830> and<00:01:57.979> there<00:01:58.490> you<00:01:58.580> go<00:01:58.789> you're

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
it forward and there you go you're

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.910 
it forward and there you go you're
released<00:01:59.360> it<00:01:59.569> from<00:01:59.750> the<00:01:59.899> bike<00:02:00.110> so<00:02:00.530> it's<00:02:00.679> a<00:02:00.770> real

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
released it from the bike so it's a real

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.469 
released it from the bike so it's a real
simple<00:02:01.160> system<00:02:01.640> actually<00:02:01.789> and<00:02:02.179> it<00:02:02.330> works

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479
