00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.630

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.850
 very talented groups that have had 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.020

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.820

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.770

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.460

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.369
 in the park of san pedro 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.590
 and we are very happy there was no need 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.650
 open with this album and today 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.050
 we bring everything a bigger production 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.659
 what content we normally do with 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.850
 long time and a lot of love the order of 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.860
 the songs all all everything is fine 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.680
 planned come very happy because it's worth 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.890
 it's worth it so I think it's the best 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.320
 show that through seven years that we 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.670
 has come to see the concerts in 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.220
 places because they told us about it 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.009
 will teach some songs more we 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.149
 consult noa and we loved the roll that 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.350
 has that month is that the people who 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:45.740
 enjoy our music you will enjoy 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.740
 of the night 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.960
 I dont know 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.850
 our new single I believe in you 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.450
 we premiered the video this Friday in 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.820
 internet and starts to rotate from 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.909
 next monday 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.560
 and we are happy because because it is 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.990
 a song that excites us a lot 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.640
 sharing is a video that we recorded in a 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.039
 live format as if they were a blog 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.380
 because as it is a nation before and it 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.750
 try giving from feelings 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.370
 I think it's transmitted much more live 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.680
 what engraved 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.319
 our made a good idea to do it 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.819
 in that concept besides that in addition to 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.920
 record it in Spanish we recorded it in 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.840
 English in Portuguese in Italian 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.010
 so the video comes out simultaneously in 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.010
 all those languages 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.720
 I know that in life
