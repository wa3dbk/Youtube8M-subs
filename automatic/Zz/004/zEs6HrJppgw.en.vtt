00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.950 

much<00:02:51.830> better

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:11.440 

probably<00:02:55.650> 80%<00:02:56.540> there<00:02:57.540> 16<00:02:57.960> 928<00:02:58.740> fires<00:02:59.130> dough

so probably got a lot of good laughs

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:35.309 
so probably got a lot of good laughs
laughs<00:03:20.480> game

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.289 

and<00:03:35.920> this<00:03:36.069> is<00:03:36.219> what<00:03:36.400> I<00:03:36.430> heard<00:03:36.640> when<00:03:36.790> I<00:03:36.909> got<00:03:37.090> in

and this is what I heard when I got in

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.690 
and this is what I heard when I got in
this<00:03:37.480> beeping<00:03:37.930> sound<00:03:38.489> that<00:03:39.489> says

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
this beeping sound that says

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.690 
this beeping sound that says
transmission<00:03:40.510> pressure<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:42.280> like<00:03:42.400> say<00:03:42.609> the

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
transmission pressure the like say the

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.399 
transmission pressure the like say the
transmission<00:03:43.299> and<00:03:43.420> then<00:03:43.540> stop<00:03:43.810> engine<00:03:44.170> switch

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:44.409 
transmission and then stop engine switch

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:46.589 
transmission and then stop engine switch
comes<00:03:44.650> on<00:03:44.859> so<00:03:45.250> it<00:03:45.400> tells<00:03:45.670> me<00:03:45.819> it's<00:03:45.969> a<00:03:46.060> sensor<00:03:46.420> I

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
comes on so it tells me it's a sensor I

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.839
