there's a serious lack of contrast you
can<00:06:08.539> help<00:06:08.930> this<00:06:09.169> a<00:06:09.229> little<00:06:09.500> by<00:06:09.830> using<00:06:09.860> a<00:06:10.310> lens

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
can help this a little by using a lens

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.270 
can help this a little by using a lens
hood<00:06:10.669> as<00:06:11.000> I'm<00:06:11.539> showing<00:06:11.750> you<00:06:11.900> here<00:06:12.320> but<00:06:12.979> even

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
hood as I'm showing you here but even

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.760 
hood as I'm showing you here but even
then<00:06:13.550> the<00:06:14.120> problem<00:06:14.510> still<00:06:14.810> hangs<00:06:15.080> around

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
then the problem still hangs around

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.989 
then the problem still hangs around
another<00:06:16.770> issue<00:06:17.009> is<00:06:17.369> that<00:06:17.429> the<00:06:17.789> macro

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:17.999 
another issue is that the macro

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:21.109 
another issue is that the macro
performance<00:06:18.689> of<00:06:18.869> this<00:06:19.050> lens<00:06:19.289> is<00:06:19.499> not<00:06:19.830> good<00:06:20.159> the

00:06:21.109 --> 00:06:21.119 
performance of this lens is not good the

00:06:21.119 --> 00:06:23.689 
performance of this lens is not good the
lens<00:06:21.300> can<00:06:21.569> only<00:06:21.719> focus<00:06:22.229> down<00:06:22.409> to<00:06:22.619> about<00:06:22.830> 1.5

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:23.699 
lens can only focus down to about 1.5

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:26.989 
lens can only focus down to about 1.5
meters<00:06:23.969> so<00:06:24.959> this<00:06:25.319> is<00:06:25.559> as<00:06:26.129> close<00:06:26.369> to<00:06:26.639> my<00:06:26.759> house

00:06:26.989 --> 00:06:26.999 
meters so this is as close to my house
