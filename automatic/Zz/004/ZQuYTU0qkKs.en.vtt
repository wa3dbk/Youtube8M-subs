00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
but it's actually got this lace lighting

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.069 
but it's actually got this lace lighting
inside<00:01:54.540> which<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:55.020> very<00:01:55.950> pretty<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.780> it's<00:01:57.780> got

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
inside which is very pretty and it's got

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.380 
inside which is very pretty and it's got
the<00:01:58.259> tie<00:01:58.590> which<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.280> very<00:01:59.520> important<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.270> me

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
the tie which is very important to me

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.810 
the tie which is very important to me
because<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:01.140> always<00:02:01.350> sort<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.740> need<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.250> bit<00:02:02.790> more

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
because I always sort of need a bit more

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.060 
because I always sort of need a bit more
event<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.479> find<00:02:03.750> way<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.229> like<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.590> wear<00:02:04.920> it

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
event to find way so I like to wear it

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.050 
event to find way so I like to wear it
open<00:02:05.460> but<00:02:05.969> then<00:02:06.149> tied<00:02:06.450> at<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.810> back

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
open but then tied at the back

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.020 
open but then tied at the back
so<00:02:07.270> I<00:02:07.329> can<00:02:07.540> get<00:02:07.689> a<00:02:07.869> bit<00:02:08.110> more<00:02:08.470> definition<00:02:09.220> and
