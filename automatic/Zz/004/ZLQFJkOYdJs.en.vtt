weeks to make this video and the reason

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.810

games

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
games

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.289 
games
he<00:03:04.650> doesn't<00:03:04.920> upload<00:03:05.190> extremely<00:03:05.700> often<00:03:06.090> but<00:03:06.269> I

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
he doesn't upload extremely often but I

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.420 
he doesn't upload extremely often but I
do<00:03:06.420> think<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:06.930> when<00:03:07.319> he<00:03:07.349> does<00:03:07.650> upload<00:03:08.159> he

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
do think that when he does upload he

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.860 
do think that when he does upload he
puts<00:03:08.639> a<00:03:08.730> lot<00:03:08.909> of<00:03:09.030> work<00:03:09.150> into<00:03:09.299> his<00:03:09.510> videos<00:03:09.840> and

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
puts a lot of work into his videos and

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.270 
puts a lot of work into his videos and
that's<00:03:10.170> why<00:03:10.349> I<00:03:10.379> think<00:03:10.620> that<00:03:10.739> he<00:03:10.829> deserves<00:03:10.950> a

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
that's why I think that he deserves a

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.910 
that's why I think that he deserves a
shout<00:03:11.459> out<00:03:11.489> and<00:03:11.879> last<00:03:12.750> but<00:03:12.959> not<00:03:13.079> least<00:03:13.379> unless
