dangling<00:01:32.070> there<00:01:32.340> they<00:01:33.060> never<00:01:33.240> had<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.630> hooked

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
dangling there they never had it hooked

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.420 
dangling there they never had it hooked
up<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.500> I'm<00:01:34.710> not<00:01:34.920> curious

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
up so I'm not curious

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.219 
up so I'm not curious
I'm<00:01:35.579> just<00:01:36.119> curious<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.570> where<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.810> goes<00:01:36.990> they

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
I'm just curious of where it goes they

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.910 
I'm just curious of where it goes they
never<00:01:37.439> had<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.650> hooked<00:01:37.799> up<00:01:37.979> anywhere<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:39.920> does

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
never had it hooked up anywhere so does

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.899 
never had it hooked up anywhere so does
the<00:01:41.250> +<00:01:41.579> does<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.659> plus<00:01:43.020> wire<00:01:43.320> here<00:01:43.860> going<00:01:44.700> all

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
the + does this plus wire here going all

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.149 
the + does this plus wire here going all
the<00:01:45.030> way<00:01:45.060> up<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.420> her<00:01:45.509> my<00:01:46.020> finger<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.500> does<00:01:46.950> that

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
the way up to her my finger is does that

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.260 
the way up to her my finger is does that
go<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.790> on/off<00:01:48.270> switch<00:01:49.340> this<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.880> on/off

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
go to the on/off switch this the on/off

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.209 
go to the on/off switch this the on/off
switch<00:01:51.500> or<00:01:52.909> does<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:53.939> go<00:01:54.299> down<00:01:54.960> here<00:01:55.500> on<00:01:55.649> the

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
switch or does it go down here on the

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.959 
switch or does it go down here on the
regulator<00:01:56.930> in<00:01:58.100> one<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.189> these<00:01:59.310> plugs<00:01:59.670> which

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
regulator in one of these plugs which

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.499 
regulator in one of these plugs which
would<00:02:00.149> be<00:02:00.329> one<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.380> three<00:02:01.939> who<00:02:02.939> knows

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
would be one of the three who knows

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.050 
would be one of the three who knows
they<00:02:04.469> had<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.829> running<00:02:05.040> up<00:02:05.280> here<00:02:05.520> like<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.880> went

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
they had it running up here like it went

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.520 
they had it running up here like it went
to<00:02:06.180> here<00:02:06.450> but<00:02:06.600> they<00:02:06.719> never<00:02:06.899> had<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.200> hooked<00:02:07.320> up

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
to here but they never had it hooked up

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.619 
to here but they never had it hooked up
to<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.799> so<00:02:08.369> if<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.670> guys<00:02:08.849> know<00:02:09.149> where<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.450> goes

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
to it so if you guys know where it goes

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.690 
to it so if you guys know where it goes
that<00:02:10.229> would<00:02:10.379> be<00:02:10.500> great<00:02:10.800> because<00:02:11.009> I'll<00:02:11.400> hook<00:02:11.550> it

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
that would be great because I'll hook it

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.820 
that would be great because I'll hook it
up<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:11.970> then<00:02:12.360> we<00:02:12.510> can<00:02:12.660> try<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.810> fire<00:02:13.110> but<00:02:13.500> right

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
up and then we can try to fire but right

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.350 
up and then we can try to fire but right
I<00:02:13.860> kid<00:02:14.190> ain't<00:02:14.340> gonna<00:02:14.520> fire<00:02:14.760> if<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.090> don't<00:02:15.270> know

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
I kid ain't gonna fire if I don't know

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.210 
I kid ain't gonna fire if I don't know
where<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.570> heck<00:02:15.720> that<00:02:15.900> wire<00:02:16.140> goes<00:02:16.470> so<00:02:17.010> if<00:02:17.100> you

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
where the heck that wire goes so if you

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.430 
where the heck that wire goes so if you
guys<00:02:17.400> know<00:02:17.640> where<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:17.910> wire<00:02:18.120> goes<00:02:18.480> like<00:02:19.290> I

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
guys know where that wire goes like I

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.760 
guys know where that wire goes like I
said<00:02:19.650> plus<00:02:20.160> wire<00:02:20.460> coming<00:02:20.940> out<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.620> they<00:02:22.620> had

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
said plus wire coming out and they had

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.430 
said plus wire coming out and they had
it<00:02:22.920> ran<00:02:23.100> up<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.460> here<00:02:23.760> it<00:02:24.660> either<00:02:24.840> goes<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.170> the

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
it ran up to here it either goes to the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.320 
it ran up to here it either goes to the
on/off<00:02:25.860> switch<00:02:25.890> or<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:26.820> goes<00:02:27.000> down<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.300> that

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
on/off switch or it goes down to that

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.540 
on/off switch or it goes down to that
regulator<00:02:27.870> I'm<00:02:28.080> thinking<00:02:28.470> if<00:02:28.860> not<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.400> guys

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
regulator I'm thinking if not you guys

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.910 
regulator I'm thinking if not you guys
let<00:02:29.820> me<00:02:29.850> know<00:02:29.970> so<00:02:30.870> yeah<00:02:31.050> that's<00:02:31.530> what<00:02:31.710> I<00:02:31.770> was

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
let me know so yeah that's what I was

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.040 
let me know so yeah that's what I was
gonna<00:02:32.040> show<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.400> on<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.850> cub<00:02:33.030> cadet<00:02:33.360> it's<00:02:33.870> not

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
gonna show you on the cub cadet it's not

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.020 
gonna show you on the cub cadet it's not
that<00:02:34.260> big<00:02:34.440> of<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.650> deal<00:02:34.920> it's<00:02:35.280> either<00:02:35.490> the<00:02:35.730> wire

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
that big of a deal it's either the wire

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.550 
that big of a deal it's either the wire
goes<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.600> on/off<00:02:37.020> switch<00:02:37.050> or<00:02:37.530> the

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
goes to the on/off switch or the

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.260 
goes to the on/off switch or the
regulator<00:02:38.100> I<00:02:38.340> don't<00:02:38.640> see<00:02:38.760> where<00:02:38.880> it<00:02:38.940> would<00:02:39.120> go

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
regulator I don't see where it would go

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.790 
regulator I don't see where it would go
anywhere<00:02:39.600> else<00:02:39.810> it's<00:02:40.140> not<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.290> ground<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:40.770> don't

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
anywhere else it's not a ground I don't

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.220 
anywhere else it's not a ground I don't
think<00:02:41.190> can't<00:02:41.700> because<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.150> negative<00:02:43.080> would

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
think can't because the negative would

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.290 
think can't because the negative would
be<00:02:43.290> but<00:02:43.560> who<00:02:43.680> knows<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.940> guys<00:02:45.120> will

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
be but who knows so you guys will

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.360 
be but who knows so you guys will
probably<00:02:45.330> tell<00:02:45.780> me<00:02:45.930> where<00:02:46.050> it<00:02:46.170> goes<00:02:46.350> so<00:02:46.860> I'll

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
probably tell me where it goes so I'll

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.520 
probably tell me where it goes so I'll
go<00:02:47.670> upload<00:02:48.030> this<00:02:48.180> on<00:02:48.390> youtube<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:49.110> hopefully

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
go upload this on youtube and hopefully

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.440 
go upload this on youtube and hopefully
I<00:02:49.560> get<00:02:49.620> an<00:02:49.800> answer<00:02:49.950> real<00:02:50.310> quick<00:02:50.520> so<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:51.120> can
