00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.349 
collectible case now I'm keeping it
carded<00:00:26.310> because<00:00:26.519> this<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.789> basically<00:00:27.210> a

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
carded because this is basically a

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.349 
carded because this is basically a
repaint<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.550> power<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.730> force<00:00:29.939> line

repaint of the power of the force line

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.229

it's<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.740> steroid<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.920> out<00:00:32.070> Darth<00:00:32.669> Vader<00:00:33.000> here

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
it's the steroid it out Darth Vader here

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.950 
it's the steroid it out Darth Vader here
and<00:00:33.829> so<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.160> don't<00:00:35.940> really<00:00:36.090> see<00:00:36.300> any<00:00:36.510> reason<00:00:36.600> to

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
and so I don't really see any reason to

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.630 
and so I don't really see any reason to
open<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.350> because<00:00:37.770> it's<00:00:38.070> not<00:00:38.190> particularly

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
open it because it's not particularly

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.889 
open it because it's not particularly
special<00:00:38.790> figure<00:00:39.090> but<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.390> does<00:00:39.540> look<00:00:39.750> really

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
special figure but it does look really

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.750 
special figure but it does look really

sculpt the belt looks different but

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.030 
sculpt the belt looks different but
that's<00:01:27.210> only<00:01:27.420> because<00:01:27.570> it's<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.560> same<00:01:28.770> belt

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040

on<00:01:29.220> Boba<00:01:29.579> Fett<00:01:29.820> here<00:01:30.060> but<00:01:30.329> they<00:01:30.420> turned<00:01:30.689> it

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
on Boba Fett here but they turned it

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.580

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
around and didn't paint it okay so it's

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.030 
around and didn't paint it okay so it's
not<00:01:34.650> exactly<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.220> new<00:01:35.369> figure<00:01:36.079> same<00:01:37.079> gun
