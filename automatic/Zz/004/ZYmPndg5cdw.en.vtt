00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.490
 I'm going to teach everything there is to know 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.880
 choose the most suitable awning for 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.880

 besides allowing you to enjoy more of your 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.660
 terrace or garden sheltered from the sun a 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.730
 awning will help you control the 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.379
 indoor temperature of your house creating 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.120
 an outer space with less 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.500
 temperature and avoiding heating 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.680
 of the sun on the walls of your home 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.870
 so you can spend less electricity on 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.519
 the air conditioning system which 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.680
 it means a savings of it 's bill 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:53.769
 electricity and less CO2 emissions to the 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.769
 atmosphere 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.829
 there are many types of all but the 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.720
 most common are two depending on your 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.229
 installation place for terrace or 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.150
 garden and for window or balcony you must 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.010
 choose the awning model depending on 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.900
 your place of location and do not forget 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.670
 consult with your neighborhood community if 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.300
 there is some agreement on the color of 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.430
 the fabric or the location of the all 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.750
 once chosen the type of awning what 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.150
 first thing you should keep in mind are 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.590
 the measures the length of the awning what 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.420
 determines the width of the window or 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.130
 terrace where you are going to install it but 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.690
 you must also take into account the progress 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.790
 that is the depth of the awning 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.710
 being fully extended since 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.240
 along with the room of your house and the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.480
 time of day will determine the surface 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.790
 of shadow projected by the whole 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.140
 the measurements of the awnings are indicated 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.390
 the following way long by advance 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.790
 in your store you will find all standard 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.530
 up to 6 meters long by 3.5 meters 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.240
 advance and if you do not find a measure that 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.010
 you need choose a model from our 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.810
 wide range of all tailored if you 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.400
 you need a professional will move to 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.560
 your address to give you the best 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.390
 solution and install you the other aspect 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.280
 important in choosing an awning is 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.410
 the structure there are several 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.729
 aluminum materials resist 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.619
 better effects of the agents 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.690
 atmospheric and do not rust in addition to 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.890
 be lighter the steel ones are 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.260
 suitable for protected sites 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.700
 under a roof or cantilever in addition to 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.200
 material of the structure you should know 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.150
 that there are sensor arms with one or 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.920
 two steel cables latter you 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.370
 ensure a longer life of the 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.379
 product 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.720
 and finally look at the type of 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.100
 structure without casing mechanism and 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.740
 everything is exposed to empires 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.600
 I'm cheated when everything is collected 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.640
 fabric is protected by the semi box 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.470
 only the skirt and the 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.000
 arms 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.470
 integral chest protects both the fabric 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.210
 like the structure when everything is 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.600
 collected is a discrete option and 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.600
 esthetic 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.650
 once you have clear the measures and the 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.349
 type of structure you need for your 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.319
 awning chooses the fabric there are three types of 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.329
 Polyester fabric is the most economical but 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.969
 its performance and durability are more 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.859
 limited acrylic guarantees the 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:04.689
 durability of colors and resists very 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:06.579
 well the tears the wind and the 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:09.129
 humidity also provide a 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:11.829
 Sunscreen has a guarantee of 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:13.599
 three years microperforated has like 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.669
 Advantage that allows to evacuate the air 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.169
 hot that accumulates under the fabric what 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:19.450
 which guarantees a lower temperature 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:21.939
 under the awning has a guarantee of 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.129
 four years when you decide for a 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:26.799
 material chooses the smooth pattern stamped 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:29.169
 or of colors you have more than 45 fabrics 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.939
 different to choose finally you'll have 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:33.430
 to decide if you want to add other 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:34.870
 benefits to your awning you can motorize 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.790
 your awning to automate your 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.060
 operation to handle it some 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.410
 models carry a wall switch 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.410
 and others a remote control 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.360
 If the whole has an engine, you can incorporate 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.280
 also sensors 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.350
 wind sensor picks up the awning 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.450
 automatically if there is wind takes a 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.400
 remote control wind sensor sun and 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.990
 rain I pick up everything automatically in 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.210
 case of wind and rain and deploys it 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.040
 in case of sun up here our 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.540
 explanation, we invite you to visit the 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.800
