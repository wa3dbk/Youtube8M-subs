 this has already been confirmed is in case 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.559
 there is actually a version of the old 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.059
 generation would not be imported by 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.090
 troika that is only developing 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.909
 4 pcs of the versions and the OK 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.700
 this year the block would have been 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.100
 internet binoculars with the help of mercer 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:19.140
 nery technology service or two other 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.840
 developer leave the Actvision abnote 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.409
 already has a certain history of deporting 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.570
 and this is cool because she's a 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.250
 great developer and nothing of the sort 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.009
 to launch major titles in the 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.590
 recent games is great since I am 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.450
 it was spider man games in senegal sou 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.420
 the minor's father asks for a team full of 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.150
 stains and threw the track months part of the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.530
 spider man also if I'm not mistaken or 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:49.500
 two and before that to launch games until 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.430
 2007, more or less, it only carried the 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.869
 games, right? 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.189
 it was acquired the video card there 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.810
 for 2005 and until then it only carried games 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.079
 she did a lot of port work 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.060
 mainly for pc is it was not 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.360
 no game for the console until today besides 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.910
 wii no more for xbox 360 ps3 no 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.069
 even matter why she worked in the 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.100
 3g generation of the country will have to import 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.670
 from these consoles to another platform 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.590
 dc or imeq things like this 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.780
 Right now it's going to be the first job. 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.580
 of them from the old generation 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.930
 but as I already mentioned a producer who has 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.580
 experience and import 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.260
 I believe you will develop a good 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.720
 work and help technology that 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.360
 producer is helping brinox in this 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.830
 development of this size is already 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.530
 a much more recent production company it was 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.630
 founded in 2010 and I have a job 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.440
 only that it was cut the 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:45.980
 transformers which speaks site uol to the 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.720
 pc is the game was released there for 2011 no 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.250
 I know I do not remember the right year of the 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.740
 transformism at 71 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.990
 But it's finally confirmed, this is it. 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.180
 but it has also been confirmed that the 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.210
 game will have clear their downgrade will 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.950
 have differences for the version is from the new 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.600
 generation of the current generation 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.340
 the first that has already been confirmed 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.720
 including that they are already 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.180
 working for the campaign is only 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.710
 covers for two people as you know 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.870
 the sandoval actress campaign will be 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.970
 cooperative on new generation consoles 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.130
 of pcj to play up to four players 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.220
 apparently had no generation not being 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.200
 only two players cooperative is before 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.330
 The fans of zombies as horizon 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.190
 start to freak out and find that the cop 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.810
 new tabs also was not 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.000
 commented yet but I think a lot 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.710
 even unlikely because men are 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.930
 mounted on indy in multiplayer 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.690
 single player since black ops two 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.910
 So, you'll be able to bear with 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.550
 four cooperative players in the 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.500
 ok, it's stanley confirmed for 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.030
 people who, in the future, will be 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.730
 approaching the release date they 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.460
 they are going to release a list there is however 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.820
 difference that will have the old version and 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:56.000
 new version of the anec genius or will improve 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.820
 the current generation of gender and the other 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.280
 was old generation is the versions of these 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.080
 generations is the only 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.030
 downgrade even though they confirmed it was 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.630
 that is the question of the campaign people you 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:11.360
 two players only cooperatives of the 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.070
 campaign and four in the new generation they 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.050
 also confirmed that there is no sun of 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:18.470
 I understand the planned river, that is, the people 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.750
 should not have on the cop 3 for the right il in the 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.080
 e3 maybe give more details and 3 starts 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.760

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.630

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.160
 make one 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.190
 also talking what we should expect 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.900
 of black ops 3 ps3 will already train 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.380
 quite different people from the 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.880
 jury 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.560

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.880
 Your comment there is happy because 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.490
 so many more people will have access to 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.650
 I just hope that this version of the 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.110
 activities of the last generation 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.550
 do not hold too much in the new 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.220
 generation does not hinder the development 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.940
 of the next generation networks in the limit 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.830
 huh 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.110
 outside this is very positive news 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.690
 I think it's worth it is always cool 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:03.110
 basic people as possible have access to 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.100
 game and is able to play and then that's it 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.080
