tak 1911 it only took me what three

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.070 
tak 1911 it only took me what three
weeks<00:00:14.549> of<00:00:14.849> in-game<00:00:15.240> being<00:00:15.540> out<00:00:15.750> but<00:00:15.960> it's

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
weeks of in-game being out but it's

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.500 
weeks of in-game being out but it's
actually<00:00:16.410> one<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.740> more<00:00:17.010> tedious

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
actually one of the more tedious

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.939 
actually one of the more tedious
assignment<00:00:18.510> chains<00:00:18.750> that<00:00:19.080> I've<00:00:19.410> actually<00:00:19.650> had

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
assignment chains that I've actually had

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.490 
assignment chains that I've actually had
the<00:00:20.130> privilege<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.760> completing<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:22.230> in<00:00:22.410> the

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
the privilege of completing this in the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.400 
the privilege of completing this in the
mk3<00:00:22.890> a1<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.760> perhaps<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.240> l85<00:00:24.869> wind<00:00:25.170> five

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
mk3 a1 and perhaps the l85 wind five

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.589 
mk3 a1 and perhaps the l85 wind five
rounds<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.830> squad<00:00:26.130> deathmatch<00:00:26.609> those<00:00:27.449> are

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
rounds of squad deathmatch those are

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.960 
rounds of squad deathmatch those are
some<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.900> more<00:00:28.080> elusive<00:00:28.970> assignments

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
some of the more elusive assignments

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.370 
some of the more elusive assignments
especially<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.480> squad<00:00:30.720> deathmatch<00:00:31.170> because

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
especially the squad deathmatch because

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.959 
especially the squad deathmatch because
it's<00:00:31.500> really<00:00:31.740> hard<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.279> find<00:00:32.489> people<00:00:32.730> who

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
it's really hard to find people who

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.209 
it's really hard to find people who
actually<00:00:33.410> actually<00:00:34.410> play<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.800> these<00:00:34.980> days

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
actually actually play that these days

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.760 
actually actually play that these days
but<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.790> finally<00:00:36.360> unlocked<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.410> was<00:00:37.590> an

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
but I finally unlocked it and it was an

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.080 
but I finally unlocked it and it was an
interesting<00:00:38.040> journey<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.700> I'm<00:00:38.790> gonna<00:00:38.879> take

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.740 
you guys through my journey some of the
the<00:00:41.100> ups<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.520> downs<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.660> know

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
the ups and downs of it and you know

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.510 
the ups and downs of it and you know
capturing<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.410> flags<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:44.010> returning<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
capturing the flags and returning the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.400 
capturing the flags and returning the
flags<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.969> actually<00:00:45.300> pretty<00:00:45.539> simple<00:00:45.840> you

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
flags is actually pretty simple you

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
flags is actually pretty simple you
would<00:00:46.530> think<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.800> know<00:00:47.010> you're<00:00:47.190> like<00:00:47.340> oh

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.890 
you're never gonna let them take it in
the<00:01:29.729> first<00:01:29.939> place<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.329> actually<00:01:30.479> had<00:01:30.780> to

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
the first place so I actually had to

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.929 
the first place so I actually had to
train<00:01:31.170> myself<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.799> let<00:01:31.979> them<00:01:32.189> step<00:01:32.490> outside<00:01:32.700> of

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
train myself to let them step outside of

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.640 
train myself to let them step outside of
the<00:01:33.119> base<00:01:33.270> with<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.570> flag<00:01:33.810> before<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.290> killed

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
the base with the flag before I killed

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.590 
the base with the flag before I killed
them<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:34.950> then<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.610> could<00:01:35.880> recapture<00:01:36.299> it

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
them and then I could recapture it

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.330 
them and then I could recapture it
because<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.590> way<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.799> know<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.070> were<00:01:38.220> at

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
because that way you know you were at

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.069 
because that way you know you were at
less<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.850> risk<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.509> just<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.810> was<00:01:39.840> much

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
less of a risk and it just it was much

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.630 
less of a risk and it just it was much
easier<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.590> way<00:01:40.770> because<00:01:40.950> otherwise<00:01:41.220> it

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
easier that way because otherwise it

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.370 
easier that way because otherwise it
auto<00:01:41.820> returns<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.570> never<00:01:42.750> unlock<00:01:43.200> that

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
auto returns and you never unlock that

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.630 
auto returns and you never unlock that
assignment<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:43.979> actually<00:01:44.310> took<00:01:44.460> me<00:01:44.610> a

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
assignment so that actually took me a

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.819 
assignment so that actually took me a
lot<00:01:44.850> longer<00:01:44.909> than<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.420> had<00:01:45.600> anticipated<00:01:45.869> now

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
lot longer than I had anticipated now

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.590 
lot longer than I had anticipated now
another<00:01:47.070> one<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.310> actually<00:01:47.549> had<00:01:47.939> problems<00:01:48.420> with

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
another one I actually had problems with

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.870 
another one I actually had problems with
was<00:01:49.140> destroy<00:01:49.560> five<00:01:49.920> air<00:01:50.189> vehicles<00:01:50.670> with<00:01:50.850> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
was destroy five air vehicles with the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.609 
was destroy five air vehicles with the
anti-air<00:01:51.450> G<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:52.020> you're<00:01:52.110> like<00:01:52.229> oh<00:01:52.350> that's

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
anti-air G and you're like oh that's

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.260 
anti-air G and you're like oh that's
simple<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.070> know<00:01:53.189> use<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.549> lock<00:01:53.729> on<00:01:53.939> spam

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
simple you know use the lock on spam

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.789 
simple you know use the lock on spam
missiles<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:55.140> know<00:01:55.259> they're<00:01:55.439> down<00:01:55.590> an

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
missiles you know they're down an

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.200 
missiles you know they're down an
instant<00:01:56.219> well<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.520> know<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.700> would<00:01:56.880> think<00:01:56.909> it

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
instant well you know you would think it

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.670 
instant well you know you would think it
would<00:01:57.299> be<00:01:57.329> easy<00:01:57.570> but<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.990> problem<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.469> ran<00:01:58.619> into

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
would be easy but the problem I ran into

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.789 
would be easy but the problem I ran into
as<00:01:59.159> everybody<00:01:59.909> wanted<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.390> drive<00:02:00.689> my<00:02:00.719> my<00:02:01.560> Jeep

as everybody wanted to drive my my Jeep

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.800 
as everybody wanted to drive my my Jeep
off<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.399> get<00:02:02.640> me<00:02:02.759> killed<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.360> happened

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
off and get me killed and that happened

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.149 
off and get me killed and that happened
so<00:02:04.049> many<00:02:04.170> times<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.619> was<00:02:04.740> getting<00:02:04.920> so

I can't destroy aircraft by just ramming

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.440 
I can't destroy aircraft by just ramming
into<00:02:16.860> him<00:02:17.099> because<00:02:17.219> I'm<00:02:17.459> just<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.790> Jeep<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.209> need

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:20.219 
my lock-on missile so that was a little

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:21.649 
my lock-on missile so that was a little
bit<00:02:20.430> frustrating<00:02:21.030> but<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.299> one<00:02:21.420> thing<00:02:21.629> that

bit frustrating but the one thing that

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.390 
bit frustrating but the one thing that
everyone<00:02:22.079> seems<00:02:22.319> to<00:02:22.409> be<00:02:22.620> most<00:02:22.829> frustrated

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
everyone seems to be most frustrated

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.490 
everyone seems to be most frustrated
with<00:02:23.579> is<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:24.239> one<00:02:24.420> I've<00:02:24.659> actually<00:02:24.900> found<00:02:25.290> to

with is the one I've actually found to

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.160 
with is the one I've actually found to
be<00:02:25.560> pretty<00:02:26.010> easy<00:02:26.250> which<00:02:26.579> is<00:02:26.609> destroy<00:02:27.209> one

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
be pretty easy which is destroy one

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.619 
be pretty easy which is destroy one
enemy<00:02:28.379> IFV<00:02:29.040> with<00:02:29.340> an<00:02:29.489> airdrop<00:02:29.879> diet<00:02:30.209> v--<00:02:30.390> and

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
enemy IFV with an airdrop diet v-- and

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.679 
enemy IFV with an airdrop diet v-- and
destroy<00:02:31.019> a<00:02:31.640> enemy<00:02:32.640> transport<00:02:33.150> vehicle<00:02:33.540> from

an<00:02:33.810> airdrop<00:02:34.260> die<00:02:34.470> Fe<00:02:34.739> pretty<00:02:35.189> simple<00:02:35.609> not

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
an airdrop die Fe pretty simple not

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.910 
an airdrop die Fe pretty simple not
really<00:02:36.299> that<00:02:36.450> hard<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:37.079> problem<00:02:37.470> is<00:02:37.620> is<00:02:37.799> you

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
really that hard the problem is is you

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.190 
really that hard the problem is is you
just<00:02:38.129> gotta<00:02:38.400> find<00:02:38.700> one<00:02:38.939> I<00:02:39.150> found<00:02:39.689> that<00:02:39.780> Nebadon

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
just gotta find one I found that Nebadon

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.780 
just gotta find one I found that Nebadon
flats<00:02:40.470> is<00:02:40.620> actually<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:40.980> easiest<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.489> do<00:02:41.639> this

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
flats is actually the easiest to do this

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.520 
flats is actually the easiest to do this
on<00:02:41.970> just<00:02:42.209> because<00:02:42.420> it's<00:02:42.599> so<00:02:42.780> wide<00:02:42.989> open<00:02:43.049> as

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
on just because it's so wide open as

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.979 
on just because it's so wide open as
you're<00:02:43.739> dropped<00:02:44.040> from<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.400> dropship<00:02:45.150> you

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
you're dropped from the dropship you

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.539 
you're dropped from the dropship you
actually<00:02:46.319> can<00:02:46.470> see<00:02:46.709> where<00:02:47.099> everything<00:02:47.370> is

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
actually can see where everything is

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.309 
actually can see where everything is
that<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:47.879> can<00:02:48.030> kind<00:02:48.239> of<00:02:48.329> spot<00:02:48.659> ifvs<00:02:49.139> from

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
that you can kind of spot ifvs from

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.110 
that you can kind of spot ifvs from
pretty<00:02:49.530> far<00:02:49.560> away<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.250> it's<00:02:50.549> pretty<00:02:50.790> simple

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
pretty far away and it's pretty simple

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.819 
pretty far away and it's pretty simple
to<00:02:51.269> say<00:02:51.419> okay<00:02:51.900> I<00:02:52.049> need<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.319> go<00:02:52.470> over<00:02:52.650> here

assignment don't really care if I die

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.849 
assignment don't really care if I die
that's<00:02:56.909> kind<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.269> mentality<00:02:57.389> I<00:02:57.780> took<00:02:58.109> and

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
that's kind of the mentality I took and

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.399 
that's kind of the mentality I took and
I<00:02:58.980> finally<00:02:59.430> completed<00:02:59.909> it<00:03:00.030> after<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.810> lot<00:03:01.230> of

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
I finally completed it after a lot of

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:02.780 
I finally completed it after a lot of
round<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:01.919> know<00:03:02.010> I<00:03:02.040> thought<00:03:02.370> that<00:03:02.430> this<00:03:02.639> would

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
round you know I thought that this would

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.759 
round you know I thought that this would
be<00:03:02.849> pretty<00:03:03.419> easy<00:03:03.599> I<00:03:03.780> mean<00:03:03.959> it's<00:03:04.109> not<00:03:04.230> hard<00:03:04.560> it's

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
be pretty easy I mean it's not hard it's

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.289 
be pretty easy I mean it's not hard it's
just<00:03:04.950> like<00:03:05.400> I<00:03:05.430> said<00:03:05.579> it's<00:03:05.819> more<00:03:05.970> like<00:03:06.180> an

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
just like I said it's more like an

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.970 
just like I said it's more like an
Easter<00:03:06.659> egg<00:03:06.810> hunt<00:03:06.840> it's<00:03:07.290> like<00:03:07.409> okay<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:07.709> need<00:03:07.829> to

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
Easter egg hunt it's like okay I need to

Easter egg hunt it's like okay I need to
find<00:03:08.069> this<00:03:08.370> I<00:03:08.549> have<00:03:08.669> V<00:03:08.849> where<00:03:09.389> are<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.540> at<00:03:09.720> once

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
find this I have V where are you at once

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.869 
find this I have V where are you at once
you<00:03:10.769> do<00:03:10.889> find<00:03:11.129> it<00:03:11.220> though<00:03:11.340> you<00:03:11.400> know<00:03:11.549> you<00:03:11.669> can

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
you do find it though you know you can

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.220 
you do find it though you know you can
probably<00:03:12.209> complete<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.599> pretty<00:03:12.810> quickly<00:03:13.019> if

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
probably complete it pretty quickly if

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.479 
probably complete it pretty quickly if
you've<00:03:13.319> got<00:03:13.530> someone<00:03:13.739> who<00:03:13.889> actually<00:03:14.069> wants<00:03:14.250> to

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:16.439 
drive there's around well like I said

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:19.309 
drive there's around well like I said
not<00:03:16.859> really<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.400> difficult<00:03:17.970> task<00:03:18.180> just<00:03:18.900> more<00:03:19.139> of

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
not really a difficult task just more of

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.020 
not really a difficult task just more of
a<00:03:19.440> timing<00:03:19.859> thing<00:03:19.889> and<00:03:20.280> killing<00:03:20.579> one<00:03:20.699> enemy

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030

should<00:03:22.799> be<00:03:22.889> able<00:03:22.979> to<00:03:23.069> do<00:03:23.190> that<00:03:23.340> simply<00:03:23.639> so<00:03:24.030> I

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
should be able to do that simply so I

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.119 
should be able to do that simply so I
did<00:03:24.659> complete<00:03:25.019> this<00:03:25.169> pretty<00:03:25.470> quickly<00:03:25.739> like<00:03:25.889> I

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
did complete this pretty quickly like I

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.649 
did complete this pretty quickly like I
said<00:03:26.370> though<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.609> anti-air<00:03:27.090> Jeep's<00:03:27.419> was

said though the anti-air Jeep's was

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.300 
said though the anti-air Jeep's was
probably<00:03:28.079> the<00:03:28.199> most<00:03:28.409> frustrating<00:03:28.709> of<00:03:29.220> the

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
probably the most frustrating of the

probably the most frustrating of the
vehicle<00:03:29.879> type<00:03:30.090> things<00:03:30.389> just<00:03:30.659> because<00:03:31.019> it

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
vehicle type things just because it

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.229 
vehicle type things just because it
seemed<00:03:31.799> like<00:03:31.979> everybody<00:03:32.250> wanted<00:03:32.729> to<00:03:32.849> steal<00:03:33.060> my

really felt selfish lately you know I'm

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.280 
really felt selfish lately you know I'm
sitting<00:03:39.329> here<00:03:39.479> trying<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.870> be<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:40.019> team<00:03:40.229> player

shoot down aircrafts and I get people
hopping<00:03:42.569> into<00:03:42.870> my<00:03:43.079> Jeep<00:03:43.319> and<00:03:43.470> driving<00:03:44.310> me<00:03:44.459> off

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
in the suicide land and that's pretty

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.830 
in the suicide land and that's pretty
freaking<00:03:47.519> frustrating<00:03:48.090> but<00:03:48.209> I<00:03:48.269> did<00:03:48.479> find<00:03:48.750> that

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
freaking frustrating but I did find that

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.170 
freaking frustrating but I did find that
you<00:03:49.019> can<00:03:49.199> actually<00:03:49.379> get<00:03:49.799> the<00:03:50.159> the<00:03:50.940> five

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
you can actually get the the five

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.789 
you can actually get the the five
aircraft<00:03:51.389> destroys<00:03:52.109> by<00:03:52.319> shooting<00:03:52.680> him<00:03:52.769> with

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
aircraft destroys by shooting him with

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.369 
aircraft destroys by shooting him with
the<00:03:53.099> rocket<00:03:53.489> pods<00:03:53.699> himself<00:03:54.209> so<00:03:54.540> I<00:03:54.750> actually

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
the rocket pods himself so I actually

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.770 
the rocket pods himself so I actually
got<00:03:55.949> more<00:03:56.159> just<00:03:56.400> destroys<00:03:56.970> with<00:03:57.209> the<00:03:57.359> rocket

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
got more just destroys with the rocket

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.119 
got more just destroys with the rocket
pods<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:58.169> actually<00:03:58.470> did<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.680> LA<00:03:58.859> cons

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
pods and actually did the LA cons

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.280 
pods and actually did the LA cons
because<00:03:59.540> people<00:04:00.540> do<00:04:00.659> play<00:04:00.870> pretty

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
because people do play pretty

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.559 
because people do play pretty
tentatively<00:04:01.829> and<00:04:02.129> they<00:04:02.220> tend<00:04:02.729> to<00:04:02.819> play<00:04:03.299> really

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
tentatively and they tend to play really

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.149 
tentatively and they tend to play really
far<00:04:03.900> back<00:04:04.169> in<00:04:04.349> the<00:04:04.379> helicopters<00:04:04.949> on<00:04:05.069> the

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 
far back in the helicopters on the

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:06.800 
far back in the helicopters on the
in-game<00:04:05.459> maps<00:04:05.729> for<00:04:05.939> whatever<00:04:06.150> reason<00:04:06.659> I<00:04:06.750> think

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
in-game maps for whatever reason I think

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.629 
in-game maps for whatever reason I think
I<00:04:07.260> think<00:04:07.530> one<00:04:07.650> of<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.799> reasons<00:04:08.099> is<00:04:08.220> is<00:04:08.370> a<00:04:08.430> lot

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
I think one of the reasons is is a lot

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.039 
I think one of the reasons is is a lot
of<00:04:08.729> the<00:04:08.819> attack<00:04:09.090> choppers<00:04:09.509> can<00:04:09.689> actually

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
of the attack choppers can actually

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.689 
of the attack choppers can actually
shoot<00:04:10.319> from<00:04:10.530> point<00:04:10.829> A<00:04:10.919> to<00:04:10.979> point<00:04:11.129> B<00:04:11.400> without

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:11.699 
shoot from point A to point B without

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:13.550 
shoot from point A to point B without
actually<00:04:12.180> leaving<00:04:12.389> their<00:04:12.629> spawn<00:04:12.900> so<00:04:13.439> it's

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
actually leaving their spawn so it's

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.349 
actually leaving their spawn so it's
much<00:04:13.769> more<00:04:13.799> advantageous<00:04:14.220> for<00:04:14.639> them<00:04:15.000> to<00:04:15.180> just

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
much more advantageous for them to just

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:16.729 
much more advantageous for them to just
stay<00:04:15.540> in<00:04:15.599> their<00:04:15.780> spawn<00:04:16.049> and<00:04:16.259> shoot<00:04:16.380> TV

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
stay in their spawn and shoot TV

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.259 
stay in their spawn and shoot TV
missiles<00:04:17.159> and<00:04:17.310> you<00:04:17.370> know<00:04:17.489> rocket<00:04:17.759> pods<00:04:18.090> and

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
missiles and you know rocket pods and

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.240 
missiles and you know rocket pods and
stuff<00:04:18.449> back<00:04:19.320> where<00:04:19.500> you<00:04:19.590> can't<00:04:19.799> lock<00:04:20.009> onto

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
stuff back where you can't lock onto

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.800 
stuff back where you can't lock onto
them<00:04:20.519> and<00:04:20.639> oftentimes<00:04:20.970> they<00:04:21.269> can<00:04:21.419> destroy<00:04:21.750> you

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
them and oftentimes they can destroy you

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.170 
them and oftentimes they can destroy you
from<00:04:22.139> pretty<00:04:22.380> far<00:04:22.440> away<00:04:22.740> so<00:04:23.610> I<00:04:23.639> guess<00:04:23.849> that<00:04:24.060> is

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
from pretty far away so I guess that is

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.420 
from pretty far away so I guess that is
a<00:04:24.240> tad<00:04:24.570> frustrating<00:04:25.260> especially<00:04:26.099> since<00:04:26.310> it

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
a tad frustrating especially since it

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.960 
a tad frustrating especially since it
should<00:04:26.610> be

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
should be

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.630 
should be
as<00:04:27.480> you<00:04:27.660> see<00:04:27.840> me<00:04:27.990> unlock<00:04:28.320> yet<00:04:28.620> another<00:04:29.040> one<00:04:29.550> of

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
as you see me unlock yet another one of

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.840 
as you see me unlock yet another one of
my<00:04:29.820> my<00:04:30.620> requirements<00:04:31.620> to<00:04:31.770> get<00:04:31.920> the<00:04:32.070> IFV<00:04:32.340> from

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
my my requirements to get the IFV from

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.240 
my my requirements to get the IFV from
from<00:04:33.510> above<00:04:33.810> assignment<00:04:34.380> which<00:04:34.650> is<00:04:34.680> destroyed

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
from above assignment which is destroyed

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.610 
from above assignment which is destroyed
one<00:04:35.460> transport<00:04:36.000> vehicle<00:04:36.360> but<00:04:36.570> like<00:04:37.350> I<00:04:37.470> said

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
one transport vehicle but like I said

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.170 
one transport vehicle but like I said
this<00:04:37.770> isn't<00:04:37.950> really<00:04:38.190> a<00:04:38.310> hard<00:04:38.520> challenge<00:04:38.730> it's

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
this isn't really a hard challenge it's

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.420 
this isn't really a hard challenge it's
just<00:04:39.360> more<00:04:39.720> of<00:04:39.870> a<00:04:39.990> a<00:04:40.200> painstaking<00:04:40.590> type<00:04:41.250> thing

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
just more of a a painstaking type thing

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.340 
just more of a a painstaking type thing
it's<00:04:41.580> more<00:04:41.730> like<00:04:41.880> an<00:04:42.000> endeavor<00:04:42.360> and<00:04:42.990> when<00:04:43.320> I

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
it's more like an endeavor and when I

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.810 
it's more like an endeavor and when I
set<00:04:43.590> out<00:04:43.710> to<00:04:43.740> do<00:04:43.950> this<00:04:44.130> I<00:04:44.220> was<00:04:44.310> like<00:04:44.430> okay<00:04:44.670> I'm

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
I'm gonna do a showdown on it but I

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.960 
I'm gonna do a showdown on it but I
didn't<00:04:49.380> unlock<00:04:49.530> it<00:04:49.860> in<00:04:49.980> time<00:04:50.160> I<00:04:50.190> released<00:04:50.760> a

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
didn't unlock it in time I released a

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.880 
didn't unlock it in time I released a
showdown<00:04:51.330> on<00:04:51.390> Friday<00:04:51.780> because<00:04:52.320> it<00:04:52.560> was<00:04:52.680> just

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
showdown on Friday because it was just

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.560 
showdown on Friday because it was just
taking<00:04:53.220> me<00:04:53.310> so<00:04:53.550> much<00:04:53.760> longer<00:04:54.030> and<00:04:54.270> I'm<00:04:54.450> like

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
okay I finally see an enemy IFV over

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.480 
okay I finally see an enemy IFV over
here<00:04:57.840> this<00:04:58.140> is<00:04:58.200> the<00:04:58.350> moment<00:04:58.710> I'm<00:04:58.980> finally

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
here this is the moment I'm finally

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.580 
here this is the moment I'm finally
going<00:04:59.700> to<00:04:59.820> unlock<00:05:00.240> this<00:05:00.660> stupid<00:05:01.320> assignment

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
going to unlock this stupid assignment

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.320 
going to unlock this stupid assignment
so<00:05:01.890> I<00:05:01.920> can<00:05:02.160> move<00:05:02.340> on<00:05:02.580> and<00:05:02.820> get<00:05:02.940> some<00:05:03.150> of<00:05:03.270> the

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
so I can move on and get some of the

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.550 
so I can move on and get some of the
easier<00:05:03.660> ones<00:05:03.870> because<00:05:04.050> it<00:05:04.140> seems<00:05:04.290> like<00:05:04.440> the

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
easier ones because it seems like the

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.960 
easier ones because it seems like the
harder<00:05:04.740> ones<00:05:05.070> are<00:05:05.190> the<00:05:05.280> first<00:05:05.520> couple<00:05:05.730> ones

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
harder ones are the first couple ones

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.310 
harder ones are the first couple ones
and<00:05:06.270> once<00:05:06.420> you<00:05:06.540> unlock<00:05:06.690> the<00:05:06.990> other<00:05:07.020> ones

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
and once you unlock the other ones

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.250 
and once you unlock the other ones
they're<00:05:07.860> pretty<00:05:08.220> pretty<00:05:08.490> simple<00:05:08.840> not<00:05:09.840> really

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
they're pretty pretty simple not really

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.470 
they're pretty pretty simple not really
that<00:05:10.410> difficult<00:05:10.680> and<00:05:11.130> I<00:05:11.340> finally<00:05:12.000> win<00:05:12.330> this

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
that difficult and I finally win this

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.870 
that difficult and I finally win this
battle<00:05:12.720> and<00:05:13.020> I<00:05:13.290> unlock<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:14.070> next<00:05:14.370> round<00:05:14.730> of

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
battle and I unlock the next round of

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.150 
battle and I unlock the next round of
assignments<00:05:15.510> so<00:05:15.690> I<00:05:15.900> have<00:05:16.320> V<00:05:16.560> out<00:05:16.770> of<00:05:16.890> the<00:05:16.980> way<00:05:17.130> I

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
assignments so I have V out of the way I

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.920 
assignments so I have V out of the way I
know<00:05:17.310> a<00:05:17.370> lot<00:05:17.520> of<00:05:17.640> people<00:05:17.820> had<00:05:18.030> a<00:05:18.060> lot<00:05:18.180> of

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
know a lot of people had a lot of

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.200 
know a lot of people had a lot of
problems<00:05:19.260> with<00:05:19.380> this<00:05:19.590> but<00:05:19.890> like<00:05:20.700> I<00:05:20.760> said<00:05:20.880> it's

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
problems with this but like I said it's

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.080 
problems with this but like I said it's
not<00:05:21.500> super<00:05:22.500> difficult<00:05:22.740> I<00:05:23.280> mean<00:05:23.520> once<00:05:23.700> I<00:05:23.850> found

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
not super difficult I mean once I found

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.670 
not super difficult I mean once I found
where<00:05:24.390> he<00:05:24.480> was<00:05:24.600> that<00:05:24.630> I<00:05:24.780> could<00:05:25.110> win<00:05:25.290> the<00:05:25.410> battle

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
where he was that I could win the battle

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.020 
where he was that I could win the battle
pretty<00:05:25.890> easily<00:05:26.100> it's<00:05:26.400> just<00:05:26.550> more<00:05:26.760> of<00:05:26.790> a

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
pretty easily it's just more of a

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.780 
pretty easily it's just more of a
finding<00:05:27.630> him<00:05:27.810> to<00:05:27.960> begin<00:05:28.110> with<00:05:28.260> so<00:05:28.740> that<00:05:29.310> was

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
finding him to begin with so that was

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.520 
finding him to begin with so that was
pretty<00:05:30.030> simple<00:05:30.210> now<00:05:30.540> was<00:05:30.810> this<00:05:30.990> grind<00:05:31.320> really

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
pretty simple now was this grind really

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.350 
pretty simple now was this grind really
worth<00:05:31.860> it<00:05:32.040> as<00:05:32.160> the<00:05:32.280> S<00:05:32.400> attack<00:05:32.700> even<00:05:32.940> really

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
worth it as the S attack even really

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.680 
worth it as the S attack even really
that<00:05:33.540> good<00:05:33.810> and<00:05:34.080> you<00:05:34.470> know<00:05:34.560> honestly<00:05:35.150> I<00:05:36.150> guess

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
that good and you know honestly I guess

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.900 
that good and you know honestly I guess
it's<00:05:37.140> not<00:05:37.320> it's<00:05:37.620> not<00:05:37.710> a<00:05:37.770> bad<00:05:38.100> pistol<00:05:38.610> I<00:05:38.730> mean

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
it's not it's not a bad pistol I mean

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.310 
it's not it's not a bad pistol I mean
it's<00:05:39.060> nice<00:05:39.270> to<00:05:39.480> be<00:05:39.600> able<00:05:39.720> to<00:05:39.960> have<00:05:40.110> more

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
it's nice to be able to have more

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.980 
it's nice to be able to have more
variety<00:05:40.890> but<00:05:41.700> it<00:05:41.820> definitely<00:05:42.210> was<00:05:42.480> not<00:05:42.510> worth

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
variety but it definitely was not worth

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.659 
variety but it definitely was not worth
the<00:05:43.020> grind<00:05:43.470> I'm<00:05:43.650> gonna<00:05:43.830> be<00:05:43.950> honest<00:05:44.370> I<00:05:44.550> mean

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
the grind I'm gonna be honest I mean

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:46.880 
the grind I'm gonna be honest I mean
it's<00:05:44.850> simply<00:05:45.180> a<00:05:45.300> silenced<00:05:46.020> 1911<00:05:46.740> with<00:05:46.860> a

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
it's simply a silenced 1911 with a

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:47.659 
it's simply a silenced 1911 with a
flashlight

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
flashlight

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:49.159 
flashlight
and<00:05:47.820> I<00:05:48.150> don't<00:05:48.210> even<00:05:48.390> use<00:05:48.720> the<00:05:48.930> flashlight

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169 
and I don't even use the flashlight

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:50.750 
and I don't even use the flashlight
pistols<00:05:49.770> that<00:05:49.830> much<00:05:50.100> they're<00:05:50.310> only<00:05:50.460> really

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
pistols that much they're only really

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.730 
pistols that much they're only really
good<00:05:51.120> on<00:05:51.240> a<00:05:51.270> couple<00:05:51.690> of<00:05:51.780> maps<00:05:52.020> like<00:05:52.380> Turan

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
good on a couple of maps like Turan

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.180 
good on a couple of maps like Turan
highway<00:05:53.160> perhaps<00:05:53.669> maybe<00:05:54.500> you<00:05:55.500> know<00:05:55.620> maps<00:05:56.040> like

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
highway perhaps maybe you know maps like

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.280 
highway perhaps maybe you know maps like
Grand<00:05:56.490> Bazaar<00:05:56.640> Metro<00:05:57.540> is<00:05:57.600> a<00:05:57.720> really<00:05:57.960> good<00:05:58.080> map

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.290 
Grand Bazaar Metro is a really good map

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.500 
Grand Bazaar Metro is a really good map
for<00:05:58.500> flashlights<00:05:58.980> we<00:05:59.820> all<00:05:59.910> know<00:06:00.120> that<00:06:00.300> we've

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 
for flashlights we all know that we've

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.900 
for flashlights we all know that we've
known<00:06:00.690> that<00:06:00.720> since<00:06:01.110> the<00:06:01.230> Alpha<00:06:01.650> but<00:06:01.860> I<00:06:02.190> think

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
known that since the Alpha but I think

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.520 
known that since the Alpha but I think
for<00:06:03.030> the<00:06:03.120> most<00:06:03.300> part<00:06:03.450> this<00:06:03.780> is<00:06:03.960> really<00:06:04.260> not

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
for the most part this is really not

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.010 
for the most part this is really not
that<00:06:04.590> not<00:06:05.250> that<00:06:05.430> groundbreaking<00:06:05.850> it<00:06:06.300> was<00:06:06.480> it

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
that not that groundbreaking it was it

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.630 
that not that groundbreaking it was it
was<00:06:07.169> not<00:06:07.320> worth<00:06:07.590> the<00:06:07.620> grind<00:06:08.070> I<00:06:08.220> will<00:06:08.370> tell<00:06:08.580> you

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:08.640 
was not worth the grind I will tell you

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.670 
was not worth the grind I will tell you
that<00:06:08.820> much<00:06:09.060> once<00:06:09.840> I<00:06:09.960> finally<00:06:10.200> got<00:06:10.410> it<00:06:10.560> does

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
that much once I finally got it does

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.050 
that much once I finally got it does
like<00:06:10.830> man<00:06:11.010> I<00:06:11.040> don't<00:06:11.190> really<00:06:11.490> know<00:06:11.640> what<00:06:11.850> I<00:06:11.880> was

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
like man I don't really know what I was

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.600 
like man I don't really know what I was
expecting<00:06:12.210> it's<00:06:12.840> just<00:06:13.050> a<00:06:13.290> silenced<00:06:13.770> 1911<00:06:14.460> with

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
expecting it's just a silenced 1911 with

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.100 
expecting it's just a silenced 1911 with
a<00:06:14.640> flashlight<00:06:14.940> on<00:06:15.150> the<00:06:15.360> front<00:06:15.600> but<00:06:15.780> I<00:06:15.810> guess<00:06:15.960> if

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
a flashlight on the front but I guess if

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.170 
a flashlight on the front but I guess if
you<00:06:16.200> like<00:06:16.410> tactical<00:06:17.190> weapons<00:06:17.550> like<00:06:17.760> this<00:06:17.940> I

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
you like tactical weapons like this I

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.930 
you like tactical weapons like this I
guess<00:06:18.390> this<00:06:18.630> is<00:06:18.780> a<00:06:18.810> a<00:06:19.260> nice<00:06:20.040> weapon<00:06:20.460> for<00:06:20.640> you<00:06:20.730> it

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
guess this is a a nice weapon for you it

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.120 
guess this is a a nice weapon for you it
is<00:06:21.090> a<00:06:21.120> nice<00:06:21.390> change<00:06:21.450> of<00:06:21.840> pace<00:06:21.900> if<00:06:22.230> you<00:06:22.380> want<00:06:22.650> a<00:06:22.830> a

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.130 
is a nice change of pace if you want a a

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.700 
is a nice change of pace if you want a a
silenced<00:06:23.880> 1911<00:06:24.510> with<00:06:24.630> a<00:06:24.660> flashlight<00:06:24.960> so<00:06:25.470> it<00:06:25.620> is

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
silenced 1911 with a flashlight so it is

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.640 
silenced 1911 with a flashlight so it is
the<00:06:25.919> only<00:06:26.310> one<00:06:26.490> of<00:06:26.610> its<00:06:26.730> kind<00:06:27.110> I'm<00:06:28.110> a<00:06:28.230> big<00:06:28.470> fan

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:28.650 
the only one of its kind I'm a big fan

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.800 
the only one of its kind I'm a big fan
of<00:06:28.680> the<00:06:28.830> 1911<00:06:29.460> to<00:06:29.520> begin<00:06:29.760> with<00:06:29.940> so<00:06:30.180> I<00:06:30.390> guess

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
of the 1911 to begin with so I guess

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:31.880 
of the 1911 to begin with so I guess
it's<00:06:30.990> nice<00:06:31.169> to<00:06:31.410> have<00:06:31.560> three<00:06:31.860> different

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:31.890 
it's nice to have three different

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.700 
it's nice to have three different
versions<00:06:32.400> of<00:06:32.640> the<00:06:32.760> 1911<00:06:33.390> and<00:06:33.810> hey<00:06:34.140> it<00:06:34.410> is<00:06:34.530> the

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
versions of the 1911 and hey it is the

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.469 
versions of the 1911 and hey it is the
only<00:06:34.919> pistol<00:06:35.490> in<00:06:35.580> the<00:06:35.610> game<00:06:35.880> that<00:06:36.090> comes<00:06:36.300> with

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 
only pistol in the game that comes with

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:38.930 
only pistol in the game that comes with
a<00:06:36.510> suppressor<00:06:37.110> and<00:06:37.289> a<00:06:37.830> flashlight<00:06:38.160> so<00:06:38.700> I<00:06:38.729> guess

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 
a suppressor and a flashlight so I guess

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.320 
a suppressor and a flashlight so I guess
that<00:06:39.120> is<00:06:39.270> something<00:06:39.300> that<00:06:39.690> kind

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
that is something that kind

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.960 
that is something that kind
sets<00:06:40.539> it<00:06:40.689> apart<00:06:40.810> from<00:06:41.050> the<00:06:41.289> group<00:06:41.789> you<00:06:42.789> but

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:42.970 
sets it apart from the group you but

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.339 
sets it apart from the group you but
it's<00:06:43.150> kind<00:06:43.330> of<00:06:43.360> counterproductive<00:06:43.720> you<00:06:44.169> think

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:44.349 
it's kind of counterproductive you think

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:45.659 
it's kind of counterproductive you think
about<00:06:44.530> it<00:06:44.650> because<00:06:44.830> the<00:06:44.979> idea<00:06:45.520> of<00:06:45.580> a

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:45.669 
about it because the idea of a

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:47.429 
about it because the idea of a
suppressor<00:06:46.180> is<00:06:46.270> to<00:06:46.389> be<00:06:46.509> stealthy<00:06:46.990> but<00:06:47.229> a

00:06:47.429 --> 00:06:47.439 
suppressor is to be stealthy but a

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:49.850 
suppressor is to be stealthy but a
flashlight<00:06:47.770> basically<00:06:48.490> just<00:06:48.639> gives<00:06:48.849> you<00:06:48.969> away

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 
flashlight basically just gives you away

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.899 
flashlight basically just gives you away
kind<00:06:50.860> of<00:06:50.949> weird<00:06:51.129> to<00:06:51.280> think<00:06:51.490> about<00:06:51.699> it's<00:06:51.849> like

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:51.909 
kind of weird to think about it's like

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:53.760 
kind of weird to think about it's like
okay<00:06:52.270> there's<00:06:52.509> not<00:06:52.659> much<00:06:52.930> tactical<00:06:53.289> miss

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:53.770 
okay there's not much tactical miss

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.429 
okay there's not much tactical miss
behind<00:06:54.219> the<00:06:54.430> test<00:06:54.759> at<00:06:55.030> 1911<00:06:55.719> it<00:06:55.870> seems<00:06:56.080> to<00:06:56.319> be

00:06:56.429 --> 00:06:56.439 
behind the test at 1911 it seems to be

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:58.709 
behind the test at 1911 it seems to be
less<00:06:56.800> than<00:06:56.979> tactical<00:06:57.460> but<00:06:57.729> anyways<00:06:58.449> I<00:06:58.479> hope

00:06:58.709 --> 00:06:58.719 
less than tactical but anyways I hope

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:00.300 
less than tactical but anyways I hope
