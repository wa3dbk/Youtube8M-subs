not drugstore products just like these

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.660 
not drugstore products just like these
are<00:03:58.480> so<00:03:58.870> I<00:03:59.079> am<00:03:59.410> very<00:03:59.680> disappointed<00:04:00.370> about<00:04:00.519> that

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670

as<00:04:01.269> far<00:04:01.810> as<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:02.079> nail<00:04:02.260> polish<00:04:02.739> and<00:04:02.920> the<00:04:03.100> Dove

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
goes in the bird species I think that's

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.199 
goes in the bird species I think that's
great<00:04:05.650> I<00:04:05.920> think<00:04:06.280> that<00:04:06.489> it's<00:04:06.730> awesome<00:04:07.180> that

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
great I think that it's awesome that

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.090 
great I think that it's awesome that

as for you know the deluxe sized samples
i<00:04:11.769> really<00:04:12.069> feel<00:04:12.340> that<00:04:12.400> they<00:04:12.940> should<00:04:12.970> be

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389 
i really feel that they should be

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:15.509 
i really feel that they should be
higher-end<00:04:13.989> products<00:04:14.440> and<00:04:14.769> i'm<00:04:15.160> just<00:04:15.400> not

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
higher-end products and i'm just not

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.279

receiving<00:04:15.970> that<00:04:16.090> in<00:04:16.299> this<00:04:16.479> box<00:04:16.750> so<00:04:17.109> i'm

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
receiving that in this box so i'm

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:18.840
