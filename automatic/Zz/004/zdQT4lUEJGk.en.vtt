00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.780
 Belarus freestyle wrestling team 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.080
 European Championship bow was Slavic 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.690
 what's surprising here 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.530
 You ask, but what in this sport we have 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.080
 we have long been the first legionnaires from 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.500
 Dagestan class gathered anya and 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.160
 Azerbaijan but a few hours before 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.300
 departure the head coach called absolutely 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.609
 another in wear ostap for the fire option 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:23.529
 shame there weren't a couple of medals 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.600
 guys won well what really 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.500
 going on in the team this matter 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.800
 dad lipetskaya wondered 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.480
 in the championship of Europe wrestlers wrestlers 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.570
 performed quite decent especially 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.250
 given the circumstances 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.710
 departure to baku 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.700
 two bronze medals warms the soul 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.710
 290 six kilograms bout for the third 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.630
 the victory went to the young 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.220
 Alexey Dubkov category up to a hundred 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.850
 twenty 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.760
 Alexey Shamarov also with bronze 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.530
 nice that guys have light eyed 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.489
 brown hair our performance 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.780
 leaders Dagestanis nothing to say so 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.140
 how they just didn't go for 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.320
 the continental forum mean with 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.969
 the first numbers in the lists counted 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.360
 on them very much 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.570
 just what are the moments and backstage 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.130
 they are incomprehensible 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.190
 and therefore 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.120
 in no way upset and 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.450
 hoped that we don't care anyway 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.570
 prices we have to compete with no 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.050
 the team of the first with the second singer 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.450
 never mind 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.780
 Of course, Hajiyev Batyrov Gaidar is higher 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.580
 rode and have an excuse 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.310
 what happened and even help bad 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.929
 health condition too 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:30.569
 because the first numbers were trained 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:32.369
 for the championship of Europe will be vigilant 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.280
 supervision of doctors personally I 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.409
 however the proverb irreplaceable is not in 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.380
 this case has become doubly young 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.780
 lack of letters 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.850
 It turned out that I also did not select criteria 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.000
 As a rule, they did not pass completely yet 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 that he was behind the backs of the first second numbers 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.780
 but 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.670
 our management gave them such 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.570
 opportunity gave them 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.520
 m chance and i didn't use 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.659
 sure enough there is a gun doing 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.130
 bet on this composition of course old men 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.720
 traditionally investment 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.590
 but we hope that our youth will show 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.230
 yourself also upcoming 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.709
 world championships 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.549
 and most importantly it is the olympic games 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.689
 women's team picked up the medal 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:21.359
 batches starting day on the initiative 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:23.029
 became the owner 

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:25.560
 bronze weight up to 67 kilograms 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.239
 Although Oleg Martynenko could 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.620
 fight for gold we come up this time 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.900
 very well come up and in general 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.609
 when it was concluded 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:37.389
 so nearly men had enough i won 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:38.429
 first period 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:41.429
 second, I don't know what the first period is to me 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.309
 necessarily 

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:46.839
 and today Azerbaijan we knew it and ulcers 

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:48.669
 that I am generally in these minutes of the third 

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:49.519
 period 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.989
 clinch because we knew that events 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.530
 Sberbank shares fight 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.589
 for living 

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:57.849
 don't remember hard 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.379
 confront the Azerbaijanis 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.290
 really very hard on their careers 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.950
 almost impossible however 30 year old 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.060
 Alexander Pekin in the Greco Roman final 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.469
 Forum did not leave a chance 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:10.119
 master sent to the troops and him and when 

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:12.129
 this is a golden award 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.089
 I want to say that a man is growing strongly 

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:16.669
 plant 24 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:20.899
 but in women 25 7 but in women on her as in 

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:23.899
 affect and more so peculiar 

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:27.159
 specifics earlier 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.379
 27 to 37, that's such a delay 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.239
 so winnings with normal age 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.239
 it can reveal the strongest 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.609
 can get to Europe at the Olympics 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.269
 often even percentage protocol these tips 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.389
 you of this european championship tula 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:44.949
 that I am a country that will 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:47.549

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.139
 one country is 8 3 medals of different 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.019
 dignity is not something that there is from how it was before 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.139
 Ukrainian summer 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.129
 there are three champions of this Russian 3 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:59.179
 there are many champions and prize-winners 

00:03:59.179 --> 00:04:00.839
 at the European Championship the Belarusians won 

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:03.729
 five medals in three kinds of fight point in 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:05.089
 put a list of young nails 

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:06.169
 Vinnichenko 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.139
 weight up to 96 kilograms won silver 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.079
 Greco Roman style wrestling award 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:12.869

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:14.400
 olympic licenses 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.430
 Traditionally all kinds of wrestling favors 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.799
 one frame so there are Belarusians and 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.430
 what to strive for and whom to equal
