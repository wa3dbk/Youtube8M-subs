00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
Pina suffered an ankle injury which took

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.950 
Pina suffered an ankle injury which took
a<00:00:14.309> major<00:00:14.549> up<00:00:14.790> because<00:00:15.030> he<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.420> one<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.750> best

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
a major up because he is one of the best

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.560 
a major up because he is one of the best
left<00:00:16.220> midfield<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.369> not<00:00:18.029> just<00:00:18.210> for<00:00:18.240> everything

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
left midfield is not just for everything

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.939 
left midfield is not just for everything
I<00:00:18.630> think<00:00:18.810> probably<00:00:19.080> in<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.410> league<00:00:19.619> as<00:00:19.770> well

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
I think probably in the league as well

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.450 
I think probably in the league as well

fourth of the moment champions league
spot<00:04:23.660> I<00:04:24.110> think<00:04:24.710> that's<00:04:24.800> pretty<00:04:24.919> realistic

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
spot I think that's pretty realistic

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:26.200 
spot I think that's pretty realistic
because<00:04:25.550> that<00:04:25.820> is<00:04:25.940> what

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
because that is what

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.790 
because that is what
it<00:04:26.389> pretty<00:04:26.840> much<00:04:26.930> is<00:04:27.020> in<00:04:27.229> their<00:04:27.380> life<00:04:27.530> right

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
it pretty much is in their life right

it pretty much is in their life right
now<00:04:27.949> we<00:04:28.190> are<00:04:28.220> second<00:04:28.850> but<00:04:29.479> we<00:04:29.569> hadn't<00:04:29.750> played

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.270 
now we are second but we hadn't played
Wigan<00:04:30.169> yet<00:04:30.289> but<00:04:30.560> hopefully<00:04:30.650> we<00:04:30.860> can<00:04:30.949> get<00:04:31.039> a<00:04:31.100> few

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
Wigan yet but hopefully we can get a few

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.159 
Wigan yet but hopefully we can get a few
points<00:04:31.610> and<00:04:31.759> yeah<00:04:32.660> instead<00:04:32.900> of<00:04:32.960> playing

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169
