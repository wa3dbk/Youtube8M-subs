00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:07.839
 hello friends I have the new version of 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.910
 melon always the 1.8 point 1 as you see 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:12.759
 there is a configuration on this plane 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:16.510
 adds the other and this is just the new 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:19.600
 of taking out is for sale but they passed it to 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.370
 mediafire and then from there the download of 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.010
 rum with beautiful kraft and if you know him 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:27.070
 showing us what commented and red crafter 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.980
 he got it because the counter raised it 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.170
 to buy it this raised it on average 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.180
 for example feet but I do not want 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:37.660
 say well as in this is a new 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.270
 setting the distance bar 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.460
 here as you see they are four no matter 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.040
 the device and if the bike g sugar 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.860
 here 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.290
 being a corporal throughout understand 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:56.320
 here is a new configuration this 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:58.900
 also something new that they could and he 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.930
 is who now if you put your corner on 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.760
 curtain to be able to see he writes how I started 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.670
 but the server 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.280
 for example crazy hunger if in the 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.530
 fire of hunger I believe that there is more 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.190
 possibility of there because good commented 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:18.390
 monsters or droid that he did locally 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.800
 done then at least I did not enter 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.810
 as you see here I will put all the 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.350
 configurations not to a command I did not get married 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.180
 as before environment yes and well this 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.930
 it's the new thing that I added to the bar 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.759
 of configuration the skins because there 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.210
 another shortly after you have to have them and 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.159
 have this application 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.600
 and now there are also some modes that 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.060
 they take for example a mount what 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.340
 they grabbed example let's try some 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.470
 that we have saved I do not know we will try x 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.750
 which is one of the other version or 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.659
 where none now that 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.719
 downloaded in this time 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.579
 I do not know could be the money in 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:05.069
 human steps or I do not know what we are going to see 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:08.099
 here we are going to put the clock we're going 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:12.750
 to put one that does not eat rice 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:15.629
 good would be the ruiz are the wheels and 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.910
 may be the ruins we are going to put the 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:20.820
 ruins 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:25.550
 and now I would charge the ruin as you see 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:29.280
 will put here that if it was william waters 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.080
 and then let's put x world but one 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.770
 that I can fix example I want 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.430
 to ruin 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.430
 one 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:44.760
 as it was I would sing the structure as you see 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:47.930
 here the structure that this is another other 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.930
 of structures I was wrong 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.870
 let's put a long 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.870
 for example 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:06.650
 This has a lot of because I do not 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.720
 agreement that I made good so let's see 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.500
 let's look for structures has white 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.500
 no no 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.380
 let's find a structure 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:26.200
 and good good 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:28.150
 well I think that we are not followed 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.690
 structures or there's no here I do not know 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.690
 we will try 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.180
 good 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.620
 A) Yes 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:43.370
 that's weird but the joke is that that 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:47.420
 some spin of ice montilla grab 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:50.370
 some way let's try and do for 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.690
 try let's try 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:58.020
 and I think I have it saved here 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:01.410
 normal review mode 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.270
 they do not pay us more to be to see if they do not 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.760
 they believe me and that's how I grow 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.850
 we asked is that he did not grab me 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.810
 see if he grabs us and grabs them 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:16.049
 means that if the modest ones arrive 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:18.620
 how to see he had the nickname this one would put 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.620
 the anvil 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.740
 there all the swords are going to put us 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.740
 pe 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.240
 mounts 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.560
 sorry the one that I am in you 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:48.750
 As you can see we have not been created so 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:50.640
 less general water etc. 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.000
 Carlos for water has not tried it with 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.000
 no one 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.870
 raising the other 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:08.860
 as they see with water 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:15.189
 with that sense 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:22.400
 how 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.400
 okay 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.590
 I think it happens to me 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:40.280
 these videos like if you want them to 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.259
 put this mode on the video link in 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.750
 the other one I'm going to do now if they want me 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:46.610
 do the review in this way and the 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.370
 they leave to write I started I do not have to 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:52.610
 I will not leave in the description ebro 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:55.400
 white 1.8 point 1 2 per million again 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:58.900
