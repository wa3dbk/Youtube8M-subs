00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.469 
that maybe they all started stacking up
it's<00:01:40.069> hard<00:01:40.220> to<00:01:40.310> say<00:01:40.490> that<00:01:40.520> you<00:01:41.179> know<00:01:41.270> Tony

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
it's hard to say that you know Tony

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:42.760 
it's hard to say that you know Tony
Stewart<00:01:41.869> couldn't<00:01:42.229> get<00:01:42.319> some<00:01:42.500> help<00:01:42.619> from<00:01:42.679> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
hon Dre maybe even further back then

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.940 
hon Dre maybe even further back then
then<00:01:45.000> right<00:01:45.450> behind<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.930> like<00:01:46.650> you're<00:01:46.710> always

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
then right behind you like you're always

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.010 
then right behind you like you're always
kind<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.280> stacking<00:01:47.549> up<00:01:47.820> yeah

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.300 

what<00:01:53.020> you've<00:01:53.170> been<00:01:53.259> doing<00:01:53.710> right<00:01:54.009> there<00:01:54.159> you

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
what you've been doing right there you

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.709 
what you've been doing right there you
might<00:01:54.460> have<00:01:54.549> been<00:01:54.640> wide<00:01:54.880> open<00:01:55.210> at<00:01:55.329> that<00:01:55.479> time

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
might have been wide open at that time

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:57.209 
might have been wide open at that time
and<00:01:56.049> then<00:01:56.170> all<00:01:56.320> of<00:01:56.350> a<00:01:56.439> sudden<00:01:56.500> things<00:01:56.890> change

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219 
and then all of a sudden things change

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:59.130 
and then all of a sudden things change
and<00:01:57.460> so<00:01:57.640> yeah<00:01:58.060> you<00:01:58.119> can't<00:01:58.509> put<00:01:58.719> any<00:01:58.869> blame<00:01:59.110> on

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
and so yeah you can't put any blame on

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.630 
and so yeah you can't put any blame on
anybody<00:01:59.590> able<00:01:59.740> to<00:01:59.860> think<00:02:00.039> here<00:02:00.219> although<00:02:00.520> I

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
anybody able to think here although I

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.190 
anybody able to think here although I
think<00:02:00.880> we<00:02:01.149> do<00:02:01.240> see<00:02:01.420> a<00:02:01.450> little<00:02:01.689> contact<00:02:02.020> between

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
think we do see a little contact between

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.889 
think we do see a little contact between
the<00:02:02.500> 33<00:02:02.920> and<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.070> 5<00:02:03.280> but<00:02:03.729> when<00:02:04.360> he<00:02:04.479> pulls<00:02:04.689> out

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
the 33 and the 5 but when he pulls out

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.899 
the 33 and the 5 but when he pulls out
there<00:02:05.200> that<00:02:05.590> car<00:02:05.799> is<00:02:05.920> automatically<00:02:06.460> going<00:02:06.820> to

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
there that car is automatically going to

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.370 
there that car is automatically going to
start<00:02:07.390> coming<00:02:07.600> back<00:02:07.750> a<00:02:07.869> little<00:02:08.080> bit<00:02:08.200> because

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
start coming back a little bit because

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.220 
start coming back a little bit because
he's<00:02:08.709> come<00:02:08.920> out<00:02:08.950> against<00:02:09.489> a<00:02:09.869> brick<00:02:10.869> wall<00:02:10.899> of

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
he's come out against a brick wall of

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.720 
he's come out against a brick wall of
wind<00:02:11.500> right<00:02:11.769> there<00:02:12.010> even<00:02:12.250> though<00:02:12.340> he's<00:02:12.519> got<00:02:12.670> a

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
wind right there even though he's got a

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.699 
wind right there even though he's got a
run<00:02:13.030> that<00:02:13.420> car<00:02:13.630> automatically<00:02:14.230> slows<00:02:14.470> down

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
run that car automatically slows down

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.110 
run that car automatically slows down
when<00:02:14.890> he<00:02:14.980> pulls<00:02:15.190> out<00:02:15.340> there<00:02:15.550> until<00:02:15.640> he<00:02:15.849> starts

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
when he pulls out there until he starts

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.670
