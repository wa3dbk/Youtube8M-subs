00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:19.660 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.910 

which<00:06:20.660> I<00:06:20.840> think<00:06:20.870> those<00:06:21.260> are<00:06:21.470> pretty<00:06:21.650> expensive

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:21.920 
which I think those are pretty expensive

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.270 
which I think those are pretty expensive
but<00:06:22.810> you<00:06:23.810> can<00:06:23.990> use<00:06:24.200> those<00:06:24.440> and<00:06:24.710> anything<00:06:25.130> other

but you can use those and anything other

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.210 
but you can use those and anything other
for<00:06:25.580> one<00:06:25.760> because<00:06:26.420> you<00:06:26.690> can<00:06:26.930> actually

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 
for one because you can actually

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:35.350 
for one because you can actually
attached<00:06:28.220> offer<00:06:28.610> impact<00:06:29.360> together<00:06:34.240> and<00:06:35.240> we

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 
attached offer impact together and we

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:42.240 
attached offer impact together and we
had<00:06:35.570> a<00:06:35.950> compression<00:06:36.950> fitting<00:06:37.370> there<00:06:39.040> well<00:06:40.240> so

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.250 
had a compression fitting there well so

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.170 
had a compression fitting there well so
there's<00:06:43.250> our<00:06:43.550> final<00:06:44.420> jump<00:06:44.960> on<00:06:45.140> our<00:06:45.290> packs<00:06:45.590> and

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
there's our final jump on our packs and

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.820 
there's our final jump on our packs and
we<00:06:47.180> got<00:06:47.360> running<00:06:47.660> that<00:06:47.780> galvanized<00:06:48.320> line<00:06:48.590> it

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
we got running that galvanized line it
