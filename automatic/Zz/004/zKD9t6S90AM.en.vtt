I'd<00:02:30.280> say<00:02:31.140> in<00:02:32.140> Reverse<00:02:35.940> it's<00:02:36.940> about<00:02:37.060> 3/4<00:02:37.570> of<00:02:37.690> a

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
I'd say in Reverse it's about 3/4 of a

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.480 
I'd say in Reverse it's about 3/4 of a
cube<00:02:38.230> e<00:02:38.320> which<00:02:38.680> is<00:02:38.709> pretty<00:02:39.070> good

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
cube e which is pretty good

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.660 
cube e which is pretty good

Diane you don't really see Diane making
unique<00:03:11.620> puzzles<00:03:12.390> usually<00:03:13.390> just<00:03:13.540> see<00:03:13.630> them

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
unique puzzles usually just see them

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.100 
unique puzzles usually just see them
making<00:03:13.989> three<00:03:14.170> by<00:03:14.290> threes<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:15.400> megaminx<00:03:16.330> but

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
making three by threes and megaminx but

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.190 
making three by threes and megaminx but
here<00:03:17.350> is<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.709> Diane<00:03:18.130> wheel<00:03:18.670> of<00:03:19.090> wisdom<00:03:19.540> this

here is the Diane wheel of wisdom this

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.710 
here is the Diane wheel of wisdom this
is<00:03:20.640> definitely<00:03:21.640> gonna<00:03:21.850> make<00:03:21.940> it<00:03:22.209> into<00:03:22.360> one<00:03:22.660> of

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
is definitely gonna make it into one of

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:30.930 
is definitely gonna make it into one of
the<00:03:22.780> top<00:03:24.269> five<00:03:25.269> publish<00:03:25.980> on<00:03:26.980> my<00:03:27.100> list<00:03:29.700> it<00:03:30.700> comes

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
the top five publish on my list it comes

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.580 
the top five publish on my list it comes
in<00:03:31.090> a<00:03:31.120> plastic<00:03:31.269> bag<00:03:31.690> here's<00:03:32.170> what<00:03:32.380> it<00:03:32.470> looks

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
in a plastic bag here's what it looks

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.900 
in a plastic bag here's what it looks
like<00:03:32.769> right<00:03:33.070> out<00:03:33.220> of<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.400> box<00:03:35.730> alright<00:03:36.730> so<00:03:36.880> I

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
like right out of the box alright so I

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.460 
like right out of the box alright so I
was<00:03:37.060> not<00:03:37.209> able<00:03:37.390> to<00:03:37.570> do<00:03:37.660> that<00:03:37.750> no<00:03:37.870> one<00:03:37.959> take<00:03:38.200> but

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
was not able to do that no one take but

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.650 
was not able to do that no one take but
anyways<00:03:38.800> here<00:03:39.400> is<00:03:39.580> the<00:03:39.790> Diane<00:03:40.060> will<00:03:40.239> of<00:03:40.330> wisdom

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
anyways here is the Diane will of wisdom

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.470 
anyways here is the Diane will of wisdom
house<00:03:41.620> he<00:03:41.739> could<00:03:41.830> see<00:03:42.100> the<00:03:42.820> wheel<00:03:43.000> will<00:03:43.360> be

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
house he could see the wheel will be

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.250 
house he could see the wheel will be
able<00:03:43.600> to<00:03:43.750> turn<00:03:44.019> this<00:03:44.769> I<00:03:45.100> assume<00:03:45.880> so<00:03:46.360> and<00:03:46.780> also

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
able to turn this I assume so and also

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.420 
able to turn this I assume so and also
it'll<00:03:47.530> be<00:03:47.620> able<00:03:47.769> to<00:03:47.830> move<00:03:47.920> I<00:03:48.040> have<00:03:48.160> three<00:03:48.310> by

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
it'll be able to move I have three by

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.660 
it'll be able to move I have three by
three<00:03:48.670> so<00:03:49.390> let's<00:03:49.660> take<00:03:49.930> a<00:03:50.140> look<00:03:50.530> at<00:03:50.769> this<00:03:51.370> point

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
three so let's take a look at this point

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.699 
three so let's take a look at this point
turning<00:03:52.080> does<00:03:53.080> it<00:03:53.200> turn<00:03:53.440> it<00:03:53.860> does<00:03:54.540> and<00:03:55.709> it's

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
turning does it turn it does and it's

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.660 
turning does it turn it does and it's
not<00:03:56.980> that<00:03:57.310> great<00:03:57.700> a<00:03:58.680> little<00:03:59.680> rough<00:04:00.040> to<00:04:00.400> turn

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
not that great a little rough to turn

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.070 
not that great a little rough to turn
but<00:04:01.769> still<00:04:02.769> it's<00:04:02.920> awesome<00:04:03.489> and<00:04:03.700> then<00:04:04.600> the<00:04:04.750> 3x3

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
but still it's awesome and then the 3x3

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.880 
but still it's awesome and then the 3x3
turning<00:04:06.810> is<00:04:07.810> a<00:04:07.870> little<00:04:08.200> bit<00:04:08.290> smoother<00:04:08.709> but

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
turning is a little bit smoother but

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.990 
turning is a little bit smoother but
pieces<00:04:09.340> are<00:04:09.489> catching<00:04:10.950> there<00:04:11.950> must<00:04:12.100> be<00:04:12.220> a<00:04:12.579> lot

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
pieces are catching there must be a lot

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.589 
pieces are catching there must be a lot
of<00:04:13.150> pieces<00:04:13.750> for<00:04:14.200> this

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:14.599 
of pieces for this

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.840 
of pieces for this
public<00:04:15.110> to<00:04:15.230> work<00:04:15.470> I'm<00:04:16.280> guessing<00:04:16.639> a<00:04:16.699> lot<00:04:16.790> of

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
public to work I'm guessing a lot of

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.759 
public to work I'm guessing a lot of
internal<00:04:17.359> pieces<00:04:17.660> that<00:04:17.840> I'm<00:04:17.930> probably<00:04:18.139> not

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
internal pieces that I'm probably not

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.590 
internal pieces that I'm probably not
going<00:04:18.979> to<00:04:21.010> disassemble<00:04:22.010> this<00:04:22.130> but<00:04:22.880> there's

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
going to disassemble this but there's

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.590 
going to disassemble this but there's
one<00:04:23.780> turn<00:04:23.960> II<00:04:24.020> could<00:04:24.169> do<00:04:24.290> followed<00:04:24.949> by<00:04:25.540> and<00:04:26.540> you

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
one turn II could do followed by and you

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.360 
one turn II could do followed by and you
don't<00:04:26.750> have<00:04:26.870> to<00:04:27.050> do<00:04:27.199> a<00:04:27.229> 90<00:04:27.860> degree<00:04:28.100> or<00:04:28.130> 45

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
don't have to do a 90 degree or 45

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.730 
don't have to do a 90 degree or 45
degree<00:04:29.470> or<00:04:30.470> you<00:04:30.650> do<00:04:30.830> 245<00:04:31.699> but<00:04:32.000> then<00:04:32.590> you<00:04:33.590> mess

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
degree or you do 245 but then you mess

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.150 
degree or you do 245 but then you mess
it<00:04:33.770> up<00:04:33.919> like<00:04:34.100> that<00:04:34.130> and<00:04:35.229> then<00:04:36.229> you<00:04:36.830> can<00:04:36.979> do<00:04:37.130> it

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
it up like that and then you can do it

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.140 
it up like that and then you can do it
again

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.879 

and<00:04:41.150> I<00:04:41.210> can<00:04:41.360> get<00:04:41.479> pretty<00:04:41.750> messed<00:04:41.960> up<00:04:42.169> pretty

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
and I can get pretty messed up pretty

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.090 
and I can get pretty messed up pretty
fast<00:04:43.190> so<00:04:43.900> there<00:04:44.900> is<00:04:45.169> the<00:04:45.440> Diana<00:04:45.770> wheel<00:04:45.979> of

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
fast so there is the Diana wheel of

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.520 
fast so there is the Diana wheel of
wisdom<00:04:46.460> I'm<00:04:47.449> not<00:04:47.600> sure<00:04:47.780> if<00:04:47.870> I<00:04:47.960> will<00:04:48.020> scramble

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
wisdom I'm not sure if I will scramble

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.770 
wisdom I'm not sure if I will scramble
this<00:04:48.889> just<00:04:49.160> yet<00:04:49.490> I'm<00:04:49.699> probably<00:04:50.000> gonna<00:04:50.360> try<00:04:50.630> and

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
this just yet I'm probably gonna try and

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.930 
this just yet I'm probably gonna try and

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
figure out some cool things to do it

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.200 
figure out some cool things to do it
that<00:04:53.060> first<00:04:53.330> maybe<00:04:53.690> get<00:04:53.990> a<00:04:55.000> scrambled<00:04:56.000> video

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
that first maybe get a scrambled video

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.520 
that first maybe get a scrambled video
up<00:04:56.330> on<00:04:56.479> my<00:04:56.570> channel<00:04:56.780> when<00:04:57.110> I<00:04:57.139> do<00:04:57.229> end<00:04:57.470> up
