00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
with a lot of force so not only do you

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.240 
with a lot of force so not only do you
run<00:01:04.050> the<00:01:04.110> risk<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.439> just<00:01:04.680> making<00:01:04.890> your<00:01:04.949> sensor

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
run the risk of just making your sensor

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.850 
run the risk of just making your sensor
a<00:01:05.280> lot<00:01:05.460> dirtier<00:01:06.079> you<00:01:07.079> also<00:01:07.290> run<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.590> risk<00:01:07.649> of

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
a lot dirtier you also run the risk of

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.310 
a lot dirtier you also run the risk of
damaging<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.460> itself<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.810> other<00:01:09.840> thing<00:01:10.200> I

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
damaging it itself the other thing I

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.810 
damaging it itself the other thing I
highly<00:01:10.590> recommend<00:01:11.040> but<00:01:11.250> isn't<00:01:11.579> really

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
highly recommend but isn't really

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.780 
highly recommend but isn't really
necessary<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.600> just<00:01:13.079> doing<00:01:13.259> this<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.500> tripod

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
necessary is just doing this on a tripod

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.249 
necessary is just doing this on a tripod
doesn't<00:01:14.790> matter<00:01:15.060> what<00:01:15.210> kind<00:01:15.390> as<00:01:15.930> long<00:01:15.990> as<00:01:16.170> you

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
doesn't matter what kind as long as you

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.950 
doesn't matter what kind as long as you
can<00:01:16.380> tilt<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.649> head<00:01:16.860> down<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:18.060> I'm<00:01:18.570> going<00:01:18.930> to

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
can tilt the head down so I'm going to

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.840 
can tilt the head down so I'm going to
take<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.259> through<00:01:19.590> getting<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.460> ready<00:01:20.579> and

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
greatest depth of field so that when you

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
fire off a few shots you'll be able to

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.539 
fire off a few shots you'll be able to

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
debris left on the lens if there is just

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.849 
debris left on the lens if there is just
repeat<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.549> process<00:03:47.579> until<00:03:48.150> it<00:03:48.299> clears<00:03:48.449> up<00:03:48.859> if

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
repeat the process until it clears up if

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.640

it<00:03:50.639> doesn't<00:03:50.970> clear<00:03:51.180> up<00:03:51.209> and<00:03:51.510> it<00:03:51.900> remains<00:03:52.230> and

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
it doesn't clear up and it remains and

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.759 
it doesn't clear up and it remains and
there's<00:03:52.769> always<00:03:53.069> blotches<00:03:54.199> you<00:03:55.199> can<00:03:55.530> go<00:03:55.739> a

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
there's always blotches you can go a

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.089 
there's always blotches you can go a
step<00:03:55.980> further<00:03:56.190> into<00:03:56.459> a<00:03:56.579> wet<00:03:56.819> cleaning<00:03:57.889> but<00:03:58.889> if

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
step further into a wet cleaning but if

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.080 
step further into a wet cleaning but if
you're<00:03:59.280> uncomfortable<00:03:59.430> with<00:03:59.879> doing

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
you're uncomfortable with doing

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.339 
you're uncomfortable with doing
something<00:04:00.359> like<00:04:00.389> that<00:04:00.659> which<00:04:00.930> is<00:04:00.959> actually

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
something like that which is actually

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:02.869 
something like that which is actually
coming<00:04:01.590> into<00:04:01.709> contact<00:04:01.949> with<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.400> sensor<00:04:02.549> I

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
coming into contact with the sensor I

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.909 
coming into contact with the sensor I
would<00:04:03.449> highly<00:04:03.810> recommend<00:04:03.840> just<00:04:04.319> sending<00:04:04.829> it

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
would highly recommend just sending it

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.129 
would highly recommend just sending it
in<00:04:05.040> for<00:04:05.310> a<00:04:05.340> cleaning<00:04:05.549> it's<00:04:06.060> a<00:04:06.389> lot<00:04:06.690> cheaper<00:04:06.930> to

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
in for a cleaning it's a lot cheaper to

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.020 
in for a cleaning it's a lot cheaper to
just<00:04:07.799> send<00:04:08.040> it<00:04:08.099> and<00:04:08.250> have<00:04:08.370> a<00:04:08.430> professional<00:04:08.730> do

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
just send it and have a professional do

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.909 
just send it and have a professional do
it<00:04:09.060> than<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:09.959> accidentally<00:04:10.440> damage<00:04:10.799> your

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
it than to accidentally damage your

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:12.610 
it than to accidentally damage your
sensor<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:11.519> have<00:04:11.639> to<00:04:11.760> pay<00:04:11.879> for<00:04:11.940> a<00:04:12.150> replacement

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
sensor and have to pay for a replacement

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.229 
sensor and have to pay for a replacement
so<00:04:13.620> that's<00:04:13.889> about<00:04:14.040> it<00:04:14.159> for<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.879> basic

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
so that's about it for the basic

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.789 
so that's about it for the basic
cleaning<00:04:15.540> of<00:04:15.629> your<00:04:15.750> camera<00:04:16.019> sensor<00:04:16.229> if<00:04:16.530> you
