long<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:10.450> measurements<00:00:11.140> are<00:00:11.470> like<00:00:12.250> this<00:00:12.690> I'll

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:13.690 
long the measurements are like this I'll

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:14.610 
long the measurements are like this I'll
go<00:00:13.840> ahead<00:00:13.930> and<00:00:14.110> go<00:00:14.230> over<00:00:14.380> the<00:00:14.470> measurements

look<00:00:52.690> how<00:00:52.810> big<00:00:53.020> their<00:00:53.200> computer<00:00:53.650> to<00:00:53.680> my<00:00:53.860> thumb

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.240 
look how big their computer to my thumb

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.520 
look how big their computer to my thumb
they're<00:00:55.240> about<00:00:55.420> three<00:00:55.660> times<00:00:55.900> the<00:00:56.080> size<00:00:56.260> of

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
they're about three times the size of

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.430 
they're about three times the size of
this<00:00:56.710> small<00:00:56.980> ones<00:00:57.250> of<00:00:57.640> five<00:00:57.940> millimeters<00:00:58.540> very

this small ones of five millimeters very

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.370 
this small ones of five millimeters very
bright<00:01:00.360> I'll<00:01:01.360> shut<00:01:01.660> the<00:01:01.780> lights<00:01:01.930> off<00:01:02.110> so<00:01:02.290> you

like a neon green I did the best I could
on<00:01:06.880> the<00:01:07.060> paint<00:01:07.270> job<00:01:07.510> here's<00:01:08.230> that<00:01:08.409> the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
on the paint job here's that the

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.790 
on the paint job here's that the
underneath<00:01:08.770> looks<00:01:09.070> like<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:10.260> LED<00:01:11.260> lights<00:01:11.500> are

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
underneath looks like the LED lights are

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.660 
underneath looks like the LED lights are
glued<00:01:12.370> in<00:01:12.610> there<00:01:12.840> are<00:01:13.840> some<00:01:14.170> holes<00:01:14.409> that<00:01:15.070> I<00:01:15.130> I

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
glued in there are some holes that I I

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.960 
glued in there are some holes that I I
planned<00:01:16.540> on<00:01:16.840> writing<00:01:17.320> this<00:01:17.530> on<00:01:17.890> my<00:01:18.460> Rustler

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
planned on writing this on my Rustler

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.550 
planned on writing this on my Rustler
with<00:01:19.210> an<00:01:19.330> extension<00:01:19.720> kit<00:01:20.020> but<00:01:20.200> never<00:01:20.380> got

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
with an extension kit but never got

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.180 
with an extension kit but never got
around<00:01:20.590> to<00:01:21.040> it

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
around to it

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.580 
around to it
and<00:01:21.340> then<00:01:21.820> I<00:01:21.850> bought<00:01:22.120> a<00:01:22.150> stampede<00:01:22.810> and<00:01:23.140> I

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
and then I bought a stampede and I

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.649 
and then I bought a stampede and I
drilled<00:01:23.950> the<00:01:24.010> holes<00:01:24.250> for<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:24.550> Stampede<00:01:25.030> but

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
drilled the holes for the Stampede but

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.090 
drilled the holes for the Stampede but
then<00:01:25.810> never<00:01:25.960> used<00:01:26.229> it<00:01:26.380> so<00:01:26.500> there's<00:01:26.680> two<00:01:26.860> holes

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
then never used it so there's two holes

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.610 
then never used it so there's two holes
here<00:01:27.220> two<00:01:28.000> holes<00:01:28.240> here<00:01:28.360> and<00:01:28.930> there<00:01:29.320> there's<00:01:29.530> a

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
here two holes here and there there's a

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.870 
here two holes here and there there's a
hole<00:01:29.799> here<00:01:30.040> and<00:01:30.130> a<00:01:30.190> hole<00:01:30.220> here<00:01:30.490> and<00:01:30.580> a<00:01:30.640> hole<00:01:30.670> in

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
hole here and a hole here and a hole in

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.660 
hole here and a hole here and a hole in
the<00:01:30.940> middle<00:01:31.060> but<00:01:31.920> super<00:01:32.920> cool<00:01:33.070> and<00:01:33.159> custom<00:01:33.520> I

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
the middle but super cool and custom I

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.820 
the middle but super cool and custom I
have<00:01:34.060> a<00:01:34.090> custom<00:01:34.750> toggle<00:01:35.470> switch<00:01:36.360> ran<00:01:37.360> by<00:01:37.830> nine

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
have a custom toggle switch ran by nine

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.310 
have a custom toggle switch ran by nine
volt<00:01:39.100> battery<00:01:39.460> and<00:01:40.049> everything's<00:01:41.049> real

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
volt battery and everything's real

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.469 
volt battery and everything's real
heavy-duty<00:01:41.650> I<00:01:42.070> did<00:01:42.610> a<00:01:42.670> real<00:01:42.820> good<00:01:42.850> job<00:01:43.000> on<00:01:43.210> this

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
heavy-duty I did a real good job on this

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.170 
heavy-duty I did a real good job on this
one<00:01:43.690> and<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:45.520> would<00:01:45.640> probably<00:01:45.729> be<00:01:45.940> the<00:01:46.060> last

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
one and this would probably be the last

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.000 
one and this would probably be the last
body<00:01:46.510> I<00:01:46.659> ever<00:01:46.930> put<00:01:47.200> up<00:01:47.229> for<00:01:47.500> sale<00:01:47.530> because<00:01:47.890> the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
body I ever put up for sale because the

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.649 
body I ever put up for sale because the
rest<00:01:48.340> of<00:01:48.490> them<00:01:48.640> I'm<00:01:48.729> probably<00:01:48.909> gonna<00:01:49.150> use<00:01:49.210> but

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
rest of them I'm probably gonna use but

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.630
