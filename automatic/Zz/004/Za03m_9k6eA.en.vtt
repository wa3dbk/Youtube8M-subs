 buds to loop point at two 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.699
 third parts of sugar 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.000
 flames fed will be added the other 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:53.460
 third part of blue 3 that are clear to 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.859
 Snow point with sugar added to 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.809
 half of assembled and bleached buds 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:59.269
 things in is add sugar too 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.430
 about mounted together with the water 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:06.810
 we will mix half we will add half 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.299
 of the whites now the yolks the whites 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.640
 about to snow with the yolks 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:14.970
 we will proceed to incorporate the flour 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.710
 loose previously sifted the almond 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.470
 ground and orange zest 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.729
 but solid to the elaboration 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.100
 we will proceed to add the other half of 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.470
 the Clares 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.080
 let's have all the ingredients 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.720
 mixed and previously prepared 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.720
 proceed to study the hand with a spatula 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.560
 we have included in the manga we 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.170
 we have a bowl of milk shake 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.900
 biscuits severe a tray previously 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.490
 day with sulfurized paper we have in 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.070
 the shake dish 2 can we 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.619
 proceed to bake the cake I 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.670
 cut will be 200 to 200 degrees during 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.280
 68 minutes 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.409
 is determined in two ways one 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.860
 we press a surface of the sponge cake 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.950
 and seeing that it is back to its form 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.270
 previous or to make sure 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.939
 introducing a needle or a lace 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.250
 inside the cake and seeing that 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.110
 it's come clean we've seen that the 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.330
 biscuit is cooked we proceed to 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.330
 disassembled and the double return of this one 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.189
 once we have made the cake with 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.480
 of almonds we have to elaborate 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:28.280
 the praline cream which consists of 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:32.920
 half a liter of cream 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:36.380
 and 150 grams of industrial praline 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.090
 is to give a little movement to 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.740
 trainer so that the texture is lame 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.940
 adequate 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:46.610
 the whipped cream will incorporate it to three 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.460
 times on the line balancing well 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.680
 its texture 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.290
 incorporated all the cream 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.870
 about trading this is our cream 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.090
 of previously elaborated the sponge cake 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.330
 with almonds and planner cream 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.780
 we will proceed to make a syrup or 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.590
 syrup for each one that is made up of 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.750
 125 grams of sugar half a liter of water 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.310
 a sufficient amount of rum and 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.350
 sufficient amount of aroma that is 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.880
 orange 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.790
 the ingredients in a saucepan 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.610
 we will put to the fire and will pass the time 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.380
 until it cooks up to 101 degrees that 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.180
 it will be a loose syrup which we 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.780
 will serve to set the cake and 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.920
 perform the assembly of the cake 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.080
 elaborated we will proceed to assemble the 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.480
 cake missing the preparation of the 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.970
 glossy chocolate glaze panel 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.970
 we will elaborate while the cake is 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.610
 freeze 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.140
 The first thing we will do is divide 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.260
 three equal portions 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.049
 the cake 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.319
 once we have cut in three the 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:55.060
 sponge cake we will prepare for the 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.909
 assembly of the cake what we will do is 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.980
 place a rectangle of cake on 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:02.400
 a naivety which we do not have at 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.709
 so much we are going to use a table 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.940
 then we will bathe it ocala rhythms 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.430
 with syrup 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.489
 Anibal previously done 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:16.509
 they have not scaled the cake 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:19.239
 and we will incorporate on this the cream of 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:20.660
 I was doing this process for 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.180
 three times 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.400
 we have drawn all the layers you 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.900
 we will give a small layer of cream 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.240
 reality above so that this 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.890
 waterproof and that the glaze I hope 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.320
 bright do not absorb the cake 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.240
 now now let's see it 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.070
 freezer to freeze and we can 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.070
 bathe the at 4025 degrees with the glaze 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.860
 assembled the pie only missing elaborate the 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.950
 super bright chocolate glaze the 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:50.630
 which will we elaborate kong 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:56.600
 of 250 milliliters of water 360 grams of 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:59.510
 sugar 240 milliliters of cream 120 grams 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.300
 of cocoa powder and 6 sheets of gelatin 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.470
 what is equivalent to 12 grams of day 20 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.540
 and treated 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.240
 we want for the preparation of glaze 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:12.470
 will make a syrup next to the 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:16.540
 loose is 105 degrees adding the 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:18.449
 water and sugar and carrying cooking 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.939
 temperature 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:24.020
 Ivan has reached 105 degrees 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:24.020
 we will add the cream 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.400
 and we will quickly remove it with the 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.400
 spatula 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:53.689
 once the cream is organized 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.210
 and we will add 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.210
 gelatin 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.340
 which is we will cover 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:11.850
 and we will place on the reality with tin 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.680
 and without moving with it with the spatula 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:17.020
 because if it would not stick in the 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:20.490
 spatula we let it thin 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:22.800
 once we have incorporated the gelatin 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:26.069
 we will also incorporate cocoa powder 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:29.060
 in its entirety and we will remove until 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:29.060
 get a 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:35.500
 bright frosting 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.450
 and the color of the chocolate list a 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:41.370
 Once we have the glaze what we will do 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.370
 to avoid there being groups in it 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.949
 choked the final result here we have 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:48.910
 our braised chocolate super 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:52.690
 sparkly 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:54.090
 the frozen cake and the icing on its 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.460
 ideal temperature 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:07:00.120
 we will proceed to bathe 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.120
 with the glaze 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:08.319
 'espaÃ±a de la tarta' we will proceed to 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.139
 remove the edges so they can be 

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:12.860
 appreciate the interior and the 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:14.419
 layers that has 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.969
 and we have removed from the edges of the 

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:18.979
 cake we will proceed to write your name 

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:22.300
 above as decoration or

 emperor chocolate through 

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.940
 and well once the writing is done 

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:30.300
 through cornet this is our letter 

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.300
