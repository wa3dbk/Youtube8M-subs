00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
because that's what that dude does so

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.620 
because that's what that dude does so
now<00:01:38.549> technically<00:01:39.180> I'm<00:01:39.360> kind<00:01:39.600> of

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
now technically I'm kind of

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.300 
now technically I'm kind of
indestructible<00:01:40.020> unless<00:01:40.710> he<00:01:40.860> can<00:01:41.009> get<00:01:41.100> rid<00:01:41.280> of

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
indestructible unless he can get rid of

indestructible unless he can get rid of
an<00:01:41.490> enchantment<00:01:41.880> which<00:01:42.450> he<00:01:42.600> already<00:01:42.720> cast<00:01:43.079> his

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
an enchantment which he already cast his

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.490 
an enchantment which he already cast his
natural<00:01:44.549> eyes<00:01:44.700> which<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.180> what<00:01:45.509> does<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.720> so

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
natural eyes which is what does that so

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.910 
natural eyes which is what does that so
I<00:01:46.560> figured<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.490> was<00:01:47.610> in<00:01:47.700> pretty<00:01:47.850> good<00:01:47.970> shape

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
I figured I was in pretty good shape

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.060 
I figured I was in pretty good shape
but<00:01:49.960> the<00:01:50.960> long<00:01:51.140> and<00:01:51.320> short<00:01:51.350> of<00:01:51.590> it<00:01:51.650> is<00:01:51.799> he<00:01:51.920> got

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
but the long and short of it is he got

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.429 
but the long and short of it is he got
out<00:01:52.280> way<00:01:52.520> more<00:01:52.549> creatures<00:01:53.000> than<00:01:53.360> me<00:01:53.509> way<00:01:53.930> way

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
out way more creatures than me way way

out way more creatures than me way way
more<00:01:54.470> creatures<00:01:55.220> than<00:01:55.400> me<00:01:55.549> so<00:01:56.000> it<00:01:56.330> turns<00:01:56.600> out

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
more creatures than me so it turns out

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.240 
more creatures than me so it turns out
the<00:01:56.869> only<00:01:56.990> way<00:01:57.200> I<00:01:57.229> could<00:01:57.350> win<00:01:57.619> this<00:01:57.770> was<00:01:58.040> by

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
the only way I could win this was by

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.550 
the only way I could win this was by
drawing<00:01:58.610> him<00:01:59.030> like<00:01:59.479> milling<00:01:59.899> him<00:02:00.080> down<00:02:00.320> to

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
drawing him like milling him down to

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.070 
drawing him like milling him down to

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
zero cards in his deck since this is not

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.529 
zero cards in his deck since this is not
a<00:02:03.140> mill<00:02:03.470> deck<00:02:03.740> which<00:02:04.580> means<00:02:04.850> I<00:02:04.970> make<00:02:05.149> him<00:02:05.330> draw

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
a mill deck which means I make him draw

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:06.130 
a mill deck which means I make him draw

the artifact at this point there's so

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.420 
the artifact at this point there's so
much<00:02:44.410> on<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.650> table<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.070> game<00:02:45.280> is

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
much on the table the game is

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.080 
much on the table the game is
starting<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.910> glitch<00:02:46.620> graphically<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:48.190> I

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
starting to glitch graphically and I

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.420 
starting to glitch graphically and I
nearly<00:02:49.840> my<00:02:50.020> pants<00:02:50.440> because<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:51.250> means

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
nearly my pants because that means

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.340 
nearly my pants because that means
that<00:02:51.610> I've<00:02:51.790> wasted<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.270> last<00:02:52.540> two<00:02:52.780> hours<00:02:52.840> all

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
that I've wasted the last two hours all

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.040 
that I've wasted the last two hours all
he<00:02:53.500> has<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:53.770> do<00:02:53.860> is<00:02:54.010> attack<00:02:54.340> me<00:02:54.640> and<00:02:54.840> he<00:02:55.840> doesn't

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
he has to do is attack me and he doesn't

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.170 
he has to do is attack me and he doesn't
for<00:02:56.710> some<00:02:56.860> reason<00:02:57.160> I<00:02:57.310> think<00:02:57.370> I<00:02:57.610> broke<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:58.000> game

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
for some reason I think I broke the game

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.530 
for some reason I think I broke the game
so<00:02:58.510> he<00:02:58.810> skips<00:02:59.140> his<00:02:59.320> attack<00:02:59.940> next<00:03:00.940> turn<00:03:01.090> since<00:03:01.420> I

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
so he skips his attack next turn since I

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.510 
so he skips his attack next turn since I
have<00:03:01.660> nothing<00:03:01.990> to<00:03:02.020> lose<00:03:02.290> he<00:03:02.620> next<00:03:03.040> turn<00:03:03.250> he's

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
have nothing to lose he next turn he's

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.210 
have nothing to lose he next turn he's
going<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:03.730> draw<00:03:04.000> or<00:03:04.390> try<00:03:05.320> and<00:03:05.380> draw<00:03:05.620> card<00:03:05.920> not

be able to and that causes you to lose

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.260 
be able to and that causes you to lose
the<00:03:08.080> game<00:03:08.260> in<00:03:08.410> magic<00:03:08.800> there's<00:03:09.280> a<00:03:09.670> few<00:03:10.120> ways<00:03:10.240> you
