00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:07.230
 hi friends how are you today I want to talk 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:10.050
 of the importance of capillary massage not 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.300
 only for relaxation but for 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.960
 hair growth and also 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:19.079
 to avoid falling is very good both 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.570
 as for men as for women and I 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:24.269
 I 'm going to tell you a technique that to me in 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.289
 the personal has worked for me 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.359
 benefits nourishes hair follicles 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:33.420
 promotes the birth of new hair 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.239
 it's thinner, it's really shinier 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.789
 I have noticed a big difference in the 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.780
 quality of my hair since I'm 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:45.870
 doing hair massage almost daily 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.670
 in the evening if they go to Sinai if nobody 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.010
 he sees them as they begin to become 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.440
 piojito and it's like if we 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.140
 we were injecting vitality into the 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.469
 hair movement I do not know what happens but 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.050
 that hair noticeably improves what 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.450
 can do without anything or can do it 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.540
 with a milestone oil that would be 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.150
 and if what they are looking for is that the hair 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.350
 grow faster I recommend you the 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.350
 Castor oil 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.090
 let's open our hands and throw us 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:22.719
 the hair back like that what 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.689
 we were combing in total try 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:28.479
 do it 10 minutes this massage like that 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:31.090
 we 're combing it back and this 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.600
 you do not have to be aggressive you do not have to 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:38.049
 to hurt us is simply to take our 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.439
 hair back caressing with the 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:44.319
 fingertip our leather hair 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:47.920
 Now with the tips of our fingers 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:51.009
 let's start to massage 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:55.000
 just like I 'm doing right now and 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:57.229
 let's go looking back towards the 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.450
 nape 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:06.380
 soft but if pressing with the 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.380
 yolk of our fingers and down 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:14.110
 and on the sides that you feel that 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:17.380
 they are with small circles encompassing 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.410
 all your hair from birth 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.959
 remember do not have to hurt 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.209
 let's open our hand let's go how 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.739
 bury the hair and press 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:33.010
 let's press a few seconds 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:35.410
 after pressing down not so much 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.459
 going through it but moving a hand and 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:42.730
 putting it in another place until you get 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.640
 down we buried our fingers in the 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.030
 hair 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.990
 we buried the hand and with the thumbs 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:56.060
 we press like that on the sides and we're going 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.060
 traveling in the same way 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.560
 Now let's make some small 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:09.780
 pinches like our hands are 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.780
 tweezers and let's do this 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.670
 activating everything that has been the 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.670
 scalp 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:28.870
 it is a blood activation throughout the 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.870
 hair covering the whole head 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:38.200
 at the birth of hair too and 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:40.870
 it feels so good that they're going to 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.840
 turn into a vice and finally with 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.079
 oil and toxins the tito let's do 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.909
 this strong around the scalp 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:54.720
 without hurting us like we're 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:54.720
 committing down we're going down 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.870
 and something that has changed a lot what 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.580
 it's been the texture of my hair 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.210
 because the truth is that he was too 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.220
 dry too much like scourer is the 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:11.050
 collagen no matter which brand you take 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.650
 It may be in a pill but I have felt 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.239
 an awesome change in my hair the 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.790
 truth has been one of the supplements 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.190
 that I like very much prevents the 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.980
 premature aging helps the 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.320
 joints has helped me a lot 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.760
 to the nails to the hair to the skin of 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.130
 true truth but they have to be 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.110
 constant to start feeling 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.270
 changes like 6-8 weeks each 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.280
 person is different with massage 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.770

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.170
 women and men who have 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.820
 thinning hair but remember 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.620
 that all vitamins work from 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.770
 inside out then it takes a while 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.780
 that we begin to take advantage of these 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:05.480
 benefits make these more taquitos 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.480
