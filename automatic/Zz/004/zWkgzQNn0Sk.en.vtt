00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.359 
me that i'm ordering in order to get rid
of<00:02:01.060> some<00:02:01.359> of<00:02:01.389> them<00:02:01.679> deeper<00:02:02.679> marks<00:02:03.039> that<00:02:03.189> i<00:02:03.249> do

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
of some of them deeper marks that i do

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.370 
of some of them deeper marks that i do
have<00:02:03.520> and<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.509> serums<00:02:04.929> will<00:02:05.079> penetrate

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
have and the serums will penetrate

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.160 
have and the serums will penetrate
deeper<00:02:06.069> than<00:02:06.280> any<00:02:06.759> creams<00:02:07.179> or<00:02:07.450> moisturizers

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
deeper than any creams or moisturizers

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.960 
deeper than any creams or moisturizers
any<00:02:08.440> of<00:02:08.590> that<00:02:08.709> they'll<00:02:09.160> penetrate<00:02:09.399> deeper

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
any of that they'll penetrate deeper

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.610 
any of that they'll penetrate deeper
because<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.390> molecules<00:02:10.569> and<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.170> serums<00:02:11.500> are

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
because the molecules and the serums are

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.370 
because the molecules and the serums are
a<00:02:11.680> lot<00:02:11.890> smaller<00:02:12.220> and<00:02:12.750> they<00:02:13.750> will<00:02:13.870> help<00:02:14.050> lift

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
a lot smaller and they will help lift

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.580 
a lot smaller and they will help lift
that<00:02:14.650> melanin

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
that melanin

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.560 
that melanin
in<00:02:16.590> those<00:02:16.920> dark<00:02:17.160> marks<00:02:17.550> though<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.120> do<00:02:18.180> like

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
in those dark marks though and I do like

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.020 
in those dark marks though and I do like
the<00:02:18.600> final<00:02:19.080> shoot<00:02:19.500> once<00:02:19.770> this<00:02:19.980> little<00:02:20.370> bit<00:02:20.880> is

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
the final shoot once this little bit is

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.670 
the final shoot once this little bit is
gone<00:02:21.210> so<00:02:21.390> hopefully<00:02:21.690> about<00:02:21.870> tomorrow<00:02:22.260> morning

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
gone so hopefully about tomorrow morning

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.730 
gone so hopefully about tomorrow morning
it'll<00:02:23.520> be<00:02:23.640> gone<00:02:23.850> a<00:02:24.180> hundred<00:02:24.450> percent<00:02:24.690> if<00:02:25.470> not

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
it'll be gone a hundred percent if not

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.570 
it'll be gone a hundred percent if not
close<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:26.850> talk<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.240> you<00:02:27.420> later<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.890> stay
