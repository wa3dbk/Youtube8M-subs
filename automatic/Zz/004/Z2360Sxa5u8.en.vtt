00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.370
 how the one-sided pastl bag is sewn 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.849
 will we show you in this movie to 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:13.080
 you need some scissors on the basis of mars 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:16.289
 can needle a sewing needle pin 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.510
 A trick mark an insert strip 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.420
 a matching strip and a 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.490
 Matching insert strips a bag 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.859
 podlas upper and a lining 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.930
 bags pouches photo bag is 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.019
 a little smaller than the one from the upper part 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.480
 and an upper we start with it 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.239
 to reinforce our pockets 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.950
 For this we take the insert strip and 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.260
 bÃ¼dingen where then the bag 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.270
 is provided and suited ours 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.410
 We also reinforce this with stripes 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.410
 the insert strip 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.340
 Now we'll record our bag 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.640
 We have to fit the first one 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.430
 strip off that with us now 15 cm 3 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.830
 cm of it are intended as additional 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.830
 that means our finished bag will be 12 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:10.840
 cm we are to lay down the pass 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:12.700
 once in the break that is 25 cm allowed 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.580
 a centimeter after adding that 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.990
 means our firm pastl is 1.5 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.300
 cm wide 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.270
 that means for us now we have to 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:26.430
 here a bag width of 12 cm 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.450
 draw in and a width of 15 cm 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.600
 I have ours first 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.660
 incision line drawn by the 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.070
 outgoing we have now just 0 75 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:42.850
 centimeter draw 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:44.320
 that then returns together 15 and 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.780
 if now our bags a drawing 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.490
 also on the right side of the fabric 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.250
 we see a thread thread 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.250
 a simple research with a simple 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:59.649
 I sew nothing so you see it then 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:02.560
 also on the front we have ourselves 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.950
 Everything stapled we pull our bag 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.039
 on the right side we need too 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.580
 the upper fabric bag bag arrives 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.500
 the upper side of the bag and the 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.450
 tastel bag that comes down 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.120
 We are now centering this here 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.770
 in that there is still the same but 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:27.010
 like here you can have one again 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.950
 hand market check so here we have 15 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.020
 the jammer 15 that is very important now 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.060
 that you work exactly because otherwise you will 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.450
 the bag then went wrong or not 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.150
 clean which is a relief 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.860
 if we still bag here in bags 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.910
 and in the tinker the centimeter 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.910
 draw after addition 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:55.690
 then stuck essence and must 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.400
 is at the bottom of the come so the 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.470
 middle thread thread is ours on 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.220
 pests and the two are ours 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.220
 seam lines 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.060
 if then always where I have to stop 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.819
 or to start growing one 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.420
 marking nose 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.829
 Here we put the top part 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.930
 so now I check all this 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.970
 on the back of my veins 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.799
 are exactly on my lines 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:28.450
 that means we can now both 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:35.950
 I sewed I was starting now I take 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:39.129
 want to get out my marker, needle 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.359
 I did the first act when we got the 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.790
 make second load that we only 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:45.430
 take care that we do not miss the seam 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.540
 take away from paste strips therefore 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:52.720
 I work for now times as a 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:55.060
 Now we have ours 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.250
 tinkering of bags bocce pinned 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.790
 then we check again on the 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.239
 back 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.579
 Here you can see the pink to exactly 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.769
 at the same height 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:07.769
 now we can only thread in heft at 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.720
 make the cut blade 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.940
 I would strengthen those two now 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.560
 still inside and cut now 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.430
 we are in the incision line 1 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.870
 It is important to note that we are in the end 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.090
 about a centimeter before stop because 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.830
 we cut here to a pointy 1 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.860
 and also be careful that you are here 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.849
 I do not cut with the additions 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.220
 keep me with them a bit 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:32.770
 Just fingered the almost gave away that 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:36.240
 I do not cut it with fast here 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.240
 I now just at the beginning a 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.760
 then we take them out of our bags 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.760
 bag inside 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.850
 and we do that with the 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:57.160
 pass now we have to iron 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.330
 We iron the seam of the bags 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.210
 bag upwards 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:04.230
 and the almost gift of the pass strip 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.230
 stage like apart 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.430
 we have to be our pastor now 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.890
 move up or down again 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:21.550
 pull outside because it has to yes to the 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:25.960
 edge of the paperback poke 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:28.170
 that's just right here fit there 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.960
 I first stuck with a needle 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:35.080
 but only deny the pass so 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.700
 not on the fabric that stuck 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:44.920
 Pastel is violently close sometimes 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:48.280
 Fast next we have to 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:50.950
 here still these holes the 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.940
 sew together now so we'll put it 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.590
 we are so 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.690
 Then we had to go to the bags 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:59.610
 fold above what I would not 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:02.950
 take it with you and then we're stuck here 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.480
 this lace off I make myself a needle 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.890
 purely 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.670
 this will be the hole here 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.650
 closed 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.840
 It is now only on the 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.810
 park stripes not sewn on the 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.040
 bags pouch 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.110
 now we can sew here and that only 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.550
 a short stretch is only possible 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.950
 on TV so I just once 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.030
 forward and then back again and 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.410
 then again forward 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.410
 then it is also well linked 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.610
 the bag looks from the outside is already 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.110
 we almost finished that we have to back 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.539
 still the second bag bag 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.699
 attach the we fold the upper 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:41.229
 cloth bags bag back up 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:43.569
 then we have our pastor here 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:47.139
 and we take care of that now 

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:49.569
 we saddle up our lining bag 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:53.400
 put it on we stuck it so tight 

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:53.400
 will be very close to this approach 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.409
 we have our bags here 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.659
 sewn on bag that then looks from them 

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:08.970
 so we can all go 

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:11.289
 Remove remaining folder 

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:14.169
 Thanks, we had our or 

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:16.360
 bags down because of the bag 

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:17.919
 We now pinned here then take 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:23.020
 we're around here so much 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:24.490
 The bag is closed when sewing 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.949
 be careful that we do not have the 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:29.460
 So outer fabric to take the work on 

00:07:26.949 --> 00:07:29.460
 the side 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:37.980
 and now our one-sided fit 

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.980
 bag finished
