migrated all of the data on this laptop
into<00:00:22.480> this<00:00:22.720> using<00:00:23.170> a<00:00:23.260> very<00:00:23.440> simple<00:00:23.830> program

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.100

and now I'm going to open up the back of
the<00:00:27.010> left<00:00:27.160> ok<00:00:27.730> so<00:00:28.330> you<00:00:28.390> just<00:00:28.960> want<00:00:29.170> to<00:00:29.199> use<00:00:29.380> your

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
the left ok so you just want to use your

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.150 
the left ok so you just want to use your
fingernail<00:00:30.039> and<00:00:30.340> get<00:00:31.150> as<00:00:31.420> close<00:00:32.199> in<00:00:32.439> as<00:00:32.529> you

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:36.729 
can into the crack and then I'm going to

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:46.110 
can into the crack and then I'm going to
jam<00:00:37.210> this<00:00:38.519> card<00:00:39.519> and<00:00:39.909> then<00:00:40.659> um<00:00:41.850> gently<00:00:44.819> push<00:00:45.819> up

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.759 
jam this card and then um gently push up
and<00:00:46.420> you'll<00:00:46.690> hear<00:00:46.989> a<00:00:47.019> click<00:00:47.589> of<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:49.769> plastic

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:52.680 
and you'll hear a click of the plastic
tabs<00:00:51.039> opening<00:00:51.850> up<00:00:51.999> and<00:00:52.210> I'm<00:00:52.269> going<00:00:52.389> to<00:00:52.449> do<00:00:52.569> that

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
tabs opening up and I'm going to do that

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.160 
tabs opening up and I'm going to do that
all<00:00:52.989> the<00:00:53.019> way<00:00:53.170> around<00:00:55.379> ok<00:00:56.409> so<00:00:56.620> I've<00:00:57.149> gotten

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
all the way around ok so I've gotten

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.239 
all the way around ok so I've gotten
almost<00:00:59.170> all<00:01:00.100> of<00:01:00.159> it<00:01:00.639> open<00:01:01.299> just<00:01:02.019> by<00:01:02.229> using<00:01:02.949> the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:03.249 
almost all of it open just by using the

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:05.250 
almost all of it open just by using the
fingernail<00:01:03.609> and<00:01:03.819> one<00:01:04.030> thing<00:01:04.239> I<00:01:04.479> recommend<00:01:04.750> is

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
fingernail and one thing I recommend is

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.920 
fingernail and one thing I recommend is
if<00:01:05.560> you're<00:01:06.190> opening<00:01:06.760> this<00:01:07.030> that<00:01:07.330> you<00:01:07.420> go<00:01:07.600> back

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
if you're opening this that you go back

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.800 
if you're opening this that you go back
and<00:01:08.170> forth<00:01:08.500> on<00:01:08.740> the<00:01:09.100> sides<00:01:10.920> because<00:01:11.920> as<00:01:12.810> you

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
and forth on the sides because as you

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.000 
and forth on the sides because as you
open<00:01:14.200> this<00:01:14.380> side<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:16.330> side<00:01:16.570> will<00:01:16.840> also<00:01:17.290> open

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
open this side this side will also open

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.670 
open this side this side will also open
up<00:01:18.460> a<00:01:18.610> little<00:01:18.790> bit<00:01:18.910> more<00:01:19.300> so<00:01:19.720> it<00:01:20.050> makes<00:01:20.350> your

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
up a little bit more so it makes your

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.940 
up a little bit more so it makes your
job<00:01:20.740> a<00:01:21.220> lot<00:01:21.430> easier<00:01:21.700> to<00:01:22.600> go<00:01:22.780> back<00:01:23.110> and<00:01:23.290> forth<00:01:23.620> on

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
job a lot easier to go back and forth on

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.610 
job a lot easier to go back and forth on
either<00:01:24.280> side<00:01:24.700> I<00:01:24.910> was<00:01:25.030> just<00:01:25.240> able<00:01:25.420> to<00:01:25.690> go

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.070 
either side I was just able to go
underneath<00:01:27.040> the<00:01:27.310> hinge<00:01:27.550> and<00:01:27.730> easily<00:01:28.480> take<00:01:28.810> it

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
underneath the hinge and easily take it

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.740 
underneath the hinge and easily take it
off<00:01:29.290> takes<00:01:29.920> about<00:01:30.070> 15<00:01:30.550> minutes<00:01:30.580> to<00:01:31.270> remove<00:01:31.570> the

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
and just as a comparison I when I have

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:26.050 
and just as a comparison I when I have
the<00:03:24.200> one<00:03:24.379> terabyte<00:03:24.799> hard<00:03:25.010> drive<00:03:25.340> it<00:03:25.579> took<00:03:25.760> one

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
the one terabyte hard drive it took one

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.929 
the one terabyte hard drive it took one
minute<00:03:26.239> and<00:03:26.540> three<00:03:26.810> seconds<00:03:27.379> to<00:03:27.769> boot<00:03:28.010> up<00:03:28.219> so

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:28.939 
minute and three seconds to boot up so

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:31.629 
minute and three seconds to boot up so
let's<00:03:29.239> see<00:03:29.419> if<00:03:29.719> it<00:03:29.989> goes<00:03:30.379> faster<00:03:31.069> using<00:03:31.340> this

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
let's see if it goes faster using this

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.599 
let's see if it goes faster using this
and<00:03:31.879> yes<00:03:32.209> it<00:03:32.480> definitely<00:03:33.019> does<00:03:33.310> so<00:03:34.310> it<00:03:34.430> looks

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
and yes it definitely does so it looks

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.229 
and yes it definitely does so it looks
like<00:03:34.780> it's<00:03:35.780> fast<00:03:36.109> really<00:03:36.650> fast<00:03:36.829> a<00:03:37.340> much<00:03:37.969> faster

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
like it's fast really fast a much faster

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.170 
like it's fast really fast a much faster
than<00:03:38.569> I<00:03:38.689> even<00:03:38.840> thought<00:03:38.959> it<00:03:39.290> would<00:03:39.500> be<00:03:39.680> and

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
than I even thought it would be and

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.240 
than I even thought it would be and
installing<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.510> SSD<00:03:42.019> was<00:03:42.349> pretty<00:03:42.980> painless

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
and most difficult part was taking the

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.990 
and most difficult part was taking the
cover<00:03:45.169> off<00:03:45.290> uh<00:03:46.479> so<00:03:47.620> my<00:03:48.620> review<00:03:48.859> of<00:03:49.069> this<00:03:49.790> in

if it is then you shouldn't have any

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.529 
if it is then you shouldn't have any
problem<00:04:14.599> installing<00:04:15.139> it<00:04:15.319> and<00:04:15.739> it<00:04:16.400> will<00:04:16.639> make<00:04:17.329> a

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
problem installing it and it will make a

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.050 
problem installing it and it will make a
brand<00:04:17.840> new<00:04:17.989> computer<00:04:18.320> because<00:04:19.190> if<00:04:19.609> I<00:04:19.759> can<00:04:19.909> do
