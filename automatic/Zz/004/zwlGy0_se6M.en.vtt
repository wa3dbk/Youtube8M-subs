Bethesda<00:01:56.070> created<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.460> game<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.969> they

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
Bethesda created the game and they

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.420 
Bethesda created the game and they
released<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.570> mod<00:01:57.750> tools<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.380> all<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:59.280> would

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
released the mod tools so all that would

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.800 
released the mod tools so all that would
not<00:01:59.579> be<00:01:59.610> possible<00:01:59.850> if<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.420> wasn't<00:02:00.689> for

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
not be possible if it wasn't for

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.170 
not be possible if it wasn't for
bethesda<00:02:01.070> but<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.250> wasn't<00:02:02.520> just<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.700> thursday

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
bethesda but it wasn't just the thursday

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.969 
bethesda but it wasn't just the thursday
sharing<00:02:03.540> in<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.689> profits<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:04.290> was<00:02:04.409> also<00:02:04.590> valve

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
sharing in the profits it was also valve

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.249 
sharing in the profits it was also valve
and<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:05.939> makes<00:02:06.149> sense<00:02:06.450> because<00:02:06.659> valve<00:02:07.110> is

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
and that makes sense because valve is

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.889 
and that makes sense because valve is
the<00:02:07.500> distributor<00:02:08.399> but<00:02:08.759> nevertheless<00:02:09.060> it's

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
the distributor but nevertheless it's

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.509 
the distributor but nevertheless it's
seemed<00:02:10.049> like<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.379> mod<00:02:10.560> creator<00:02:10.950> wasn't

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
seemed like the mod creator wasn't

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.670 
seemed like the mod creator wasn't
getting<00:02:11.790> enough<00:02:11.909> i<00:02:12.540> think<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.470> the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
getting enough i think that the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.800 
getting enough i think that the
percentage<00:02:14.040> split<00:02:14.400> should<00:02:15.209> have<00:02:15.299> been<00:02:15.480> more

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
percentage split should have been more

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.860 
percentage split should have been more
equal<00:02:16.349> because<00:02:17.220> at<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.730> stage<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.390> was<00:02:18.569> not

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
equal because at that stage it was not

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.319 
equal because at that stage it was not
equal<00:02:19.319> in<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.709> slightest<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.519> also<00:02:20.939> as<00:02:21.090> well

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
equal in the slightest and also as well

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.179 
equal in the slightest and also as well
there<00:02:21.510> are<00:02:21.629> some<00:02:21.810> people<00:02:22.230> not<00:02:22.470> myself<00:02:22.769> but

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
there are some people not myself but

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
income and they just would not see that

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.069 
income and they just would not see that
financial<00:03:34.560> reward<00:03:34.980> with<00:03:35.760> creating<00:03:36.299> mods<00:03:36.569> even

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
financial reward with creating mods even

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.140 
financial reward with creating mods even
if<00:03:37.260> they<00:03:37.409> implemented<00:03:37.829> a<00:03:38.099> donate<00:03:38.549> button<00:03:38.579> on

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
if they implemented a donate button on

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.110 
if they implemented a donate button on
their<00:03:39.659> Nexus<00:03:40.049> mod<00:03:40.229> page<00:03:40.590> so<00:03:41.220> in<00:03:41.370> that<00:03:41.519> sense<00:03:41.879> I

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
their Nexus mod page so in that sense I

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.270 
their Nexus mod page so in that sense I
would<00:03:42.540> like<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.810> see<00:03:43.079> a<00:03:43.109> system<00:03:43.739> where<00:03:43.979> mod

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
would like to see a system where mod

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.909 
would like to see a system where mod
creators<00:03:44.579> can<00:03:45.090> be<00:03:45.329> financially<00:03:46.049> benefited<00:03:46.620> do

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
creators can be financially benefited do

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:48.740 
creators can be financially benefited do
I<00:03:46.949> think<00:03:47.310> it<00:03:47.430> should<00:03:47.609> look<00:03:47.819> like<00:03:47.879> the<00:03:48.299> system

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
I think it should look like the system

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.330 
I think it should look like the system
that<00:03:48.959> Bethesda<00:03:49.169> rolled<00:03:49.739> out<00:03:49.889> before

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
that Bethesda rolled out before

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.909 
that Bethesda rolled out before
absolutely<00:03:51.299> not<00:03:51.569> that<00:03:51.599> paid<00:03:52.109> mod<00:03:52.319> system<00:03:52.739> was

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
absolutely not that paid mod system was

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.280 
absolutely not that paid mod system was
abysmal<00:03:53.370> in<00:03:53.849> my<00:03:53.970> personal<00:03:54.239> opinion<00:03:54.540> but<00:03:55.229> I

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
abysmal in my personal opinion but I

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.659 
abysmal in my personal opinion but I
would<00:03:55.590> like<00:03:55.799> to<00:03:55.829> see<00:03:56.099> something<00:03:56.340> different

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
would like to see something different

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.879 
would like to see something different
perhaps<00:03:57.599> along<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.079> lines<00:03:58.319> of<00:03:58.650> a

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
perhaps along the lines of a

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.099 
perhaps along the lines of a
pay-what-you-want<00:03:59.699> system<00:04:00.449> so<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:00.810> could

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
pay-what-you-want system so you could

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.830 
pay-what-you-want system so you could
pay<00:04:01.290> anywhere<00:04:01.680> between<00:04:01.859> thirty<00:04:02.790> cents<00:04:03.299> up<00:04:03.419> to

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
pay anywhere between thirty cents up to

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.199 
pay anywhere between thirty cents up to
twenty<00:04:04.680> dollars<00:04:05.010> for<00:04:05.190> example<00:04:05.669> for<00:04:06.180> a

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
twenty dollars for example for a

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.210 
twenty dollars for example for a
particular<00:04:06.479> mod<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.199> that<00:04:07.560> way<00:04:07.709> people<00:04:07.979> that

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
particular mod and that way people that

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.710 
particular mod and that way people that
don't<00:04:08.370> really<00:04:08.579> like<00:04:08.729> paying<00:04:09.060> for<00:04:09.150> mods<00:04:09.449> can

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
don't really like paying for mods can

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.449 
don't really like paying for mods can
pay<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:10.019> cheaper<00:04:10.349> amount<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:10.799> people<00:04:11.340> that

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
pay the cheaper amount and people that

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.129 
pay the cheaper amount and people that
would<00:04:11.639> not<00:04:11.819> mind<00:04:12.090> paying<00:04:12.299> for<00:04:12.720> mods<00:04:12.930> and

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
would not mind paying for mods and

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.930 
would not mind paying for mods and
supporting<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:13.799> mod<00:04:13.949> maker<00:04:14.190> could<00:04:14.519> pay<00:04:14.760> a

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
supporting the mod maker could pay a

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.069 
supporting the mod maker could pay a
higher<00:04:15.239> amount

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
higher amount

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.659 
higher amount
that's<00:04:16.289> just<00:04:16.379> one<00:04:16.680> idea<00:04:16.859> to<00:04:17.039> put<00:04:17.220> out<00:04:17.400> there

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
that's just one idea to put out there

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.640 
that's just one idea to put out there
and<00:04:17.909> I<00:04:18.060> think<00:04:18.419> Bethesda<00:04:18.959> is<00:04:19.079> going<00:04:19.470> to<00:04:19.560> be

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
and I think Bethesda is going to be

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.039 
and I think Bethesda is going to be
tinkering<00:04:20.189> with<00:04:20.250> that<00:04:20.659> eventually<00:04:21.659> because

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
tinkering with that eventually because

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.439 
tinkering with that eventually because
what<00:04:22.259> Todd<00:04:22.470> Howard<00:04:22.680> says<00:04:23.099> is<00:04:23.370> not<00:04:24.060> that<00:04:24.270> there

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
what Todd Howard says is not that there

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:26.420 
what Todd Howard says is not that there
will<00:04:24.569> never<00:04:24.780> be<00:04:24.960> plans<00:04:25.409> for<00:04:25.650> a<00:04:25.710> payment<00:04:26.069> system

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
will never be plans for a payment system

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.640 
will never be plans for a payment system
what<00:04:26.639> he<00:04:26.729> says<00:04:27.000> is<00:04:27.180> that<00:04:27.210> there<00:04:27.900> are<00:04:27.930> currently

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
what he says is that there are currently

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.189 
what he says is that there are currently
no<00:04:28.770> plans<00:04:29.219> for<00:04:29.550> a<00:04:29.669> payment<00:04:30.090> system<00:04:30.479> so<00:04:31.050> is

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
no plans for a payment system so is

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.839 
no plans for a payment system so is
leaving<00:04:31.590> that<00:04:31.620> door<00:04:31.770> open<00:04:31.979> and<00:04:32.490> I<00:04:32.580> want<00:04:32.759> to

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849 
leaving that door open and I want to

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:35.420 
leaving that door open and I want to
stress<00:04:33.120> that<00:04:33.560> eventually<00:04:34.560> I'm<00:04:34.770> thinking<00:04:35.189> we

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
stress that eventually I'm thinking we

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.820 
stress that eventually I'm thinking we
are<00:04:35.669> going<00:04:35.879> to<00:04:36.060> see<00:04:36.240> a<00:04:36.270> paid<00:04:36.659> mod<00:04:36.870> system<00:04:37.349> but

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
are going to see a paid mod system but

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.379 
are going to see a paid mod system but
something<00:04:38.189> that's<00:04:38.370> completely<00:04:38.490> different<00:04:38.939> to

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
something that's completely different to

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:40.969 
something that's completely different to
what<00:04:39.509> we<00:04:39.569> saw<00:04:39.900> with<00:04:40.319> the<00:04:40.500> elder<00:04:40.710> scrolls

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
what we saw with the elder scrolls

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:42.379 
what we saw with the elder scrolls
skyrim<00:04:41.099> i<00:04:41.580> think<00:04:41.819> is<00:04:41.909> going<00:04:42.090> to<00:04:42.150> be<00:04:42.180> more

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
skyrim i think is going to be more

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.179 
skyrim i think is going to be more
refined<00:04:42.870> i<00:04:43.080> think<00:04:43.560> it's<00:04:43.680> going<00:04:43.830> to<00:04:43.919> be<00:04:44.009> more

00:04:44.179 --> 00:04:44.189 
refined i think it's going to be more

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:46.249 
refined i think it's going to be more
fair<00:04:44.550> to<00:04:44.729> the<00:04:44.819> mod<00:04:45.030> maker<00:04:45.270> i<00:04:45.599> think<00:04:46.050> there<00:04:46.169> are

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 
fair to the mod maker i think there are

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.080 
fair to the mod maker i think there are
going<00:04:46.289> to<00:04:46.409> be<00:04:46.469> more<00:04:46.740> options<00:04:47.370> in<00:04:47.490> terms<00:04:47.520> of<00:04:47.879> how

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
going to be more options in terms of how

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.969 
going to be more options in terms of how
you<00:04:48.150> actually<00:04:48.509> pay<00:04:49.050> for<00:04:49.319> the<00:04:49.409> mods<00:04:49.620> but

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
you actually pay for the mods but

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:51.230 
you actually pay for the mods but
definitely<00:04:50.460> it's<00:04:50.550> going<00:04:50.669> to<00:04:50.759> be<00:04:50.819> vastly

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
definitely it's going to be vastly

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.149 
definitely it's going to be vastly
different<00:04:51.629> to<00:04:51.719> what<00:04:51.810> we<00:04:51.960> saw<00:04:52.110> before<00:04:52.139> and<00:04:52.800> so

00:04:53.149 --> 00:04:53.159 
different to what we saw before and so

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:54.619 
different to what we saw before and so
long<00:04:53.310> as<00:04:53.430> they<00:04:53.520> implement<00:04:53.699> a<00:04:54.090> system<00:04:54.479> that

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:54.629 
long as they implement a system that

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:57.020 
long as they implement a system that
works<00:04:54.690> that's<00:04:55.590> fair<00:04:56.039> and<00:04:56.340> that's<00:04:56.879> actually

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
works that's fair and that's actually

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.779 
works that's fair and that's actually
beneficial<00:04:57.750> not<00:04:58.169> only<00:04:58.229> to<00:04:58.590> the<00:04:58.710> consumer<00:04:59.340> but

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
beneficial not only to the consumer but

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:01.520 
beneficial not only to the consumer but
also<00:05:00.000> to<00:05:00.240> mod<00:05:00.419> makers<00:05:00.780> and<00:05:00.960> i'd<00:05:01.020> be<00:05:01.050> happy<00:05:01.500> with

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
also to mod makers and i'd be happy with

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.469 
also to mod makers and i'd be happy with
that<00:05:01.710> now<00:05:02.129> how<00:05:02.370> would<00:05:02.430> it<00:05:02.729> be<00:05:02.849> beneficial<00:05:03.449> to

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
that now how would it be beneficial to

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.110 
that now how would it be beneficial to
the<00:05:03.659> consumer<00:05:04.199> well<00:05:04.830> if<00:05:05.129> mod<00:05:05.490> makers<00:05:05.879> are

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
the consumer well if mod makers are

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.600 
the consumer well if mod makers are
incentivized<00:05:07.110> to<00:05:07.289> create<00:05:07.710> bigger<00:05:08.069> and<00:05:08.430> better

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
incentivized to create bigger and better
