00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.430
 I ask you a question, which is the 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.340
 meaning of money to you 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.350
 money is a matter of time to 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.350
 poor people is a matter of time for 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.240
 losing clearly prosperous is an issue 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.910
 of time to win if your thinking 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.630
 about money is that it is difficult to 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:32.110
 to gain from what is scarce to win if 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.219
 Your thinking is that your work is 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.129
 always a fight 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:40.060
 Sorry to talk but you're 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:42.370
 really poor just like things 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.530
 good happens to you when you are 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.649
 good mood make money and get 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.260
 prosperity also depends on your 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.420
 positive attitude toward relationships with 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.510
 emotional disposition you have with the 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.610
 money is directly proportional to the 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.579
 amount of money you want 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.620
 win our friend then 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.640
 to face money a relationship 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.320
 healthy 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.600
 instead of hating the money you 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.899
 need to love money the more you 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.469
 hate people but they move away from 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:14.889
 you 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:17.310
 The more you call the people 

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:19.869
 But they do not even have it for you. 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.189
 The more you use people 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.189
 for your trampoline 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:26.499
 but she took revenge on you then the same 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.630
 so we have a bad relationship with 

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:30.909
 people a bad relationship with money 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.459
 it also keeps him away from you 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.179

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:37.209
 money 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:39.549
 so the poor mind really is 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:43.869
 acting on your prosperity on 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:45.639
 your wealth prosperous mind operates in the 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.579
