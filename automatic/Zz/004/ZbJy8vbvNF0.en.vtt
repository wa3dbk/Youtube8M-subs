00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.849
 well found boys in the house of 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.130
 food here and mick this new episode 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.890
 of the play for facebook as you see I do not 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.930
 I'm in live but if you liked the episode 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.640
 of andrÃ© I will soon see that 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.060
 however if you liked it I will be 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.590
 quiet 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.289
 I will quietly be willing to do a 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.539
 episode in live not only the live then 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.090
 let's say right away what the episode will look like 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.920
 see I'm shopping because 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.719
 as from a couple of episodes to this 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.100
 part I always find many credits 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.170
 at the beginning therefore decided to do them 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.149
 at the beginning, however, have for all 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.219
 and three matches a good team and I have 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.950
 bought diamonds walls with co2 that 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.960
 I think they will be diamond holders and muriel 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.420
 and with coca it is an excellent reserve on hold 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.620
 obviously of abbot we have suffered the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.140
 first game as you see part 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.350
 pretty good when this good bon 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.989
 klose bon bon goal in front of the door 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.539
 a German rarely misses the game 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.670
 but then, as you can see, it will go immediately 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.320
 for the draw as he makes a 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.299
 great exchange between iversen osvaldo la 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.640
 ball returns to emerson a lot of shooting 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.869
 very good as action the shot is not 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.939
 angolatissimo in the advice goes down it seems 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.140
 the intent is very slow but oh well 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.659
 give the rewarded action 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.100
 fortunately after turn disk 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.350
 as said it is a defensive nation in 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.490
 offensive diamond ball that is wrong 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.960
 then he puts on his own borja valero 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.810
 that klose passes it the ball returns 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.340
 beautiful diamonds throw for walls and then 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.900
 very nice action also my wall yes 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.710
 move just enough to see 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.990
 the door 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.390
 let's say free and then kick in the goal 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.770
 for the goal of 2 1 beautiful very beautiful 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.200
 beautiful as a beautiful goal the action is me 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.509
 much liked and later as you see these 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.790
 here the twenty-fifth a few minutes later 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.350
 now I remember when it starts flooding 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.110
 very much my opponent withdraws 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.850
 so the game ends here is 39th 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.530
 ends 2 1 for I watch the shots o 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.299
 seven he 1 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.829
 so let's say that was was enough in 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.250
 control 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.979
 fortunately, the game is fortunate 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.630
 so he disconnects I think 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.369
 why started the races 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.930
 so the connection will have fallen 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.369
 I win 21 so let's go straight to the 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.370
 second match match 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.530
 a good training look at sergio 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.690
 in short, ramos injures all those 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.700
 phenomena but fortunately the phenomena 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.680
 I also call myself riccardo 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.900
 montolivo look at what it is here 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.599
 invents montolivo really one of the goals 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.180
 perhaps the most beautiful in the history of play 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.069
 for fun from episode 1 to here 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.630
 because really really beautiful 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.090
 also considered that done ad 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.440
 cross at the intersection from outside the area 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.180
 with the weak foot then there is a 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.349
 set of things they make anyway 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.250
 this is a very nice goal 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.410
 fortunately the phenomena as he said 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.630
 he is a celiac, especially from Libya 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.310
 which is nicknamed pierre emerick 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.370
 obama young and proper nickname is there 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.170
 written on the identity card burns 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.780
 caceres with its infinite speed e 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.810
 then he manages to throw the ball in for 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.180
 the goal of one to one however as I think 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.310
 you all know how to have excellent 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.959
 players often also coincide with non 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.430
 to be a really good player 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.840
 then walls and leaves on the strip 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.519
 right can do this beautiful 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:14.670
 goal with the outside of the foot to turn 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.980
 towards the second pole and immediately after the 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.380
 minute later I think muriel still with one 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.930
 stop beautiful with just the stop 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.730
 attacked the defender and then went to 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.590
 always conclude to always cross 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.480
 on that goal goal of 3 to 1 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.100
 and a few minutes later towards the end of 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.639
 first time just on the stroke of 40 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.590
 50 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:33.540
 he always walls and always on the right 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.489
 cross in for klose than head 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.750
 can really make a beautiful 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.970
 crazy goal 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.620
 the replay because klose head is 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.420
 really really a great player 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.400
 look you can take the time ea 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.079
 put it on the intersection so it's good at 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.670
 head and also very precise then 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.069
 really a great striker 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.560
 opponent of course like all those 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.790
 who have many players at the end of the first round 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.620
 time when they see that they are losing 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.409
 they retire 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.470
 so 41 very very easy as 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:02.459
 game easier than before 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.049
 because even those who were before were 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.879
 however dominating I was on 2 1 here 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.010
 instead 4 to 1 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:09.750
 there is also when I seat 11 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.220
 however in control therefore me 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.780
 like I like these games 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.209
 especially when you beat these teams 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.629
 very strong that then turn out to be 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.850
 blowjobs 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:22.560
 let's go to the third game and meet 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.169
 this player with an excellent aa series 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.699
 4 1 2 module that really use many 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.110
 I don't like it for the series though 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.300
 pleased them 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.680
 I always find good players if 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.060
 they use the series at most 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.370
 Sometimes they are good players presence was probably 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.020
 because they are Italian now except also 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.419
 patriotic but me when he met 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:43.590
 Italians always make effort to goal of 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:45.150
 vucinic 1 to 1 to 0 sorry don't 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.620
 regret the German as he scores goals 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.850
 head and then make another like it 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.580
 see the corner diamonds 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:54.780
 vucinic heads off for 2 to 0 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.550
 game that will end at 2 to 0 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.770
 then they manage to activate the game 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.660
 he also attacks the form a lot 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.650
 quite offensive I can keep 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.110
 starting off guard 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.389
 then it ends 2 to 0 so this too 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.330
 let's say two to zero fast enough then 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:11.490
 in control between great victories 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.860
 episode after the ugly one with 4 points 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.870
 last as there is not always today 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.280
 question why I didn't meet 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.780
 Andreini didn't give it to me because he is 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.729
 he is the graphic designer and can do nothing 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.740
 I will remember how to screen 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.849
 always write about our three things 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.039
 or the channel on the facebook page 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:28.050
 of the facebook group all the links are 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.699
 always in the description of the video and me 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.260
 I recommend always leave us a nice me 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:33.949
 like it and we feel at the next 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.949
 hello video
