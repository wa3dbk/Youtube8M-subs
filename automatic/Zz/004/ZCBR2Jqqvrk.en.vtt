Czajnikowy.pl - a good cup of tea!

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.200
It's getting warmer and warmer, so many of you 
are probably thinking of beer outside.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:20.200
What if we mixed beer with refreshing, 
energy-boosting and favorite yerba mate?

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.200
We have such a recipe. Stay with us 
and let me show you.

Tips concerning yerba mate

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.160
Hi and welcome! Today we'll show you
 something unusual, at least for me

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.260
cause as you know I do not drink alcohol 
while today we'll make mate with alcohol.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.260
It's a subject that we can often see recently. 
You write to us e-mails with questions

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:01.260
whether yerba mate can be combined with alcohol. 
Someone says he likes to drink a beer and mate

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:09.560
but he's afraid to drink both and one guy even wrote 
he's afraid to such extent that one day he drinks mate

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.160
and doesn't drink beer, on the other day he drinks 
beer but no mate and that's his evening system.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:21.960
Well, our questions are for a reason because 
some time ago it was loud about the harmfulness

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.460
of drinks with vodka with some
 energy boosting energy drinks.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.360
There it's true, there might be certain 
substances that will react but we did a research

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and caffeine with coffee does not react in any way. 
No new compounds are made, it's not harmful.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
There are many examples
 such as coffee with alcohol, Irish,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:58.000
some vodka with rum, tea with rum so combining
 caffeine with alcohol is nothing new.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.700
It's the same with mate. Other substances in mate 
don't react negatively with alcohol whatsoever.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:13.100
So you can go ahead and mix it but the only
 important thing that I found here

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:20.200
is that large amount of caffeine, while mate contains 
plenty, makes us not feel alcoholic intoxication.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.800
Well, it's for those who overdo it but the problem is 
that drinking too much caffeine we can overdo it with alcohol

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.300
without feeling drunk and we can be more drunk 
than we want. I don't recommend getting drunk

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.800
but here you must be really careful cause
 there's no moderation after mixing it.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.500
What we're gonna do today is not gonna be very high 
in percentages but what I enjoy isn't high in percentages at all

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.100
cause as an abstinent I have a non-alcoholic
 beer here which I'm gonna need just for taste.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.600
You can go ahead and try what you want. Mate cerveza 
is simply yerba mate poured over with cold beer.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:07.100
The word Cerveza itself means beer so the name isn't
 very unusual. Mate Cerveza which is mate with beer.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:14.200
The way you do it is pretty simple. We're gonna need
 some mate, pour some favorite mate

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.300
In our case it's this one, I don't know how fruit 
or herbal ones will work, we haven't tried it

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:29.900
but it's all in front of you. Yerba as much 
as you like, our standard two spoons, bombilla

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.400
and let's pour it over with cooled down beer.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.060
And it's done. No-brainer!

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:50.260
You must know it's not a really 
isolated way of pouring mate with beer

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:59.460
because yerba mate and brewery really go well together. There's 
a wide range of beers made with the addition of yerba mate.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.860
Just like weed is  added to beer, 
similarly mate is added to beer.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:10.060
Of course it's not done in Poland. 
The best of those beers is made in the USA

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:18.660
and it landed within the 25 best beers 
in the world, according to the ranking.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:25.460
It proves many people value that flavor 
and beer with mate is a really good idea.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.520
I I think we can recommend something like that. 
Let me taste it and I'll recommend it more honestly.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.480
It's pretty good, you, guys.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:43.280
I'm not keen on beer but here the aroma of beer
 and mate gave something really pleasant

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:51.280
Really tasty. I think if it was more cooled down 
as it heated a little, perfect refreshment

00:04:51.280 --> 00:05:00.780
for going out in the Sun outside. What's more,
 I think it doesn't attract any attention

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.180
so you can go ahead and easily drink it 
outside as it looks just like yerba mate.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.480
That's all for now, thank you very much 
and see you in our next episodes!
