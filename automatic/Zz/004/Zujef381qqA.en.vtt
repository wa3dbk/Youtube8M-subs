00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.249
 hello there is sheep 8 new version 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:10.759
 mobile system for iphone ipod touch 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:13.339
 and ipod 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.379
 new mobile operating system logical 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:18.770
 continuation and weight 7 is the same flat 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:21.200
 design the same animation as with 8 externally 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.910
 looks almost indistinguishable from ios 7 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.100
 This is just a new wallpaper and a new application. 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.840
 on the desktop, let's talk about 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.440
 They are now embedded and ibooks 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.440
 attachment 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.390
 but about all new 2 1 is a bug report from 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.280
 to report system errors 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.230
 straight to the floor exclusively for 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.520
 developers this program will only 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.770
 in this firmware version 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.239
 Well, the second application is that in 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.410
 translate means health is 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.210
 universal application for 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.100
 all sorts of gadgets to spy on 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.380
 health like pressure meters 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.480
 bluetooth weights and so on and for 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.010
 sports trackers can now be monitored 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.700
 for health using only one 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.710
 attachment 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.570
 definitely a convenient thing as it will allow 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.820
 get rid of most uncomfortable 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.500
 applications but in this version of health 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.840
 so little can be done 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.530
 you can only admire going back to 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.020
 Desktop 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.280
 changed the spotlight from this second it 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.290
 almost google 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.790
 now when searching for something on the screen 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.070
 not only those found will be displayed 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.130
 data in the phone but also on the Internet 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.750
 ios 8 beta 1 doesn’t work 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.299
 test it for now 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.220
 it is impossible therefore we go further to the application 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.619
 mail standard mail client has become 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.790
 resemble the mail box application now 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.549
 if the pull to the right opens 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.409
 shortcut menu such functionality to many 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.510
 like it but not new it is not new 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.619
 but there was a brilliant decision with 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.689
 deferred letters 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.130
 let's say you write to someone in the mail and 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.420
 suddenly you need to look at the mail 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.760
 print or sent 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.560
 just minimize the window and scroll 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.299
 see what you need and when 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.009
 looked you can safely return to 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.710
 the letter only needs to click on it 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.869
 I think it’s easy and convenient one of 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.970
 the expected things that have long been in 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.400
 android interactive notification so 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.799
 it looks on the lock screen usually 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.720
 seemingly with but with pulling sideways 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.880
 voila you can mark it as 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.829
 calculated right from here or answer 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.229
 This mini window opens in the upper 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.790
 we cook in it and need to answer 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.500
 understandably that the functional 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.470
 extends not only to the page 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.420
 blocking 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.580
 it works anywhere and with any 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.380
 running sentences comes normal 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.630
 notice and just pull down 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.490
 to open a familiar window in 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.770
 android this feature has been available for a long time 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.230
 but the hollow made a little more comfortable 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.880
 firstly the answer window itself 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.710
 can open with one touch 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.990
 and secondly, api is applicable that is 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.610
 Facebook application is valid right away 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.980
 from here like the truth is not quite 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.870
 I understand how useful it is but what 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.240
 the opportunity is there is an unequivocal 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.550
 plus notification line still appeared 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.380
 Widgets are not exactly those widgets that we 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.240
 everyone was waiting now for the standard stock 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.740
 reminders calendar you can change them 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.720
 sometimes delete and add 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.090
 there is a special pi so the developers 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.420
 will be able to add their own widgets 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.600
 more interesting pleasant changes in the window 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.610
 multitasking 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.500
 top list is now either 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.840
 favorite contacts or if it is not 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.400
 list of recent calls as you can see when 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.980
 click you can choose what to do 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.590
 contacts call write with m with video 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.540
 call or voice call with time on 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.280
 sirem despite the great desire 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.560
 get the Russian version of the assistant 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.989
 nothing came of it but there is one 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.620
 nice innovation from the world series 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.350
 time is it 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.780
 yes now siri can be run without hands 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.370
 only magic is true such an opportunity 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.739
 only available when connected to charging 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.480
 device i think in the future iphone 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.100
 will be special separate 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.580
 energy saving processor for this 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.220
 task 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.030
 so we are waiting for something like moto x but 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.920
 that's cool 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.750
 the possibility of Russian dictation 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.090
 text can be done anywhere 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.820
 where the keyboard opens click on 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.920
 microphone icon and rushed to Moscow 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.170
 very hot and it's sad 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.120
 You see in my chip more than 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.640
 cool but again in android and that is 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.890
 very very long time ago very much 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.570
 changed application msh first 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.670
 group messages appeared 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.709
 but in general it is now a full analogue 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.510
 Vatsap can now send voice and 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.150
 just pull the microphone up and 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.250
 hold to record went release and 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.650
 she is sent to cancel the recording 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.510
 you can not pull up and in the side of the same 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.400
 Feint ears can be done with the camera 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.150
 click here pull up to 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.459
 To make a photo 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.669
 release and it is sent if we pull 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:20.489
 in the side then video is recorded and the weight is 8 beta 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.410
 1 is very unstable now and a lot of 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.810
 the claimed apple doesn't work here yet 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.610
 as 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.620
 with flax at the exit in the fall will be added 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.690
 a huge number of new features one 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.250
 of which third-party keyboards are already 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.620
 Now it is known that over porting 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.470
 commands work svayp flexi and 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.080
 swift key slide on with it really 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.400
 not fundamentally important but now 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.290
 English version of the keyboard can be 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.240
 use the intuitive set 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.370
 the keyboard suggests words like 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.200
 anticipating what will happen next too 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.840
 quite a story which is 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.830
 almost any android smartphone 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.680
 interesting feature found 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.330
 usa users with ipx enabled dps 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.639
 in certain places on lokskrine 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.740
 It allows you to run applications associated 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.690
 with this place next to applestore already 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.130
 Now you can run like this 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.500
 apple stores 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.000
 among other minor changes to the appstore 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.950
 the ability to add to 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.260
 photos more videos again 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.910
 remember in the play also now 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.830
 developers will be able to sell immediately 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.200
 several offers with one discount 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.419
 click that is instead of 10 dollars for 10 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.100
 applications worth a dollar can 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.030
 sell let's say for five dollars i 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.400
 I think it will use 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.710
 popular with game developer of for 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.840
 families also came up with a good thing now 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.120
 when buying something on the phone child 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.500
 the device will first be notified 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.570
 adult with confirmation 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.190
 maybe something a child buy or all the same 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.530
 no added feature 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.150
 programming tachadi can be 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.640
 use fingerprint scanner 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.979
 not only when unlocking webstor but also 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.450
 in any application anywhere developers 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:48.010
 will now be able to add support 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.680
 tachadi in programs and games 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.690
 besides 8 supports gaming 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.220
 engine frost byte drunk apple 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.800
 demonstrated how the graph looks 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.720
 on iphone 5s and it is justly impressive 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.970
 also introduced support for new 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.800
 standards about angel generally in every way 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.800
 improved the life of gamers and complicated 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.050
 Developers and with 8 available on all those 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.510
 devices that support rs7 except 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.520
 iphone 4 their large number even 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.630
 old ipad 2 supports ios 8 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.300
 which is good news 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.970
 Well, what's missing in c 8 actually 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.440
 there is almost all wanted something 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.450
 the update is unequivocal a lot 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.520
 useful new features are missing only 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.240
 full desktop widgets and 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.910
 Russian siri 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.310
 that's basically all 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.720
 Yes, much has been peeped android this 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.390
 really so but do not forget 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:36.830
 that initially the whole android peeped 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.830
 with just about everything
