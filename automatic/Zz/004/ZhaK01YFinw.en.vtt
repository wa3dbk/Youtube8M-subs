come back and check on the morning
that's<00:02:29.780> exactly<00:02:30.200> what<00:02:30.290> we're<00:02:30.380> gonna<00:02:30.470> do

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.699 

there's<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.530> reason<00:03:22.709> that<00:03:22.980> this<00:03:23.100> works<00:03:23.370> so<00:03:23.550> well

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
there's a reason that this works so well

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.160 
there's a reason that this works so well
the<00:03:25.709> reason<00:03:26.069> is<00:03:26.160> that<00:03:26.190> a<00:03:26.600> lot<00:03:27.600> of<00:03:27.630> catfish

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
the reason is that a lot of catfish

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.140 
the reason is that a lot of catfish
anglers<00:03:28.650> that<00:03:28.709> are<00:03:28.920> new<00:03:29.040> to<00:03:29.069> the<00:03:29.220> sport<00:03:29.340> don't

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
anglers that are new to the sport don't

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.720 
anglers that are new to the sport don't
realize<00:03:30.540> that<00:03:30.900> at<00:03:31.110> night<00:03:31.400> catfish<00:03:32.400> like<00:03:32.580> to

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
realize that at night catfish like to

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.699 
realize that at night catfish like to
come<00:03:32.880> into<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.150> shallows<00:03:33.600> of<00:03:33.870> small<00:03:34.380> ponds

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
come into the shallows of small ponds

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.620 
come into the shallows of small ponds
and<00:03:35.010> lakes<00:03:36.110> but<00:03:37.110> right<00:03:37.380> up<00:03:37.560> near<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.130> shore

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
and lakes but right up near the shore

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.199 
and lakes but right up near the shore
and<00:03:39.630> so<00:03:40.140> you<00:03:40.200> can<00:03:40.380> leave<00:03:40.590> bait<00:03:41.430> overnight<00:03:41.940> very

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
and so you can leave bait overnight very

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.309 
and so you can leave bait overnight very
close<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.660> shore<00:03:42.720> and<00:03:43.200> they're

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
close to the shore and they're

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:44.360 
close to the shore and they're
eventually<00:03:43.470> gonna<00:03:43.770> find<00:03:44.069> it

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
eventually gonna find it

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.870 
eventually gonna find it

you're aiming for bigger fish to use

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.350 
you're aiming for bigger fish to use
thicker<00:05:43.940> stronger<00:05:44.300> line<00:05:45.580> because<00:05:46.580> you<00:05:47.090> really

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
thicker stronger line because you really

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.910 
thicker stronger line because you really
don't<00:05:47.540> know<00:05:47.690> what's<00:05:47.900> gonna<00:05:48.020> hit<00:05:48.290> it<00:05:48.470> I<00:05:48.590> know

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
before and so it's very likely that same

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.320 
before and so it's very likely that same
snapping<00:05:54.890> turtle<00:05:55.190> was<00:05:55.340> what<00:05:55.730> broke<00:05:55.910> this<00:05:56.120> line

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
snapping turtle was what broke this line

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.870 
snapping turtle was what broke this line
that's<00:05:56.720> it
