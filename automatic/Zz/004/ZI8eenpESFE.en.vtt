00:00:05.944 --> 00:00:07.570
 Hi, my name is Darek Kraśnicki 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.471
 and welcome on the website www.zwolnienielekarskie.pl 

00:00:12.771 --> 00:00:18.112
 In this video I would like to raise another interesting topic, connected at this moment 

00:00:18.112 --> 00:00:20.155
 with the start of the school year. 

00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:25.310
 Both school for students and the so-called academic year. 

00:00:29.814 --> 00:00:35.201
 It has become a tradition that both students and students start learning 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.935
 they start to ask doctors for so-called sick leave from PE 

00:00:42.214 --> 00:00:47.880
 and also to justify school activities due to illness. 

00:00:50.852 --> 00:00:54.474
 Especially, it does not surprise me at this level of PE classes, 

00:00:54.474 --> 00:00:59.722
 or the level of school activities that our colleges or our schools present 

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:06.920
 but to the point: do you really need these certificates or exemptions from PE? 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.496
 written doctor's certificate? 

00:01:12.307 --> 00:01:17.322
 This matter has been explained quite recently by the so-called The Zielona Góra Agreement 

00:01:17.322 --> 00:01:26.192
 and on the page of this agreement it is appropriate to clarify what to do in the event of a sick leave from school. 

00:01:29.118 --> 00:01:33.484
 According to the answer given by the Ministry of Education and Science 

00:01:33.484 --> 00:01:37.663
 December 1, 2005 

00:01:38.128 --> 00:01:48.160
 it turns out that the demands of teachers of both primary schools and junior high schools or universities 

00:01:50.202 --> 00:01:54.800
 issuing by doctors POZ-tu or other doctors excuses 

00:01:56.286 --> 00:02:02.280
 because of illness, written excuses for illness from school are simply unlawful. 

00:02:05.666 --> 00:02:10.780
 Such justifications have no justification in both education law 

00:02:11.425 --> 00:02:15.050
 as in the law of higher education. 

00:02:17.927 --> 00:02:21.360
 From this explanation it follows that at least theoretically 

00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:25.170
 students over 18 years of age 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.610
 they can justify themselves in schools themselves. 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:35.200
 As you know, a person who is 18 years old by civil code 

00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:38.960
 has full legal capacity. 

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:46.070
 However, the family code applies to students who are not 18 years old 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:54.890
 Article 92, which says that the child remains an adult under parental care. 

00:02:55.032 --> 00:02:59.680
 And it is parents who decide whether to justify such absence due to illness 

00:02:59.955 --> 00:03:04.090
 at school or school or not to justify. 

00:03:06.921 --> 00:03:11.840
 On the website of the Zielona Góra Agreement, there are scans of letters 

00:03:12.168 --> 00:03:15.230
 which shows that the ministry 

00:03:16.348 --> 00:03:19.320
 notified the school subordinate to each other 

00:03:19.506 --> 00:03:24.800
 on the principles of dismissing and justifying absence 

00:03:25.543 --> 00:03:28.050
 in schools because of illness. 

00:03:29.072 --> 00:03:33.210
 However, in practice it is different, as evidenced by the whole crowd of students 

00:03:34.413 --> 00:03:39.520
 walking privately or to a POZ-doctor 

00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:45.370
 and trying to get such written testimonies, justifications for inability to PE 

00:03:45.605 --> 00:03:49.640
 or incapacity due to illness. 

00:03:49.785 --> 00:03:54.010
 I can only at the end invite you to comment on this video 

00:03:55.357 --> 00:04:00.840
 here through the comments below. 

00:04:01.348 --> 00:04:07.430
 Is this doctor really needed to issue exemptions from PE and school?
