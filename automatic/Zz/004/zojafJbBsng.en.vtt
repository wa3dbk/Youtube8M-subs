00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
holding up well I've thrown the bike a

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.230 
holding up well I've thrown the bike a
little<00:01:13.439> bit<00:01:13.850> but<00:01:14.850> not<00:01:15.210> as<00:01:15.360> much<00:01:15.479> as<00:01:15.659> my<00:01:15.810> Eastern

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
little bit but not as much as my Eastern

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.899 
little bit but not as much as my Eastern
they<00:01:18.240> aren't<00:01:18.689> bending<00:01:19.080> or<00:01:19.200> anything<00:01:19.909> there's

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
they aren't bending or anything there's

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.520 
they aren't bending or anything there's
pretty<00:01:21.330> much<00:01:21.390> nothing<00:01:21.720> wrong<00:01:22.020> for<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.320> bars

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
pretty much nothing wrong for the bars

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.340 
pretty much nothing wrong for the bars
oh<00:01:23.509> down<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.810> stem<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.470> stem<00:01:25.530> sucks<00:01:26.340> like

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
oh down to the stem the stem sucks like

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.219 
oh down to the stem the stem sucks like
worst<00:01:28.350> em<00:01:28.710> ever<00:01:29.009> when<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.729> was<00:01:29.970> doing<00:01:30.360> jumps<00:01:31.079> I

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
worst em ever when I was doing jumps I

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.670 
worst em ever when I was doing jumps I
would<00:01:31.560> just<00:01:31.770> do<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> bunny<00:01:32.250> hop<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:33.409> the<00:01:34.409> bars

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
would just do a bunny hop and the bars

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.609 
would just do a bunny hop and the bars
would<00:01:34.950> go<00:01:35.070> backwards<00:01:35.700> like<00:01:35.880> by<00:01:36.780> 30<00:01:37.229> degrees<00:01:37.670> so

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
would go backwards like by 30 degrees so

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.260 
would go backwards like by 30 degrees so
if<00:01:40.619> you're<00:01:41.159> planning<00:01:41.430> on<00:01:41.610> getting<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:42.060> spike

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
if you're planning on getting a spike

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.850 
if you're planning on getting a spike
just<00:01:42.570> make<00:01:42.780> sure<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.049> have<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.409> right<00:01:43.560> tools

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
just make sure you have the right tools

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.310 
just make sure you have the right tools
to<00:01:44.189> tighten<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:45.030> bolts<00:01:45.360> like<00:01:45.509> all<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:46.170> way<00:01:46.320> up

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
to tighten the bolts like all the way up

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.569 
to tighten the bolts like all the way up
I'd<00:01:49.320> actually<00:01:49.799> don't<00:01:49.979> have<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.130> right<00:01:50.369> tools

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
I'd actually don't have the right tools

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.899

the alienation plane black rim I can't

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.910 
the alienation plane black rim I can't
say<00:02:34.720> that<00:02:34.870> five<00:02:35.050> times<00:02:35.080> really<00:02:35.470> fast<00:02:37.740> it<00:02:38.740> has

say that five times really fast it has
I'm<00:02:39.190> not<00:02:39.310> sure<00:02:39.430> what<00:02:39.580> kind<00:02:39.610> of<00:02:39.790> spokes<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.510> I'm

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
I'm not sure what kind of spokes and I'm

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.870 
I'm not sure what kind of spokes and I'm
pretty<00:02:41.320> sure<00:02:41.440> it<00:02:41.650> has<00:02:41.770> a<00:02:41.800> Katy<00:02:42.130> cuando<00:02:42.640> front

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
pretty sure it has a Katy cuando front

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.600 
pretty sure it has a Katy cuando front
hub<00:02:43.060> I<00:02:43.330> know<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.989> back<00:02:44.170> hub<00:02:44.470> is<00:02:44.650> Katy<00:02:44.980> cuando

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
hub I know the back hub is Katy cuando

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.680 
hub I know the back hub is Katy cuando
so<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.750> front<00:02:46.959> hub<00:02:47.080> must<00:02:47.320> be<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:49.090> frame<00:02:49.420> is

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
so the front hub must be to the frame is

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.210 
so the front hub must be to the frame is
kind<00:02:50.200> of<00:02:50.350> fat<00:02:52.080> I'm<00:02:53.080> guessing<00:02:53.560> that's<00:02:53.680> why<00:02:54.160> the

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
kind of fat I'm guessing that's why the

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.310 
kind of fat I'm guessing that's why the
bike<00:02:54.550> is<00:02:54.730> heavier<00:02:55.090> because<00:02:55.660> there's<00:02:55.989> not<00:02:56.140> much

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
bike is heavier because there's not much

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.250 
bike is heavier because there's not much
to<00:02:56.500> add<00:02:56.620> weight<00:02:56.980> on<00:02:57.190> it<00:02:57.780> except<00:02:58.780> for<00:02:58.810> maybe<00:02:59.050> the

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
to add weight on it except for maybe the

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.920 
to add weight on it except for maybe the
back<00:02:59.440> wheel<00:02:59.709> or<00:02:59.920> hug<00:03:00.070> or<00:03:00.220> something<00:03:00.580> but<00:03:00.970> it's

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
back wheel or hug or something but it's

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.900 
back wheel or hug or something but it's
holding<00:03:02.410> up<00:03:02.560> well<00:03:02.770> I<00:03:03.100> don't<00:03:03.640> have<00:03:03.730> any
