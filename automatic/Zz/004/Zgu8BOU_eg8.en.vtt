sick of seeing it I know anyway my
opponent<00:00:48.140> is<00:00:48.970> probably<00:00:49.970> not<00:00:50.120> the<00:00:50.180> most

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
opponent is probably not the most

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.149 
opponent is probably not the most
professional<00:00:50.750> so<00:00:51.229> it<00:00:51.379> wasn't<00:00:51.769> thinking<00:00:52.010> this

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:52.159 
professional so it wasn't thinking this

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:55.420 
professional so it wasn't thinking this
would<00:00:52.280> be<00:00:52.399> too<00:00:52.579> hard<00:00:52.850> anyway<00:00:53.979> we're<00:00:54.979> in<00:00:55.010> a<00:00:55.159> neon

would be too hard anyway we're in a neon

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.160 
would be too hard anyway we're in a neon
Coliseum<00:00:55.940> which<00:00:56.149> appears<00:00:56.449> to<00:00:56.570> be<00:00:56.659> floating<00:00:57.079> in

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170

Coliseum which appears to be floating in
mid-air<00:00:57.440> to<00:00:57.649> spite<00:00:57.890> the<00:00:58.010> fact<00:00:58.040> you<00:00:58.430> know<00:00:58.579> it's

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
maybe it's attached to the tower by some

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.780 
maybe it's attached to the tower by some
like<00:01:08.420> it's<00:01:09.290> held<00:01:09.500> up<00:01:09.560> by<00:01:09.770> duct<00:01:10.009> tape<00:01:10.280> probably
