00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.260 

and<00:00:12.190> today<00:00:12.670> I'm<00:00:12.730> going<00:00:12.820> to<00:00:12.940> show<00:00:13.030> you<00:00:13.090> how<00:00:13.210> to

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:13.270 
and today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:14.820 
and today I'm going to show you how to
replace<00:00:13.570> the<00:00:13.630> bear

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.830 
replace the bear

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.710 
replace the bear
your<00:00:14.950> hub<00:00:18.150> now<00:00:19.150> that<00:00:19.300> we<00:00:19.360> have<00:00:19.480> the<00:00:19.600> hub

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
your hub now that we have the hub

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.240 
your hub now that we have the hub
disassembled<00:00:20.350> are<00:00:20.439> ready<00:00:20.619> to<00:00:20.800> take<00:00:20.980> out<00:00:21.130> the

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
disassembled are ready to take out the

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.519 
disassembled are ready to take out the
bearings<00:00:21.640> the<00:00:22.480> setup<00:00:22.810> I<00:00:22.930> have<00:00:22.960> here<00:00:23.380> is<00:00:23.500> a

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
bearings the setup I have here is a

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.650 
bearings the setup I have here is a
couple<00:00:23.770> T<00:00:23.950> whiteboards<00:00:24.430> and<00:00:24.610> what<00:00:25.420> I've<00:00:25.509> done

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
couple T whiteboards and what I've done

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.839 
couple T whiteboards and what I've done
is<00:00:25.720> I'm<00:00:25.990> straddling<00:00:26.500> the<00:00:26.680> the<00:00:27.400> hub<00:00:27.580> on<00:00:27.730> those

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849 
is I'm straddling the the hub on those

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.019 
is I'm straddling the the hub on those
two<00:00:28.060> by<00:00:28.210> fours<00:00:28.480> such<00:00:29.439> that<00:00:29.740> most<00:00:30.640> of<00:00:30.790> the<00:00:30.880> hub

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
two by fours such that most of the hub

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.380 
two by fours such that most of the hub
flange<00:00:31.390> is<00:00:31.779> being<00:00:32.439> supported<00:00:32.949> by<00:00:32.980> the<00:00:33.100> 2x4<00:00:33.760> but

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
flange is being supported by the 2x4 but

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.939 
flange is being supported by the 2x4 but
I<00:00:34.420> still<00:00:34.750> have<00:00:34.900> enough<00:00:35.080> gap<00:00:35.290> between<00:00:35.559> the<00:00:35.830> two

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:35.949 
I still have enough gap between the two

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:38.759 
I still have enough gap between the two
by<00:00:36.070> fours<00:00:36.340> that<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.989> will<00:00:38.199> allow<00:00:38.290> the<00:00:38.440> bearing

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:38.769 
by fours that it will allow the bearing

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:40.020 
by fours that it will allow the bearing
to<00:00:38.800> pass<00:00:39.010> through<00:00:39.280> when<00:00:39.400> I<00:00:39.430> punch<00:00:39.670> it<00:00:39.790> out<00:00:39.879> on

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
to pass through when I punch it out on

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.470 
to pass through when I punch it out on
the<00:00:40.090> other<00:00:40.210> side<00:00:41.970> and<00:00:42.970> one<00:00:43.120> of<00:00:43.180> the<00:00:43.269> reasons

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
the other side and one of the reasons

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.330 
the other side and one of the reasons
for<00:00:43.540> using<00:00:43.720> wood<00:00:43.960> is<00:00:44.230> that<00:00:44.590> you<00:00:44.980> don't<00:00:45.160> want<00:00:45.280> to

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
for using wood is that you don't want to

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.299 
for using wood is that you don't want to
Mar<00:00:45.550> the<00:00:45.580> finish<00:00:46.000> of<00:00:46.210> your<00:00:46.269> hub<00:00:46.690> by<00:00:47.220> applying<00:00:48.220> a

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
Mar the finish of your hub by applying a

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:49.469 
Mar the finish of your hub by applying a
force<00:00:48.640> to<00:00:48.790> it<00:00:48.879> you<00:00:49.000> wouldn't<00:00:49.180> want<00:00:49.299> to<00:00:49.330> use<00:00:49.449> a

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:49.479 
force to it you wouldn't want to use a

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:51.750 
force to it you wouldn't want to use a
couple<00:00:49.720> blocks<00:00:50.470> of<00:00:50.710> Steel<00:00:50.949> or<00:00:51.220> put<00:00:51.489> this<00:00:51.580> in<00:00:51.699> a

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
couple blocks of Steel or put this in a

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.799 
couple blocks of Steel or put this in a
vise<00:00:51.940> or<00:00:52.089> anything<00:00:52.269> because<00:00:52.510> what's<00:00:52.690> gonna

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
vise or anything because what's gonna

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.560 
vise or anything because what's gonna
end<00:00:52.930> up<00:00:53.019> happening<00:00:53.580> of<00:00:54.580> the<00:00:54.640> flange<00:00:54.879> there<00:00:55.150> is

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
end up happening of the flange there is

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.049 
end up happening of the flange there is
gonna<00:00:55.870> get<00:00:55.989> all<00:00:56.140> chewed<00:00:56.440> up<00:00:56.620> so<00:00:57.220> what<00:00:57.850> you<00:00:57.909> want

gonna get all chewed up so what you want

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.759 
gonna get all chewed up so what you want
to<00:00:58.089> do<00:00:58.210> is<00:00:58.330> you<00:00:58.600> want<00:00:58.750> to<00:00:58.780> start<00:00:58.870> at<00:00:59.170> the<00:00:59.379> 12

o'clock position in that order
and<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.780> reason<00:01:17.049> I'm<00:01:17.170> specific<00:01:17.650> about<00:01:17.860> that

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
and the reason I'm specific about that

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.350 
and the reason I'm specific about that
is<00:01:18.250> that<00:01:18.369> you<00:01:18.490> want<00:01:18.700> that<00:01:18.820> bearing<00:01:19.090> to<00:01:19.210> come

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
is that you want that bearing to come

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.050 
is that you want that bearing to come
out<00:01:19.510> as<00:01:19.720> straight<00:01:20.140> as<00:01:20.290> possible<00:01:20.400> if<00:01:21.400> I<00:01:21.640> was<00:01:21.880> to

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
out as straight as possible if I was to

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.270 
out as straight as possible if I was to
just<00:01:22.290> put<00:01:23.290> the<00:01:23.380> screwdriver<00:01:23.620> in<00:01:23.950> here<00:01:24.100> and

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
just put the screwdriver in here and

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.040 
just put the screwdriver in here and
just<00:01:24.430> bash<00:01:24.640> away<00:01:24.850> and<00:01:25.300> I'm<00:01:25.390> only<00:01:25.600> hitting<00:01:25.840> that

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
just bash away and I'm only hitting that

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.050 
just bash away and I'm only hitting that
12<00:01:26.290> o'clock<00:01:26.560> position<00:01:26.590> every<00:01:27.220> time<00:01:27.250> what's

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
12 o'clock position every time what's

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.340 
12 o'clock position every time what's
the<00:01:28.150> end<00:01:28.270> up<00:01:28.420> happening<00:01:28.750> is<00:01:28.900> that<00:01:28.930> bearings

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
the end up happening is that bearings

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.890 
the end up happening is that bearings
are<00:01:29.410> gonna<00:01:29.500> come<00:01:29.740> out<00:01:29.770> cockeyed<00:01:30.310> and<00:01:30.900> that's

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
are gonna come out cockeyed and that's

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.030 
are gonna come out cockeyed and that's
gonna<00:01:32.020> oval<00:01:32.380> eyes<00:01:32.470> the<00:01:32.650> opening<00:01:32.920> in<00:01:33.010> your

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
gonna oval eyes the opening in your

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.830 
gonna oval eyes the opening in your
bearing<00:01:33.460> or<00:01:33.790> in<00:01:34.030> your<00:01:34.180> how<00:01:34.540> about<00:01:34.660> I<00:01:34.690> should

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
bearing or in your how about I should

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.200 
bearing or in your how about I should
say<00:01:35.020> and<00:01:35.340> basically<00:01:36.340> your<00:01:36.520> hub<00:01:36.640> is<00:01:36.760> garbage<00:01:37.060> at

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
say and basically your hub is garbage at

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
say and basically your hub is garbage at
that<00:01:37.360> point<00:01:37.570> so<00:01:37.660> you<00:01:37.720> want<00:01:37.870> to<00:01:37.930> be<00:01:38.020> very

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230 
that point so you want to be very

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.080 
that point so you want to be very
careful<00:01:38.650> in<00:01:38.740> this<00:01:38.860> step<00:01:39.100> to<00:01:39.640> remove<00:01:39.820> the

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
careful in this step to remove the

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.020 
careful in this step to remove the
bearing<00:01:40.480> as<00:01:40.750> slowly<00:01:41.020> as<00:01:41.260> possible<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.880> more

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
bearing as slowly as possible the more

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.970 
bearing as slowly as possible the more
your<00:01:43.210> alternating<00:01:43.630> there<00:01:43.870> the<00:01:44.080> safer<00:01:44.860> it's

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
your alternating there the safer it's

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:45.960 
your alternating there the safer it's
going<00:01:45.100> to<00:01:45.159> be<00:01:45.250> for<00:01:45.460> you<00:01:45.520> removing<00:01:45.880> that

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
going to be for you removing that

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.360 
going to be for you removing that
bearing<00:01:46.300> and<00:01:46.480> the<00:01:47.440> chances<00:01:47.800> of<00:01:47.830> you<00:01:47.980> overlies

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
bearing and the chances of you overlies

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.180 
bearing and the chances of you overlies
in<00:01:48.550> the<00:01:48.700> hub<00:01:48.880> are<00:01:49.140> quite<00:01:50.140> slim<00:01:50.470> if<00:01:50.590> you<00:01:50.740> do<00:01:50.980> this

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
in the hub are quite slim if you do this

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.230 
in the hub are quite slim if you do this
slowly<00:01:51.460> and<00:01:51.730> properly<00:01:53.550> so<00:01:54.550> what<00:01:54.909> I'm<00:01:54.970> gonna<00:01:55.090> do

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
slowly and properly so what I'm gonna do

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.040 
slowly and properly so what I'm gonna do
is<00:01:55.360> start<00:01:55.510> at<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.690> 12<00:01:55.930> o'clock<00:01:55.990> position

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
is start at the 12 o'clock position

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.460 
is start at the 12 o'clock position
couple<00:01:59.050> light<00:01:59.229> tabs<00:02:00.960> over<00:02:01.960> to<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.229> six

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
couple light tabs over to the six

over to the nine o'clock position a

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.309 
over to the nine o'clock position a
couple<00:02:08.920> light<00:02:09.069> taps<00:02:09.340> and<00:02:10.110> finally<00:02:11.110> to<00:02:11.290> the

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
couple light taps and finally to the

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.070 
couple light taps and finally to the
three<00:02:11.709> o'clock<00:02:11.920> position<00:02:11.950> a<00:02:12.610> couple<00:02:13.080> more

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
three o'clock position a couple more

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.660 
three o'clock position a couple more
times<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.650> I'm<00:02:14.830> going<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:14.980> keep<00:02:15.129> going<00:02:15.310> around

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
times and I'm going to keep going around

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.880 
times and I'm going to keep going around
that<00:02:15.819> rotation<00:02:16.450> until<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:17.349> bearing<00:02:17.680> comes

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
that rotation until the bearing comes

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.030 
that rotation until the bearing comes
out<00:02:18.099> and<00:02:18.750> each<00:02:19.750> time<00:02:19.959> I

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
out and each time I

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.490 
out and each time I
I<00:02:21.129> was<00:02:21.700> actually<00:02:21.819> quite<00:02:22.030> quick<00:02:22.379> I'm<00:02:23.379> gonna

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
I was actually quite quick I'm gonna

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.809 
I was actually quite quick I'm gonna
have<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.739> do<00:02:23.829> that<00:02:23.950> several<00:02:24.219> times<00:02:24.340> going

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
have to do that several times going

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:25.890 
have to do that several times going
around<00:02:24.969> on<00:02:25.060> that<00:02:25.150> pattern<00:02:25.390> before<00:02:25.629> the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
around on that pattern before the

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.410 
around on that pattern before the
bearing<00:02:26.140> does<00:02:26.290> pop<00:02:26.530> out<00:02:26.739> this<00:02:27.730> particular<00:02:28.239> one

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
bearing does pop out this particular one

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.339 
bearing does pop out this particular one
was<00:02:29.730> coming<00:02:30.730> out<00:02:30.790> quite<00:02:31.000> easy<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:32.230> one

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
was coming out quite easy and the one

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:33.330 
was coming out quite easy and the one
thing<00:02:32.500> you<00:02:32.560> want<00:02:32.709> to<00:02:32.769> remember<00:02:32.890> about<00:02:33.040> this

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
thing you want to remember about this

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.720 
thing you want to remember about this
method<00:02:33.730> also<00:02:33.879> of<00:02:34.450> removal<00:02:34.959> is<00:02:35.140> that<00:02:35.730> the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
method also of removal is that the

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.319 
method also of removal is that the
bearing

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
bearing

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.599 
bearing
once<00:02:37.599> it<00:02:37.780> gets<00:02:38.140> popped<00:02:38.470> out<00:02:38.650> chances<00:02:39.489> are

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:39.609 
once it gets popped out chances are

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:41.009 
once it gets popped out chances are
pretty<00:02:39.730> good<00:02:39.849> this<00:02:40.060> is<00:02:40.239> garbage<00:02:40.480> because<00:02:40.870> what

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
pretty good this is garbage because what

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.619 
pretty good this is garbage because what
we're<00:02:41.170> end<00:02:41.290> up<00:02:41.439> what<00:02:41.950> we<00:02:42.099> have<00:02:42.970> done<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.390> remove

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
we're end up what we have done to remove

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:44.940 
we're end up what we have done to remove
it<00:02:43.780> is<00:02:43.930> we're<00:02:44.349> actually<00:02:44.409> hitting<00:02:44.769> this

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
it is we're actually hitting this

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.039 
it is we're actually hitting this
surface<00:02:45.340> here<00:02:45.549> and<00:02:45.790> I<00:02:46.569> can<00:02:46.720> see<00:02:46.840> in<00:02:46.930> this

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
surface here and I can see in this

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.289 
surface here and I can see in this
particular<00:02:47.319> bearing<00:02:47.859> that<00:02:48.129> the<00:02:48.879> seal<00:02:49.150> has

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
particular bearing that the seal has

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.129 
particular bearing that the seal has
been<00:02:49.480> damaged<00:02:49.930> in<00:02:50.139> doing<00:02:50.469> so<00:02:50.709> so<00:02:51.810> this<00:02:52.810> is<00:02:52.989> not

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139 
been damaged in doing so so this is not

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.449 
been damaged in doing so so this is not
a<00:02:53.170> method<00:02:53.409> you<00:02:53.590> want<00:02:53.680> to<00:02:53.799> use<00:02:53.950> if<00:02:54.129> you<00:02:54.220> want<00:02:54.400> to

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
a method you want to use if you want to

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:01.259 
a method you want to use if you want to
retain<00:02:54.730> those<00:02:54.970> bearings<00:02:55.420> for<00:02:55.780> future<00:02:56.170> use<00:03:00.269> the

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
retain those bearings for future use the

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:02.879 
retain those bearings for future use the
second<00:03:01.599> method<00:03:01.720> you<00:03:01.959> can<00:03:02.109> use<00:03:02.139> to<00:03:02.530> remove<00:03:02.739> your

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:02.889 
second method you can use to remove your

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:04.679 
second method you can use to remove your
bearing<00:03:03.220> is<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.489> use<00:03:03.700> what's<00:03:03.970> called<00:03:04.060> a<00:03:04.329> blind

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:04.689 
bearing is to use what's called a blind

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.349 
bearing is to use what's called a blind
hole<00:03:04.989> puller<00:03:05.459> blind<00:03:06.459> hole<00:03:06.609> puller<00:03:06.909> looks<00:03:07.180> like

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
hole puller blind hole puller looks like

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:09.119 
hole puller blind hole puller looks like
this<00:03:07.569> they<00:03:07.870> come<00:03:08.049> in<00:03:08.139> to<00:03:08.200> varying<00:03:08.439> sizes<00:03:08.739> and

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
this they come in to varying sizes and

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.250 
this they come in to varying sizes and
you<00:03:09.849> basically<00:03:10.000> want<00:03:10.239> to<00:03:10.359> get<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.569> size<00:03:10.810> that

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
you basically want to get the size that

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.940 
you basically want to get the size that
has<00:03:12.250> an<00:03:12.489> end<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:14.200> will<00:03:14.319> pass<00:03:14.530> through<00:03:14.829> your

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
has an end that will pass through your

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.190 
has an end that will pass through your
bearing<00:03:15.370> and<00:03:15.849> basically<00:03:16.720> what<00:03:16.900> this<00:03:17.049> tool

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
bearing and basically what this tool

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.809 
bearing and basically what this tool
does<00:03:17.260> is<00:03:17.590> you<00:03:17.709> put<00:03:17.950> it<00:03:18.250> through<00:03:18.370> your<00:03:18.430> bearing

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
does is you put it through your bearing

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.479 
does is you put it through your bearing
and<00:03:19.060> then<00:03:19.840> you'll<00:03:19.989> turn<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.560> truck<00:03:21.340> at

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
and then you'll turn the the truck at

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.129 
and then you'll turn the the truck at
the<00:03:21.579> end<00:03:21.730> here<00:03:22.000> and<00:03:22.540> what<00:03:22.689> that<00:03:22.810> does<00:03:22.989> is

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
the end here and what that does is

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:24.869 
the end here and what that does is
that'll<00:03:23.379> pass<00:03:23.500> a<00:03:23.739> shaft<00:03:24.370> through<00:03:24.609> the<00:03:24.760> end

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
that'll pass a shaft through the end

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.490 
that'll pass a shaft through the end
here<00:03:25.090> and<00:03:25.269> I'm<00:03:25.810> not<00:03:25.930> sure<00:03:26.049> if<00:03:26.139> you<00:03:26.199> can<00:03:26.290> see

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
here and I'm not sure if you can see

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.969 
here and I'm not sure if you can see
that<00:03:26.650> but<00:03:26.889> the<00:03:26.949> end<00:03:27.069> is<00:03:27.220> basically<00:03:28.769> cut<00:03:29.769> into

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:29.979 
that but the end is basically cut into

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:31.830 
that but the end is basically cut into
four<00:03:30.190> sections<00:03:30.489> and<00:03:30.970> what<00:03:31.090> will<00:03:31.180> happen<00:03:31.269> is<00:03:31.510> as

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
four sections and what will happen is as

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.300 
four sections and what will happen is as
that<00:03:32.019> shaft<00:03:32.260> is<00:03:32.409> coming<00:03:32.709> up<00:03:32.799> through<00:03:32.949> there

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
that shaft is coming up through there

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.240 
that shaft is coming up through there
that<00:03:33.729> will<00:03:34.030> force<00:03:34.629> the<00:03:34.810> end<00:03:34.959> to<00:03:35.409> splay<00:03:35.829> out<00:03:35.859> and

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
that will force the end to splay out and

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.759 
that will force the end to splay out and
that<00:03:37.180> end<00:03:37.449> is<00:03:37.629> what's<00:03:37.810> gonna<00:03:37.930> grip<00:03:38.169> the<00:03:38.199> inside

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
that end is what's gonna grip the inside

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.000 
that end is what's gonna grip the inside
diameter<00:03:39.159> of<00:03:39.519> the<00:03:39.609> bearing<00:03:39.970> on<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.690> inside<00:03:41.079> so

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
diameter of the bearing on the inside so

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.140 
diameter of the bearing on the inside so
I'll<00:03:42.190> show<00:03:42.340> you<00:03:42.430> in<00:03:42.489> a<00:03:42.519> second<00:03:42.790> here<00:03:42.879> what<00:03:43.060> that

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
I'll show you in a second here what that

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.080 
I'll show you in a second here what that
looks<00:03:43.329> like<00:03:43.389> when<00:03:43.629> it's<00:03:43.810> inside<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.709> bearing

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.189 

okay<00:03:49.090> and<00:03:49.239> now<00:03:49.299> I<00:03:49.329> have<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.629> tool<00:03:49.810> on<00:03:50.079> the

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:50.199 
okay and now I have the tool on the

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:53.399 
okay and now I have the tool on the
inside<00:03:50.530> of<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:51.180> hub<00:03:52.180> bearing<00:03:52.449> and<00:03:52.810> I'm<00:03:53.319> gonna

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:53.409 
inside of the hub bearing and I'm gonna

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:55.319 
inside of the hub bearing and I'm gonna
keep<00:03:53.590> turning<00:03:53.919> that<00:03:53.949> until<00:03:54.609> the<00:03:54.760> end<00:03:54.790> splays

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
keep turning that until the end splays

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.050 
keep turning that until the end splays
out<00:03:56.579> and<00:03:57.579> now<00:03:58.090> it's<00:03:58.239> quite<00:03:58.419> tight<00:03:58.599> and<00:03:58.870> what

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
out and now it's quite tight and what

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.699 
out and now it's quite tight and what
I'll<00:04:01.060> do<00:04:01.239> with<00:04:01.359> it<00:04:01.479> now<00:04:01.599> is<00:04:01.780> put<00:04:01.959> it<00:04:02.079> on<00:04:02.199> to<00:04:02.560> the

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
I'll do with it now is put it on to the

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:11.429 
I'll do with it now is put it on to the
end<00:04:02.889> of<00:04:03.129> this<00:04:03.400> shaft<00:04:09.599> and<00:04:10.599> then<00:04:11.139> what<00:04:11.229> I'll<00:04:11.319> do

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 
end of this shaft and then what I'll do

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:13.530 
end of this shaft and then what I'll do
is<00:04:11.560> hold<00:04:11.709> on<00:04:11.859> to<00:04:12.129> the<00:04:12.340> hub<00:04:12.489> shell<00:04:12.729> itself<00:04:13.030> and

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
is hold on to the hub shell itself and

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.180 
is hold on to the hub shell itself and
it's<00:04:14.379> this<00:04:14.650> tool<00:04:14.859> has<00:04:15.069> a<00:04:15.239> shaft<00:04:16.239> here<00:04:16.510> and<00:04:16.780> this

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
it's this tool has a shaft here and this

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.159 
it's this tool has a shaft here and this
large<00:04:18.190> weight<00:04:18.430> and<00:04:18.880> what<00:04:19.479> I<00:04:19.509> do<00:04:19.630> is<00:04:19.870> end<00:04:20.049> up

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
large weight and what I do is end up

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:21.210 
large weight and what I do is end up
pulling<00:04:20.320> that<00:04:20.470> weights<00:04:20.680> at<00:04:20.859> the<00:04:20.949> end<00:04:21.070> of<00:04:21.159> the

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
pulling that weights at the end of the

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.460 
pulling that weights at the end of the
shaft<00:04:21.400> and<00:04:21.940> once<00:04:22.389> it<00:04:22.539> hits<00:04:22.659> that<00:04:22.900> dead<00:04:23.169> end

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
shaft and once it hits that dead end

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.320 
shaft and once it hits that dead end
that's<00:04:24.070> what's<00:04:24.370> going<00:04:24.639> to<00:04:24.729> apply<00:04:25.270> the

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
that's what's going to apply the

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.540 
that's what's going to apply the
pressure<00:04:25.539> to<00:04:25.990> remove<00:04:26.289> the<00:04:27.039> bearing<00:04:27.310> from<00:04:27.460> the

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
pressure to remove the bearing from the

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.999 
pressure to remove the bearing from the
hub<00:04:27.729> so<00:04:28.060> I'll<00:04:28.780> just

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:36.240 

and<00:04:33.030> there<00:04:34.030> we<00:04:34.150> have<00:04:34.330> the<00:04:34.979> bearing<00:04:35.979> remove

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
and there we have the bearing remove

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.909 
and there we have the bearing remove
from<00:04:36.430> the<00:04:36.520> hook<00:04:36.669> and<00:04:37.440> it's<00:04:38.440> just<00:04:38.680> sitting<00:04:38.830> on

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
from the hook and it's just sitting on

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:40.110 
from the hook and it's just sitting on
the<00:04:39.009> end<00:04:39.100> of<00:04:39.160> the<00:04:39.220> shaft<00:04:39.430> and<00:04:39.669> now<00:04:39.820> I<00:04:39.850> can

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
the end of the shaft and now I can

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.999 
the end of the shaft and now I can
reduce<00:04:40.570> the<00:04:40.870> diameter<00:04:41.259> of<00:04:41.289> that<00:04:41.380> shaft<00:04:41.710> again

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.009 
reduce the diameter of that shaft again

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:43.740 
reduce the diameter of that shaft again
and<00:04:42.190> then<00:04:42.610> I'm<00:04:42.729> gonna<00:04:42.850> get<00:04:43.120> be<00:04:43.389> able<00:04:43.449> to<00:04:43.570> get<00:04:43.660> my

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
and then I'm gonna get be able to get my

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.439 
and then I'm gonna get be able to get my
bearing<00:04:44.050> off<00:04:44.199> there<00:04:47.759> okay<00:04:48.789> now<00:04:49.030> I'm<00:04:49.150> able<00:04:49.270> to

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
bearing off there okay now I'm able to

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:50.790 
bearing off there okay now I'm able to
remove<00:04:49.600> the<00:04:49.780> bearing<00:04:50.080> from<00:04:50.380> the<00:04:50.530> end<00:04:50.650> of<00:04:50.740> the

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
remove the bearing from the end of the

remove the bearing from the end of the
blind<00:04:51.220> hole<00:04:51.370> puller<00:04:51.580> I've<00:04:52.180> reduced<00:04:52.570> the<00:04:52.840> shaft

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
blind hole puller I've reduced the shaft

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.110 
blind hole puller I've reduced the shaft
diameter<00:04:53.830> and<00:04:54.039> it<00:04:54.550> should<00:04:54.759> just<00:04:54.850> pop<00:04:55.060> right

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
diameter and it should just pop right

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.710 
diameter and it should just pop right
off<00:04:55.360> the<00:04:55.539> end<00:04:55.660> there<00:04:59.610> and<00:05:00.610> now<00:05:01.419> I<00:05:01.449> have<00:05:01.690> a

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.589 
little larger than the hole on the other
side<00:05:47.250> if<00:05:48.250> you<00:05:48.849> don't<00:05:49.000> have<00:05:49.180> one<00:05:49.449> of<00:05:49.539> these

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
outside diameter your bearing your best

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.230 
outside diameter your bearing your best
bet<00:05:53.710> then<00:05:53.889> is<00:05:54.039> to<00:05:54.159> actually<00:05:54.280> use<00:05:54.460> one<00:05:54.849> of<00:05:54.970> your

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
bet then is to actually use one of your

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.680 
bet then is to actually use one of your
original<00:05:56.169> bearings<00:05:56.680> to<00:05:57.460> use<00:05:57.669> on<00:05:57.940> top<00:05:57.970> of<00:05:58.389> your

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
original bearings to use on top of your

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.909 
original bearings to use on top of your
new<00:05:58.900> bearing<00:05:59.289> to<00:05:59.620> install<00:06:00.190> or<00:06:00.370> to<00:06:00.490> press<00:06:00.729> in<00:06:00.940> in

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
new bearing to install or to press in in

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.620 
new bearing to install or to press in in
my<00:06:02.919> particular<00:06:03.220> case<00:06:03.610> I<00:06:03.789> don't<00:06:03.849> have<00:06:04.150> a<00:06:04.180> nylon

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
my particular case I don't have a nylon

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.439 
my particular case I don't have a nylon
piece<00:06:05.470> that<00:06:05.740> does<00:06:05.949> match<00:06:06.460> the<00:06:06.490> exact<00:06:07.060> inside

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:07.449 
piece that does match the exact inside

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:08.730 
piece that does match the exact inside
diameter<00:06:07.599> so<00:06:07.960> I'm<00:06:08.080> going<00:06:08.199> to<00:06:08.229> use<00:06:08.409> my<00:06:08.560> original

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
diameter so I'm going to use my original

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:14.420 
diameter so I'm going to use my original
bearing<00:06:09.220> there<00:06:09.340> to<00:06:09.460> push<00:06:09.639> that<00:06:09.759> back<00:06:09.940> in

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.920 

okay<00:06:15.430> now<00:06:15.640> I've<00:06:15.730> got<00:06:15.790> my<00:06:16.000> very<00:06:16.210> install<00:06:16.660> tools

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
okay now I've got my very install tools

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.170 
okay now I've got my very install tools
set<00:06:17.170> up<00:06:17.290> and<00:06:17.890> what<00:06:18.460> I've<00:06:18.550> done<00:06:18.670> here<00:06:18.880> is<00:06:18.940> I've

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
set up and what I've done here is I've

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.210 
set up and what I've done here is I've
got<00:06:19.330> my<00:06:19.360> new<00:06:19.570> bearing<00:06:19.900> on<00:06:20.020> the<00:06:20.140> inside<00:06:20.500> I've

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.220 
got my new bearing on the inside I've

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.670 
got my new bearing on the inside I've
got<00:06:21.580> my<00:06:21.760> old<00:06:21.940> bearing<00:06:22.360> just<00:06:23.110> outside<00:06:23.410> of<00:06:23.560> that

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
got my old bearing just outside of that

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.540 
got my old bearing just outside of that
and<00:06:23.920> then<00:06:24.700> I've<00:06:24.850> got<00:06:25.060> the<00:06:25.330> nylon<00:06:26.050> piece<00:06:26.550> which

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
and then I've got the nylon piece which

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.250 
and then I've got the nylon piece which
is<00:06:27.580> just<00:06:28.120> slightly<00:06:28.270> larger<00:06:28.720> than<00:06:28.750> the<00:06:29.020> outside

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.260 
is just slightly larger than the outside

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.560 
is just slightly larger than the outside
diameter<00:06:29.440> of<00:06:29.710> my<00:06:29.860> bearing<00:06:30.220> and<00:06:30.850> on<00:06:31.480> the

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
diameter of my bearing and on the

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.990 
diameter of my bearing and on the
opposite<00:06:31.840> side<00:06:32.080> I've<00:06:32.980> got<00:06:33.010> another<00:06:33.610> nylon

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
opposite side I've got another nylon

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.750 
opposite side I've got another nylon
piece<00:06:34.240> and<00:06:35.010> the<00:06:36.010> way<00:06:36.130> I've<00:06:36.220> chosen<00:06:36.430> this<00:06:36.580> one

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:36.760 
piece and the way I've chosen this one

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.760 
piece and the way I've chosen this one
is<00:06:36.940> I'm<00:06:37.090> just<00:06:37.120> making<00:06:37.570> sure<00:06:37.600> that<00:06:37.770> the

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:38.770 
is I'm just making sure that the

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.070 
is I'm just making sure that the
diameter<00:06:39.460> of<00:06:39.490> this<00:06:39.670> one<00:06:39.880> is<00:06:40.180> larger<00:06:40.720> than<00:06:40.870> the

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
diameter of this one is larger than the

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.740 
diameter of this one is larger than the
hole<00:06:41.200> for<00:06:41.590> the<00:06:41.710> bearing<00:06:41.950> and<00:06:42.390> I'm<00:06:43.390> basically

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:43.750 
hole for the bearing and I'm basically

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.960 
hole for the bearing and I'm basically
ready<00:06:43.930> now<00:06:44.170> to<00:06:44.620> press<00:06:45.100> my<00:06:45.250> bearing<00:06:45.490> back<00:06:45.670> in<00:06:45.850> a

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:45.970 
ready now to press my bearing back in a

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.400 
ready now to press my bearing back in a
couple<00:06:46.600> things<00:06:46.690> you<00:06:46.870> want<00:06:47.020> to<00:06:47.050> note<00:06:47.230> before

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:47.410 
couple things you want to note before

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.260 
couple things you want to note before
starting<00:06:47.890> to<00:06:47.980> do<00:06:48.130> so<00:06:48.340> is<00:06:48.700> you<00:06:48.910> want<00:06:49.090> to<00:06:49.150> make

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 
starting to do so is you want to make

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.600 
starting to do so is you want to make
sure<00:06:49.300> that<00:06:49.800> everything<00:06:50.800> is<00:06:50.920> lined<00:06:51.220> up<00:06:51.370> as

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
sure that everything is lined up as

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.140 
sure that everything is lined up as
straight<00:06:52.330> as<00:06:52.810> possible<00:06:53.710> so<00:06:54.670> that<00:06:54.910> when<00:06:55.030> you

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.150 
straight as possible so that when you

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.520 
straight as possible so that when you
start<00:06:55.360> to<00:06:55.420> press<00:06:55.570> the<00:06:55.720> bearing<00:06:55.870> back<00:06:56.110> in<00:06:56.320> it

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:56.530 
start to press the bearing back in it

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.160 
start to press the bearing back in it
goes<00:06:56.680> in<00:06:56.890> straight<00:06:57.480> so<00:06:58.480> what<00:06:58.810> I'm<00:06:58.900> gonna<00:06:58.990> do

00:06:59.160 --> 00:06:59.170 
goes in straight so what I'm gonna do

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:04.190 
goes in straight so what I'm gonna do
now<00:06:59.290> is<00:06:59.530> grab<00:07:00.100> my<00:07:00.600> six<00:07:01.600> millimeter<00:07:02.880> hex<00:07:03.880> key

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:04.200 
now is grab my six millimeter hex key

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.050 
now is grab my six millimeter hex key
insert<00:07:05.200> that<00:07:05.320> into<00:07:05.530> one<00:07:05.680> side<00:07:05.920> and<00:07:06.930> my<00:07:07.930> 13<00:07:08.710> mil

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.060 
insert that into one side and my 13 mil

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.180 
insert that into one side and my 13 mil
wrench<00:07:10.060> on<00:07:10.390> the<00:07:10.600> other<00:07:10.690> and<00:07:11.140> I'm<00:07:11.830> just<00:07:12.010> going

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:12.190 
wrench on the other and I'm just going

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.360 
wrench on the other and I'm just going
to<00:07:12.220> gently<00:07:12.460> tighten<00:07:13.120> that<00:07:13.390> and<00:07:13.950> as<00:07:14.950> I'm<00:07:15.190> doing

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:15.370 
to gently tighten that and as I'm doing

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.870 
to gently tighten that and as I'm doing
so<00:07:15.700> I'm<00:07:15.880> keeping<00:07:16.150> an<00:07:16.390> eye<00:07:16.510> on<00:07:17.400> this<00:07:18.400> side<00:07:18.640> here

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:18.880 
so I'm keeping an eye on this side here

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.000 
so I'm keeping an eye on this side here
to<00:07:19.480> make<00:07:19.660> sure<00:07:19.840> that<00:07:20.050> that<00:07:20.200> bearing<00:07:20.620> is<00:07:20.740> going

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.010 
to make sure that that bearing is going

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:25.350 
to make sure that that bearing is going
in<00:07:21.160> straight<00:07:22.950> so<00:07:23.950> far<00:07:23.980> so<00:07:24.400> good<00:07:24.580> it's<00:07:24.790> going<00:07:25.030> in

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 
in straight so far so good it's going in

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.010 
in straight so far so good it's going in
quite<00:07:26.020> straight<00:07:27.330> and<00:07:28.330> you<00:07:28.450> basically<00:07:28.720> want<00:07:28.960> to

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:29.020 
quite straight and you basically want to

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.860 
quite straight and you basically want to
keep<00:07:29.170> going<00:07:29.380> until<00:07:29.770> you<00:07:30.610> start<00:07:30.910> to<00:07:31.030> feel<00:07:31.300> some

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:31.870 
keep going until you start to feel some

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.210 
keep going until you start to feel some
resistance<00:07:32.050> and<00:07:32.910> then<00:07:33.910> you<00:07:34.060> maybe<00:07:34.240> want<00:07:34.540> to<00:07:34.600> go

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:35.220 
resistance and then you maybe want to go

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.310 
resistance and then you maybe want to go
1/8<00:07:36.220> to<00:07:36.520> 1/4<00:07:36.820> of<00:07:37.000> a<00:07:37.090> turn<00:07:37.270> past<00:07:37.630> that<00:07:37.960> and

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:38.320 
1/8 to 1/4 of a turn past that and

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.320 
1/8 to 1/4 of a turn past that and
that's<00:07:38.830> basically<00:07:39.280> the<00:07:39.460> point<00:07:39.700> where<00:07:39.940> your

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:40.330 
that's basically the point where your

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.190
