they're kind of taking what they had in

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.649 
they're kind of taking what they had in
battle<00:01:37.770> for<00:01:37.890> three<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.310> adding<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.119> much<00:01:39.149> more

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
battle for three and adding so much more

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.050 
battle for three and adding so much more
to<00:01:39.929> it<00:01:40.109> battlefield<00:01:41.039> 3<00:01:41.219> didn't<00:01:41.460> add<00:01:41.579> camos

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
to it battlefield 3 didn't add camos

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.209 
to it battlefield 3 didn't add camos
until<00:01:42.450> about<00:01:42.689> halfway<00:01:43.049> through<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.920> game's

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:44.219 
until about halfway through the game's

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:46.760 
until about halfway through the game's
release<00:01:44.609> and<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.450> think<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.350> was<00:01:46.469> a<00:01:46.499> bad

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
release and I think that was a bad

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.620 
release and I think that was a bad
decision<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.460> be<00:01:47.549> honest<00:01:47.850> because<00:01:47.999> when<00:01:48.420> come

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.370 
something really cool in my opinion you
will<00:03:33.030> kind<00:03:33.270> of<00:03:33.390> have<00:03:33.570> a<00:03:33.600> connection<00:03:34.050> to<00:03:34.200> the

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
will kind of have a connection to the

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.800 
will kind of have a connection to the
weapon<00:03:34.650> that<00:03:34.680> you<00:03:34.860> are<00:03:34.950> using<00:03:35.160> and<00:03:35.520> it<00:03:36.180> just

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
weapon that you are using and it just

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.600 
weapon that you are using and it just
overall<00:03:37.200> it<00:03:37.380> would<00:03:37.500> be<00:03:37.590> really<00:03:37.830> awesome<00:03:38.130> and

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
overall it would be really awesome and

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.880 
overall it would be really awesome and
the<00:03:39.240> other<00:03:39.510> thing<00:03:39.600> is<00:03:39.900> they<00:03:40.050> are<00:03:40.080> from<00:03:40.680> what<00:03:40.860> I

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
the other thing is they are from what I

the other thing is they are from what I
have<00:03:41.070> heard<00:03:41.100> and<00:03:41.610> I<00:03:41.700> hope<00:03:41.910> this<00:03:42.120> is<00:03:42.270> true<00:03:42.300> that

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
have heard and I hope this is true that

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.930 
have heard and I hope this is true that
you<00:03:43.410> will<00:03:43.530> be<00:03:43.560> able<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.950> customize<00:03:44.670> your

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
you will be able to customize your

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.630 
you will be able to customize your
character<00:03:45.000> a<00:03:45.570> really<00:03:46.260> good<00:03:46.500> bit<00:03:46.770> like<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.520> the

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
character a really good bit like to the

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.100 
character a really good bit like to the
point<00:03:47.880> where<00:03:48.000> you<00:03:48.060> can<00:03:48.240> maybe<00:03:48.390> change<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.810> Hat

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
point where you can maybe change the Hat

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.530 
point where you can maybe change the Hat
the<00:03:49.410> vest<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:50.220> camo<00:03:50.670> stuff<00:03:50.970> like<00:03:51.150> that<00:03:51.180> and

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
the vest the camo stuff like that and

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.150 
the vest the camo stuff like that and
they<00:03:52.050> already<00:03:52.200> had<00:03:52.410> the<00:03:52.530> ability<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:52.980> change

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
they already had the ability to change

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.310 
they already had the ability to change
your<00:03:53.340> camo<00:03:53.580> which<00:03:53.880> was<00:03:54.060> kind<00:03:54.870> of<00:03:54.930> advanced

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
your camo which was kind of advanced

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.570 
your camo which was kind of advanced
compared<00:03:55.740> to<00:03:55.830> a<00:03:55.860> lot<00:03:55.980> of<00:03:56.040> other<00:03:56.250> games<00:03:56.490> you

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
compared to a lot of other games you

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.160 
compared to a lot of other games you
weren't<00:03:56.820> able<00:03:56.910> to<00:03:57.060> add<00:03:57.270> a<00:03:57.300> special<00:03:57.570> camo<00:03:57.959> to

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
weren't able to add a special camo to

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.470 
weren't able to add a special camo to
your<00:03:58.320> character<00:03:58.770> so<00:03:59.310> I<00:03:59.340> think<00:03:59.520> the<00:03:59.970> ability<00:04:00.330> to

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
your character so I think the ability to

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.970 
your character so I think the ability to
do<00:04:00.660> that<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.140> then<00:04:01.230> including<00:04:01.709> all<00:04:01.830> that

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
do that and then including all that

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.670 
do that and then including all that
extra<00:04:02.310> stuff<00:04:02.340> is<00:04:02.730> going<00:04:03.000> to<00:04:03.120> add<00:04:03.300> a<00:04:03.570> new<00:04:03.930> thing

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
extra stuff is going to add a new thing

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.140 
extra stuff is going to add a new thing
to<00:04:04.920> battlefield<00:04:05.430> that<00:04:05.550> I<00:04:05.610> think<00:04:05.820> is<00:04:05.880> going<00:04:06.090> to

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
to battlefield that I think is going to

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.420

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
coming a battlefield people are probably

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.479

going<00:04:19.200> to<00:04:19.380> do<00:04:19.530> it<00:04:19.680> but<00:04:20.040> I<00:04:20.100> don't<00:04:20.220> see<00:04:20.459> it

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
going to do it but I don't see it

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.920 
going to do it but I don't see it
happening<00:04:20.640> as<00:04:20.970> much<00:04:21.239> because<00:04:21.480> I<00:04:21.600> feel<00:04:21.900> like

they're going to be it will kind of be

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.120 
they're going to be it will kind of be
embarrassing<00:04:25.050> to<00:04:25.080> be<00:04:25.350> honest<00:04:25.620> when<00:04:25.800> you<00:04:25.890> get

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130

as I used to but whenever I do I usually

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.379 
as I used to but whenever I do I usually
just<00:05:10.710> go<00:05:10.979> on<00:05:11.159> there<00:05:11.340> and<00:05:11.430> create<00:05:11.669> a<00:05:11.789> gun<00:05:11.970> use<00:05:12.270> it

just go on there and create a gun use it

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:14.059 
just go on there and create a gun use it
for<00:05:12.539> a<00:05:12.599> little<00:05:12.720> bit<00:05:12.840> and<00:05:13.139> because<00:05:13.710> whenever

for a little bit and because whenever

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:16.339 
for a little bit and because whenever
you<00:05:14.280> create<00:05:14.460> a<00:05:14.669> gun<00:05:14.879> the<00:05:15.360> likelihood<00:05:16.319> of

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.349 
you create a gun the likelihood of

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:18.589 
you create a gun the likelihood of
somebody<00:05:16.860> else<00:05:17.069> in<00:05:17.280> the<00:05:17.430> game<00:05:17.580> is<00:05:17.819> having<00:05:18.509> the

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:18.599 
somebody else in the game is having the

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:21.020 
somebody else in the game is having the

exact same gun set up camo everything as

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.170 
exact same gun set up camo everything as
you<00:05:21.210> is<00:05:21.409> very<00:05:22.409> unlikely<00:05:23.190> so<00:05:23.669> that's<00:05:24.000> what<00:05:24.150> I

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
you is very unlikely so that's what I

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.249 
you is very unlikely so that's what I
think<00:05:24.389> is<00:05:24.449> going<00:05:24.629> to<00:05:24.690> be<00:05:24.750> awesome<00:05:24.960> in

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
think is going to be awesome in

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:26.719 
think is going to be awesome in
battlefield<00:05:25.620> 4<00:05:25.650> you're<00:05:26.250> going<00:05:26.460> to<00:05:26.520> have<00:05:26.610> that

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
battlefield 4 you're going to have that

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:28.610 
battlefield 4 you're going to have that
original<00:05:27.300> gun<00:05:27.509> it's<00:05:27.750> gonna<00:05:27.870> have<00:05:28.050> attachments

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
original gun it's gonna have attachments

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.990 
original gun it's gonna have attachments
that<00:05:28.650> you<00:05:28.770> like<00:05:29.099> to<00:05:29.129> use<00:05:29.310> its<00:05:29.669> gonna<00:05:29.819> have<00:05:29.940> a

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
that you like to use its gonna have a

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.089 
that you like to use its gonna have a
camel<00:05:30.360> that<00:05:30.389> you<00:05:30.629> prefer<00:05:30.990> and<00:05:31.229> it's<00:05:31.680> going<00:05:31.860> to

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
camel that you prefer and it's going to

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:34.040 
camel that you prefer and it's going to
have<00:05:32.340> an<00:05:32.639> implement<00:05:33.360> you<00:05:33.449> created<00:05:33.900> yourself

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
have an implement you created yourself

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.360 
have an implement you created yourself
and<00:05:34.560> I<00:05:34.620> think<00:05:34.800> that's<00:05:34.949> going<00:05:35.099> to<00:05:35.219> add<00:05:35.340> some

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
and I think that's going to add some

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.180 
and I think that's going to add some
awesome<00:05:36.000> connection<00:05:36.629> to<00:05:36.750> your<00:05:36.870> gun<00:05:37.139> and<00:05:37.379> it's

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
awesome connection to your gun and it's

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.709 
awesome connection to your gun and it's
kind<00:05:38.610> of<00:05:38.669> be<00:05:38.759> like<00:05:38.879> oh<00:05:39.030> yeah<00:05:39.210> look<00:05:39.330> at<00:05:39.419> this<00:05:39.539> gun

more<00:05:52.860> camels<00:05:53.219> for<00:05:53.310> it<00:05:53.550> so<00:05:53.909> let's<00:05:54.090> say<00:05:54.240> I<00:05:54.270> use

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:54.569 
more camels for it so let's say I use

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:56.240 
more camels for it so let's say I use
the<00:05:54.719> gun<00:05:54.870> a<00:05:54.900> lot<00:05:55.139> I'll<00:05:55.380> have<00:05:55.590> a<00:05:55.620> camo<00:05:55.949> that<00:05:56.219> a

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
the gun a lot I'll have a camo that a

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.769 
the gun a lot I'll have a camo that a
guy<00:05:56.460> who<00:05:56.520> doesn't<00:05:56.789> use<00:05:56.940> the<00:05:57.029> gun<00:05:57.240> at<00:05:57.360> all<00:05:57.509> has

00:05:57.769 --> 00:05:57.779 
guy who doesn't use the gun at all has

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:59.420 
guy who doesn't use the gun at all has
so<00:05:58.469> that's<00:05:58.740> gonna<00:05:58.860> be<00:05:59.009> something<00:05:59.279> really

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
so that's gonna be something really

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.700 
so that's gonna be something really
awesome<00:05:59.870> another<00:06:00.870> really<00:06:01.050> interesting<00:06:01.169> thing

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
awesome another really interesting thing

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.559 
awesome another really interesting thing
about<00:06:01.740> the<00:06:02.069> customization<00:06:02.759> is<00:06:02.909> the<00:06:03.389> ability

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:03.569 
about the customization is the ability

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:05.330 
about the customization is the ability
to<00:06:03.900> customize<00:06:04.380> your<00:06:04.529> knife<00:06:04.740> you<00:06:04.979> can<00:06:05.099> use<00:06:05.190> the

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
to customize your knife you can use the

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.610 
to customize your knife you can use the
shank<00:06:05.639> and<00:06:05.849> a<00:06:06.300> bayonet<00:06:06.840> at<00:06:06.990> this<00:06:07.169> point<00:06:07.440> they

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
shank and a bayonet at this point they

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.230 
shank and a bayonet at this point they
are<00:06:07.650> going<00:06:07.889> to<00:06:08.009> add<00:06:08.130> more<00:06:08.310> knives<00:06:08.550> I'm<00:06:08.789> sure<00:06:09.029> of

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
are going to add more knives I'm sure of

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.610 
are going to add more knives I'm sure of
it<00:06:09.360> but<00:06:09.810> those<00:06:09.930> are<00:06:10.050> some<00:06:10.229> really<00:06:10.349> cool

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
it but those are some really cool

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.040 
it but those are some really cool
options<00:06:11.039> that<00:06:11.159> we<00:06:11.250> have<00:06:11.370> seen<00:06:11.550> so<00:06:11.729> far<00:06:11.969> I<00:06:12.240> think

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
options that we have seen so far I think

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.999 
options that we have seen so far I think
they're<00:06:13.169> going<00:06:13.349> to<00:06:13.440> have<00:06:13.620> separate

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:14.009 
they're going to have separate

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:16.159 
they're going to have separate
animations<00:06:14.759> just<00:06:15.060> like<00:06:15.210> the<00:06:15.300> ACV<00:06:15.599> 90<00:06:15.990> had<00:06:16.139> a

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:16.169 
animations just like the ACV 90 had a

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:18.170 
animations just like the ACV 90 had a
diff<00:06:16.440> some<00:06:16.800> different<00:06:17.190> takedown<00:06:17.610> animations

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
diff some different takedown animations

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.149 
diff some different takedown animations
than<00:06:18.330> the<00:06:18.419> original<00:06:18.840> knife<00:06:18.990> did<00:06:19.259> and<00:06:19.469> I<00:06:19.919> think

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:20.159
