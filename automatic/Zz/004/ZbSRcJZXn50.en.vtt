00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
would you have for Justin I think I'm a

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.660 
would you have for Justin I think I'm a
daily<00:05:33.540> basis<00:05:33.990> gonna<00:05:34.290> be<00:05:34.440> compared<00:05:35.340> for<00:05:35.640> a

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:35.670 
daily basis gonna be compared for a

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.990 
daily basis gonna be compared for a
little<00:05:36.480> bit<00:05:36.630> higher<00:05:36.870> intensity<00:05:37.440> you<00:05:38.000> know

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
little bit higher intensity you know

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.970 
little bit higher intensity you know
forever<00:05:39.270> when<00:05:39.510> we<00:05:39.690> were<00:05:39.840> to<00:05:40.020> achieve<00:05:40.560> a<00:05:40.770> higher

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:40.980 
forever when we were to achieve a higher

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.790 
forever when we were to achieve a higher
intention<00:05:41.490> I<00:05:41.940> think<00:05:42.840> at<00:05:42.960> this<00:05:43.110> point<00:05:43.170> it's

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
intention I think at this point it's

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.400 
intention I think at this point it's
going<00:05:44.010> to<00:05:44.100> be<00:05:44.450> baptized<00:05:45.450> of<00:05:45.600> intensity<00:05:46.080> daily

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
going to be baptized of intensity daily

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.670 
going to be baptized of intensity daily
and<00:05:46.950> every<00:05:47.220> day<00:05:47.750> you<00:05:48.750> have<00:05:48.780> achieved<00:05:49.380> a<00:05:49.470> little

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
and every day you have achieved a little

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.460 
and every day you have achieved a little
bit<00:05:49.800> more<00:05:49.980> yes<00:05:50.310> your<00:05:50.460> body<00:05:51.050> is<00:05:52.050> it<00:05:52.230> like<00:05:52.350> an

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
bit more yes your body is it like an
