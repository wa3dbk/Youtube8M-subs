00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.450 
impression then we're going to take our
mat<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.149> just<00:00:52.050> set<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.800> over<00:00:52.890> turn<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.280> over

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
onto the modeling chocolate in this case

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.709 
onto the modeling chocolate in this case
and<00:00:57.800> use<00:00:58.800> some<00:00:59.100> pretty<00:00:59.879> good<00:01:00.090> pressure<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.690> you

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
and use some pretty good pressure so you

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.319 
and use some pretty good pressure so you
can<00:01:00.930> get<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> nice<00:01:01.350> clean<00:01:01.910> impression<00:01:02.910> as<00:01:03.059> you

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
can get a nice clean impression as you

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.890 
can get a nice clean impression as you
roll<00:01:03.600> over<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.920> top<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.900> modeling

spray into the darker areas of the of
the<00:01:30.049> texture<00:01:31.049> here<00:01:31.909> it<00:01:32.909> doesn't<00:01:33.150> matter<00:01:33.450> if

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
the texture here it doesn't matter if

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.300 
the texture here it doesn't matter if
you<00:01:33.840> hit<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.500> little<00:01:34.650> bit<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.070> lighter

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
you hit a little bit of the lighter

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.429 
you hit a little bit of the lighter
whatever<00:01:35.880> -<00:01:36.119> but<00:01:36.329> what<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.900> want<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.170> do<00:01:37.290> is

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
whatever - but what you want to do is

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
get some shadow in the dark areas again

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.850 
get some shadow in the dark areas again
this<00:01:40.860> would<00:01:41.100> depend<00:01:41.610> on<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.850> kind<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.860> bark

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
this would depend on the kind of of bark

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.219 
this would depend on the kind of of bark
texture<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.729> want<00:01:44.970> as<00:01:45.119> far<00:01:45.270> as<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.570> color<00:01:45.899> and

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
texture you want as far as the color and

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.920 
texture you want as far as the color and
so<00:01:46.409> forth<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.670> could<00:01:47.880> be<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.750> just

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
so forth so so it could be this is just

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.889 
so forth so so it could be this is just
one<00:01:49.140> possibility<00:01:50.270> then<00:01:51.270> I'm<00:01:51.540> going<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.750> go

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
one possibility then I'm going to go

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.050 
one possibility then I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.229> use<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.439> moist<00:01:52.920> paper<00:01:53.310> towel<00:01:53.759> and

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
ahead and use a moist paper towel and

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.580 
ahead and use a moist paper towel and
just<00:01:54.119> blot<00:01:54.840> off<00:01:55.640> some<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:57.020> color<00:01:58.020> off<00:01:58.290> of

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
just blot off some of the color off of

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.850 
just blot off some of the color off of
the<00:01:58.710> surface<00:02:01.310> now<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.369> don't<00:02:02.549> want<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.799> see<00:02:04.799> how

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
the surface now I don't want to see how

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.850 
the surface now I don't want to see how
that's<00:02:05.070> coming<00:02:05.219> off<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.729> little<00:02:06.509> more<00:02:06.860> moisture

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
that's coming off a little more moisture

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.050 
that's coming off a little more moisture
on<00:02:08.009> here<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.550> more<00:02:08.700> water<00:02:09.030> okay

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
on here and more water okay

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.000 
on here and more water okay
we're<00:02:10.270> going<00:02:10.390> to<00:02:10.450> simply<00:02:11.380> get<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.620> little<00:02:11.860> bit

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
we're going to simply get a little bit

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:19.080 
we're going to simply get a little bit
more<00:02:12.280> of<00:02:12.400> this<00:02:12.550> off<00:02:15.990> and<00:02:17.760> again<00:02:18.760> something

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
more of this off and again something

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.050 
more of this off and again something
like<00:02:19.270> this<00:02:20.459> could<00:02:21.459> be<00:02:21.610> used<00:02:21.790> for<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:22.590> washed<00:02:23.590> out

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
like this could be used for a washed out

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.080 
like this could be used for a washed out
piece<00:02:25.060> of<00:02:25.240> bark<00:02:26.520> then<00:02:27.520> I'm<00:02:27.640> going<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:27.850> go<00:02:27.970> ahead

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
piece of bark then I'm going to go ahead

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.290 
piece of bark then I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:28.620> spray<00:02:29.620> with<00:02:29.800> some<00:02:29.830> brown<00:02:30.280> color<00:02:30.670> it's

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
and spray with some brown color it's

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.090 
and spray with some brown color it's
basically<00:02:31.900> kind<00:02:32.170> of<00:02:32.290> go<00:02:32.410> over<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:32.920> whole

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
basically kind of go over the whole

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.479 
basically kind of go over the whole
thing<00:02:33.130> because<00:02:33.910> this<00:02:34.480> way<00:02:34.720> it'll<00:02:34.930> kind<00:02:35.260> of

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
thing because this way it'll kind of

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.210 
thing because this way it'll kind of
accent<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:37.110> black<00:02:38.110> color<00:02:38.440> that<00:02:38.709> we<00:02:38.830> put<00:02:39.100> in

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
accent the black color that we put in

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:46.320 
accent the black color that we put in
before<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:43.019> it'll<00:02:44.280> look<00:02:45.280> brighter<00:02:45.670> on<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:45.970> on

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
before and it'll look brighter on the on

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.690 
before and it'll look brighter on the on
the<00:02:46.630> highlights<00:02:47.080> where<00:02:47.890> it's<00:02:48.040> light<00:02:48.310> or<00:02:48.519> so

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
the highlights where it's light or so

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.610 
the highlights where it's light or so
and<00:02:49.000> it<00:02:49.300> could<00:02:49.450> be<00:02:49.570> left<00:02:49.780> just<00:02:50.080> like<00:02:50.140> you<00:02:50.500> have

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
and it could be left just like you have

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.620 
and it could be left just like you have
a<00:02:50.650> pretty<00:02:50.890> nice-looking<00:02:51.100> facsimile<00:02:51.760> of<00:02:52.090> bark

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.630 

but<00:02:55.630> I'm<00:02:55.780> going<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:55.989> go<00:02:56.140> ahead<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.650> I'm<00:02:57.610> going

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
but I'm going to go ahead and I'm going

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.520 
but I'm going to go ahead and I'm going
to<00:02:57.819> block<00:02:58.120> this<00:02:58.360> a<00:02:58.630> little<00:02:58.959> bit<00:02:59.080> more<00:02:59.319> and

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
to block this a little bit more and

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.830 
to block this a little bit more and
that'll<00:02:59.800> that'll<00:03:00.190> make<00:03:00.580> some<00:03:00.850> additional

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
that'll that'll make some additional

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.970 
that'll that'll make some additional
highlights<00:03:02.140> stand<00:03:03.040> out<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:03.700> that<00:03:04.350> can<00:03:05.350> even

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
highlights stand out and that can even

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:21.940 
highlights stand out and that can even
give<00:03:06.310> you<00:03:06.430> a<00:03:06.459> more<00:03:07.680> realistic<00:03:09.959> appearance

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.010
