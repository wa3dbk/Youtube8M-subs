00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.450 

it's<00:01:48.910> pretty<00:01:49.150> fun

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.490 

do<00:01:55.700> a<00:01:55.730> lot<00:01:55.970> of<00:01:56.030> black<00:01:56.300> smoke<00:01:56.510> when<00:01:56.900> you<00:01:56.990> step<00:01:57.290> on

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
it

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.180 
it
hasn't<00:01:58.540> been<00:01:58.600> tuned<00:01:58.930> so<00:01:59.320> that<00:01:59.530> means<00:01:59.740> gas<00:02:00.070> just

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:15.449 

third<00:02:03.460> gear<00:02:03.820> in<00:02:04.150> our<00:02:04.480> here

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.179 

oh<00:02:15.489> and<00:02:16.390> also<00:02:16.599> it<00:02:17.019> does<00:02:17.260> have<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.650> six<00:02:17.920> speed

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:18.189 
oh and also it does have the six speed

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:19.880 
oh and also it does have the six speed
toilet<00:02:19.150> eleven

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
toilet eleven

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.570 
toilet eleven
VZ<00:02:20.280> r<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.730> n

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
VZ r and n

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.330 
VZ r and n
so<00:02:21.700> it's<00:02:21.850> a<00:02:21.940> six-speed<00:02:22.450> with<00:02:22.720> LSD<00:02:23.340> that

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
so it's a six-speed with LSD that

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.500 
so it's a six-speed with LSD that
definitely<00:02:24.880> helps<00:02:25.270> out<00:02:25.420> with

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
what else is there suspension technique

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:58.460 
what else is there suspension technique
Springs<00:02:53.390> bog<00:02:55.400> struts<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:57.270> like<00:02:57.930> I<00:02:58.080> said<00:02:58.140> it

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
Springs bog struts and like I said it

from a celica GT s what else is or oh
you<00:03:09.810> got<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.110> apex<00:03:11.390> super<00:03:12.390> AFC<00:03:12.930> AR<00:03:13.620> see

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
you got the apex super AFC AR see

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.720 
you got the apex super AFC AR see
whether<00:03:14.160> we<00:03:14.400> call<00:03:15.020> this<00:03:16.020> thing

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
whether we call this thing

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.910 

and<00:03:32.430> we'll<00:03:33.120> probably<00:03:33.360> not<00:03:33.660> find<00:03:33.989> another<00:03:34.500> car

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
and we'll probably not find another car

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.350 
and we'll probably not find another car
out<00:03:34.950> here<00:03:35.370> like<00:03:35.610> I<00:03:35.760> said<00:03:35.940> it's<00:03:36.120> a<00:03:36.270> Geo<00:03:36.599> Prizm<00:03:36.980> so

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
out here like I said it's a Geo Prizm so

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.750 
out here like I said it's a Geo Prizm so
it's<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:39.960> same<00:03:40.290> thing<00:03:40.650> as<00:03:40.770> a<00:03:40.800> Toyota<00:03:41.220> Corolla

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:26.820 

that's

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.059 

about<00:05:27.159> a<00:05:27.190> six<00:05:27.789> years<00:05:28.150> Sam<00:05:28.539> Parker's<00:05:29.319> and<00:05:29.500> 16

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:30.069 
about a six years Sam Parker's and 16

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:33.020 
about a six years Sam Parker's and 16
are<00:05:30.879> the<00:05:31.090> sixth<00:05:31.419> year<00:05:31.569> right<00:05:31.780> now

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
are the sixth year right now

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.530 
are the sixth year right now
I'm<00:05:33.360> just<00:05:33.690> like<00:05:34.080> on<00:05:34.320> the<00:05:34.410> hill

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
I'm just like on the hill

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.820 
I'm just like on the hill
I'm<00:05:36.660> really<00:05:36.870> lag<00:05:37.440> issues

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.820 

but<00:05:42.830> is<00:05:42.950> around<00:05:43.370> ten<00:05:43.820> or<00:05:44.180> so<00:05:44.870> death<00:05:45.200> I<00:05:45.380> think

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
but is around ten or so death I think

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.070 
but is around ten or so death I think
actually<00:05:46.580> it's<00:05:46.820> less

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.189 

yeah<00:05:50.620> it's<00:05:50.770> less<00:05:51.009> because<00:05:51.340> I<00:05:51.810> forgot<00:05:52.810> I<00:05:52.870> got

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 
yeah it's less because I forgot I got

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:56.369 
yeah it's less because I forgot I got
the<00:05:53.379> actual<00:05:53.590> psi1<00:05:54.430> not<00:05:54.610> the<00:05:54.759> bars<00:05:55.030> one<00:05:55.379> so

00:05:56.369 --> 00:05:56.379 
the actual psi1 not the bars one so

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:57.600 
the actual psi1 not the bars one so
instead<00:05:56.710> of<00:05:56.770> being

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
instead of being

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.869 
instead of being
come<00:05:57.969> on

00:05:59.869 --> 00:05:59.879 
come on

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:06.050 
come on
which<00:06:00.449> is<00:06:00.599> 14<00:06:01.349> psi

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.390 

so<00:06:06.569> it's<00:06:06.719> a<00:06:06.780> little<00:06:06.960> less<00:06:07.199> than<00:06:07.500> that<00:06:08.009> I'll

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
so it's a little less than that I'll

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.140 
so it's a little less than that I'll
step<00:06:08.849> on<00:06:09.000> a

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.820
