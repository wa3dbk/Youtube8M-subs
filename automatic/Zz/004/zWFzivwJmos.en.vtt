know I'm going to think it's worth it I
think<00:02:40.110> it<00:02:40.230> should<00:02:40.470> always<00:02:41.420> wear<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:42.600> can

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
think it's definitely worth it

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.240

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
it's not heavy I mean the coverage of it

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.790 
it's not heavy I mean the coverage of it
is<00:02:55.800> nice<00:02:56.450> but<00:02:57.450> if<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:57.990> don't<00:02:58.290> want<00:02:58.500> too<00:02:58.650> much

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
is nice but if you don't want too much

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.130 
is nice but if you don't want too much
coverage<00:02:59.250> from<00:02:59.370> it<00:02:59.580> it's<00:03:00.240> not<00:03:00.450> like<00:03:00.660> you<00:03:00.870> pump

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
coverage from it it's not like you pump

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.690 
coverage from it it's not like you pump
a<00:03:01.260> little<00:03:01.380> bit<00:03:01.530> out<00:03:01.800> and<00:03:01.830> you're<00:03:02.220> kind<00:03:02.610> of

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
a little bit out and you're kind of

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.550 
a little bit out and you're kind of
stuck<00:03:03.030> with<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:03.540> know<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:03.720> can<00:03:04.110> build<00:03:04.410> it

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
stuck with it you know you can build it

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.110 
stuck with it you know you can build it
up<00:03:04.650> that's<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:04.980> nice<00:03:05.250> aspect<00:03:05.760> of<00:03:05.970> this

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
up that's a nice aspect of this

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.090 
up that's a nice aspect of this
foundation<00:03:06.330> which<00:03:06.720> I<00:03:06.810> don't<00:03:06.870> think<00:03:07.100> would

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
foundation which I don't think would

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.650 
foundation which I don't think would
necessarily<00:03:08.310> be<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:09.000> case<00:03:09.240> I<00:03:09.420> thought

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
necessarily be the case I thought

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.210 
necessarily be the case I thought
perhaps<00:03:09.840> this<00:03:10.140> foundation<00:03:10.590> is<00:03:10.680> quite<00:03:10.980> full

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
perhaps this foundation is quite full

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.270 
perhaps this foundation is quite full
coverage<00:03:12.110> actually<00:03:13.110> it's<00:03:13.350> kind<00:03:13.739> of<00:03:13.860> really

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
coverage actually it's kind of really

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.979 
coverage actually it's kind of really
moisturizing<00:03:15.000> really<00:03:15.239> quite<00:03:15.480> light<00:03:15.750> so

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
moisturizing really quite light so

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.290 
moisturizing really quite light so
that's<00:03:16.170> one<00:03:16.470> than<00:03:16.680> pump<00:03:16.970> and<00:03:17.970> as<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.150> can<00:03:18.239> see

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
that's one than pump and as you can see

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.000 
that's one than pump and as you can see
when<00:03:18.870> you<00:03:18.959> spread<00:03:19.170> out<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.350> comment<00:03:19.739> on<00:03:19.860> your

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.310 
when you spread out the comment on your
face<00:03:20.190> it<00:03:20.400> really<00:03:20.660> does<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:21.690> little<00:03:22.050> bit<00:03:22.140> goes<00:03:22.290> a

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
face it really does a little bit goes a

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.380 
face it really does a little bit goes a
long<00:03:22.560> way<00:03:22.800> so<00:03:23.040> that's<00:03:23.670> one<00:03:23.880> little<00:03:23.940> pump<00:03:24.269> I

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
think with this foundation you

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.949 
think with this foundation you
definitely<00:03:26.610> just<00:03:26.790> get<00:03:26.940> away<00:03:27.150> with<00:03:27.300> kind<00:03:27.750> of

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
moisturizer because the coverage of it

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.650 
moisturizer because the coverage of it
for<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.769> first<00:03:32.070> kind<00:03:32.370> of<00:03:32.489> though<00:03:32.730> is<00:03:33.300> like<00:03:33.600> a

it's<00:03:48.360> given<00:03:48.600> some<00:03:48.750> color<00:03:48.989> it's<00:03:49.500> not<00:03:49.650> going<00:03:49.890> to

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
it's given some color it's not going to

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.680 
it's given some color it's not going to
much<00:03:50.280> color<00:03:50.580> it's<00:03:50.700> not<00:03:50.820> people<00:03:50.940> won't<00:03:51.330> Terra

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
much color it's not people won't Terra

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.900 
much color it's not people won't Terra
color<00:03:51.989> it's<00:03:52.230> gonna<00:03:52.350> nice<00:03:52.650> kind<00:03:52.950> of<00:03:53.070> color<00:03:53.760> to

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
color it's gonna nice kind of color to

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.840 
color it's gonna nice kind of color to
my<00:03:54.000> face<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.630> is<00:03:54.870> quite<00:03:55.260> a<00:03:55.500> light<00:03:56.220> reflective

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
my face it is quite a light reflective

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.310 
my face it is quite a light reflective
but<00:03:57.060> not<00:03:57.180> in<00:03:57.239> a<00:03:57.299> sparkly<00:03:57.780> way<00:03:57.930> I<00:03:57.959> think<00:03:58.230> it's

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
but not in a sparkly way I think it's

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.660 
but not in a sparkly way I think it's
like<00:03:58.440> letting<00:03:58.860> it<00:03:58.950> kind<00:03:59.100> of<00:03:59.130> a<00:03:59.190> Julie<00:03:59.519> way

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
like letting it kind of a Julie way

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.090 
like letting it kind of a Julie way
which<00:03:59.850> is<00:03:59.970> very<00:04:00.030> very<00:04:00.330> nice<00:04:00.570> um<00:04:01.049> but<00:04:01.799> I<00:04:01.830> mean<00:04:01.980> as

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
which is very very nice um but I mean as

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.500 
which is very very nice um but I mean as
you<00:04:02.190> can<00:04:02.250> see<00:04:02.459> it's<00:04:02.580> not<00:04:02.700> hugely<00:04:03.150> full

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
you can see it's not hugely full

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.539 
you can see it's not hugely full
coverage<00:04:03.870> or<00:04:04.140> medium<00:04:04.620> coverage<00:04:04.980> to<00:04:05.190> deal<00:04:05.400> with

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
coverage or medium coverage to deal with

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.259 
coverage or medium coverage to deal with
so<00:04:06.650> this<00:04:07.650> is<00:04:07.769> very<00:04:07.920> enough<00:04:08.370> um<00:04:08.549> you<00:04:09.060> don't<00:04:09.150> have

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
so this is very enough um you don't have

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.780 
so this is very enough um you don't have
to<00:04:09.510> I'm<00:04:10.470> using<00:04:10.680> tiny<00:04:11.010> enough<00:04:11.250> limits

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
to I'm using tiny enough limits

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.920 
to I'm using tiny enough limits
before<00:04:12.150> pub<00:04:12.360> you<00:04:12.840> don't<00:04:12.989> have<00:04:13.140> to<00:04:13.319> but<00:04:13.530> I<00:04:14.930> just

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
before pub you don't have to but I just

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:22.640 
before pub you don't have to but I just
prefer<00:04:16.259> to<00:04:20.630> pushing<00:04:21.630> it<00:04:21.720> in<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:22.139> second<00:04:22.470> layer

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
prefer to pushing it in the second layer

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.150 
prefer to pushing it in the second layer
and<00:04:23.630> as<00:04:24.630> you<00:04:24.720> can<00:04:24.870> see<00:04:25.110> already<00:04:25.410> from<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:25.979> side

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
and as you can see already from the side

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.070 
and as you can see already from the side
of<00:04:26.250> my<00:04:26.310> face<00:04:26.520> it's<00:04:26.820> kind<00:04:27.090> of<00:04:27.210> starting<00:04:27.780> to<00:04:27.810> come

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
of my face it's kind of starting to come

of my face it's kind of starting to come
a<00:04:28.110> little<00:04:28.350> bit<00:04:28.590> fuller<00:04:28.889> coverage<00:04:31.669> okay<00:04:32.669> so

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
a little bit fuller coverage okay so

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.670 
a little bit fuller coverage okay so
