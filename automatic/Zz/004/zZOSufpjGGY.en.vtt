right<00:01:32.430> off<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.850> plan<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.450> then<00:01:33.869> down

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
right off of the plan and then down

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.280 
right off of the plan and then down
below<00:01:34.110> we<00:01:34.890> planted<00:01:35.430> about<00:01:35.790> 30<00:01:36.509> olive<00:01:36.990> trees

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290

below we planted about 30 olive trees
and<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:38.070> will<00:01:38.250> be<00:01:38.400> pressing<00:01:38.909> relatively<00:01:39.840> small

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
and so will be pressing relatively small

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.840 
and so will be pressing relatively small
volumes<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.710> oil<00:01:40.890> down<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.280> road<00:01:41.430> but<00:01:41.579> should

volumes of oil down the road but should

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.030 
volumes of oil down the road but should
be<00:01:41.880> quite<00:01:42.270> sufficient<00:01:42.479> for<00:01:42.960> us<00:01:42.990> out<00:01:43.649> on<00:01:43.920> the

environment and self-sufficient
environment<00:01:58.439> as<00:01:58.560> possible<00:01:59.130> it's<00:01:59.430> not<00:01:59.579> really

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
environment as possible it's not really

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.510 
environment as possible it's not really
possible<00:02:00.259> in<00:02:01.259> our<00:02:01.469> world<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.979> can't<00:02:02.340> really

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
possible in our world I can't really

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.539 
possible in our world I can't really
like<00:02:03.090> grow<00:02:03.659> wheat<00:02:03.899> here<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.590> quantity<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.490> I

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
like grow wheat here in a quantity and I

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.160 
like grow wheat here in a quantity and I
can't<00:02:05.790> really<00:02:06.000> raise<00:02:06.299> cattle<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.869> guess<00:02:07.049> I

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
can't really raise cattle I guess I

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.199 
can't really raise cattle I guess I
could<00:02:07.350> one<00:02:07.590> all<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:08.190> type<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.429> thing<00:02:08.759> can

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
could one all that type of thing can

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.940 
could one all that type of thing can
come<00:02:09.450> from<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.720> small<00:02:09.959> community<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.709> really

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
come from a small community and I really

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.930 
come from a small community and I really
think<00:02:11.069> that's<00:02:11.310> where<00:02:11.489> we're<00:02:11.640> going<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.819> be

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
think that's where we're going to be

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.410 
think that's where we're going to be
headed<00:02:12.180> back

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
headed back

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.809 
headed back
into<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.810> much<00:02:13.530> more<00:02:13.709> local<00:02:14.069> watersheds<00:02:14.640> and

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
into a much more local watersheds and

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.390 
into a much more local watersheds and
food<00:02:15.060> sheds
