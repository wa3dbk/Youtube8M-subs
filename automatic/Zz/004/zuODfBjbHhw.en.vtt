00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.470 
just a little teeny
usually<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:50.980> three<00:00:51.250> doilies<00:00:51.730> put<00:00:52.600> on<00:00:52.720> there

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
usually the three doilies put on there

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.270 
usually the three doilies put on there
and<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.110> if<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.260> haven't<00:00:55.620> used<00:00:55.710> are<00:00:55.860> robots

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
and so if you haven't used are robots

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.460 
and so if you haven't used are robots
before<00:00:56.520> we<00:00:57.480> actually<00:00:57.660> still<00:00:58.110> spin<00:00:58.350> them

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
before we actually still spin them

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.680 
before we actually still spin them
ourselves<00:00:58.860> they<00:00:59.400> go<00:00:59.550> on<00:00:59.579> really<00:00:59.910> easily<00:01:00.030> so

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
ourselves they go on really easily so

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.360 
ourselves they go on really easily so
there's<00:01:01.379> already<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.620> little<00:01:01.770> he<00:01:01.980> civ<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
there's already a little he civ on the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.890 
there's already a little he civ on the
back<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:02.790> once<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.059> put<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.270> on<00:01:03.450> there<00:01:03.720> it's

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
back so once you put it on there it's

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.080 
back so once you put it on there it's
going<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.199> start<00:01:04.440> stick<00:01:04.769> right<00:01:04.949> away<00:01:05.190> she<00:01:06.000> go

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
going to start stick right away she go

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.359 
going to start stick right away she go
ahead<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.600> put<00:01:06.780> your<00:01:06.810> first<00:01:07.170> rub<00:01:07.380> on<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:07.680> you

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
ahead and put your first rub on on you

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.950 
ahead and put your first rub on on you
can<00:01:08.550> use<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> robot<00:01:09.119> tool<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.540> just<00:01:09.780> use<00:01:09.930> my

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
can use a robot tool but I just use my

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.140 
can use a robot tool but I just use my
hands<00:01:10.470> it's<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.680> little<00:01:10.890> easier<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:12.030> go

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
hands it's a little easier and to go

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.820 
hands it's a little easier and to go
around<00:01:12.300> the<00:01:12.450> edges<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.960> just<00:01:13.140> kind<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.410> rub<00:01:13.680> on

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
around the edges you just kind of rub on

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.170 
around the edges you just kind of rub on
the<00:01:13.950> edge<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.340> can<00:01:14.490> see<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.790> just<00:01:14.850> kind<00:01:15.150> of

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
the edge and you can see it just kind of

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.260 
the edge and you can see it just kind of
flips<00:01:15.509> right<00:01:15.840> over<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.410> edge<00:01:16.440> there

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.749 

so<00:01:20.810> you<00:01:20.869> want<00:01:21.079> to<00:01:21.140> do<00:01:21.229> that<00:01:21.259> two<00:01:21.680> more<00:01:21.710> times<00:01:21.920> so

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
so you want to do that two more times so

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.450 
so you want to do that two more times so
you<00:01:23.329> have<00:01:23.539> a<00:01:23.570> nice<00:01:24.109> coverage<00:01:24.770> of<00:01:25.039> the<00:01:25.250> white

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
you have a nice coverage of the white

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.000 
you have a nice coverage of the white
rub<00:01:26.000> ons<00:01:26.179> on<00:01:26.420> there

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.590 

as<00:01:29.190> you<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.400> see<00:01:29.760> this<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> little<00:01:30.480> look

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
as you can see this is a little look

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.820 
as you can see this is a little look
like<00:01:30.750> when<00:01:30.900> she<00:01:31.050> kind<00:01:31.230> of<00:01:31.260> put<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.530> little

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
like when she kind of put a little

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.620 
like when she kind of put a little
random<00:01:32.220> selection<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.760> white<00:01:32.970> rub<00:01:33.210> ons<00:01:33.390> on

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
random selection of white rub ons on

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.870 
random selection of white rub ons on
there<00:01:33.870> and<00:01:34.770> then<00:01:34.980> we'll<00:01:35.130> go<00:01:35.280> ahead<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.610> add<00:01:35.850> a

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
there and then we'll go ahead and add a

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.460 
there and then we'll go ahead and add a
little<00:01:36.120> gold<00:01:36.450> one<00:01:36.660> than<00:01:36.840> there<00:01:37.140> because<00:01:37.290> it's

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
little gold one than there because it's

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.230 
little gold one than there because it's
kind<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.710> pretty

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
kind of pretty
