00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.020
 solarization solarization from the word solaris 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.420
 the sun for that live man 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.130
 held under the influence of the sun not yet 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.099
 she was born under the influence of the sun 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.430
 we emerged from thanks to the sun and 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.109
 solarization affects our whole 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.660
 the body is not only on our health 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.650
 eye I want to talk about one of 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.680
 ways to solarize 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.830
 or candle the most important thing is to be around 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.110
 it was dark 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:37.350
 it can be a night around the campfire fire 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.590
 tent it could be a candle house but 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:45.180
 The meaning of such solarization is 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.070
 next what you spend without closing 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.879
 eye 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:53.430
 hold head to one side in 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.100
 another pursuing without touching 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:02.070
 a fire or a candle just kind of gliding 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:04.260
 past one way and the other way what 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.510
 happens at this moment at this moment 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.950
 when you look into the darkness you have 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.820
 your sticks are included these are those neurons 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.210
 your retinal eyes which 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:21.380
 work in the dark when you drive 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.630
 lead your gaze past the fire 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.930
 react other others 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.479
 miron and our eyes are called cones 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.700
 and so they are activated and 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.150
 turn on and when you re- held 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.750
 look further again into the dark again he 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.960
 switched on a stick like that 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.820
 switching brackets on a stick with 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.549
 of view 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.670
 dark on sight color is very useful 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:54.060
 for eyes and here it is one of the three methods 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.369
 solarization which exists it 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.009
 method of incorporating rods and cones and 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.850
 rods and cones and he is done exactly 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:06.899
 candle or fire and it is in the dark 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.119
 other methods I have already told you either 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.129
 I will say it again solarization method 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.360
 directly by the sun at dawn and on 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:17.490
 sunset either target method 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.120
 lizization then when you close your eyes 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.130
 closed eyelids 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.410
 drive under your palms eyes 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:31.090
 three principal methods either you 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:33.040
 train only your cones or this 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.440
 then when you look at the sun either 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.780
 then when you train your eyes under 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.660
 closed eyelids closed hands 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.480
 train your wands either then 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.450
 when you train in the dark 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.940
 your eyes on the fire or on the candles then 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.520
 they train both and train 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.760
 cone switch mode 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.650
 on a stick these are three principal methods 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.500
 which you can always use 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.470
 they are absolutely harmless for well 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.600
 the exception of looking at the sun is 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.170
 separately you need to watch this video 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.810
 where I tell you how to look at the sun 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.150
 what is solarization because it 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.790
 it may be dangerous to look at the fire 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.130
 the candle is absolutely safe therefore I 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.930
 recommend this very good method 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.930
 which you can always use
