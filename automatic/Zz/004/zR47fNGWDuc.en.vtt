they<00:00:24.150> hooked<00:00:24.300> them<00:00:24.390> all<00:00:24.510> up<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.810> an<00:00:24.900> fMRI<00:00:25.320> and

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
they hooked them all up to an fMRI and

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.320 
they hooked them all up to an fMRI and
showed<00:00:25.920> them<00:00:26.099> pictures<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.789> potentially

dangerous or negative situations things

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.160 
dangerous or negative situations things
like<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.880> woman<00:00:30.210> being<00:00:30.330> mugged<00:00:30.689> at<00:00:30.929> knifepoint

and<00:00:31.590> then<00:00:31.890> they<00:00:31.949> were<00:00:32.009> told<00:00:32.219> not<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.399> worry

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
and then they were told not to worry

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.340 
and then they were told not to worry
because<00:00:33.000> every<00:00:33.570> picture<00:00:33.899> had<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> positive

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
because every picture had a positive

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.620 
because every picture had a positive
outcome<00:00:34.770> like<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.610> woman<00:00:35.880> escaping<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.600> the

outcome like the woman escaping and the
subjects<00:00:37.079> who<00:00:37.440> showed<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.739> more<00:00:38.100> negative

without a particular variant of it our
unfailingly<00:01:42.930> more<00:01:43.259> optimistic<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.100> yeah

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
unfailingly more optimistic so yeah

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.399 
unfailingly more optimistic so yeah
pessimism<00:01:44.939> could<00:01:45.270> be<00:01:45.450> genetic<00:01:45.840> but<00:01:45.990> why<00:01:46.320> are

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
pessimism could be genetic but why are

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.889 
pessimism could be genetic but why are
we<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.590> pessimistic<00:01:47.460> about<00:01:47.670> pessimism<00:01:48.600> sure

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
we so pessimistic about pessimism sure

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.960 
we so pessimistic about pessimism sure

optimism puts less stress on us causes

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.330 
optimism puts less stress on us causes

kept us alive early on as a species too
much<00:01:58.380> optimism<00:01:59.040> can<00:01:59.369> lead<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.790> recklessness<00:02:00.329> a

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659

2011<00:02:01.409> study<00:02:01.590> showed<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:01.979> optimistic<00:02:02.670> brains

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
2011 study showed that optimistic brains

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.630 
2011 study showed that optimistic brains

can dig into misinformation just as

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.059 
can dig into misinformation just as
readily<00:02:06.000> as<00:02:06.329> pessimists<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:07.350> researchers<00:02:07.890> ask

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
readily as pessimists so researchers ask

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.680 
readily as pessimists so researchers ask
people<00:02:08.340> do<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.489> estimate<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.030> likeliness<00:02:09.420> of
