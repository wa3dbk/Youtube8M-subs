00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:09.059
 Good, we're going to install the 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.130
 Tempered glass film 65 gao 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.269
 the installation is important that the 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.029
 It is very clean unit is the cleaning can 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.520
 be made with this flannel or if it 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.619
 very greasy you can use a 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.260
 clean glass for cleaning 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.519
 only that is to have to withdraw well until the before 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.090
 to make the application 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.289
 for what the film has a vision 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.420
 perfect 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.670
 it is important that there are no up 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.760
 listening in dust because this causes 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:53.039
 the film is left with air bubbles 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:54.000
 then our cleaning first good after 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.260
 the cleaning 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.260
 We are going to get the movie. 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.890
 I'll position it first on the screen 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.719
 just to see straight - laced as it is 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.210
 centering the film for later 

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:19.119
 remove her protection layer 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.119
 then that movie program position 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.429
 She's going to stay with her, she's well centered. 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:08.869
 now just go pass the flannel that 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:12.940
 the air will automatically go out walking 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.940
 in perfect its application
