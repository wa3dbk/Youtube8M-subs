fully complete a lap with this car
requires<00:00:27.960> hell<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.529> lot<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.680> concentration

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
requires hell of a lot of concentration

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.500 
requires hell of a lot of concentration
compared<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.789> other<00:00:29.880> sports<00:00:30.090> classic

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510

compared to the other sports classic
within<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:30.779> category<00:00:31.040> the<00:00:32.040> reason<00:00:32.550> for<00:00:32.669> that

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
within this category the reason for that

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.060 
within this category the reason for that
is<00:00:32.940> because<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.360> its<00:00:33.480> handling<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.469> overstays

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
is because of its handling the overstays

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.410 
is because of its handling the overstays
hell<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.370> lot<00:00:35.489> at<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.700> same<00:00:35.730> time<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.300> can

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
hell of a lot at the same time it can

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.940 
hell of a lot at the same time it can
also<00:00:36.480> understand<00:00:37.230> uh<00:00:37.260> paying<00:00:37.440> attention<00:00:37.829> and

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
also understand uh paying attention and

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.290 
also understand uh paying attention and
going<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.219> high<00:00:38.489> rate<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.700> speed<00:00:38.910> around<00:00:39.090> these

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
going a high rate of speed around these

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.760 
going a high rate of speed around these
corners<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.140> could<00:00:40.260> pay<00:00:40.410> attention<00:00:40.710> to

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
corners so you could pay attention to

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.560 
corners so you could pay attention to
the<00:00:40.829> brakes<00:00:41.040> as<00:00:41.160> well<00:00:41.190> because<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.579> brakes<00:00:41.910> do

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
the brakes as well because the brakes do

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.900 
the brakes as well because the brakes do
actually<00:00:43.020> suck<00:00:43.860> compared<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.730> other

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
actually suck compared to the other

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.819 
actually suck compared to the other
sports<00:00:45.180> classics<00:00:45.629> as<00:00:45.780> it's<00:00:46.469> quite<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> heavy

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
sports classics as it's quite a heavy

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.440 
sports classics as it's quite a heavy
class<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.309> lot<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.520> momentum<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:48.059> dragged<00:00:48.300> along

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
class a lot of momentum is dragged along

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.479 
class a lot of momentum is dragged along
these<00:00:48.750> corners<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.620> your<00:00:49.800> braking<00:00:50.100> points<00:00:50.399> are

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
these corners so your braking points are

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.860 
these corners so your braking points are
slightly<00:00:50.670> different<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.180> your<00:00:51.300> other<00:00:51.360> cars<00:00:51.660> in

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
slightly different to your other cars in

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.540 
slightly different to your other cars in
this<00:00:51.960> category<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.250> gotta<00:00:53.370> pay<00:00:53.520> attention

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
this category so you gotta pay attention

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.100 
this category so you gotta pay attention
a<00:00:53.940> lot<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.210> things<00:00:54.390> with<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.570> cards<00:00:54.870> actually

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
a lot of things with this cards actually

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.740 
a lot of things with this cards actually
optimize<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.620> i<00:00:55.800> really<00:00:56.399> perfect<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.910> but

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
optimize it i really perfect it but

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.270 
optimize it i really perfect it but
that's<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.469> only<00:00:58.559> thing<00:00:58.649> sort<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:58.920> stopping

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
that's the only thing sort of stopping

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.430 
that's the only thing sort of stopping
your<00:00:59.370> announce<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.940> course<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:01.140> selves

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
your announce of the course so it selves

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.840 
your announce of the course so it selves
pretty<00:01:01.620> much<00:01:01.739> fine<00:01:02.039> but<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.370> handling<00:01:02.699> is

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
pretty much fine but the handling is

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.820 
pretty much fine but the handling is
quite<00:01:03.600> poor<00:01:03.930> but<00:01:03.960> then<00:01:04.229> again<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.559> could<00:01:04.650> say

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
quite poor but then again you could say

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.469 
quite poor but then again you could say
it's<00:01:04.979> really<00:01:05.070> good<00:01:05.189> for<00:01:05.430> your<00:01:05.489> into<00:01:06.090> drifting

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
it's really good for your into drifting

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.450 
it's really good for your into drifting
as<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:07.229> car<00:01:07.439> seemed<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.770> drift<00:01:07.920> quite<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> bit

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
as the car seemed to drift quite a bit

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.750 
as the car seemed to drift quite a bit
of<00:01:09.390> course<00:01:09.600> Monro<00:01:09.960> nava<00:01:10.170> hand<00:01:10.409> square<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.580> much

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
of course Monro nava hand square so much

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.640 
of course Monro nava hand square so much
better<00:01:12.000> for<00:01:12.180> handling<00:01:12.390> goes<00:01:13.020> around<00:01:13.260> corner

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
better for handling goes around corner

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.020 
better for handling goes around corner
much<00:01:13.799> better<00:01:14.040> but<00:01:14.520> also<00:01:14.610> at<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.850> same<00:01:14.970> time

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
much better but also at the same time

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.910 
much better but also at the same time
it's<00:01:15.420> got<00:01:15.540> obviously<00:01:16.409> much<00:01:16.770> better

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
it's got obviously much better

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.560 
it's got obviously much better
attraction<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.610> whatnot<00:01:17.880> now<00:01:18.270> here's<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
attraction and whatnot now here's the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.890 
attraction and whatnot now here's the
thing<00:01:18.689> about<00:01:19.100> acceleration<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:21.000> quick

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
thing about acceleration the quick

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.359 
thing about acceleration the quick
classic<00:01:22.320> actually<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:22.740> goes<00:01:22.920> up<00:01:22.950> right<00:01:23.250> at

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
classic actually just goes up right at

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.730 
classic actually just goes up right at
the<00:01:23.400> back<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.840> it's<00:01:24.840> only<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.049> three<00:01:25.290> speed<00:01:25.530> so

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
the back and it's only a three speed so

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.950 
the back and it's only a three speed so
it<00:01:25.830> goes<00:01:25.920> up<00:01:26.100> for<00:01:26.250> third<00:01:26.400> gear<00:01:26.580> only

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
it goes up for third gear only

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.870 
it goes up for third gear only
but<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.140> Monro<00:01:28.829> itself<00:01:29.220> will<00:01:29.369> eventually

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
but the Monro itself will eventually

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.120 
but the Monro itself will eventually
slowly<00:01:30.119> catch<00:01:30.420> up<00:01:30.600> with<00:01:30.750> you'll<00:01:30.869> notice<00:01:31.200> but

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
slowly catch up with you'll notice but

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.649 
slowly catch up with you'll notice but
it<00:01:32.250> does<00:01:32.400> take<00:01:32.640> quite<00:01:32.820> some<00:01:33.119> time<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.570> this

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
it does take quite some time so this

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.359 
it does take quite some time so this
gives<00:01:33.869> us<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.079> information<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.100> short

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
gives us the information on the short

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.530 
gives us the information on the short
track<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:36.570> classic<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.290> rather<00:01:37.500> competitive

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
track the classic is rather competitive

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.929 
track the classic is rather competitive
from<00:01:39.540> what<00:01:39.689> we<00:01:39.810> see<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.140> far<00:01:40.549> but<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.759> only

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
from what we see so far but the only

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.730 
from what we see so far but the only
downside<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.360> if<00:01:42.630> you're<00:01:42.810> not<00:01:42.930> quite<00:01:43.710> a

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
downside is if you're not quite a

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.530 
downside is if you're not quite a
straight<00:01:44.100> track<00:01:44.399> or<00:01:44.670> with<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.820> quite<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.149> bit<00:01:45.360> for

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
straight track or with a quite a bit for

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.770 
straight track or with a quite a bit for
curvy<00:01:45.930> straights<00:01:46.680> then<00:01:47.119> this<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.240> where<00:01:48.450> other

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
curvy straights then this is where other

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.389 
curvy straights then this is where other
sports<00:01:49.049> classics<00:01:49.500> may<00:01:49.860> seem<00:01:50.070> like<00:01:50.280> all

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
sports classics may seem like all

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.649 
sports classics may seem like all
dominate<00:01:50.820> but<00:01:50.970> at<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.090> same<00:01:51.210> time<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.570> could

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
dominate but at the same time you could

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.990 
dominate but at the same time you could
say<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:52.250> don't<00:01:53.250> know<00:01:53.310> its<00:01:53.520> cause<00:01:53.729> what<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
say I don't know its cause what the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.539 
say I don't know its cause what the
balance<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.420> cars<00:01:54.659> very<00:01:55.140> well<00:01:55.439> balanced<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.159> I

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
balance is cars very well balanced and I

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.399 
balance is cars very well balanced and I
love<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.090> fact<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.719> requires<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.200> lot<00:01:58.380> of

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
love the fact that it requires a lot of

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.649 
love the fact that it requires a lot of
concentration<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:59.100> actually<00:01:59.579> fully<00:01:59.850> reaches

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
concentration to actually fully reaches

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.480 
concentration to actually fully reaches
maximum<00:02:00.960> potential<00:02:01.380> because<00:02:01.920> as<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.159> said<00:02:02.219> not

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
maximum potential because as I said not

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.859 
maximum potential because as I said not
everyone<00:02:02.790> can<00:02:03.030> use<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.630> see

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
everyone can use this so you see

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.050 
everyone can use this so you see
significant<00:02:04.439> difference<00:02:04.710> between<00:02:04.860> lap<00:02:05.759> times

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
significant difference between lap times

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.370 
significant difference between lap times
from<00:02:06.270> everybody

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
from everybody

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.080 
from everybody
no<00:02:07.860> not<00:02:08.009> everybody<00:02:08.220> will<00:02:08.459> get<00:02:08.580> their<00:02:08.640> similar

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
no not everybody will get their similar

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.240 
no not everybody will get their similar
lap<00:02:09.239> times<00:02:09.509> with<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.750> few<00:02:09.989> milliseconds<00:02:10.709> it's

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
lap times with a few milliseconds it's

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
lap times with a few milliseconds it's
going<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.459> be

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
going to be

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.940 
going to be
massive<00:02:12.660> gaps<00:02:12.930> between<00:02:13.170> everyone<00:02:13.680> when

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
massive gaps between everyone when

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.860 
massive gaps between everyone when
everyone<00:02:14.490> uses<00:02:14.790> this<00:02:14.850> class<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:15.360> racing<00:02:15.780> with

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
everyone uses this class so racing with

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.960 
everyone uses this class so racing with
this<00:02:15.990> car<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.290> can<00:02:16.410> see<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.890> definitely<00:02:17.760> towel

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
this car you can see a definitely towel

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.300 
this car you can see a definitely towel
who<00:02:18.720> can<00:02:19.050> actually<00:02:19.380> adapt<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.770> something<00:02:20.130> like

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
who can actually adapt to something like

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.250 
who can actually adapt to something like
this<00:02:20.490> because<00:02:20.760> as<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.390> said<00:02:21.570> this<00:02:21.690> car<00:02:21.900> in<00:02:22.140> my

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
this because as I said this car in my

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.890 
this because as I said this car in my
opinion<00:02:22.560> requires<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.430> most<00:02:23.580> skill<00:02:23.940> out<00:02:24.780> of

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
opinion requires the most skill out of

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.540 
opinion requires the most skill out of
the<00:02:24.960> sports<00:02:25.200> classic<00:02:25.590> even<00:02:26.070> out<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.430> whole

the sports classic even out of the whole
game<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.790> be<00:02:27.030> honest<00:02:27.270> because<00:02:27.390> over<00:02:28.290> in<00:02:28.380> I<00:02:28.470> know

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
game to be honest because over in I know

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.630 
game to be honest because over in I know
if<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.710> thought<00:02:28.890> was<00:02:29.040> pretty<00:02:29.130> difficult<00:02:29.370> to

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
if I thought was pretty difficult to

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.310 
if I thought was pretty difficult to
control<00:02:29.910> at<00:02:30.120> first<00:02:30.330> but<00:02:30.480> then<00:02:30.630> when<00:02:30.960> this<00:02:31.140> car

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
control at first but then when this car

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.150 
control at first but then when this car
came<00:02:31.350> along<00:02:31.650> Wow

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
came along Wow

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.940 
came along Wow
so<00:02:32.760> anyway<00:02:33.170> doing<00:02:34.170> I'm<00:02:34.290> on<00:02:34.380> ride<00:02:34.590> better<00:02:34.740> top

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
so anyway doing I'm on ride better top

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.430 
so anyway doing I'm on ride better top
speed<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.510> quick<00:02:36.510> classes<00:02:36.840> got<00:02:36.990> more<00:02:37.200> talk

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
speed and quick classes got more talk

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.030 
speed and quick classes got more talk
but<00:02:38.340> damage<00:02:38.610> test<00:02:39.350> did<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.440> several<00:02:40.590> time<00:02:40.830> just

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
but damage test did it several time just

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.990 
but damage test did it several time just
to<00:02:41.130> make<00:02:41.160> sure<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.580> numbers<00:02:41.850> were

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
to make sure the numbers were

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.810 
to make sure the numbers were

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.300 
customizable options the quick quick has
got<00:02:55.590> quite<00:02:55.800> a<00:02:55.830> few

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
got quite a few

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.040 
got quite a few
you<00:02:56.700> know<00:02:56.820> quite<00:02:57.090> random<00:02:57.420> but<00:02:57.600> you<00:02:57.690> know<00:02:57.810> quite

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
you know quite random but you know quite

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.960 
you know quite random but you know quite
a<00:02:58.080> few<00:02:58.140> bumper<00:02:58.590> options<00:02:58.980> but<00:02:59.130> then<00:02:59.250> hardly<00:02:59.850> any

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
a few bumper options but then hardly any

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
other options for anything else so it's

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.800

enough<00:03:04.260> carbon<00:03:04.560> for<00:03:04.740> a<00:03:04.770> hood<00:03:04.920> at<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.100> front

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
enough carbon for a hood at the front

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.050 
enough carbon for a hood at the front
and<00:03:05.490> it's<00:03:06.120> got<00:03:06.360> um<00:03:06.830> nice<00:03:07.830> roll<00:03:08.400> cage<00:03:08.640> I<00:03:08.790> suppose

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
and it's got um nice roll cage I suppose

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.580 
and it's got um nice roll cage I suppose
which<00:03:09.330> kind<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:09.570> just<00:03:09.810> like<00:03:09.960> comes<00:03:10.470> off

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
which kind of just like comes off

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.710 
which kind of just like comes off
tangent<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.550> quite<00:03:11.910> a<00:03:11.940> few<00:03:12.120> exhaust<00:03:12.450> pipes

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
tangent and quite a few exhaust pipes

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.670 
tangent and quite a few exhaust pipes
but<00:03:12.930> that's<00:03:13.050> pretty<00:03:13.140> much<00:03:13.260> it

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
but that's pretty much it

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.380 
but that's pretty much it
every<00:03:14.250> analysis<00:03:14.370> just<00:03:14.880> it<00:03:14.970> is<00:03:15.060> where<00:03:15.180> it<00:03:15.270> is

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
every analysis just it is where it is

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.080 
every analysis just it is where it is
just<00:03:15.660> love<00:03:16.350> for<00:03:16.470> much<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.860> it<00:03:17.010> but<00:03:17.760> for<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:17.940> one

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
just love for much to it but for the one

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
other man so gets a bit tricky at times

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.050 
other man so gets a bit tricky at times
I<00:03:35.580> really<00:03:36.450> detest<00:03:36.600> it<00:03:36.870> fully<00:03:37.140> out<00:03:37.350> and<00:03:38.060> scare

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
I really detest it fully out and scare

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.860 
I really detest it fully out and scare
ofin<00:03:39.360> on<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:40.200> spot<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:41.070> precise<00:03:41.670> because<00:03:41.970> you

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
ofin on the spot and precise because you

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.570 
ofin on the spot and precise because you
know<00:03:43.020> this<00:03:43.500> comes<00:03:43.800> down<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.190> milliseconds

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580

people<00:03:45.180> now<00:03:45.780> think<00:03:46.560> about<00:03:46.800> a<00:03:46.830> cooker<00:03:47.100> classic

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520

alright<00:03:48.260> breaking<00:03:49.260> points<00:03:49.560> are<00:03:49.650> crucial

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
alright breaking points are crucial

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.440 
alright breaking points are crucial
because<00:03:50.250> if<00:03:50.550> you<00:03:50.640> get<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:50.850> breaking<00:03:51.180> point

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
because if you get the breaking point

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.720 
because if you get the breaking point
wrong<00:03:51.630> then<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:52.290> car<00:03:52.500> will<00:03:52.680> literally<00:03:52.980> get
