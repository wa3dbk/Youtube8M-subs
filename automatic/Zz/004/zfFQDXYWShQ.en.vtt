we<00:00:52.890> have<00:00:53.070> branches<00:00:53.579> which<00:00:54.120> are<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
we have branches which are the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.200 
we have branches which are the

affect the smooth muscle fibers of the

affect the smooth muscle fibers of the
bronchial<00:01:01.710> Airways<00:01:01.890> are<00:01:02.539> autonomic<00:01:03.539> nerves

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
bronchial Airways are autonomic nerves

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.310 
bronchial Airways are autonomic nerves
so<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:05.190> could<00:01:05.430> be<00:01:05.520> either<00:01:05.700> sympathetic<00:01:06.539> from

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
so it could be either sympathetic from

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.460 
so it could be either sympathetic from
the<00:01:08.100> sympathetic<00:01:08.520> trunk<00:01:09.000> or<00:01:09.470> from

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
the sympathetic trunk or from

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.880 
the sympathetic trunk or from
parasympathetic<00:01:11.250> from<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.240> vagus<00:01:12.930> if<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
parasympathetic from the vagus if the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.859 
parasympathetic from the vagus if the
nerve<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.250> blocked<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:15.030> will<00:01:15.270> result<00:01:15.659> in

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
nerve is blocked this will result in

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.380 
nerve is blocked this will result in
relaxation<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.950> smooth<00:01:17.220> muscle<00:01:17.360> so<00:01:18.360> it

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
relaxation of the smooth muscle so it

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.749 
relaxation of the smooth muscle so it
means<00:01:18.750> which<00:01:19.049> nerve<00:01:19.320> causes<00:01:19.799> spasm<00:01:20.610> or

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
means which nerve causes spasm or

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.550 
means which nerve causes spasm or
contraction<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.659> smooth<00:01:22.049> muscle<00:01:22.080> and

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
contraction of the smooth muscle and

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.980 
contraction of the smooth muscle and
these<00:01:23.009> are<00:01:23.340> parasympathetic<00:01:24.119> fibers

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
these are parasympathetic fibers

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.560 
these are parasympathetic fibers
if<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:26.130> parasympathetic<00:01:26.549> fibers<00:01:27.000> are

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
if the parasympathetic fibers are

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.539 
if the parasympathetic fibers are
blocked<00:01:27.930> then<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.799> will<00:01:28.979> result<00:01:29.369> in

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
blocked then this will result in

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.940 
blocked then this will result in
relaxation<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.990> smooth<00:01:31.259> muscle<00:01:31.290> fibers

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
relaxation of the smooth muscle fibers

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.850 
relaxation of the smooth muscle fibers
so<00:01:32.490> which<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.670> these<00:01:33.030> nerves<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.320> five<00:01:34.530> nerves

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
so which of these nerves the five nerves

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.130 
so which of these nerves the five nerves
carry<00:01:35.159> parasympathetic<00:01:35.729> fibers<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:37.020> the

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.979 
from the vagus nerve which will cause
the<00:02:06.079> narrowing<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.439> bronchial<00:02:07.950> tree<00:02:08.190> and

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
the narrowing of the bronchial tree and

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.940 
the narrowing of the bronchial tree and
therefore<00:02:09.989> when<00:02:10.170> they<00:02:10.320> are<00:02:10.440> blocked

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
therefore when they are blocked

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.979 
therefore when they are blocked
they<00:02:11.310> will<00:02:11.489> result<00:02:11.880> in<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.150> relaxation<00:02:12.360> of

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
they will result in the relaxation of

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.990 
they will result in the relaxation of
the<00:02:13.470> smooth<00:02:13.770> muscle<00:02:13.800> fibers<00:02:14.580> of<00:02:14.819> the

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
the smooth muscle fibers of the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.660 
the smooth muscle fibers of the
bronchial<00:02:15.450> Airways
