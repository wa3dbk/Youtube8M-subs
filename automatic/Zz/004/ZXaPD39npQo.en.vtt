00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
in your hand is a little bit difficult

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.240

here's<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.599> battery<00:01:51.780> I've<00:01:52.560> charged<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.130> up

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
here's the battery I've charged it up

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.580 
here's the battery I've charged it up
and<00:01:53.459> it<00:01:54.030> lasts<00:01:54.360> quite<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.630> long<00:01:54.720> time<00:01:55.170> I've

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
and it lasts quite a long time I've

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.990 
and it lasts quite a long time I've
gotten<00:01:55.830> a<00:01:55.890> full<00:01:56.069> two<00:01:56.250> hours<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.580> recording

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
gotten a full two hours of recording

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.940 
gotten a full two hours of recording
with<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.239> battery<00:01:57.630> which<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.989> in<00:01:58.229> my<00:01:58.590> opinion

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
with that battery which is in my opinion

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.150 
with that battery which is in my opinion
a<00:01:59.009> miracle<00:01:59.899> next<00:02:00.899> let's<00:02:01.110> see<00:02:01.380> we<00:02:01.590> have<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.800> strap

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
a miracle next let's see we have a strap

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.880 
a miracle next let's see we have a strap
here<00:02:02.459> which<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:03.119> don't<00:02:03.330> use<00:02:03.539> at<00:02:03.780> all<00:02:03.959> that<00:02:04.500> strap

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
here which I don't use at all that strap

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.040 
here which I don't use at all that strap
is<00:02:05.039> long<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.489> cumbersome<00:02:06.479> gets<00:02:06.690> in<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.899> way

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
is long and cumbersome gets in the way

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.580 
is long and cumbersome gets in the way
so<00:02:07.410> we'll<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:07.619> put<00:02:07.739> that<00:02:07.860> on<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.129> side

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
so we'll just put that on the side

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.900 
so we'll just put that on the side
here's<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.739> power<00:02:10.890> cord<00:02:11.220> part<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.819> plugs

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
here's the power cord part that plugs

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.670 
here's the power cord part that plugs
into<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.390> wall<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:13.170> then<00:02:13.319> goes<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.530> the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
into the wall and then goes to the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.770 
into the wall and then goes to the
charger<00:02:14.129> in<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.280> converter<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:15.120> this<00:02:15.540> is<00:02:15.690> the

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
charger in the converter and this is the

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.089 
charger in the converter and this is the
power<00:02:15.930> cord<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.319> goes<00:02:16.379> from<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.770> converter

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
power cord that goes from the converter

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.530 
power cord that goes from the converter
into<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.459> camera<00:02:17.880> so<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.180> if<00:02:18.270> you<00:02:18.360> want<00:02:18.510> to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
into the camera so that if you want to

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.620 
into the camera so that if you want to
run<00:02:18.690> it<00:02:18.780> off<00:02:18.870> AC<00:02:19.110> power<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.740> can<00:02:19.860> also<00:02:20.010> do<00:02:20.280> that

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
run it off AC power you can also do that

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.000 
run it off AC power you can also do that
here's<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:21.840> charger<00:02:22.260> converter<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:22.710> was

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:06.980 
somewhat less useful if you really want
to<00:05:05.369> frame<00:05:05.580> a<00:05:05.610> tight<00:05:05.909> shot<00:05:06.209> you<00:05:06.360> can<00:05:06.509> use<00:05:06.689> it<00:05:06.839> but

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
to frame a tight shot you can use it but

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.230 
to frame a tight shot you can use it but
yeah<00:05:07.679> just<00:05:08.279> not<00:05:08.519> my<00:05:08.669> favorite<00:05:09.029> thing<00:05:09.059> about

exactly what you're recording and how
you're<00:05:36.089> recording<00:05:36.509> it<00:05:36.629> so<00:05:36.779> you<00:05:37.529> are<00:05:37.709> at<00:05:37.889> the

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
you're recording it so you are at the

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:39.559 
you're recording it so you are at the
bottom<00:05:38.159> of<00:05:38.399> the<00:05:38.550> professional<00:05:39.119> level<00:05:39.269> here

you're definitely beyond the consumer

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:42.859 
you're definitely beyond the consumer

because you have the white of the truck
there<00:06:21.460> and<00:06:21.670> then<00:06:21.940> you<00:06:22.030> have<00:06:22.060> the<00:06:22.270> dark<00:06:22.510> of<00:06:22.660> the

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
ivy and the trees in the background so

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.480 
ivy and the trees in the background so
let's<00:06:25.390> zoom<00:06:25.450> all<00:06:25.780> the<00:06:25.810> way<00:06:25.900> out<00:06:26.340> you'll<00:06:27.340> get<00:06:27.430> a

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490 
let's zoom all the way out you'll get a

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.420 
let's zoom all the way out you'll get a
sense<00:06:27.790> of<00:06:27.910> the<00:06:28.630> range<00:06:28.960> of<00:06:29.170> this<00:06:29.260> lens<00:06:29.530> as<00:06:29.830> well

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430 
sense of the range of this lens as well

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.580 
sense of the range of this lens as well
as<00:06:30.790> how<00:06:30.910> the<00:06:30.970> camera<00:06:31.390> handles<00:06:31.720> changing

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
as how the camera handles changing

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:43.720 
as how the camera handles changing
lighting<00:06:32.770> conditions<00:06:33.310> as<00:06:33.430> it<00:06:33.550> zooms<00:06:33.580> out

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:43.730 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.730 

so<00:06:44.570> there<00:06:44.720> you<00:06:44.840> are<00:06:44.870> that's<00:06:45.080> zoomed<00:06:45.440> all<00:06:45.710> the

so there you are that's zoomed all the

so there you are that's zoomed all the
