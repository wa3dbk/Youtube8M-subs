custom playbook you know I actually like

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.910 
custom playbook you know I actually like
to<00:02:29.610> come<00:02:29.790> out<00:02:29.820> as<00:02:30.060> my<00:02:30.180> base<00:02:30.390> play<00:02:30.660> because<00:02:31.560> what

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
to come out as my base play because what

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.900 
to come out as my base play because what
it<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.250> have<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.400> running<00:02:32.580> back<00:02:32.760> in<00:02:32.790> the

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
it you have a running back in the

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.390 
it you have a running back in the
backfield<00:02:32.970> so<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:33.630> allows<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.400> audible

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
backfield so it allows you to audible

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.510 
backfield so it allows you to audible
audible<00:02:36.150> up<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.770> five<00:02:37.770> wide<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:38.250> if<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.400> come

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
audible up to five wide so if you come

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.220 
audible up to five wide so if you come
out<00:02:38.580> of<00:02:38.700> five<00:02:38.850> wide<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.660> only<00:02:39.840> downside

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
out of five wide that the only downside

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.080 
out of five wide that the only downside
is<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:40.440> can't<00:02:40.620> audible<00:02:41.010> down<00:02:41.160> in<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.880> things

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
is you can't audible down in the things

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.420 
is you can't audible down in the things
but<00:02:42.209> if<00:02:42.300> you<00:02:42.330> can't<00:02:42.540> come<00:02:42.840> in<00:02:42.990> out<00:02:43.290> in<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:44.310> know

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
but if you can't come in out in you know

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.800 
but if you can't come in out in you know
if<00:02:44.580> you<00:02:44.670> have<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.790> running<00:02:45.510> back<00:02:45.630> in<00:02:45.780> the

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
if you have a running back in the

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.810 
if you have a running back in the
backfield<00:02:45.870> or<00:02:46.320> whatever<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:47.280> can<00:02:47.459> audible

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
backfield or whatever you can audible

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.180 
backfield or whatever you can audible
down<00:02:48.000> in<00:02:48.150> two<00:02:48.270> different<00:02:48.420> things

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
down in two different things

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.530 
down in two different things
so<00:02:50.190> that's<00:02:50.430> why<00:02:50.550> I<00:02:50.580> don't<00:02:51.000> come<00:02:51.150> out<00:02:51.300> in<00:02:51.390> five

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
so that's why I don't come out in five

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.100 
so that's why I don't come out in five
wide<00:02:51.810> anymore<00:02:52.940> and<00:02:53.940> so<00:02:54.209> you<00:02:54.270> know<00:02:54.510> I'm<00:02:54.570> locking

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
wide anymore and so you know I'm locking

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.750 
wide anymore and so you know I'm locking
this<00:02:55.350> game<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.709> still<00:02:56.070> think<00:02:56.250> it's<00:02:56.370> one<00:02:56.580> patch

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
this game I still think it's one patch

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.880 
this game I still think it's one patch
away<00:02:57.030> from<00:02:57.209> being<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.480> great<00:02:57.840> great<00:02:58.140> game<00:02:58.350> you

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
and this was the worst decision I made

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.330 
and this was the worst decision I made
all<00:04:45.880> game<00:04:46.090> it<00:04:46.810> was<00:04:47.020> it<00:04:47.470> was<00:04:47.620> so<00:04:47.770> stupid<00:04:47.979> look<00:04:48.250> at

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
all game it was it was so stupid look at

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.010 
all game it was it was so stupid look at
X<00:04:48.550> wide<00:04:49.030> open

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
X wide open

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.080 
X wide open
easy<00:04:50.440> easy<00:04:50.830> pass<00:04:51.160> Lee<00:04:51.400> to<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.639> inside<00:04:51.910> that's

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
easy easy pass Lee to the inside that's

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.420 
easy easy pass Lee to the inside that's
why<00:04:52.210> I<00:04:52.240> zoomed<00:04:52.570> in<00:04:52.690> right<00:04:52.900> there<00:04:53.080> but<00:04:53.889> you<00:04:54.310> know

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
why I zoomed in right there but you know

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.640 
why I zoomed in right there but you know
I<00:04:54.460> made<00:04:54.850> the<00:04:54.970> bad<00:04:55.090> read<00:04:55.389> and<00:04:55.570> and<00:04:55.900> batteries

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
I made the bad read and and batteries

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.629 
I made the bad read and and batteries
were<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:56.860> only<00:04:56.979> thing<00:04:57.190> that<00:04:57.310> slows<00:04:57.460> me<00:04:57.610> down

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
were the only thing that slows me down

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.040 
were the only thing that slows me down
on<00:04:57.880> offense<00:04:58.180> for<00:04:58.300> the<00:04:58.479> most<00:04:58.660> part<00:04:58.840> I<00:04:58.870> haven't

just gotta cut out some of the batteries
just<00:05:07.300> you<00:05:08.080> know<00:05:08.699> use<00:05:09.699> a<00:05:09.729> little<00:05:10.150> bit<00:05:10.240> less

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
just you know use a little bit less

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.379 
just you know use a little bit less
place<00:05:10.720> probably<00:05:11.050> and<00:05:11.530> and<00:05:12.280> make<00:05:13.000> sure<00:05:13.150> I<00:05:13.180> have

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
place probably and and make sure I have

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.749 
place probably and and make sure I have
my<00:05:13.570> reads<00:05:13.810> down<00:05:14.020> on<00:05:14.199> those<00:05:14.349> plays<00:05:14.590> and<00:05:14.860> and<00:05:15.370> mix

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:15.759 
my reads down on those plays and and mix

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:17.909 
my reads down on those plays and and mix
up<00:05:15.910> everything<00:05:16.330> everything<00:05:16.750> nicely<00:05:17.620> and<00:05:17.740> have

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
up everything everything nicely and have

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.189 
up everything everything nicely and have
my<00:05:18.070> reads<00:05:18.310> down<00:05:18.550> completely<00:05:19.479> instead<00:05:19.990> of<00:05:20.080> just

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 
my reads down completely instead of just

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:21.930 
my reads down completely instead of just
going<00:05:20.440> to<00:05:20.560> a<00:05:20.680> couple<00:05:21.039> more<00:05:21.190> I'm<00:05:21.490> probably

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
going to a couple more I'm probably

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.400 
going to a couple more I'm probably
using<00:05:22.270> a<00:05:22.300> little<00:05:22.389> bit<00:05:22.479> too<00:05:22.690> many<00:05:23.080> different

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
using a little bit too many different

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.050 
using a little bit too many different
types<00:05:23.530> of<00:05:23.650> plays<00:05:23.830> I<00:05:24.130> just<00:05:24.400> have<00:05:24.639> too<00:05:24.759> much<00:05:24.849> fun

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
definitely need to lock that up a little

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.140 
definitely need to lock that up a little
bit<00:05:28.810> better<00:05:28.979> so<00:05:29.979> we<00:05:30.099> got<00:05:30.250> a<00:05:30.280> tie<00:05:30.550> game<00:05:30.610> twenty
