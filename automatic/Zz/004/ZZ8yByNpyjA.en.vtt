00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
with casters because of this I thought

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.440 
with casters because of this I thought
they<00:02:35.110> were<00:02:35.170> impossible<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.890> manage<00:02:36.330> what<00:02:37.330> you

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
they were impossible to manage what you

they were impossible to manage what you

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
want to do is real easy you run into the

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.390 
want to do is real easy you run into the
pack<00:02:40.120> you<00:02:40.600> get<00:02:40.810> some<00:02:41.080> aggro<00:02:41.500> then<00:02:41.920> you<00:02:42.160> figure

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
pack you get some aggro then you figure

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.789 
pack you get some aggro then you figure
out<00:02:42.549> where<00:02:42.790> your<00:02:42.970> casters<00:02:43.480> are<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:43.959> then<00:02:44.440> you

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
out where your casters are and then you

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.979 
out where your casters are and then you
do<00:02:44.980> your<00:02:45.010> long-distance<00:02:45.430> interrupt<00:02:46.269> if<00:02:46.510> there

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
do your long-distance interrupt if there

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.990 
do your long-distance interrupt if there
are<00:02:47.110> two<00:02:47.290> casters<00:02:47.860> you<00:02:47.980> stand<00:02:48.310> near<00:02:48.489> one<00:02:48.760> and

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
silence the other so that he runs over

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.789

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
then the two casters will be closed in

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.289 
then the two casters will be closed in
the<00:02:53.860> melee<00:02:54.220> enemies<00:02:54.640> will<00:02:54.820> sort<00:02:55.120> themselves

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
tricks in action you're going to see

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.600 
tricks in action you're going to see
right<00:05:13.580> off<00:05:13.610> the<00:05:14.030> bat<00:05:14.240> I<00:05:14.539> do<00:05:14.630> the<00:05:15.370> long<00:05:16.370> distance

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
right off the bat I do the long distance

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.719 
right off the bat I do the long distance
interrupt<00:05:17.419> and<00:05:17.660> pull<00:05:18.050> over<00:05:18.440> and<00:05:18.680> now<00:05:19.430> we<00:05:19.490> get<00:05:19.669> a

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729 
interrupt and pull over and now we get a

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:21.820 
interrupt and pull over and now we get a
nice<00:05:19.940> group<00:05:20.300> going<00:05:20.539> so<00:05:20.930> now<00:05:21.139> I'm<00:05:21.470> thinking

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
nice group going so now I'm thinking

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.460 
nice group going so now I'm thinking
about<00:05:21.919> the<00:05:22.400> the<00:05:22.849> space<00:05:23.150> ahead<00:05:23.389> of<00:05:23.630> me<00:05:23.720> and<00:05:24.260> when

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
about the the space ahead of me and when

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:25.750 
about the the space ahead of me and when
you're<00:05:24.620> doing<00:05:24.889> that<00:05:25.010> you<00:05:25.160> got<00:05:25.310> to<00:05:25.400> be<00:05:25.520> like

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
you're doing that you got to be like

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.779
