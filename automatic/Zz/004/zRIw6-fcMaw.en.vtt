00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 I would like to show you some steps today 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.759
 what we need for that and how 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.970
 I'll show you the whole thing 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.970
 now 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.529
 as ingredients we need two steaks there 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:29.109
 I now have 2 500 gram sticks 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.550
 from new zealand are then we need 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.769
 a bit of iceberg lettuce a bit 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.879
 paprika red paprika taken a 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:37.960
 bit of cheese grated cheese and 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.519
 we also need onions onions 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.379
 after that for the web what we got then 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:45.220
 In addition, it is necessary 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.899
 a sauce for the rap I have now 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.339
 here a cup of cream fraiche taken 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.550
 a bit of tabasco a bit of salt 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:52.360
 and prepares me now 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.670
 now concentrate on the first 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.590
 stades it is very often said that 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.500
 stakes fire please do not salt I'm 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.269
 hold the opinion if that brings something 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.039
 or not it does not matter i set it 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.110
 always before that is called the steaks and 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.149
 just grill on more direct strength 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.670
 heat per page approximately 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:11.190
 I'll say three minutes but then 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.509
 more 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.580
 while the first side of the stick at 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.409
 we can get the cream for 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.220
 to do this, the cups of cream fraiche in 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.050
 give a key 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.580
 a bit tabasco or a lot 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.380
 make tabasco rhyme and then something 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.970
 salting and then tasting 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.570
 and that was actually it already 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.369
 The cream is ready for the crib 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.680
 Rapeseed concentrate us completely now 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.210
 I lean on the steaks I grille the 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.670
 the court will be staked per page 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.270
 I only mentioned three minutes each 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.920
 after one and a half minutes it turned to 45 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.420
 most say 90 degrees and 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.860
 better grill needs or bigger 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.020
 Christa I get hold of it 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.350
 nice so 540 degrees is turned so 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.240
 about one and a half minutes and thus 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.700
 If you come then per page then it works 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.100
 on both sides per page then on 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.140
 then three minutes for the stick 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.640
 I always ask how do you do that 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.500
 actually with the steak on the weber 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.850
 120 because that must also be an indirect one 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.990
 little pull plus there's a very 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.269
 simple trick succeeds simple 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.740
 key for this with water on this 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.350
 bowl comes then stop 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.750
 gitta on this grid then come the 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.420
 the steaks he then already before 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.300
 turned out of it turned the grill 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.490
 including from low heat and leads 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.260
 A bowl of cold water on in 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.700
 the time where the faces and me then 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.660
 stopped to collect in one 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.400
 Indirect area is generated is the 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.920
 desired degree achieved so I am 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.900
 stop fan of I say 56 degrees now 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.600
 people say 54 degrees core temperature 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.550
 I like to grow 56 degrees 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.440
 Let's get the steak off the grill 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.970
 then about another minute on 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.090
 pull the board and then we can 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.730
 then we have to prove it so slowly 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.170
 make of the web before we get the rap willing 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.240
 we have to steak of course 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.980
 logically cut small tranches 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.930
 or thin strips cut that 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.510
 because just cut very thin with 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.510
 spice a little salt additionally 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.040
 and then we put the bed we put 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.500
 now the webs and we start 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.270
 with the cream that was earlier with the 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.010
 matching sentence have mixed nice 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.840
 centrally distribute as smoking and 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.060
 Iceberg lettuce and on top of this iceberg lettuce 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.680
 the chopped paprika - 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.710
 of course before that music cut 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.150
 in addition, the onion beautiful 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.660
 nice little rings then about it 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.970
 distribute, and on this pad comes a 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.550
 Now the steak has the drunk of the 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.960
 stick on top we make it 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.910
 currently salt a bit more 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.080
 then comes the cheese and cheese 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.910
 then the web can be rolled up 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.740
 So that was the grip if you guys 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.650
 I like the thumb for this video 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.060
 video and if only not done 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.350
 you can you me but that finds its 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.120
 as always at the bottom 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.560
 for more tips and tricks, look up
