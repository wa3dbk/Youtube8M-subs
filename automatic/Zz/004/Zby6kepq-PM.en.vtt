 the word simply to tell you 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.479
 I want a little idea 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.550

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.300
 it's a moment that I have not done 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.200

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.619
 in quotation marks around the world 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.060

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.610
 not paint a top 10 but a video 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:07.520

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.280
 will be someone you put in 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.480

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.220

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.530

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.910
 in any case in private ie as 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.500
