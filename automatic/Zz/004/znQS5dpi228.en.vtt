hello and welcome to the video that

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.640 
hello and welcome to the video that
hopefully<00:00:08.820> explains<00:00:09.510> away<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.960> nightmare

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
hopefully explains away the nightmare

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.129 
hopefully explains away the nightmare
that<00:00:11.280> as<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.610> water<00:00:12.150> works<00:00:12.570> roundabouts

reproaching via the Lee bridge road now
it's<00:00:18.300> another<00:00:18.930> half-mile<00:00:19.560> away<00:00:19.590> but<00:00:20.160> let<00:00:20.369> me

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
it's another half-mile away but let me

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.220 
it's another half-mile away but let me
just<00:00:20.490> take<00:00:20.820> some<00:00:21.029> time<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.630> show<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:21.900> one<00:00:22.140> or

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
just take some time to show you one or

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.620 
just take some time to show you one or
two<00:00:22.260> things<00:00:22.650> we<00:00:22.830> need<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:22.980> deal<00:00:23.220> with<00:00:23.630> firstly

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
two things we need to deal with firstly

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.380 
two things we need to deal with firstly
the<00:00:24.750> limit<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.199> 40<00:00:25.890> miles<00:00:26.039> per<00:00:26.130> hour<00:00:26.220> but<00:00:27.029> as

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
the limit is 40 miles per hour but as

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.630 
the limit is 40 miles per hour but as
you<00:00:27.720> can<00:00:27.840> see<00:00:28.140> we've<00:00:28.470> got<00:00:28.500> some<00:00:28.920> hazards<00:00:29.609> like

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
you can see we've got some hazards like

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.759 
you can see we've got some hazards like
for<00:00:29.910> example<00:00:29.970> but<00:00:30.779> bless<00:00:30.990> your<00:00:31.109> crossing<00:00:31.590> and

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
for example but bless your crossing and

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:40.069 
for example but bless your crossing and
the<00:00:32.340> school<00:00:32.640> kids<00:00:32.850> at<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.239> bus<00:00:33.420> stop<00:00:39.079> skipping

forward<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.680> bit<00:00:40.800> we're<00:00:41.309> now<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.730> bit<00:00:42.120> closer<00:00:42.510> to

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
forward a bit we're now a bit closer to

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.680 
forward a bit we're now a bit closer to
the<00:00:42.809> roundabout<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.829> single<00:00:44.430> lane<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.820> about

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
the roundabout this single lane is about

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.069 
the roundabout this single lane is about
to<00:00:45.899> split<00:00:46.230> into<00:00:46.469> two<00:00:46.969> when<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.090> does<00:00:48.360> we<00:00:48.989> need

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
to split into two when it does we need

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.139 
to split into two when it does we need
to<00:00:49.260> stay<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.039> right<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.789> we're<00:00:50.940> in

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
to stay to the right so that we're in

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.459 
to stay to the right so that we're in
the<00:00:51.300> right<00:00:51.510> handling<00:00:52.020> from<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.039> beginning

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
the right handling from the beginning

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.470 
the right handling from the beginning
now<00:00:55.469> if<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:55.980> take<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.219> look<00:00:56.460> at<00:00:56.699> one<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.239> two

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
now if we take a look at one of the two

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.150 
now if we take a look at one of the two
signs<00:00:57.840> on<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.410> approach<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.949> roundabout

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
signs on the approach to the roundabout

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.569 
signs on the approach to the roundabout
you<00:01:00.059> can<00:01:00.180> see<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.780> appears<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.620> have<00:01:01.800> five

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
you can see that it appears to have five

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.179 
you can see that it appears to have five
exits<00:01:03.149> but<00:01:03.359> don't<00:01:03.690> let<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:03.870> fool<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
exits but don't let that fool you the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.640 
exits but don't let that fool you the
opening<00:01:05.729> at<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.030> top<00:01:06.270> left-hand<00:01:07.020> corner<00:01:07.200> and

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
opening at the top left-hand corner and

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.830 
opening at the top left-hand corner and
the<00:01:08.220> bottom<00:01:08.250> right-hand<00:01:08.880> corner<00:01:09.090> that

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
the bottom right-hand corner that

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.870 
the bottom right-hand corner that
actually<00:01:10.110> enters<00:01:10.650> us<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.250> roundabouts<00:01:11.610> as

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
actually enters us to the roundabouts as

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.420 
actually enters us to the roundabouts as
you<00:01:12.360> can<00:01:12.479> see<00:01:12.720> from<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.530> picture<00:01:13.890> taken<00:01:14.250> from

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
you can see from the picture taken from

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.749 
you can see from the picture taken from
above<00:01:18.470> unusually<00:01:19.470> it's<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.040> right-hand<00:01:20.580> lane

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
above unusually it's the right-hand lane

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.630 
above unusually it's the right-hand lane
which<00:01:20.909> splits<00:01:21.500> so<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.619> makes<00:01:22.830> three<00:01:23.400> lanes

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
which splits so that makes three lanes

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.670 
which splits so that makes three lanes
now<00:01:23.909> what<00:01:24.659> we<00:01:24.720> need<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.930> do<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.290> get<00:01:25.590> ourselves

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
now what we need to do is get ourselves

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.490 
now what we need to do is get ourselves
into<00:01:26.159> lane<00:01:26.460> number<00:01:26.610> three<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:27.840> car<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.290> front

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
into lane number three the car in front

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.740 
into lane number three the car in front
the<00:01:28.799> silver<00:01:29.130> car<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.579> also<00:01:30.090> signalling<00:01:30.600> right

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
the silver car is also signalling right

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.600 
the silver car is also signalling right
but<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.020> find<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.590> positioning<00:01:32.040> works<00:01:32.369> best

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
but I find this positioning works best

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.399 
but I find this positioning works best
looking<00:01:35.610> again<00:01:35.820> at<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.270> aerial<00:01:36.689> picture<00:01:37.110> you

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
looking again at the aerial picture you

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.649 
looking again at the aerial picture you
can<00:01:37.560> see<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.070> on<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.729> roundabout<00:01:39.090> there<00:01:39.479> are

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
can see that on the roundabout there are

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.800 
can see that on the roundabout there are
five<00:01:40.200> lanes<00:01:40.680> now<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.700> can<00:01:41.880> see<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.180> lanes

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
five lanes now you can see that lanes

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.069 
five lanes now you can see that lanes
one<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.560> two<00:01:43.920> just<00:01:44.790> lead<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.329> first<00:01:45.600> exit

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
one and two just lead to the first exit

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.310 
one and two just lead to the first exit
Lane<00:01:47.009> number<00:01:47.310> three<00:01:47.880> goes<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.930> second

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
Lane number three goes to the second

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.550 
Lane number three goes to the second
exam<00:01:49.670> lane<00:01:50.670> four<00:01:51.180> goes<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.990> second<00:01:52.409> and

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
exam lane four goes to the second and

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.120 
exam lane four goes to the second and
third<00:01:52.979> exit<00:01:53.399> whenever<00:01:54.060> five<00:01:54.420> goes<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.439> Justin

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
third exit whenever five goes to Justin

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.030 
third exit whenever five goes to Justin
for<00:01:56.159> third<00:01:56.610> exit<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.960> reason<00:01:58.170> were<00:01:58.290> in<00:01:58.560> lane

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
for third exit the reason were in lane

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.370 
for third exit the reason were in lane
number<00:01:59.070> three<00:01:59.549> on<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.909> approach<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:01.229> make

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
number three on the approach is to make

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.859 
number three on the approach is to make
it<00:02:01.469> easier<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:02.250> get<00:02:02.460> into<00:02:02.759> lane<00:02:03.149> number<00:02:03.299> four

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
it easier to get into lane number four

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.660 
it easier to get into lane number four
and<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.590> will<00:02:04.770> make<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.009> easy<00:02:05.250> for<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.520> to

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
and that will make it easy for you to

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.110 
and that will make it easy for you to
leave<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.969> lot<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.390> later<00:02:06.630> on

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:08.120 
leave a lot of that later on

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.450 
leave a lot of that later on
if<00:02:09.120> you<00:02:09.540> maintain<00:02:09.990> your<00:02:10.110> speed<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.950> people<00:02:11.310> on

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
if you maintain your speed the people on

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.980 
if you maintain your speed the people on
either<00:02:11.670> side<00:02:12.060> will<00:02:12.270> tend<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.570> leave<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:12.930> alone

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
either side will tend to leave you alone

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.190 
either side will tend to leave you alone
but<00:02:13.830> a<00:02:14.130> word<00:02:14.460> of<00:02:14.610> warning<00:02:14.780> because<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.900> ranima

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
but a word of warning because the ranima

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.290 
but a word of warning because the ranima
is<00:02:16.380> actually<00:02:16.680> square<00:02:17.070> though<00:02:17.760> straight<00:02:18.150> lines

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
is actually square though straight lines

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.610 
is actually square though straight lines
and<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:19.050> catch<00:02:19.200> people<00:02:19.530> by<00:02:19.620> surprise<00:02:21.350> this<00:02:22.350> is

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
and to catch people by surprise this is

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.260 
and to catch people by surprise this is
a<00:02:22.710> good<00:02:23.160> place<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.460> start<00:02:23.670> checking<00:02:23.850> around

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
a good place to start checking around

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.450 
a good place to start checking around
and<00:02:24.510> giving<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.870> left<00:02:25.050> signal<00:02:25.350> now<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.830> know<00:02:25.920> it

and giving a left signal now I know it

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.520 
and giving a left signal now I know it
seems<00:02:26.790> early<00:02:27.090> but<00:02:27.600> we<00:02:27.750> need<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.110> get<00:02:28.350> ourselves

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
seems early but we need to get ourselves

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.160

up<00:02:40.710> early<00:02:41.010> but<00:02:41.820> because<00:02:42.240> again<00:02:42.870> this<00:02:43.140> lemma<00:02:43.620> is

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
anyway the very worst that will happen

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.070 
anyway the very worst that will happen
is<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:53.070> people<00:02:53.430> on<00:02:53.640> your<00:02:53.910> near<00:02:54.150> side<00:02:54.420> may<00:02:54.750> hold

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
is the people on your near side may hold

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.760 
is the people on your near side may hold
back<00:02:55.290> for<00:02:55.470> you

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770

if<00:02:56.100> they<00:02:56.280> do<00:02:56.520> that's<00:02:57.030> not<00:02:57.300> such<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:57.570> bad<00:02:57.840> thing

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
if they do that's not such a bad thing

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.900 
if they do that's not such a bad thing
because<00:03:01.050> now<00:03:01.470> it<00:03:01.620> means<00:03:01.830> we<00:03:02.250> are<00:03:02.520> in<00:03:02.700> that

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
because now it means we are in that

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.780 
because now it means we are in that
left-hand<00:03:03.510> Lane<00:03:03.750> in<00:03:04.020> plenty<00:03:04.680> of<00:03:04.770> time<00:03:05.070> for<00:03:05.100> our

exit and as we leave the roundabout you

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.360 
exit and as we leave the roundabout you
can<00:03:12.209> see<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.510> limit<00:03:12.810> goes<00:03:13.140> up<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.680> 50<00:03:14.160> miles

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
can see the limit goes up to 50 miles

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.820 
can see the limit goes up to 50 miles
per<00:03:14.459> hour<00:03:14.700> which<00:03:15.000> means<00:03:15.239> you<00:03:16.230> can<00:03:16.410> afford<00:03:16.470> to

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
per hour which means you can afford to

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.310 
per hour which means you can afford to
put<00:03:16.980> your<00:03:17.130> foot<00:03:17.370> down<00:03:17.610> and<00:03:18.080> impress<00:03:19.080> things

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
in the second clip here we're

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.140 
in the second clip here we're
approaching<00:03:33.440> again<00:03:33.920> from<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.460> leverage<00:03:34.880> road

approaching again from the leverage road

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.790 
approaching again from the leverage road
but<00:03:35.450> we're<00:03:35.810> taking<00:03:36.050> the<00:03:36.290> road<00:03:36.440> ahead<00:03:36.560> this

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
but we're taking the road ahead this

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.700 
but we're taking the road ahead this
time<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.340> second<00:03:37.760> exit<00:03:38.200> however<00:03:39.200> we're<00:03:39.680> still

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:39.710 
time the second exit however we're still

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.470 
time the second exit however we're still
approaching<00:03:40.460> from<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:40.760> right-hand<00:03:41.270> Lane

approaching from the right-hand Lane

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.199 
approaching from the right-hand Lane
simply<00:03:42.290> because<00:03:42.650> of<00:03:42.890> how<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:43.459> roundabout<00:03:44.000> is

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
simply because of how the roundabout is

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.760 
simply because of how the roundabout is
structured<00:03:44.690> as<00:03:46.360> the<00:03:47.360> lane<00:03:47.510> split<00:03:47.959> this<00:03:48.440> time

structured as the lane split this time
we'll<00:03:49.010> be<00:03:49.130> using<00:03:49.250> what<00:03:49.610> will<00:03:49.850> be<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.480> middle

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
we'll be using what will be the middle

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.140 
we'll be using what will be the middle
lane<00:03:50.990> which<00:03:51.709> will<00:03:51.890> then<00:03:52.130> correspond<00:03:52.910> with

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
lane which will then correspond with

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.940 
lane which will then correspond with
delay<00:03:53.420> number<00:03:53.690> three<00:03:53.990> force<00:03:54.320> the<00:03:54.590> middle<00:03:54.830> ink

delay number three force the middle ink

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:02.540 
delay number three force the middle ink

and<00:05:00.600> now<00:05:01.600> the<00:05:01.660> waterworks<00:05:02.350> runabout<00:05:02.800> is

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979

and now the waterworks runabout is
behind<00:05:03.370> you<00:05:03.669> which<00:05:03.910> means<00:05:04.180> you<00:05:04.330> can<00:05:04.450> afford<00:05:04.479> to

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
behind you which means you can afford to

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.540 
behind you which means you can afford to
relax<00:05:05.080> for<00:05:05.260> a<00:05:05.320> while<00:05:05.590> because<00:05:05.919> the<00:05:06.130> limit<00:05:06.400> is

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
relax for a while because the limit is

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:13.350 
relax for a while because the limit is
now<00:05:06.820> coming<00:05:07.120> back<00:05:07.240> down<00:05:07.510> to<00:05:07.720> 30<00:05:07.990> and<00:05:12.270> until<00:05:13.270> the
