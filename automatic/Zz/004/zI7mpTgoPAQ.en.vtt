00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
opens up a small singularity event right

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:05.190 
opens up a small singularity event right
it<00:02:02.830> was<00:02:03.039> black<00:02:03.340> hole<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:03.940> it'll<00:02:04.390> suck<00:02:04.750> zombies

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
into it in essentially we have these

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.789 
into it in essentially we have these
Landers<00:02:08.880> kind<00:02:09.880> of<00:02:09.910> like<00:02:10.200> space<00:02:11.200> Landers<00:02:11.590> so

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799 
Landers kind of like space Landers so

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.100 
Landers kind of like space Landers so
you<00:02:11.860> can<00:02:12.069> get<00:02:12.160> on<00:02:12.310> them<00:02:12.549> and<00:02:12.730> they'll<00:02:13.569> take<00:02:13.900> you

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
you can get on them and they'll take you

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
up on this Lander you'll take off you'll

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:23.940 
up on this Lander you'll take off you'll
fly<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.690> aerial<00:02:23.019> and<00:02:23.170> back<00:02:23.350> down<00:02:23.560> inside
