00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.650
 yes what business people have come to my official old buildings Nano 6 the 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.050
 Problems Julia the iPod Nano sixth generation has not only 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.309
 technically but also visually changed a lot I've got her again 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.480
 Compared to the iPod Nano compares the first hour 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.980
 and there you see 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.650
 A lot has happened in this six generation 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.280
 good then catch but also come to the same time with a Pott Nano 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.070
 six Gabriel Mio is the Zeil WiGig "super super" small animal 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.940
 she pull my palm 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.460
 it's totally easy on the back one click 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.680
 Here you see the clip 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.390
 and has quieter Bartens here 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.700
 Suri here 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.260
 the on and off similarly made infinite of the processing as in the case of 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.470
 iPhone 4 of course everything is a little smaller 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.070
 when we turn on the iPod Nano 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.150
 then we have it right once 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.680
 the title we are listening to 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.140
 and we can go directly to the main menu Slaiten disagree title menu 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.010
 when they go to the main menu 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.330
 Dante greets us the typical 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.909
 AP view 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.830
 as we already know from the iPod Touch and of course from the iPhone 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.010
 and iPad 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.750
 that's all Gazelles again, however, is not possible 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.600
 to charge any App Store on the iPod Nano 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.690
 of course he does not have a lawyer 4 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.220
 supports 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.920
 yes, here we start by looking at different ones 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.770
 AP specifically first with the lists 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:39.979
 artists 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.770
 awesome percent her higher values ​​Jeannie it is now possible 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.120
 also with the new iPod Nano 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.600
 Of course the rest has always been there 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.120
 go over dirt in the main menu go to a radio is installed that sees 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:56.420
 maybe here 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.170
 and you can look at it with photos 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.240
 then of course you can listen to Pott guest 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.670
 and the setting also in the typical 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.380
 ICANN view 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.280
 «Here, so to speak, that is so that victory must be more tired once we have the 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.619
 Title the albums 

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:15.989
 Composers and conjured Eick Ernst 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.310
 and then there is one last service 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.450
 a last bunch is fitness 

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:25.179
 because the iPod Nano if we go over here now 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.990
 does not support any special sponsored by Maliki the whole so to speak 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.609
 Kendo meter is called the whole country 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.199
 and you have a bad egg on it now 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:40.780
 and then I'll show you the simulated ones just a little bit 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.939
 we are pushing her court 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:46.969
 and now we can simulate our steps in the world here 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:48.080
 just times 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.749
 do the following 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:51.949
 and so 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:54.119
 then look here already 

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:57.569
 I did that until seven steps 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.470
 I do not know how exactly this is 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.220
 Indeed 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.410
 The Saul for Athletes Definitely Bennett is next to feature 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.739
 we go back again 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.939
 how can you call them over view 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.939
 there we can now retrieve our various data 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.909
 that too is a very much participated 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.590
 now her mandate back and so was jur to the clock 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.010
 There will also be a preparation that we can give more, namely you can 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.219
 Just use it more and more as something completely different 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:30.489
 she draws like this 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.589
 Viennese wristwatch in principle 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:35.629
 and that's why there is now also extra video 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.909
 however, you can use this dial 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:42.269
 in black or in white you can set this in the settings 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.400
 and again this is a very rare tel one thing 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:51.979
 he is already sown optically everything is kept very small 

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:55.359
 Of course, touchscreen is super sophisticated as always 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:00.509
 and you can write that day he also needs two 4 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:03.079
 and you just have to 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.150
 with these two fingers pointed out the falls so imagined 

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:08.090
 once here 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.499
 just turn around 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.989
 that could make a 60 degrees in three 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.439
 and then come back sometime 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:16.660
 was starting position on 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.939
 Now let's take a quick look at the lists 

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:23.189
 and of course give it for the title minim 

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:27.159
 here are our albums and this is the typical albums view 

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:29.090
 like us 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.499
 and percent yes 

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:35.709
 You can also just as easily through this already in the top game in the small 

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:36.949
 but fall 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:40.349
 You can also do that very easily by scrolling 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:44.509
 yes the iPod Nano supports in contrast 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:49.849
 his predecessor no camera says no more camera on the 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:50.639
 back 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.990
 that would probably have been a bit too much of a good thing 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.949
 Blair is the size of an ink further development of the iPod 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:02.919
 I've already said in boxing but that's why it was sewing thread I'm fine 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:07.310
 me more and me ourselves and that is just way light 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.749
 effective 

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:11.749
 another feature is the radio 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:14.650
 Of course, it is also included 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.500
 And indeed, the current hall has no signal 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.499
 I have not used it yet 

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:22.499
 but it is nice if you eat on the way 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:28.279
 just a simple example to call football you can also radio- 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:29.670
 Record the program 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.919
 how then continue or then one 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.360
 yes so contains fixed as a hard disk recorder too 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.379
 to save forever that means one can think I save twenty minutes 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:43.740
 you do not miss so many that it's like a small hard drive recorder 

00:05:43.739 --> 00:05:44.699
 for the radio 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:47.349
 especially when you're on the road and doing sports 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:49.370
 very much mead 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.460
 the photos 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.460
 are not there yet but is 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.460
 again typical as the iPhone made the whole 

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:00.369
 that is in principle already with me 

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:06.759
 it was made quite a bit and the ipod nano 6 is for that for what 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:07.839
 he thought 

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:09.729
 a right 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:14.120
 to say a real folks lumberjack because he is small 

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:16.460
 he is easy to use 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.449
 and especially for athletes 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:21.260
 People who do not want to carry so much with them now 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.550
 he is definitely ideal 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.780
 come in different colors I have it here in blue you see it 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:29.520
 Of course, there are also other colors 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.580
 and the one I have here now has 8 like work 

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:36.680
 and costs about one hundred 60 euros 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.180
 you can then also engrave 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.339
 and the off 

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:44.349
 As I said the clip to very, very good, you can really over the 

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:47.349
 Cliffs as well as the already know 

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:51.099
 it just for the sport a nice she said 

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:53.310
 the whole 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:58.129
 In any case, this will get a very high court order from Enn King 

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:01.819
 because I thought it Wittlich for the second for the thought that bought 

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:02.410
 to have 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.740
 I can understand, though, that many people say it's too bad 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.319
 that no video now 

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:11.710
 Play or that you can not take pictures anymore which is a pity 

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:13.899
 I give that too 

00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:15.279
 "That would be natural 

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:18.279
 to Doberan have been times if you are here with even now 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.340
 Taking pictures could be the proud part of it 

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:27.279
 which is also Netgear, but I have not tested that yet 

00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:29.240
 There will also be an extra video for that 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.389
 is that you can raise a buggy 

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:34.909
 because I discovered by chance I still have not seen my own but me 

00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:38.369
 Definitely try the completely normal report 

00:07:38.369 --> 00:07:41.809
 but from the basic functions what the video of this I hope, of course 

00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:43.740
 had fallen through Schiemer 

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.449
 when the Bima think of it, thumbs up and mine 

00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:48.509
 nice optimize 

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:50.499
 and with that I say peace 

00:07:50.499 --> 00:07:51.930
 until the next video
