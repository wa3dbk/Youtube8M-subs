inspiration from the Nexus 7 primarily
looking<00:01:36.509> at<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.780> shield<00:01:37.140> logo<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.979> back

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
looking at the shield logo on the back

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.130 
looking at the shield logo on the back
because<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.150> landscape<00:01:39.420> mode<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.930> I

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
because it is in landscape mode and I

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.660 
because it is in landscape mode and I
really<00:01:40.530> think<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.950> wonderful<00:01:41.460> look

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
really think this is a wonderful look

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.399 
really think this is a wonderful look
with<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> soft<00:01:42.390> touch<00:01:42.600> plastic<00:01:43.020> on<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.229> back

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
with the soft touch plastic on the back

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.080 
with the soft touch plastic on the back
that<00:01:43.619> does<00:01:43.860> get<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> little<00:01:44.310> bit<00:01:44.430> smudged<00:01:44.820> but

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
that does get a little bit smudged but

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.300 
that does get a little bit smudged but
it's<00:01:45.329> not<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.899> unattractive<00:01:46.380> when<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.280> a

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
it's not that unattractive when it is a

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.039 
it's not that unattractive when it is a
little<00:01:47.640> bit<00:01:47.759> dirty<00:01:47.909> thankfully<00:01:48.630> when

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
little bit dirty thankfully when

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.649 
little bit dirty thankfully when
compared<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.530> glossy<00:01:50.040> plastic<00:01:50.250> as<00:01:51.030> far<00:01:51.240> as<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
compared to glossy plastic as far as the

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.620 
compared to glossy plastic as far as the
weight<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.439> actual<00:01:53.009> device<00:01:53.369> goes<00:01:53.729> there

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
weight of the actual device goes there

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.350 
weight of the actual device goes there
is<00:01:54.780> definitely<00:01:55.380> some<00:01:55.590> heft<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.070> this<00:01:56.490> tablet

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
is definitely some heft to this tablet

is definitely some heft to this tablet

screen it's not that unattractive we
would<00:02:02.520> definitely<00:02:03.360> prefer<00:02:03.630> smaller<00:02:04.259> bezels

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
would definitely prefer smaller bezels

would definitely prefer smaller bezels
all<00:02:04.829> around<00:02:05.100> but<00:02:05.250> it's<00:02:05.399> not<00:02:05.610> necessarily<00:02:06.149> that

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
all around but it's not necessarily that

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.940 
all around but it's not necessarily that
big<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.719> deal<00:02:06.930> especially<00:02:07.500> when<00:02:07.860> you

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
big of a deal especially when you

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.229 
big of a deal especially when you
consider<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.340> there<00:02:08.610> are<00:02:08.729> front-facing

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239

for some of the sound leaking to come
out<00:02:22.710> also<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.520> really<00:02:23.730> provide<00:02:24.120> for<00:02:24.150> a

out also to really provide for a

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.590 
out also to really provide for a
immersive<00:02:25.380> experience<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.420> stylus<00:02:27.420> is

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
immersive experience a stylus is

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.270 
immersive experience a stylus is
actually<00:02:27.990> available<00:02:28.200> as<00:02:28.530> well<00:02:28.770> on<00:02:28.980> here<00:02:29.130> and

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
actually available as well on here and

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.699 
actually available as well on here and
the<00:02:29.370> stylus<00:02:29.730> is<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:30.420> bit<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.959> peculiar<00:02:31.380> thing

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
the stylus is a bit of a peculiar thing

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.310 
the stylus is a bit of a peculiar thing
because<00:02:32.040> while<00:02:32.520> it<00:02:32.790> is<00:02:33.060> nestled<00:02:33.630> nicely<00:02:34.170> on

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
because while it is nestled nicely on

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.010 
because while it is nestled nicely on
the<00:02:34.470> top<00:02:34.709> right<00:02:35.070> of<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.490> tablet<00:02:36.450> when<00:02:36.870> you

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
the top right of the tablet when you

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.480 
the top right of the tablet when you
take<00:02:37.380> it<00:02:37.500> out<00:02:37.650> you'll<00:02:37.830> notice<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.280> tip

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
take it out you'll notice that the tip

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.000 
take it out you'll notice that the tip
is<00:02:38.520> not<00:02:38.640> just<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.150> rounded<00:02:39.930> tip<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.410> has<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.800> bit

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
is not just a rounded tip it has a bit

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.550 
is not just a rounded tip it has a bit
of<00:02:41.100> a<00:02:41.190> brush<00:02:41.660> designed<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:42.990> that<00:02:43.290> does<00:02:43.440> make

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
of a brush designed to it that does make

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.199 
of a brush designed to it that does make
it<00:02:43.740> quite<00:02:43.920> pleasant<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.370> use<00:02:44.670> it's<00:02:44.970> a<00:02:45.030> little

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
it quite pleasant to use it's a little

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.520 
it quite pleasant to use it's a little
bit<00:02:45.300> different<00:02:45.600> from<00:02:45.660> other<00:02:45.870> styluses<00:02:46.320> out

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
bit different from other styluses out

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.050 
bit different from other styluses out
there<00:02:46.709> but<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.160> reason<00:02:47.400> why<00:02:47.489> that<00:02:47.640> brush<00:02:47.880> is

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
there but the reason why that brush is

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.430 
there but the reason why that brush is
there<00:02:48.239> is<00:02:48.390> if<00:02:48.660> you're<00:02:48.840> going<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.170> use<00:02:49.290> the

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
there is if you're going to use the

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.160 
there is if you're going to use the
Nvidia<00:02:49.860> dabbler<00:02:50.900> application<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:52.050> will

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
Nvidia dabbler application that will

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.229 
Nvidia dabbler application that will
allow<00:02:52.350> you<00:02:52.410> to<00:02:52.530> draw<00:02:52.980> on<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.520> fly<00:02:53.820> but<00:02:54.090> the

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
allow you to draw on the fly but the

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.790 
allow you to draw on the fly but the
stylus<00:02:54.630> for<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.840> most<00:02:55.020> part<00:02:55.260> works<00:02:55.500> about<00:02:55.739> a

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
stylus for the most part works about a

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.979 
stylus for the most part works about a
standard<00:02:56.310> as<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.580> would<00:02:56.700> expect<00:02:56.790> it<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.780> it

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
standard as you would expect it and it

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.900 
standard as you would expect it and it
is<00:02:58.110> pretty<00:02:58.320> comfortable<00:02:58.560> in<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:58.920> hand<00:02:59.070> along

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
is pretty comfortable in the hand along

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.060 
is pretty comfortable in the hand along
that<00:03:00.180> same<00:03:00.450> area<00:03:00.690> where<00:03:00.989> you<00:03:01.110> have<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.590> stylus

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
that same area where you have the stylus

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.610 
that same area where you have the stylus
is<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:03.239> button<00:03:03.540> layouts<00:03:03.930> with<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.380> power

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
is the button layouts with the power

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.620 
is the button layouts with the power
button<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.430> volume<00:03:05.580> rockers<00:03:06.090> I<00:03:06.209> do<00:03:06.270> feel

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
button and the volume rockers I do feel

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.780 
button and the volume rockers I do feel
that<00:03:06.660> they<00:03:06.989> are<00:03:07.200> a<00:03:07.230> little<00:03:07.620> bit<00:03:07.800> squishy<00:03:08.220> but

Android games with a peripheral that had

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
a controller built in but this time they

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.930 
especially after we get that controller
because<00:04:49.740> it<00:04:49.830> is<00:04:49.980> what<00:04:50.190> is<00:04:50.310> needed<00:04:50.580> in<00:04:50.820> order

good<00:05:15.990> job<00:05:16.050> of<00:05:16.470> keeping<00:05:16.590> the<00:05:16.830> immersed<00:05:17.220> into

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
good job of keeping the immersed into

good job of keeping the immersed into
the<00:05:17.550> media<00:05:17.970> I<00:05:18.240> really<00:05:19.230> felt<00:05:19.470> like<00:05:19.530> once<00:05:20.130> I<00:05:20.250> got

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
the media I really felt like once I got

the media I really felt like once I got
into<00:05:20.640> the<00:05:20.790> episodes<00:05:21.240> I<00:05:21.450> had<00:05:21.600> no<00:05:21.840> reason<00:05:22.230> I

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
into the episodes I had no reason I

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.840 
into the episodes I had no reason I
could<00:05:22.500> find<00:05:22.710> no<00:05:22.830> reason<00:05:23.190> to<00:05:23.310> really<00:05:23.490> turn<00:05:23.700> it

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
could find no reason to really turn it

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.550 
could find no reason to really turn it
off<00:05:24.000> and<00:05:24.270> look<00:05:24.540> for<00:05:24.780> a<00:05:24.990> different<00:05:25.110> way<00:05:25.530> of

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
off and look for a different way of

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.440 
off and look for a different way of
watching<00:05:25.980> those<00:05:26.100> episodes<00:05:26.370> I<00:05:26.730> was<00:05:27.060> able<00:05:27.150> to<00:05:27.270> go

watching those episodes I was able to go

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.180 
watching those episodes I was able to go
through<00:05:27.810> about<00:05:27.990> a<00:05:28.380> quarter<00:05:28.710> of<00:05:28.740> a<00:05:28.860> season

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190
