whatever<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:43.489> know<00:00:44.489> about<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.910> but<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.180> first

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
whatever I know about you but the first

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.750 
whatever I know about you but the first
time<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.719> saw<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> 360<00:00:46.649> flip<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:47.070> was<00:00:47.309> pretty<00:00:47.610> blown

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
time I saw a 360 flip I was pretty blown

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.209 
time I saw a 360 flip I was pretty blown
away<00:00:47.989> physics<00:00:48.989> didn't<00:00:49.530> make<00:00:49.680> sense<00:00:49.950> I

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
away physics didn't make sense I

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.619 
away physics didn't make sense I
definitely<00:00:50.730> didn't<00:00:50.879> take<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.120> class<00:00:51.390> yet

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
definitely didn't take that class yet

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.500 
definitely didn't take that class yet
but<00:00:52.559> what's<00:00:52.860> really<00:00:53.280> going<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.760> 360<00:00:54.239> flip

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
but what's really going on in 360 flip

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.090 
but what's really going on in 360 flip
is<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.780> your<00:00:54.870> board<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.170> doing<00:00:55.350> one<00:00:55.620> kickflip

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
is that your board is doing one kickflip

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.330 
is that your board is doing one kickflip
and<00:00:56.340> it's<00:00:57.059> gonna<00:00:57.149> be<00:00:57.329> spinning<00:00:57.980> 360<00:00:58.980> degrees

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
and it's gonna be spinning 360 degrees

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.860 
and it's gonna be spinning 360 degrees
so<00:00:59.640> we'll<00:00:59.940> be<00:01:00.059> landing<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.390> same<00:01:00.600> way<00:01:00.809> you

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
so we'll be landing the same way you

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.020 
so we'll be landing the same way you
know<00:01:01.109> he<00:01:01.260> started<00:01:01.620> since<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.609> trick<00:01:02.820> has<00:01:02.850> a

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
kickflip in it you want to make sure you

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.140 
kickflip in it you want to make sure you

like your kickflip but just a little bit
farther<00:01:50.549> back<00:01:50.700> these<00:01:51.689> flip<00:01:51.899> positions<00:01:52.290> might

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
farther back these flip positions might

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.980 
farther back these flip positions might
sound<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.890> little<00:01:52.920> weird<00:01:53.280> but<00:01:53.810> once<00:01:54.810> you're

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
sound a little weird but once you're

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.899 
sound a little weird but once you're
actually<00:01:55.079> on<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.740> set<00:01:55.920> up<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.610> not<00:01:56.729> so

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
actually on it and set up it's not so

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.870 
actually on it and set up it's not so
bad

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.889 

so<00:02:00.880> when<00:02:00.999> you're<00:02:01.149> set<00:02:01.329> up<00:02:01.359> and<00:02:01.630> you're<00:02:01.749> ready

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
so when you're set up and you're ready

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.109 
so when you're set up and you're ready
to<00:02:02.020> pop<00:02:02.289> yeah<00:02:02.859> I<00:02:02.890> remember<00:02:03.039> the<00:02:03.340> 360<00:02:03.819> flip<00:02:03.880> is

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
to pop yeah I remember the 360 flip is

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.940 
to pop yeah I remember the 360 flip is
not<00:02:04.329> like<00:02:04.539> your<00:02:04.719> kickflip<00:02:05.140> so<00:02:05.710> you're<00:02:05.859> not

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
not like your kickflip so you're not

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.100 
not like your kickflip so you're not
going<00:02:06.130> to<00:02:06.219> be<00:02:06.280> popping<00:02:06.640> straight<00:02:07.450> up<00:02:07.569> and<00:02:07.750> down

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
going to be popping straight up and down

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.229 
going to be popping straight up and down
you're<00:02:08.769> actually<00:02:09.129> to<00:02:09.190> be<00:02:09.310> doing<00:02:09.670> a<00:02:09.729> more<00:02:09.910> scoop

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
you're actually to be doing a more scoop

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:11.610 
you're actually to be doing a more scoop
motion<00:02:10.629> with<00:02:10.720> your<00:02:10.840> back<00:02:10.989> foot<00:02:11.230> so<00:02:11.500> you're

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
motion with your back foot so you're

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.710 
motion with your back foot so you're
going<00:02:11.739> to<00:02:11.769> be<00:02:11.860> kicking<00:02:12.069> it<00:02:12.250> out<00:02:12.340> like<00:02:12.549> this

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.220 

scoop

[Music]

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.780 

to<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.140> front<00:02:26.410> foot<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:26.920> like<00:02:27.340> I<00:02:27.430> was<00:02:27.580> saying

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
to the front foot and like I was saying

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.400 
to the front foot and like I was saying
earlier<00:02:27.880> it's<00:02:28.510> similar<00:02:28.900> to<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:29.080> kick<00:02:29.230> foot

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
earlier it's similar to the kick foot

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.960 
earlier it's similar to the kick foot
position<00:02:29.800> but<00:02:30.220> we're<00:02:30.340> not<00:02:30.430> gonna<00:02:30.550> be<00:02:30.670> doing<00:02:30.730> a

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
position but we're not gonna be doing a

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.670 
position but we're not gonna be doing a
kickflip<00:02:31.390> because<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.840> cakepop<00:02:32.140> goes<00:02:32.319> out<00:02:32.500> in

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
kickflip because the cakepop goes out in

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.949 
kickflip because the cakepop goes out in
front<00:02:32.920> of<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.390> 360<00:02:34.390> flip<00:02:34.599> like<00:02:34.690> I<00:02:34.810> was

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
front of you and 360 flip like I was

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.240 
front of you and 360 flip like I was
saying<00:02:35.170> there's<00:02:35.349> more<00:02:35.500> of<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.620> scissor<00:02:35.830> kick<00:02:35.950> so

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
saying there's more of a scissor kick so

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.620 
saying there's more of a scissor kick so
it's<00:02:36.370> going<00:02:36.489> to<00:02:36.550> be<00:02:36.670> going<00:02:36.760> out<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.420> side

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
it's going to be going out to the side

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.970 
it's going to be going out to the side
of<00:02:37.750> you<00:02:37.870> because<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.319> want<00:02:38.470> your<00:02:38.560> foot<00:02:38.770> out<00:02:38.950> of

the<00:02:53.380> board<00:02:53.620> is<00:02:53.680> gonna<00:02:53.769> spin<00:02:54.130> I<00:02:54.310> mean<00:02:54.580> that's

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
the board is gonna spin I mean that's

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.610 
the board is gonna spin I mean that's
what<00:02:55.000> I<00:02:55.060> did<00:02:57.870> so<00:02:58.870> once<00:02:59.019> you<00:02:59.110> got<00:02:59.230> your<00:02:59.410> board

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
what I did so once you got your board

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.350 
what I did so once you got your board
spinning<00:03:00.040> out<00:03:00.190> of<00:03:00.220> your<00:03:00.400> system<00:03:00.819> it's<00:03:01.030> time<00:03:01.239> to

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
spinning out of your system it's time to

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.970 
spinning out of your system it's time to
keep<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.600> board<00:03:01.780> underneath<00:03:02.110> you<00:03:02.380> and<00:03:02.590> the

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
keep the board underneath you and the

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.320 
keep the board underneath you and the
way<00:03:03.069> we're<00:03:03.220> gonna<00:03:03.280> do<00:03:03.580> this<00:03:03.610> is<00:03:03.880> like<00:03:04.000> I<00:03:04.180> was

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
way we're gonna do this is like I was

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.940 
way we're gonna do this is like I was
saying<00:03:04.600> with<00:03:04.780> your<00:03:04.930> scissor<00:03:05.170> kick<00:03:05.440> with

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
saying with your scissor kick with

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.320 
saying with your scissor kick with
keeping<00:03:06.250> your<00:03:06.400> front<00:03:06.549> foot<00:03:06.760> out<00:03:06.970> of<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.209> way

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
keeping your front foot out of the way

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.780 
keeping your front foot out of the way
and<00:03:07.569> well<00:03:07.750> jumping<00:03:08.380> and<00:03:08.560> so<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.459> best<00:03:09.580> way<00:03:09.760> to

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
and well jumping and so the best way to

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.630 
and well jumping and so the best way to
approach<00:03:10.450> this<00:03:10.510> is<00:03:11.019> to<00:03:11.500> land<00:03:12.250> it<00:03:12.370> with<00:03:12.489> one

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
approach this is to land it with one

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.479 
approach this is to land it with one
foot

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
foot

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.559 
foot
so<00:03:15.489> once<00:03:15.640> you've<00:03:15.760> mastered<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.540> whole

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
so once you've mastered the whole

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.180 
so once you've mastered the whole
spinning<00:03:17.200> keeping<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.739> board<00:03:17.950> underneath

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
spinning keeping the board underneath

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.830 
spinning keeping the board underneath
you<00:03:18.459> and<00:03:18.610> landing<00:03:19.000> it<00:03:19.150> with<00:03:19.299> your<00:03:19.450> front<00:03:19.660> foot
