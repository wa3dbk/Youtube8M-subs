makes<00:01:59.369> me<00:01:59.579> think<00:01:59.880> that<00:01:59.909> Ricardo<00:02:00.509> will<00:02:00.719> turn<00:02:00.990> on

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
I've said in previous videos it's time

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.780 
I've said in previous videos it's time
that<00:04:49.960> do<00:04:50.229> unify<00:04:50.680> that<00:04:50.710> thing<00:04:51.070> I<00:04:51.190> hoping<00:04:51.400> there

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
that do unify that thing I hoping there

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.020 
that do unify that thing I hoping there
is<00:04:51.910> a<00:04:51.940> title<00:04:52.270> unification<00:04:52.510> at<00:04:53.199> WrestleMania

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
is a title unification at WrestleMania

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.670 
is a title unification at WrestleMania
otherwise<00:04:55.030> you<00:04:55.419> know<00:04:55.570> look<00:04:56.050> you<00:04:56.199> got<00:04:56.350> so<00:04:56.560> many

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
otherwise you know look you got so many

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.379 
otherwise you know look you got so many
guys<00:04:56.919> who<00:04:56.950> are<00:04:57.280> undeserving<00:04:57.580> of<00:04:58.030> being<00:04:58.240> world

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
guys who are undeserving of being world

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.560 
guys who are undeserving of being world
champions<00:04:58.900> being<00:04:59.169> a<00:04:59.410> world<00:04:59.650> champion<00:04:59.740> I<00:05:00.190> think

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
champions being a world champion I think

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.180 
champions being a world champion I think
it<00:05:01.570> would<00:05:01.720> make<00:05:01.870> the<00:05:02.020> WB<00:05:02.410> championship<00:05:02.860> so

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
it would make the WB championship so

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.219 
it would make the WB championship so
prestigious<00:05:03.639> if<00:05:04.090> they<00:05:04.240> just<00:05:04.510> if<00:05:04.840> it<00:05:05.110> was

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
prestigious if they just if it was

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:06.870 
prestigious if they just if it was
unified<00:05:05.620> because<00:05:05.770> only<00:05:06.100> one<00:05:06.310> person<00:05:06.790> would

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
unified because only one person would

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.659 
unified because only one person would
get<00:05:07.120> it<00:05:07.240> there<00:05:08.229> would<00:05:08.350> be<00:05:08.380> two<00:05:08.710> champions<00:05:09.190> and

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
get it there would be two champions and

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:11.610 
get it there would be two champions and
there<00:05:10.300> wouldn't<00:05:10.540> be<00:05:10.570> an<00:05:10.720> upper<00:05:11.169> mid<00:05:11.350> card

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
there wouldn't be an upper mid card

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.260 
there wouldn't be an upper mid card
champion<00:05:12.160> as<00:05:12.310> the<00:05:12.430> world<00:05:12.610> champion<00:05:13.090> they'd

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
champion as the world champion they'd

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.020 
champion as the world champion they'd
have<00:05:13.450> just<00:05:13.930> main<00:05:14.139> event<00:05:14.470> guys<00:05:14.680> only<00:05:15.190> and<00:05:15.400> I

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
have just main event guys only and I

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.370 
have just main event guys only and I
think<00:05:16.210> would<00:05:16.330> certainly<00:05:16.600> up<00:05:16.840> the<00:05:16.990> value<00:05:17.320> of

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
think would certainly up the value of

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.930 
think would certainly up the value of
the<00:05:17.440> WB<00:05:17.830> champion<00:05:18.220> is<00:05:18.370> certainly<00:05:18.610> up<00:05:18.760> the

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
the WB champion is certainly up the

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.450 
the WB champion is certainly up the
value<00:05:19.330> and<00:05:19.660> make<00:05:20.560> it<00:05:20.680> much<00:05:20.830> more<00:05:21.010> of<00:05:21.100> a<00:05:21.160> drawing

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
value and make it much more of a drawing

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.090 
value and make it much more of a drawing
card<00:05:21.820> in<00:05:22.000> my<00:05:22.090> opinion<00:05:22.570> and<00:05:23.560> it<00:05:23.680> would<00:05:23.770> be<00:05:23.889> it'd

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100
