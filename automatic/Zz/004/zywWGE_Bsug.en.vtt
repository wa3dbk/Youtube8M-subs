00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.180
 Now my whole name will be double 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.540
 chevron and so on is now a part of the 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.550
 control in tf1 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.969
 to begin we will see how to generate a 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.550
 new and like loads before so that 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.460
 You can see me here I have a 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.230
 folder in both my before and we're going to go 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.689
 loading here what we have is 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.489
 the road will simply be pressed 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.349
 we keep tight and let's go 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:27.740
 pressing the different buttons and what 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.800
 I will be loading 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.689
 in the courtyards this closed and really 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.629
 the official sound list will come out 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:44.350
 10 that is here simply button is 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:47.180
 simple to do is press the button if 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.960
 we click on the wheel and how can 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:56.589
 see something to save names 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:01:00.049
 as simply by way of example now 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:02.750
 we are positioned 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:05.750
 to spend what we say is to keep 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.460
 tight if we turn the knee and want 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:12.380
 a little wheel marks me that I will be in 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:14.869
 the reverse in the part ay already directly 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.460
 I have control of this setback that are 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.299
 indicates 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.860
 you can see that there are different 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:24.430
 are with an arrow that has a 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.430
 kind of circle 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:33.150
 that are with the arrow in the piece 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:37.320
 what do I do as I reproduce the 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.830
 sound and when I finish the sampler goes 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.830
 to stop 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.860
 do not 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.430
 well if I want this also what 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.820
 I have to do is learn to guys style 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.850
 and obviously position it says pl 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.350
 playback mod you can see that the 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.540
 that are in green are what is in the 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.610
 loop and I hope that this language that 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.360
 we had a single shot 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.700
 we change it 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.490
 and there you can see 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.070
 that change and being 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.290
 another thing I want to explain today is if 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.960
 we would like to change the volume 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.440
 of a sampler what we are going to do is 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:24.450
 this is going to play one 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.490
 the truth is necessary you can see very 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.710
 what I'm going to do is try to 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.320
 to increase volume what is done is going 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.910
 until the maximum one presses shift 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.290
 We work to see that it does not vary 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.670
 the volume but we will have much more 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.670
 rest to be able to go back up 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.159
 did not vary volume but now I have more 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.159
 straight 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.700
 if I wanted to download it what I have to 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:59.810
 to do is the opposite is to upload a 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.810
 little affect the maximum volume 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:10.190
 affects if your volume directory 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:11.920
 will wait more this is what allows 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.400
 good 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.519
 so that you 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.569
 these buttons that are what it does 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.360
 obviously iris do everything synchronized 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.850
 same if we are here what the 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.220
 quotation 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.400
 we can choose how many 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.220
 bits out every sound taken out that I squeezed 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.220
 a couple of every 2,000 will come out the dream 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.860
 you put 4 Each 4 and so 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.540
 successively 68 that is nothing I 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:44.400
 it was convenient to handle it each one 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.400
 so that for example site here 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.720
 yes 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.730
 I changed a more real control of what 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.209
 is the situation when it comes to modifying 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.860
 the sounds basically sectorial good 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.530
 It would be a trick that is a trick 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:05.100
 what is called b style is that if we 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.760
 in your masters the freezer to tighten the 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.380
 button and rivers 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.670
 we plug in 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.960
 and do this kind of lighting that 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.410
 well basically this was all 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.410
 obviously
