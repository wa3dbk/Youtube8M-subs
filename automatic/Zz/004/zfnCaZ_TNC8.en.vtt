00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
exactly what I'd call out easily but

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.240 
exactly what I'd call out easily but
Berwyn<00:03:30.870> it's<00:03:31.870> a<00:03:31.930> pretty<00:03:32.109> light<00:03:32.379> color<00:03:32.409> a<00:03:32.889> lot

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.580 
of these colors look really similar on
camera<00:03:36.220> I'm<00:03:36.370> sure<00:03:36.669> Oh<00:03:37.200> what<00:03:38.200> is<00:03:38.439> this

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
camera I'm sure Oh what is this

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.809 
camera I'm sure Oh what is this
it's<00:03:41.590> a<00:03:42.010> Hitachi<00:03:42.750> but<00:03:43.750> ty<00:03:44.049> the<00:03:44.829> color<00:03:45.219> ring<00:03:45.579> is

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819

it's a Hitachi but ty the color ring is
not<00:03:46.090> on<00:03:46.389> this<00:03:46.689> so<00:03:48.930> that's<00:03:49.930> a<00:03:50.139> bit<00:03:50.260> of<00:03:50.290> a<00:03:50.439> mystery

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
not on this so that's a bit of a mystery

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.199 
not on this so that's a bit of a mystery
I<00:03:50.889> guess<00:03:51.010> we're<00:03:51.430> gonna<00:03:51.489> have<00:03:51.639> to<00:03:51.760> figure<00:03:52.060> out

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209
