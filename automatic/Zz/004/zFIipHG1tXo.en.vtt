on footings and other types of
installations<00:00:56.109> where<00:00:57.100> where<00:00:57.579> you<00:00:57.699> need<00:00:57.879> to

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
installations where where you need to

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.930 
installations where where you need to
bend<00:00:58.149> rebar<00:00:58.600> and<00:00:59.469> oftentimes<00:00:59.859> you<00:01:00.550> may<00:01:00.699> find

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
bend rebar and oftentimes you may find

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.880 
bend rebar and oftentimes you may find
that<00:01:01.059> you've<00:01:01.300> got<00:01:01.449> the<00:01:01.600> rebar<00:01:01.960> already<00:01:02.559> coming

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
that you've got the rebar already coming

out of the ground or out of out of

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.990 
out of the ground or out of out of
concrete<00:01:05.530> and<00:01:05.710> you<00:01:06.100> have<00:01:06.280> to<00:01:06.400> make<00:01:06.550> a<00:01:06.580> bend<00:01:06.909> to

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
concrete and you have to make a bend to

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.620 
concrete and you have to make a bend to
it<00:01:07.120> so<00:01:07.840> we<00:01:07.990> designed<00:01:08.410> this<00:01:08.560> product<00:01:08.890> a<00:01:09.160> DBC<00:01:09.700> 16h

this is an electric hydraulic tool for
doing<00:01:34.870> both<00:01:35.080> the<00:01:35.260> cutting<00:01:35.590> and<00:01:35.830> bending<00:01:36.280> so<00:01:36.730> to

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
doing both the cutting and bending so to

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.130 
doing both the cutting and bending so to
demonstrate<00:01:37.030> this<00:01:37.450> let's<00:01:37.840> put<00:01:37.990> on<00:01:38.110> some

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
demonstrate this let's put on some

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.090 
demonstrate this let's put on some
safety<00:01:38.530> glasses<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:41.200> I'm<00:01:41.350> going<00:01:41.560> to<00:01:41.650> use<00:01:41.890> this

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
safety glasses and I'm going to use this

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.000 
safety glasses and I'm going to use this
number<00:01:42.490> five<00:01:42.960> rebar<00:01:43.960> which<00:01:44.200> is<00:01:44.380> 5/8<00:01:44.830> in

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
number five rebar which is 5/8 in

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.660 
number five rebar which is 5/8 in
diameter<00:01:45.790> 5/8<00:01:46.480> of<00:01:46.570> an<00:01:46.690> inch<00:01:46.810> in<00:01:46.990> diameter<00:01:47.140> and

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
diameter 5/8 of an inch in diameter and

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.880 
diameter 5/8 of an inch in diameter and
we're<00:01:48.670> just<00:01:48.850> going<00:01:49.000> to<00:01:49.030> put<00:01:49.270> a<00:01:49.350> 135<00:01:50.350> degree

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
we're just going to put a 135 degree

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.359 
we're just going to put a 135 degree
hook<00:01:51.100> on

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.620 

so<00:01:58.369> you<00:01:58.460> can<00:01:58.610> just<00:01:58.759> bend<00:01:58.970> that<00:01:59.119> right<00:01:59.299> around

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
so you can just bend that right around

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.760 
so you can just bend that right around
and<00:02:00.310> then<00:02:01.310> if<00:02:02.210> say<00:02:02.720> I<00:02:02.750> was<00:02:02.990> making<00:02:03.170> a<00:02:03.409> stirrup

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
and then if say I was making a stirrup

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:12.510 
and then if say I was making a stirrup
and<00:02:03.890> I<00:02:03.979> needed<00:02:04.189> to<00:02:04.310> put<00:02:04.580> 90-degree<00:02:05.180> bends<00:02:05.570> on

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.100 

now<00:02:13.520> if<00:02:13.670> I<00:02:13.760> want<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.060> cut<00:02:14.660> with<00:02:14.930> this

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
now if I want to cut with this

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.320 
now if I want to cut with this
particular<00:02:15.440> tool<00:02:15.830> you<00:02:16.400> simply<00:02:16.790> turn<00:02:17.000> it<00:02:17.180> to

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
particular tool you simply turn it to

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.050 
particular tool you simply turn it to
its<00:02:17.540> side<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:18.140> you'll<00:02:18.590> see<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:19.250> same<00:02:19.519> piston

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
its side and you'll see the same piston

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:31.210 
its side and you'll see the same piston
will<00:02:20.330> come<00:02:20.540> out<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.290> test<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.709> barge<00:02:30.950> is

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
will come out and the test the barge is

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.220 
will come out and the test the barge is
the<00:02:31.310> matter<00:02:31.519> of<00:02:31.670> a<00:02:31.760> few<00:02:31.940> seconds<00:02:32.390> there's<00:02:33.170> a

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
the matter of a few seconds there's a

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.080 
the matter of a few seconds there's a
release<00:02:33.620> valve<00:02:33.860> here<00:02:34.250> on<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.489> side<00:02:34.730> so

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
release valve here on the side so

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.550 
release valve here on the side so
whether<00:02:35.330> you're<00:02:35.600> releasing<00:02:36.080> it<00:02:36.230> from<00:02:36.410> the

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
whether you're releasing it from the

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.860 
whether you're releasing it from the
cutting<00:02:36.950> or<00:02:37.430> you're<00:02:38.030> releasing<00:02:38.480> it<00:02:38.600> from<00:02:38.720> the

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
cutting or you're releasing it from the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.229 
cutting or you're releasing it from the
bending<00:02:39.260> it's<00:02:39.410> the<00:02:39.560> same<00:02:39.799> release<00:02:40.190> valve<00:02:40.549> so<00:02:41.209> I

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
bending it's the same release valve so I

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:42.610 
bending it's the same release valve so I
don't<00:02:41.510> have<00:02:41.660> to<00:02:41.780> run<00:02:41.930> it<00:02:42.080> all<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.290> way<00:02:42.380> back

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
don't have to run it all the way back

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.190 
don't have to run it all the way back
say<00:02:42.920> if<00:02:43.100> I'm<00:02:43.250> doing<00:02:43.549> several<00:02:43.940> cuts<00:02:44.180> then<00:02:44.900> I<00:02:45.019> can

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
say if I'm doing several cuts then I can

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.670 
say if I'm doing several cuts then I can
just<00:02:45.380> keep<00:02:49.420> and<00:02:50.420> then<00:02:51.049> of<00:02:51.200> course<00:02:51.230> if<00:02:51.560> I'm

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
just keep and then of course if I'm

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.500 
just keep and then of course if I'm
doing<00:02:51.950> bends<00:02:52.250> you<00:02:52.790> need<00:02:53.000> it<00:02:53.120> to<00:02:53.209> have<00:02:53.360> it

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
doing bends you need it to have it

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.390 
doing bends you need it to have it
rotate<00:02:53.870> all<00:02:54.049> the<00:02:54.080> way<00:02:54.260> back<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.680> its<00:02:54.860> zero

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
rotate all the way back to its zero

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.240 
rotate all the way back to its zero
position<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:56.239> then<00:02:57.079> you<00:02:57.260> can<00:02:57.470> turn<00:02:58.010> it<00:02:58.070> over

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
position and then you can turn it over

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.270 
position and then you can turn it over
