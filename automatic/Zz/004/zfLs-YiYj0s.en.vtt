00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:24.699 
really show the details of just how

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.120 
really show the details of just how
different<00:00:25.000> they<00:00:25.240> are<00:00:25.650> because<00:00:26.650> that's<00:00:26.890> one<00:00:27.039> of

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
different they are because that's one of

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.999 
different they are because that's one of
the<00:00:27.189> biggest<00:00:27.369> things<00:00:27.699> is<00:00:28.560> not<00:00:29.560> only<00:00:29.710> kind<00:00:29.949> of

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009 
the biggest things is not only kind of

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.600 
the biggest things is not only kind of
how<00:00:30.070> it<00:00:30.250> falls<00:00:30.519> how<00:00:31.150> it<00:00:31.300> reacts<00:00:32.490> obviously<00:00:33.490> it

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
how it falls how it reacts obviously it

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.490 
how it falls how it reacts obviously it
moves<00:00:33.850> it<00:00:34.180> has<00:00:34.330> proper<00:00:34.750> gravity<00:00:35.170> splits

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
moves it has proper gravity splits

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.959 
moves it has proper gravity splits
meaning<00:00:35.890> that<00:00:36.010> when<00:00:36.190> you<00:00:36.310> kind<00:00:36.430> of<00:00:36.520> push<00:00:36.820> it

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969 
meaning that when you kind of push it

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:41.369 
meaning that when you kind of push it
back<00:00:37.239> and<00:00:37.989> push<00:00:38.260> it<00:00:38.379> forward<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:40.450> splits<00:00:41.230> like

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
back and push it forward it splits like

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.410

walk out the door the nice thing about

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.619 
walk out the door the nice thing about
these<00:01:03.190> systems<00:01:03.670> too<00:01:03.940> is<00:01:04.090> that<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:04.300> hair<00:01:04.449> has<00:01:04.600> a

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
these systems too is that the hair has a

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.040 
these systems too is that the hair has a
lot<00:01:04.840> of<00:01:04.870> movement<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:07.090> know<00:01:07.210> it'll<00:01:07.750> kind<00:01:07.930> of

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
lot of movement you know it'll kind of

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.640 
lot of movement you know it'll kind of
go<00:01:08.410> one<00:01:08.619> side<00:01:08.860> go<00:01:09.670> to<00:01:09.729> the<00:01:09.939> other<00:01:10.030> side<00:01:10.650> because

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
something that's kind of again that's

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.270 
something that's kind of again that's
thicker<00:01:17.470> and<00:01:17.710> heavier<00:01:19.799> it's<00:01:20.799> good<00:01:20.979> laid<00:01:21.130> out

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
thicker and heavier it's good laid out

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.970

I<00:01:25.100> haven't<00:01:25.700> really<00:01:25.940> had<00:01:26.090> a<00:01:26.150> need<00:01:26.450> of<00:01:26.480> a<00:01:26.780> real

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
I haven't really had a need of a real

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.280 
I haven't really had a need of a real
yeah<00:01:28.520> but<00:01:31.480> the<00:01:32.480> whole<00:01:32.630> point<00:01:32.660> of<00:01:32.930> it<00:01:33.050> when<00:01:33.200> this

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
it's very much made specifically for ham

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.700 
it's very much made specifically for ham
again<00:01:41.330> I<00:01:41.510> can<00:01:41.720> just<00:01:41.870> take<00:01:41.990> my<00:01:42.140> comb<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:42.530> bring

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
again I can just take my comb and bring

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.750 
again I can just take my comb and bring
it<00:01:42.800> right<00:01:42.890> up<00:01:42.950> through<00:01:43.160> and<00:01:43.370> you<00:01:43.430> can<00:01:43.550> kind<00:01:43.640> of

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
it right up through and you can kind of

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.670 
it right up through and you can kind of
see<00:01:43.940> it's<00:01:44.330> seamless<00:01:44.630> there's<00:01:45.230> nothing<00:01:45.530> you

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
see it's seamless there's nothing you

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:56.620 
see it's seamless there's nothing you

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
actually going to use a little bit of

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.020 
actually going to use a little bit of
product<00:01:58.950> not<00:01:59.220> too<00:01:59.430> much<00:02:00.020> but<00:02:01.760> or<00:02:02.760> just<00:02:02.940> like

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
product not too much but or just like

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.790 
product not too much but or just like
your<00:02:03.150> natural<00:02:03.300> hair<00:02:03.630> just<00:02:03.840> run<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.590> through<00:02:04.770> a

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
your natural hair just run it through a

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:12.260 
your natural hair just run it through a
mess<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.100> around<00:02:10.310> again<00:02:11.310> if<00:02:11.490> he<00:02:11.610> wants<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.090> he

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
mess it around again if he wants to he

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.580 
mess it around again if he wants to he
can<00:02:12.300> wash<00:02:12.630> this<00:02:12.930> on<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.170> daily<00:02:13.350> basis<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:15.590> the

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
can wash this on a daily basis and the

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.080
