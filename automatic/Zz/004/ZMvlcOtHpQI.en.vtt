00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
one which is a clash of kings I went for

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.310

the<00:00:34.579> TV<00:00:35.579> series<00:00:35.820> covers<00:00:36.480> only<00:00:36.750> due<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
the TV series covers only due to the

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.020 
the TV series covers only due to the
fact<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.620> these<00:00:37.860> books<00:00:38.250> are<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.520> lot<00:00:38.820> larger

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
fact that these books are a lot larger

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.030 
fact that these books are a lot larger
than<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.840> mass<00:00:40.020> produced<00:00:40.500> paperback

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
than the mass produced paperback

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.490 
than the mass produced paperback
editions<00:00:41.460> which<00:00:42.090> were<00:00:42.360> probably<00:00:42.960> about<00:00:43.140> this

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
editions which were probably about this

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.619 
editions which were probably about this
size<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.280> just<00:00:44.670> don't<00:00:44.910> think<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.420> could

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
size and I just don't think I could

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.340 
size and I just don't think I could
enjoy<00:00:46.620> reading<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.250> at<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.610> size<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.140> want

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
enjoy reading it at that size so I want

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.959 
enjoy reading it at that size so I want
for<00:00:49.469> these<00:00:49.559> ones<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.129> don't<00:00:50.309> mind<00:00:50.489> them<00:00:50.730> at

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
for these ones and I don't mind them at

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.420 
for these ones and I don't mind them at
all<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.690> probably<00:00:51.870> my<00:00:52.140> least<00:00:52.949> favorite

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
all this is probably my least favorite

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.000
