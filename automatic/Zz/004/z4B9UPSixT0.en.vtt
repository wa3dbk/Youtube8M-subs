me I think a lot of people don't realize

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.860 
me I think a lot of people don't realize
at<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.370> moment<00:03:06.670> that<00:03:06.850> this<00:03:06.940> is<00:03:07.090> not<00:03:07.240> merely<00:03:07.660> an

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
at the moment that this is not merely an

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.260 
at the moment that this is not merely an
aesthetic<00:03:08.470> kind<00:03:08.830> of<00:03:08.920> technique<00:03:09.310> we<00:03:09.910> could<00:03:10.120> go

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
aesthetic kind of technique we could go

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.160 
aesthetic kind of technique we could go
so<00:03:11.170> much<00:03:11.350> deeper<00:03:11.410> and<00:03:11.830> it<00:03:12.460> has<00:03:12.670> a<00:03:12.700> lot<00:03:13.120> of

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
so much deeper and it has a lot of

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.360 
so much deeper and it has a lot of
technical<00:03:14.170> as<00:03:14.560> well<00:03:14.860> as<00:03:14.980> they're<00:03:15.100> setting

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
technical as well as they're setting

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.920 
technical as well as they're setting
applications<00:03:15.940> and<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.180> me<00:03:16.270> this<00:03:16.390> is<00:03:16.450> exciting

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
applications and to me this is exciting

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.290 
applications and to me this is exciting
yeah<00:03:17.770> that's<00:03:17.980> gonna<00:03:18.160> open<00:03:18.520> an<00:03:18.880> ice-filled

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
yeah that's gonna open an ice-filled
