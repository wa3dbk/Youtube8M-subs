 lufthansa the boeing 747 8 is the 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.590
 American answer to the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.570
 European Airbus 380 with 76.3 meters 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.000
 the longest passenger aircraft in the world 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.890
 and a complete overhaul of the old one 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.410
 jumbos is one of them 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.239
 lower fuel consumption around 20 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.030
 percent less kerosene consumed the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.890
 boeing 747 8 on the ferry flight 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.700
 from Seattle to Frankfurt as the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.920
 comparable 747,400 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.300
 the 747 400 is different 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.830
 essential first course of the 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.140
 long ago that is five meters sixty 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.730
 longer and of course wider 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.450
 we now have 68 meters 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.830
 span instead of 65 yards earlier and you 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.960
 has new engines she has a new one 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.590
 area get a super critical 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.780
 wing 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.239
 she has some in the avionics front 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.620
 features get incorporated into boeing 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.910
 we have always been on the 400 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.920
 have desired is a bit 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.990
 Schreiber had come to that, that is 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.680
 we'll be the ones on us, for example 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.110
 as they are outward across or and the 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.830
 spiders operator argue about what has happened so far 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.600
 not the case 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.490
 this is also new at lufthansa 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.220
 Seating concept for the business class and 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.810
 the first class for around 12,000 euros 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.210
 you can in the future, for example, from 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.130
 Munich to san francisco im 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.290
 So greatest luxury fly a 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.240
 well-known difference is quite 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.490
 just that our first class now 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.420
 here in the forefront is while in 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:41.479
 the 747 400 you up in our body 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.280
 deck was open to them continuously 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.679
 disposal when they come on board 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.000

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.670
 Of course we have different kits 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:56.070
 we give them as are toothbrushes 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.570
 Trainers or high quality creams you 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.660
 Also get it right when you come here 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.700

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.619
 journals selection was and they will 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.750
 Immediately with a champagne or something 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.119
 whatever you wish to receive 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.890
 we notice ours very quickly 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.810
 Guests are important as they are 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.150
 feel comfortable if you prefer the privacy 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.350
 search or talk 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.170
 Do you want to talk about the new one? 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.510
 Flyers want to talk to what they love 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.550
 what they are open for and we stand 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.530
 Of course always available for 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.190
 the crews it in the new super jumbo something 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.959
 more comfortable 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.880
 during a long haul flight can 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.770
 now one of the two pilots in 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.140
 a slightly more spacious cabin 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.239
 withdraw better in that it only 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.580
 a bed has got a seat to it 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.470
 has installed an entertainment system 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.180
 at least you can get music there 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.130
 with what to hear except for board entertainment 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.540
 so far it was not the case and it is 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.130
 in my opinion also bigger and 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.989
 has become longer so it is wider that 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.690
 bed and it is longer than on the 747 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.190
 400 so far like this saves a hurry 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.330
 At the same time, what we look for is two 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.130
 comfort for the passengers 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.690
 usually offer but it is 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.340
 completely enough for what you want 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.040
 she needs my round out for and 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.769
 there will be about 1200 guests and 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.350
 Journalists have the boeing 747 8 at 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.459

 the little brothers of the 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.260
 big boeing to be confused with 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.360
 already available models 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.700
 the beginning of a big collect series 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.160
