00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
was the pure voice that is that that's

was the pure voice that is that that's
uma<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:14.560> uma<00:04:14.860> right<00:04:15.040> pure<00:04:15.670> voice<00:04:15.820> is<00:04:16.060> a<00:04:16.090> brand

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
uma the uma right pure voice is a brand

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.779 
uma the uma right pure voice is a brand
new<00:04:16.660> technology<00:04:17.380> that<00:04:17.410> we've<00:04:17.739> introduced<00:04:18.220> for

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
new technology that we've introduced for

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:20.460 
new technology that we've introduced for
all<00:04:18.970> looma<00:04:19.390> platforms

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
all looma platforms

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.440 
all looma platforms
and<00:04:20.590> effectively<00:04:21.160> what<00:04:21.730> it<00:04:21.880> does<00:04:22.090> when<00:04:22.330> it

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
and effectively what it does when it

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.350 
and effectively what it does when it
starts<00:04:22.810> to<00:04:22.960> detect<00:04:23.380> packet<00:04:23.920> loss<00:04:24.130> or<00:04:24.460> a<00:04:24.580> kind

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
starts to detect packet loss or a kind

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.720 
starts to detect packet loss or a kind
of<00:04:25.420> a<00:04:25.570> congested<00:04:26.440> network<00:04:26.860> will<00:04:27.430> start

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
of a congested network will start

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.300 
of a congested network will start
multiplying<00:04:28.180> the<00:04:28.900> number<00:04:29.260> of<00:04:29.290> packets<00:04:29.860> sent

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
multiplying the number of packets sent

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.640 
multiplying the number of packets sent
so<00:04:30.850> that<00:04:30.880> when<00:04:31.240> it<00:04:31.330> gets<00:04:31.510> to<00:04:31.660> our<00:04:31.900> system<00:04:32.500> in

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
so that when it gets to our system in

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.310 
so that when it gets to our system in
the<00:04:32.770> cloud<00:04:32.920> we<00:04:33.700> can<00:04:33.910> decode<00:04:34.330> a<00:04:34.390> pure<00:04:34.960> voice

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
the cloud we can decode a pure voice

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.430 
the cloud we can decode a pure voice
stream<00:04:35.800> even<00:04:36.490> if<00:04:36.610> there's<00:04:36.820> up<00:04:37.060> to<00:04:37.090> 50%<00:04:37.600> packet

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.440 
stream even if there's up to 50% packet
loss<00:04:38.620> so<00:04:39.100> you're<00:04:39.280> introducing<00:04:39.970> purposely

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
loss so you're introducing purposely

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.900

introducing<00:04:40.960> redundancy<00:04:41.650> into<00:04:42.250> into<00:04:42.760> the
