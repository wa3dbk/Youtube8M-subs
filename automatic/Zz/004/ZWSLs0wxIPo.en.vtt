00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:08.309
 hello it's been about 10 days since 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.370
 since the potato has risen right now 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.950
 the beginning of June 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.849
 today we will be busy with hilling potatoes 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.640
 and 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.690
 and and mulching a week ago like 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.080
 just appeared 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.760
 I shook the potato shoots 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.789
 and at the same time cut the weeds 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:34.160
 as you see on the bed 1 meter wide 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.600
 I have made two potato rows 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.430
 so 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:43.340
 spud potatoes I'll only 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:47.149
 sides of the aisle as you already know 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:53.160
 hilling is her cellar 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:56.960
 stalks of land for the purpose of education on them 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.750
 extra roots and stolons 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.989
 that is, to increase the nutrition area 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:08.700
 bush but before hilling 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:14.320
 I decided to sprinkle potato rows 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.979
 humus on one or two thighs on 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.979
 square meter 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:33.680
 and that on a bed length of three and a half 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.990
 I took two and a half meters 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:44.340
 ten-liter bucket of humus 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:46.939
 now let's aku than a potato with 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.939
 side aisle 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.050
 You can immediately spud potatoes 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.770
 because more hilling we do 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.869
 we will not all 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.630
 a bed and a pile now left her 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.110
 just grumble 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:14.170
 as mulch can be used 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.070
 green manure fell grass 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:23.320
 but since I have few of them on the site 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.320
 so I will use sawdust 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:32.300
 age of sawdust which i will 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:37.280
 use about five years or maybe 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:41.800
 even im even more that is nitrogen from 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:45.640
 soil they already will not take 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:50.110
 look like this sawdust 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:52.820
 as you see they are already half decomposed 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.550
 therefore, they can be safely used as 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.670
 mulch 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:01.810
 scatter them on a bed of about 5 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.810
 10 centimeters 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:11.990
 sawdust already packed enough 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:15.920
 so they will not have to be in the summer often 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.920
 pour and add new ones 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:29.120
 potato is very important to mulch to 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:34.510
 the onset of summer fats already at 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:38.830
 soil temperature above 23 25 degrees 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:44.420
 the potato stops tying the tubers 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:50.019
 because the plant is already wasting energy and pouring 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.019
 potato she moisture evaporation 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.410
 Here is what a bunch of I and 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.970
 mulch potato bed 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:06.319
