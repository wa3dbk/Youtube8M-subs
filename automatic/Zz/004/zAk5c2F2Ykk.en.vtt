till<00:01:01.079> now<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:01.590> have<00:01:01.739> got<00:01:01.980> good<00:01:02.190> we<00:01:02.610> have

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
till now we have got good we have

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.630 
till now we have got good we have
collected<00:01:03.360> around<00:01:03.870> three<00:01:04.680> liters<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.129> our

now<00:01:09.880> you<00:01:09.939> can<00:01:10.299> see<00:01:10.570> how<00:01:10.960> the<00:01:11.020> corners<00:01:11.560> is

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
now you can see how the corners is

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.510 
now you can see how the corners is
actually<00:01:12.340> fired<00:01:13.380> here<00:01:14.380> Borman<00:01:14.859> is<00:01:14.890> holding<00:01:15.369> up

because<00:06:17.840> of<00:06:18.140> the<00:06:18.380> large<00:06:18.590> amounts<00:06:19.220> of<00:06:19.310> gaseous

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 
because of the large amounts of gaseous

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.080 
because of the large amounts of gaseous
emissions<00:06:20.500> which<00:06:21.500> take<00:06:21.800> place<00:06:22.010> during<00:06:22.789> the

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 
emissions which take place during the

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.980 
emissions which take place during the
process<00:06:23.510> of<00:06:23.660> carbonization<00:06:24.320> of<00:06:24.830> bamboo<00:06:25.990> now

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
process of carbonization of bamboo now

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.980 
process of carbonization of bamboo now
you<00:06:27.050> can<00:06:27.350> see<00:06:27.680> that<00:06:28.610> the<00:06:28.910> lid<00:06:29.150> to<00:06:29.450> the<00:06:29.539> furnace

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
you can see that the lid to the furnace

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.219 
you can see that the lid to the furnace
has<00:06:30.200> been<00:06:30.500> opened<00:06:30.919> and<00:06:31.750> Bormann<00:06:32.750> here<00:06:33.020> is

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:33.229 
has been opened and Bormann here is

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:35.469 
has been opened and Bormann here is
right<00:06:33.470> now<00:06:33.650> cooling<00:06:34.010> the<00:06:34.280> furnace<00:06:34.700> so<00:06:35.150> that<00:06:35.300> we

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:35.479 
right now cooling the furnace so that we

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:38.320 
right now cooling the furnace so that we
may<00:06:35.660> remove<00:06:35.990> the<00:06:36.470> bamboo<00:06:36.800> charcoal<00:06:37.310> has<00:06:37.580> been

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330 
may remove the bamboo charcoal has been

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.980 
may remove the bamboo charcoal has been
formed<00:06:38.690> inside<00:06:39.460> we<00:06:40.460> actually

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990 
formed inside we actually

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.930 
formed inside we actually
see<00:06:41.460> the<00:06:42.460> cooling<00:06:42.850> process<00:06:43.920> in<00:06:44.920> place<00:06:45.250> and<00:06:45.580> you

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:45.940 
see the cooling process in place and you

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.450 
see the cooling process in place and you
may<00:06:46.090> clear<00:06:46.420> the<00:06:46.630> bamboo<00:06:47.050> culms<00:06:47.410> cracking<00:06:48.220> as

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:48.460 
may clear the bamboo culms cracking as

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.990 
may clear the bamboo culms cracking as
the<00:06:49.270> water<00:06:49.480> is<00:06:49.750> poured<00:06:50.140> inside<00:06:50.620> to<00:06:51.430> cool<00:06:51.670> the

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 
the water is poured inside to cool the
