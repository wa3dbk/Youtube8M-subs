00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.830
 hello dear friends imagine 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.390
 your review is enough 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.080
 interesting things namely the lens for 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.500
 iphone 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.240
 it is not so common in Russia 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.540
 what official manufacturers are 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.379
 do not usually supply such accessories to 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.050
 to our country 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.180
 Well, in Europe or in America it is very 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.970
 strongly enjoy the success of just 1 that 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.769
 people like to take pictures on their 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.599
 mobile devices in particular iPhones 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.019
 and in this case I can look at 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.000
 lens for iphone 5 is a view of the 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.960
 standing on so now lying on the table 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.550
 so here is a little in Europe love 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.040
 take pictures of your devices all over 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.750
 posting some social networks this 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.989
 really comfortable enough therefore 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.000
 I bought all that stuff and 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.350
 I just want to share with you now 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.110
 information they 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.539
 well, and accordingly , and you show but 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.570
 let's see yes everything is in order but 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.280
 let's start with you just to understand 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.250
 let's see what it's called 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.899
 called lens alla clip in this 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.540
 case we look at the version for 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.049
 iphone 5 but there is also a version 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.880
 for iphone 4 &amp; 4s 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.950
 Well, that's basically all you want 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.000
 say about the lens itself in case 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.119
 let's first look at 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.689
 complete set complete set as in all 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.330
 The lens in principle is so modest but 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:26.909
 all you need is a bag 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.420
 in order to transport the lens 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.100
 also we can be with you here 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.100
 see the lens itself but before that 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.229
 I want to say about the special stub 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.189
 that protect your lens during 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:45.330
 transportation here so here and more here 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.250
 such they are usually such 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.500
 on rubber plugs to your 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.820
 the lens didn't scratch well 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.630
 accordingly see the most 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.390
 lens that's it like you me i have it already 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.320
 disassembled before that protection taking I will explain 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.510
 a little bit later 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.150
 well here's what it looks like let me set it up 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:08.010
 focus so you can see it better 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.960
 such is it 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.330
 there is a lens fisheye because he 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.760
 so wide but from this side 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.650
 there is a macro lens and if more 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.930
 screw here is such a small 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.150
 gizmo it becomes wide-angle this 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.520
 very comfortable because you can wear 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.880
 at once three in one such lens 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.050
 you do not have to get such big ones 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.750
 change as on SLR cameras 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.720
 naturally you guys as you understand yes 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.870
 Well, from the experience of using mirror 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:41.180
 cameras you can understand that in order to 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.770
 shoot some footage and jumped well 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.080
 under various conditions you will need 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.410
 various lenses 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:52.010
 Naturally in the phone manufacturers 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:55.630
 put put trying to put such 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.430
 cameras that will shoot well in 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.010
 most of the possibilities most 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.020
 me situations accordingly if you 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.820
 want to take real macro shots of you 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.040
 like this lens here if 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.420
 do you want to shoot the real one 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.820
 wide some kind of beauty you so 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.130
 etc. but this let us now look 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.840
 as he puts on our phone here 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.520
 behind we see that here we are 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.320
 the camera is located right on the bottom and 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.330
 power button is not very convenient 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.430
 Due to the fact that because of this, you can not 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.470
 turn his phone on and off during 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.560
 the shooting time on the objective principle is not 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.510
 so difficult to take off and dress for 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.130
 to make it a problem 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.060
 he dresses very simply you just 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.740
 see where the notch of the special button and 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.050
 wear straight as you need this 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.380
 the lens here so here and here we go 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:45.470
 the camera itself behind is so big on 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.140
 Dashin's ball sticks out and you can calmly 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.830
 shoot let's run the application 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:55.700
 camera well and you see if you look 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:58.400
 right before then we see just vague 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:05.720
 the image is not visible but if we 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:08.720
 examples of our column will bring here 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.630
 about now see and completing 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.910
 focused and looks very beautiful 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.830
 but I won't even show you with 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.080
 how he photographs but how it is necessary with 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.380
 we are still not in such conditions therefore 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:24.740
 I'll take it off immediately and turn it off and we are not 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.440
 you will proceed to discuss why 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.550
 after all, itâ€™s a lens 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.970
 what do you want to say 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.350
 Naturally, if you take pictures often 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.450
 on your phone and if you have 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.790
 opportunity to buy such a lens i have it 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.919
 sincerely advise because it will 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.290
 very useful thing for your iphone 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.850
 it takes instead not so much it costs 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.340
 also not very much considering what 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.560
 lenses for good SLR cameras 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.930
 good objectively naturally not worth it 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.850
 much more where 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.650
 and accordingly if you have such 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.669
 lens i think for iphone 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:01.280
 you won't be able to buy 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:05.000
 This lens is very cool 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.940
 warmed up very cool you post 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.220

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.660
 test shots read about this finish 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.139

 everything appeared completely clear and so 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.160

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:33.410

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:36.110
 I remind you that it cost me about 3000 rubles 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:38.180
