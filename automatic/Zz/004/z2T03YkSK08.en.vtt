00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:29.259
 the owner of this car turned to 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.710
 us with such a story the car stopped 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.610
 go 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.730
 acceleration dynamics has significantly deteriorated 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.010
 car owner 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.180
 after consulting with your friends and 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.460
 neighbors in the garage 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.420
 concluded box malfunction 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.980
 Shifting purchased new gearbox 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.329
 self pro and make a replacement but 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.670
 the problem did not disappear 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.860
 he decided to contact us we came to 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.980
 the conclusion that you need to hold a full 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.290
 vehicle system diagnostics for complete 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.920
 car diagnostics we use 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.780
 various devices 1 these brand scan with 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.989
 his help we remove all testimony 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.479
 onboard computer and find out the reasons 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.540
 engine malfunction and gearbox and other 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:13.180
 electronic systems 2 device motor tester 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.590
 it allows us to check the health and 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.159
 with attachments 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.220
 generator starter ignition system and 3 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.500
 gas analyzer with it we 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.150
 find out how correct and served 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.840
 to the combustion chamber the proportion of fuel and y 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.120
 how full is the mixture burns but also 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.220
 visual inspection of mechanical parts then 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.660
 abel is very important for 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.500
 There are specialized 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:42.080
 devices like video endoscope and four 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.700
 the diagnostic component allows that is 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.620
 and a complete survey of all systems 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.310
 car what turned out in the process 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.500
 Diagnosis turned old CAT was 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.120
 full order 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.280
 problems were in the ignition system and 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.830
 fuel delivery system and as a result 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.840
 this problem with a catalyst for two s 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.550
 half years of operation the owner or 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.979
 never changed spark plugs and not 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.050
 spent cleaning the fuel system it 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.729
 led almost to burnout 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.619
 ceramic insulator central 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.209
 electrons on candles and in conditions 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.520
 high pressure in cylinders 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.340
 led ignition passes and 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.320
 incomplete combustion of the fuel mixture except 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.330
 In addition to the nozzle accumulated significant 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.430
 deposits that prevented create 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.620
 the correct form of the torch it all created 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.990
 conditions for the problem and 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.300
 burnt fuel gets into catalyst 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.580
 in the end we score the so-called 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.620
 potato exhaust effect 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.450
 we could find out all this thanks 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.489
 complete diagnostics with use 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.709
 newest equipment owner 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.110
 car as a result left 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.680
 spare gearbox to say that is not done 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.680
 getting better
