00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
vault it probably is one at least we

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.020 
vault it probably is one at least we
think<00:01:01.230> if<00:01:01.440> there<00:01:01.649> are<00:01:01.710> any<00:01:01.800> big<00:01:02.429> problems<00:01:02.850> on

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
think if there are any big problems on

this<00:01:05.430> was<00:01:05.640> clearly<00:01:05.940> built<00:01:06.300> to<00:01:06.480> last<00:01:06.630> we<00:01:07.530> we

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
this was clearly built to last we we

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.800 
this was clearly built to last we we
built<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.370> last<00:01:08.520> as<00:01:08.820> long<00:01:09.030> as<00:01:09.390> we<00:01:09.630> could

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
built it to last as long as we could

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.750 
built it to last as long as we could
imagine<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.500> don't<00:01:10.830> know<00:01:10.980> what<00:01:11.220> was<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
imagine I don't know what was in the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.550 
imagine I don't know what was in the
minds<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.270> people<00:01:12.570> who<00:01:12.690> thought<00:01:13.380> the

minds of the people who thought the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.340 
minds of the people who thought the
pyramids<00:01:14.510> maybe<00:01:15.510> they<00:01:15.720> were<00:01:15.870> building<00:01:16.200> to

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
pyramids maybe they were building to

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.830 
pyramids maybe they were building to
last<00:01:16.560> forever<00:01:16.860> too<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.150> can't<00:01:18.270> think<00:01:18.750> of

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
last forever too but I can't think of

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.270 
last forever too but I can't think of
anything<00:01:19.110> that's<00:01:19.470> been<00:01:19.740> built<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.130> our

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
anything that's been built in our

anything that's been built in our
lifetime<00:01:20.820> it's<00:01:21.360> been<00:01:21.540> built<00:01:21.780> with<00:01:21.870> this<00:01:22.020> kind

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.230 
lifetime it's been built with this kind

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.380 
lifetime it's been built with this kind
of<00:01:22.260> time<00:01:22.500> horizon<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.310> all<00:01:23.580> these<00:01:23.760> pipes<00:01:24.120> over

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
phrase it even further freeze it colder

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.120 
phrase it even further freeze it colder
than<00:01:36.120> the<00:01:36.240> permafrost<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.740> if<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.980> earth

what's<00:01:46.509> in<00:01:46.750> these<00:01:47.020> boxes<00:01:47.350> took<00:01:48.390> 10,000<00:01:49.390> years

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
what's in these boxes took 10,000 years

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.249 
what's in these boxes took 10,000 years
to<00:01:49.930> develop<00:01:50.110> and<00:01:50.590> 70<00:01:51.579> years<00:01:51.610> to<00:01:51.939> collect<00:01:52.299> now

wow<00:02:06.600> it's<00:02:07.600> pretty<00:02:07.929> big<00:02:08.110> so<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:09.160> foundation<00:02:09.849> of

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
wow it's pretty big so the foundation of

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.289 
wow it's pretty big so the foundation of
