things to it this case is waterproof up
to<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:09.870> depth<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.469> 6.6<00:00:11.219> feet<00:00:11.340> it<00:00:11.790> is<00:00:12.000> droppable

lifeproof<00:00:17.730> cases<00:00:18.029> are<00:00:18.390> probably<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.260> way<00:00:19.439> to

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
lifeproof cases are probably the way to

lifeproof cases are probably the way to
go<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:20.220> am<00:00:20.369> pretty<00:00:20.970> surprised<00:00:21.510> at<00:00:21.660> how<00:00:21.720> thin

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260

this<00:00:22.470> case<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:23.010> given<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.490> amount<00:00:23.699> of

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
this case is given the amount of

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.460 
this case is given the amount of
protection<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.390> provides<00:00:24.420> we've<00:00:25.289> already

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
protection it provides we've already

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.290 
protection it provides we've already
done<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.830> water<00:00:26.039> test<00:00:26.400> for<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.670> left<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.029> in<00:00:27.119> a

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
done the water test for it left it in a

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.570 
done the water test for it left it in a
bucket<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.779> water<00:00:27.960> for<00:00:28.260> about<00:00:28.380> 6<00:00:28.890> or<00:00:29.160> 30

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
bucket of water for about 6 or 30

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.910 
bucket of water for about 6 or 30
minutes<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.900> we<00:00:31.080> took<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.289> look<00:00:31.439> inside<00:00:31.769> the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
minutes and we took a look inside the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.400 
minutes and we took a look inside the
case<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.399> it's<00:00:32.520> completely<00:00:32.969> dry<00:00:33.239> now<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.690> live

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
case and it's completely dry now I live

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.590 
case and it's completely dry now I live
in<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.739> landlocked<00:00:35.190> province<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.940> Alberta<00:00:36.360> we

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
in the landlocked province of Alberta we

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.209 
in the landlocked province of Alberta we
don't<00:00:36.780> touch<00:00:37.020> any<00:00:37.230> sort<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.590> large<00:00:37.800> body<00:00:38.100> a

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
don't touch any sort of large body a

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.190 
don't touch any sort of large body a
wider<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.910> best<00:00:39.180> thing<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.390> we<00:00:39.629> got<00:00:39.899> is

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
wider so the best thing that we got is

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.380 
wider so the best thing that we got is
this<00:00:40.800> little<00:00:41.100> garbage<00:00:41.399> can<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.730> water<00:00:41.879> I've

this little garbage can of water I've

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.310 
this little garbage can of water I've
got<00:00:42.660> an<00:00:42.809> iPhone<00:00:43.520> 6<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:45.090> used<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.780> saying<00:00:45.960> iPhone

the lifeproof fre as you can tell that's
an<00:01:01.050> iPhone<00:01:01.489> now<00:01:02.489> if<00:01:02.550> you're<00:01:02.670> wondering<00:01:03.000> how

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
an iPhone now if you're wondering how

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.640 
an iPhone now if you're wondering how
the<00:01:03.149> case<00:01:03.449> stays<00:01:03.690> waterproof<00:01:04.080> there<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.530> an

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
the case stays waterproof there is an

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.469 
the case stays waterproof there is an
inner<00:01:04.830> seal<00:01:05.159> on<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.430> inside<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:05.970> case<00:01:06.210> and

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
inner seal on the inside of the case and

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.330 
inner seal on the inside of the case and
the<00:01:06.659> two<00:01:06.810> pieces<00:01:07.200> just<00:01:07.350> really<00:01:07.740> snap<00:01:08.040> together

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
the two pieces just really snap together

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.219 
the two pieces just really snap together
one<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.180> things<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.450> did<00:01:09.630> notice<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.080> that

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
one of the things I did notice is that

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.810 
one of the things I did notice is that
when<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.530> case<00:01:10.770> doesn't<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.189> an<00:01:11.310> iPhone<00:01:11.670> in

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
when the case doesn't have an iPhone in

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.940 
when the case doesn't have an iPhone in
it's<00:01:12.030> got<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.299> it's<00:01:12.750> got<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.990> bit<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.380> warp<00:01:13.680> to

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
it's got a it's got a bit of a warp to

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.940 
it's got a it's got a bit of a warp to
it<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.310> guess<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.700> probably<00:01:15.030> adds<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
it and I guess that probably adds to the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.320 
it and I guess that probably adds to the
auto<00:01:16.950> protection<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> case<00:01:18.000> now<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
auto protection of the case now the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.630 
auto protection of the case now the
thing<00:01:18.630> with<00:01:18.750> waterproof<00:01:19.409> cases<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.310> if

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
thing with waterproof cases is that if

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.670 
thing with waterproof cases is that if
it's<00:01:20.850> not<00:01:21.479> going<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.810> leak<00:01:21.990> water<00:01:22.200> into<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
it's not going to leak water into the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.380 
it's not going to leak water into the
cavity<00:01:23.159> right<00:01:23.310> now<00:01:23.549> there's<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.939> good<00:01:24.119> chance

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
cavity right now there's a good chance

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.450 
cavity right now there's a good chance
that<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:25.560> going<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.770> be<00:01:25.860> waterproof<00:01:26.130> up<00:01:26.430> to

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
that it's going to be waterproof up to

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.730 
that it's going to be waterproof up to
6.6<00:01:26.820> feet<00:01:27.240> probably<00:01:27.720> even<00:01:27.900> deeper<00:01:28.500> only

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
6.6 feet probably even deeper only

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.499 
6.6 feet probably even deeper only
because<00:01:29.100> with<00:01:29.340> greater<00:01:29.670> water<00:01:29.939> pressure<00:01:30.270> it's

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
because with greater water pressure it's

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.780 
because with greater water pressure it's
going<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.750> clamp<00:01:31.020> down<00:01:31.229> on<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.979> cases<00:01:32.400> even

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
going to clamp down on the cases even

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.490 
going to clamp down on the cases even
more<00:01:33.030> as<00:01:33.180> creating<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.720> better<00:01:33.900> waterproof

more as creating a better waterproof

more as creating a better waterproof

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
waterproof case fail is when there was a

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.950 
waterproof case fail is when there was a
puncture<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.979> actual<00:01:38.540> oring<00:01:39.540> which<00:01:39.720> as

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
puncture in the actual oring which as

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.539 
puncture in the actual oring which as
the<00:01:40.229> pressure<00:01:40.470> increased<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.130> water<00:01:41.340> went

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
the pressure increased the water went

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.399 
the pressure increased the water went
through<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.790> puncture<00:01:42.180> but<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:43.020> doesn't<00:01:43.259> look

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
through the puncture but it doesn't look

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.450 
through the puncture but it doesn't look
like<00:01:43.590> there's<00:01:43.770> anything<00:01:43.979> wrong<00:01:44.250> with<00:01:44.430> that

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
of the thing of the screen really annoys

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.340 
of the thing of the screen really annoys
me<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:52.979> hey<00:01:53.159> what<00:01:53.579> can<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.820> do<00:01:53.939> about<00:01:54.180> that

5/8
I<00:02:38.550> think<00:02:39.180> that's<00:02:39.330> approximately<00:02:39.660> six<00:02:40.350> feet

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410

I think that's approximately six feet
will<00:02:40.590> drop<00:02:40.800> it<00:02:40.950> from<00:02:41.040> this<00:02:41.310> angle<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:41.940> we'll

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
will drop it from this angle and we'll

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.460 
will drop it from this angle and we'll
see<00:02:42.750> what<00:02:42.930> happens

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
to take it apart and right before we did

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
the video we went and smell I guess we

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.810 
the video we went and smell I guess we
measured<00:04:41.140> to<00:04:41.320> see<00:04:41.350> if<00:04:41.650> our<00:04:41.770> iPhone<00:04:42.100> 6<00:04:42.370> was<00:04:42.520> bent

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
by putting on a pretty flat surface and

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.740 
by putting on a pretty flat surface and
it<00:04:45.160> wasn't<00:04:45.490> so<00:04:45.760> be<00:04:45.910> interesting<00:04:46.090> to<00:04:46.420> see<00:04:46.600> after

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750

it wasn't so be interesting to see after
dropping<00:04:47.170> the<00:04:47.560> iPhone<00:04:47.950> 6<00:04:48.280> from<00:04:48.370> about<00:04:48.760> 6<00:04:49.120> feet

a couple of times a bunch of times from
about<00:04:51.340> 4<00:04:51.580> feet<00:04:51.760> if<00:04:52.030> the<00:04:52.540> iPhone<00:04:52.690> 6<00:04:53.290> remains

through the screen protector screen
protector<00:05:25.180> itself<00:05:25.540> seems<00:05:25.990> a<00:05:26.290> pretty<00:05:26.980> decent

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
protector itself seems a pretty decent

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.220 
protector itself seems a pretty decent
I'm<00:05:27.670> pretty<00:05:27.940> surprised<00:05:28.360> at<00:05:28.510> how<00:05:28.690> strong<00:05:29.080> the

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230 
I'm pretty surprised at how strong the

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.320 
I'm pretty surprised at how strong the
screen<00:05:29.500> protector<00:05:29.650> is<00:05:30.160> so<00:05:30.730> that<00:05:30.910> sound<00:05:31.150> is<00:05:31.300> a

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
screen protector is so that sound is a

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.910 
screen protector is so that sound is a
bunch<00:05:31.510> of<00:05:31.570> dogs<00:05:31.810> running<00:05:32.170> around<00:05:32.260> the<00:05:32.530> office

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920

bunch of dogs running around the office
which<00:05:33.520> is<00:05:33.670> always<00:05:33.880> pretty<00:05:34.240> awesome<00:05:34.630> so

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
which is always pretty awesome so

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.040 
which is always pretty awesome so
there's<00:05:35.710> the<00:05:35.920> phone<00:05:36.190> it's<00:05:37.090> still<00:05:37.570> pretty<00:05:38.200> flat

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
there's the phone it's still pretty flat

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.330 
there's the phone it's still pretty flat
that's<00:05:41.820> pretty<00:05:42.820> surprising<00:05:43.920> but<00:05:44.920> all<00:05:45.040> in<00:05:45.220> all

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
that's pretty surprising but all in all

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.360 
that's pretty surprising but all in all
after<00:05:45.520> all<00:05:45.790> that<00:05:45.970> torture<00:05:46.300> my<00:05:46.600> iPhone<00:05:47.050> 6<00:05:47.380> still
