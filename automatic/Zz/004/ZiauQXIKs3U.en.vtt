00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
stations and all this is just puzzling

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.710 
stations and all this is just puzzling
because<00:01:10.619> usually<00:01:11.250> extra<00:01:11.670> roads<00:01:11.909> are<00:01:12.150> built<00:01:12.479> to

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
because usually extra roads are built to

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.370 
because usually extra roads are built to
improve<00:01:13.080> traffic<00:01:14.180> so<00:01:15.180> why<00:01:15.450> does<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.110> brays

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
improve traffic so why does the brays

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.469 
improve traffic so why does the brays

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
minutes for sure the southern path takes

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.180 
minutes for sure the southern path takes
T<00:03:50.910> over<00:03:51.180> ten<00:03:51.390> minutes<00:03:51.570> and<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.440> time<00:03:52.680> depends

decision is fairly simple in the worst

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.039 
decision is fairly simple in the worst
case<00:04:07.890> all<00:04:08.160> 200<00:04:09.030> drivers<00:04:09.420> take<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:09.810> southern

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
case all 200 drivers take the southern

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.650 
case all 200 drivers take the southern
route<00:04:10.440> resulting<00:04:11.400> in<00:04:11.519> a<00:04:11.579> travel<00:04:11.970> time<00:04:12.150> of<00:04:12.359> 20

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
route resulting in a travel time of 20

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.099 
route resulting in a travel time of 20
minutes<00:04:13.639> this<00:04:14.639> is<00:04:14.700> no<00:04:15.299> worse<00:04:15.630> than<00:04:15.959> the

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
minutes this is no worse than the

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.789 
minutes this is no worse than the
northern<00:04:16.650> route<00:04:16.799> and<00:04:17.479> if<00:04:18.479> fewer<00:04:19.109> cars<00:04:19.500> take

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
northern route and if fewer cars take

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.800 
northern route and if fewer cars take
the<00:04:19.979> southern<00:04:20.190> route<00:04:20.519> then<00:04:21.390> it<00:04:21.539> will<00:04:21.659> be

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
the southern route then it will be

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.399 
the southern route then it will be
faster<00:04:22.729> so<00:04:23.729> the<00:04:23.909> southern<00:04:24.120> route<00:04:24.479> is<00:04:24.659> always

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:25.409 
faster so the southern route is always

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:26.240 
faster so the southern route is always
at<00:04:25.650> least<00:04:25.860> as

at least as

decision one option is the southern

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.990 
this logic holds true for every driver
and<00:05:02.790> therefore<00:05:03.720> we<00:05:03.930> can<00:05:04.140> conclude<00:05:04.620> that<00:05:05.000> all

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
and therefore we can conclude that all

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.860 
and therefore we can conclude that all
200<00:05:06.630> cars<00:05:06.900> take<00:05:07.530> the<00:05:07.710> same<00:05:07.950> route<00:05:08.540> this<00:05:09.540> means

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
200 cars take the same route this means

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.390 
200 cars take the same route this means
that<00:05:10.110> T<00:05:10.440> will<00:05:10.770> equal<00:05:10.980> 200<00:05:12.770> we<00:05:13.770> can<00:05:13.950> substitute

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
that T will equal 200 we can substitute

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.940 
that T will equal 200 we can substitute
that<00:05:14.610> value<00:05:14.820> in<00:05:15.419> and<00:05:15.660> calculate<00:05:16.230> that<00:05:16.800> the

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
that value in and calculate that the

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.370 
that value in and calculate that the

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
roads that depend on traffic take 20

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.990 
roads that depend on traffic take 20
minutes<00:05:19.560> each<00:05:21.350> adding<00:05:22.350> it<00:05:22.470> all<00:05:22.590> together<00:05:23.000> that

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
minutes each adding it all together that

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.570 
minutes each adding it all together that
means<00:05:24.180> the<00:05:24.390> travel<00:05:24.810> time<00:05:25.020> from<00:05:25.290> A<00:05:25.410> to<00:05:25.500> B<00:05:25.800> will
