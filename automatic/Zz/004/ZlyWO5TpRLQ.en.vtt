00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
for this exercise is just a straw some

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.109 
for this exercise is just a straw some
time<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.379> your<00:00:16.500> breath<00:00:16.680> so<00:00:17.670> begin<00:00:18.090> by

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
time and your breath so begin by

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.420 
time and your breath so begin by
breathing<00:00:18.779> for<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:18.990> minute<00:00:19.289> use<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.859> watch<00:00:20.160> to

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
breathing for a minute use a watch to

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.160 
breathing for a minute use a watch to
time<00:00:20.640> yourself<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.300> count<00:00:21.600> how<00:00:21.660> many<00:00:21.779> breath

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
time yourself and count how many breath

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.960 
time yourself and count how many breath
cycles<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.769> breathe<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.279> minute<00:00:23.550> now<00:00:23.760> one

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
cycles you breathe in a minute now one

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.230 
cycles you breathe in a minute now one
breath<00:00:24.210> cycle<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:24.750> an<00:00:25.199> inhale<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:25.859> an<00:00:25.949> exhale

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
breath cycle is an inhale and an exhale

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.820 
breath cycle is an inhale and an exhale
so<00:00:27.240> count<00:00:27.570> how<00:00:27.720> many<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.960> those<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.470> have<00:00:28.680> in

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
so count how many of those you have in

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.800 
so count how many of those you have in
one<00:00:28.980> minute<00:00:29.189> make<00:00:29.699> note<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.630> that's

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
one minute make note of that and that's

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.410 
one minute make note of that and that's
your<00:00:31.050> initial<00:00:31.650> baseline<00:00:32.120> and<00:00:33.120> then<00:00:33.270> you're

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
your initial baseline and then you're

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.670 
your initial baseline and then you're
going<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.630> start<00:00:33.870> breathing<00:00:34.020> with<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.290> straw

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
going to start breathing with the straw

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.500 
going to start breathing with the straw
when<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.399> use<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.760> straw<00:00:36.000> you're<00:00:36.180> inhaling

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
when you use the straw you're inhaling

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.299 
when you use the straw you're inhaling
through<00:00:36.809> your<00:00:36.899> nose<00:00:37.140> exhaling<00:00:37.920> through<00:00:38.250> your

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
through your nose exhaling through your

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.150 
through your nose exhaling through your
mouth<00:00:38.460> out<00:00:38.850> through<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.300> straw<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:40.160> when

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
mouth out through the straw and when

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.040 
mouth out through the straw and when
you're<00:00:41.309> using<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.760> straw<00:00:42.030> my<00:00:42.300> suggestion<00:00:42.899> is

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
you're using the straw my suggestion is

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.810 
you're using the straw my suggestion is
to<00:00:43.079> use<00:00:43.230> your<00:00:43.530> hand<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:44.040> help<00:00:44.190> support<00:00:44.670> it

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
to use your hand to help support it

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.090 
to use your hand to help support it
rather<00:00:45.180> than<00:00:45.480> just<00:00:45.690> letting<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.379> be<00:00:46.440> supported

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
rather than just letting it be supported

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.220 
rather than just letting it be supported
by<00:00:47.219> your<00:00:47.250> lips<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:48.239> just<00:00:48.420> lets<00:00:48.600> your<00:00:48.750> face<00:00:48.960> be<00:00:49.200> a

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
by your lips it just lets your face be a

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.340 
by your lips it just lets your face be a
little<00:00:49.500> bit<00:00:49.649> more<00:00:49.860> relaxed<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.170> so<00:00:52.170> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
little bit more relaxed and and so the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.040 
little bit more relaxed and and so the
whole<00:00:52.500> exercise<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.039> more<00:00:53.399> relaxing<00:00:54.050> so

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
whole exercise is more relaxing so

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.869 
whole exercise is more relaxing so
you're<00:00:55.350> going<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.590> do<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.890> start<00:00:56.520> out<00:00:56.670> again

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
you're going to do that start out again

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.170 
you're going to do that start out again
for<00:00:57.239> two<00:00:57.420> minutes<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.050> see<00:00:59.010> how<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.219> do<00:00:59.489> if<00:00:59.820> it

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
for two minutes and see how you do if it

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.880 
for two minutes and see how you do if it
starts<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.780> feel<00:01:00.960> like<00:01:01.199> you're<00:01:01.379> getting<00:01:01.500> more
