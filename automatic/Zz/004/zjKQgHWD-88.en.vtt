keep<00:01:38.619> this<00:01:38.829> card<00:01:39.219> so<00:01:39.520> you'll<00:01:39.820> always<00:01:40.240> know

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
keep this card so you'll always know

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.550 
keep this card so you'll always know
which<00:01:41.850> HP<00:01:42.850> cartridge<00:01:43.479> your<00:01:43.719> printer<00:01:44.049> use<00:01:44.289> is

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
which HP cartridge your printer use is

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.580 
which HP cartridge your printer use is
probably<00:01:45.219> a<00:01:45.310> good<00:01:45.520> idea<00:01:45.579> even<00:01:46.509> though<00:01:46.719> you

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
probably a good idea even though you

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:54.740 
probably a good idea even though you
already<00:01:47.799> have<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.789> cartridge<00:01:49.750> so<00:01:51.210> whoa<00:01:53.340> small

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
already have the cartridge so whoa small

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.010 
already have the cartridge so whoa small
light<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:59.229> far<00:01:59.560> everything<00:02:00.159> looks<00:02:00.549> good<00:02:01.360> but

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
light so far everything looks good but

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.120 
light so far everything looks good but
is<00:02:02.560> really<00:02:03.250> light<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:04.289> I<00:02:05.289> won't<00:02:05.560> say<00:02:05.860> it's

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
is really light and I won't say it's

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.430 
is really light and I won't say it's
cheap<00:02:06.700> feeling<00:02:07.450> or<00:02:07.899> anything<00:02:08.670> because<00:02:10.440> it

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
cheap feeling or anything because it

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.289 
cheap feeling or anything because it
does<00:02:11.769> look<00:02:11.880> well-made<00:02:13.349> but<00:02:14.489> anyway<00:02:15.489> they<00:02:16.180> got

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
does look well-made but anyway they got

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.220 
does look well-made but anyway they got
a<00:02:16.360> weird<00:02:17.579> proprietary<00:02:18.579> plug<00:02:19.120> which<00:02:19.780> isn't<00:02:20.200> a

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
a weird proprietary plug which isn't a

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.949 
a weird proprietary plug which isn't a
big<00:02:20.410> deal<00:02:20.709> because<00:02:21.239> well<00:02:22.239> it<00:02:22.329> might<00:02:22.510> be<00:02:22.690> a<00:02:22.720> big

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
big deal because well it might be a big

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:30.460 
big deal because well it might be a big
deal<00:02:23.230> if<00:02:23.440> you<00:02:23.590> lose<00:02:23.829> your<00:02:24.220> cord<00:02:24.849> or<00:02:25.209> break<00:02:25.480> it

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.640 

Deskjet<00:02:31.310> software<00:02:32.290> more<00:02:33.290> than<00:02:33.440> likely

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
Deskjet software more than likely

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.530 
Deskjet software more than likely
there's<00:02:34.100> an<00:02:34.280> update<00:02:34.700> for<00:02:34.970> that<00:02:35.150> on<00:02:35.360> the

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
there's an update for that on the

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.500 
there's an update for that on the
internet<00:02:35.930> so<00:02:36.260> I<00:02:36.560> might<00:02:37.490> or<00:02:37.790> might<00:02:37.940> not<00:02:38.000> use

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
internet so I might or might not use

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:53.270 
internet so I might or might not use
this<00:02:39.140> software

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.280 

instruction<00:02:54.280> booklet<00:02:54.700> I<00:02:54.730> guess<00:02:55.060> don't<00:02:56.020> need

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
instruction booklet I guess don't need

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.310 
instruction booklet I guess don't need
that<00:02:59.700> well<00:03:00.700> maybe<00:03:00.940> that's<00:03:01.240> not<00:03:01.360> instructions

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
that well maybe that's not instructions

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:19.770 
that well maybe that's not instructions
what<00:03:02.650> is<00:03:02.800> this<00:03:06.450> yeah<00:03:07.450> gets<00:03:07.810> its<00:03:08.050> orders

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.980 

yeah<00:03:20.780> warranty<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:25.450> we'll<00:03:26.450> get<00:03:26.600> rid<00:03:26.810> of<00:03:26.840> the

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
yeah warranty and we'll get rid of the

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:33.800 
yeah warranty and we'll get rid of the
box

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.240 

so<00:03:34.350> now<00:03:34.500> we'll<00:03:34.830> crack<00:03:35.100> into<00:03:35.490> the<00:03:36.380> printer<00:03:37.380> it's

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
so now we'll crack into the printer it's

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.690 
so now we'll crack into the printer it's
nothing<00:03:38.640> special<00:03:38.970> but<00:03:39.210> I<00:03:40.010> don't<00:03:41.010> do<00:03:41.190> very<00:03:41.490> many

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
nothing special but I don't do very many

00:03:41.700 --> 00:04:00.080 
nothing special but I don't do very many
unboxings<00:03:42.690> so<00:03:52.970> light<00:03:54.680> really<00:03:55.680> light<00:03:59.090> let's

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
unboxings so light really light let's

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.150 
unboxings so light really light let's
see<00:04:00.330> how<00:04:00.510> much<00:04:00.720> weighs<00:04:01.080> actually<00:04:01.770> it<00:04:01.950> probably

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
see how much weighs actually it probably

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.720 
see how much weighs actually it probably
says<00:04:02.580> in<00:04:02.820> the<00:04:02.970> instruction<00:04:03.660> somewhere<00:04:04.230> but

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
says in the instruction somewhere but

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:13.430 
says in the instruction somewhere but
