 carbon fiber did not change anything see 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:03.590
 Negative distance such as large 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.029
 still you see the entry for comparison on 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.979
 do not worry about any hands 

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:10.039
 it will be clear that the final 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.990
 quality quality can be seen here clasps 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:14.270

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.729
 to level very light 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:22.639
 the first days when i started on them 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:25.879
 stabbing these tracks cocaine wheels are not 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:29.330
 Give true spin and all sorts of I just 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:33.610
 flew everything on the third and on 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:36.439
 the fourth day I'm just in shock I'm curing 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:39.349
 as I wanted and it turned out to 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:41.779
 pipe seize all that they have 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:45.430
 you go and not paris and in general just 

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:50.360
 slips once fit well on pipe 2 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:53.990
 your words distortion 3 here's what kind of steak 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:56.900
 see with them now 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:59.180
 everywhere just generally felt straight 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:02.660
 gel gel stuff here is very 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:05.810
 anti-shock more often wonderful as it were 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:08.660
 what I want to tell everyone who is afraid of cuts 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:13.160
 go on and everywhere or landfills but think 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:15.950
 so these videos do not believe anyone 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:20.300
 that they are tough it's not as if I and 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:23.270
 I don't ride much on the edges 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:26.780
 as if my own leg began 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.970
 pawned past top solu got up 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:32.030
 in general this is what they are not hard they 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:35.330
 even soft somewhere around 50 percent 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.280
 softness is the key to good at something on
