00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.209
 lousy acting but a wonderful 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:42.970
 writer your idea is simple 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.489
 grandiose set for the 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.430
 key scene in the film is also per 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.840
 daltons by closing again 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.280

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.799

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.139
 Daltons fly again I do not care 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.739

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.739
 dortmunds klop 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.460
 to come to the bottom 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:30.700
 so now we were one of those 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.100
 downright magical scene of little roman 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:39.820

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:41.980
 at the exit of the tunnel now again 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.830
 after we do not think of ourselves as a script 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.350
 no nobody in jail they are all 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.840
 outside we have our chance 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.770
 that means nobody will notice that we 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.600
 from 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.600
 you bring the matter to the point 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:59.610
 if they are not missing as we stopped 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:02.249
 what will i say to my audience 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:05.120
 but that is even better you will 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:08.069
 a rent from a living legend 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.840
 I think you are so beautiful 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:12.949
 To be true, there are even a few waiting 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.949
 horses on us 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:40.060

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.060

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:13.580
 with mood swings, it will never 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:14.960
 when that's it, the building is 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:20.050
 no one hurt anymore 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.050
