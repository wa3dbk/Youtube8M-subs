okay

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
okay

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.169 
okay
the<00:00:05.400> darker<00:00:05.819> we<00:00:05.970> can<00:00:06.120> make<00:00:06.270> it<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.540> better<00:00:06.720> so

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:08.179 
the darker we can make it the better so

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:09.379 
the darker we can make it the better so
okay

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
okay

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.310 
okay
oh<00:00:09.420> that's<00:00:09.929> got<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.230> window<00:00:10.530> shop<00:00:12.200> earlier<00:00:13.200> I

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
oh that's got a window shop earlier I

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.039 
oh that's got a window shop earlier I
said<00:00:13.380> that<00:00:13.769> if<00:00:13.980> we're<00:00:14.880> in<00:00:15.089> pyrolysis<00:00:15.540> there

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
said that if we're in pyrolysis there

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.260 
said that if we're in pyrolysis there
will<00:00:16.170> be<00:00:16.199> no<00:00:16.699> burning<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.029> paper

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
will be no burning of the paper

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.529 
will be no burning of the paper
underneath<00:00:18.779> their<00:00:19.109> work<00:00:19.439> biomass<00:00:20.070> relief<00:00:20.369> so

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.310 

I'll<00:00:24.539> make<00:00:24.720> some<00:00:25.019> smoke<00:00:25.230> first<00:00:25.910> so<00:00:26.910> here<00:00:27.449> this

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
I'll make some smoke first so here this

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.859 
I'll make some smoke first so here this
is<00:00:28.529> burning<00:00:28.769> because<00:00:29.250> we<00:00:29.460> have<00:00:29.640> oxygen<00:00:30.090> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
is burning because we have oxygen the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.540 
is burning because we have oxygen the
oxygen<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.529> combining<00:00:31.859> with<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.130> gases<00:00:32.489> that

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
oxygen is combining with the gases that

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.190 
oxygen is combining with the gases that
are<00:00:32.700> being<00:00:32.820> released<00:00:33.030> from<00:00:33.239> here<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.170> can

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
are being released from here and you can

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.290 
are being released from here and you can
see<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.500> make<00:00:34.680> smoke<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.280> make<00:00:35.550> some<00:00:35.760> combustion

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
see I make smoke I make some combustion

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.360 
see I make smoke I make some combustion
you<00:00:36.480> can<00:00:36.660> see<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.230> turning<00:00:37.469> into<00:00:37.680> some

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
you can see this is turning into some

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.970 
you can see this is turning into some
char<00:00:38.700> but<00:00:39.000> lots<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.420> ash<00:00:39.649> this<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.800> going<00:00:40.920> to

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
char but lots of ash this is going to

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.650 
char but lots of ash this is going to
have<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.129> very<00:00:41.399> high<00:00:41.550> pH<00:00:41.850> not<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:42.270> good<00:00:42.450> for<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
have a very high pH not so good for the

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:55.010 
have a very high pH not so good for the
soil<00:00:52.610> but<00:00:53.610> that's<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.000> advantage<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.480> biochar

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
soil but that's the advantage of biochar

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.750 
soil but that's the advantage of biochar
is<00:00:55.289> all<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.770> nutrition<00:00:56.280> that's<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.579> ash

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
is all the nutrition that's in ash

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.150 
is all the nutrition that's in ash
remains<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.539> biochar<00:00:57.960> but<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.530> pH<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.010> low

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
remains in the biochar but the pH is low

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
remains in the biochar but the pH is low
so<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.670> have<00:00:59.940> exactly<00:01:01.129> so<00:01:04.729> toss<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.090> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
so you have exactly so toss that in the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.990 
so you have exactly so toss that in the
center<00:01:06.510> down<00:01:06.960> below<00:01:07.320> yes<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.860> your<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.220> most

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
center down below yes is your the most

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.490 
center down below yes is your the most
active<00:01:09.420> participant<00:01:09.930> in<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.200> demonstration

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
active participant in this demonstration

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.420 
active participant in this demonstration
just<00:01:11.930> throw<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.140> but<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.010> can<00:01:14.189> see<00:01:14.369> it

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
just throw it in but so you can see it

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.280 
just throw it in but so you can see it
in<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.640> middle<00:01:14.850> drop<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.540> it's<00:01:15.750> down<00:01:16.110> there

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
in the middle drop it so it's down there

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.780 
in the middle drop it so it's down there
and<00:01:16.650> then<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:16.950> turned<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.250> light<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.729> can

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
and then I turned the light so you can

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.679 
and then I turned the light so you can
see<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.210> when<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.869> see<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.080> doesn't<00:01:19.470> ignite<00:01:20.689> it

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
see it when you see it doesn't ignite it

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.149 
see it when you see it doesn't ignite it
just<00:01:21.900> sits<00:01:22.110> there<00:01:22.200> slowly<00:01:22.560> turning<00:01:22.890> black

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
just sits there slowly turning black

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:35.859 
just sits there slowly turning black
without<00:01:23.520> bursting<00:01:23.909> into<00:01:24.210> flames

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.539 

so<00:01:37.700> again<00:01:39.049> because<00:01:40.049> he<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.409> think<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.310> didn't

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
so again because he I think you didn't

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.160 
so again because he I think you didn't
get<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.729> see<00:01:41.880> yeah<00:01:42.330> you<00:01:42.360> didn't<00:01:42.810> get<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.930> chance

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
get to see yeah you didn't get a chance

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:51.770 
get to see yeah you didn't get a chance
you<00:01:43.740> only<00:01:44.190> saw<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.490> very<00:01:44.700> end<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:50.780> where

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
you only saw the very end of it so where

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:12.390 
you only saw the very end of it so where
is<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.070> there<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.130> is

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.660 

yeah<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.550> small<00:02:13.820> pieces<00:02:14.060> take<00:02:14.420> small<00:02:14.720> pieces

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
yeah the small pieces take small pieces

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.820 
yeah the small pieces take small pieces
now<00:02:16.670> that<00:02:16.880> that<00:02:17.090> has<00:02:17.270> wet<00:02:17.570> so<00:02:18.350> go<00:02:18.500> ahead<00:02:18.650> and

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
now that that has wet so go ahead and

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.680 
now that that has wet so go ahead and
see<00:02:18.920> what<00:02:19.070> happens<00:02:19.370> it<00:02:20.090> might<00:02:20.300> make<00:02:20.480> more

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
see what happens it might make more

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.860 
see what happens it might make more
smoke<00:02:20.990> right<00:02:22.180> or<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.390> flame<00:02:23.690> temperature

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
smoke right or the flame temperature

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.740 
smoke right or the flame temperature
will<00:02:24.230> drop<00:02:24.350> so<00:02:24.560> you'll<00:02:24.680> get<00:02:24.770> more<00:02:24.830> orange

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
will drop so you'll get more orange

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.670 
will drop so you'll get more orange
because<00:02:26.750> you're<00:02:26.900> getting<00:02:27.020> rid<00:02:27.320> of<00:02:27.410> all<00:02:27.530> that

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
because you're getting rid of all that

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.040 
because you're getting rid of all that
moisture<00:02:28.810> right<00:02:29.810> yeah<00:02:30.470> and<00:02:31.600> then<00:02:32.600> they<00:02:32.750> spent

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
moisture right yeah and then they spent

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.880 
moisture right yeah and then they spent
the<00:02:33.170> rest<00:02:33.320> of<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.709> day<00:02:33.920> tossing<00:02:34.670> things<00:02:34.910> in

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
the rest of the day tossing things in

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.729 
the rest of the day tossing things in
nobody<00:02:36.890> got<00:02:37.100> any<00:02:37.250> work<00:02:37.550> done<00:02:38.410> but<00:02:39.410> they<00:02:39.530> had<00:02:39.709> a

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
nobody got any work done but they had a

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:47.710 
nobody got any work done but they had a
grand<00:02:40.010> old<00:02:40.160> time<00:02:40.280> so<00:02:45.790> now<00:02:46.790> you've<00:02:46.910> seen<00:02:46.940> you've

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
grand old time so now you've seen you've

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.860 
grand old time so now you've seen you've
the<00:02:48.470> water<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:49.160> water<00:02:49.370> in<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.910> grapes<00:02:50.300> is

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
the water the water in the grapes is

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.570 
the water the water in the grapes is
releasing<00:02:51.320> and<00:02:51.709> so<00:02:51.920> you've<00:02:52.070> created<00:02:52.220> an

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
releasing and so you've created an

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.070 
releasing and so you've created an
unstable<00:02:53.030> flame<00:02:53.360> because<00:02:53.600> you're<00:02:53.720> having<00:02:53.870> to

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
unstable flame because you're having to

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.650 
unstable flame because you're having to
release<00:02:54.290> a<00:02:54.320> lot<00:02:54.590> of<00:02:54.620> water<00:02:54.970> once<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.269> water<00:02:56.540> is

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
release a lot of water once the water is

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.090 
release a lot of water once the water is
driven<00:02:56.989> out<00:02:57.140> then<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.620> flame<00:02:57.830> will<00:02:58.010> be

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
driven out then the flame will be

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.820 
driven out then the flame will be
stabilized<00:02:58.580> and<00:02:58.910> it<00:02:59.060> keeps<00:02:59.300> going

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.070 

so<00:03:03.370> it's<00:03:03.550> actually<00:03:03.670> quite<00:03:04.150> possible<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:04.810> put

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
so it's actually quite possible to put

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.040 
so it's actually quite possible to put
in<00:03:05.200> that<00:03:05.370> leaves<00:03:06.370> just<00:03:06.610> so<00:03:07.330> long<00:03:07.570> as<00:03:07.750> it's<00:03:07.900> not

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
in that leaves just so long as it's not

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.020 
in that leaves just so long as it's not
the<00:03:08.230> whole<00:03:08.430> absolutely

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.850 

so<00:03:12.810> how<00:03:12.930> long<00:03:13.080> have<00:03:13.230> we<00:03:13.260> been<00:03:13.470> going<00:03:13.650> has

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
so how long have we been going has

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.449 
so how long have we been going has
anyone<00:03:14.160> tamed<00:03:14.400> it

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.240 

okay<00:03:20.459> so<00:03:20.670> half<00:03:20.880> an<00:03:21.000> hour<00:03:21.120> so<00:03:22.130> remember<00:03:23.130> earlier

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
okay so half an hour so remember earlier

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.850 
okay so half an hour so remember earlier
I<00:03:23.640> showed<00:03:23.760> you<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.300> piece<00:03:24.540> of<00:03:24.660> wood<00:03:24.780> yes<00:03:25.620> and

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
I showed you the piece of wood yes and

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.610 
I showed you the piece of wood yes and
you<00:03:26.400> guys<00:03:26.580> said<00:03:26.819> maybe<00:03:27.030> five<00:03:27.330> 15<00:03:28.080> minutes<00:03:28.410> for

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
you guys said maybe five 15 minutes for

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.210 
you guys said maybe five 15 minutes for
burning<00:03:28.890> that<00:03:29.069> right<00:03:30.000> so<00:03:30.540> we've<00:03:30.690> gone<00:03:31.100> half<00:03:32.100> an

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
burning that right so we've gone half an

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:42.020 
burning that right so we've gone half an
hour<00:03:38.959> I'm<00:03:39.959> sorry<00:03:40.200> we<00:03:40.260> can<00:03:40.410> keep<00:03:40.530> going<00:03:40.590> but<00:03:41.030> at

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
hour I'm sorry we can keep going but at

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.900 
hour I'm sorry we can keep going but at
this<00:03:42.239> point<00:03:42.510> we<00:03:43.350> could<00:03:43.530> empty<00:03:43.830> it<00:03:44.010> if<00:03:44.670> you<00:03:44.790> have

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
this point we could empty it if you have

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.699 
this point we could empty it if you have
a<00:03:44.940> big<00:03:45.150> tray<00:03:45.420> and<00:03:45.660> we<00:03:45.780> can<00:03:45.930> show<00:03:46.140> you<00:03:46.200> how<00:03:46.560> much

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
a big tray and we can show you how much

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.920 
a big tray and we can show you how much
biochar<00:03:47.310> there<00:03:47.459> is<00:03:47.580> in<00:03:47.790> how<00:03:48.330> much<00:03:48.450> fuel<00:03:48.810> we

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
biochar there is in how much fuel we

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.979 
biochar there is in how much fuel we
haven't<00:03:49.230> used<00:03:49.380> I<00:03:50.160> can<00:03:50.670> quench<00:03:50.910> it<00:03:51.150> then<00:03:51.690> we<00:03:51.840> can

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
haven't used I can quench it then we can

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:59.740 
haven't used I can quench it then we can
see<00:03:52.200> what<00:03:52.350> else<00:03:52.470> happens<00:03:54.320> absolutely

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.240 

she<00:04:00.750> keeps<00:04:00.989> coming<00:04:01.200> out<00:04:01.440> of<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.680> office<00:04:02.010> near

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
she keeps coming out of the office near

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.600 
she keeps coming out of the office near
the<00:04:02.489> fire<00:04:02.730> ooh<00:04:03.590> that<00:04:04.590> one<00:04:04.739> will<00:04:04.950> suffocate<00:04:05.370> it

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
the fire ooh that one will suffocate it

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.390 
the fire ooh that one will suffocate it
I'd<00:04:05.760> try<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:06.450> make<00:04:06.569> it<00:04:06.810> smaller<00:04:07.290> week<00:04:07.830> or<00:04:08.310> you

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
I'd try and make it smaller week or you

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:16.819 
I'd try and make it smaller week or you
could<00:04:08.550> get<00:04:08.700> a<00:04:08.730> bigger<00:04:08.970> Lucia's<00:04:09.420> oh<00:04:15.829> the

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
could get a bigger Lucia's oh the

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.469 
could get a bigger Lucia's oh the
largest<00:04:17.220> one<00:04:17.340> we've<00:04:17.549> made<00:04:17.760> is<00:04:17.970> over<00:04:18.269> 1

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
largest one we've made is over 1

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.930 
largest one we've made is over 1
megawatt<00:04:18.780> which<00:04:19.290> uses<00:04:19.650> 500<00:04:20.190> kilos<00:04:20.459> of<00:04:20.609> biomass

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
megawatt which uses 500 kilos of biomass

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.780 
megawatt which uses 500 kilos of biomass
an<00:04:21.090> hour<00:04:21.209> also<00:04:22.200> to<00:04:22.800> give<00:04:22.979> you<00:04:23.010> a<00:04:23.160> sense<00:04:23.460> they're

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
an hour also to give you a sense they're

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:35.620 
an hour also to give you a sense they're
a<00:04:23.910> couple<00:04:24.120> flat<00:04:24.990> packs<00:04:25.410> on<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.770> on<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.400> table

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.180 

that<00:04:36.630> one<00:04:36.870> was<00:04:37.080> done<00:04:37.410> specifically<00:04:38.070> to

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
that one was done specifically to

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.080 
that one was done specifically to
produce<00:04:38.490> lots<00:04:39.150> of<00:04:39.330> biotech<00:04:39.810> but<00:04:40.530> so<00:04:41.100> this<00:04:41.880> will

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
produce lots of biotech but so this will

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.800 
produce lots of biotech but so this will
actually<00:04:42.240> answer<00:04:42.600> your<00:04:42.990> original<00:04:43.020> question

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
actually answer your original question

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.950 
actually answer your original question
now<00:04:45.810> track<00:04:46.140> sure<00:04:46.380> because<00:04:46.560> of<00:04:46.710> the<00:04:46.830> leaf<00:04:47.960> this

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
now track sure because of the leaf this

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.920 
now track sure because of the leaf this
is<00:04:49.140> this<00:04:49.560> is<00:04:49.740> a<00:04:49.770> regular<00:04:50.220> reaches<00:04:50.550> Donna<00:04:50.930> so

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
is this is a regular reaches Donna so

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.190 
is this is a regular reaches Donna so
the<00:04:52.260> top<00:04:52.500> plate<00:04:52.770> has<00:04:53.400> a<00:04:53.430> bigger<00:04:53.880> hole<00:04:54.120> and<00:04:54.419> the

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
the top plate has a bigger hole and the

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.900 
the top plate has a bigger hole and the
spirals<00:04:55.680> are<00:04:55.860> dictated<00:04:56.310> by<00:04:56.460> a<00:04:56.490> different

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
spirals are dictated by a different

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.500 
spirals are dictated by a different
shape<00:04:57.150> so<00:04:58.610> that's<00:04:59.610> three<00:05:00.180> and<00:05:00.210> a<00:05:00.360> half

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
shape so that's three and a half

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:12.119 
shape so that's three and a half
kilowatts<00:05:02.960> that<00:05:03.960> is<00:05:04.140> made<00:05:04.320> with<00:05:04.350> 28<00:05:05.070> soda<00:05:05.280> cans

00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:12.129 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:18.209 

yes<00:05:15.809> so<00:05:16.809> that's<00:05:17.110> why<00:05:17.319> I<00:05:17.349> like<00:05:17.589> just<00:05:17.860> using<00:05:18.159> a

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:18.219 
yes so that's why I like just using a

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:20.820 
yes so that's why I like just using a
can<00:05:18.429> or<00:05:18.699> whatever<00:05:19.029> it<00:05:19.239> will<00:05:19.569> be<00:05:19.649> you'll<00:05:20.649> hit

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
can or whatever it will be you'll hit

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.820 
can or whatever it will be you'll hit
your<00:05:20.909> efficiency<00:05:21.909> will<00:05:22.029> drop<00:05:22.059> a<00:05:22.509> lot<00:05:22.899> but<00:05:23.679> I

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
your efficiency will drop a lot but I

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.889 
your efficiency will drop a lot but I
mean<00:05:23.979> you<00:05:24.069> can<00:05:24.219> certainly<00:05:24.369> do<00:05:24.669> it<00:05:24.819> I<00:05:24.969> mean<00:05:25.360> this

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:25.899 
mean you can certainly do it I mean this

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:28.139 
mean you can certainly do it I mean this
is<00:05:26.080> the<00:05:26.199> bottom<00:05:26.529> so<00:05:27.279> the<00:05:27.399> air<00:05:27.580> comes<00:05:27.819> in<00:05:27.999> just

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:28.149 
is the bottom so the air comes in just

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:30.749 
is the bottom so the air comes in just
like<00:05:28.330> on<00:05:28.509> that<00:05:28.689> but<00:05:29.649> then<00:05:29.919> you<00:05:30.369> can<00:05:30.519> do<00:05:30.639> an

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759 
like on that but then you can do an

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:37.649 
like on that but then you can do an
added<00:05:31.269> feature<00:05:31.569> this<00:05:32.019> is<00:05:32.080> 14<00:05:32.589> cans<00:05:32.860> so<00:05:35.819> so<00:05:36.819> lots

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:37.659 
added feature this is 14 cans so so lots

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:44.040 
added feature this is 14 cans so so lots
of<00:05:37.779> gas<00:05:38.429> let's<00:05:39.429> guess<00:05:42.509> that's<00:05:43.509> a<00:05:43.629> regulator

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
of gas let's guess that's a regulator

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.290 
of gas let's guess that's a regulator
and<00:05:44.229> you<00:05:44.319> can<00:05:44.469> see<00:05:44.709> this<00:05:45.159> is<00:05:45.369> a<00:05:45.399> larger<00:05:45.849> hole<00:05:46.029> so

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
and you can see this is a larger hole so

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.989 
and you can see this is a larger hole so
you<00:05:46.360> could<00:05:46.569> put<00:05:46.749> your<00:05:46.869> large<00:05:47.110> leaf<00:05:47.319> in<00:05:47.499> that

00:05:47.989 --> 00:05:47.999 
you could put your large leaf in that

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:50.699 
you could put your large leaf in that
and<00:05:48.999> then<00:05:49.629> from<00:05:49.899> country<00:05:50.199> to<00:05:50.229> country<00:05:50.349> you

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:50.709 
and then from country to country you

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:52.949 
and then from country to country you
have<00:05:50.889> to<00:05:51.039> change<00:05:51.279> what<00:05:51.819> happens<00:05:52.149> because<00:05:52.389> to

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:52.959 
have to change what happens because to

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:55.290 
have to change what happens because to
make<00:05:53.110> the<00:05:53.229> stove<00:05:53.469> acceptable<00:05:54.099> you<00:05:55.029> can't

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
make the stove acceptable you can't

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.999 
make the stove acceptable you can't
force<00:05:55.659> people<00:05:55.719> to<00:05:56.019> adapt<00:05:56.319> to<00:05:56.349> a<00:05:56.499> technology

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:57.009 
force people to adapt to a technology

00:05:57.009 --> 00:05:58.259 
force people to adapt to a technology
you<00:05:57.159> need<00:05:57.279> the<00:05:57.399> technology<00:05:57.909> will<00:05:58.029> adapt<00:05:58.240> to

00:05:58.259 --> 00:05:58.269 
you need the technology will adapt to

00:05:58.269 --> 00:06:02.009 
you need the technology will adapt to
the<00:05:58.479> people<00:05:59.099> in<00:06:00.099> Ethiopia<00:06:00.699> for<00:06:00.729> example<00:06:01.269> they

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:02.019 
the people in Ethiopia for example they

00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:05.519 
the people in Ethiopia for example they
don't<00:06:02.139> use<00:06:02.349> a<00:06:02.379> pot<00:06:03.029> they<00:06:04.029> use<00:06:04.269> a<00:06:04.689> meat<00:06:04.959> ad<00:06:05.139> which

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:05.529 
don't use a pot they use a meat ad which

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:09.809 
don't use a pot they use a meat ad which
is<00:06:05.679> a<00:06:05.709> flat<00:06:06.399> clay<00:06:06.909> plate<00:06:07.269> like<00:06:07.479> a<00:06:07.509> plancha<00:06:08.819> but

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:09.819 
is a flat clay plate like a plancha but

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:13.649 
is a flat clay plate like a plancha but
if<00:06:09.939> I<00:06:10.029> put<00:06:10.239> it<00:06:10.379> like<00:06:11.789> a<00:06:12.789> disc<00:06:13.059> of<00:06:13.209> clay<00:06:13.419> about

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:13.659 
if I put it like a disc of clay about

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:16.230 
if I put it like a disc of clay about
the<00:06:13.989> size<00:06:14.199> of<00:06:14.319> that<00:06:14.379> clock<00:06:14.649> so<00:06:15.459> but<00:06:15.909> if<00:06:15.999> I<00:06:16.089> were

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
the size of that clock so but if I were

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.629 
the size of that clock so but if I were
to<00:06:16.360> put<00:06:16.539> that<00:06:16.689> here<00:06:16.959> I<00:06:17.139> would<00:06:17.949> have<00:06:18.099> a<00:06:18.129> very<00:06:18.339> hot

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 
to put that here I would have a very hot

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:22.649 
to put that here I would have a very hot
spot<00:06:18.789> here<00:06:19.209> and<00:06:19.360> very<00:06:19.929> cold<00:06:20.169> here<00:06:20.559> so<00:06:21.659> to

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:22.659 
spot here and very cold here so to

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:25.169 
spot here and very cold here so to
modify<00:06:23.079> it<00:06:23.369> we<00:06:24.369> can<00:06:24.519> either<00:06:24.669> change<00:06:24.969> the

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:25.179 
modify it we can either change the

00:06:25.179 --> 00:06:27.899 
modify it we can either change the
curves<00:06:25.389> there<00:06:25.569> or<00:06:25.779> add<00:06:25.959> a<00:06:25.990> component<00:06:26.909> by

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:27.909 
curves there or add a component by

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:29.999 
curves there or add a component by
adding<00:06:28.300> this<00:06:28.389> component<00:06:28.959> the<00:06:29.319> flame<00:06:29.589> instead

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:30.009 
adding this component the flame instead

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:31.619 
adding this component the flame instead
of<00:06:30.099> being<00:06:30.309> a<00:06:30.399> spiral<00:06:30.909> that<00:06:30.939> goes<00:06:31.149> up<00:06:31.329> it's<00:06:31.539> a

00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:31.629 
of being a spiral that goes up it's a

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:33.839 
of being a spiral that goes up it's a
spiral<00:06:31.869> that<00:06:32.139> goes<00:06:32.289> out<00:06:32.499> and<00:06:33.129> so<00:06:33.309> it<00:06:33.429> heats<00:06:33.579> the

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:33.849 
spiral that goes out and so it heats the

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:36.929 
spiral that goes out and so it heats the
whole<00:06:34.059> play<00:06:34.360> uniformly<00:06:35.079> so<00:06:35.829> this<00:06:36.579> way<00:06:36.789> the

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:36.939 
whole play uniformly so this way the

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:39.089 
whole play uniformly so this way the
person<00:06:37.089> who's<00:06:37.419> using<00:06:37.479> the<00:06:37.869> stove<00:06:38.079> says<00:06:38.439> it

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:39.099 
person who's using the stove says it

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:41.759 
person who's using the stove says it
works<00:06:39.819> the<00:06:40.149> way<00:06:40.269> my<00:06:40.479> stove<00:06:40.779> works<00:06:41.019> it<00:06:41.379> cooks

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:41.769 
works the way my stove works it cooks

00:06:41.769 --> 00:06:43.379 
works the way my stove works it cooks
the<00:06:41.889> way<00:06:42.069> my<00:06:42.249> stove<00:06:42.490> works<00:06:42.729> it<00:06:42.939> doesn't<00:06:43.269> make

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:43.389 
the way my stove works it doesn't make

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:46.439 
the way my stove works it doesn't make
smoke<00:06:43.659> I'm<00:06:43.990> willing<00:06:44.319> to<00:06:44.379> accept<00:06:44.769> it<00:06:45.240> if<00:06:46.240> it's

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:46.449 
smoke I'm willing to accept it if it's

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:49.259 
smoke I'm willing to accept it if it's
forcing<00:06:46.809> yeah<00:06:47.619> if<00:06:47.829> it<00:06:47.979> says<00:06:48.219> you<00:06:48.759> have<00:06:48.969> to<00:06:48.999> give

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:49.269 
forcing yeah if it says you have to give

00:06:49.269 --> 00:06:50.639 
forcing yeah if it says you have to give
up<00:06:49.389> your<00:06:49.509> cooking<00:06:49.839> traditions<00:06:50.259> you<00:06:50.379> can't

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:50.649 
up your cooking traditions you can't

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:52.529 
up your cooking traditions you can't
cook<00:06:50.769> your<00:06:50.949> recipes<00:06:51.429> no<00:06:52.059> one<00:06:52.240> will<00:06:52.419> ever

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:52.539 
cook your recipes no one will ever

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:59.719 
cook your recipes no one will ever
expect<00:06:53.019> it<00:06:56.969> that's<00:06:57.969> right<00:06:58.240> absolutely

00:06:59.719 --> 00:06:59.729 
expect it that's right absolutely

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:02.879 
expect it that's right absolutely
absolutely<00:07:00.729> because<00:07:01.589> it's<00:07:02.589> a<00:07:02.679> sign<00:07:02.860> of

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:02.889 
absolutely because it's a sign of

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:05.759 
absolutely because it's a sign of
respect<00:07:03.629> and<00:07:04.629> in<00:07:04.749> an<00:07:04.869> emergency<00:07:05.229> setting<00:07:05.619> like

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:05.769 
respect and in an emergency setting like

00:07:05.769 --> 00:07:07.829 
respect and in an emergency setting like
Haiti<00:07:05.979> where<00:07:06.729> people<00:07:06.999> have<00:07:07.119> lost<00:07:07.300> their<00:07:07.569> jobs

00:07:07.829 --> 00:07:07.839 
Haiti where people have lost their jobs

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:10.069 
Haiti where people have lost their jobs
their<00:07:08.110> house<00:07:08.379> and<00:07:08.709> members<00:07:09.159> of<00:07:09.309> their<00:07:09.399> family

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:10.079 
their house and members of their family

00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:12.269 
their house and members of their family
to<00:07:11.079> tell<00:07:11.259> them<00:07:11.439> they<00:07:11.529> also<00:07:11.679> have<00:07:11.860> to<00:07:11.979> give<00:07:12.129> up

00:07:12.269 --> 00:07:12.279 
to tell them they also have to give up

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:13.780 
to tell them they also have to give up
their<00:07:12.399> traditions

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:13.790 
their traditions

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.940 
their traditions
it's<00:07:14.060> it's<00:07:14.540> an<00:07:14.690> arrogance<00:07:15.200> that<00:07:15.290> we<00:07:15.560> can't

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:15.950 
it's it's an arrogance that we can't

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.430 
it's it's an arrogance that we can't
permit<00:07:16.610> so<00:07:17.120> you<00:07:17.210> asked<00:07:17.420> about<00:07:17.480> scaling<00:07:17.990> right

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:18.440 
permit so you asked about scaling right

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.540 
permit so you asked about scaling right
it<00:07:18.590> was<00:07:18.680> you<00:07:18.830> or<00:07:19.420> you<00:07:20.420> grant<00:07:21.350> okay<00:07:21.890> so<00:07:21.950> this<00:07:22.250> is

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:22.550 
it was you or you grant okay so this is

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.920 
it was you or you grant okay so this is
three-and-a-half<00:07:23.120> kilowatts<00:07:25.360> this<00:07:26.360> is<00:07:26.510> 100

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:26.930 
three-and-a-half kilowatts this is 100

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:31.330 
three-and-a-half kilowatts this is 100
kilowatts<00:07:29.380> well<00:07:30.380> I<00:07:30.410> had<00:07:30.620> to<00:07:30.770> make<00:07:30.890> it<00:07:31.040> stronger

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:31.340 
kilowatts well I had to make it stronger

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.550 
kilowatts well I had to make it stronger
because<00:07:31.580> this<00:07:31.850> at<00:07:32.330> that<00:07:32.600> temperature<00:07:32.960> it<00:07:33.440> gets

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:33.560 
because this at that temperature it gets

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.790 
because this at that temperature it gets
too<00:07:33.830> hot<00:07:34.010> but<00:07:34.900> but<00:07:35.900> the<00:07:36.020> shape<00:07:36.260> is<00:07:36.410> almost

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 
too hot but but the shape is almost

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.950 
too hot but but the shape is almost
society<00:07:37.340> saying<00:07:37.580> the<00:07:38.060> size<00:07:38.270> is<00:07:38.540> almost<00:07:38.810> the

society saying the size is almost the

society saying the size is almost the
same<00:07:39.140> the<00:07:39.950> curves<00:07:40.250> are<00:07:40.490> a<00:07:40.520> little<00:07:40.640> different

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:44.950 

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:49.180 

another<00:07:45.950> difference<00:07:46.310> is<00:07:46.750> in<00:07:47.750> full<00:07:48.170> power<00:07:48.410> this

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:49.190 
another difference is in full power this

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:51.460 
will heat a liter in about ten minutes

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:55.540 
will heat a liter in about ten minutes
