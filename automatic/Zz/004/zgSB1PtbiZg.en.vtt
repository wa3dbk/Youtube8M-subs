00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
course we researched because it's very

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.470

important<00:03:51.770> to<00:03:51.830> feel<00:03:51.920> safe<00:03:52.190> and<00:03:52.460> I<00:03:53.060> last<00:03:53.240> effort

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
important to feel safe and I last effort

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.300 
important to feel safe and I last effort
so<00:03:53.660> we<00:03:53.750> did<00:03:53.900> a<00:03:53.930> lot<00:03:54.080> of<00:03:54.110> research<00:03:54.290> and<00:03:54.680> we<00:03:55.130> feel
