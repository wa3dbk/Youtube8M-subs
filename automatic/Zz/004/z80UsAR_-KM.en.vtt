telling<00:02:59.310> me<00:02:59.519> to<00:02:59.760> get<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.239> t2i<00:03:00.920> it's<00:03:01.920> like<00:03:02.280> the

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
telling me to get the t2i it's like the

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.850 
telling me to get the t2i it's like the
Canon<00:03:03.180> 550d<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:05.760> UK<00:03:06.299> term<00:03:07.290> but<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:07.620> guess

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
Canon 550d and the UK term but I guess

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.100 
Canon 550d and the UK term but I guess
it<00:03:08.040> in<00:03:08.220> America<00:03:08.910> it's<00:03:09.030> called<00:03:10.850> t2i<00:03:11.850> and<00:03:12.299> I

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
it in America it's called t2i and I

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.250 
it in America it's called t2i and I
guess<00:03:13.320> it's<00:03:13.500> it's<00:03:13.860> more<00:03:14.220> towards<00:03:14.549> like<00:03:15.260> actual

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
guess it's it's more towards like actual

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.979 
guess it's it's more towards like actual
like<00:03:16.590> picture<00:03:17.190> taking<00:03:17.580> camera<00:03:17.940> not<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.209> video

the<00:03:26.370> quality<00:03:26.760> of<00:03:26.850> it<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:27.690> looks<00:03:28.019> amazing

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550 
that and then we really weren't because

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.989 
that and then we really weren't because
there<00:06:41.699> wasn't<00:06:41.999> a<00:06:42.060> respawn<00:06:42.449> delay<00:06:42.749> and<00:06:42.990> then<00:06:43.999> we
