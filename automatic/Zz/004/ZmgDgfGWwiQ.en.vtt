do<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.229> sell<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.590> aircraft<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.100> take<00:01:11.280> this

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
do I sell this aircraft and take this

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.890 
do I sell this aircraft and take this
profit<00:01:11.850> how<00:01:12.180> do<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.360> replace<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
profit how do I replace in the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.630 
profit how do I replace in the
marketplace<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.619> can't<00:01:13.979> go<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.220> buy<00:01:14.280> another

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
marketplace I can't go and buy another

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.350 
marketplace I can't go and buy another
one<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.240> next<00:01:15.570> spot<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:16.310> 2017<00:01:17.310> second<00:01:17.939> quarter

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
one the next spot is 2017 second quarter
