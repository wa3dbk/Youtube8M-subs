00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
type of snowboard binding what we've got

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.440 
type of snowboard binding what we've got
is<00:00:40.100> the<00:00:41.100> tracks<00:00:41.430> binding<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.059> baseless

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
is the tracks binding is a baseless

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.000 
is the tracks binding is a baseless
binding<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.020> can<00:00:43.170> bolt<00:00:43.379> on<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
binding that you can bolt on to the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.440 
binding that you can bolt on to the
slider<00:00:44.789> track<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.690> has<00:00:46.610> four<00:00:47.610> hole<00:00:47.910> pattern

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
slider track it has four hole pattern

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.959 
slider track it has four hole pattern
here<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.680> bolts<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.219> outside<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
here that bolts to the outside of the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.490 
here that bolts to the outside of the
slider<00:00:51.210> truck<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.570> it's<00:00:51.690> very<00:00:51.840> stiff<00:00:52.289> and

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
slider truck so it's very stiff and

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.069 
slider truck so it's very stiff and
secure<00:00:52.949> here's<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:56.090> you<00:00:57.090> can<00:00:57.270> see<00:00:57.300> here<00:00:57.780> we

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
secure here's the you can see here we

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.900 
secure here's the you can see here we
provide<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.559> t-nuts<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.219> correct<00:00:59.550> screw

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
provide the t-nuts the correct screw

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.639 
provide the t-nuts the correct screw
length<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.390> it's<00:01:00.510> real<00:01:00.690> easy<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.140> adapt<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
length so it's real easy to adapt the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.450 
length so it's real easy to adapt the
binding<00:01:02.100> it's<00:01:02.250> it's<00:01:03.680> 199<00:01:04.680> retail<00:01:06.350> so<00:01:07.460> brings

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
binding it's it's 199 retail so brings

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.780 
binding it's it's 199 retail so brings
you<00:01:08.549> down<00:01:08.700> lower<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.439> the<00:01:10.439> deck<00:01:10.790> lighter

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
you down lower to the the deck lighter

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.030 
you down lower to the the deck lighter
weight<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.110> got<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> lot<00:01:13.439> more<00:01:13.470> performance

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
weight so you got a lot more performance

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.080 
weight so you got a lot more performance
on<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.280> up<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:15.330> down<00:01:16.880> there's<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.939> couple

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
on the up and the down there's a couple

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.850 
on the up and the down there's a couple
other<00:01:18.299> small<00:01:18.600> products<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.380> wanted<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.710> show

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
other small products I wanted to show

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.960 
other small products I wanted to show
you<00:01:19.890> two<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:21.840> dual<00:01:22.020> climbing<00:01:22.619> wire<00:01:22.970> it's

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
you two is the dual climbing wire it's

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.620 
you two is the dual climbing wire it's
let's<00:01:24.479> get<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.659> closer<00:01:24.900> look<00:01:25.020> at<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.470> here<00:01:26.630> we've

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
let's get a closer look at it here we've

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.420 
let's get a closer look at it here we've
put<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> plastic<00:01:28.409> coating<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:28.890> both<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.220> wires

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
put a plastic coating on both the wires

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.830 
put a plastic coating on both the wires
and<00:01:30.000> just<00:01:30.240> flip<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.600> wire<00:01:30.780> up<00:01:30.960> here<00:01:32.630> so<00:01:33.630> what

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
and just flip the wire up here so what

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
and just flip the wire up here so what
you<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.590> you've<00:01:35.430> got<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> 55<00:01:36.860> millimeter

more rotation while you're touring if

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.700 
more rotation while you're touring if
you've<00:01:50.189> got<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.369> really<00:01:50.610> large<00:01:50.850> boot<00:01:51.320> a<00:01:52.320> couple

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
you've got a really large boot a couple

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.370 
you've got a really large boot a couple
other<00:01:52.890> notable<00:01:53.570> updates<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.899> splitboard

other notable updates to the splitboard

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.719 
other notable updates to the splitboard
hardware<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:56.719> this<00:01:58.700> binding<00:01:59.700> stabilizer<00:02:00.329> it's

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
hardware is this binding stabilizer it's

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.899 
hardware is this binding stabilizer it's
basically<00:02:02.729> if<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.630> can<00:02:03.780> demonstrate<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.439> here

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
basically if I can demonstrate this here

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.240 
basically if I can demonstrate this here
one<00:02:05.909> second<00:02:06.500> let's<00:02:07.500> grab<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.770> light<00:02:08.039> rail

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
one second let's grab a light rail

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
one second let's grab a light rail
binding

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270

you see this tab at the back of the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.220 
you see this tab at the back of the
light<00:02:12.940> rail<00:02:13.150> binding<00:02:13.950> what<00:02:14.950> you'll<00:02:15.100> do<00:02:15.340> is

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
light rail binding what you'll do is

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.330 
light rail binding what you'll do is
typically<00:02:17.230> in<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.470> past<00:02:18.360> get<00:02:19.360> down<00:02:19.570> here<00:02:20.340> it

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
typically in the past get down here it

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.150
