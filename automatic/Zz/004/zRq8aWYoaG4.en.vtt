be able to affect this game on both

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.190 
be able to affect this game on both
sides<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.820> ball<00:01:32.970> coming<00:01:33.509> off<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.720> 75

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
sides of the ball coming off of 75

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.380 
sides of the ball coming off of 75
minutes<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.799> Wednesday<00:01:35.130> 90<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.030> previous

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
minutes and Wednesday 90 the previous

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.819 
minutes and Wednesday 90 the previous
weekend<00:01:36.750> yeah<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:36.960> don't<00:01:37.049> think<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.470> actually<00:01:37.590> I

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
weekend yeah I don't think so actually I

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.170 
weekend yeah I don't think so actually I
would<00:01:37.979> be<00:01:38.070> surprised<00:01:38.460> if<00:01:38.610> he<00:01:38.729> started<00:01:39.090> this

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
would be surprised if he started this

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.640 
would be surprised if he started this
game<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.020> middle<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.380> four

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
game this is in the middle of a four

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.999 
game this is in the middle of a four
games<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.250> 11<00:01:41.670> day<00:01:41.850> span<00:01:42.329> for<00:01:43.170> Sporting<00:01:43.470> KC<00:01:43.649> and

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
games in 11 day span for Sporting KC and

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.010 
games in 11 day span for Sporting KC and
I<00:01:44.280> think<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.610> big<00:01:44.850> one<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.119> going<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.689> be<00:01:45.869> on

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
I think the big one is going to be on

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.889 
I think the big one is going to be on
Wednesday<00:01:46.560> in<00:01:46.740> Mexico<00:01:47.369> City<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.210> it's<00:01:48.600> like<00:01:48.810> a

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
Wednesday in Mexico City so it's like a

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.810 
Wednesday in Mexico City so it's like a
leg<00:01:49.110> against<00:01:49.409> cruises<00:01:49.829> exactly<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.610> think

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
leg against cruises exactly so I think

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.359 
leg against cruises exactly so I think
Peter<00:01:51.210> Vermes<00:01:51.390> sits<00:01:51.869> fail<00:01:52.049> habra<00:01:52.409> tries<00:01:53.250> to

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
Peter Vermes sits fail habra tries to

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.429 
Peter Vermes sits fail habra tries to
keep<00:01:53.549> him<00:01:53.759> fresh<00:01:54.000> maybe<00:01:54.570> Mikey<00:01:54.899> Lopez<00:01:55.049> gets

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
keep him fresh maybe Mikey Lopez gets

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.050 
keep him fresh maybe Mikey Lopez gets
the<00:01:55.649> call<00:01:55.829> he<00:01:55.979> was<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.100> first-round<00:01:56.430> draft<00:01:56.850> pick

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
the call he was a first-round draft pick

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.789 
the call he was a first-round draft pick
last<00:01:57.299> year<00:01:57.450> didn't<00:01:57.899> play<00:01:58.140> at<00:01:58.290> all<00:01:58.409> but<00:01:58.619> maybe

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
last year didn't play at all but maybe

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.800 
last year didn't play at all but maybe
he's<00:01:59.009> ready<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.790> integrate<00:02:00.030> into<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.570> first

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
he's ready to integrate into the first

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.690 
he's ready to integrate into the first
team<00:02:00.960> maybe<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.770> young<00:02:01.950> Columbian<00:02:02.189> Jimmy

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
team maybe the young Columbian Jimmy

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.030 
team maybe the young Columbian Jimmy
Miranda<00:02:03.509> again<00:02:03.810> didn't<00:02:04.140> figure<00:02:04.469> much<00:02:04.740> at<00:02:04.920> all

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
Miranda again didn't figure much at all

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.940 
Miranda again didn't figure much at all
last<00:02:05.729> year<00:02:05.880> but<00:02:06.119> maybe<00:02:06.840> he's<00:02:07.079> with<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.560> system

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
last year but maybe he's with the system

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.460 
last year but maybe he's with the system
now<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:09.060> seems<00:02:09.360> early<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.989> have<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.349> be

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
now it seems early to have to be

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.110 
now it seems early to have to be
juggling<00:02:10.890> minutes<00:02:11.250> with<00:02:11.370> your<00:02:11.489> starters<00:02:11.940> but

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
juggling minutes with your starters but

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.850 
juggling minutes with your starters but
that's<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.840> price<00:02:12.989> you<00:02:13.080> pay

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
that's the price you pay

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.830 
that's the price you pay
when<00:02:14.250> you're<00:02:14.370> this<00:02:14.520> far<00:02:14.550> along<00:02:15.000> in<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.360> CCL

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
when you're this far along in the CCL

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.690 
when you're this far along in the CCL
and<00:02:16.050> by<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.560> way<00:02:16.740> sporting<00:02:17.160> wants<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.430> win<00:02:17.580> the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
and by the way sporting wants to win the

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.790 
and by the way sporting wants to win the
CCL<00:02:18.120> so<00:02:18.270> I<00:02:18.300> think<00:02:18.420> there<00:02:19.050> they're<00:02:19.500> willing<00:02:19.770> to

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
CCL so I think there they're willing to

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.470 
CCL so I think there they're willing to
compromise<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.460> little<00:02:20.580> bit<00:02:20.880> this<00:02:21.060> early<00:02:21.390> in

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
compromise a little bit this early in

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.000 
compromise a little bit this early in
the<00:02:21.510> regular<00:02:21.840> season<00:02:22.020> all<00:02:22.380> right<00:02:22.500> we'll<00:02:22.680> find

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
the regular season all right we'll find

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.040 
the regular season all right we'll find
