00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.110
 of sando that comes fifteenth sum so 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.750

 will try to follow a good run not to 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.560
 the 48 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.380
 maximiliano maximiliam mayer esta 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.210
 German football promise the player of 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.250
 18 years but who has rugby feel 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.540
 the offensive midfielder put the 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.270
 first so much at 51 I like to see the 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.729
 central factor by then 0 and 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.090
 tranquillo barnetta the former player of the 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:20.350
 leverkusen put the third as much in the 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.450
 85 minute had entered by 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.740
 one of the beautiful young promises that 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.270
 he had scored the first goal of the 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:31.119
 I met and played for example Jan Klass 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.960
 huntelaar the one that did not have that we did not see it 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:38.170
 today unfortunately the crack cracks 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.049
 dumb the midfielder to 10 the offensive 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.450
 it's a total crack that boy today does not 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.750
 He was among the starters and today he 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.450
 was among the holders to teo garcÃ­a 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.920
 would go to the elector of the inter 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:56.580
 choose the score of the juventus 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:00.450

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.369
 local team dissolved surpassed the 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.659
 match goals the first both the 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:09.959
 gum but should the offensive camper go 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.269
 the young man plays quite well and 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.519
 free enough fans whenever 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.500

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.110
 minutes of the second half a shot from 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.569
 left handed where it passed between his hands 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.739

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:38.190
 resistance from yesterday's auction a 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.200

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.019
 I entered the area I snatched 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.230
 cross it but that so you'll have to 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.840
 so that this rafael world costume that 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.120
 the goalkeeper missed the ball and 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.640
 allowed the visiting team to achieve in 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.940
 the first goal of the match and the second 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.670

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.660
 on the right 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:16.850
 the archer returns that the points that 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:19.040
 discarded is cristian pulse the lateral 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:23.750
 left that throws me the left center 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.940
 and appeared to see the center of the 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.100
 visiting team putting their head 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.960
 implacable spectacular the goal of head 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.640

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.650
 inferiors and is listening to the 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.300

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.930
 pretty spread by the kind of 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.080

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.980
 chances he had and he converted them from this 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.410
 way considered three points 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.880
 Schalke team not drexler
