00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello everyone with the facts for forest point fr 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.520
 today I present you was not old 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.199
 he disappears the doctor to play 

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:13.439
 percent of seniors to accentuate a little bit of 

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:15.099
 we have a little 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:18.800
 how to say honestly it's a little over 3000 that of 2008 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.010
 peugeot released 1,300 watchmen 299 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.019
 1 then to get bored under the noise 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.920
 it's the match right now 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.359
 supplied with their accessories to the box raised okay 

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:39.780
 philippe critics to do to the box 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.430
 so this is a fake generation diy debate my heart goes to its judges this 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.110
 something that protects 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.830
 once passed by here and here then here 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.430
 Most people 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.359
 % 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:53.230
 the private channel like that 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.970
 and this disc under the sea 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.180
 so 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.840
 it's not the best way at all because I knew that too 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.610
 so if you have something and it makes you believe 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.380
 good at first it's hard of the c5 it's a terroir that this little piece 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.960
 he's german the black they open this the celi embarrass the submarine or the 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.310
 everything in my voice at the bottom 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.670
 the 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:14.820
 its climbs 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.690
 after the album you get up 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.370
 so here I held because I was aware however you get up here 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.190
 falls 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.020
 when we do that 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.820
 understand like that and you'll see it if you do not expect 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.180
 all are waiting 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.090
 so that's it 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.650
 leaving strong room 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.000
 polyphony and 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.580
 what is regrettable is the manual which is really heavy 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.210
 really really why 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.400
 here too it's a small manual in several languages 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.350
 al-alam 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.350
 after we have an adapter 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.590
 like his brothers and sisters but that does not scare me 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.130
 50% 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.130
 I do not know I'll see it took 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.130
 the rsta deep every three points 5 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.500
 which has just been done 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.679
 who comes here for the big 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.390
 to help him a nice little broadcast 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.359
 because most of them 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:15.809
 that's what's chief 3 points 5 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:17.719
 skrela and that's a fact 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:18.750
 such a clause 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.569
 just 60 that's the 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.989
 the cable between the headphones and for the element that will send the sound 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.849
 as for me spain 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.279
 of course there was a boom boom 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:32.149
 too long painters 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:34.579
 I'm leaving, I'm using myself here 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:35.739
 blogolo 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.739
 I put my second camera 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.789
 for me 

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:44.099
 in his words 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.559
 so I take it 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:47.529
 maybe I should kind of helmet 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:49.729
 so with a harder mass 

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:51.639
 helmet 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:55.259
 this present in this box without this spa box and doctor to play 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.469
 finally this time 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:02:59.479
 who made 

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:01.029
 all that 

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:03.869
 in any case that October having manufactured a company 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:08.469
 cited a micro-enterprise April 2000 I leave them in places that in 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:09.809
 common like that's all 

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:12.989
 and then put on the floor of about ten employees 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.369
 this lack 

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:18.089
 end in his group 

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:19.489
 I am the most expensive model 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:20.889
 if I have no bullshit 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.009
 little steps for fear of playing me 

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:24.089
 e 

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:26.719
 you can buy imitations me I'm looking on the internet but these 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:28.019
 limitations 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.019
 so the German district I paid the price 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:31.959
 these last 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.649
 I was reimbursed of course 

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:37.809
 so do not play when you have a doubt not have time to play 

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:40.619
 for who follows 

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:44.029
 the best thing the wonderful thing on this track she would fall 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.289
 the cw chain 

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:50.099
 not a thin task is again 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.099
 here's 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:00.819
 right here 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.659
 we have since duracell 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:04.759
 to isolate 

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:07.629
 to feed the holland 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:10.229
 so for his holiness dirtyh like that 

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:13.229
 I thank you for being finally once again 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.519
 I am sorry 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.799
 but blocks that I'm doing it's really the case it's super good 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.799
 frankly I think of buying it 

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:28.469
 could put it back 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.590
 here we do not hide it from you 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.789
 it's a bit like seeing her 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:43.789
 here make the helmet then I show you 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:48.659
 like these the allowance to the children 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.349
 we always have the side 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:55.539
 at the level of the ads we have nothing to say at the design level 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:56.930
 why the number of years 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.900
 so not so sure 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.050
 the demand in china in canada 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.050
 to do this the leap to justice 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:08.139
 crazy laughs 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.430
 these cages will be mentioned here gold 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.430
 which is another part 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:17.319
 fountain will tell you why I bought I will not lie to you 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:20.370
 eugenes at all then someone in Bordeaux city 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.340
 eugenes kagame a chinese taking one and it pissed me off because 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.639
 that I told myself that it 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:29.020
 for the world cup I can buy me a what 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.919
 if you surprised me that a man alone about that 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.919
 I'm going to have it soon so that's it 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.090
 esa then I make you listen to people because like jeanne business quoted 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.939
 before I tell you what I regret to regret the 

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:43.189
 packing 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:45.559
 which is enough m 

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:48.400
 envied to do better for closed screening 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.689
 considering the closure 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:52.379
 so here I'm going to put you trade will put the economy 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:55.460
 collapses I put you the sense of small 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.210
 and then one day the man is like that with the camera we'll see what that 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.210
 give death 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:05.919
 I wanted to tell you that we had to open here 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:08.949
 and if the taste in the mouth 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:11.949
 so to hear you there it's in the middle 

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:20.009
 emerson and this time 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:24.409
 5 france 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:31.539
 in soccer at the 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.610
 so of 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.879
 this helmet it's really for the moment it's excellent 

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:40.059
 we have nothing to say level design the nivÃ´se 

00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:43.330
 quality of the show that he does not have against 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.349
 do not know it's me who have a headache 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:48.689
 but here I have a little my head of super g couple without child 

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:52.009
 I did the casting I do that where the heat is 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:54.259
 this was the little village 

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:56.189
 what is happening in the English club 

00:06:56.189 --> 00:06:59.059
 for 100 m 303 the fnac 

00:06:59.059 --> 00:07:02.029
 it's telling you next for a new debate there I left my 

00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:03.729
 comment on the discussions 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:06.470
 % and then here I am I will enjoy my headphones 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.289
 it's summer and we're going to have fun I think going 

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:11.680
 because in adoption can not go anywhere 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.099
 I would of course go 

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:16.770
 to hide them so that's why it's done for phase could do 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.830
 outsmart dia next for a little video where unpacking anything
