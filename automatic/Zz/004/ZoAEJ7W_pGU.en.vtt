00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
loss but it's pretty cool for the money

um<00:02:14.160> there's<00:02:14.940> some<00:02:15.090> issues<00:02:15.450> with<00:02:15.480> this<00:02:15.660> blade

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
um there's some issues with this blade

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.440 
um there's some issues with this blade
that<00:02:16.050> I<00:02:16.110> had<00:02:16.350> though<00:02:16.560> when<00:02:16.710> I<00:02:16.800> got<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.190> oh<00:02:17.450> yeah

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
that I had though when I got it oh yeah

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.230 
that I had though when I got it oh yeah
so<00:02:18.900> when<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:19.890> first<00:02:20.430> picked<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:20.820> up<00:02:20.970> I've

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
so when I first picked it up I've

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.320 
so when I first picked it up I've
noticed<00:02:21.540> inside<00:02:22.140> here<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.530> finger<00:02:22.770> hole<00:02:23.330> it

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
noticed inside here the finger hole it

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.930 
noticed inside here the finger hole it
was<00:02:24.510> really<00:02:24.720> sharp<00:02:25.110> with<00:02:25.520> that<00:02:26.520> I<00:02:26.550> guess<00:02:26.730> is<00:02:26.910> a

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
was really sharp with that I guess is a

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.960 
was really sharp with that I guess is a
g10<00:02:27.420> similar<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.710> so<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.460> just<00:02:29.640> sign<00:02:29.820> it

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
g10 similar to that so I just sign it

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.850 
g10 similar to that so I just sign it
down<00:02:30.260> smooth<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.380> out<00:02:31.500> because<00:02:31.710> it<00:02:31.800> was

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
down smooth it out because it was

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.280 
down smooth it out because it was
rubbing<00:02:32.310> on<00:02:32.430> my<00:02:32.580> finger<00:02:32.880> here<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.120> yeah<00:02:33.990> so

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
rubbing on my finger here and yeah so

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.350 
rubbing on my finger here and yeah so
that<00:02:34.470> had<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.650> be<00:02:34.770> fixed<00:02:35.130> another<00:02:36.060> thing<00:02:36.240> was

this<00:03:53.130> part<00:03:53.459> here<00:03:53.580> the<00:03:53.730> swoop<00:03:54.000> oblate<00:03:54.300> but<00:03:54.480> not

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
this part here the swoop oblate but not

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.420 
this part here the swoop oblate but not
towards<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:54.930> tip<00:03:55.170> i<00:03:55.440> might<00:03:55.950> just<00:03:55.980> take<00:03:56.220> it<00:03:56.400> to

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
towards a tip i might just take it to

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.990 
towards a tip i might just take it to
get<00:03:56.670> a<00:03:56.700> sharpen<00:03:57.390> just<00:03:57.840> to<00:03:57.930> see<00:03:58.110> how<00:03:58.230> it<00:03:58.350> fares

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
get a sharpen just to see how it fares

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.870

the<00:04:00.000> steel<00:04:00.830> it<00:04:01.830> said<00:04:02.130> right<00:04:02.340> here<00:04:02.370> what<00:04:02.640> it<00:04:02.730> was

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
the steel it said right here what it was

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.729 
the steel it said right here what it was
but<00:04:03.150> I<00:04:03.209> blackened<00:04:03.810> it<00:04:03.900> out<00:04:04.050> because<00:04:04.500> it<00:04:04.590> was

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
but I blackened it out because it was

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.740 
but I blackened it out because it was
kind<00:04:05.070> of<00:04:05.100> a<00:04:05.160> nuisance<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.580> see<00:04:05.790> it<00:04:05.910> I'm<00:04:06.600> not

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
kind of a nuisance to see it I'm not

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.870 
kind of a nuisance to see it I'm not
sure<00:04:07.050> the<00:04:07.470> numbers<00:04:07.739> are<00:04:07.920> you<00:04:08.610> can<00:04:08.730> see<00:04:08.850> that

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
sure the numbers are you can see that

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.720 
sure the numbers are you can see that
for<00:04:10.670> 417<00:04:11.670> I've<00:04:12.630> no<00:04:12.989> idea<00:04:13.200> what<00:04:13.410> that<00:04:13.440> is<00:04:13.730> the

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
for 417 I've no idea what that is the

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.260 
for 417 I've no idea what that is the
weights<00:04:14.970> really<00:04:15.330> light<00:04:15.510> at<00:04:15.780> all<00:04:15.840> of<00:04:16.020> a<00:04:16.080> scale

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.270 
weights really light at all of a scale

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:21.590 
weights really light at all of a scale
but<00:04:18.270> uh<00:04:18.299> we<00:04:19.290> see<00:04:19.470> in<00:04:19.680> comparison<00:04:20.600> obviously

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
but uh we see in comparison obviously

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.200 
but uh we see in comparison obviously
this<00:04:21.690> is<00:04:21.780> going<00:04:21.900> to<00:04:21.960> be<00:04:22.049> heavier<00:04:23.090> so<00:04:24.090> I<00:04:24.120> was
