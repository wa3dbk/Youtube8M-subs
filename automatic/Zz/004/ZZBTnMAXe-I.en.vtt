all<00:00:00.900> right<00:00:01.050> in<00:00:01.170> this<00:00:01.319> tutorial<00:00:01.740> I'm<00:00:01.800> going<00:00:01.920> to

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
all right in this tutorial I'm going to

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:03.320 
all right in this tutorial I'm going to
show<00:00:02.070> you<00:00:02.220> how<00:00:02.310> easy<00:00:02.610> it<00:00:02.760> is<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:03.060> build<00:00:03.179> a

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
show you how easy it is to build a

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.990 
show you how easy it is to build a
drag-and-drop<00:00:03.600> interaction<00:00:04.370> so<00:00:05.370> years<00:00:05.609> ago

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
drag-and-drop interaction so years ago

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.150 
drag-and-drop interaction so years ago
if<00:00:06.629> you<00:00:06.810> are<00:00:06.899> an<00:00:06.990> instructional<00:00:07.529> designer<00:00:07.890> and

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
if you are an instructional designer and

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.200 
if you are an instructional designer and
you<00:00:08.220> wanted<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.639> build<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.940> drag-and-drop

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
you wanted to build a drag-and-drop

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.660 
you wanted to build a drag-and-drop
interaction<00:00:09.809> you'd<00:00:10.710> either<00:00:10.860> require<00:00:11.400> that

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
interaction you'd either require that

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.400 
interaction you'd either require that
you<00:00:11.820> could<00:00:12.000> do<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.240> programming<00:00:12.840> for<00:00:13.110> it<00:00:13.230> or

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
you could do the programming for it or

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.169 
you could do the programming for it or
that<00:00:13.710> yet<00:00:13.889> access<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.519> person<00:00:14.880> who<00:00:15.000> could

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
that yet access to a person who could

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.300 
that yet access to a person who could
program<00:00:15.630> that<00:00:15.839> for<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.260> but<00:00:16.890> if<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.100> didn't

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
program that for you but if you didn't

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.830 
program that for you but if you didn't
have<00:00:17.400> those<00:00:17.609> skills<00:00:18.060> or<00:00:18.300> didn't<00:00:18.539> have<00:00:18.630> access

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
have those skills or didn't have access

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.200 
have those skills or didn't have access
to<00:00:19.230> those<00:00:19.350> resources<00:00:19.850> then<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:20.970> couldn't

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
to those resources then you couldn't

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.700 
to those resources then you couldn't
build<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.510> drag-and-drop<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.320> if<00:00:22.410> you're<00:00:22.529> an

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
build a drag-and-drop so if you're an

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.960 
build a drag-and-drop so if you're an
instructional<00:00:23.220> designer<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:23.850> were

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
instructional designer and you were

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.480 
instructional designer and you were
building<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.390> course<00:00:25.070> if<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.220> didn't<00:00:26.400> have

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
building a course if you didn't have

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.710 
building a course if you didn't have
those<00:00:26.580> resources<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.359> never<00:00:27.539> even

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
those resources you never even

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.810 
those resources you never even
considered<00:00:28.320> drag-and-drop<00:00:28.710> interactions<00:00:29.580> in

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
considered drag-and-drop interactions in

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.640 
considered drag-and-drop interactions in
the<00:00:30.300> development<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.960> your<00:00:31.019> course<00:00:31.410> and

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
the development of your course and

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.560 
the development of your course and
that's<00:00:32.279> what<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.430> think<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:32.940> cool<00:00:33.149> about<00:00:33.210> the

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
that's what I think is so cool about the

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.260 
that's what I think is so cool about the
industry<00:00:33.960> today<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:34.890> today<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.610> don't<00:00:35.940> need<00:00:36.180> to

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
industry today so today I don't need to

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.700 
industry today so today I don't need to
worry<00:00:36.450> about<00:00:36.660> whether<00:00:36.870> or<00:00:37.079> not<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.350> build<00:00:37.620> a

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
worry about whether or not I can build a

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.260 
worry about whether or not I can build a
drag-and-drop<00:00:37.980> because<00:00:38.610> I'll<00:00:38.700> show<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:39.000> you

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
drag-and-drop because I'll show you you

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.760 
drag-and-drop because I'll show you you
can<00:00:39.420> build<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.719> drag-and-drop<00:00:40.170> interaction

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
can build a drag-and-drop interaction

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.250 
can build a drag-and-drop interaction
and<00:00:41.309> really<00:00:42.090> just<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.390> couple<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.690> minutes<00:00:43.079> now

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
and really just a couple of minutes now

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.319 
and really just a couple of minutes now
the<00:00:43.710> question<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.430> okay<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.760> can<00:00:45.030> build<00:00:45.210> a

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
the question is okay I can build a

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.979 
the question is okay I can build a
drag-and-drop

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
drag-and-drop

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.619 
drag-and-drop
where<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.190> most<00:00:47.399> appropriate<00:00:47.700> time<00:00:48.329> for

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
where is the most appropriate time for

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.209 
where is the most appropriate time for
or<00:00:48.809> when<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.200> most<00:00:49.379> appropriate<00:00:49.680> time<00:00:49.890> for

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
or when is the most appropriate time for

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.819 
or when is the most appropriate time for
me<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.430> do<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:51.110> what<00:00:52.110> are<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.289> best<00:00:52.469> types<00:00:52.710> of

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
me to do that what are the best types of

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.170 
me to do that what are the best types of
interactions<00:00:53.460> what<00:00:53.610> are<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.760> best<00:00:53.910> learning

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
interactions what are the best learning

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.020 
interactions what are the best learning
experiences<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.140> can<00:00:55.710> craft<00:00:56.010> with<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.520> so

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
experiences I can craft with that so

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.549 
experiences I can craft with that so
instead<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.390> worrying<00:00:57.690> about<00:00:57.930> whether<00:00:58.320> or<00:00:58.500> not

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
instead of worrying about whether or not

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.450 
instead of worrying about whether or not
you<00:00:58.710> can<00:00:58.890> build<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.219> drag-and-drop

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
you can build a drag-and-drop

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.760 
you can build a drag-and-drop
interaction<00:01:00.059> now<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:00.960> can<00:01:01.289> begin<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
interaction now you can begin the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.189 
interaction now you can begin the
conversation<00:01:02.460> around<00:01:02.870> when<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:04.049> most

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
conversation around when it's most

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.109 
conversation around when it's most
appropriate<00:01:04.460> to<00:01:05.460> include<00:01:05.790> them<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.090> your

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
appropriate to include them in your

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.940 
appropriate to include them in your
course<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:07.229> tutorial<00:01:07.650> I'll<00:01:07.710> show<00:01:07.740> you

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
course in this tutorial I'll show you

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.649 
course in this tutorial I'll show you
how<00:01:08.130> easy<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.909> build<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.240> drag-and-drop

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
how easy it is to build a drag-and-drop

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.410 
how easy it is to build a drag-and-drop
so<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.110> can<00:01:10.290> see<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:11.159> walls<00:01:11.760> been<00:01:12.119> torn

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
so you can see that that walls been torn

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.960 
so you can see that that walls been torn
down<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:13.350> what<00:01:13.710> we<00:01:13.830> have<00:01:14.040> here<00:01:14.070> right<00:01:14.549> now<00:01:14.760> is

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
down so what we have here right now is

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.780 
down so what we have here right now is
basically<00:01:15.420> just<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.840> slide<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:16.979> if<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.250> preview

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
basically just the slide so if I preview

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.660 
basically just the slide so if I preview
this<00:01:17.939> slide<00:01:18.650> it's<00:01:19.650> just<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.040> static<00:01:20.460> slide

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
this slide it's just a static slide

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.570 
this slide it's just a static slide
there's<00:01:20.909> nothing<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.479> there's<00:01:21.840> nothing

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
there's nothing on it there's nothing

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.920 
there's nothing on it there's nothing
unique<00:01:23.580> about<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:24.119> slide<00:01:24.330> other<00:01:24.600> than<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
unique about this slide other than the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.890 
unique about this slide other than the
way<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.920> looks<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.880> let's<00:01:27.119> go<00:01:27.270> ahead<00:01:27.630> and

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
way it looks so let's go ahead and

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.810 
way it looks so let's go ahead and
convert<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> drag-and-drop<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.640> what

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
convert this to a drag-and-drop so what

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.780 
convert this to a drag-and-drop so what
we<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.210> here<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.810> we've<00:01:31.710> got<00:01:31.740> some<00:01:32.220> notes<00:01:32.430> and

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
we have here is we've got some notes and

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.240 
we have here is we've got some notes and
I'll<00:01:32.880> make<00:01:33.060> these<00:01:33.299> documents<00:01:34.170> they're<00:01:35.009> just

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
I'll make these documents they're just

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.160 
I'll make these documents they're just
generic<00:01:35.520> but<00:01:35.939> we'll<00:01:36.119> make<00:01:36.299> these<00:01:36.509> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
generic but we'll make these the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.069 
generic but we'll make these the
draggable<00:01:37.799> objects<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.610> then<00:01:39.150> we've<00:01:39.360> got<00:01:39.689> our

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
draggable objects and then we've got our

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.410 
draggable objects and then we've got our
drop<00:01:40.439> target<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.100> just<00:01:41.280> put<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.460> hotspot<00:01:41.970> here

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
drop target so I just put a hotspot here

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.080 
drop target so I just put a hotspot here
and<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.960> titled<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.470> drop<00:01:43.740> target<00:01:44.280> typically

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
and I titled it drop target typically

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.340 
and I titled it drop target typically
when<00:01:45.390> you're<00:01:45.509> building<00:01:45.750> elearning<00:01:46.320> courses

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
when you're building elearning courses

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.069 
when you're building elearning courses
or<00:01:46.979> drag-and-drop<00:01:47.369> interactions<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.930> need

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
or drag-and-drop interactions you need

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.899 
or drag-and-drop interactions you need
something<00:01:49.470> that's<00:01:49.619> draggable<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.549> then<00:01:50.729> it

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
something that's draggable and then it

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.359 
something that's draggable and then it
needs<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.630> place<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.899> go<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.740> that's<00:01:52.860> your<00:01:53.100> drop

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
needs a place to go and that's your drop

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.300 
needs a place to go and that's your drop
target<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.509> we<00:01:54.990> have<00:01:55.110> our<00:01:55.140> draggable<00:01:55.799> objects

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
target so we have our draggable objects

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.880 
target so we have our draggable objects
and<00:01:56.579> then<00:01:56.759> we<00:01:56.850> have<00:01:57.000> our<00:01:57.090> drop<00:01:57.329> target<00:01:57.840> what<00:01:58.770> we

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
and then we have our drop target what we

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.130 
and then we have our drop target what we
need<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.130> do<00:01:59.280> now<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.670> actually<00:02:00.000> create<00:02:00.990> the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
need to do now is actually create the

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.240 
need to do now is actually create the
drag-and-drop<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:01.890> I'm<00:02:01.950> going<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.130> go<00:02:02.189> to

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
drag-and-drop so I'm going to go to

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.609 
drag-and-drop so I'm going to go to
insert<00:02:02.670> we<00:02:03.570> have<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:03.869> convert<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.469> freeform

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
insert we have this convert to freeform

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.530 
insert we have this convert to freeform
option<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:05.610> I'm<00:02:05.670> going<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.850> click<00:02:06.060> that

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
option so I'm going to click that

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.559 
option so I'm going to click that
choose<00:02:07.200> drag-and-drop<00:02:07.740> hit<00:02:08.369> OK<00:02:08.759> now<00:02:09.390> what

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
choose drag-and-drop hit OK now what

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.869 
choose drag-and-drop hit OK now what
that<00:02:09.599> does<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.379> opens<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.860> form<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.670> what

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
that does is that opens a form so what

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.700 
that does is that opens a form so what
we<00:02:12.030> can<00:02:12.180> do<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.569> on<00:02:12.720> one<00:02:12.959> side<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.440> for

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
we can do is on one side of the for

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.020 
we can do is on one side of the for
we<00:02:13.890> choose<00:02:14.190> what<00:02:14.430> do<00:02:14.490> we<00:02:14.610> want<00:02:14.820> to<00:02:14.880> make

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
we choose what do we want to make

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.660 
we choose what do we want to make
Dragonball<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.930> what<00:02:16.680> we're<00:02:16.830> going<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.130> do<00:02:17.400> is

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
Dragonball and what we're going to do is

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.520 
Dragonball and what we're going to do is
we're<00:02:18.180> going<00:02:18.210> to<00:02:18.330> make<00:02:18.540> all<00:02:18.810> four<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.320> these

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
we're going to make all four of these

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.170 
we're going to make all four of these
documents<00:02:19.830> draggable<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:20.790> I'm<00:02:20.880> just<00:02:21.000> going<00:02:21.120> to

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
documents draggable so I'm just going to

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.200 
documents draggable so I'm just going to
go<00:02:21.330> ahead<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.810> select<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.680> notes<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:24.000> it

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
go ahead and select the notes and it

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.880 
go ahead and select the notes and it
doesn't<00:02:24.570> matter<00:02:24.720> if<00:02:24.870> they're<00:02:25.140> right<00:02:25.170> or<00:02:25.680> wrong

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
doesn't matter if they're right or wrong

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.420 
doesn't matter if they're right or wrong
choices<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:27.240> fact<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:27.690> they're<00:02:28.650> choices<00:02:29.280> we

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
choices the fact that they're choices we

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.030 
choices the fact that they're choices we
want<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.700> make<00:02:29.850> them<00:02:30.030> all<00:02:30.330> draggable<00:02:31.110> the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
want to make them all draggable the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.070 
want to make them all draggable the
right<00:02:32.250> or<00:02:32.430> wrong<00:02:32.580> is<00:02:32.880> will<00:02:33.270> determine<00:02:33.630> here<00:02:33.990> on

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
right or wrong is will determine here on

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.900 
right or wrong is will determine here on
the<00:02:34.170> drop<00:02:34.440> target<00:02:34.890> so<00:02:35.310> let's<00:02:35.490> just<00:02:35.700> make

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
the drop target so let's just make

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.140 
the drop target so let's just make
number<00:02:36.210> one<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.810> number<00:02:36.960> four<00:02:37.850> correct<00:02:38.850> so

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
number one and number four correct so

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.300 
number one and number four correct so
those<00:02:39.390> will<00:02:39.570> have<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:40.080> correct<00:02:40.320> drop<00:02:40.890> target

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
those will have the correct drop target

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.650 
those will have the correct drop target
here<00:02:41.580> so<00:02:41.730> we're<00:02:41.850> going<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.030> choose<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.390> drop

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
here so we're going to choose the drop

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.530 
here so we're going to choose the drop
target<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:43.380> title<00:02:44.310> this<00:02:44.550> drop<00:02:44.910> target<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:45.510> it's

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
target I title this drop target so it's

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.230 
target I title this drop target so it's
easy<00:02:45.810> for<00:02:45.960> me<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.260> see<00:02:46.670> so<00:02:47.670> I've<00:02:47.790> got<00:02:48.000> that

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
easy for me to see so I've got that

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.600 
easy for me to see so I've got that
these<00:02:48.570> two<00:02:48.930> don't<00:02:49.140> have<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.380> drop<00:02:49.680> drop<00:02:50.130> target

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
these two don't have a drop drop target

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.820 
these two don't have a drop drop target
now<00:02:51.180> if<00:02:51.330> we<00:02:51.480> think<00:02:51.510> about<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.050> they're<00:02:52.680> all

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
now if we think about it they're all

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.710 
now if we think about it they're all
going<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.010> be<00:02:53.100> draggable<00:02:53.790> but<00:02:54.090> only<00:02:54.360> two<00:02:54.570> of

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
going to be draggable but only two of

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.900 
going to be draggable but only two of
them<00:02:54.810> are<00:02:54.930> correct<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:55.800> these<00:02:55.980> two<00:02:56.340> that

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
them are correct and so these two that

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.970 
them are correct and so these two that
are<00:02:57.060> draggable<00:02:57.600> or<00:02:57.720> distractor<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:58.680> they<00:02:58.800> get

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
are draggable or distractor so they get

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.210 
are draggable or distractor so they get
you<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.570> possibly<00:03:00.570> make<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.870> mistake<00:03:01.020> or<00:03:01.890> I

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
you to possibly make a mistake or I

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.930 
you to possibly make a mistake or I
forces<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.210> to<00:03:03.240> pay<00:03:04.140> attention<00:03:04.170> and

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
forces you to pay attention and

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.660 
forces you to pay attention and
understand<00:03:05.940> exactly<00:03:06.320> the<00:03:07.320> correct<00:03:07.860> versus

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
understand exactly the correct versus

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.880 
understand exactly the correct versus
the<00:03:08.790> incorrect<00:03:09.240> and<00:03:10.170> then<00:03:10.410> we'll<00:03:10.590> go<00:03:10.740> ahead

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
the incorrect and then we'll go ahead

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.670 
the incorrect and then we'll go ahead
and<00:03:11.040> keep<00:03:11.310> everything<00:03:11.670> else<00:03:12.110> by<00:03:13.110> default<00:03:13.560> so

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
and keep everything else by default so

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.320 
and keep everything else by default so
I'm<00:03:13.740> going<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:13.920> hit<00:03:14.010> save<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.430> close<00:03:14.730> now<00:03:15.030> if

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
I'm going to hit save and close now if

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.380 
I'm going to hit save and close now if
we<00:03:15.480> preview<00:03:15.960> this<00:03:16.200> what<00:03:17.040> was<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.280> static<00:03:18.030> slide

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
we preview this what was a static slide

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.740 
we preview this what was a static slide
now<00:03:19.320> is<00:03:19.740> a<00:03:19.770> slide<00:03:20.610> with<00:03:20.850> drag<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:21.210> drop<00:03:21.540> so<00:03:21.690> I'm

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
now is a slide with drag and drop so I'm

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.570 
now is a slide with drag and drop so I'm
going<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:21.960> go<00:03:22.050> ahead<00:03:22.170> I'll<00:03:22.770> just<00:03:23.010> put<00:03:23.220> all<00:03:23.430> of

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
going to go ahead I'll just put all of

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.880 
going to go ahead I'll just put all of
them<00:03:23.730> on<00:03:23.880> here<00:03:24.240> you<00:03:24.870> can<00:03:24.900> see<00:03:25.230> I<00:03:25.260> hit<00:03:25.440> submit

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
them on here you can see I hit submit

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.830 
them on here you can see I hit submit
and<00:03:26.160> I<00:03:26.340> get<00:03:26.550> my<00:03:26.670> feedback<00:03:26.970> all<00:03:27.360> that's<00:03:27.540> built

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
and I get my feedback all that's built

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.400 
and I get my feedback all that's built
by<00:03:28.050> the<00:03:28.680> software<00:03:29.310> if<00:03:29.550> we<00:03:29.760> replay<00:03:30.360> it<00:03:30.570> let's<00:03:31.170> go

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
by the software if we replay it let's go

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.650 
by the software if we replay it let's go
ahead<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:32.220> we'll<00:03:32.610> put<00:03:32.820> the<00:03:32.910> correct<00:03:33.180> ones<00:03:33.480> in

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
ahead and we'll put the correct ones in

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.260 
ahead and we'll put the correct ones in
here<00:03:33.990> it's<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.860> mitt<00:03:35.070> and<00:03:35.100> then<00:03:35.460> we<00:03:35.610> got<00:03:35.910> correct

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
here it's a mitt and then we got correct

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.760 
here it's a mitt and then we got correct
feedback<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:36.960> then<00:03:37.050> I<00:03:37.080> could<00:03:37.320> change<00:03:37.530> the

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
feedback and then I could change the

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.140 
feedback and then I could change the
expression<00:03:38.040> of<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.430> character<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.000> and

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
expression of the character and and

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.630 
expression of the character and and
those<00:03:39.750> things<00:03:40.020> as<00:03:40.200> well<00:03:40.380> but<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:41.100> essence<00:03:41.490> of

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
those things as well but the essence of

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.150 
those things as well but the essence of
this<00:03:41.790> tutorial<00:03:42.360> is<00:03:42.420> to<00:03:42.450> show<00:03:42.630> you<00:03:42.840> that

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
this tutorial is to show you that

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.920 
this tutorial is to show you that
building<00:03:44.160> drag-and-drop<00:03:44.750> interactivity<00:03:45.750> is

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
building drag-and-drop interactivity is

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.620 
building drag-and-drop interactivity is
pretty<00:03:46.530> simple<00:03:46.860> today<00:03:47.370> so<00:03:47.880> now<00:03:48.090> it's<00:03:48.330> just<00:03:48.420> a

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
pretty simple today so now it's just a

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.200 
pretty simple today so now it's just a
matter<00:03:48.780> of<00:03:48.930> when<00:03:49.230> is<00:03:49.920> it<00:03:50.160> appropriate<00:03:50.490> to<00:03:50.820> your

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
matter of when is it appropriate to your

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.260 
matter of when is it appropriate to your
learning<00:03:51.660> experience
