00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.749 
a second there we go so you have that
and<00:02:06.009> then<00:02:07.009> take<00:02:07.700> this<00:02:08.539> corner<00:02:09.220> here<00:02:10.220> do<00:02:10.670> you

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
and then take this corner here do you

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.270 
and then take this corner here do you
see<00:02:10.910> what<00:02:11.000> I<00:02:11.030> mean<00:02:11.060> so<00:02:11.959> there's<00:02:12.770> your<00:02:12.860> middle

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280

see what I mean so there's your middle
and<00:02:14.530> take<00:02:15.530> this<00:02:15.800> fear<00:02:16.760> and<00:02:17.000> her<00:02:17.870> with<00:02:18.410> this<00:02:18.620> is

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
and take this fear and her with this is

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.410 
and take this fear and her with this is
really<00:02:18.980> hard<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.340> figure<00:02:19.580> out<00:02:19.880> because<00:02:20.060> I

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
really hard to figure out because I

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.110 
really hard to figure out because I
don't<00:02:21.020> know<00:02:21.110> what's<00:02:21.370> that's<00:02:22.370> okay<00:02:22.730> so<00:02:22.790> here's

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
don't know what's that's okay so here's

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.080 
don't know what's that's okay so here's
your<00:02:23.270> top

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
your top

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.360 
your top
that's<00:02:24.269> my<00:02:24.420> bottom<00:02:24.720> oh<00:02:25.050> that's<00:02:25.950> probably<00:02:26.099> good

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
that's my bottom oh that's probably good

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.420 
that's my bottom oh that's probably good
okay<00:02:26.940> so<00:02:27.300> take<00:02:27.510> this<00:02:27.690> corner<00:02:28.019> and<00:02:28.310> flip<00:02:29.310> it

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
okay so take this corner and flip it

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.059 
okay so take this corner and flip it
into<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:30.000> middle<00:02:30.569> and<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:31.410> you'll<00:02:31.590> get<00:02:31.769> that

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
into the middle and so you'll get that

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:38.000 
into the middle and so you'll get that
hang<00:02:32.640> on<00:02:33.470> so<00:02:34.470> you'll<00:02:34.650> get<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:36.800> do<00:02:37.800> you<00:02:37.860> see

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
hang on so you'll get that do you see

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.369
