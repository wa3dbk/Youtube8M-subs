00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:00.320 
by giving outside the steering is for

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:00.900 
by giving outside the steering is for
you

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:00.910 
you

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:07.040

so<00:07:16.250> hydraulics<00:07:17.000> work<00:07:17.270> PPO<00:07:17.780> works<00:07:18.139> I<00:07:18.639> mean

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:19.639 
so hydraulics work PPO works I mean

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:25.740 
so hydraulics work PPO works I mean
everything<00:07:20.180> is<00:07:20.389> just
