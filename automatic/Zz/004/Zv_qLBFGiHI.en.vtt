over the last couple weeks I've done an

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.100 
over the last couple weeks I've done an
experiment<00:00:03.540> with<00:00:04.970> 85<00:00:05.970> vs<00:00:06.540> 87<00:00:07.319> in<00:00:07.529> my<00:00:07.940> 2007

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110

engine that has a flex fuel capability
and<00:00:15.929> it<00:00:16.139> also<00:00:16.289> has<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.920> ability<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:18.210> shut<00:00:18.539> off

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
and it also has the ability to shut off

four cylinders or switches timing up I

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.540 
four cylinders or switches timing up I
don't<00:00:22.170> know<00:00:22.230> how<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.410> how<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:22.949> works<00:00:23.250> but

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
don't know how the how it works but

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.060 
don't know how the how it works but
anyways<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:24.060> can<00:00:24.210> go<00:00:24.750> from<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:25.170> eight<00:00:25.590> cylinder

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
anyways it can go from a eight cylinder

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.310 
anyways it can go from a eight cylinder
to<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.279> four<00:00:26.580> cylinder<00:00:26.910> or<00:00:27.240> from<00:00:27.930> four<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.199> eight

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
to a four cylinder or from four to eight

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.310 
to a four cylinder or from four to eight
depending<00:00:28.980> on<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:30.630> terrain<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.050> it's

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
depending on on the terrain that it's

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.260 
depending on on the terrain that it's
going<00:00:31.560> over<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:31.980> from<00:00:32.189> going<00:00:32.460> flat<00:00:32.730> highway

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
going over so from going flat highway

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.060 
going over so from going flat highway
that<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.750> switches<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.230> four<00:00:34.469> cylinders<00:00:34.920> to

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
that it switches to four cylinders to

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.420 
that it switches to four cylinders to
try<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.280> save<00:00:36.149> some<00:00:36.180> some<00:00:37.170> fuel<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:38.190> that's<00:00:38.370> the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
try to save some some fuel so that's the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.819

basically<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.770> cheaper<00:00:50.660> in<00:00:51.660> my<00:00:51.989> vehicle

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
basically it is cheaper in my vehicle

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.430 
basically it is cheaper in my vehicle
based<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.059> prices<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.690> purchased<00:00:55.230> is

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
based on the prices that I purchased is

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.569 
based on the prices that I purchased is
cheaper<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.399> buy<00:00:56.610> unleaded<00:00:57.270> gas<00:00:58.430> instead<00:00:59.430> of

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
cheaper to buy unleaded gas instead of

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.479 
cheaper to buy unleaded gas instead of
buying<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.600> e85<00:01:01.289> gas<00:01:01.590> even<00:01:01.949> though<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.250> price

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
buying a e85 gas even though the price

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.509 
buying a e85 gas even though the price
was<00:01:02.699> 49<00:01:03.210> cents<00:01:03.480> cheaper<00:01:03.690> per<00:01:04.019> gallon<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.519> saved

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
was 49 cents cheaper per gallon I saved

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.560 
was 49 cents cheaper per gallon I saved
I<00:01:07.100> made<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.280> up<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.850> efficiency<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
I made that up in the efficiency in the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.660 
I made that up in the efficiency in the
fuel<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.770> was<00:01:10.920> twenty<00:01:11.280> eight<00:01:11.310> point

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
fuel so the it was twenty eight point

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.960 
fuel so the it was twenty eight point
four<00:01:11.909> percent<00:01:12.150> more<00:01:13.040> efficient<00:01:14.040> energy

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
four percent more efficient energy

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.330 
four percent more efficient energy
efficient<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:16.409> drive<00:01:16.850> the<00:01:17.960> vehicle<00:01:18.960> with<00:01:19.409> 87

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
efficient to drive the vehicle with 87

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.020 
efficient to drive the vehicle with 87
gas<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.090> versus<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> e85<00:01:22.200> flex-fuel<00:01:23.030> okay

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
gas in it versus the e85 flex-fuel okay

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.140 
gas in it versus the e85 flex-fuel okay
so<00:01:24.710> if<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.860> decided<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.340> stop<00:01:26.580> watching<00:01:26.790> there

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
so if you decided to stop watching there

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.060 
so if you decided to stop watching there
that's<00:01:27.360> fine<00:01:27.630> for<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.259> people<00:01:28.530> who<00:01:28.619> stuff

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
that's fine for the people who stuff

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.890 
that's fine for the people who stuff
around<00:01:29.310> I'm<00:01:30.180> going<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.420> run<00:01:30.570> through<00:01:30.780> the

eight six seven nine gallons per mile so

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.280 
eight six seven nine gallons per mile so
I<00:01:55.649> used<00:01:56.009> point<00:01:56.430> zero<00:01:57.030> eight<00:01:57.329> six<00:01:57.630> seven<00:01:58.110> nine

I used point zero eight six seven nine

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.889 
I used point zero eight six seven nine
gallons<00:01:58.829> per<00:01:59.009> mile<00:01:59.189> which<00:01:59.430> cost<00:02:00.299> me<00:02:00.540> twenty

four point nine cents per mile that

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.440 
four point nine cents per mile that
equates<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.009> eleven<00:02:05.460> point<00:02:05.700> five<00:02:05.880> miles<00:02:06.299> per

it is 30 percent I would say rule of

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.990 
it is 30 percent I would say rule of
thumb<00:03:55.049> it's<00:03:55.530> twenty<00:03:55.799> point<00:03:56.040> four<00:03:56.190> but<00:03:56.430> if<00:03:56.819> it's

thumb it's twenty point four but if it's
thirty<00:03:57.329> percent<00:03:57.870> less<00:03:58.609> expensive<00:03:59.609> to

going to save enough money to make the

inefficiency worth worth your money so

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.319 
inefficiency worth worth your money so
just<00:04:12.480> take<00:04:12.720> a<00:04:12.750> round<00:04:13.260> number<00:04:13.700> so<00:04:14.700> four<00:04:15.060> dollars

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
just take a round number so four dollars

if<00:04:45.300> if<00:04:45.930> it's<00:04:46.169> anywhere<00:04:46.620> more<00:04:46.949> expensive<00:04:47.370> than

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
if if it's anywhere more expensive than

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.059 
if if it's anywhere more expensive than
that<00:04:47.639> so<00:04:48.300> sometimes<00:04:49.080> I'll<00:04:49.349> be<00:04:49.560> driving<00:04:49.919> down

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:50.069 
that so sometimes I'll be driving down

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:54.619 
that so sometimes I'll be driving down
the<00:04:50.220> road<00:04:51.000> and<00:04:51.270> I'll<00:04:51.599> see<00:04:51.780> that<00:04:52.430> 87<00:04:53.430> is<00:04:53.669> three

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:54.629 
the road and I'll see that 87 is three

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:57.350 
the road and I'll see that 87 is three
dollars<00:04:54.960> and<00:04:55.139> 86<00:04:55.740> cents<00:04:55.979> per<00:04:56.280> gallon<00:04:56.430> and<00:04:56.849> e85

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
dollars and 86 cents per gallon and e85

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.059 
dollars and 86 cents per gallon and e85
is<00:04:57.599> three<00:04:57.810> dollars<00:04:57.900> and<00:04:58.199> 26<00:04:58.590> cents<00:04:58.800> per<00:04:58.949> gallon

00:04:59.059 --> 00:04:59.069 
is three dollars and 26 cents per gallon

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:01.520 
is three dollars and 26 cents per gallon
and<00:04:59.639> you<00:04:59.759> think<00:04:59.940> a<00:05:00.000> new<00:05:00.150> 60<00:05:00.630> cents<00:05:00.960> that's

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
and you think a new 60 cents that's

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.689 
and you think a new 60 cents that's
cheap<00:05:02.039> well<00:05:02.729> in<00:05:03.240> reality<00:05:04.130> because<00:05:05.130> the

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
cheap well in reality because the

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:07.939 
cheap well in reality because the
difference<00:05:06.150> is<00:05:06.360> not<00:05:06.599> great<00:05:07.020> enough<00:05:07.169> it's

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
difference is not great enough it's

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.529 
difference is not great enough it's
actually<00:05:08.310> going<00:05:08.400> to<00:05:08.490> cost<00:05:08.669> you<00:05:08.909> more<00:05:09.090> to

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
actually going to cost you more to

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:12.770 
actually going to cost you more to
purchase<00:05:09.930> a<00:05:10.080> e85<00:05:10.440> or<00:05:10.500> run<00:05:10.800> it<00:05:10.919> because<00:05:11.039> of<00:05:11.780> the

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
purchase a e85 or run it because of the

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.540 
purchase a e85 or run it because of the
inefficiency<00:05:13.259> of<00:05:13.560> running<00:05:14.220> it<00:05:14.340> in<00:05:14.430> your

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
inefficiency of running it in your

inefficiency of running it in your
vehicle<00:05:14.970> now<00:05:15.360> if<00:05:15.539> your<00:05:15.659> vehicle<00:05:16.050> runs<00:05:16.229> that

vehicle now if your vehicle runs that

vehicle now if your vehicle runs that
weren't<00:05:17.400> runs<00:05:17.580> more<00:05:17.819> efficient<00:05:18.150> with<00:05:18.240> the<00:05:18.330> 85

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:18.659 
weren't runs more efficient with the 85

weren't runs more efficient with the 85
