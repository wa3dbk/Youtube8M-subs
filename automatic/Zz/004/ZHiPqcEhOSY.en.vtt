00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.819
 Hello and welcome to a first video and here it is 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:05.610
 directly 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.450
 to the 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.989
 Magic Mouse from Apple 

00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:12.669
 yes there are already a few - but now there is my video here 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:16.290
 first to the functions 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:22.270
 So everything here wants to be displayed is that it should work 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:25.989
 Of course I can count one I count 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.739
 I can scroll 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.100
 I can also zoom in the screen 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.100
 and I can too 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.100
 around Novi the Irish with two fingers 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.540
 Yes 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.739
 then around 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.000
 and come to the battery power 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.090
 TI is really incredible so I have it now 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.020
 Pages my putt says years closed thats now 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.300
 8 days 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.890
 yes, in those night days the whole 7 percent off and 9 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.380
 and I have always worked out this Michel 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.250
 and yes that's incredible so you can compare 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.710
 played with the Apple keyboard for the iMac to zero 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.470
 yes, the whole thing is via Bluetooth 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.260
 and where you have to send a mail send home 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.180
 you have to go here first 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.610
 as a software update just click on it 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.050
 and then he looks for the latest software 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.210
 and then you can find it here 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.690
 under the system settings and also have his Magic Mouse 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.980
 All in all, the Magic Mouse is just great for me 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.690
 you do not have this anymore 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.530
 boring 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.810
 and the revenue from then on 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.540
 Man really can 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.130
 Hertha late like the iPod has Schoder iPhone 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.450
 Just serve everything and Hartmann can do it 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.630
 with the iPhone or even mosquito trackpad from the MacBook pro 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.020
 to compare 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.860
 yes, and if you have more information here 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.960
 to have Magic Mouse just wants to get Ertel points de / medien 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.799
 a lot of information among critics 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:20.029
 yes another feature of the Magic Mouse 

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:23.900
 is around that is 360 Â° scrolling 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.989
 so used for the normal says 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.269
 why if I have something to do here or anything else 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.259
 in Cannes to sides but want to the right one must 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:37.509
 Of course, this is also possible here 

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:40.419
 easy with two fingers 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:44.769
 to the right and you can also book and down at the same time 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.489
 This is called as 60 degrees scrolling what you do with normal mice 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.569
 not necessarily can 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:53.680
 yes good 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.700
 Bottom line so this strange thing is just perfect 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:03.009
 and Apple has the market and so you get a new one I'm not rich 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:04.089
 made 

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:06.749
 and yes I am glad that I am the owner 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:10.329
 The Magic Mouse is available from 9 60 Euro 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.559
 it's a multitabs feast 

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:19.019
 and now many will say again in Q2 enjoyed times of wars 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.689
 I also try so much 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:22.690
 it is clear though 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.679
 the second match against us 

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:27.829
 This really is more money 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.829
 and yes, I'm really glad she owns 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.089
 I can only recommend it 

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:37.879
 and before I even nonsense Lorber now 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.449
 since I just go 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:41.429
 click on this data 

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:45.189
 Go to the new Apple Store and buy it wherever 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:46.549
 It is worth it 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.029
 and you do not get in shape 

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:51.059
 we have to live 

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:54.609
 So Martin Kaymer was put up the same way and then became one 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.609
 and you have that with your ears today 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:03:59.849
 so 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.239
 it is the next time tomorrow again in the evening
