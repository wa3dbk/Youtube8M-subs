and<00:02:50.540> for<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.049> bottom<00:02:51.380> it<00:02:51.530> was<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:51.650> 10<00:02:52.010> inch

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
and for the bottom it was a 10 inch

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.099 
and for the bottom it was a 10 inch
square<00:02:52.549> you<00:02:53.000> just<00:02:53.209> need<00:02:53.329> the<00:02:53.359> top<00:02:53.480> to<00:02:53.840> be<00:02:53.930> that

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109 
square you just need the top to be that

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:56.620 
square you just need the top to be that
little<00:02:54.290> bit<00:02:54.560> bigger<00:02:54.799> so<00:02:55.099> it<00:02:55.790> fits<00:02:56.060> nicely<00:02:56.329> over

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
little bit bigger so it fits nicely over

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.589 
little bit bigger so it fits nicely over
top<00:02:56.930> without<00:02:57.109> folding<00:02:57.560> it<00:02:57.859> in<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.329> then<00:02:59.329> this

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
top without folding it in and then this

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.400 
top without folding it in and then this
box<00:03:00.049> finished<00:03:00.739> is<00:03:01.810> about<00:03:02.810> three<00:03:03.169> and<00:03:03.200> a<00:03:03.380> half

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
box finished is about three and a half

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.370 
box finished is about three and a half
inches<00:03:03.829> square<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:04.910> give<00:03:05.060> you<00:03:05.180> this<00:03:05.329> size<00:03:05.900> and

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
inches square to give you this size and

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.330 
inches square to give you this size and
it<00:03:07.370> is<00:03:08.090> one<00:03:08.480> and<00:03:08.630> three-quarter<00:03:09.230> inches<00:03:09.440> in

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
it is one and three-quarter inches in

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.879 
it is one and three-quarter inches in
height<00:03:10.400> but<00:03:11.209> then<00:03:11.419> depending<00:03:12.290> on<00:03:12.410> how<00:03:12.560> you<00:03:12.620> put

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:12.889 
height but then depending on how you put

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:16.629 
height but then depending on how you put
the<00:03:13.010> top<00:03:13.250> on<00:03:13.489> you<00:03:13.819> can<00:03:14.000> make<00:03:14.180> it<00:03:14.209> bigger<00:03:15.310> so<00:03:16.310> I'm

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
the top on you can make it bigger so I'm

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.750 
the top on you can make it bigger so I'm
going<00:03:17.000> to<00:03:17.060> show<00:03:17.239> you<00:03:17.299> how<00:03:17.419> to<00:03:18.109> fold<00:03:18.260> your<00:03:18.440> paper

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
going to show you how to fold your paper

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.259 
going to show you how to fold your paper
please<00:03:19.760> start<00:03:20.150> by<00:03:21.040> folding<00:03:22.040> it<00:03:22.400> in<00:03:22.700> half<00:03:22.730> on

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
please start by folding it in half on

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.120 
please start by folding it in half on
the<00:03:23.419> diagonal<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:24.169> I<00:03:24.260> like<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.620> use<00:03:24.769> a<00:03:24.799> bone

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
the diagonal and I like to use a bone

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.850 
the diagonal and I like to use a bone
folder

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.150 

it<00:03:28.460> just<00:03:28.730> is<00:03:29.540> easier<00:03:30.050> to<00:03:30.290> make<00:03:30.470> those<00:03:30.680> crisp

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
it just is easier to make those crisp

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.150 
it just is easier to make those crisp
folds<00:03:31.880> and<00:03:32.030> then<00:03:32.720> you<00:03:32.870> turn<00:03:33.140> it<00:03:33.170> around<00:03:33.470> and<00:03:33.860> do

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
folds and then you turn it around and do

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:44.730 
folds and then you turn it around and do
it<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.430> opposite<00:03:34.940> way<00:03:42.460> so<00:03:43.460> now<00:03:43.640> you<00:03:43.730> have<00:03:44.120> your

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
it the opposite way so now you have your

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.670 
it the opposite way so now you have your
fold<00:03:45.740> so<00:03:46.100> now<00:03:46.280> we<00:03:46.340> are<00:03:46.550> holding<00:03:47.170> the<00:03:48.170> corners

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
fold so now we are holding the corners

00:03:48.680 --> 00:04:02.410 
fold so now we are holding the corners
into<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.370> middle<00:04:00.730> so<00:04:01.730> you<00:04:01.760> can<00:04:02.000> see<00:04:02.209> that

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
into the middle so you can see that

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.530 
into the middle so you can see that
being<00:04:02.810> this<00:04:03.080> paper<00:04:03.380> is<00:04:03.590> a<00:04:03.620> little<00:04:04.040> thinner

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
being this paper is a little thinner

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.690 
being this paper is a little thinner
it's<00:04:05.540> really<00:04:05.840> easy<00:04:06.170> to<00:04:06.320> fold<00:04:06.739> some<00:04:07.520> of<00:04:07.580> the

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
it's really easy to fold some of the

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.570 
it's really easy to fold some of the
thicker<00:04:08.060> papers<00:04:08.810> out<00:04:08.989> there<00:04:09.260> you<00:04:09.860> may<00:04:10.160> get

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
thicker papers out there you may get

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.280 
thicker papers out there you may get
that<00:04:12.459> the<00:04:13.459> white<00:04:13.730> so<00:04:14.150> it<00:04:14.180> almost<00:04:14.690> breaks<00:04:15.110> the

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
that the white so it almost breaks the

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.780 
that the white so it almost breaks the
paper<00:04:15.530> if<00:04:15.709> you<00:04:15.830> did<00:04:15.980> not<00:04:16.160> actually<00:04:16.310> put<00:04:16.669> the

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
paper if you did not actually put the

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.729 
paper if you did not actually put the
score<00:04:17.030> line<00:04:17.209> first<00:04:17.570> and<00:04:17.750> you<00:04:18.320> won't<00:04:18.500> get<00:04:18.620> us

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
score line first and you won't get us

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.520 
score line first and you won't get us
nice<00:04:19.010> as<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:19.370> fold<00:04:19.609> so<00:04:20.419> now<00:04:20.570> that<00:04:20.840> all<00:04:21.079> our

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
nice as the fold so now that all our

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.260 
nice as the fold so now that all our
four<00:04:22.100> corners<00:04:22.400> are<00:04:22.550> folded<00:04:22.850> in<00:04:22.970> we're<00:04:23.120> going

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
four corners are folded in we're going

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.920 
four corners are folded in we're going
to<00:04:23.419> turn<00:04:23.600> it<00:04:23.750> over<00:04:23.900> and<00:04:25.000> fold<00:04:26.000> it<00:04:26.240> once<00:04:26.570> again

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
to turn it over and fold it once again

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:49.260 
to turn it over and fold it once again
on<00:04:27.169> the<00:04:27.380> diagonal<00:04:34.660> and<00:04:36.460> then<00:04:37.460> be<00:04:38.120> opposite<00:04:38.630> way

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.440 

and<00:04:50.270> then<00:04:50.720> we're<00:04:50.870> going<00:04:50.990> to<00:04:51.110> go<00:04:51.350> back<00:04:51.380> to<00:04:52.450> here

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
and then we're going to go back to here

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.320 
and then we're going to go back to here
now<00:04:54.050> we're<00:04:54.290> going<00:04:54.410> to<00:04:54.560> fold<00:04:54.860> each<00:04:55.310> edge<00:04:55.610> up<00:04:55.970> to

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
now we're going to fold each edge up to

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:02.260 
now we're going to fold each edge up to
the<00:04:56.480> middle<00:04:56.690> like<00:04:57.470> this<00:05:00.880> this<00:05:01.880> is<00:05:01.940> when<00:05:02.180> the

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
the middle like this this is when the

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.000 
the middle like this this is when the
bone<00:05:02.480> folder<00:05:02.750> is<00:05:02.990> good<00:05:03.230> cuz<00:05:03.440> you're<00:05:03.620> going

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
bone folder is good cuz you're going

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.250 
bone folder is good cuz you're going
through<00:05:04.340> few<00:05:05.000> more<00:05:05.210> thicknesses<00:05:05.870> of<00:05:05.930> paper

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
through few more thicknesses of paper

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.170 
through few more thicknesses of paper
you're<00:05:07.130> going<00:05:07.310> to<00:05:07.370> do<00:05:07.520> that<00:05:07.700> all<00:05:07.940> the<00:05:07.970> way

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
you're going to do that all the way

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:16.150 
you're going to do that all the way
around<00:05:13.810> you<00:05:14.810> fold<00:05:15.080> it<00:05:15.230> and<00:05:15.290> then<00:05:15.530> unfold<00:05:15.980> it

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
around you fold it and then unfold it

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:30.700 
around you fold it and then unfold it
into<00:05:16.820> the<00:05:16.970> next<00:05:17.300> side<00:05:28.120> and<00:05:29.230> then<00:05:30.230> you're<00:05:30.530> done

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
into the next side and then you're done

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.060 
into the next side and then you're done
so<00:05:31.190> you<00:05:31.250> unfold<00:05:31.880> it<00:05:32.410> you<00:05:33.410> leave<00:05:33.620> that<00:05:33.650> in<00:05:33.980> the

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
so you unfold it you leave that in the

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.360 
so you unfold it you leave that in the
middle<00:05:35.320> so<00:05:36.320> now<00:05:36.470> what<00:05:36.680> you're<00:05:36.800> doing<00:05:36.860> is

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
middle so now what you're doing is

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.140 
middle so now what you're doing is
you're<00:05:38.230> bringing<00:05:39.230> up<00:05:39.350> your<00:05:39.380> aside<00:05:39.950> and<00:05:40.430> then

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
you're bringing up your aside and then

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.480 
you're bringing up your aside and then
this<00:05:41.420> is<00:05:41.690> just<00:05:41.720> automatically<00:05:42.680> folding<00:05:43.340> over

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
this is just automatically folding over

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:55.360 
this is just automatically folding over
and<00:05:44.470> it's<00:05:45.470> going<00:05:45.710> to<00:05:45.830> pull<00:05:46.330> down<00:05:54.160> and<00:05:55.160> what<00:05:55.340> I

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
and it's going to pull down and what I

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.150 
and it's going to pull down and what I
like<00:05:55.610> to<00:05:55.760> do<00:05:55.940> is<00:05:56.210> put<00:05:57.110> a<00:05:57.140> little<00:05:57.410> bit<00:05:57.650> of<00:05:57.710> white

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 
like to do is put a little bit of white

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.770 
like to do is put a little bit of white
glue<00:05:58.370> I<00:05:58.790> use<00:05:59.630> the<00:05:59.780> quick<00:05:59.990> dry<00:06:01.090> you<00:06:02.090> don't<00:06:02.270> have

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
glue I use the quick dry you don't have
