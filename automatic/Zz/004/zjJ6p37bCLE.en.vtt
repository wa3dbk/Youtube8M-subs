 Hello, how are you? 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:11.580
 showed this video to show you this 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.160
 a type of memory card for 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.619
 us that we occupy a lot of space in 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.550
 the phones unfortunately I have 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.710
 is my 16 gigabyte phone and right now 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.349
 for months that is not much much 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.259
 ability then I'm going to show you this 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.450
 option for those who have to 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.950
 download much content from the internet 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.960
 lots of data and they already have your 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.809
 phones so much your memories in fact I 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.530
 I have a memory in an external memory 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:44.719
 as you can see 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:46.519
 16 gb is not enough here 16 and 16 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.899
 of the phone that are practically 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.520
 comfortable where they leave you with all 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.560
 the applications that the phone has 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.630
 that the operating system has to 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:59.360
 install then you are a good option 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:05.710
 for you 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:09.950
 for those who want to have more this 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:13.840
 more stores inc 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.840
 let me show what I have here 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.710
 I 'm sorry about all this now I know it's 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:27.750
 the phone has 2 GB that I have to 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.740
 say three days but in total 12 those that 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.250
 they leave you we would make all the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:36.180
 applications and also what you have 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.700
 in the visit I have 14 that is 16 that 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.410
 format and everything is left 14 then 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.410
 I have, as we will see, I have a guide 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:50.030
 so 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.030
 it is a good option of this memory 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.880
 for those who as I tell them how I 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.509
 I think they like to go down a lot 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:02.170
 internet data 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:04.240
 64 gb and it is class 10 as you will see very 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.460
 fast when you want to transfer data 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.259
 for your computer or for what you 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.520
 you want is a very good option 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:15.890
 here is up to 30 brings 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.660
 of 30 megabytes per second here says 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.450
 this is a good option for those 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.310
 who want this 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.660
 have more data as I say more up 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.900
 now they are more storage you 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.900
 phone 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.330
 let's see how 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.330
 how is it 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.550
 okay 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.550
 that this thing would not be left 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.330
 I bring a note in my hand, nothing to 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.330
 break 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:57.880
 the workshop or I think 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:00.780
 finally they will be something ira 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.780
 it's a good option 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.290
 ah 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.130
 fine consolations everything I say to you 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.130
 Talk now 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.890
 what is the adapter 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.650
 and here is the memory 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.610
 okay 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.430
 and this when you want to transfer data it 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.780
 will compute for the bad put as you will see 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.920
 they just put it in and they put the 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:38.360
 computer adapter 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.480
 let's see if the detected wish the 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.069
 phones are compatible for 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.170
 memories of 64 gigabytes and we're going to 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.620
 get lucky phone now see if the 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.620
 detects 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.430
 number 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.900
 so let's see 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.650
 I think you have to format it first 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:06.500
 here you will see if you want I accept it 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:08.680
 the total space 59 points school 5 and 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.680
 vice 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.940
 as I say this is a good option for 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:19.109
 those who want to have this more capacity 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:23.189
 on their phones 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:27.530
 here is 64 gigabytes compatible 

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:27.530
 It is compatible with the Samsung Galaxy S3 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.400
 and those who liked this forgotten fort 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.320
 for 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.820
 the signs and I wanted to show you these 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.860
 for people who want as I say 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.840
 that have more storage in their 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.370
 phones this is a good option 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.820
 ok I hope you liked this short the 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:48.449
 video and as I say it is class 10 of 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.389
 fast there's class 6 it's a bit slower 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:53.729
 the data transfer there is class 4 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.650
 also but that I already have previous and 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.389
 is one of the fastest in the class 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.740
 10 it seems for people to notice 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:03.260
 when you want to buy a memory 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.270
 some days 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.290
 so that they will teher the fastest data 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.280
 in the computer computer 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:13.169
 well it has been a small detail 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.849
 I wanted to show them and 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.219
 and I hope so, like now, too 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:19.449
 they can do the same thing acquire this 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:24.669
 card 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:27.129
 and so have the phone a short video and 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:28.930
 but I hope you liked it and you know 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:33.240
 here we are and anything you ask 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.240
 that we are up to the next goodbye
