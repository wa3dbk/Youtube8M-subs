00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.899 

so<00:00:00.780> how<00:00:01.020> dangerous<00:00:01.530> and<00:00:01.770> lives<00:00:01.979> we<00:00:02.669> thought

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
so how dangerous and lives we thought

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.599 
so how dangerous and lives we thought
we'd<00:00:03.090> do<00:00:03.240> a<00:00:03.270> little<00:00:03.330> test<00:00:03.780> and<00:00:04.400> show<00:00:05.400> you<00:00:05.460> just

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
we'd do a little test and show you just

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.310 
we'd do a little test and show you just
how<00:00:05.879> dangerous<00:00:06.089> they<00:00:06.450> can<00:00:06.480> be<00:00:08.929> so<00:00:09.929> these<00:00:10.110> are

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
how dangerous they can be so these are

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.730 
how dangerous they can be so these are
the<00:00:10.410> knives<00:00:10.650> that<00:00:10.920> we're<00:00:11.070> going<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.429> be<00:00:11.519> using

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
the knives that we're going to be using

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.519 
the knives that we're going to be using
this<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.460> craft<00:00:14.969> knife<00:00:15.210> or<00:00:15.480> box<00:00:15.630> cutter<00:00:16.020> very

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
this is a craft knife or box cutter very

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.580 
this is a craft knife or box cutter very
common<00:00:16.890> very<00:00:16.920> cheap<00:00:17.369> easy<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.789> get<00:00:17.910> hold<00:00:18.090> of

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
common very cheap easy to get hold of

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.650 
common very cheap easy to get hold of
this<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.010> vegetable<00:00:20.520> knife<00:00:20.910> not<00:00:21.600> a

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
this is a vegetable knife not a

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.380 
this is a vegetable knife not a
particularly<00:00:21.990> sharp<00:00:22.320> one<00:00:23.119> but<00:00:24.119> we'll<00:00:24.269> see

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
particularly sharp one but we'll see

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.130 
particularly sharp one but we'll see
what<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.630> does

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
what that does

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.529 
what that does
this<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.039> larger<00:00:26.519> kitchen<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:27.029> think<00:00:27.060> in<00:00:27.359> not

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
this is a larger kitchen I think in not

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.370 
this is a larger kitchen I think in not
a<00:00:27.570> particularly<00:00:27.960> sharp<00:00:28.170> one<00:00:28.789> and<00:00:30.080> finally<00:00:31.080> we

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
a particularly sharp one and finally we

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.920 
a particularly sharp one and finally we
have<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.830> small<00:00:32.550> folding<00:00:33.300> knife<00:00:35.630> so<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:36.780> is

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
have a small folding knife so this is

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.619 
have a small folding knife so this is
what<00:00:37.110> we're<00:00:37.290> going<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.620> be<00:00:37.800> using<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.579> show<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
what we're going to be using to show the

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.610 
what we're going to be using to show the
effects<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.860> slashes<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:42.079> it's<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.440> leg

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
effects of the slashes on it's the leg

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.180 
effects of the slashes on it's the leg
of<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.890> pig<00:00:45.170> this<00:00:46.170> we<00:00:46.440> can<00:00:46.620> do<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.980> demonstrate

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
of a pig this we can do to demonstrate

00:00:47.190 --> 00:01:02.570 
of a pig this we can do to demonstrate
the<00:00:47.789> kind<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.149> damage<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.750> can<00:00:48.930> expect

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.050 

it's<00:01:03.580> gone<00:01:03.820> a<00:01:03.850> good<00:01:05.760> centimeter<00:01:06.760> maybe

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.230 
centimeter and a half next one

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:23.990 
centimeter and a half next one
not<00:01:14.800> particularly<00:01:15.130> sharp<00:01:15.430> vegetable<00:01:15.910> life

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
okay so that one's only gone about five

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.540 
okay so that one's only gone about five
mils<00:01:30.050> not<00:01:31.050> too<00:01:31.230> bad<00:01:31.380> actually<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.920> one<00:01:34.550> okay

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550

okay this one the bone is straight

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.990 
okay this one the bone is straight
underneath<00:01:49.140> there<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.830> probably<00:01:50.580> can't<00:01:50.790> see

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
underneath there you probably can't see

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.730 
underneath there you probably can't see
this<00:01:51.180> -<00:01:51.390> well<00:01:51.540> it's<00:01:51.780> gone<00:01:51.960> in<00:01:52.170> about<00:01:52.290> three

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.460 
this - well it's gone in about three
centimeters<00:01:53.810> including<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.900> good<00:01:55.080> couple<00:01:55.410> of

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
centimeters including a good couple of

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.950 
centimeters including a good couple of
centimeters<00:01:55.979> into<00:01:56.190> the<00:01:56.280> bone<00:02:00.860> okay<00:02:01.860> last<00:02:02.460> one

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
centimeters into the bone okay last one

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:15.830 
centimeters into the bone okay last one
small<00:02:03.960> hole<00:02:04.259> in<00:02:04.440> mine

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.589 

oh<00:02:15.870> that's<00:02:16.560> what's<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.430> good<00:02:17.670> seven

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
oh that's what's that good seven

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.729 
oh that's what's that good seven
centimeters<00:02:19.200> maybe<00:02:19.670> right<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:21.440> right<00:02:22.440> through

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
centimeters maybe right in right through

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.729 
centimeters maybe right in right through
there<00:02:22.890> couple<00:02:23.220> of<00:02:23.400> layers<00:02:23.520> muscle<00:02:24.530> nice<00:02:25.530> and

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
there couple of layers muscle nice and

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:33.380 
there couple of layers muscle nice and
big<00:02:30.500> so<00:02:31.500> any<00:02:31.800> one<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.069> these<00:02:32.310> cats<00:02:32.610> may<00:02:32.910> not<00:02:33.150> be

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
big so any one of these cats may not be

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.250 
big so any one of these cats may not be
fatal<00:02:33.750> but<00:02:35.239> remember<00:02:36.239> you<00:02:36.690> know<00:02:36.870> that

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
fatal but remember you know that

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.870 
fatal but remember you know that
probably<00:02:37.500> selecting<00:02:38.130> more<00:02:38.280> than<00:02:38.459> once<00:02:38.700> so

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
probably selecting more than once so

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.089 
probably selecting more than once so
they're<00:02:39.239> going<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.480> add<00:02:39.630> up<00:02:39.860> you'll<00:02:40.860> bleed

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
they're going to add up you'll bleed

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.100 
they're going to add up you'll bleed
heavily<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.970> with<00:02:42.450> some<00:02:42.690> of<00:02:42.780> these<00:02:42.870> different

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
heavily and with some of these different

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.990 
heavily and with some of these different
ones<00:02:43.410> there's<00:02:43.800> a<00:02:43.890> good<00:02:44.069> chance<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:44.519> they<00:02:44.790> may

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
ones there's a good chance that they may

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.340 
ones there's a good chance that they may
hit<00:02:45.209> an<00:02:45.360> artery<00:02:45.720> or<00:02:46.250> Cavatina<00:02:48.170> disabling<00:02:49.170> you

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
hit an artery or Cavatina disabling you

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.800 
hit an artery or Cavatina disabling you
technically<00:02:49.920> you're<00:02:50.069> right<00:02:50.100> on<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.459> way<00:02:53.810> so

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
technically you're right on the way so

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.800 
technically you're right on the way so
answer<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.620> question<00:02:56.069> how<00:02:57.060> dangerous<00:02:57.630> a
