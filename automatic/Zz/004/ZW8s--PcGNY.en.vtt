by any other Batman film the movie was
as<00:04:43.840> I<00:04:43.870> mentioned<00:04:44.470> a<00:04:44.590> huge<00:04:44.980> success<00:04:45.310> which<00:04:46.180> was

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
as I mentioned a huge success which was

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.270 
as I mentioned a huge success which was
unusual<00:04:46.990> for<00:04:47.050> superhero<00:04:47.680> movie<00:04:48.040> at<00:04:48.130> the<00:04:48.190> time

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
unusual for superhero movie at the time

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.640 
unusual for superhero movie at the time
most<00:04:49.120> of<00:04:49.300> them<00:04:49.450> bombed<00:04:49.690> I<00:04:50.020> mean<00:04:50.230> look<00:04:50.530> at

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
most of them bombed I mean look at

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.640 
most of them bombed I mean look at
Superman<00:04:51.310> for<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.790> quest<00:04:52.030> for<00:04:52.210> peace

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
Superman for the quest for peace

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.780

although<00:04:53.650> it<00:04:53.710> was<00:04:53.830> followed<00:04:54.190> by<00:04:54.310> some<00:04:54.520> really

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
although it was followed by some really

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.970 
although it was followed by some really
inferior<00:04:55.540> sequels<00:04:56.080> the<00:04:56.590> fact<00:04:56.800> is<00:04:56.950> that

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
inferior sequels the fact is that

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.680 
inferior sequels the fact is that
nothing<00:04:57.460> can<00:04:57.610> diminish<00:04:58.090> the<00:04:58.240> fact<00:04:58.270> that

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
nothing can diminish the fact that

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.360 
nothing can diminish the fact that
Batman<00:04:58.870> is<00:04:59.320> a<00:04:59.380> pretty<00:04:59.650> sweet<00:04:59.980> movie

of<00:05:17.560> interesting<00:05:18.010> and<00:05:18.130> I<00:05:18.190> think<00:05:18.250> that's

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
of interesting and I think that's

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.260 
of interesting and I think that's
exactly<00:05:18.700> what<00:05:19.240> Tim<00:05:19.450> Burton<00:05:19.750> was<00:05:19.780> looking<00:05:20.200> for

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
exactly what Tim Burton was looking for

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.490 
exactly what Tim Burton was looking for
something<00:05:22.270> that's<00:05:22.870> something<00:05:23.200> that<00:05:23.320> many

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
something that's something that many

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.020 
something that's something that many
fans<00:05:23.770> will<00:05:23.950> take<00:05:24.130> offense<00:05:24.430> to<00:05:24.550> and<00:05:24.850> some

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
fans will take offense to and some

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.210 
fans will take offense to and some
casual<00:05:25.420> Batman<00:05:25.840> fans<00:05:26.110> think<00:05:26.470> that's<00:05:26.980> the<00:05:27.100> way

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
casual Batman fans think that's the way

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.620 
casual Batman fans think that's the way
it<00:05:27.250> really<00:05:27.460> happened<00:05:27.610> they<00:05:28.300> don't<00:05:28.450> know<00:05:28.510> who

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
it really happened they don't know who

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.060 
it really happened they don't know who
Joe<00:05:28.840> Chill<00:05:29.110> is<00:05:29.290> or<00:05:29.470> at<00:05:29.530> least<00:05:29.650> they<00:05:29.770> didn't

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
Joe Chill is or at least they didn't

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.340 
Joe Chill is or at least they didn't
until<00:05:30.310> Batman<00:05:30.490> Begins<00:05:30.910> came<00:05:31.390> out<00:05:31.600> there's

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
until Batman Begins came out there's

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.720 
until Batman Begins came out there's
also<00:05:32.500> the<00:05:32.710> fact<00:05:32.860> that<00:05:32.980> you're<00:05:33.130> not<00:05:33.220> given<00:05:33.550> any

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:33.730 
also the fact that you're not given any

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.430 
also the fact that you're not given any
sort<00:05:33.880> of<00:05:34.000> origin<00:05:34.510> I<00:05:34.600> mean<00:05:34.810> you<00:05:34.900> do<00:05:35.050> find<00:05:35.320> out

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
sort of origin I mean you do find out

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.930 
sort of origin I mean you do find out
that<00:05:35.620> Bruce<00:05:35.890> Wayne's<00:05:36.160> parents<00:05:36.460> were<00:05:36.790> killed

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
that Bruce Wayne's parents were killed

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.730 
that Bruce Wayne's parents were killed
in<00:05:37.120> front<00:05:37.390> of<00:05:37.480> him<00:05:37.570> by<00:05:37.720> Jack<00:05:37.990> Napier<00:05:38.440> when<00:05:38.650> he

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
in front of him by Jack Napier when he

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.290 
in front of him by Jack Napier when he
was<00:05:38.860> a<00:05:38.890> teenager<00:05:39.370> and<00:05:39.520> Bruce<00:05:39.850> Wayne<00:05:40.060> was<00:05:40.240> a

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
was a teenager and Bruce Wayne was a

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.720 
was a teenager and Bruce Wayne was a
little<00:05:40.540> boy<00:05:40.690> but<00:05:41.620> the<00:05:41.770> fact<00:05:42.010> is<00:05:42.190> it<00:05:42.460> doesn't

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:42.730 
little boy but the fact is it doesn't

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.730 
little boy but the fact is it doesn't
really<00:05:42.940> go<00:05:43.180> into<00:05:43.330> how<00:05:43.540> he<00:05:43.570> became<00:05:44.020> Batman<00:05:44.560> I

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
really go into how he became Batman I

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.500 
really go into how he became Batman I
guess<00:05:45.190> Burton<00:05:45.550> didn't<00:05:45.790> want<00:05:45.970> to<00:05:46.090> saddle<00:05:46.270> the

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
guess Burton didn't want to saddle the

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.210 
guess Burton didn't want to saddle the
beginning<00:05:46.900> of<00:05:46.990> the<00:05:47.050> film<00:05:47.290> with<00:05:47.440> a<00:05:47.500> long<00:05:47.680> origin

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
beginning of the film with a long origin

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.070 
beginning of the film with a long origin
story<00:05:48.550> and<00:05:48.850> it<00:05:49.180> really<00:05:49.360> worked<00:05:49.600> for<00:05:49.720> the<00:05:49.870> time

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
story and it really worked for the time

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.750 
story and it really worked for the time
because<00:05:50.440> it<00:05:50.650> got<00:05:50.800> straightened<00:05:51.220> to<00:05:51.490> the<00:05:51.580> good

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
because it got straightened to the good

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.720 
because it got straightened to the good
stuff<00:05:52.110> although<00:05:53.110> I<00:05:53.320> mean<00:05:53.620> he<00:05:53.980> probably<00:05:54.280> could

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:54.730 
stuff although I mean he probably could

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.340 
stuff although I mean he probably could
have<00:05:54.820> done<00:05:54.880> at<00:05:55.240> least<00:05:55.540> something<00:05:56.110> like<00:05:56.320> a

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
have done at least something like a

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.260 
have done at least something like a
montage<00:05:56.980> or<00:05:57.370> something<00:05:57.790> or<00:05:57.910> at<00:05:57.970> least<00:05:58.150> he

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
montage or something or at least he

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.670 
montage or something or at least he
could<00:05:58.419> have<00:05:58.510> talked<00:05:58.810> about<00:05:58.960> how<00:05:59.260> it<00:05:59.410> became

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
could have talked about how it became

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.070 
could have talked about how it became
Batman<00:06:00.240> well<00:06:01.240> whatever<00:06:01.450> I<00:06:01.660> don't<00:06:01.810> want<00:06:02.020> to

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
Batman well whatever I don't want to

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.390 
Batman well whatever I don't want to
complain<00:06:02.380> about<00:06:02.560> the<00:06:02.770> film<00:06:02.980> too<00:06:03.130> much<00:06:03.280> because

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
complain about the film too much because

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.530 
complain about the film too much because
I<00:06:03.580> really<00:06:03.850> do<00:06:04.000> like<00:06:04.180> it

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.540 
I really do like it

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.850 
I really do like it
the<00:06:04.720> fact<00:06:04.930> is<00:06:05.080> no<00:06:05.230> matter<00:06:05.380> how<00:06:05.530> much<00:06:05.710> you

the fact is no matter how much you

the fact is no matter how much you
