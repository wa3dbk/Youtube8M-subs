00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
I see of community is dr. Cobb and we

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.120 
I see of community is dr. Cobb and we
are<00:00:02.939> incredibly<00:00:03.300> excited<00:00:03.899> today<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.440> finally

are incredibly excited today to finally
release<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:06.120> balance<00:00:06.450> Jim<00:00:06.629> if<00:00:07.290> you've<00:00:07.440> been

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
release the balance Jim if you've been

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:08.870 
release the balance Jim if you've been
following<00:00:07.859> us<00:00:07.919> for<00:00:08.040> any<00:00:08.220> length<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.519> time<00:00:08.580> you

following us for any length of time you
know<00:00:09.000> that<00:00:09.030> we<00:00:09.210> say<00:00:09.330> there<00:00:09.510> are<00:00:09.599> three<00:00:09.929> big

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
know that we say there are three big

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.680 
know that we say there are three big
rocks<00:00:10.650> to<00:00:11.340> having<00:00:11.670> maximal<00:00:12.269> health<00:00:12.480> and

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
rocks to having maximal health and

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.829 
rocks to having maximal health and
fitness<00:00:12.960> those<00:00:13.620> rocks<00:00:13.860> are<00:00:14.040> seen<00:00:14.400> well

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 
fitness those rocks are seen well

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.210 
fitness those rocks are seen well
balancing<00:00:15.839> well<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.289> moving<00:00:16.650> well<00:00:16.920> and

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
balancing well and moving well and

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.650 
balancing well and moving well and
there's<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.760> lot<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:18.240> complicated

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
there's a lot of complicated

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.120 
there's a lot of complicated
neuroscience<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.410> makes<00:00:19.560> them<00:00:19.710> all<00:00:19.859> work

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
neuroscience that makes them all work

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.460 
neuroscience that makes them all work
together<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.850> what<00:00:21.330> we<00:00:21.359> specialize<00:00:22.080> in<00:00:22.109> doing

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
together and what we specialize in doing

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.960 
together and what we specialize in doing
is<00:00:22.560> pulling<00:00:22.769> out<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.160> big<00:00:23.369> chunks<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.850> each

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
is pulling out the big chunks of each

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.370 
is pulling out the big chunks of each
one<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.269> them<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.480> showing<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.810> how<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:25.109> work

entire life can improve now about a year
ago<00:00:29.939> we<00:00:30.119> released<00:00:30.390> something<00:00:30.510> called<00:00:30.750> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
ago we released something called the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.470 
ago we released something called the
vision<00:00:31.109> gym<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.529> we<00:00:31.590> have<00:00:31.710> gotten<00:00:32.009> amazing

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
vision gym and we have gotten amazing

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.030 
vision gym and we have gotten amazing
feedback<00:00:33.480> from<00:00:33.690> people<00:00:33.989> who<00:00:34.110> have<00:00:34.230> had<00:00:34.410> huge

really an important thing to me I've
been<00:00:46.980> studying<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.489> vestibular<00:00:48.360> system<00:00:48.390> or

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
been studying the vestibular system or

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.660 
been studying the vestibular system or
the<00:00:48.870> inner<00:00:49.020> ear<00:00:49.260> system<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.739> body<00:00:49.920> for

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
the inner ear system of the body for

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.270 
the inner ear system of the body for
almost<00:00:51.210> two<00:00:51.449> decades<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.590> am<00:00:52.710> continually

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
almost two decades and I am continually

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.610 
almost two decades and I am continually

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
amazed still at just how precise our

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.160 
amazed still at just how precise our
balanced<00:00:56.399> system<00:00:56.579> needs<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.149> be<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.570> order<00:00:57.930> for

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.439 
balanced system needs to be in order for
us<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.289> be<00:00:58.440> healthy<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.949> athletic<00:00:59.039> in<00:01:00.030> fact<00:01:00.300> as

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.740 
I was preparing to do this video is
thinking<00:01:02.070> about<00:01:02.160> two<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.030> most<00:01:03.120> important

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
thinking about two of the most important

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.500 
thinking about two of the most important
cases<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.920> my<00:01:05.040> entire<00:01:05.400> career

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
cases in my entire career

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.770 
cases in my entire career
both<00:01:07.320> resulted<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.360> working<00:01:09.360> with<00:01:09.390> someone's

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
both resulted in working with someone's

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.450 
both resulted in working with someone's
balanced<00:01:10.140> system<00:01:10.290> creating<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.189> enormous

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
balanced system creating this enormous

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.460

they go up they'd be really hard to live
like<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.369> but<00:01:39.030> then<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.210> tends<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.479> pass<00:01:39.780> but

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
like that but then it tends to pass but

what<00:01:40.799> we're<00:01:40.950> going<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.189> tell<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.790> that

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
what we're going to tell you is that

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.490 
what we're going to tell you is that
there<00:01:42.360> are<00:01:42.540> probably<00:01:42.899> very<00:01:43.290> small

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
there are probably very small

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.039 
there are probably very small
degradation<00:01:44.310> in<00:01:44.909> most<00:01:45.450> people's<00:01:45.750> balance

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
degradation in most people's balance

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.410 
degradation in most people's balance
system<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.500> wins<00:01:46.740> fixed<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.909> make<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.060> huge

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
system that wins fixed can make a huge

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.910 
system that wins fixed can make a huge
difference<00:01:48.869> in<00:01:49.049> how<00:01:49.259> their<00:01:49.409> whole<00:01:49.649> body

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
difference in how their whole body

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.370 
difference in how their whole body
performs<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.790> that's<00:01:51.210> what<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.570> program<00:01:52.170> is

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
performs and that's what this program is

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.940 
performs and that's what this program is
all<00:01:52.649> about<00:01:52.790> so<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.990> shape<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.770> very

all about so the shape of this is very

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.100 
all about so the shape of this is very
similar<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.909> vision<00:01:57.180> Jim<00:01:57.329> people<00:01:57.869> ask<00:01:57.990> me

making progress doing very specific work

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.600 
making progress doing very specific work
to<00:02:25.989> discover<00:02:26.349> balance<00:02:26.800> issues<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:27.400> solve

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
to discover balance issues and solve

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.890 
to discover balance issues and solve
them<00:02:27.819> and<00:02:28.060> all<00:02:28.330> of<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.450> sudden<00:02:28.720> it's<00:02:28.840> like

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
them and all of a sudden it's like

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.300 
them and all of a sudden it's like
someone's<00:02:29.260> taking<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.590> breaks<00:02:29.860> off<00:02:30.069> your

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
someone's taking the breaks off your

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.699 
someone's taking the breaks off your
performance<00:02:30.819> so<00:02:31.420> I<00:02:31.780> believe<00:02:32.290> that<00:02:32.500> this<00:02:32.590> is

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
performance so I believe that this is

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.949 
performance so I believe that this is
something<00:02:32.980> for<00:02:33.100> everyone<00:02:33.370> now<00:02:33.670> also<00:02:34.540> as<00:02:34.870> we

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
something for everyone now also as we

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.630 
something for everyone now also as we
see<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.230> population<00:02:35.440> aging<00:02:36.340> one<00:02:36.489> of<00:02:36.550> the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
see the population aging one of the

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.400 
see the population aging one of the
things<00:02:36.760> we<00:02:36.880> continually<00:02:37.270> run<00:02:37.510> into<00:02:37.810> is<00:02:38.110> that

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
things we continually run into is that

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.930 
things we continually run into is that
people<00:02:38.860> are<00:02:39.069> more<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:39.430> more<00:02:39.550> concerned<00:02:39.880> about

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
people are more and more concerned about

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.040 
people are more and more concerned about
their<00:02:40.180> balance<00:02:40.510> because<00:02:40.660> they're<00:02:40.780> reading

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
their balance because they're reading

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.110 
their balance because they're reading
stuff<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.380> they<00:02:41.440> go<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:41.860> know<00:02:41.980> I'm<00:02:42.340> reading

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
stuff and they go you know I'm reading

stuff<00:02:43.330> on<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.690> internet<00:02:43.989> I<00:02:44.110> see<00:02:44.319> that<00:02:44.470> there's

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
stuff on the internet I see that there's

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.320

falling and falling is a big leading

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.050 
falling and falling is a big leading

it<00:02:52.330> is<00:02:52.569> and<00:02:52.950> balance<00:02:53.950> work<00:02:54.160> can<00:02:54.670> help<00:02:54.910> prevent

it is and balance work can help prevent

them<00:03:09.069> how<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.310> build<00:03:09.640> better<00:03:09.850> balance<00:03:10.299> we

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
them how to build better balance we

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.780 
them how to build better balance we
started<00:03:11.560> with<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:11.739> basic<00:03:11.860> idea<00:03:12.370> that<00:03:12.459> some

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
started with the basic idea that some

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.100 
started with the basic idea that some
people<00:03:12.819> by<00:03:13.180> this<00:03:13.239> program<00:03:13.600> are<00:03:13.840> probably

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
people by this program are probably

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.690 
people by this program are probably
going<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.290> be<00:03:14.380> very<00:03:14.410> challenged<00:03:15.280> they<00:03:15.549> may

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
going to be very challenged they may

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.729 
going to be very challenged they may
have<00:03:15.850> never<00:03:16.150> had<00:03:16.900> anyone<00:03:17.140> addressed<00:03:17.560> their

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
have never had anyone addressed their

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.170 
have never had anyone addressed their
their<00:03:18.130> balanced<00:03:18.400> system<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:18.880> they<00:03:18.940> may<00:03:19.120> be

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
their balanced system and they may be

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.630 
their balanced system and they may be
very<00:03:19.359> unsteady<00:03:19.959> we<00:03:20.290> want<00:03:20.470> them<00:03:20.590> to<00:03:20.650> be<00:03:20.739> safe<00:03:20.980> we

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
very unsteady we want them to be safe we

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.460 
very unsteady we want them to be safe we
also<00:03:21.820> are<00:03:22.570> gonna<00:03:22.690> have<00:03:22.840> people<00:03:23.019> purchase<00:03:23.380> this

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
also are gonna have people purchase this

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.440 
also are gonna have people purchase this
program<00:03:23.859> that<00:03:24.010> are<00:03:24.100> high<00:03:24.220> level<00:03:24.489> athletes<00:03:24.910> who

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
program that are high level athletes who

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.210 
program that are high level athletes who
say<00:03:25.630> I<00:03:25.810> just<00:03:25.989> want<00:03:26.109> to<00:03:26.170> have<00:03:26.320> more<00:03:26.590> athletic

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
say I just want to have more athletic

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.250 
say I just want to have more athletic
battles<00:03:27.609> so<00:03:28.209> what<00:03:28.359> we've<00:03:28.480> done<00:03:28.630> is<00:03:28.870> built<00:03:29.170> a

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
battles so what we've done is built a

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.990 
battles so what we've done is built a
program<00:03:29.590> that<00:03:29.769> shows<00:03:29.920> you<00:03:30.160> how<00:03:30.400> to<00:03:30.459> assess

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
program that shows you how to assess

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.090 
program that shows you how to assess
your<00:03:31.150> own<00:03:31.239> balance<00:03:31.630> and<00:03:31.840> build<00:03:32.320> a<00:03:32.560> progressive

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
your own balance and build a progressive

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.670 
your own balance and build a progressive
personalized<00:03:33.670> program<00:03:34.150> that<00:03:35.079> will<00:03:35.260> improve

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
personalized program that will improve

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.490 
personalized program that will improve
you<00:03:35.920> over<00:03:36.489> a<00:03:36.519> series<00:03:36.790> of<00:03:36.820> weeks<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:38.140> program

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
you over a series of weeks the program

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.979 
you over a series of weeks the program
comes<00:03:38.709> with<00:03:38.769> a<00:03:38.859> manual<00:03:39.160> DVD<00:03:39.730> it's<00:03:40.690> about<00:03:40.870> an

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
comes with a manual DVD it's about an

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.900 
comes with a manual DVD it's about an
hour<00:03:41.140> of<00:03:41.320> training<00:03:41.829> gives<00:03:42.430> you<00:03:42.549> a<00:03:42.579> lot<00:03:42.880> of

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
hour of training gives you a lot of

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.970 
hour of training gives you a lot of
different<00:03:43.060> information<00:03:43.750> and<00:03:44.019> one<00:03:44.829> of<00:03:44.890> the

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
different information and one of the

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.440 
different information and one of the
things<00:03:45.130> you'll<00:03:45.340> notice<00:03:45.459> it's<00:03:45.760> very<00:03:45.820> different

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
things you'll notice it's very different

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.270 
things you'll notice it's very different
in<00:03:46.570> our<00:03:46.780> approach<00:03:47.290> to<00:03:47.320> balance<00:03:47.709> training<00:03:47.920> is

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
in our approach to balance training is

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.650 
in our approach to balance training is
we're<00:03:48.609> not<00:03:48.700> gonna<00:03:48.790> have<00:03:48.970> you<00:03:49.060> standing<00:03:49.390> on<00:03:49.510> any

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
we're not gonna have you standing on any

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.530 
we're not gonna have you standing on any
wobbly<00:03:50.109> stuff<00:03:50.519> we<00:03:51.519> feel<00:03:51.760> like<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.239> research

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
wobbly stuff we feel like the research

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.840 
wobbly stuff we feel like the research
points<00:03:53.019> that<00:03:53.230> most<00:03:53.530> people<00:03:53.829> need<00:03:54.400> to<00:03:54.519> work<00:03:54.640> on

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
points that most people need to work on

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.120 
points that most people need to work on
standing<00:03:55.239> on<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.959> solid<00:03:56.170> ground<00:03:56.500> as<00:03:56.799> opposed

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
standing on the solid ground as opposed

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.500 
standing on the solid ground as opposed
to<00:03:57.220> shaky<00:03:57.519> ground<00:03:57.730> because<00:03:58.000> most<00:03:58.209> of<00:03:58.239> our<00:03:58.299> life

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
to shaky ground because most of our life

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.110 
to shaky ground because most of our life
is<00:03:58.660> lived<00:03:58.900> on<00:03:59.140> solid<00:03:59.500> ground<00:03:59.709> so<00:04:00.640> we're<00:04:01.030> gonna

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
is lived on solid ground so we're gonna

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.640 
is lived on solid ground so we're gonna
see<00:04:01.420> a<00:04:01.450> lot<00:04:01.690> of<00:04:01.720> stuff<00:04:01.930> going<00:04:02.200> on<00:04:02.260> with<00:04:02.470> head

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
see a lot of stuff going on with head

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.009 
see a lot of stuff going on with head
neck<00:04:02.890> movements<00:04:03.459> and<00:04:03.640> eye<00:04:04.120> movement<00:04:04.600> since<00:04:04.780> it

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
neck movements and eye movement since it

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.809 
neck movements and eye movement since it
show<00:04:05.350> you<00:04:05.410> how<00:04:05.620> those<00:04:05.829> also<00:04:06.160> correlate<00:04:06.700> to

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
show you how those also correlate to

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.309 
show you how those also correlate to
better<00:04:06.970> balance<00:04:07.150> now<00:04:07.870> that<00:04:07.989> we<00:04:08.049> take<00:04:08.170> a<00:04:08.200> look

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
better balance now that we take a look

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:09.840 
better balance now that we take a look
at<00:04:08.440> the<00:04:08.530> program<00:04:08.980> let's<00:04:09.340> talk<00:04:09.489> a<00:04:09.519> little<00:04:09.609> bit
