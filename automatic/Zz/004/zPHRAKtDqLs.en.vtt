00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.460
 hello very good to all and all today 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.620
 decided that it's a nice day to bring 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.910
 a new compilation this time having 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.379
 account the value of the section 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.730
 photographic phones with windows 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.230
 phones especially in the alumnia family 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.180
 I will comment on the ones that under my 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.340
 perception are the best editors of 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.480
 photographs for the platform I'm going to 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.590
 start with one of those who later have 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.620
 arrived and that in addition it is already a 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.240
 universal application I speak of adobe 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.800
 photoshop express from this application 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.600
 we can apply different filters 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.440
 although for some of them you have to 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.149
 go through the box 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.890
 The same thing happens when you make certain 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.450
 adjustments although most are free 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.859
 in the lower part we find the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.989
 possibility to apply a correction 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:42.269
 fast automatically undo the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.129
 setting or filter and go back to the picture 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:45.629
 original from here we can also 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.819
 save the photograph and obviously 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.190
 share through social networks or 

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:51.659
 email with whom we want the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.550
 application allows you to add borders or 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:56.069
 frame and with many options as you see 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.960
 from it it is possible to cut a 

00:00:56.069 --> 00:01:00.539
 photograph or eliminate even the eyes 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.060
 reds certainly a basic application and 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.590
 simple to use 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.240
 certainly one of the most editors 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.640
 complete and possibly the best for 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.690
 windows phones photo room that like 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.370
 that the previous one is also a 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.960
 universal application the application 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.810
 allows you to edit even images up to 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.340
 22 megapixels once selected one 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.440
 photography we can apply some of 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.420
 the 22 filters offered in addition to 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.910
 can trim and tilt to adjust the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.310
 brightness and contrast and frame in one of 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.020
 the 25 adjustable frames from the 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.610
 section pro we found the option to 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.890
 to blur part of the photograph 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.660
 write a text as well as more than 10 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.300
 professional edition hdr tools 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.760
 like tiny planets lens correction 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.130
 chromatic noise reduction change 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.170
 double exposure light leakage 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.640
 texture among others 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.710
 once edited we can save the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.150
 photography on our phone share 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.010
 through social networks or 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.750
 share it in photo room which is also 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.900
 a large community of lovers of 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.900
 Photography 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.600
 another one of the most well-known applications and 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.340
 used by the users is pixart and that 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.320
 has no doubt with a design very consistent 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.090
 with the platform in the form of times 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.250
 we found the option to apply a 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.960
 effect to a photograph which we can 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.640
 open from the gallery and even from 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.459
 our profiles on social networks like 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.200
 facebook or instagram from gallery 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.150
 we can apply different adjustments to 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.040
 any photograph as well as applying a 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.319
 effect draw on the same add 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.060
 masks insert objects that is a 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.000
 option that I love adding text 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.560
 add an edge or frame in addition to 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.840
 edit photography the application allows 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.190
 create collage and in that way combine 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.530
 several photographs of very shapes 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.170
 varied with edges and very cool boats 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.970
 as well as within the same fund that 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.799
 nothing serves to explode all our art if 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.299
 we can not show it to the world it 's because 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.470
 this we can share our 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.780
 creations in different networks 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.420
 social, we must recognize that with all 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.769
 pixart these options is without doubt 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.960
 the best options in terms of 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.310
 image editing applications 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.930
 I wanted to include one of the 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.510
 simpler applications but pretty 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.010
 complete as it is as great once 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.110
 we select a photograph we can 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.810
 Apply one of the 47 filters offered 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.210
 and 71 light effects that will revitalize 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.380
 certainly any photograph in the 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.180
 bottom we found the option 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.980
 to adjust the brightness contrast and 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.660
 saturation as well as options for 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.880
 defocus effect either model or 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.470
 circular and if we also want to frame 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.140
 the photograph the application offers up 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.660
 49 frames as large allows also 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.100
 crop and tilt the image once 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.230
 edited to the photograph we can 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.780
 save it as well as share it through 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.780
 from facebook twitter or flickr among others 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.069
 the time has come to speak of a 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.860
 of my favorites and sure of many 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.510
 of you lumia creative studio el 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.640
 Microsoft's photo editor is definitely 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.200
 one of the best options from the 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.690
 we can cut out the photograph 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.760
 adjust and even rotate apply one of 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.310
 the 12 filters that it offers to improve 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.379
 adjusting the brightness shadow intensity 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.360
 clarity and temperature or with the 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.790
 better automatic and even blur 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.260
 part of the photograph the menu of the 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.060
 bottom includes the option to 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.530
 unfocus the background highlight a 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.750
 determined color of the photograph 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.940
 remove red eyes and save the 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.650
 same from the umÃ­a creative studio no 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.239
 we can share the edited image to 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.739
 through social networks so 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.780
 we will have to go to photos and from 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.670
 there to share it in spite of it without 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.910
 doubt one of the simplest editors and 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.710
 complete 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.959
 the last application that is not the worst is 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.430
 font candy that has a design of 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.209
 the line of other apps for windows 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.350
 phones 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.330
 nothing else to enter we will have to select 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.620
 between one of the photographs taken with 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.660
 the terminal of our account 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.400
 facebook or an image of any 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.740
 another album from the same one we can 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.720
 write a text with with objects to 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.910
 that even what they do or insert 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.350
 predesigned text and possible 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.970
 also from the same application adjust 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.230
 the brightness contrast or saturation and 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.110
 apply some of the filters that 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.790
 offers to finalize font candy allows 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.730
 save the edited photograph and 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.140
