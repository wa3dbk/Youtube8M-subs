00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
have had to slow down quite quickly how

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.569 
have had to slow down quite quickly how
do<00:00:43.660> you<00:00:43.839> go<00:00:44.530> about<00:00:44.589> changing<00:00:44.890> gear<00:00:45.250> and<00:00:45.399> so<00:00:45.460> on

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
do you go about changing gear and so on

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.489 
do you go about changing gear and so on
to<00:00:45.699> make<00:00:45.730> sure<00:00:45.850> you<00:00:46.089> can<00:00:46.179> right<00:00:46.329> gear<00:00:46.570> but

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:47.499 
to make sure you can right gear but

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:49.979 
to make sure you can right gear but
anyway<00:00:47.980> let's<00:00:48.129> try<00:00:48.249> and<00:00:48.429> trace<00:00:48.879> or<00:00:49.120> twice<00:00:49.749> rode

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
anyway let's try and trace or twice rode

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:51.650 
anyway let's try and trace or twice rode
for<00:00:50.140> a<00:00:50.170> minute<00:00:50.379> it's<00:00:50.920> got<00:00:51.070> a<00:00:51.100> nice<00:00:51.219> little<00:00:51.370> nook

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
for a minute it's got a nice little nook

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.119 
for a minute it's got a nice little nook
uphill<00:00:52.660> section<00:00:53.079> which<00:00:53.530> is<00:00:53.620> quite<00:00:53.829> good<00:00:53.980> for<00:00:54.039> a

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
uphill section which is quite good for a

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.310 
uphill section which is quite good for a
test<00:00:54.339> so<00:00:54.489> I<00:00:54.780> should<00:00:55.780> be<00:00:55.839> on<00:00:55.899> the<00:00:55.989> rear<00:00:56.109> bright

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
test so I should be on the rear bright

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.869 
test so I should be on the rear bright
now<00:00:56.499> and<00:00:57.480> whoops<00:00:58.480> rolling<00:00:59.079> back<00:00:59.199> even<00:00:59.879> but

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
now and whoops rolling back even but

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:02.660 
now and whoops rolling back even but
yeah<00:01:01.390> you<00:01:01.449> literally<00:01:01.690> find<00:01:02.019> the<00:01:02.079> biting<00:01:02.350> point

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
yeah you literally find the biting point

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.880 
yeah you literally find the biting point
at<00:01:03.670> the<00:01:03.760> clutch<00:01:03.909> out<00:01:04.059> ever<00:01:04.239> so<00:01:04.390> slightly<00:01:04.890> until

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
at the clutch out ever so slightly until

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.469 
at the clutch out ever so slightly until
you<00:01:05.980> feel<00:01:06.190> it<00:01:06.280> moving<00:01:06.430> forwards<00:01:06.820> come<00:01:07.270> off<00:01:07.360> the

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
you feel it moving forwards come off the

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.440 
you feel it moving forwards come off the
rear<00:01:07.659> brake<00:01:07.899> and<00:01:08.110> off<00:01:08.710> you're<00:01:08.860> going<00:01:08.979> to<00:01:09.040> first

now off your first has got a friendly
limited<00:01:11.920> range<00:01:12.159> you<00:01:12.820> can't<00:01:13.000> do<00:01:13.119> too<00:01:13.299> much

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:13.329 
limited range you can't do too much

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:15.210 
limited range you can't do too much
about<00:01:13.659> late<00:01:13.869> so<00:01:14.020> if<00:01:14.619> you<00:01:14.740> want<00:01:14.890> to<00:01:14.920> shift<00:01:15.100> in

they<00:01:53.079> don't<00:01:53.229> wonder<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.500> Sun<00:01:53.649> you<00:01:53.740> slow<00:01:53.920> down

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
they don't wonder the Sun you slow down

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.679 
they don't wonder the Sun you slow down
I'll<00:01:54.460> just<00:01:54.490> flip<00:01:54.789> off<00:01:54.969> ever<00:01:55.240> so<00:01:55.420> slightly

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
I'll just flip off ever so slightly

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.870 
I'll just flip off ever so slightly
rolled<00:01:55.960> off<00:01:56.079> the<00:01:56.109> throttle<00:01:56.670> change<00:01:57.670> down<00:01:57.850> a

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
rolled off the throttle change down a

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.160 
rolled off the throttle change down a
gear<00:01:58.090> let<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.450> clutch<00:01:58.630> it<00:01:58.750> back<00:01:58.840> out<00:01:59.020> and

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
gear let the clutch it back out and

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.039 
gear let the clutch it back out and
there's<00:01:59.380> no<00:01:59.530> breaking<00:02:00.100> involved<00:02:00.520> it's<00:02:00.640> older

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
there's no breaking involved it's older

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.219 
there's no breaking involved it's older
so<00:02:02.049> I'm

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
so I'm

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:04.870 
so I'm
that's<00:02:03.799> pretty<00:02:03.979> much<00:02:04.130> it<00:02:04.399> really<00:02:04.549> just

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
that's pretty much it really just

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.539 
that's pretty much it really just
showing<00:02:05.240> you<00:02:05.329> the<00:02:05.390> basic<00:02:05.719> controls<00:02:06.200> of<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.549> of

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
showing you the basic controls of the of

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.130 
showing you the basic controls of the of
how<00:02:07.729> the<00:02:07.789> clashing<00:02:08.209> gears<00:02:08.420> work<00:02:08.629> you<00:02:09.019> don't

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
how the clashing gears work you don't

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.389 
how the clashing gears work you don't
have<00:02:09.229> to<00:02:09.379> pull<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.590> clutch<00:02:09.769> all<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.039> way<00:02:10.280> in

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
have to pull the clutch all the way in

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.479 
have to pull the clutch all the way in
probably<00:02:11.209> about<00:02:11.300> half<00:02:11.540> way<00:02:11.810> would<00:02:11.989> do<00:02:12.489> but

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
probably about half way would do but

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:14.949 
probably about half way would do but
once<00:02:13.640> you<00:02:13.760> know<00:02:13.790> where<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.239> binding<00:02:14.599> point<00:02:14.750> or

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
once you know where the binding point or

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.589 
once you know where the binding point or
where<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.170> friction<00:02:15.349> point<00:02:15.650> is<00:02:16.390> you'll<00:02:17.390> get<00:02:17.540> a

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
where the friction point is you'll get a

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.300 
where the friction point is you'll get a
rough<00:02:17.750> idea<00:02:17.870> of<00:02:18.140> where<00:02:18.349> the<00:02:18.830> actual<00:02:19.010> clutch

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
rough idea of where the actual clutch

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.400 
rough idea of where the actual clutch
disengages<00:02:20.920> from<00:02:22.599> from<00:02:23.599> the<00:02:23.720> rear<00:02:23.840> wheel<00:02:24.019> as

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
disengages from from the rear wheel as

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.790 
disengages from from the rear wheel as
it<00:02:24.530> were<00:02:24.650> I<00:02:26.080> know<00:02:27.080> I<00:02:27.230> haven't<00:02:27.410> got<00:02:27.590> a<00:02:27.620> clue

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
it were I know I haven't got a clue

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.140 
it were I know I haven't got a clue
where<00:02:28.069> I'm<00:02:28.160> going<00:02:28.370> this<00:02:28.459> could<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:28.760> be<00:02:28.880> a<00:02:28.910> dead

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
where I'm going this could to be a dead

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.850 
where I'm going this could to be a dead

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
to keep your distance and maybe possibly

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.309 
to keep your distance and maybe possibly
keep<00:02:46.459> your<00:02:46.610> speed<00:02:46.849> down<00:02:47.030> that's<00:02:47.269> a<00:02:47.630> good<00:02:48.140> point

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.950 

I<00:03:02.250> want<00:03:02.850> to<00:03:02.910> find<00:03:03.060> some<00:03:03.180> traffic<00:03:03.330> now<00:03:03.540> so<00:03:03.780> when

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
I want to find some traffic now so when

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.110 
I want to find some traffic now so when
I<00:03:04.230> thought<00:03:04.500> she<00:03:04.650> show<00:03:04.800> you<00:03:04.830> what<00:03:05.040> I'm<00:03:05.160> talking

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
and then read you on it when we got some

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.540 
and then read you on it when we got some
traffic<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:11.880> knock<00:03:12.390> about<00:03:12.480> with<00:03:13.130> okay<00:03:14.130> join<00:03:14.460> me

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
traffic to knock about with okay join me

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.760 
traffic to knock about with okay join me
in<00:03:14.610> a<00:03:14.640> minute<00:03:14.820> so<00:03:15.060> back<00:03:15.870> on<00:03:16.020> solute<00:03:16.380> now<00:03:16.470> we<00:03:16.650> got

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
in a minute so back on solute now we got

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.500 
in a minute so back on solute now we got
some<00:03:16.950> traffic<00:03:17.130> in<00:03:17.340> front<00:03:17.490> of<00:03:17.580> us<00:03:17.670> now<00:03:17.760> so<00:03:17.790> what

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
some traffic in front of us now so what

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.640 
some traffic in front of us now so what
I'm<00:03:18.630> basically<00:03:18.660> doing<00:03:18.960> here<00:03:19.230> I'm<00:03:19.320> traveling

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
I'm basically doing here I'm traveling

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.560 
I'm basically doing here I'm traveling
roughly<00:03:19.950> as<00:03:20.640> I<00:03:20.760> said<00:03:20.940> it's<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.150> slot<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.450> other

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
roughly as I said it's a slot the other

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.980 
roughly as I said it's a slot the other
30<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.710> I'm<00:03:22.860> probably<00:03:23.070> in<00:03:23.310> Top<00:03:23.520> Gear<00:03:23.750> but<00:03:24.750> some

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
30 and I'm probably in Top Gear but some

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.650 
30 and I'm probably in Top Gear but some
a<00:03:25.230> song<00:03:25.850> gradually<00:03:26.850> just<00:03:26.880> thought<00:03:27.300> enough<00:03:27.510> the

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
a song gradually just thought enough the

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.320 
a song gradually just thought enough the
throttle<00:03:27.990> and<00:03:28.560> totally<00:03:29.190> fine<00:03:29.430> down<00:03:29.700> I'm<00:03:30.120> also

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
throttle and totally fine down I'm also

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.260 
throttle and totally fine down I'm also
changing<00:03:30.690> down<00:03:30.960> a<00:03:31.020> gear<00:03:31.260> if<00:03:31.440> you<00:03:31.560> say<00:03:31.800> yeah

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
changing down a gear if you say yeah

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.140 
changing down a gear if you say yeah
five<00:03:33.270> more<00:03:33.540> now<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:33.930> so<00:03:34.640> gently<00:03:35.640> squeezing<00:03:35.970> on

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
five more now and so gently squeezing on

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.060 
five more now and so gently squeezing on
the<00:03:36.240> front<00:03:36.450> brake<00:03:36.660> as<00:03:36.840> well<00:03:36.870> should<00:03:37.860> use<00:03:38.040> a

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
the front brake as well should use a

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.500 
the front brake as well should use a
rear<00:03:38.280> as<00:03:38.430> well<00:03:38.550> but<00:03:38.730> I'm<00:03:38.940> so<00:03:39.150> used<00:03:39.180> to<00:03:39.390> the

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
rear as well but I'm so used to the

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.270 
rear as well but I'm so used to the
front<00:03:39.720> I<00:03:39.840> don't<00:03:40.560> use<00:03:40.710> the<00:03:40.830> front<00:03:41.010> more<00:03:41.130> than

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
front I don't use the front more than

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.130 
front I don't use the front more than
the<00:03:41.370> back<00:03:41.550> so<00:03:42.300> now<00:03:42.450> I'm<00:03:42.570> thinking<00:03:42.990> I'm<00:03:43.110> in

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
the back so now I'm thinking I'm in

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.440 
the back so now I'm thinking I'm in
second<00:03:43.890> gear<00:03:43.920> not<00:03:44.160> too<00:03:44.310> sure<00:03:44.520> yet<00:03:44.550> but<00:03:45.330> we're

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
second gear not too sure yet but we're

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
second gear not too sure yet but we're
coming<00:03:45.660> to<00:03:45.720> a<00:03:45.780> stop<00:03:45.930> and<00:03:46.110> I<00:03:46.140> think<00:03:46.290> I'm<00:03:46.380> gonna

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
coming to a stop and I think I'm gonna

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.220 
coming to a stop and I think I'm gonna
turn<00:03:46.740> right<00:03:46.980> so<00:03:47.250> or<00:03:48.120> come<00:03:48.300> to<00:03:48.330> stop<00:03:48.690> now

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
turn right so or come to stop now

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.450 
turn right so or come to stop now
and<00:03:49.490> put<00:03:50.490> both<00:03:50.640> brakes<00:03:51.420> on<00:03:51.600> and<00:03:52.200> then<00:03:52.460> switch

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
and put both brakes on and then switch

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.880 
and put both brakes on and then switch
down<00:03:53.640> to<00:03:53.700> first<00:03:54.000> gear<00:03:54.290> it's<00:03:55.290> not<00:03:55.440> that's<00:03:55.710> not<00:03:55.800> a

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
down to first gear it's not that's not a

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.260 
down to first gear it's not that's not a
bad<00:03:56.100> thing<00:03:56.130> you<00:03:56.730> didn't<00:03:56.910> have<00:03:57.000> to<00:03:57.090> be<00:03:57.180> in

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
bad thing you didn't have to be in

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.600 
bad thing you didn't have to be in
exactly<00:03:57.690> as<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:58.110> right<00:03:58.290> gear<00:03:58.530> at<00:03:59.100> all<00:03:59.220> times

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
exactly as the right gear at all times

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.220 
exactly as the right gear at all times
especially<00:04:00.420> you're<00:04:00.780> going<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:00.960> come<00:04:01.080> to<00:04:01.200> a

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
especially you're going to come to a

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.180 
especially you're going to come to a
stop<00:04:01.530> like<00:04:02.100> again<00:04:02.370> I<00:04:02.400> can<00:04:02.840> stop<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:04.070> see<00:04:05.070> it's

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
stop like again I can stop and see it's

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.470 
stop like again I can stop and see it's
literally<00:04:05.430> neutral<00:04:05.850> there<00:04:06.000> so<00:04:06.120> I<00:04:06.180> know<00:04:06.300> I'm<00:04:06.360> in

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
literally neutral there so I know I'm in

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.210 
literally neutral there so I know I'm in
first<00:04:06.660> again<00:04:07.050> you<00:04:07.560> can<00:04:07.650> always<00:04:07.740> have<00:04:07.860> a<00:04:07.920> double

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
first again you can always have a double

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.010 
first again you can always have a double
press<00:04:08.790> of<00:04:08.940> the<00:04:09.000> leaves<00:04:09.180> to<00:04:09.330> make<00:04:09.450> sure<00:04:09.600> it's

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
press of the leaves to make sure it's

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.560 
press of the leaves to make sure it's
definitely<00:04:10.350> down<00:04:10.440> into<00:04:10.740> first<00:04:10.980> and<00:04:11.390> then<00:04:12.390> as

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
definitely down into first and then as

ever so slightly we're only talking a

in<00:04:29.640> a<00:04:30.210> bit<00:04:30.330> cheeky<00:04:30.510> you're<00:04:30.750> getting<00:04:30.900> between

in a bit cheeky you're getting between

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.720 
in a bit cheeky you're getting between
two<00:04:31.260> cars

two cars

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.300 
two cars
maybe<00:04:32.730> so<00:04:32.880> slightly<00:04:33.120> on<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.330> floor<00:04:33.630> oops<00:04:34.310> and

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
maybe so slightly on the floor oops and

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.800 
maybe so slightly on the floor oops and
again<00:04:35.730> don't<00:04:35.880> go<00:04:36.030> too<00:04:36.210> close<00:04:36.360> to<00:04:36.540> the<00:04:36.630> car<00:04:36.750> in

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
again don't go too close to the car in

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.960 
again don't go too close to the car in
front<00:04:37.130> you<00:04:38.130> can<00:04:38.250> hear<00:04:38.340> the<00:04:38.430> rest<00:04:38.550> pick<00:04:38.760> it<00:04:38.880> up

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970

front you can hear the rest pick it up
if<00:04:39.090> you<00:04:39.120> does<00:04:39.720> that<00:04:39.750> too<00:04:39.990> high<00:04:40.260> I'll<00:04:40.560> change<00:04:40.950> up

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
but don't change up too much just to

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.909 
but don't change up too much just to
give<00:04:43.710> it<00:04:43.830> you<00:04:44.640> could<00:04:44.790> old<00:04:45.200> feel<00:04:46.200> good<00:04:46.620> feel<00:04:46.860> of

give it you could old feel good feel of

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.090 
give it you could old feel good feel of
the<00:04:47.460> wave<00:04:47.580> footwork<00:04:48.030> safety<00:04:48.390> or<00:04:49.080> which<00:04:49.200> or<00:04:49.590> how

the actual gears or engine feels at that

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.140 
the actual gears or engine feels at that
particular<00:04:52.860> time<00:04:53.250> see<00:04:53.550> now<00:04:53.700> it<00:04:53.760> doesn't<00:04:54.000> feel

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
particular time see now it doesn't feel

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.120 
particular time see now it doesn't feel
too<00:04:54.270> stressed<00:04:54.750> at<00:04:54.840> the<00:04:54.870> moment<00:04:54.930> and<00:04:55.770> if<00:04:55.890> I<00:04:55.950> dip

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
too stressed at the moment and if I dip

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.400 
too stressed at the moment and if I dip
its<00:04:56.310> ever<00:04:56.490> so<00:04:56.700> slightly<00:04:56.940> it<00:04:57.900> slows<00:04:58.169> down<00:04:58.200> a

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
its ever so slightly it slows down a

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:59.810 
its ever so slightly it slows down a
little<00:04:58.530> bit<00:04:58.830> because<00:04:59.190> you<00:04:59.400> don't<00:04:59.430> get<00:04:59.610> much

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
little bit because you don't get much

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.310 
little bit because you don't get much
eight<00:05:00.030> engine<00:05:00.360> braking<00:05:00.570> the<00:05:00.810> one<00:05:00.930> to<00:05:01.080> five
