 with heavy metal that works and I feel 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.510
 me so incredibly free while at 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.370
 classical music always has to be in 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.890
 stay in a certain frame 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.890

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.649
 to reach as a classical pianist 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.610

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.509

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.470
 Well, the only instrument I have 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.119

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.070
 I have a few bass guitar and 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.460
 taken hours but I was not tall 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.259
 enough 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.460
 That's why I had the metal songs 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.460
 I liked the piano 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:48.729

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.470
 a few days at a gig in hamburg 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.959
 I like the music and I have it 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.730
 somehow the internet is discovered and am 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.810
 it has come down to it like ourselves 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.849
 and residents their technical 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.439
 skills what i find great provider 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.409
 it's the music that's very clear we are 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:35.930
 middle and that's a bit 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:38.569
 crossover is actually and for netzer 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.329
 that's something very special 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.650
 It's not that often that it's so individual 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.650
 the heavy metal interprets 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.290
 The artist name of the 35 year old is on the 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:52.000
 stage program privately admits and 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.000
 she is pretty shy 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.400
 to play audience is somehow afraid 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.739
 scary and makes me nervous though 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.930
 if I overcome this tension then 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.599
 I get a real kick that is 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.280
 very intense emotionally I think so 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.349
 I'm more balanced when I'm the heavy one 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.030
 Metal numbers games and I feel 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.769
 not so bad at shy 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.940
 to be because I'm easy on the piano 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.940
 can do wild things 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:22.060
