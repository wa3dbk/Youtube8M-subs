variables<00:00:02.250> are<00:00:02.490> a<00:00:02.520> way<00:00:02.760> of<00:00:03.060> storing<00:00:03.750> numbers

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
variables are a way of storing numbers

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.639 
variables are a way of storing numbers
on<00:00:04.470> your<00:00:04.620> robots<00:00:05.100> during<00:00:05.730> text<00:00:06.450> being<00:00:07.290> able<00:00:07.410> to

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
on your robots during text being able to

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.879 
on your robots during text being able to
manipulate<00:00:07.830> those<00:00:08.490> numbers<00:00:08.970> and<00:00:09.150> text<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:09.960> do

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
manipulate those numbers and text and do

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.030 
manipulate those numbers and text and do
a<00:00:11.280> lot<00:00:11.580> of<00:00:11.610> very<00:00:12.059> advanced<00:00:12.450> things<00:00:12.920> we<00:00:13.920> can

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
a lot of very advanced things we can

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.269 
a lot of very advanced things we can
only<00:00:14.190> just<00:00:14.519> briefly<00:00:14.880> touch<00:00:15.179> on<00:00:15.450> the

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
only just briefly touch on the

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.500 
only just briefly touch on the
possibilities<00:00:17.279> here<00:00:17.520> in<00:00:17.609> this<00:00:17.699> tutorial<00:00:17.880> but

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
possibilities here in this tutorial but

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.070 
possibilities here in this tutorial but
it<00:00:18.779> at<00:00:18.900> least<00:00:18.960> give<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.410> place<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.250> start

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
it at least give you a place to start

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.179 
it at least give you a place to start
we're<00:00:22.080> going<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.260> write<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.439> program<00:00:22.740> that

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
we're going to write a program that

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.710 
we're going to write a program that
counts<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.609> number<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.880> times<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.449> touch

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
counts the number of times that a touch

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.560 
counts the number of times that a touch
sensors<00:00:25.080> been<00:00:25.289> pressed<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.210> so<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.359> first

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
sensors been pressed and so the first

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.179 
sensors been pressed and so the first
thing<00:00:27.720> when<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:27.869> do<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.349> go<00:00:28.560> up<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.920> Edit

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
thing when you do is go up to the Edit

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.380 
thing when you do is go up to the Edit
menu<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.689> define<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> variable<00:00:31.880> it<00:00:32.880> starts<00:00:33.270> out

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
menu and define a variable it starts out

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.780 
menu and define a variable it starts out
with<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.750> few<00:00:34.110> variables<00:00:34.500> predefined<00:00:35.280> for<00:00:35.610> you

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
with a few variables predefined for you

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.760 
with a few variables predefined for you
but<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.540> really<00:00:36.750> want<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.050> create<00:00:37.500> your<00:00:37.739> own

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
but you really want to create your own

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.520 
but you really want to create your own
and<00:00:38.610> one<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.329> main<00:00:39.510> reasons<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.379> want

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
and one of the main reasons is you want

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.650 
and one of the main reasons is you want
to<00:00:40.620> name<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.160> something<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.790> you'll

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
to name it something that you'll

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.770 
to name it something that you'll
remember<00:00:43.160> what<00:00:44.160> it's<00:00:44.309> about<00:00:44.570> months<00:00:45.570> later

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
remember what it's about months later

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.170 
remember what it's about months later
after<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.200> come<00:00:46.379> back<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.649> your<00:00:46.710> program<00:00:47.180> like

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
after you come back to your program like

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.090 
after you come back to your program like
I'm<00:00:48.329> going<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.629> be<00:00:48.930> counting<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.829> number<00:00:50.070> of

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
I'm going to be counting the number of

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.069 
I'm going to be counting the number of
times<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.489> touch<00:00:50.700> sensors<00:00:51.059> been<00:00:51.239> pressed<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:51.840> I

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
times a touch sensors been pressed so I

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.790 
times a touch sensors been pressed so I
could<00:00:52.469> just<00:00:52.680> call<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:52.890> count<00:00:53.629> but<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:55.559> know<00:00:55.680> in

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
could just call it count but you know in

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.260 
could just call it count but you know in
six<00:00:56.010> months<00:00:56.309> am<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.460> gonna<00:00:56.610> remember<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.000> it's

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
six months am I gonna remember that it's

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.790 
six months am I gonna remember that it's
a<00:00:57.360> touch<00:00:57.600> sensor<00:00:58.020> count<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.500> I'm<00:00:58.590> talking

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
a touch sensor count that I'm talking

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.549 
a touch sensor count that I'm talking
about<00:00:59.160> probably<00:01:00.090> not<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.410> much

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
about probably not and so it's much

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.990 
about probably not and so it's much
better<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.859> call<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.190> something<00:01:02.640> really

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
better to call it something really

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.320 
better to call it something really
descriptive<00:01:03.600> like<00:01:03.809> touch<00:01:04.350> count<00:01:05.150> you<00:01:06.150> could

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
descriptive like touch count you could

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.750 
descriptive like touch count you could
get<00:01:06.540> kind<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.409> wacky<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.979> silly<00:01:08.220> here<00:01:08.549> you

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
get kind of wacky and silly here you

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.490 
get kind of wacky and silly here you
could<00:01:08.939> name<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.540> fuzzy<00:01:10.439> bunny<00:01:10.740> tails<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:11.970> I

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
could name this fuzzy bunny tails but I

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.109 
could name this fuzzy bunny tails but I
would<00:01:13.500> really<00:01:14.130> recommend<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.760> don't

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
would really recommend that you don't

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.840 
would really recommend that you don't
because<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:16.380> six<00:01:16.860> months<00:01:16.920> you're<00:01:17.580> probably

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
because in six months you're probably

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.700 
because in six months you're probably
not<00:01:18.060> gonna<00:01:18.180> remember<00:01:18.509> what<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.080> heck<00:01:19.229> fuzzy

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
not gonna remember what the heck fuzzy

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.980 
not gonna remember what the heck fuzzy
bunny<00:01:19.920> tails<00:01:20.250> are<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.390> novelty<00:01:21.810> will

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
bunny tails are and the novelty will

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.830 
bunny tails are and the novelty will
wear<00:01:22.049> off<00:01:22.380> pretty<00:01:22.650> fast<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:23.450> much<00:01:24.450> better<00:01:24.689> to

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
wear off pretty fast so much better to

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.450 
wear off pretty fast so much better to
cause<00:01:25.020> something<00:01:25.259> descriptive<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.130> save

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
cause something descriptive and save

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.850 
cause something descriptive and save
your<00:01:26.640> creativity<00:01:27.299> for<00:01:27.659> someplace<00:01:28.320> else

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.899 

variables<00:01:31.860> can<00:01:32.040> be<00:01:32.070> three<00:01:32.400> different<00:01:32.670> types

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
variables can be three different types

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.050 
variables can be three different types
logic<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:34.110> know<00:01:34.170> yes/no<00:01:34.860> true/false<00:01:35.189> kinds

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
logic you know yes/no true/false kinds

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.780 
logic you know yes/no true/false kinds
of<00:01:36.150> things<00:01:36.619> numbers<00:01:37.619> which<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.549> what<00:01:38.700> I'm

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
of things numbers which is what I'm

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.690 
of things numbers which is what I'm
gonna<00:01:38.939> want<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.450> number<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:41.189> value<00:01:41.490> between

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
gonna want a number is a value between

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.450 
gonna want a number is a value between
negative<00:01:42.270> two<00:01:42.840> billion<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.590> positive<00:01:44.280> two

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
negative two billion and positive two

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.039 
negative two billion and positive two
billion<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.799> text<00:01:46.850> letters<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.090> numbers<00:01:48.659> all

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
billion and text letters and numbers all

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.590 
billion and text letters and numbers all
strung<00:01:49.439> together<00:01:49.790> mainly<00:01:50.790> for<00:01:51.090> use<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
strung together mainly for use on the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.560 
strung together mainly for use on the
display<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.259> robot<00:01:52.970> so<00:01:53.970> I'm<00:01:54.240> gonna<00:01:54.360> make<00:01:54.540> a

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
display of the robot so I'm gonna make a

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.030 
display of the robot so I'm gonna make a
number<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:55.920> we'll<00:01:56.310> close<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:57.799> so<00:01:58.799> I'm<00:01:58.890> going

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
number and we'll close that so I'm going

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.350 
number and we'll close that so I'm going
to<00:01:59.070> count<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.670> number<00:01:59.909> of<00:01:59.939> times<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.299> a

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
to count the number of times that a

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.090 
to count the number of times that a
touch<00:02:00.570> sensor<00:02:00.899> has<00:02:01.079> been<00:02:01.110> pressed<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.860> I'm

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
touch sensor has been pressed so I'm

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.670 
touch sensor has been pressed so I'm
gonna<00:02:02.280> want<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.549> loop<00:02:03.110> so<00:02:04.110> I'll<00:02:04.170> bring<00:02:04.320> my<00:02:04.469> loop

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
gonna want to loop so I'll bring my loop

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.910 
gonna want to loop so I'll bring my loop
out<00:02:05.299> and<00:02:06.299> then<00:02:06.540> variables<00:02:07.229> show<00:02:07.500> up<00:02:07.619> here's

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
out and then variables show up here's

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.380 
out and then variables show up here's
the<00:02:08.129> suitcase

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
the suitcase

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.270 
the suitcase
drag<00:02:09.960> the<00:02:10.110> suitcase<00:02:10.289> out<00:02:12.590> now<00:02:13.590> I'm<00:02:13.890> gonna<00:02:14.040> want

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
drag the suitcase out now I'm gonna want

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.790 
drag the suitcase out now I'm gonna want
to<00:02:14.340> count<00:02:14.580> touch<00:02:14.880> sensor<00:02:15.270> presses<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.170> so

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
to count touch sensor presses and so

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.730 
to count touch sensor presses and so
that's<00:02:17.490> gonna<00:02:17.610> be<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.820> weight<00:02:18.200> so<00:02:19.200> I'll<00:02:19.590> bring

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
that's gonna be a weight so I'll bring

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.030 
that's gonna be a weight so I'll bring
my<00:02:19.890> weight<00:02:20.070> out<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:21.810> we'll<00:02:22.500> just<00:02:22.680> say<00:02:22.800> it's<00:02:22.950> on

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
my weight out and we'll just say it's on

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.680 
my weight out and we'll just say it's on
touch<00:02:23.220> sensor<00:02:24.290> is<00:02:25.290> on<00:02:25.560> port<00:02:25.860> 2<00:02:26.330> you'll<00:02:27.330> see<00:02:27.510> why

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
touch sensor is on port 2 you'll see why

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.410 
touch sensor is on port 2 you'll see why
in<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.870> little<00:02:28.050> bit<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:29.670> I'm<00:02:29.910> gonna<00:02:30.030> count<00:02:30.240> the

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
in a little bit and I'm gonna count the

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.120 
in a little bit and I'm gonna count the
number<00:02:30.630> of<00:02:30.660> times<00:02:30.720> it's<00:02:31.080> been<00:02:31.140> bumped<00:02:31.740> pressed

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
number of times it's been bumped pressed

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.690 
number of times it's been bumped pressed
and<00:02:32.340> released<00:02:33.740> so<00:02:34.740> after<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.220> touch<00:02:35.400> sensor

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
and released so after the touch sensor

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.310 
and released so after the touch sensor
has<00:02:35.820> been<00:02:35.850> pressed<00:02:36.180> released<00:02:36.660> its<00:02:36.900> gonna<00:02:37.080> go

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
has been pressed released its gonna go

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.060 
has been pressed released its gonna go
here<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.190> do<00:02:38.580> something<00:02:38.880> with<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.000> variable

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
here and do something with a variable

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.380 
here and do something with a variable
it's<00:02:41.070> gonna<00:02:41.400> want<00:02:41.640> to<00:02:41.700> be<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:41.940> touch<00:02:42.120> count

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
it's gonna want to be the touch count

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.110 
it's gonna want to be the touch count
variable<00:02:42.690> that<00:02:43.050> we<00:02:43.140> defined<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.970> can

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
variable that we defined and you can

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.940 
variable that we defined and you can
either<00:02:45.300> read<00:02:45.600> or<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:45.900> can<00:02:46.140> write<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.500> it<00:02:46.680> I'm

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
either read or you can write to it I'm

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.330 
either read or you can write to it I'm
gonna<00:02:47.190> read<00:02:47.459> from<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:48.500> now<00:02:49.500> I<00:02:49.560> want<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.770> add<00:02:49.950> 1

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
gonna read from it now I want to add 1

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.860 
gonna read from it now I want to add 1
to<00:02:50.580> it<00:02:50.610> because<00:02:50.880> I'm<00:02:51.000> counting<00:02:51.270> the<00:02:51.570> number<00:02:51.840> of

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
to it because I'm counting the number of

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.390 
to it because I'm counting the number of
times<00:02:51.959> that<00:02:52.380> touch<00:02:52.860> sensors<00:02:53.190> have<00:02:53.310> been

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
times that touch sensors have been

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.729 
times that touch sensors have been
pressed<00:02:53.900> so<00:02:54.900> we'll<00:02:55.260> go<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.560> math<00:02:55.770> block

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
pressed so we'll go to the math block

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.430 
pressed so we'll go to the math block
now<00:02:58.739> math<00:02:59.010> blocks<00:02:59.340> can<00:03:00.239> do<00:03:00.420> you<00:03:00.840> know<00:03:00.930> basic

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
now math blocks can do you know basic

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.520 
now math blocks can do you know basic
math<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:02.489> so<00:03:02.910> I'm<00:03:03.270> gonna<00:03:03.450> add<00:03:03.840> something<00:03:04.230> to

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
math and so I'm gonna add something to

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:05.290 
math and so I'm gonna add something to
it

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
it

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.210 
it
it<00:03:06.300> starts<00:03:06.660> out<00:03:06.780> just<00:03:06.840> having<00:03:07.440> two<00:03:07.620> constants

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
it starts out just having two constants

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.490 
it starts out just having two constants
that<00:03:08.250> I<00:03:08.400> entered<00:03:08.550> here<00:03:09.090> but<00:03:09.390> I'm<00:03:10.020> more

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
that I entered here but I'm more

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.080 
that I entered here but I'm more
interested<00:03:10.560> in<00:03:11.070> getting<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.459> value<00:03:11.760> for<00:03:11.970> my

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
interested in getting the value for my

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.600 
interested in getting the value for my
variable<00:03:12.630> so<00:03:13.350> I'm<00:03:13.500> gonna<00:03:13.680> click<00:03:13.980> over<00:03:14.280> there

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
variable so I'm gonna click over there

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.720 
variable so I'm gonna click over there
on<00:03:15.299> that<00:03:15.600> terminal<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:16.560> wire<00:03:16.769> that<00:03:17.070> into<00:03:17.549> my

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
on that terminal and wire that into my

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.910 
on that terminal and wire that into my
math<00:03:17.910> block<00:03:19.250> now<00:03:20.250> you'll<00:03:20.430> notice<00:03:20.640> that<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.480> a

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
math block now you'll notice that the a

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.440 
math block now you'll notice that the a
term<00:03:22.920> is<00:03:23.190> grayed<00:03:23.459> out<00:03:23.489> it's<00:03:24.239> grayed<00:03:24.420> out

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
term is grayed out it's grayed out

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.840 
term is grayed out it's grayed out
because<00:03:24.810> it's<00:03:25.590> already<00:03:26.280> got<00:03:26.459> getting<00:03:26.730> its

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
because it's already got getting its

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.550 
because it's already got getting its
value<00:03:27.180> from<00:03:27.299> someplace<00:03:27.690> else<00:03:27.930> it's<00:03:28.290> getting

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
value from someplace else it's getting

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.259 
value from someplace else it's getting
it<00:03:28.620> from<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:28.980> variable<00:03:30.320> and<00:03:31.489> my<00:03:32.489> B<00:03:32.700> term<00:03:32.730> I

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
it from the variable and my B term I

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.330 
it from the variable and my B term I
could<00:03:33.450> get<00:03:33.630> from<00:03:33.840> someplace<00:03:34.140> else<00:03:34.350> too<00:03:34.709> but<00:03:35.040> in

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
could get from someplace else too but in

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.710 
could get from someplace else too but in
my<00:03:35.580> case<00:03:35.640> I<00:03:36.030> just<00:03:36.060> want<00:03:36.269> to<00:03:36.450> add<00:03:36.600> one<00:03:38.540> so<00:03:39.540> now

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
my case I just want to add one so now

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.199 
my case I just want to add one so now
this<00:03:40.140> terminal<00:03:40.530> is<00:03:40.590> gonna<00:03:40.860> have<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.640> result

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
this terminal is gonna have the result

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.140 
this terminal is gonna have the result
of<00:03:42.390> that<00:03:42.540> high<00:03:43.500> high<00:03:44.160> end<00:03:44.190> math<00:03:44.610> that<00:03:44.850> we<00:03:44.940> just

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
of that high high end math that we just

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.509 
of that high high end math that we just
did<00:03:45.360> which<00:03:45.630> is<00:03:45.660> adding<00:03:46.230> one<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:46.590> something<00:03:46.950> so

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
did which is adding one to something so

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.520 
did which is adding one to something so
it's<00:03:47.670> adding<00:03:47.790> one<00:03:48.120> to<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.299> variable<00:03:48.540> and<00:03:49.140> now

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
it's adding one to the variable and now

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.759 
it's adding one to the variable and now
it's<00:03:49.739> gonna<00:03:49.890> present<00:03:50.640> that<00:03:50.790> result<00:03:51.120> here<00:03:51.769> well

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
it's gonna present that result here well

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.350 
it's gonna present that result here well
the<00:03:53.070> first<00:03:53.280> thing<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:53.459> want<00:03:53.640> to<00:03:53.700> do<00:03:53.790> is<00:03:53.940> put<00:03:54.209> that

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
the first thing I want to do is put that

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.390 
the first thing I want to do is put that
back<00:03:54.720> into<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.140> variable<00:03:55.620> because<00:03:56.010> I<00:03:56.130> want<00:03:56.310> to

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
back into the variable because I want to

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.190 
back into the variable because I want to
have<00:03:56.549> that<00:03:56.700> variable<00:03:57.180> increment<00:03:57.450> start<00:03:58.080> out

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
have that variable increment start out

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.990 
have that variable increment start out
at<00:03:58.380> zero<00:03:58.410> and<00:03:58.799> go<00:03:58.860> one<00:03:59.100> two<00:03:59.130> three<00:03:59.340> four<00:03:59.760> five

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
at zero and go one two three four five

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.509 
at zero and go one two three four five
every<00:04:00.360> time<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.720> things<00:04:00.900> been<00:04:01.110> pressed<00:04:01.519> so

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
every time the things been pressed so

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.140 
every time the things been pressed so
let's<00:04:03.060> go<00:04:03.209> get<00:04:03.450> another<00:04:03.709> variable<00:04:04.709> block<00:04:05.150> in

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
let's go get another variable block in

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.930 
let's go get another variable block in
this<00:04:06.750> case<00:04:06.989> we're<00:04:07.170> gonna<00:04:07.230> write<00:04:07.620> into<00:04:08.040> it<00:04:08.070> so

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
this case we're gonna write into it so

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.449 
this case we're gonna write into it so
I'll<00:04:09.000> say<00:04:09.209> I'm<00:04:09.810> writing<00:04:10.049> and<00:04:10.650> it's<00:04:11.100> the<00:04:11.250> touch

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
I'll say I'm writing and it's the touch

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.630 
I'll say I'm writing and it's the touch
count<00:04:11.760> number<00:04:12.510> doesn't<00:04:12.690> be<00:04:12.870> talking<00:04:13.170> about

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
count number doesn't be talking about

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.330 
count number doesn't be talking about
and<00:04:14.640> so<00:04:15.150> we'll<00:04:15.269> take<00:04:15.420> this<00:04:15.630> output<00:04:16.290> and<00:04:16.590> wire

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
and so we'll take this output and wire

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.659 
and so we'll take this output and wire
it<00:04:17.370> into<00:04:17.760> there<00:04:18.620> so<00:04:19.620> now<00:04:19.799> a<00:04:19.830> touch<00:04:20.130> count<00:04:20.430> is

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
it into there so now a touch count is

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.210 
it into there so now a touch count is
equal<00:04:20.849> to<00:04:21.150> one<00:04:21.419> plus<00:04:21.989> the<00:04:22.349> value<00:04:22.470> that<00:04:22.800> was

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
equal to one plus the value that was

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.700 
equal to one plus the value that was
in<00:04:23.580> touch<00:04:23.790> Coon<00:04:26.150> all<00:04:27.150> right<00:04:27.360> so<00:04:27.720> now<00:04:28.350> I've<00:04:28.500> got

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
in touch Coon all right so now I've got

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.740 
in touch Coon all right so now I've got
a<00:04:28.740> value<00:04:29.190> maybe<00:04:29.700> I<00:04:29.850> want<00:04:30.090> to<00:04:30.120> compare<00:04:30.510> it<00:04:30.660> to

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
a value maybe I want to compare it to

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.350 
a value maybe I want to compare it to
something<00:04:30.990> like<00:04:31.590> maybe<00:04:33.530> when<00:04:34.530> the<00:04:35.210> value<00:04:36.210> of

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
something like maybe when the value of

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.440 
something like maybe when the value of
the<00:04:36.480> variable<00:04:36.900> gets<00:04:37.200> up<00:04:37.560> above<00:04:37.860> 10<00:04:38.370> then<00:04:39.120> I

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
the variable gets up above 10 then I

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.540 
the variable gets up above 10 then I
want<00:04:39.660> to<00:04:39.750> be<00:04:40.140> able<00:04:40.230> to<00:04:40.380> let<00:04:40.860> someplace<00:04:41.250> else<00:04:41.430> in

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
want to be able to let someplace else in

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.910 
want to be able to let someplace else in
my<00:04:41.640> program<00:04:41.970> know<00:04:42.180> about<00:04:42.450> it

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
my program know about it

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.470 
my program know about it
so<00:04:43.920> that's<00:04:44.460> where<00:04:44.610> this<00:04:44.700> comparison<00:04:45.150> block

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
so that's where this comparison block

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.610 
so that's where this comparison block
comes<00:04:45.780> in<00:04:46.520> we<00:04:47.520> have<00:04:47.610> to<00:04:47.730> compare<00:04:48.030> some<00:04:48.210> block

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
comes in we have to compare some block

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.620 
comes in we have to compare some block
and<00:04:49.620> we're<00:04:50.400> gonna<00:04:50.490> take<00:04:50.760> the<00:04:50.910> value<00:04:51.240> from<00:04:51.420> this

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
and we're gonna take the value from this

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.560 
and we're gonna take the value from this
and<00:04:51.960> wire<00:04:52.440> it<00:04:52.650> into<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:53.520> a<00:04:53.760> terminal<00:04:54.300> of<00:04:54.420> that

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
and wire it into the a terminal of that

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.330 
and wire it into the a terminal of that
comparison<00:04:56.180> so<00:04:57.180> the<00:04:57.300> comparison<00:04:57.600> can<00:04:58.080> be<00:04:58.340> you

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
comparison so the comparison can be you

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.630 
comparison so the comparison can be you
know<00:04:59.460> is<00:04:59.670> a<00:04:59.910> less<00:05:00.540> than<00:05:00.570> equal<00:05:01.280> less<00:05:02.280> than<00:05:02.460> B

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
know is a less than equal less than B

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.510 
know is a less than equal less than B
greater<00:05:03.150> than<00:05:03.180> B<00:05:03.510> or<00:05:03.780> equal<00:05:04.350> to<00:05:04.500> B<00:05:04.650> in<00:05:04.920> this

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
greater than B or equal to B in this

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.640 
greater than B or equal to B in this
case<00:05:05.670> I<00:05:06.210> probably<00:05:06.750> want<00:05:06.960> to<00:05:06.990> go<00:05:07.140> greater<00:05:07.440> than

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
case I probably want to go greater than

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.320 
case I probably want to go greater than
B<00:05:07.800> so<00:05:08.160> the<00:05:09.090> you<00:05:09.360> know<00:05:09.450> go<00:05:09.630> 0<00:05:09.960> 1<00:05:10.260> 2<00:05:10.470> 3<00:05:10.500> 4<00:05:10.770> 5<00:05:11.190> 6<00:05:11.460> 7<00:05:11.700> and

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
B so the you know go 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.159 
B so the you know go 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and
then<00:05:12.870> maybe<00:05:13.050> when<00:05:13.290> we<00:05:13.440> get<00:05:13.560> up<00:05:13.740> to<00:05:14.120> 10<00:05:15.120> we<00:05:15.960> want

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
then maybe when we get up to 10 we want

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.060 
then maybe when we get up to 10 we want
to<00:05:16.260> have<00:05:16.440> it<00:05:16.710> turn<00:05:17.700> this<00:05:17.880> terminal<00:05:18.360> into<00:05:18.780> true

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
to have it turn this terminal into true

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.280 
to have it turn this terminal into true
so<00:05:20.070> that's<00:05:20.160> what<00:05:20.400> this<00:05:20.660> block<00:05:21.660> is<00:05:21.840> all<00:05:21.990> about

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
so that's what this block is all about

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.960 
so that's what this block is all about
it's<00:05:22.680> going<00:05:22.800> to<00:05:22.860> compare<00:05:23.280> the<00:05:23.430> two<00:05:23.460> values<00:05:23.790> a

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
it's going to compare the two values a

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:29.510 
it's going to compare the two values a
and<00:05:24.240> B<00:05:24.600> and<00:05:25.320> when<00:05:25.890> a<00:05:26.190> is<00:05:26.580> greater<00:05:27.570> than<00:05:27.900> 10<00:05:28.590> then

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
and B and when a is greater than 10 then

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.280 
and B and when a is greater than 10 then
it's<00:05:29.850> going<00:05:30.030> to<00:05:30.090> set<00:05:30.330> this<00:05:30.510> terminal<00:05:30.870> equal<00:05:31.200> to

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
it's going to set this terminal equal to

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.090 
it's going to set this terminal equal to
true<00:05:32.780> so<00:05:33.780> now<00:05:33.930> we've<00:05:34.110> done<00:05:34.290> something<00:05:34.710> kind<00:05:34.980> of

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
true so now we've done something kind of

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.890 
true so now we've done something kind of
useful<00:05:35.250> well<00:05:35.880> how<00:05:36.210> would<00:05:36.270> you<00:05:36.450> use<00:05:36.660> it<00:05:37.320> well<00:05:38.900> an

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
useful well how would you use it well an

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.830 
useful well how would you use it well an
example<00:05:40.020> might<00:05:40.620> be<00:05:40.650> over<00:05:40.979> here<00:05:41.690> here's<00:05:42.690> this

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
example might be over here here's this

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.100 
example might be over here here's this
program<00:05:43.260> that<00:05:43.470> I<00:05:43.500> just<00:05:43.740> wrote<00:05:43.979> and<00:05:45.110> we're

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
program that I just wrote and we're

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.140 
program that I just wrote and we're
taking<00:05:46.470> the<00:05:46.590> output<00:05:47.040> of<00:05:47.070> this<00:05:47.310> and<00:05:47.610> feeding<00:05:48.000> it

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
taking the output of this and feeding it

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.260 
taking the output of this and feeding it
into<00:05:48.300> this<00:05:48.780> other<00:05:48.990> other<00:05:49.500> task<00:05:50.160> saying<00:05:51.090> what

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
into this other other task saying what

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.140 
into this other other task saying what
the<00:05:51.390> heck<00:05:51.690> is<00:05:51.840> going<00:05:52.110> on<00:05:52.200> here<00:05:52.760> well<00:05:53.760> we<00:05:54.000> have

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
the heck is going on here well we have

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.320 
the heck is going on here well we have
two<00:05:54.360> tasks<00:05:55.070> both<00:05:56.070> of<00:05:56.280> these<00:05:56.400> are<00:05:56.820> running<00:05:57.210> at

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
two tasks both of these are running at

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.710 
two tasks both of these are running at
the<00:05:57.360> same<00:05:57.600> time<00:05:57.900> so<00:05:58.740> we<00:05:58.860> have<00:05:58.979> two<00:05:59.160> programs

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
the same time so we have two programs

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.420 
the same time so we have two programs
this<00:06:00.720> top<00:06:00.990> one<00:06:01.169> here<00:06:01.320> is<00:06:01.410> a<00:06:01.440> wall<00:06:01.710> follower<00:06:02.220> and

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
this top one here is a wall follower and

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.820 
this top one here is a wall follower and
so<00:06:03.180> it's<00:06:03.419> going<00:06:03.570> to<00:06:03.630> follow<00:06:03.840> the<00:06:04.110> wall<00:06:04.350> and

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
so it's going to follow the wall and

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.140 
so it's going to follow the wall and
it's<00:06:05.040> going<00:06:05.130> to<00:06:05.280> do<00:06:05.700> it<00:06:05.850> until<00:06:06.890> the<00:06:08.150> value

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
it's going to do it until the value

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.000 
it's going to do it until the value
that's<00:06:09.450> connected<00:06:10.050> to<00:06:10.080> this<00:06:10.260> terminal<00:06:10.800> is

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
that's connected to this terminal is

then it tells this kind of stop so at

00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:48.179 
then it tells this kind of stop so at
that<00:06:46.149> point<00:06:46.419> I<00:06:46.809> could<00:06:47.289> do<00:06:47.439> something<00:06:47.679> else<00:06:47.979> out

00:06:48.179 --> 00:06:48.189 
that point I could do something else out

that point I could do something else out
here<00:06:48.459> if<00:06:48.610> I<00:06:48.729> wanted<00:06:48.999> to<00:06:50.129> so<00:06:51.129> there's<00:06:51.309> a<00:06:51.369> lot<00:06:51.519> of

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:51.639 
here if I wanted to so there's a lot of

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:53.939 
here if I wanted to so there's a lot of
power<00:06:51.819> to<00:06:51.969> variables<00:06:52.629> and<00:06:52.989> I<00:06:53.499> would<00:06:53.830> suggest

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:53.949 
power to variables and I would suggest

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:56.429 
power to variables and I would suggest
that<00:06:54.279> you<00:06:54.459> look<00:06:54.699> at<00:06:55.119> the<00:06:55.239> help<00:06:55.479> on<00:06:55.779> them<00:06:56.080> and

00:06:56.429 --> 00:06:56.439 
that you look at the help on them and

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:59.100 
that you look at the help on them and
you<00:06:57.099> try<00:06:57.369> experimenting<00:06:57.909> with<00:06:58.059> them<00:06:58.360> you'll

00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.110 
you try experimenting with them you'll

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:00.749 
you try experimenting with them you'll
find<00:06:59.319> that<00:06:59.529> you<00:06:59.649> can<00:06:59.830> do<00:06:59.949> some<00:07:00.159> pretty<00:07:00.489> amazing

00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:00.759 
find that you can do some pretty amazing

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:02.969 
find that you can do some pretty amazing
things
