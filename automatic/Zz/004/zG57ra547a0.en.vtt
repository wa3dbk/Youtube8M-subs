00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
ability that doesn't do anything they

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.830 
ability that doesn't do anything they
have<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.500> it's<00:01:14.280> called<00:01:14.610> what<00:01:15.360> we<00:01:15.479> call<00:01:15.659> it's

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
have the it's called what we call it's

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.280 
have the it's called what we call it's
not<00:01:15.960> quick<00:01:16.259> reload<00:01:16.890> it's<00:01:17.250> something<00:01:18.060> else

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
not quick reload it's something else

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.440 
not quick reload it's something else
it's<00:01:19.290> an<00:01:19.950> ability<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.400> doesn't<00:01:20.850> do<00:01:20.939> anything

it's an ability that doesn't do anything

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.020 
it's an ability that doesn't do anything
essentially<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.920> should<00:01:23.340> be<00:01:23.460> quick<00:01:23.700> reload

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
essentially it should be quick reload

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.590 
essentially it should be quick reload
but<00:01:24.299> it's<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:25.580> something<00:01:26.580> else<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.119> has<00:01:27.270> no

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
but it's it's something else that has no

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.300 
but it's it's something else that has no
relationship<00:01:28.200> with<00:01:28.470> anything<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.130> data

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
relationship with anything in the data

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.690 
relationship with anything in the data
files<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:30.650> they<00:01:31.650> are<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> useless<00:01:32.040> ability<00:01:32.310> it

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
files so they are a useless ability it

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.160 
files so they are a useless ability it
hasn't<00:01:33.030> been<00:01:33.090> patched<00:01:33.360> yet

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.910 

which<00:01:36.710> is<00:01:36.890> quite<00:01:37.100> funny<00:01:37.430> CIA<00:01:37.850> making<00:01:38.920> CIA

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
which is quite funny CIA making CIA

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:47.460 
which is quite funny CIA making CIA
making<00:01:40.280> them<00:01:40.570> DLC<00:01:41.590> units<00:01:42.590> from<00:01:43.190> a<00:01:43.340> DLC<00:01:43.760> faction

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.750 

they<00:01:48.470> have<00:01:48.620> abilities<00:01:49.040> that<00:01:49.220> don't<00:01:49.400> work<00:01:49.610> and

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
they have abilities that don't work and

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.730 
they have abilities that don't work and
still<00:01:50.120> don't<00:01:50.300> work<00:01:50.540> after<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.290> game<00:01:51.440> has<00:01:51.620> been

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
still don't work after the game has been

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.140 
still don't work after the game has been
out<00:01:51.860> for<00:01:52.070> this<00:01:52.160> long<00:01:54.640> so<00:01:55.640> they<00:01:55.790> are<00:01:55.820> taking

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
out for this long so they are taking

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.660 
out for this long so they are taking
fire<00:01:56.540> now<00:01:56.750> but<00:01:57.020> they<00:01:57.140> will<00:01:57.350> trade<00:01:58.190> well<00:01:58.430> with

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
fire now but they will trade well with

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.950 
fire now but they will trade well with
our<00:01:58.790> barons<00:01:59.120> Iberian<00:01:59.930> singers<00:02:01.870> so<00:02:02.870> the

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
our barons Iberian singers so the

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.260 
our barons Iberian singers so the
question<00:02:03.320> is<00:02:03.500> whether<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:04.070> pull<00:02:04.490> them<00:02:04.700> back<00:02:04.730> or

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
question is whether to pull them back or

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.480 
question is whether to pull them back or
to<00:02:05.540> push<00:02:05.870> the<00:02:06.110> parity<00:02:06.770> parks<00:02:07.070> in<00:02:07.190> front<00:02:07.370> of

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
to push the parity parks in front of

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.310 
to push the parity parks in front of
them<00:02:07.610> seems<00:02:08.179> like<00:02:08.240> is<00:02:08.479> pushing<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.899> piratey

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
them seems like is pushing the piratey

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.340 
them seems like is pushing the piratey
Pike's<00:02:09.530> in<00:02:09.649> front<00:02:10.390> now<00:02:11.390> this<00:02:11.630> will<00:02:11.840> allow<00:02:12.140> of

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
Pike's in front now this will allow of

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.780 
Pike's in front now this will allow of
course<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.980> person<00:02:13.130> players<00:02:13.400> to<00:02:13.520> get<00:02:13.610> some

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
course the person players to get some

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.790 
course the person players to get some
good<00:02:13.940> shots<00:02:14.090> off<00:02:14.330> but<00:02:14.570> no<00:02:15.140> goal<00:02:15.380> goes<00:02:15.590> that

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
good shots off but no goal goes that

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.750 
good shots off but no goal goes that

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
yeah these are Baron singers take a long

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.320 
yeah these are Baron singers take a long
time

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
time

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.850 
time
killing<00:02:20.690> units

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.130 

and<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.880> pressure<00:02:26.090> Prince<00:02:26.360> could<00:02:26.630> just<00:02:26.900> stand

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
and the pressure Prince could just stand

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.870 
and the pressure Prince could just stand
there<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:27.560> throw<00:02:27.800> all<00:02:28.100> of<00:02:28.130> his<00:02:28.340> precursors

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
there and throw all of his precursors

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.870 
there and throw all of his precursors
which<00:02:28.910> I<00:02:29.360> guess<00:02:29.540> is<00:02:29.690> what<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:29.990> wants<00:02:30.380> to<00:02:30.500> do

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
which I guess is what it wants to do

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.090 
which I guess is what it wants to do
hold<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.450> center<00:02:32.660> with<00:02:33.050> his<00:02:33.080> cheapest<00:02:33.650> sword

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
hold the center with his cheapest sword
