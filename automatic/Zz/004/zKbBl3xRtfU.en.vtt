00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
through the harp not playing a chord as

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.389 
through the harp not playing a chord as
such<00:01:53.270> but<00:01:53.509> just<00:01:53.899> breathing<00:01:54.679> out<00:01:54.890> naturally

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.850 

so<00:02:07.910> you<00:02:08.780> know<00:02:08.899> it<00:02:09.110> sounds<00:02:09.500> like<00:02:09.619> it<00:02:09.710> sounds

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
so you know it sounds like it sounds

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.470 
so you know it sounds like it sounds
fine<00:02:10.130> as<00:02:10.280> long<00:02:10.340> as<00:02:10.460> it's<00:02:10.700> natural<00:02:11.120> like<00:02:11.270> that

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
fine as long as it's natural like that

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.120 
fine as long as it's natural like that
you<00:02:11.690> can<00:02:11.930> breathe<00:02:12.350> through<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.710> heart<00:02:12.920> if

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
you can breathe through the heart if

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.280 
you can breathe through the heart if
there's<00:02:13.340> not<00:02:13.490> time<00:02:13.730> to<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.720> move<00:02:14.930> your<00:02:15.110> mouth

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
there's not time to to move your mouth

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.370 
there's not time to to move your mouth
away<00:02:18.280> but<00:02:19.280> if<00:02:19.910> there<00:02:20.450> isn't<00:02:20.630> a<00:02:20.780> blow<00:02:20.960> note<00:02:21.200> that

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
away but if there isn't a blow note that

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.880 
away but if there isn't a blow note that
you<00:02:21.470> can<00:02:21.650> use<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:22.870> think<00:02:23.870> that<00:02:24.320> the<00:02:24.470> question<00:02:24.800> I

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
you can use I think that the question I

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.320 
you can use I think that the question I
got<00:02:25.130> was<00:02:25.250> actually<00:02:25.400> in<00:02:25.610> relation<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.150> when

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
got was actually in relation to when

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:33.699 
got was actually in relation to when
your<00:02:26.510> vamping<00:02:27.410> on<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.340> draw<00:02:32.500> one<00:02:33.500> of<00:02:33.590> these

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
your vamping on the draw one of these

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:41.050 
your vamping on the draw one of these
kind<00:02:34.040> of<00:02:39.100> one<00:02:40.100> of<00:02:40.190> those<00:02:40.310> kind<00:02:40.580> of<00:02:40.640> risk<00:02:40.820> words
