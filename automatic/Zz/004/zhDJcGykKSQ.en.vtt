00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
hole up you can stop flatten it down and

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:56.300 
hole up you can stop flatten it down and
make<00:03:49.780> it<00:03:50.019> go<00:03:50.140> forward

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.559 

you<00:03:57.310> just<00:03:57.489> want<00:03:57.640> to<00:03:57.700> make<00:03:57.790> it<00:03:58.000> so<00:03:58.300> that<00:03:58.420> you're

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
was just going for the forward look like

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.350 
was just going for the forward look like
all<00:04:08.500> my<00:04:08.650> hair<00:04:08.830> up<00:04:09.010> then<00:04:09.250> forward<00:04:09.640> this<00:04:09.909> angle

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
all my hair up then forward this angle

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.720 
all my hair up then forward this angle
kind<00:04:10.540> of<00:04:10.629> thing<00:04:11.010> which<00:04:12.010> is<00:04:12.040> all<00:04:12.250> good<00:04:12.459> and<00:04:12.489> if

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730
