00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.980
 raikkonen instead what kind of problems it has 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.750
 had and according to you that margins of 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.120
 improvement saw what he has 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.820
 done on the track the margin is huge 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.950
 because this weekend has been cut 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.870
 out 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:19.320
 far behind towards di 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.750
 alonso has but for now is a pilot 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.189
 already with vernon eight breasts and if today 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.010
 on the most we see that when it puts down 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.769
 the foot and then did not buy it the remains 2 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.970
 he made a mistake he shouldn't make 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.700
 in form 1 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.770
 you were expecting so I told you before you 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.719
 we have already seen difficulties in kimi 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.180
 with the delivery of these machines in 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.770
 exit curve and it seems so that 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.120
 he is right already ie he has not improved 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.520
 so much during these two days 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.600
 let's hear from the live 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.739
 kimi raikkonen's voice 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:57.750
 what happened in this q2 i think 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:00.300
 i slipped it and then i went to 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.680
 slamming rest remained stuck in 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.080
 the traffic was weekend it is 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.810
 hard enough for us but sometimes 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.430
 so we will see also for many pilots 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.439
 tomorrow it will be a kind of battery tool 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.869
 You will be able to do better but certainly 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:21.030
 as given a delicate 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.939
 I think we have the speed but I am 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.080
 remained in the midst of traffic and we do not have 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.080
 had time to do another round 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.119
 clearly did not help me to have 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.240
 damaged the front wing is gone 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.240
 so 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:43.560
 the car 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.810
 but if count was a bit of a day 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.700
 difficult to find that one with the trim 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:54.060
 right but that's how it was today 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.970
 definitely better but the result is 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.250
 that was how much I needed to 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.260
 I try to find a feeling with his 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.390
 machine will be the same thing when it is 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.630
 arrived at the ferrari in the past has 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.700
 done mid-season whenever not 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.440
 find the way to drive the car there 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.330
 only wanted at the end of the season when it is 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.670
 went a little in a felipe crisis for him 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.920
 come back and it seems to be the same thing 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.630
 now it seems like a real marquetry difficulty 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.630
 to the machine and must react
