which makes me think more that she is a

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.750 
which makes me think more that she is a
character<00:00:51.539> with<00:00:52.350> meaning<00:00:52.920> usually<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.610> as<00:00:53.730> a

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
character with meaning usually it as a

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.869 
character with meaning usually it as a
guest<00:00:54.090> star<00:00:54.620> it<00:00:55.620> would<00:00:55.739> be<00:00:55.980> one<00:00:56.219> episode<00:00:56.670> so

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
guest star it would be one episode so

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.400 
guest star it would be one episode so

to challenged dr in very unexpected ways

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.690 
to challenged dr in very unexpected ways
now<00:02:07.000> if<00:02:07.270> we<00:02:07.480> see<00:02:07.720> in<00:02:07.780> Susan's<00:02:08.320> before<00:02:08.740> we<00:02:09.520> know

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
now if we see in Susan's before we know

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.970 
now if we see in Susan's before we know
what<00:02:09.820> to<00:02:09.940> expect<00:02:10.000> from<00:02:10.479> Susan<00:02:11.050> that<00:02:11.380> makes<00:02:11.740> me

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
what to expect from Susan that makes me

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.820 
what to expect from Susan that makes me
slightly<00:02:12.490> doubt<00:02:13.000> that<00:02:13.420> Maisie<00:02:14.170> Williams<00:02:14.350> is

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
slightly doubt that Maisie Williams is

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.480 
slightly doubt that Maisie Williams is
going<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.100> be<00:02:15.190> playing<00:02:15.540> Susan<00:02:16.540> because<00:02:17.490> we've

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
going to be playing Susan because we've

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.550 
going to be playing Susan because we've
seen<00:02:18.760> Susan<00:02:19.209> before<00:02:19.840> not<00:02:20.020> obviously<00:02:20.290> knowing

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
seen Susan before not obviously knowing

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.710 
seen Susan before not obviously knowing
the<00:02:20.680> modern<00:02:21.100> era<00:02:21.250> when<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:21.940> classic<00:02:22.510> era

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
the modern era when the classic era

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.590 
the modern era when the classic era
we've<00:02:23.020> seen<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:23.470> if<00:02:23.890> you<00:02:24.130> watch<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.520> classic<00:02:25.000> you

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
we've seen it if you watch a classic you

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.870 
we've seen it if you watch a classic you
would<00:02:25.780> know<00:02:26.020> what<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.530> expect<00:02:26.650> from<00:02:27.100> Susan<00:02:27.550> so

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
would know what to expect from Susan so

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.640 
would know what to expect from Susan so
I<00:02:27.910> don't<00:02:28.060> know<00:02:28.270> what<00:02:28.480> he<00:02:28.570> means<00:02:28.720> by<00:02:28.840> unexpected

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
I don't know what he means by unexpected

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.790 
I don't know what he means by unexpected
so<00:02:30.340> as<00:02:30.850> much<00:02:31.450> as<00:02:31.480> I<00:02:31.690> want<00:02:31.990> that<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.290> be<00:02:32.380> true<00:02:32.410> and

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
so as much as I want that to be true and

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.520 
so as much as I want that to be true and
I<00:02:32.950> hope<00:02:33.370> it's<00:02:33.670> true<00:02:33.970> it's<00:02:34.180> possible<00:02:34.840> she's

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
I hope it's true it's possible she's

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:48.860 
I hope it's true it's possible she's
young<00:02:41.670> really<00:02:44.250> tryna<00:02:45.250> do<00:02:45.459> a<00:02:45.490> video<00:02:45.760> here

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.710 

meanwhile<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:50.350> few<00:02:50.980> moments<00:02:51.400> later<00:02:51.940> I'm<00:02:52.420> not

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
meanwhile a few moments later I'm not

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.699 
meanwhile a few moments later I'm not
sure<00:02:52.989> it's<00:02:53.260> likely<00:02:53.739> i<00:02:53.890> can<00:02:54.280> hope<00:02:55.150> but<00:02:58.350> now<00:02:59.350> I

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
sure it's likely i can hope but now I

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.670 
sure it's likely i can hope but now I
think<00:03:00.190> Moffat<00:03:01.090> being<00:03:01.600> Moffat<00:03:02.140> is<00:03:02.260> going<00:03:02.620> to

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
think Moffat being Moffat is going to

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.880 
think Moffat being Moffat is going to
