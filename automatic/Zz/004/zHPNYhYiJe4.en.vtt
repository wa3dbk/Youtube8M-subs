00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.030 
but I was hoping he turned into a bay
dog<00:03:56.820> since<00:03:57.060> he<00:03:57.180> couldn't<00:03:57.390> catch<00:03:57.740> so<00:03:58.740> far<00:03:58.950> he

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
dog since he couldn't catch so far he

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.550 
dog since he couldn't catch so far he
