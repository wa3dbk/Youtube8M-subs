00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
map is again very simple all you have to

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.730 
map is again very simple all you have to
do<00:05:22.669> is<00:05:22.940> make<00:05:23.240> it<00:05:23.360> from<00:05:23.570> the<00:05:23.960> first<00:05:24.229> green<00:05:24.529> light

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
do is make it from the first green light

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.070 
do is make it from the first green light
you<00:05:24.919> see<00:05:25.070> a<00:05:25.099> Honda<00:05:25.520> left<00:05:25.729> right<00:05:25.969> there<00:05:26.210> and

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
you see a Honda left right there and

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.570 
you see a Honda left right there and
make<00:05:27.320> it<00:05:27.440> to<00:05:27.560> the<00:05:27.680> second<00:05:28.039> one<00:05:28.159> and<00:05:28.370> make<00:05:28.460> that

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
make it to the second one and make that

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.219 
make it to the second one and make that
one<00:05:28.729> green<00:05:28.969> which<00:05:29.210> is<00:05:29.300> ding<00:05:29.570> you're<00:05:29.960> at<00:05:30.110> the

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
one green which is ding you're at the

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.399 
one green which is ding you're at the
end<00:05:30.380> that's<00:05:31.099> it<00:05:31.460> that's<00:05:32.360> all<00:05:32.599> it<00:05:32.779> is<00:05:32.930> it's<00:05:33.289> a

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:33.409 
end that's it that's all it is it's a

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:35.560 
end that's it that's all it is it's a
skill<00:05:33.770> game<00:05:33.979> it's<00:05:34.279> actually<00:05:34.490> rated<00:05:34.880> at<00:05:35.120> medium

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
skill game it's actually rated at medium

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.570 
skill game it's actually rated at medium
so<00:05:35.810> I<00:05:35.870> guess<00:05:36.110> once<00:05:36.529> you<00:05:36.620> get<00:05:36.800> it<00:05:36.919> down<00:05:37.099> then<00:05:37.460> you

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
so I guess once you get it down then you

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.070 
so I guess once you get it down then you
can<00:05:37.699> just<00:05:37.820> continually<00:05:38.449> just<00:05:38.539> do<00:05:38.750> it<00:05:38.900> so<00:05:39.050> I

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
can just continually just do it so I

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.890 
can just continually just do it so I
guess<00:05:39.320> that<00:05:39.770> makes<00:05:39.919> it<00:05:40.130> medium<00:05:40.669> I<00:05:41.000> beg<00:05:41.870> to

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
guess that makes it medium I beg to

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:42.790 
guess that makes it medium I beg to
differ<00:05:42.110> however

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
differ however

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.529 
differ however
damn<00:05:43.339> it<00:05:44.110> it's<00:05:45.110> so<00:05:45.349> hard<00:05:45.620> to<00:05:45.740> watch<00:05:46.120> I<00:05:47.120> do

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 
damn it it's so hard to watch I do

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:50.320 
damn it it's so hard to watch I do
eventually<00:05:48.260> end<00:05:48.620> up<00:05:48.710> making<00:05:48.889> it<00:05:49.159> over<00:05:49.339> right<00:05:50.150> I

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
eventually end up making it over right I

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.029 
eventually end up making it over right I
tried<00:05:50.779> everything<00:05:51.139> of<00:05:51.440> course<00:05:51.469> and<00:05:51.919> then<00:05:52.010> I

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:52.039 
tried everything of course and then I

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:53.379 
tried everything of course and then I
