stabilization<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:12.270> shaky<00:02:12.540> video<00:02:12.870> is<00:02:13.200> Tara

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
stabilization so shaky video is Tara

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.860

nobody<00:02:14.010> wants<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.310> watch<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.880> iPhones<00:02:15.750> are

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
nobody wants to watch it iPhones are

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.580 
nobody wants to watch it iPhones are
small<00:02:16.230> so<00:02:17.040> think<00:02:17.550> about<00:02:17.780> stabilization

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
small so think about stabilization

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.800 
small so think about stabilization
first<00:02:20.250> things<00:02:20.459> first<00:02:20.520> go<00:02:21.150> into<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.420> filmic

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
first things first go into the filmic

first things first go into the filmic
Pro<00:02:21.989> settings<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.620> scroll<00:02:23.489> down<00:02:23.520> till<00:02:24.000> you

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
see something that says image

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.850 
see something that says image
stabilization<00:02:26.000> always<00:02:27.000> make<00:02:27.209> sure<00:02:27.390> that's<00:02:27.569> on

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
stabilization always make sure that's on

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.860 
stabilization always make sure that's on
before<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:28.920> start<00:02:29.099> shooting<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.599> is<00:02:30.840> a

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
before you start shooting so that is a

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.410 
before you start shooting so that is a
beautiful<00:02:31.349> thing<00:02:31.500> also<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.670> new<00:02:32.849> 6<00:02:33.239> and

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
beautiful thing also the new 6 and

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.089 
beautiful thing also the new 6 and
6-plus<00:02:33.690> iPhones<00:02:34.319> have<00:02:34.470> great<00:02:34.830> image

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
6-plus iPhones have great image

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.309 
6-plus iPhones have great image
stabilization<00:02:35.519> so<00:02:36.000> that<00:02:36.810> will<00:02:36.959> be<00:02:37.050> helpful

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
stabilization so that will be helpful

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.250 
stabilization so that will be helpful
but<00:02:38.160> if<00:02:38.280> you<00:02:38.310> don't<00:02:38.519> have<00:02:38.610> those<00:02:39.110> this<00:02:40.110> is

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
but if you don't have those this is

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.020 
but if you don't have those this is
called<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.590> ir<00:02:40.860> a--<00:02:41.010> fir<00:02:41.160> case<00:02:41.370> it's<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.760> media

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
called the ir a-- fir case it's a media

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.430 
called the ir a-- fir case it's a media
case<00:02:42.239> and<00:02:42.569> you<00:02:42.690> just<00:02:42.840> stick<00:02:42.989> your<00:02:43.050> iphone

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
case and you just stick your iphone

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.320 
case and you just stick your iphone
right<00:02:43.650> in<00:02:43.800> there<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.160> just<00:02:44.940> having<00:02:45.209> these

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
right in there and just having these

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.729 
right in there and just having these
hand<00:02:45.600> grips<00:02:45.840> really<00:02:46.140> helps<00:02:46.560> with

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
hand grips really helps with

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.420 
hand grips really helps with
stabilization<00:02:47.239> so<00:02:48.239> that's<00:02:48.750> an<00:02:48.930> option<00:02:49.430> this

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
stabilization so that's an option this

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.059 
stabilization so that's an option this
is<00:02:50.580> an<00:02:50.670> action<00:02:50.970> life<00:02:51.180> media<00:02:51.630> M<00:02:51.959> cam<00:02:52.500> light<00:02:52.799> case

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
is an action life media M cam light case

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.970 
is an action life media M cam light case
and<00:02:53.370> this<00:02:54.060> thing's<00:02:54.269> really<00:02:54.420> heavy<00:02:54.540> so<00:02:55.440> just

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
and this thing's really heavy so just

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.370 
and this thing's really heavy so just
the<00:02:56.100> weight<00:02:56.580> alone<00:02:56.880> helps<00:02:57.540> helps<00:02:58.170> you

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
the weight alone helps helps you

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.949 
the weight alone helps helps you
stabilize<00:02:58.950> you've<00:02:59.910> got<00:03:00.120> some<00:03:00.360> things<00:03:00.660> you<00:03:00.840> can

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
stabilize you've got some things you can

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.460 
stabilize you've got some things you can
mount<00:03:01.170> here<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:01.830> can<00:03:01.980> mount<00:03:02.160> lens<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:03.810> there's

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
mount here you can mount lens so there's

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.140 
mount here you can mount lens so there's
a<00:03:04.560> lot<00:03:04.739> of<00:03:04.860> image<00:03:05.069> stabilization<00:03:05.459> options

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
a lot of image stabilization options

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.030 
a lot of image stabilization options
that's<00:03:06.420> just<00:03:06.690> two<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:07.019> them<00:03:07.170> but<00:03:07.709> think<00:03:07.920> about

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
that's just two of them but think about

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.820 
that's just two of them but think about
stabilization<00:03:08.940> because<00:03:09.030> that's<00:03:09.269> key

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
stabilization because that's key

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.600 
stabilization because that's key
alright<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:10.920> also<00:03:11.069> want<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.340> think<00:03:11.519> about

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
alright you also want to think about

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.720 
alright you also want to think about
resolution<00:03:13.069> especially<00:03:14.069> if<00:03:14.130> you<00:03:14.190> have<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.340> 16

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730

gig<00:03:14.880> phone<00:03:15.090> you're<00:03:15.840> definitely<00:03:16.080> going<00:03:16.319> to

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
gig phone you're definitely going to

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.380 
gig phone you're definitely going to
want<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.650> go<00:03:16.950> into<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.640> filmic<00:03:17.910> Pro<00:03:18.060> settings

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
want to go into the filmic Pro settings

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.060 
want to go into the filmic Pro settings
again<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.690> you'll<00:03:19.410> see<00:03:19.620> something<00:03:19.829> that<00:03:19.950> says

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
again and you'll see something that says

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.599 
again and you'll see something that says
resolution<00:03:20.850> there's<00:03:21.329> so<00:03:21.630> many<00:03:21.750> options<00:03:22.019> but
