00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.639
 Welcome to the press conference 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.389
 after the party first fc kaiserslautern 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.760
 against the game association greuther 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.559
 of course welcome the 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.199
 opposing head coach frank kramer 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.340
 our coach kosta awesome again 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.160
 a Kramer and his commentary on 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.110
 game 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.520
 good day everybody 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.090
 I think in the first half you have 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.090
 seen that both teams me 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.890
 first wanted to sort out of the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.810
 wanted to play that out 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.200
 last risk are both team 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.200
 not gone 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.320
 so it course he then 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.890
 correspondingly few opportunities to enter 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.309
 few possibilities to the opponent goal 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.600
 yes then the can opener for 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.110
 was kaiserslautern ii they say 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.680
 then the nice shot sunday shot 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.840
 which, of course, fit in the middle 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.329
 a phase where I am relative to the throne 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.600
 little happened in the second 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.600
 half 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:10.469
 Unfortunately we'll catch a similar goal 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.179
 also nice again up there is 

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:15.329
 of course difficult to defend too 

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:18.679
 if you shoot from the distance 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:24.020
 but must take if exactly then fit 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:26.399
 G20 opponents that was given in the case 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.819
 and yes we went into the game 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.740
 then have everything together 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:34.380
 taken of course are also very high 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.329
 risk have come back and have 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.310
 then at the end just one more 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.679
 crystal clear chances to be natural 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.130
 then play in such tight then too 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:45.389
 if you have to take a profit 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.789
 wants to go home 

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:49.919
 otherwise it was very nice 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.870
 intense game that you have seen 

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:54.120
 many battles 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.530
 many close situations also in the 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.230
 midfield where every team is 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.670
 has tried such a small 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:04.400
 advantage and ultimately 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.170
 kaiserslautern has made two goals for us 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.840
 made on 1 and therefore have to with 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.180
 drive empty hands home 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.260
 nice day together the long of 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.580
 kramer costa your comment 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.300
 Congratulations to the team I think 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.530
 We have the first half 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.180
 balanced game not seen that way 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.310
 as I imagined myself 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.440
 wanted to have more pressure 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:34.110
 exercise the team and see 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:38.220
 We succeeded almost wisely 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:41.510
 not as I would have liked to see it 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.610
 Of course it can be something 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.650
 estimate long preparation first 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:51.720
 play this year important game 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:55.020
 against an opponent certainly today 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.060
 the quality had indicated and the 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.780
 defended very well close the 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:05.459
 have made space tight and there we have 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.440
 I do not think so much as I do 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.989
 that partly also in training very much and 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.430
 there was one with the 1 0 one has too 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.310
 noticed piece is very sorry 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.900
 relief was there for the team and in 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.610
 the second half I think have 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.310
 we do much more for the game 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.800
 we have already made it to the 20 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.510
 worked 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.239
 scored a second beautiful goal 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.280
 and the third gate could actually 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.940
 almost say we also told again 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.680
 such a simple strange goal 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.320
 caught and then have a bit 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.600
 nonsense that's understandable 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:43.070
 Notwithstanding the guys have everything 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.070
 given her 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:55.280
 a lot of battles have taken place 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:58.060
 in my view, the heavy preparation 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.799
 and for many hours today 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.250
 Rewards very important victory completely 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.250
 important threesome
