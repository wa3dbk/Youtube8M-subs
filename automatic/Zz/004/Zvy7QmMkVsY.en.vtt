trying<00:00:01.079> to<00:00:01.170> make<00:00:01.290> a<00:00:01.319> construction<00:00:01.920> move<00:00:02.100> let's

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
trying to make a construction move let's

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.880 
trying to make a construction move let's
talk<00:00:02.879> about<00:00:03.030> some<00:00:03.300> tips<00:00:03.330> the<00:00:04.319> kit<00:00:04.560> comes<00:00:04.799> with

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
talk about some tips the kit comes with

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.730 
talk about some tips the kit comes with
one<00:00:05.190> motor<00:00:05.400> which<00:00:06.029> spins<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.810> axle<00:00:07.259> piece<00:00:07.500> as

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
one motor which spins the axle piece as

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.220 
one motor which spins the axle piece as
you<00:00:08.010> can<00:00:08.340> see<00:00:08.519> right<00:00:08.700> here<00:00:08.870> the<00:00:09.870> easiest

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
you can see right here the easiest

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.049 
you can see right here the easiest
method<00:00:10.650> is<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:10.830> put<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.070> motor<00:00:11.250> so<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.580> axle

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
method is to put the motor so the axle

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.400 
method is to put the motor so the axle
is<00:00:12.150> already<00:00:12.540> spinning<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.019> way<00:00:13.139> that<00:00:13.320> you

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
is already spinning the way that you

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.070 
is already spinning the way that you
want<00:00:13.620> it<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.889> so<00:00:14.670> here<00:00:15.000> say<00:00:15.299> we<00:00:15.450> wanted<00:00:15.750> this

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
want it to so here say we wanted this

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.170 
want it to so here say we wanted this
piece<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.560> move<00:00:16.680> forward<00:00:17.190> we<00:00:17.730> put<00:00:17.970> on<00:00:18.090> the

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
piece to move forward we put on the

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.420 
piece to move forward we put on the
motor<00:00:18.359> horizontally<00:00:19.140> as<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:20.070> find<00:00:20.310> out

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
motor horizontally as you find out

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.250 
motor horizontally as you find out
quickly<00:00:20.670> though<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.330> only<00:00:21.480> get<00:00:21.689> rotation<00:00:22.170> on

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
quickly though you only get rotation on

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.859 
quickly though you only get rotation on
one<00:00:22.470> side<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.920> motor<00:00:23.210> we<00:00:24.210> can<00:00:24.359> use<00:00:24.510> gears

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
one side of the motor we can use gears

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.310 
one side of the motor we can use gears
to<00:00:25.050> make<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.230> second<00:00:25.680> nearby<00:00:26.220> shaft<00:00:26.519> spin<00:00:27.320> so

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
to make a second nearby shaft spin so

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.099 
to make a second nearby shaft spin so
here<00:00:28.859> we<00:00:28.980> have<00:00:29.070> this<00:00:29.220> set<00:00:29.460> up<00:00:29.609> which<00:00:30.510> we<00:00:30.750> slide

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
here we have this set up which we slide

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.850 
here we have this set up which we slide
this<00:00:31.380> motor<00:00:31.650> piece<00:00:31.890> into<00:00:33.290> and<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.559> can<00:00:34.710> see

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
this motor piece into and you can see

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.130 
this motor piece into and you can see
that<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.130> gear<00:00:35.399> from<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.700> motor<00:00:35.969> drives<00:00:36.840> this

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
that the gear from the motor drives this

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.470 
that the gear from the motor drives this
gear<00:00:37.469> which<00:00:37.920> then<00:00:38.160> drives<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.700> axle<00:00:39.239> and

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
gear which then drives this axle and

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.950 
gear which then drives this axle and
wheels<00:00:39.540> on<00:00:40.050> either<00:00:40.230> side<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:41.010> body<00:00:41.780> so<00:00:42.780> now

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
wheels on either side of the body so now

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.690 
wheels on either side of the body so now
you<00:00:43.020> can<00:00:43.320> attach<00:00:43.410> many<00:00:43.829> more<00:00:44.100> things<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
you can attach many more things to the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.090 
you can attach many more things to the
back<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.059> piece<00:00:45.239> like<00:00:45.480> wheels<00:00:45.750> or<00:00:46.200> feet<00:00:46.950> or

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
back so piece like wheels or feet or

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.090 
back so piece like wheels or feet or
anything<00:00:47.219> else<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.700> can<00:00:47.879> come<00:00:48.000> up<00:00:48.149> with<00:00:49.100> but

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
anything else you can come up with but

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.979 
anything else you can come up with but
does<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.610> actual<00:00:50.910> spinning<00:00:51.180> too<00:00:51.329> fast

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
does the actual spinning too fast

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.869 
does the actual spinning too fast
first<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.949> can<00:00:53.070> try<00:00:53.250> turning<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.730> power

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
first you can try turning the power

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.900 
first you can try turning the power
motor<00:00:54.390> down<00:00:54.690> on<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.289> computer<00:00:55.910> sometimes

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
motor down on the computer sometimes

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.459 
motor down on the computer sometimes
turning<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.480> powered<00:00:57.780> down<00:00:57.899> won't<00:00:58.170> slow<00:00:58.410> it

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
turning the powered down won't slow it

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.529 
turning the powered down won't slow it
enough<00:00:58.770> or<00:00:59.129> makes<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.609> motor<00:00:59.789> too<00:01:00.059> weak<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.420> do

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
enough or makes the motor too weak to do

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.959 
enough or makes the motor too weak to do
what<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.780> want<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.340> case<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.820> can

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
what you want it to in this case you can

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.820 
what you want it to in this case you can
gear<00:01:03.180> down<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.600> motor<00:01:03.809> as<00:01:04.049> explained<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.710> my

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
gear down the motor as explained the my

gear down the motor as explained the my
gears<00:01:05.070> snippet<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:06.240> will<00:01:06.450> slow<00:01:06.659> down<00:01:06.689> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
gears snippet this will slow down the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.920 
gears snippet this will slow down the
rotation<00:01:07.170> speed<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.070> make<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.369> more<00:01:08.520> powerful

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
rotation speed and make it more powerful

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.060 
rotation speed and make it more powerful
the<00:01:09.930> opposite<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.500> also<00:01:10.619> true

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
the opposite is also true

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.670 
the opposite is also true
axial<00:01:11.820> spinning<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.180> too<00:01:12.330> slow<00:01:12.680> axial

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
axial spinning is too slow axial

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.920 
axial spinning is too slow axial

spinning too slowly turning up the power
not<00:01:16.110> working<00:01:16.439> enough<00:01:16.530> you're<00:01:17.430> up<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> motor

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
not working enough you're up the motor

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.640 
not working enough you're up the motor
it<00:01:18.270> will<00:01:18.390> reduce<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.840> power<00:01:19.020> but<00:01:19.320> increase

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
it will reduce the power but increase

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.969 
it will reduce the power but increase
the<00:01:19.770> rotational<00:01:20.280> speed<00:01:20.750> for<00:01:21.750> example<00:01:22.259> if<00:01:22.860> you

direction we want the axle to spin like
we<00:01:41.070> have<00:01:41.189> here<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:42.420> can<00:01:42.479> use<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.810> crown<00:01:43.049> gear

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
we have here you can use the crown gear

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:51.020 
we have here you can use the crown gear
and<00:01:45.979> have<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:48.090> motor<00:01:48.299> mounted<00:01:48.979> directly<00:01:50.030> so

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
and have the motor mounted directly so

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.520 
and have the motor mounted directly so
we<00:01:51.180> have<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.420> change<00:01:51.659> axles<00:01:52.170> here<00:01:54.500> use<00:01:55.500> a

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
we have to change axles here use a

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.499 
we have to change axles here use a
smaller<00:01:55.950> gear<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:56.969> case<00:01:57.240> we're<00:01:57.420> going

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
smaller gear so in this case we're going

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.950 
smaller gear so in this case we're going
to<00:01:57.570> be<00:01:57.630> gearing<00:01:57.960> down<00:02:01.969> so<00:02:02.969> using<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.509> crown<00:02:03.719> gear

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
to be gearing down so using a crown gear

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.289 
to be gearing down so using a crown gear
you<00:02:04.170> can<00:02:04.200> make<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.130> axle<00:02:05.399> spin<00:02:05.670> at<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.909> 90

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
you can make the axle spin at a 90

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.820 
you can make the axle spin at a 90
degree<00:02:06.570> angle<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.170> motor<00:02:09.319> so<00:02:10.319> let's<00:02:10.679> talk

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
degree angle to the motor so let's talk

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.080 
degree angle to the motor so let's talk
about<00:02:10.890> some<00:02:11.220> basic<00:02:11.610> ways<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.790> make<00:02:12.060> a

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
about some basic ways to make a

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.460 
about some basic ways to make a
construction<00:02:12.720> move

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
construction move

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.730 
construction move
first<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.550> easiest<00:02:14.880> is<00:02:15.120> with<00:02:15.240> wheels<00:02:15.840> every

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
first the easiest is with wheels every

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.710 
first the easiest is with wheels every
kit<00:02:16.980> will<00:02:17.310> come<00:02:17.340> with<00:02:17.580> two<00:02:17.910> of<00:02:18.060> them<00:02:20.600> you<00:02:21.600> have

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
kit will come with two of them you have

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.210 
kit will come with two of them you have
to<00:02:21.840> get<00:02:21.960> creative<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.440> get<00:02:22.530> most<00:02:22.830> of<00:02:23.040> them

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
to get creative to get most of them

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.890 
to get creative to get most of them
though<00:02:23.430> because<00:02:23.460> there's<00:02:23.970> only<00:02:24.120> two<00:02:24.240> so<00:02:24.840> you

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
though because there's only two so you

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.420 
though because there's only two so you
might<00:02:25.140> have<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.410> use<00:02:25.560> something<00:02:25.980> else<00:02:26.070> to<00:02:26.310> make

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
might have to use something else to make

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.490 
might have to use something else to make
the<00:02:26.670> make<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.390> structure<00:02:27.720> glide<00:02:28.050> although<00:02:28.380> in

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
the make the structure glide although in

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.070 
the make the structure glide although in
the<00:02:28.590> front<00:02:28.850> like<00:02:29.850> maybe<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.210> smooth<00:02:30.510> piece<00:02:30.810> or

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
the front like maybe a smooth piece or

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.450 
the front like maybe a smooth piece or
just<00:02:31.290> have<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.440> drag<00:02:34.010> if<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.160> want<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.370> make

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
just have a drag if you want to make

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.890 
just have a drag if you want to make
something<00:02:35.670> more<00:02:35.910> adventurous<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:36.630> can

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
something more adventurous you can

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.020 
something more adventurous you can
always<00:02:37.020> build<00:02:37.290> some<00:02:37.500> teeth<00:02:37.770> as<00:02:38.010> we've<00:02:38.820> done

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
always build some teeth as we've done

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.800 
always build some teeth as we've done
here<00:02:40.040> so<00:02:41.040> we<00:02:41.370> have<00:02:41.580> what<00:02:41.880> I<00:02:42.060> like<00:02:42.240> to<00:02:42.510> call<00:02:42.570> the

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
here so we have what I like to call the

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.810 
here so we have what I like to call the
leg<00:02:42.990> piece<00:02:43.290> right<00:02:43.710> here<00:02:43.770> which<00:02:44.340> will<00:02:44.520> connect

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
leg piece right here which will connect

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.940 
leg piece right here which will connect
directly<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.450> axle<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.380> that<00:02:46.620> piece<00:02:46.920> is

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
directly to the axle and that piece is

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.490 
directly to the axle and that piece is
fixed<00:02:47.459> in<00:02:47.580> this<00:02:47.700> will<00:02:47.910> rotate<00:02:48.060> here<00:02:48.600> and<00:02:48.780> then

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
fixed in this will rotate here and then

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.140 
fixed in this will rotate here and then
we've<00:02:49.620> loosely<00:02:50.040> attached<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.520> foot<00:02:50.790> here

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
we've loosely attached the foot here

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.690 
we've loosely attached the foot here
with<00:02:51.930> an<00:02:52.080> axle<00:02:52.500> that<00:02:52.770> goes<00:02:52.950> through<00:02:53.250> this<00:02:53.400> red

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
with an axle that goes through this red

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.130 
with an axle that goes through this red
piece<00:02:53.910> that<00:02:54.180> has<00:02:54.300> a<00:02:54.330> straight<00:02:54.660> hole<00:02:54.840> through

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
piece that has a straight hole through

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.449 
piece that has a straight hole through
it<00:02:55.310> so<00:02:56.310> when<00:02:56.400> we<00:02:56.520> attach<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:58.080> leg<00:02:58.320> to<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:58.950> axle

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
it so when we attach the leg to the axle

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.230 
it so when we attach the leg to the axle
as<00:02:59.720> we've<00:03:00.720> already<00:03:00.870> done<00:03:01.110> on<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.260> other<00:03:01.440> side

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
as we've already done on the other side

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.060 
as we've already done on the other side
then<00:03:03.240> we<00:03:03.420> get<00:03:03.570> this<00:03:03.690> nice<00:03:03.900> set<00:03:04.200> of<00:03:04.440> two<00:03:04.860> feet<00:03:07.070> so

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
then we get this nice set of two feet so

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.640 
then we get this nice set of two feet so
when<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.610> axle<00:03:09.030> axle<00:03:09.570> spins<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:10.080> legs<00:03:10.290> due<00:03:10.470> to

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
when the axle axle spins the legs due to

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.030 
when the axle axle spins the legs due to
which<00:03:11.130> then<00:03:11.400> moves<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.760> feet<00:03:12.060> in<00:03:12.270> turn<00:03:13.040> you

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
which then moves the feet in turn you

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.530 
which then moves the feet in turn you
can<00:03:14.160> put<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.400> legs<00:03:14.580> at<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.730> same<00:03:14.820> angle<00:03:15.390> so

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
can put the legs at the same angle so

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.120 
can put the legs at the same angle so
the<00:03:15.630> feet<00:03:15.810> move<00:03:15.959> together<00:03:16.140> or<00:03:16.709> at<00:03:16.830> different

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
the feet move together or at different

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.759 
the feet move together or at different
angles<00:03:17.220> so<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:17.670> feet<00:03:17.880> can<00:03:18.000> walk<00:03:18.470> so<00:03:19.470> let's<00:03:19.590> try

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
angles so the feet can walk so let's try

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.120 
angles so the feet can walk so let's try
that<00:03:19.800> out<00:03:19.980> see<00:03:20.340> what<00:03:20.459> it<00:03:20.519> looks<00:03:20.670> like

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:32.870 

look<00:03:26.130> at<00:03:26.220> that<00:03:26.310> little<00:03:26.459> guy<00:03:26.930> crawling<00:03:27.930> away<00:03:31.880> so

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
look at that little guy crawling away so

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.759 
look at that little guy crawling away so
explore<00:03:33.660> if<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.870> we<00:03:33.959> do<00:03:34.110> kit<00:03:34.350> and<00:03:34.500> come<00:03:34.650> up

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
explore if the we do kit and come up

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.850 
explore if the we do kit and come up
with<00:03:34.860> some<00:03:35.010> cool<00:03:35.160> movement<00:03:35.550> of<00:03:35.640> your<00:03:35.760> own
