00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:06.549
 hello I am 9104 states of stress have me 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.469
 recommended the game I have been told it is 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:09.670
 really handsome I'm playing with a 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:13.299
 Laptop is holding up pretty 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:17.529
 I will show you this game and I will not 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:19.630
 I know and comparing it with the 2 they say that 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.880
 this is crap because the houses are 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.710
 easy to burn and the prefectures are 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.130
 difficult to build and we'll see 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.109
 I have come to have cities of 4000 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.509
 people in the empire in civitas 2 already 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.550
 I will teach the gravel of God but I have 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.379
 wanted to try this because I had it 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.449
 saved I had not tried it is original 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.629
 from what I bought I bought the edition 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:42.340
 special platinum of I do not know what it was 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.859
 a box with all the empires and views 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.379
 they had taken out and even what online 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:49.640
 but what online 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.470
 I do not know is very 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.809
 and it's crap come on you have to play 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.640
 much to be someone good we're going to 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.040
 start to know what good 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.680
 and styles more cities of Rome in all 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.820
 the campaigns and everything that is styled 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.390
 more to my mind it 's Roma campaigns already 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.030
 I told you I 'm not very good 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.159
 I reached the 4,000 inhabitants inhabitants 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.560
 in the empire in dating I still do not know how 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.560
 but well let's see load heading 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.320
 and good graphics are great as 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.380
 always all the orientals have had 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.630
 beautiful graphics and it 's the only thing 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.119
 that has good empire enimita is a 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.759
 of the things that are bestial in this 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.549
 game are these gorgeous graphics that 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.459
 they are super playable 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.860
 that is to say it is really impressive to me 

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:49.659
 has surprised that we can recruit 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.929
 small legions 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.030
 with the main buildings that is 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.159
 if there is a rebellion or something we are in the 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.959
 I've been recommended by Cabrera Island 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.340
 because they told me it's really 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:02.520
 Awesome 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.520
 a fire come fuck 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.340
 this leaves the play on the ground 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.830
 gameplay this game what this does 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.800
 of the fires is to leave the gameplay 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.500
 on the floor of this game is not not 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.970
 too exaggerated the point is not to 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.190
 can throw to the ground in a way that 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.700
 we'll have to wait for it to go 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.160
 good man this area as you know 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.000
 that I have thrown many buildings because 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.030
 it has no outlet this area so go 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.420
 to 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:39.380
 Well, this little town that I've 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.060
 started today no no no I do not take much 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.010
 good time 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.160
 here was a sawmill the first one 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.230
 did but has stayed here I am negative 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.900
 minus 5 because I do not have to take morbid not 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.670
 it does not matter I do not worry as you already know 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.390
 this game the graphics really 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:00.500
 bestial 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:04.250
 they are spectacular in my opinion this is 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.860
 bestial and this one that does not matter 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.500
 this type seems important in the 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.540
 papers there there is none the same is that 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.220

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.390
 bestial this game I love I love it 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.819

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.550

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:22.180
 we're 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.540
 this amazing look goes away and we're going to 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.520
 follow him 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.900
 the drum good because this game is very 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.580
 playable and I have said it is really 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.520
 awesome the mill 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:37.450
 they have added everything for what it does 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:40.540
 military to me the barracks of the main 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.160
 it's a castle is bestial I love to 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.900
 platforms this thing that is bestial 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.700
 I could make platforms before I had 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.590
 a mountain could not build now 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.300
 you can not make a platform that 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.910
 do you have a castle what is good 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.360
 this beast of this I love adds have 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:58.150
 added all kinds of shipyards lad 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.980
 shipyards have added ports have 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.380
 added trading posts is very 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.380
 well it's a game really crazed the 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.540
 best main buildings the 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.140
 food what the food is good 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.140
 bestial barn option that a handsome man does not 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.140
 good 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.130
 this building will not start clear these 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.250
 programs that is too much 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.930
 difficult this game is to say those who already 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.930
 with handsome market 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.670
 is that I do not like that if it's very 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.600
 currado very currado the first fund is 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:37.380
 This is 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.960
 and well the forum I've done here and I'll do 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.030
 left space around to make a 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.640
 good villa we'll see what I do here today 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.600
 they have finished the temple the celebration 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.600
 of the banquet 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:54.990
 the banquet 8 forward 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.570
 I do not know who are celebrating or gave anything 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:01.970
 same is fine this I really like this 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:05.310
 game I'm falling in love and good to these 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.800
 a little more good friend to throw and for 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.010
 what does what is good is that 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.670
 now the aqueducts you have to 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.260
 start 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.920
 that is when you find a source 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.150
 as you see here, you put it then 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.730
 previously there was already the tower and that's what 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.010
 did a little bit of real and trade is very 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.930
 complicated with other cities being a 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.940
 island that I am on the island of Cabrera since 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.080
 I 've told you, it 's very complicated 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.870
 trade from here 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.939
 This is what the PNC has given a lot 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.740
 fertile ways uncle fuck this yes that's 

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:37.599
 one shit is left here only three 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.419
 parcels here there are many and only 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:43.599
 I can explode that piece of here is this 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:45.689
 yes that is very very very complicated but 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:45.689
 good 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:52.340
 You see the farm must locate a land 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:55.400
 fertile vale you see everything is busy this 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.940
 it sucks is this yes that is what 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.460
 is handsome 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.890
 let's try this for example by 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.870
 example you see when it gets yellow is 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.670
 that we can put buildings together 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.620
 he is beautiful because the empire in 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.650
 civitas 2 alexandria which is the city 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:13.800
 most used in quotes 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:16.919
 it was crap has occupied much later 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.930
 the good teaches I will not extend more 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.550
 then an introductory video so that 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.919
 see how is the game here I am 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:26.789
 playing now and well I tell you what they do 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:32.570
 I understand that it is not really very 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:32.570
 Currado and good see you bye
