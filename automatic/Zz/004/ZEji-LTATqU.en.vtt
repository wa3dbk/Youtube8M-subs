00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
standard as the blueprint and then

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.350 
standard as the blueprint and then
you'll<00:01:56.770> have<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:57.070> Builder<00:01:57.430> or<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:58.120> breeder

healthier<00:04:45.890> dogs<00:04:46.280> and<00:04:46.490> they<00:04:46.550> ever<00:04:46.700> happen

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
healthier dogs and they ever happen

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.730 
healthier dogs and they ever happen
because<00:04:47.690> they're<00:04:48.020> listening<00:04:48.500> in<00:04:48.620> the

because they're listening in the

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
they're better than that great that's

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.420 
they're better than that great that's
the<00:04:56.960> challenge<00:04:57.350> we<00:04:57.470> face<00:04:57.500> in<00:04:57.830> America<00:04:57.890> how<00:04:58.400> can

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
the challenge we face in America how can

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.340 
the challenge we face in America how can
we<00:04:58.700> get<00:04:58.940> two<00:04:59.120> more<00:04:59.150> of<00:04:59.360> these<00:04:59.540> breeders<00:04:59.930> how

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
we get two more of these breeders how

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.290 
we get two more of these breeders how
can<00:05:00.530> we<00:05:00.620> educate<00:05:00.770> them<00:05:01.220> how<00:05:01.430> can<00:05:01.490> we<00:05:01.730> eliminate

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
can we educate them how can we eliminate

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.210 
can we educate them how can we eliminate
the<00:05:02.450> bad<00:05:02.630> breeders<00:05:03.050> that's<00:05:03.530> the<00:05:03.710> focus<00:05:04.070> and

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
the bad breeders that's the focus and

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:11.170 
the bad breeders that's the focus and
that's<00:05:04.310> what<00:05:04.520> we<00:05:04.610> want<00:05:04.820> to<00:05:04.880> do

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.790 

I<00:05:11.330> think<00:05:11.720> one<00:05:11.960> thing<00:05:12.139> that<00:05:12.289> we<00:05:12.380> have<00:05:12.500> to<00:05:12.650> keep

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
I think one thing that we have to keep

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.670 
I think one thing that we have to keep
in<00:05:12.979> mind<00:05:13.220> is<00:05:13.520> that<00:05:13.729> there's<00:05:14.180> a<00:05:14.680> tremendous

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
in mind is that there's a tremendous

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.370 
in mind is that there's a tremendous
number<00:05:15.860> I<00:05:16.150> mentioned<00:05:17.150> previously<00:05:17.300> over<00:05:18.020> 100

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
number I mentioned previously over 100

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.710 
number I mentioned previously over 100
genetic<00:05:18.770> tests<00:05:19.190> and<00:05:19.370> a<00:05:19.789> wide<00:05:20.030> variety<00:05:20.690> of

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
genetic tests and a wide variety of

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.140 
genetic tests and a wide variety of
other<00:05:20.960> pre<00:05:21.259> breeding<00:05:21.620> health<00:05:21.800> screening<00:05:22.280> that

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
other pre breeding health screening that

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.360 
other pre breeding health screening that
can<00:05:23.300> be<00:05:23.389> performed<00:05:24.020> and<00:05:24.229> I<00:05:24.590> think<00:05:24.830> as<00:05:25.039> we<00:05:25.220> get

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
can be performed and I think as we get

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.490 
can be performed and I think as we get
into<00:05:25.550> some<00:05:25.850> of<00:05:25.970> the<00:05:26.060> complexities<00:05:26.810> of<00:05:26.840> this

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
into some of the complexities of this

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.529 
into some of the complexities of this
and<00:05:27.770> the<00:05:27.889> complexities<00:05:28.550> of<00:05:28.580> genetics<00:05:29.180> it

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:29.539 
and the complexities of genetics it

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:31.300 
and the complexities of genetics it
makes<00:05:29.960> it<00:05:30.110> much<00:05:30.259> more<00:05:30.530> important<00:05:31.070> for

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
makes it much more important for

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.279 
makes it much more important for
breeders<00:05:31.699> to<00:05:31.729> be<00:05:32.090> discussing<00:05:32.900> those<00:05:33.229> things

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.289 
breeders to be discussing those things

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:35.529 
breeders to be discussing those things
with<00:05:33.740> their<00:05:33.949> veterinarian<00:05:34.610> not<00:05:35.150> every<00:05:35.360> dog

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:35.539 
with their veterinarian not every dog

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:37.540 
with their veterinarian not every dog
that<00:05:35.750> enters<00:05:36.050> the<00:05:36.169> ring<00:05:36.320> ends<00:05:36.710> up<00:05:36.800> in<00:05:36.979> entering

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
that enters the ring ends up in entering

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.460 
that enters the ring ends up in entering
into<00:05:37.669> a<00:05:37.850> breeding<00:05:38.090> program<00:05:38.389> I<00:05:38.900> think<00:05:39.350> it

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
into a breeding program I think it

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.590 
into a breeding program I think it
really<00:05:39.770> needs<00:05:39.889> to<00:05:40.190> be<00:05:40.280> a<00:05:40.669> communal<00:05:41.389> effort

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
really needs to be a communal effort

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.749

chances of producing healthy dogs

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.820 
chances of producing healthy dogs
because<00:05:50.780> we<00:05:50.900> want<00:05:51.080> to<00:05:51.139> focus<00:05:51.320> our<00:05:51.560> time<00:05:51.620> and

the show ring predominantly are healthy

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.260 
the show ring predominantly are healthy
because<00:05:58.400> if<00:05:58.490> you<00:05:58.580> follow<00:05:58.759> that<00:05:59.000> breed

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
because if you follow that breed

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.120 
because if you follow that breed
standard<00:05:59.720> that<00:06:00.169> gives<00:06:00.470> you<00:06:00.590> the<00:06:00.680> guide<00:06:00.860> of

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
what a dog should be like in both

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.839 
what a dog should be like in both
structure<00:06:03.380> temperament<00:06:04.190> and<00:06:04.340> how<00:06:04.520> the<00:06:04.580> dog

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849 
structure temperament and how the dog

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:05.980 
structure temperament and how the dog
should<00:06:05.030> move<00:06:05.270> and<00:06:05.419> it<00:06:05.509> should<00:06:05.630> all<00:06:05.750> flow

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
should move and it should all flow

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.050 
should move and it should all flow
together<00:06:06.110> so<00:06:06.830> those<00:06:06.979> dogs<00:06:07.220> are<00:06:07.400> healthy<00:06:07.820> we

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
together so those dogs are healthy we

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.700 
together so those dogs are healthy we
would<00:06:08.210> rather<00:06:08.389> focus<00:06:08.720> on<00:06:09.080> making<00:06:09.410> sure<00:06:09.470> all

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
would rather focus on making sure all

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:10.629 
would rather focus on making sure all

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 
dogs are healthy

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:13.990 
dogs are healthy
let's<00:06:10.880> have<00:06:11.060> how<00:06:11.180> let's<00:06:11.449> work<00:06:11.690> on<00:06:11.930> on<00:06:13.000> working

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
let's have how let's work on on working

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:28.059 

we<00:06:24.770> don't<00:06:25.009> see<00:06:25.249> that<00:06:25.780> in<00:06:26.780> line<00:06:27.110> breeding<00:06:27.650> as

00:06:28.059 --> 00:06:28.069 
we don't see that in line breeding as

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:31.050 
we don't see that in line breeding as
you<00:06:28.340> recall<00:06:28.699> it<00:06:28.939> is<00:06:29.719> going<00:06:30.050> to<00:06:30.229> necessarily

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
you recall it is going to necessarily

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.260 
you recall it is going to necessarily
produce<00:06:32.060> disease<00:06:32.979> in<00:06:33.979> some<00:06:34.219> cases<00:06:34.460> you<00:06:34.789> can<00:06:34.819> in

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
produce disease in some cases you can in

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.179 
produce disease in some cases you can in
some<00:06:35.449> cases<00:06:35.659> you<00:06:35.930> can't<00:06:36.169> it<00:06:36.409> really<00:06:36.650> depends

00:06:37.179 --> 00:06:37.189 
some cases you can't it really depends

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:39.939 
some cases you can't it really depends
on<00:06:37.310> how<00:06:38.180> the<00:06:38.240> genetics<00:06:39.110> are<00:06:39.259> working<00:06:39.680> through

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:39.949 
on how the genetics are working through

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:41.019 
on how the genetics are working through
and<00:06:40.189> that's<00:06:40.370> where<00:06:40.550> it's<00:06:40.669> very<00:06:40.849> very

00:06:41.019 --> 00:06:41.029 
and that's where it's very very

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:43.719 
and that's where it's very very
important<00:06:41.749> for<00:06:42.379> breeders<00:06:42.830> to<00:06:43.129> understand

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:43.729 
important for breeders to understand

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:45.999 
important for breeders to understand
that<00:06:44.300> they<00:06:44.479> need<00:06:44.509> to<00:06:44.779> work<00:06:44.990> with<00:06:45.289> a<00:06:45.499> veterinary

00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:46.009 
that they need to work with a veterinary

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:48.309 
that they need to work with a veterinary
genetic<00:06:46.400> counselor<00:06:46.939> to<00:06:47.509> help<00:06:47.539> them<00:06:47.960> with<00:06:48.169> some

00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 
genetic counselor to help them with some

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:49.809 
genetic counselor to help them with some
of<00:06:48.439> those<00:06:48.529> decisions<00:06:48.889> so<00:06:49.249> that<00:06:49.370> we<00:06:49.490> can<00:06:49.669> reduce

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:49.819 
of those decisions so that we can reduce

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:57.010 
of those decisions so that we can reduce
disease
