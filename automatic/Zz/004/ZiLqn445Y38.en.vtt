00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.610 
see if it will it will disappear you see
and<00:06:17.879> I<00:06:18.879> don't<00:06:19.000> know<00:06:19.360> maybe<00:06:19.629> it's<00:06:19.870> the<00:06:19.900> light<00:06:20.199> -

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
and I don't know maybe it's the light -

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.450 
and I don't know maybe it's the light -
the<00:06:21.129> light<00:06:21.250> is<00:06:21.669> very<00:06:22.500> yellow<00:06:23.500> and<00:06:23.710> that<00:06:24.129> makes

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
the light is very yellow and that makes

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:30.360 
the light is very yellow and that makes
the<00:06:24.729> water<00:06:25.419> look<00:06:25.750> yellow<00:06:27.389> so<00:06:28.529> but<00:06:29.529> he's<00:06:29.919> happy

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
the water look yellow so but he's happy

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.300 
the water look yellow so but he's happy
anyway<00:06:30.789> I<00:06:31.090> think<00:06:31.659> paid<00:06:32.289> officials<00:06:32.860> I've<00:06:33.069> heard

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
anyway I think paid officials I've heard

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.649 
anyway I think paid officials I've heard
at<00:06:33.460> benefit<00:06:33.849> she's<00:06:34.029> really<00:06:34.479> like<00:06:35.009> black<00:06:36.009> water

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:36.659 
at benefit she's really like black water

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:38.910 
at benefit she's really like black water
so<00:06:37.659> I<00:06:38.139> guess<00:06:38.440> he's

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:38.920 
so I guess he's

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.760 
so I guess he's
be<00:06:39.160> at<00:06:39.310> least<00:06:39.520> but<00:06:40.030> I<00:06:40.300> would<00:06:40.630> be<00:06:40.750> happier<00:06:41.200> if<00:06:41.440> I

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:41.770 
be at least but I would be happier if I

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:47.060 
be at least but I would be happier if I
actually<00:06:42.520> can<00:06:42.910> see<00:06:43.090> him<00:06:43.300> an<00:06:43.420> attack<00:06:44.160> so<00:06:45.480> yeah

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.070 
actually can see him an attack so yeah
