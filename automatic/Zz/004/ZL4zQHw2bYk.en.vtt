00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.220 
the computer is not on just on enough to
where<00:02:09.129> I<00:02:09.160> can<00:02:09.369> get<00:02:09.459> bus<00:02:09.670> power<00:02:10.019> okay<00:02:11.019> so<00:02:11.080> I'm

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
where I can get bus power okay so I'm

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.440 
where I can get bus power okay so I'm
using<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.620> USB<00:02:11.860> bus<00:02:12.220> power<00:02:12.459> but<00:02:13.269> it's

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
using the USB bus power but it's

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.820 
using the USB bus power but it's
completely<00:02:13.569> off<00:02:14.140> right<00:02:14.440> now

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
completely off right now

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.000 
completely off right now
so<00:02:15.220> I'm<00:02:15.310> not<00:02:15.430> running<00:02:15.700> any<00:02:15.849> programs<00:02:17.010> through

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
so I'm not running any programs through

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.589 
so I'm not running any programs through
the<00:02:18.040> computer<00:02:18.489> I'm<00:02:18.580> just<00:02:18.760> using<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.090> power<00:02:19.300> at

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
the computer I'm just using the power at

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.770 
the computer I'm just using the power at
this<00:02:19.750> time<00:02:19.989> but<00:02:20.680> you<00:02:20.980> can<00:02:21.160> hook<00:02:21.340> up<00:02:21.520> a<00:02:21.700> 12<00:02:22.600> volt

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
this time but you can hook up a 12 volt

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.180 
this time but you can hook up a 12 volt
adapter<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:23.380> this<00:02:23.560> so<00:02:23.710> you<00:02:23.770> don't<00:02:23.920> need<00:02:24.100> to

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
adapter to this so you don't need to

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.190 
adapter to this so you don't need to
actually<00:02:24.340> bring<00:02:24.580> your<00:02:24.700> USB

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
actually bring your USB

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.710 
actually bring your USB
our<00:02:26.260> or<00:02:27.069> you<00:02:27.160> could<00:02:27.310> probably<00:02:27.459> use<00:02:27.730> like<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.000> an

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
our or you could probably use like a an

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.170 
our or you could probably use like a an
iPod<00:02:29.200> adapter<00:02:29.400> power<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.790> just<00:02:30.910> plug<00:02:31.060> this

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
iPod adapter power and just plug this

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.720 
iPod adapter power and just plug this
USB<00:02:31.480> right<00:02:31.810> into<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.410> USB<00:02:33.069> adapter<00:02:33.519> and

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
USB right into the the USB adapter and

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.420 
USB right into the the USB adapter and
that<00:02:34.690> way<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:34.870> have<00:02:34.959> power<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:35.470> your<00:02:35.590> unit<00:02:35.650> so
