 associations and thus many technical 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.599
 innovate 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.629
 except that for the first time the 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.970
 term 16 bit graphic field features the 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:36.299
 play about novel sprite scaling

 arcade operators are however 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.940
