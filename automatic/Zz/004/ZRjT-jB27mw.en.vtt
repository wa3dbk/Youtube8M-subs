00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.920
 and ended the first day of the euro 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:13.930
 and good for me 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.790
 the net is that it was great because 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.029
 because all the matches there were goals 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:22.060
 because there were at least 30 minutes where the 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.670
 first leg and we turn the ball 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.210
 very much rhythm of truth this is good 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.670
 football and not mx but it does not matter 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.210
 Well the truth is that there were many 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.760
 surprises 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.370
 for example Denmark that hit him 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.460
 holland that very strange thing because 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.340
 holland as always had the ball a 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.559
 very good game the crisis awaited her and 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.920
 speak be the ball but 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:51.579
 they really did not get it they did not define and by 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.989
 that denmark hit them 10 good you 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.539
 you know because I already knew I 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.210
 commented that for me the team of 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:01.120
 this euro is called German was not it 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.610
 they saw how very good against Portugal in 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.770
 as to why they did not explode because 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.970
 obviously it's the first day and all 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.450
 the teams then be on the lookout 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.010
 that they're going to be their rivals how it's going 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.230
 to be 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.390
 in the stadium of the states of knowing 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.060
 the courts but I think that the 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.210
 second day that is, it's late, there's 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.780
 I go another good game the game for me the 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.140
 true that he was the one who broke all kinds 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.270
 of expectations was Spain against Italy 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.850
 italy that little things dads saw 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.160
 that I deserve that gross is for the 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.460
 only ones that can put a little bit of 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.460
 hey there's hey here you have 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.250
 competition to the Spaniards the truth is 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:49.660
 which I also think is very opinion 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:53.560
 truth the lord of the forest the net that 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:55.979
 Torres put the brave child what 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.320
 things do not get them or by mistake 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.930
 really that in what way to fail 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.070
 one saying champion of the 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:09.210
 champions the chelsea still really 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:12.760
 many may well have put I do not know yet 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:15.130
 nailed dude llorente I think of by 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.360
 example as well as say the poor 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.310
 man does not have a bank or does not have 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.180
 players and he's looking hard 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.520
 well, not Portugal, on the other hand 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.430
 it makes me that disappointment as always 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.850
 that is a gray team having very 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:34.480
 good individualities and me the canvas 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:37.930
 it made me like super dirty pp 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.090
 everything was good until a punch 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.970
 they gave a boys of German age 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.650
 good from germany and the net does not 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.680
 loved that team 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.830
 another great big big surprise obviously 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.530
 it was ukraine punch I have to gross that 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.690
 veteran 35 years as prescribed by me 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.290
 doctor regrets that it is very well 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:03.100
 goals very well and well that's that to me 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:06.040
 I like I do not know because it's pretty 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:10.180
 nice and on the other hand this one never 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:13.510
 I'm just ibrahÃ­movic way that I gross a 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.780
 disgusting individualist we know that no 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.480
 you have like the team 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.430
 But for God, value your 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.310
 mates or I do it because it stings you 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:26.030
 I said let there what counts is , 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.920
 really very bad russia another surprise 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.860
 a pleasant surprise because commonly 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.900
 in this type of matches and especially in 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:37.250
 the first days is not like it 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.560
 go to the front and then later but russia 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.500
 The truth is that very well 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.319
 41 that was cool to me I liked it 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.510
 very much croatia then again giving 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:50.930
 surprises like that many years ago 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.959
 he did nobody thought to do anything in 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.000
 the world and soups and the net is that 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.370
 in this euro you see that it brings what 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.040
 Well obviously he got to contract 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.860
 holland that is the team a little more 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.950
 weak of group c but 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:10.790
 there is a good grace, do not miss it 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:14.180
 the clue to these children well I think that 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:17.660
 It is a journey that really helped us 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:20.540
 very much to see each one of those of the 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.250
 parties how teams 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.200
 find the individualities of each 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.510
 one the thinking of the technical directors 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:30.200
 and we hope that the second day we 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.420
 bring many more surprises more good 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.250
 football because they will surely make a 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.070
 little more explosives are going to risk more 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.140
 they will go for everything and as I mentioned to 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.150
 principle the most important thing is that in 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:44.180
 all the matches there were goals so 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.220
 This is the best football in the world and me 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.340
 I love 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.340
 do not
