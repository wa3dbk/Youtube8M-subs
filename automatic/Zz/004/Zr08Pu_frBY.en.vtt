some<00:01:35.110> echinacea<00:01:35.920> love<00:01:36.910> echinacea<00:01:37.330> I<00:01:37.510> just

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
some echinacea love echinacea I just

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.330 
some echinacea love echinacea I just
think<00:01:37.870> it's<00:01:37.990> so<00:01:38.200> beautiful<00:01:38.710> in<00:01:38.920> my<00:01:39.070> garden

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
think it's so beautiful in my garden

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.790 
think it's so beautiful in my garden
well<00:01:40.030> we<00:01:40.300> have<00:01:40.480> a<00:01:40.510> seedling<00:01:41.170> dome<00:01:41.500> and

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
well we have a seedling dome and

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.620 
well we have a seedling dome and
seedling<00:01:42.370> kit<00:01:42.640> allows<00:01:43.060> for<00:01:43.360> some<00:01:43.450> air

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
seedling kit allows for some air

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.030 
seedling kit allows for some air
circulation<00:01:44.110> because<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.560> plants<00:01:44.860> will<00:01:44.920> be

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
circulation because the plants will be

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.740 
circulation because the plants will be
producing<00:01:45.460> oxygen<00:01:45.640> but<00:01:46.150> they<00:01:46.270> need<00:01:46.480> to<00:01:46.600> get

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
producing oxygen but they need to get

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.840 
producing oxygen but they need to get
that<00:01:46.900> carbon<00:01:47.320> dioxide<00:01:47.770> that<00:01:47.950> co2<00:01:48.280> back<00:01:48.670> in

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
that carbon dioxide that co2 back in

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.070 
that carbon dioxide that co2 back in
there<00:01:49.060> we're<00:01:49.270> just<00:01:49.330> gonna<00:01:49.480> fill<00:01:49.720> these<00:01:49.840> cells

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
there we're just gonna fill these cells

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.740 
there we're just gonna fill these cells
up<00:01:50.230> with<00:01:50.350> some<00:01:50.470> soil<00:01:50.760> grab<00:01:51.760> some<00:01:51.940> big<00:01:52.120> handfuls

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
up with some soil grab some big handfuls

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.780 
up with some soil grab some big handfuls
and<00:01:53.110> I<00:01:53.380> like<00:01:53.830> to<00:01:53.920> put<00:01:54.130> it<00:01:54.220> right<00:01:54.340> in<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:54.550> middle

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
and I like to put it right in the middle

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.970 
and I like to put it right in the middle
so<00:01:55.630> then<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:55.870> can<00:01:55.990> push<00:01:56.260> it<00:01:56.440> out<00:01:56.560> to<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.860> edges

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
so then you can push it out to the edges

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.950 
so then you can push it out to the edges
just<00:01:57.340> spreading<00:01:57.730> it<00:01:57.880> across<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.180> top<00:01:58.570> helps

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
just spreading it across the top helps

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.190 
just spreading it across the top helps
it<00:01:59.080> fit<00:01:59.260> evenly<00:02:00.090> distributed<00:02:01.090> we're<00:02:02.020> going<00:02:02.140> to

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
it fit evenly distributed we're going to

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.170 
it fit evenly distributed we're going to
go<00:02:02.320> ahead<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:02.680> water<00:02:02.920> and<00:02:03.190> we<00:02:03.940> have<00:02:04.060> our

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
go ahead and water and we have our

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.910 
go ahead and water and we have our
watering<00:02:04.450> can<00:02:04.780> hear<00:02:05.080> i'm<00:02:05.230> going<00:02:05.380> to<00:02:05.470> my<00:02:05.590> finger

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
watering can hear i'm going to my finger

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.140 
watering can hear i'm going to my finger
over<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.190> spigot<00:02:06.550> i'm<00:02:06.700> just<00:02:06.790> going<00:02:06.970> to<00:02:07.000> get<00:02:07.090> a

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
over the spigot i'm just going to get a

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.869 
over the spigot i'm just going to get a
little<00:02:07.420> stream<00:02:07.900> of<00:02:08.019> water<00:02:08.200> out<00:02:08.530> here<00:02:08.860> to<00:02:09.759> go<00:02:09.849> a

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
little stream of water out here to go a

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.729 
little stream of water out here to go a
lot<00:02:10.060> of<00:02:10.090> these<00:02:10.239> cells<00:02:10.539> with<00:02:10.810> so<00:02:11.440> I'm<00:02:11.560> not

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
lot of these cells with so I'm not

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.160 
lot of these cells with so I'm not
dumping<00:02:12.040> a<00:02:12.250> whole<00:02:12.519> volume<00:02:13.360> of<00:02:13.629> water<00:02:13.810> because

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
dumping a whole volume of water because

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.580 
dumping a whole volume of water because
that<00:02:14.319> would<00:02:14.530> wash<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:15.040> cells<00:02:15.250> out<00:02:16.260> lipid<00:02:17.260> yep

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
that would wash the cells out lipid yep

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.339 
that would wash the cells out lipid yep
drippage<00:02:18.280> is<00:02:18.430> coming<00:02:18.790> through<00:02:19.110> we're<00:02:20.110> good

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
drippage is coming through we're good

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.860 
drippage is coming through we're good
what<00:02:21.160> is<00:02:21.310> basically<00:02:21.819> the<00:02:21.970> rule<00:02:22.150> of<00:02:22.330> thumb<00:02:22.569> when

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
what is basically the rule of thumb when

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.589 
what is basically the rule of thumb when
we're<00:02:23.830> planting<00:02:24.040> seeds<00:02:24.489> three<00:02:25.030> times<00:02:25.330> the

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
we're planting seeds three times the

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:26.800 
we're planting seeds three times the
size<00:02:25.810> of<00:02:26.019> the<00:02:26.109> seed

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
size of the seed

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.660 
size of the seed
how<00:02:26.959> deep<00:02:27.170> you<00:02:27.319> want<00:02:27.380> to<00:02:27.560> go<00:02:27.680> there's<00:02:28.400> three

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
how deep you want to go there's three

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.880 
how deep you want to go there's three
seeds<00:02:28.970> right<00:02:29.150> next<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.480> each<00:02:29.599> other<00:02:29.780> so<00:02:30.770> that's

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
seeds right next to each other so that's

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.070 
seeds right next to each other so that's
how<00:02:31.099> deep<00:02:31.310> you<00:02:31.459> want<00:02:31.520> to<00:02:31.760> go<00:02:31.880> with<00:02:32.720> these<00:02:32.900> guys

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
how deep you want to go with these guys

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.290 
how deep you want to go with these guys
that's<00:02:33.650> maybe<00:02:33.860> like<00:02:34.069> not<00:02:34.489> even<00:02:34.670> a<00:02:34.880> centimeter

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
that's maybe like not even a centimeter

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.390 
that's maybe like not even a centimeter
not<00:02:35.810> even<00:02:36.050> a<00:02:36.110> cent<00:02:36.290> Amir<00:02:36.560> I<00:02:36.860> think<00:02:37.130> that<00:02:37.250> is<00:02:37.370> a

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
not even a cent Amir I think that is a

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.690 
not even a cent Amir I think that is a
great<00:02:37.700> way<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:38.959> remember<00:02:39.140> how<00:02:39.950> deeply<00:02:40.370> you

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
great way to remember how deeply you

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.990 
great way to remember how deeply you
want<00:02:41.270> to<00:02:41.599> plant<00:02:41.989> seeds<00:02:42.580> so<00:02:43.580> we're<00:02:43.700> going<00:02:43.910> in

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
want to plant seeds so we're going in

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.440 
want to plant seeds so we're going in
about<00:02:44.209> a<00:02:44.239> centimeter<00:02:45.940> we're<00:02:46.940> just<00:02:47.120> making<00:02:47.239> a

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
about a centimeter we're just making a

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.150 
about a centimeter we're just making a
little<00:02:47.569> hole<00:02:47.870> right<00:02:48.080> in<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.739> middle<00:02:48.890> of<00:02:49.040> the

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
little hole right in the middle of the

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.830 
little hole right in the middle of the
cell<00:02:49.400> just<00:02:49.819> a<00:02:49.940> tiny<00:02:50.120> little<00:02:50.269> hole<00:02:50.390> doesn't

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
cell just a tiny little hole doesn't

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.190 
cell just a tiny little hole doesn't
have<00:02:51.019> to<00:02:51.110> be<00:02:51.170> perfect<00:02:52.540> how<00:02:53.540> many<00:02:53.720> we<00:02:53.840> gonna<00:02:53.989> put

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
have to be perfect how many we gonna put

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
have to be perfect how many we gonna put
in<00:02:54.290> each<00:02:54.380> cell<00:02:54.590> Patti<00:02:55.390> maybe<00:02:56.390> 22<00:02:56.900> I<00:02:57.440> like<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.130> do

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
in each cell Patti maybe 22 I like to do

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.990 
in each cell Patti maybe 22 I like to do
too<00:02:58.370> because<00:02:58.489> that<00:02:58.670> way<00:02:58.760> you're<00:02:58.880> almost

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
too because that way you're almost

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.720 
too because that way you're almost
guaranteed<00:02:59.299> cuz<00:02:59.870> seeds<00:03:00.140> we<00:03:01.069> like<00:03:01.280> to<00:03:01.519> hope

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
guaranteed cuz seeds we like to hope

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.940 
guaranteed cuz seeds we like to hope
that<00:03:01.760> one<00:03:02.720> hundred<00:03:02.989> percent<00:03:03.019> germinate<00:03:03.739> but

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
that one hundred percent germinate but

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.680 
that one hundred percent germinate but
that's<00:03:04.100> just<00:03:04.280> facts<00:03:04.819> of<00:03:05.000> life<00:03:05.180> with<00:03:05.420> seeds

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
that's just facts of life with seeds

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.509 
that's just facts of life with seeds
sometimes<00:03:06.230> people<00:03:06.410> are<00:03:06.620> happy<00:03:06.920> with<00:03:07.100> you<00:03:07.430> know

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
sometimes people are happy with you know

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.550 
sometimes people are happy with you know
over<00:03:07.880> fifty<00:03:08.180> percent<00:03:08.450> germination<00:03:08.900> for<00:03:09.440> an

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
over fifty percent germination for an

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.620 
over fifty percent germination for an
heirloom<00:03:09.890> seed<00:03:10.190> so<00:03:10.730> the<00:03:10.760> next<00:03:11.060> step<00:03:11.269> is<00:03:11.569> to

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
heirloom seed so the next step is to

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.610 
heirloom seed so the next step is to
just<00:03:12.500> cover<00:03:12.940> lightly<00:03:13.940> cover<00:03:14.239> the<00:03:15.019> seeds<00:03:15.290> you

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
just cover lightly cover the seeds you

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.680 
just cover lightly cover the seeds you
can<00:03:16.069> use<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.400> same<00:03:16.610> stick<00:03:16.880> use<00:03:17.090> you<00:03:17.420> can<00:03:17.540> just

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
can use the same stick use you can just

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.240 
can use the same stick use you can just
do<00:03:18.200> some<00:03:18.380> work<00:03:18.530> at<00:03:18.709> your<00:03:18.830> fingers<00:03:19.130> little

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
do some work at your fingers little

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.729 
do some work at your fingers little
dirty<00:03:19.549> and<00:03:19.760> just<00:03:19.910> push<00:03:20.720> that<00:03:20.930> soil<00:03:21.260> a<00:03:21.500> little

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
dirty and just push that soil a little

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.640 
dirty and just push that soil a little
bit<00:03:21.950> around<00:03:22.640> to<00:03:22.849> fill<00:03:23.060> that<00:03:23.180> hole<00:03:23.420> back<00:03:23.630> in<00:03:23.900> and

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
bit around to fill that hole back in and

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:25.720 
bit around to fill that hole back in and
again<00:03:24.950> you're<00:03:25.069> not<00:03:25.190> adding<00:03:25.370> a<00:03:25.519> lot<00:03:25.580> of

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
again you're not adding a lot of

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.100 
again you're not adding a lot of
pressure<00:03:25.940> anything<00:03:26.420> you're<00:03:26.569> just<00:03:26.599> moving<00:03:26.900> the

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
pressure anything you're just moving the

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.789 
pressure anything you're just moving the
soil<00:03:27.319> around<00:03:27.440> a<00:03:27.680> little<00:03:27.799> bit<00:03:28.269> to<00:03:29.269> make<00:03:29.390> good

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
soil around a little bit to make good

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.849 
soil around a little bit to make good
seed<00:03:30.799> and<00:03:31.040> soil<00:03:31.400> contact<00:03:32.150> now<00:03:32.840> is<00:03:33.019> the<00:03:33.230> last

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
seed and soil contact now is the last

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:35.949 
seed and soil contact now is the last
watering<00:03:34.670> end<00:03:34.850> stage<00:03:35.120> you<00:03:35.510> can<00:03:35.660> do<00:03:35.750> it<00:03:35.840> with<00:03:35.930> a

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
watering end stage you can do it with a

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.960 
watering end stage you can do it with a
mr.<00:03:36.290> but<00:03:36.500> because<00:03:36.890> i<00:03:37.010> have<00:03:37.190> my<00:03:37.340> finger<00:03:37.790> over

this<00:03:38.209> spigot<00:03:38.750> year<00:03:39.109> we're<00:03:39.320> going<00:03:39.410> to<00:03:39.500> be<00:03:39.590> able

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
this spigot year we're going to be able

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.220 
this spigot year we're going to be able
to<00:03:39.829> get<00:03:39.950> just<00:03:40.370> enough<00:03:40.780> moisture<00:03:41.780> in<00:03:42.049> these

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
to get just enough moisture in these

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.599 
to get just enough moisture in these
little<00:03:42.380> cells<00:03:43.180> so<00:03:44.180> we're<00:03:44.359> not<00:03:44.600> completely

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
little cells so we're not completely

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.340 
little cells so we're not completely
saturating<00:03:46.720> now<00:03:47.720> we're<00:03:47.930> going<00:03:48.049> to<00:03:48.109> let<00:03:48.200> this

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
saturating now we're going to let this

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.150 
saturating now we're going to let this
sit<00:03:48.590> in<00:03:48.799> a<00:03:48.890> warm<00:03:49.870> bright<00:03:50.870> spot<00:03:51.319> we're<00:03:52.010> not

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
sit in a warm bright spot we're not

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.500 
sit in a warm bright spot we're not
going<00:03:52.280> to<00:03:52.340> put<00:03:52.459> it<00:03:52.549> in<00:03:52.640> direct<00:03:52.880> sunlight<00:03:53.090> and

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
going to put it in direct sunlight and

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.479 
going to put it in direct sunlight and
these<00:03:54.170> little<00:03:54.380> effing<00:03:54.590> agencies<00:03:55.010> should<00:03:55.040> be

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
these little effing agencies should be

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.970 
these little effing agencies should be
up<00:03:55.700> in<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.209> next<00:03:56.269> couple<00:03:56.900> weeks<00:03:57.139> I<00:03:57.500> think<00:03:57.859> it's

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
up in the next couple weeks I think it's

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.300 
up in the next couple weeks I think it's
definitely<00:03:58.130> best<00:03:58.819> to<00:03:59.329> limit<00:03:59.959> the<00:04:00.470> different

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
definitely best to limit the different

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.849 
definitely best to limit the different
varieties<00:04:01.819> of<00:04:01.850> seeds<00:04:02.209> that<00:04:02.420> you<00:04:02.480> start<00:04:02.840> in<00:04:03.109> one

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
varieties of seeds that you start in one

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:08.140 
varieties of seeds that you start in one
tray<00:04:05.079> 2122<00:04:06.430> unless<00:04:07.430> you<00:04:07.609> know<00:04:07.819> that<00:04:08.000> they're

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
tray 2122 unless you know that they're

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.090 
tray 2122 unless you know that they're
going<00:04:08.239> to<00:04:08.329> grow<00:04:08.870> roughly<00:04:09.470> at<00:04:09.590> the<00:04:09.620> same<00:04:09.709> height

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
going to grow roughly at the same height

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.559 
going to grow roughly at the same height
so<00:04:10.310> you<00:04:10.370> could<00:04:10.670> have<00:04:10.819> different<00:04:11.209> varieties<00:04:11.540> of

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
so you could have different varieties of

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.440 
so you could have different varieties of
eggplant<00:04:12.109> for<00:04:12.380> example<00:04:12.859> we<00:04:13.250> can<00:04:13.400> also<00:04:13.609> use

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
eggplant for example we can also use

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.659 
eggplant for example we can also use
these<00:04:14.720> things<00:04:15.019> yeah<00:04:15.440> we<00:04:15.590> have<00:04:15.709> some<00:04:15.739> little

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
these things yeah we have some little

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.550 
these things yeah we have some little
pots<00:04:17.030> here<00:04:17.299> and<00:04:17.479> you<00:04:17.660> know<00:04:17.690> this<00:04:18.049> these<00:04:18.380> are

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
pots here and you know this these are

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.870 
pots here and you know this these are
great<00:04:18.859> for<00:04:19.220> what<00:04:19.489> you<00:04:19.579> were<00:04:19.669> just<00:04:19.700> talking

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
I'll water these in go ahead and get

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:48.969 
I'll water these in go ahead and get
started<00:04:47.990> on<00:04:48.229> that<00:04:48.380> while<00:04:48.590> you're<00:04:48.680> breaking

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
started on that while you're breaking

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.760 
started on that while you're breaking
out<00:04:49.040> seeds<00:04:49.430> for<00:04:50.180> the<00:04:50.210> cilantro<00:04:50.630> we<00:04:51.020> can<00:04:51.260> plant

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
out seeds for the cilantro we can plant

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.909 
out seeds for the cilantro we can plant
a<00:04:51.949> lot<00:04:52.190> of<00:04:52.520> seeds<00:04:52.970> in<00:04:53.630> each<00:04:54.020> one<00:04:54.260> right<00:04:54.530> sure

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
a lot of seeds in each one right sure

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.560 
a lot of seeds in each one right sure
because<00:04:55.280> it<00:04:55.400> can<00:04:55.520> be<00:04:55.550> teased<00:04:55.910> apart<00:04:56.090> and

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
because it can be teased apart and

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.800 
because it can be teased apart and
planted<00:04:57.380> individually<00:04:58.419> how<00:04:59.419> are<00:04:59.570> you<00:04:59.630> doing

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
planted individually how are you doing

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.530 
planted individually how are you doing
make<00:05:00.470> little<00:05:00.740> lines<00:05:01.010> but<00:05:01.910> you<00:05:02.030> want<00:05:02.180> these<00:05:02.360> to

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
make little lines but you want these to

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.240 
make little lines but you want these to
probably<00:05:02.990> be<00:05:03.199> in<00:05:03.470> the<00:05:03.590> neighborhood<00:05:03.740> a

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
probably be in the neighborhood a

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.600 
probably be in the neighborhood a
quarter<00:05:04.669> inch<00:05:05.030> apart<00:05:05.919> because<00:05:06.919> again<00:05:07.280> you<00:05:07.460> can

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
quarter inch apart because again you can

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.310 
quarter inch apart because again you can
always<00:05:07.669> tease<00:05:08.120> out<00:05:08.330> the<00:05:08.450> little<00:05:08.690> plants<00:05:09.139> and

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
always tease out the little plants and

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.930 
always tease out the little plants and
replant<00:05:09.979> them<00:05:10.130> somewhere<00:05:12.669> seedlings<00:05:13.669> just

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
replant them somewhere seedlings just

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.650 
replant them somewhere seedlings just

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
look at that these are biodegradable

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.879 
look at that these are biodegradable
pots<00:05:22.490> that<00:05:22.700> are<00:05:22.820> made<00:05:23.090> out<00:05:23.330> of<00:05:23.630> rice<00:05:24.560> hulls

pots that are made out of rice hulls

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:26.940 
pots that are made out of rice hulls
that<00:05:25.400> are<00:05:25.669> gonna<00:05:25.850> last<00:05:26.120> us<00:05:26.300> a<00:05:26.330> couple<00:05:26.570> of<00:05:26.780> years

that are gonna last us a couple of years
I'm<00:05:27.950> definitely<00:05:28.400> getting<00:05:28.729> into<00:05:29.180> the<00:05:29.479> watering

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
I'm definitely getting into the watering

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.770 
I'm definitely getting into the watering
first<00:05:31.090> method<00:05:32.090> and<00:05:32.360> you<00:05:32.449> want<00:05:32.600> to<00:05:32.660> make<00:05:32.750> sure

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
first method and you want to make sure

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.870 
first method and you want to make sure
when<00:05:33.169> you<00:05:33.260> do<00:05:33.650> the<00:05:33.830> watering<00:05:34.190> first<00:05:34.430> to<00:05:34.610> move

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
when you do the watering first to move

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.029 
when you do the watering first to move
that<00:05:35.150> little<00:05:35.419> trickle<00:05:35.630> of<00:05:35.810> water<00:05:35.840> around<00:05:36.200> so

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
that little trickle of water around so

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:38.680 
that little trickle of water around so
it<00:05:37.160> evenly<00:05:37.550> waters<00:05:37.970> the<00:05:38.120> whole<00:05:38.270> thing<00:05:38.510> you're

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
it evenly waters the whole thing you're

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.270 
it evenly waters the whole thing you're
not<00:05:38.750> watering<00:05:39.139> in<00:05:39.289> one<00:05:39.410> spot<00:05:39.650> it's<00:05:40.100> a<00:05:40.130> nice

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
not watering in one spot it's a nice
