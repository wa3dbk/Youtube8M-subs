that team better think what's been tough
in<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:27.780> some<00:04:28.020> ways<00:04:28.229> that<00:04:28.350> we<00:04:28.530> didn't<00:04:28.710> have<00:04:28.800> any

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
in the some ways that we didn't have any

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.820 
in the some ways that we didn't have any
scouting<00:04:29.430> at<00:04:29.520> all<00:04:30.050> someone<00:04:31.050> who<00:04:31.199> could<00:04:31.410> go<00:04:31.560> for

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
scouting at all someone who could go for

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.189 
scouting at all someone who could go for
whatever<00:04:32.039> we<00:04:32.580> knew<00:04:32.699> we<00:04:32.850> wanted<00:04:33.000> to<00:04:33.270> go<00:04:33.539> the

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
whatever we knew we wanted to go the

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.650 
whatever we knew we wanted to go the
idea<00:04:34.500> was<00:04:34.770> just<00:04:34.919> to<00:04:35.070> do<00:04:35.250> to<00:04:35.970> bring<00:04:36.150> players<00:04:36.449> in

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
idea was just to do to bring players in

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.870 
idea was just to do to bring players in
the<00:04:36.750> summer<00:04:36.990> and<00:04:37.320> then<00:04:37.590> to<00:04:38.039> do<00:04:38.520> more<00:04:38.729> in

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
the summer and then to do more in

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.439 
the summer and then to do more in
January<00:04:39.620> we<00:04:40.620> tried<00:04:40.919> to<00:04:41.100> send<00:04:41.460> very<00:04:42.210> big

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
January we tried to send very big

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.840 
January we tried to send very big
players<00:04:42.720> in<00:04:42.870> January<00:04:43.289> but<00:04:43.949> we<00:04:44.280> won't<00:04:44.490> go<00:04:44.699> and

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
players in January but we won't go and

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.490 
players in January but we won't go and
really<00:04:45.030> successful<00:04:45.300> I<00:04:45.870> thought<00:04:46.289> we<00:04:46.440> should

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
really successful I thought we should

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.529 
really successful I thought we should
have<00:04:46.620> done<00:04:46.889> it<00:04:47.009> a<00:04:47.160> bit<00:04:47.430> more<00:04:47.610> anyways<00:04:48.030> but<00:04:48.360> we

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
have done it a bit more anyways but we

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:51.260 
have done it a bit more anyways but we
did<00:04:48.690> the<00:04:49.590> most<00:04:49.800> important<00:04:50.370> thing<00:04:50.699> for<00:04:50.940> me<00:04:51.000> is

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
did the most important thing for me is

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.939 
did the most important thing for me is
to<00:04:51.479> look<00:04:51.599> after<00:04:51.780> this<00:04:52.050> Football<00:04:52.410> Club<00:04:52.440> and

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
to look after this Football Club and

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.360 
to look after this Football Club and
that's<00:04:53.669> that's<00:04:54.000> the<00:04:54.150> critical<00:04:54.479> part<00:04:54.840> of<00:04:54.990> it

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
that's that's the critical part of it

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.920 
that's that's the critical part of it
you've<00:04:56.370> probably<00:04:56.699> seen<00:04:57.090> the<00:04:57.300> financials<00:04:57.870> for
