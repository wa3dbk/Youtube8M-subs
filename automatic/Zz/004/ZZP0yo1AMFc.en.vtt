seven reasons why this video editing
program<00:00:11.340> is<00:00:11.550> awesome<00:00:12.240> but<00:00:12.960> as<00:00:13.200> any<00:00:13.500> other

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
program is awesome but as any other

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.160 
program is awesome but as any other
program<00:00:14.190> this<00:00:14.580> one<00:00:14.820> too<00:00:15.030> has<00:00:15.420> its<00:00:15.660> downsides

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
program this one too has its downsides

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.010 
program this one too has its downsides
so<00:00:16.920> without<00:00:17.190> too<00:00:17.460> much<00:00:17.670> small<00:00:18.000> talk<00:00:18.029> we<00:00:18.840> will

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020
