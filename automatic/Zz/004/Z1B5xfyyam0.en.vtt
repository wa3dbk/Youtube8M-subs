00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:02.740
 Input and output devices 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.920
 these devices allow the user of the computer to enter data commands 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.029
 and promotions are approved 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:13.369
 the input device or more common this is a keyboard similar to that of the 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:14.649
 typewriters 

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:18.560
 information and introduced with it are formed by the computer of a 

00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:20.679
 model recognize 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:22.619
 other input devices 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.910
 only the optical fish that transmits graphic information from the tablets 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.890
 electronic devices to the computer 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.859
 yustis and the mouse 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.510
 which converts to physical movement the movement within the screen of the 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.690
 computer 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.630
 the light scanners 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.250
 the disgusting disgusting symbol of a printed page the hostos in the 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.020
 electronic confederations 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.690
 but the winner was manipulating and storage and the modules of 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.330
 recognition 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.520
 that convert the spoken word into compressible digital signals for the 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.640
 coordinator 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.080
 It is also possible to use storage devices for 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.540
 enter data to the process unit 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.160
 Other input devices used in the industry are the sensors 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.260
 input devices 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.740
 external storage devices 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.780
 can be physically received from the processing unit mainly from 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.140
 computer 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.540
 they are outside the main circuit board 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.020
 these devices store the data in the form of a race on a medium 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.960
 magnetically sensitive 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.430
 for example a sound tape 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.270
 what is more common 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.620
 only one disc coated with an end has escaped the metal particles 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.900
 The most frequent external storage devices are the 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.160
 discrete and hard drives 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.050
 although most of the large computer systems used banks 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.150
 of magnetic tape storage units 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.610
 the floppy disks 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.310
 can contain according to the system from several hundreds of thousands of 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.090
 bathers 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.350
 up to well over a million data ballet 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.600
 Hard drives can not be removed from receptacles 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.980
 of the disk drive 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.420
 that contain the positive electronic days to read and write data 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.670
 on the magnetic surface of the disks and can store and the various 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.309
 baez millions 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:12.829
 some hundreds of millions 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:15.069
 cibao technology 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.579
 that employs the same techniques to be used to make discs 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.639
 compact if I would hate 

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:24.609
 allows inability to give more lamented the order of several hundred 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:26.829
 minors 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:30.549
 you also have to add the recently appeared divided 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.629
 that allow you to store more than four league country information 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:37.299
 output device 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.069
 these devices allow the user to see the results of calculations 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.349
 may manipulations of computer data 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.799
 the most common output device in the display unit consisting of 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.329
 in a monitor that by presenting the characters and graficÃ³ of a screen 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.489
 similar to the TV 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.689
 usually the monitors have a cathode ray tube 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.709
 like that of any television, even among small computers and 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.009
 portable using screen where liquid crystal the sd 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:09.889
 acronym for lippi crystal display 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.789
 electroluminescent 

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:15.709
 Another most common output device are the printers that allow you to obtain 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.389
 a printed copy of the information received by the opposing opposition 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:21.959
 sound cards and mod
