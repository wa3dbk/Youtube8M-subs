00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.080
 When I did always stay now I would say 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.270
 than the healthier version and the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.779
 Parents should teach children how to 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.470
 well but the wheelchair is turning 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.710
 expression of a 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.700
 reaction can be very healthy has been 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.930
 contained 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.399
 not we like for example getting to the door 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.980
 from home and see the whole car crushed 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.899
 risky because the work is still 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.329
 banned to this day has left 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.100
 It is natural normal and healthy that we have 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.960
 a time when we feel 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.140
 deeply irritated 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.420
 and I have wronged 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.129
 I think this is a person's right. 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.870
 now past this moment that is 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.500
 legitimate and that it will have to be a 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.320
 intimate is incredible and lonely is that 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.640
 at which point the context for placing the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.610
 crushed engine 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.610
 if someone is going to say calm talk 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.810
 it has stuck in over the past never in 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:19.080
 three hypotheses or mine is aggressiveness 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.070
 increases in levels of violence and I am not 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.890
 Watching revenge but hit the car 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.659
 started to walk the trash can scratch 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.430
 the other cars in the background mean no 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.259
 it's just me 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.320
 the others will all stop because of 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.350
 what is bad and violence is not in the 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.229
 our can never justify is is the 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.570
 second reaction may be victimization 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:48.540
 so it's only mine as it happens 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:51.240
 with shit right it apart from justice and 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.759
 spend all her day on facebook and 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.890
 add to friends anyway have already caused 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.810
 can not hear the story in the car and 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.210
 continue in this in addition to her 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.270
 massacre at all and ineffective to seek 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.899
 continue to be threatened is the then 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.729
 this moment is to think the organ is still going 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.090
 keep the family in the car even though 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.489
 no one cold will still be insecure 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.459
 even though it was only a car and it was not mine. 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.440
 house is thankfully there are taxis and transport 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.080
 public the car can not walk 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.470
 I know my brother is a workshop to 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.379
 This is not to mention trying to 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.349
 bcd ee plan and high demand provokes 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:33.739
 wind to be able to fill a case 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.840
 this shit this feeling of injustice 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.519
 and I think it 's a trip made 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.560
 therefore when there is a war 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.720
 parents should try to understand the 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.250
 reasons of mine and try to understand 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.950
 as the child do not have a knowledge 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.860
 systemic 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.510
 the company is much more focused on 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.599
 things you want 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.760
 naki'o on those objects that rest all 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.340
 the rest would draw attention to a 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.549
 second phase for this but I will leave one 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.860
 member sun after trying to support is but 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:08.660
 always avoid and the red line that 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.660
 violence is passing away
