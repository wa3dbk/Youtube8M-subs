00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
then it is separated and discharged to

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.800 
then it is separated and discharged to
the<00:02:40.230> ultraviolet<00:02:41.230> disinfection<00:02:42.600> system<00:02:43.600> from

water<00:02:46.890> we<00:02:47.890> have<00:02:48.010> our<00:02:48.160> meeting<00:02:48.460> and<00:02:48.760> then<00:02:48.940> we<00:02:49.060> go

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
water we have our meeting and then we go

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.030 
water we have our meeting and then we go
out<00:02:49.330> into<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.720> plant<00:02:49.930> and<00:02:50.140> we<00:02:50.230> do<00:02:50.380> around<00:02:50.530> so

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
out into the plant and we do around so

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.010 
out into the plant and we do around so
we're<00:02:51.160> checking<00:02:51.520> equipment<00:02:52.180> checking<00:02:52.660> levels

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
we're checking equipment checking levels

we're checking equipment checking levels
checking<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.040> computer<00:02:54.520> and<00:02:54.790> that<00:02:55.330> usually

checking the computer and that usually

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.480 
checking the computer and that usually
takes<00:02:55.870> a<00:02:56.050> couple<00:02:56.080> hours<00:02:56.470> an<00:02:57.040> hour<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.370> half

the day a lot of times its kind of

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.840 
the day a lot of times its kind of
troubleshooting<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:08.830> just<00:03:09.310> keeping<00:03:09.610> an<00:03:09.760> eye

on really babysitting the plant to make

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.860 
on really babysitting the plant to make
sure<00:03:12.670> that<00:03:12.820> everything<00:03:13.210> is<00:03:13.270> running<00:03:13.450> smoothly

sure that everything is running smoothly
I<00:03:14.230> go<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.280> work<00:03:15.610> I<00:03:16.000> do<00:03:16.720> one<00:03:17.320> round<00:03:17.560> we<00:03:18.130> normally

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
I go to work I do one round we normally

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.500 
I go to work I do one round we normally
have<00:03:18.610> to<00:03:18.730> take<00:03:18.910> numbers<00:03:19.450> sometimes<00:03:20.280> samples

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
have to take numbers sometimes samples

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.320 
have to take numbers sometimes samples
taurine<00:03:22.510> or<00:03:22.990> any<00:03:23.800> other<00:03:24.130> MLS<00:03:24.610> as<00:03:24.790> any<00:03:25.000> type<00:03:25.300> of

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
taurine or any other MLS as any type of

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.490 
taurine or any other MLS as any type of
samples<00:03:26.010> then<00:03:27.010> you<00:03:28.000> know<00:03:28.150> around<00:03:28.900> can<00:03:29.230> take

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
samples then you know around can take

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.640 
samples then you know around can take
about<00:03:31.590> from<00:03:32.590> 30<00:03:33.070> minutes<00:03:33.310> to<00:03:34.180> two<00:03:34.360> hours<00:03:34.650> and

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
about from 30 minutes to two hours and

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.500 
about from 30 minutes to two hours and
you<00:03:35.890> might<00:03:36.040> think<00:03:36.250> well<00:03:36.370> why<00:03:36.670> because

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
you might think well why because

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.420 
you might think well why because
sometimes<00:03:38.020> you<00:03:38.200> go<00:03:38.410> and<00:03:38.620> you<00:03:38.709> can<00:03:38.890> find<00:03:39.220> a

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
sometimes you go and you can find a

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.479 
sometimes you go and you can find a
problem<00:03:40.080> and<00:03:41.080> then<00:03:41.470> we<00:03:41.590> have<00:03:41.890> to<00:03:42.070> solve<00:03:42.310> it

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
problem and then we have to solve it

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.800 
problem and then we have to solve it
there's<00:03:43.360> so<00:03:43.480> many<00:03:43.570> things<00:03:43.840> that<00:03:44.020> happen<00:03:44.560> that

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
there's so many things that happen that

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.590 
there's so many things that happen that
and<00:03:46.810> they're<00:03:46.989> always<00:03:47.260> so<00:03:47.890> different<00:03:48.370> I<00:03:48.880> mean

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
and they're always so different I mean

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.330 
and they're always so different I mean
it's<00:03:49.840> a<00:03:49.930> fine<00:03:50.140> job<00:03:50.350> is<00:03:50.680> so<00:03:51.280> dynamic<00:03:51.459> you<00:03:51.970> have<00:03:52.150> a

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
it's a fine job is so dynamic you have a

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.190 
it's a fine job is so dynamic you have a
you're<00:03:54.340> always<00:03:54.459> working<00:03:55.150> doing<00:03:55.810> different

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
you're always working doing different

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.449 
you're always working doing different
different<00:03:56.950> things

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
different things

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.150 
different things
some<00:03:57.940> days<00:03:58.150> are<00:03:58.360> really<00:03:58.840> really<00:03:59.590> slow<00:03:59.709> so<00:03:59.860> you

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
some days are really really slow so you

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.830 
some days are really really slow so you
want<00:04:00.459> to<00:04:00.610> prevent<00:04:00.910> the<00:04:01.060> maintenance<00:04:01.480> you<00:04:01.630> want

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
want to prevent the maintenance you want

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.830 
want to prevent the maintenance you want
checking<00:04:02.230> a<00:04:02.290> start<00:04:02.590> they<00:04:03.250> need<00:04:03.280> to<00:04:03.459> be<00:04:03.550> checked

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
checking a start they need to be checked

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.350 
checking a start they need to be checked
some<00:04:04.840> others<00:04:05.440> are<00:04:05.620> really<00:04:05.830> busy<00:04:06.360> interesting

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
some others are really busy interesting

all<00:04:10.300> the<00:04:10.390> time<00:04:10.600> I<00:04:10.810> get<00:04:11.770> to<00:04:11.890> be<00:04:11.950> outside<00:04:12.520> a<00:04:12.790> lot

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
all the time I get to be outside a lot

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.560 
all the time I get to be outside a lot
you're<00:04:14.140> constantly<00:04:14.590> learning<00:04:15.359> it's<00:04:16.359> pretty

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
you're constantly learning it's pretty

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.750 
you're constantly learning it's pretty
much<00:04:16.660> like<00:04:16.720> a<00:04:16.930> doctor<00:04:17.320> you<00:04:18.070> know<00:04:18.190> you<00:04:18.640> never

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
much like a doctor you know you never

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.909 
much like a doctor you know you never
stop<00:04:19.180> started<00:04:19.570> really<00:04:19.840> you<00:04:20.140> can<00:04:20.320> learn<00:04:20.500> some

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
stop started really you can learn some

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.890 
stop started really you can learn some
of<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.730> wastewater<00:04:22.030> industry<00:04:22.360> through

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
of the wastewater industry through

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.080 
of the wastewater industry through
schooling<00:04:23.200> but<00:04:23.500> you<00:04:23.860> can<00:04:24.100> only<00:04:24.550> learn<00:04:25.030> the

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
schooling but you can only learn the

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.030 
schooling but you can only learn the
plot<00:04:25.450> by<00:04:25.810> actually<00:04:26.140> working<00:04:26.320> there<00:04:26.620> in<00:04:26.890> order

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
plot by actually working there in order

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.340 
plot by actually working there in order
to<00:04:27.610> work<00:04:27.820> in<00:04:28.150> the<00:04:28.419> industry<00:04:28.810> you<00:04:28.930> need<00:04:29.050> to<00:04:29.200> have

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
to work in the industry you need to have
