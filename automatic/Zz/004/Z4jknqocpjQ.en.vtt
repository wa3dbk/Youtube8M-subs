cover<00:00:10.090> a<00:00:10.180> question<00:00:10.629> that<00:00:10.780> we<00:00:10.870> had<00:00:11.110> come<00:00:11.559> up

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:11.680 
cover a question that we had come up

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.680 
cover a question that we had come up
when<00:00:11.889> somebody<00:00:12.100> that<00:00:12.340> I'll<00:00:12.430> post<00:00:12.610> here<00:00:13.539> with

when somebody that I'll post here with

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.900 
when somebody that I'll post here with
us<00:00:13.809> on<00:00:13.990> Facebook<00:00:14.440> about<00:00:14.559> whey<00:00:15.430> protein<00:00:15.879> and

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.910 
us on Facebook about whey protein and

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.160 
us on Facebook about whey protein and
there<00:00:16.119> was<00:00:16.209> some<00:00:16.330> confusion<00:00:16.869> about<00:00:16.960> the

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
there was some confusion about the

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.540 
there was some confusion about the
differences<00:00:17.590> between<00:00:17.650> whey<00:00:18.100> protein

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
differences between whey protein

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.820 
differences between whey protein

just<00:00:24.970> so<00:00:25.150> you<00:00:25.419> know<00:00:25.570> is<00:00:25.779> the<00:00:25.900> byproduct<00:00:26.289> of

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:26.769 
just so you know is the byproduct of

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:28.980 
just so you know is the byproduct of
cheese<00:00:27.369> manufacturing<00:00:28.119> it's<00:00:28.570> got<00:00:28.749> a<00:00:28.779> really

glutathione levels it can act as an
antioxidant<00:00:55.230> it's<00:00:56.230> also<00:00:56.379> been<00:00:56.589> demonstrated

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
antioxidant it's also been demonstrated

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.919 
antioxidant it's also been demonstrated
the<00:00:57.160> anti-carcinogenic<00:00:57.730> so<00:00:58.239> whey<00:00:58.420> is<00:00:58.600> really

00:00:58.919 --> 00:00:58.929 
the anti-carcinogenic so whey is really

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:01.650 
the anti-carcinogenic so whey is really
a<00:00:58.960> superfood<00:00:59.649> now<00:01:00.219> some<00:01:00.940> people<00:01:01.239> are<00:01:01.390> allergic

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
a superfood now some people are allergic

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.959 
a superfood now some people are allergic
to<00:01:01.870> way<00:01:02.109> so<00:01:02.170> not<00:01:02.890> it's<00:01:03.070> not<00:01:03.160> common<00:01:03.579> but<00:01:03.730> it<00:01:03.850> is

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
to way so not it's not common but it is

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:05.910 
to way so not it's not common but it is
an<00:01:04.120> allergy<00:01:04.780> that<00:01:05.050> some<00:01:05.320> people<00:01:05.560> have<00:01:05.710> so

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
an allergy that some people have so

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.450 
an allergy that some people have so
that's<00:01:06.040> something<00:01:06.760> to<00:01:06.910> consider<00:01:08.130> now<00:01:09.130> back<00:01:09.430> to

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
that's something to consider now back to

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.330 
that's something to consider now back to
the<00:01:09.700> forms<00:01:10.240> now<00:01:10.390> whey<00:01:10.570> protein<00:01:11.100> isolate<00:01:12.100> first

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
the forms now whey protein isolate first

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.060 
the forms now whey protein isolate first
concentrate<00:01:12.970> what<00:01:13.479> makes<00:01:13.689> a<00:01:13.840> protein<00:01:14.439> isolate

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
concentrate what makes a protein isolate

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.770 
concentrate what makes a protein isolate
nicely<00:01:15.520> is<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:15.820> fact<00:01:16.000> that<00:01:16.090> it<00:01:16.270> has<00:01:16.420> to<00:01:16.570> be<00:01:16.689> at

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
nicely is the fact that it has to be at

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.440 
nicely is the fact that it has to be at
least<00:01:16.810> 90<00:01:17.380> percent<00:01:17.409> protein<00:01:18.270> there's<00:01:19.270> other

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
least 90 percent protein there's other

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.060 
least 90 percent protein there's other
things<00:01:19.509> obviously<00:01:20.200> to<00:01:20.259> consider<00:01:20.590> there's<00:01:20.799> fat

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
things obviously to consider there's fat

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.370 
things obviously to consider there's fat
lactose<00:01:21.790> things<00:01:22.060> like<00:01:22.240> that<00:01:22.390> the<00:01:22.840> process<00:01:23.320> of

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
lactose things like that the process of

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.109 
lactose things like that the process of
taking<00:01:23.560> away<00:01:23.799> from<00:01:24.130> its<00:01:24.280> byproduct<00:01:24.820> of<00:01:24.909> cheese

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
taking away from its byproduct of cheese

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.850 
taking away from its byproduct of cheese
and<00:01:25.329> filtering<00:01:25.689> out<00:01:25.869> the<00:01:25.899> cholesterol<00:01:26.649> the

I<00:01:30.939> said<00:01:31.149> fat<00:01:31.329> twice<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:31.750> urban<00:01:31.899> areas<00:01:32.110> and

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
I said fat twice the urban areas and

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.800 
I said fat twice the urban areas and
filtering<00:01:33.100> that<00:01:33.189> stuff<00:01:33.399> out<00:01:33.549> is<00:01:33.820> what's<00:01:34.659> going

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
filtering that stuff out is what's going

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.240 
filtering that stuff out is what's going
to<00:01:34.869> determine<00:01:35.020> hey<00:01:35.530> one<00:01:35.770> type<00:01:35.979> of<00:01:36.009> protein

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
to determine hey one type of protein

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.100 
to determine hey one type of protein
isn't<00:01:36.610> is<00:01:36.850> it<00:01:36.880> if<00:01:37.090> it's<00:01:37.210> less<00:01:37.420> than<00:01:37.450> 90<00:01:37.960> percent

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.389 
isn't is it if it's less than 90 percent
it's<00:01:38.829> going<00:01:39.009> to<00:01:39.070> be<00:01:39.159> a<00:01:39.189> whey<00:01:39.369> protein

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
it's going to be a whey protein

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.550 
it's going to be a whey protein
concentrate<00:01:39.820> now<00:01:40.570> there<00:01:41.020> are<00:01:41.170> various

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
concentrate now there are various

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.249 
concentrate now there are various
methods<00:01:42.159> to<00:01:42.340> separate<00:01:42.880> out<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.630> byproducts

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
methods to separate out the byproducts

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.010 
methods to separate out the byproducts
of<00:01:44.350> way<00:01:44.530> if<00:01:44.710> you<00:01:44.829> will<00:01:45.070> there<00:01:45.909> is<00:01:46.119> ion<00:01:46.630> exchange

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
of way if you will there is ion exchange

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.359 
of way if you will there is ion exchange
which<00:01:47.350> is<00:01:47.380> a<00:01:47.530> process<00:01:47.979> where<00:01:48.159> we<00:01:48.250> use

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
which is a process where we use

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.060 
which is a process where we use
chemicals<00:01:48.880> and<00:01:49.149> use<00:01:49.270> charges<00:01:49.780> to<00:01:50.710> exploit

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070

the<00:03:32.310> reasons<00:03:32.640> mentioned<00:03:32.700> before<00:03:33.300> now<00:03:33.810> this<00:03:33.990> is

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
the reasons mentioned before now this is

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.870 
the reasons mentioned before now this is
often<00:03:34.350> not<00:03:34.650> disclosed<00:03:35.100> and<00:03:35.280> label<00:03:35.580> usually

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
often not disclosed and label usually

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.430 
often not disclosed and label usually
it's<00:03:36.000> just<00:03:36.030> weight<00:03:36.300> protein<00:03:36.660> concentrate<00:03:37.260> and

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
it's just weight protein concentrate and

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.660 
it's just weight protein concentrate and
sometimes<00:03:37.770> you<00:03:37.890> get<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.100> percentage<00:03:38.520> of

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
sometimes you get the percentage of

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
protein 84 or something like that that's

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
it's a whey protein isolate and then

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.140 
it's a whey protein isolate and then
what<00:03:52.980> they<00:03:53.100> do<00:03:53.160> is<00:03:53.280> they<00:03:53.610> take<00:03:53.820> it<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:54.090> they

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
what they do is they take it and they

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.570 
what they do is they take it and they
chop<00:03:54.420> it<00:03:54.450> up<00:03:54.660> into<00:03:54.840> smaller<00:03:55.140> peptides

for him so that may not be worth it when

for him so that may not be worth it when
you<00:04:50.460> hydrolyze<00:04:51.000> it<00:04:51.180> too<00:04:51.330> much<00:04:51.510> when<00:04:51.780> you<00:04:51.840> take

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
you hydrolyze it too much when you take

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.170 
you hydrolyze it too much when you take

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
it down too far that ends up to veteran

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.300 
it down too far that ends up to veteran
it's<00:04:54.300> very<00:04:54.480> difficult<00:04:54.870> to<00:04:55.050> flavor<00:04:55.290> so<00:04:55.920> those

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
it's very difficult to flavor so those

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.880 
it's very difficult to flavor so those
are<00:04:56.430> things<00:04:56.550> to<00:04:56.700> consider<00:04:57.380> other<00:04:58.380> questions

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890

we<00:04:58.980> had<00:04:59.220> one<00:04:59.610> over<00:04:59.760> the<00:04:59.850> pros<00:05:00.090> and<00:05:00.270> cons<00:05:00.800> I

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
we had one over the pros and cons I

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.040 
we had one over the pros and cons I
think<00:05:02.820> I<00:05:03.000> think<00:05:03.270> we<00:05:03.330> covered<00:05:03.510> everything<00:05:03.810> in

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
think I think we covered everything in

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.020 
think I think we covered everything in
this<00:05:04.110> one<00:05:04.320> anta<00:05:04.590> yeah<00:05:05.220> he<00:05:05.400> Jeff's<00:05:05.730> the<00:05:05.820> one<00:05:05.880> who

posted it on Facebook and said hey

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.750 
posted it on Facebook and said hey
there's<00:05:07.830> a<00:05:07.860> lot<00:05:07.950> of<00:05:08.040> confusion<00:05:08.370> out<00:05:08.550> here

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
there's a lot of confusion out here

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.430 
there's a lot of confusion out here
about<00:05:09.000> the<00:05:09.360> different<00:05:09.720> types<00:05:09.900> of<00:05:10.050> ways<00:05:10.230> so

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
about the different types of ways so

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.380 
about the different types of ways so
real<00:05:10.650> quick<00:05:10.830> to<00:05:10.980> recap<00:05:11.310> there's<00:05:11.580> we<00:05:12.000> protein

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
real quick to recap there's we protein

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
isolate at least 90 percent protein and

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.570

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
then within whey protein isolate it's

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.700 
then within whey protein isolate it's
either<00:05:17.730> ion<00:05:18.090> exchange<00:05:18.420> or<00:05:18.660> micro<00:05:19.110> filter<00:05:19.500> or

either ion exchange or micro filter or

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.560 
either ion exchange or micro filter or
sometimes<00:05:20.400> you'll<00:05:20.550> see<00:05:20.700> cross<00:05:20.970> flow<00:05:21.210> micro

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570

is you know separate it out with the
water<00:05:30.020> you<00:05:31.020> know<00:05:31.110> the<00:05:31.260> fat<00:05:31.500> lactose

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
water you know the fat lactose

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.440 
water you know the fat lactose
cholesterol<00:05:32.580> and<00:05:32.730> there<00:05:32.880> same<00:05:33.120> holds<00:05:33.390> true

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
cholesterol and there same holds true

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.360

for<00:05:33.600> a<00:05:33.750> concentrate<00:05:34.260> and<00:05:34.440> then<00:05:34.830> hydrolyzed

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
for a concentrate and then hydrolyzed

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.770 
for a concentrate and then hydrolyzed
and<00:05:35.400> take<00:05:35.730> it<00:05:35.880> chop<00:05:36.210> it<00:05:36.330> up<00:05:36.360> into<00:05:36.510> smaller

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
and take it chop it up into smaller

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.600 
and take it chop it up into smaller
pieces<00:05:37.020> because<00:05:37.530> hey<00:05:37.800> we<00:05:38.070> need<00:05:38.190> to<00:05:38.340> absorb

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
pieces because hey we need to absorb

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.310 
pieces because hey we need to absorb
super<00:05:38.970> fast<00:05:39.180> otherwise<00:05:39.420> won't<00:05:39.810> work<00:05:39.960> which<00:05:40.200> is

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
super fast otherwise won't work which is

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.880 
super fast otherwise won't work which is
not<00:05:40.500> true<00:05:40.850> so<00:05:41.850> keep<00:05:42.510> that<00:05:42.660> stuff<00:05:42.930> in<00:05:43.080> mind<00:05:43.290> last

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
not true so keep that stuff in mind last

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.070 
not true so keep that stuff in mind last
I'll<00:05:44.100> say<00:05:44.310> another<00:05:44.760> probe<00:05:45.060> to<00:05:45.480> a<00:05:45.510> whey<00:05:45.750> protein

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
I'll say another probe to a whey protein

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.540 
I'll say another probe to a whey protein
isolate<00:05:46.440> my<00:05:46.560> opinions<00:05:46.950> I<00:05:47.010> found<00:05:47.220> the<00:05:47.280> taste

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
isolate my opinions I found the taste

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.450 
isolate my opinions I found the taste
butter<00:05:47.760> it<00:05:48.240> mix<00:05:48.540> a<00:05:48.660> little<00:05:48.780> bit<00:05:48.990> easier<00:05:49.460> those

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
butter it mix a little bit easier those

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.950 
butter it mix a little bit easier those
are<00:05:50.610> subjective<00:05:51.120> feelings<00:05:51.450> again<00:05:51.690> if<00:05:51.840> you're

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
are subjective feelings again if you're

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.480 
are subjective feelings again if you're
not<00:05:52.080> lactose<00:05:52.260> intolerant<00:05:53.010> and<00:05:53.070> you<00:05:53.160> find<00:05:53.400> a

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
not lactose intolerant and you find a

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.610 
not lactose intolerant and you find a
high<00:05:53.640> quality<00:05:54.030> whey<00:05:54.150> concentrate<00:05:54.360> if<00:05:55.200> I<00:05:55.320> save

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
high quality whey concentrate if I save

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.470 
high quality whey concentrate if I save
some<00:05:55.650> money<00:05:56.010> and<00:05:56.220> use<00:05:57.000> it<00:05:57.030> there's<00:05:57.330> nothing

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:57.480 
some money and use it there's nothing

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.190 
some money and use it there's nothing
wrong<00:05:57.780> with<00:05:57.840> that

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.200 
wrong with that

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.530 
wrong with that
again<00:05:58.770> I<00:05:58.800> just<00:05:59.040> stick<00:05:59.190> with<00:05:59.310> the<00:05:59.520> cff<00:06:00.360> whey

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:00.540 
again I just stick with the cff whey

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.860 
again I just stick with the cff whey
isolate<00:06:00.960> personally<00:06:01.820> yeah<00:06:02.880> temperature<00:06:03.390> pH

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
isolate personally yeah temperature pH

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.180 
isolate personally yeah temperature pH
these<00:06:04.140> are<00:06:04.260> all<00:06:04.380> things<00:06:04.710> that<00:06:04.830> are<00:06:04.950> going<00:06:05.130> to

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
these are all things that are going to

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.710 
these are all things that are going to
be<00:06:05.280> affected<00:06:05.760> during<00:06:05.940> the<00:06:06.030> processing<00:06:06.510> away

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
be affected during the processing away

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.890 
be affected during the processing away
so<00:06:06.780> the<00:06:07.080> idea<00:06:07.410> is<00:06:07.680> to<00:06:08.130> take<00:06:08.340> the<00:06:09.330> way<00:06:09.480> from<00:06:09.780> its

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
so the idea is to take the way from its

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.330 
so the idea is to take the way from its
native<00:06:10.140> state<00:06:10.290> you<00:06:10.680> know<00:06:10.770> right<00:06:10.980> out<00:06:11.010> from

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
native state you know right out from

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.670 
native state you know right out from
being<00:06:11.880> a<00:06:11.970> byproduct<00:06:12.270> of<00:06:12.510> cheese<00:06:12.750> and<00:06:12.960> get<00:06:13.560> it

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
being a byproduct of cheese and get it

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.290 
being a byproduct of cheese and get it
get<00:06:14.010> as<00:06:14.100> much<00:06:14.250> of<00:06:14.310> the<00:06:14.490> junk<00:06:14.790> out<00:06:14.910> of<00:06:15.090> the<00:06:15.180> dish

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
get as much of the junk out of the dish

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.560 
get as much of the junk out of the dish
if<00:06:15.510> you<00:06:16.020> will<00:06:16.140> without<00:06:16.910> damaging<00:06:17.910> the<00:06:18.150> protein

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
if you will without damaging the protein

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.990 
if you will without damaging the protein
itself<00:06:18.840> that's<00:06:19.200> the<00:06:19.350> whole<00:06:19.620> goal<00:06:20.010> so<00:06:20.430> you<00:06:20.850> guys
