these<00:00:46.320> still<00:00:46.649> work<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.370> we've<00:00:47.579> work<00:00:47.910> as

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
these still work and that we've work as

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.819 
these still work and that we've work as
well<00:00:48.270> but<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.160> did<00:00:50.160> do<00:00:50.760> one<00:00:51.030> for<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.420> like<00:00:52.410> here

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
well but I did do one for that like here

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.910 
well but I did do one for that like here
I<00:00:53.090> just<00:00:54.090> laid<00:00:54.510> down<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.750> simple<00:00:55.289> like<00:00:55.440> storage

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
I just laid down a simple like storage

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.310 
I just laid down a simple like storage
wall<00:00:56.219> pretty<00:00:56.760> much<00:00:58.399> unmarked<00:01:00.109> luck<00:01:01.520> on<00:01:02.520> my

block<00:01:04.320> works<00:01:05.159> for<00:01:05.430> all<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.700> them<00:01:05.990> and<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.140> is

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
block works for all of them and this is

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.789 
block works for all of them and this is
made<00:01:07.530> possible<00:01:07.560> by<00:01:08.220> my<00:01:08.460> over<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.330> under

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799

strategy for redstone why am I always
needing<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.850> sleep<00:01:15.180> when<00:01:15.390> i'll<00:01:15.630> sleep<00:01:15.869> before

before<00:01:17.790> we<00:01:18.119> get<00:01:18.270> going<00:01:19.490> i'm<00:01:20.490> just<00:01:20.549> going<00:01:20.820> to

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
before we get going i'm just going to

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.310 
before we get going i'm just going to
show<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.270> over<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.659> under<00:01:21.750> technique

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
show you the over and under technique

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.100 
show you the over and under technique
and<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:23.340> can<00:01:23.549> pretty<00:01:23.759> much<00:01:23.850> take<00:01:24.180> my<00:01:24.420> storage

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
and you can pretty much take my storage

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.640 
and you can pretty much take my storage
room<00:01:25.470> area<00:01:26.540> our<00:01:27.540> storage<00:01:27.869> room<00:01:28.110> design<00:01:28.470> and

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
room area our storage room design and

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.679 
room area our storage room design and
use<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:29.040> your<00:01:29.250> world<00:01:29.490> or<00:01:29.790> whatever<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.360> don't

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
use in your world or whatever I don't

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.240 
use in your world or whatever I don't
really<00:01:30.930> care<00:01:31.640> but<00:01:32.640> anyway<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:34.250> switch

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
really care but anyway so the switch

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.330 
really care but anyway so the switch
will<00:01:35.400> be<00:01:35.549> here<00:01:35.850> will<00:01:36.840> be<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.409> left<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:38.040> each

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
will be here will be to the left of each

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.990 
will be here will be to the left of each
of<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.700> blocks<00:01:39.829> then<00:01:40.829> obviously<00:01:41.040> we<00:01:41.579> need<00:01:41.850> to

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
of the blocks then obviously we need to

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.450 
of the blocks then obviously we need to
put<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.240> block<00:01:42.509> there<00:01:42.799> so<00:01:43.799> let<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.040> redstone

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
put a block there so let the redstone

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.870 
put a block there so let the redstone
can<00:01:44.670> reach<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.970> switch<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:46.369> have<00:01:47.369> two<00:01:47.610> blocks

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
can reach the switch I have two blocks

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.830 
can reach the switch I have two blocks
and<00:01:49.399> then<00:01:50.399> i'll<00:01:50.520> show<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.970> under<00:01:51.329> which

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and then i'll show you the under which

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.109 
and then i'll show you the under which
is<00:01:53.270> imagine<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.420> there<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:56.689> piston<00:01:57.920> face

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
is imagine that there is a piston face

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.819 
is imagine that there is a piston face
click<00:02:00.119> facing<00:02:01.100> that<00:02:02.100> way<00:02:03.590> imagine<00:02:04.590> that's<00:02:04.740> a

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
click facing that way imagine that's a

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:05.840 
click facing that way imagine that's a
piston

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
piston

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.710 
piston
this<00:02:06.659> will<00:02:06.840> be<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:06.990> under<00:02:07.439> technique<00:02:07.890> oh<00:02:08.720> my

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
this will be the under technique oh my

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.260 
this will be the under technique oh my
god<00:02:11.750> this<00:02:12.750> will<00:02:12.930> be<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.170> under<00:02:13.470> technique<00:02:14.270> you

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
god this will be the under technique you

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.470 
god this will be the under technique you
just<00:02:15.300> pretty<00:02:15.690> much<00:02:15.840> wire<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:16.290> from<00:02:16.530> that

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
just pretty much wire it from that

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.630 
just pretty much wire it from that
around<00:02:18.480> that's<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.989> under<00:02:19.319> so<00:02:20.190> every<00:02:20.489> other

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
around that's the under so every other

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.630 
around that's the under so every other
one<00:02:21.030> you're<00:02:21.270> going<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.450> do<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.720> under<00:02:22.459> and<00:02:23.459> the

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
one you're going to do the under and the

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.600 
one you're going to do the under and the
over<00:02:24.110> that's<00:02:25.110> still<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.500> piston<00:02:26.690> imagine<00:02:28.610> or

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
over that's still the piston imagine or

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.830 
over that's still the piston imagine or
not<00:02:29.790> imagine<00:02:30.209> but<00:02:30.560> then<00:02:31.560> you<00:02:31.680> just<00:02:31.860> do<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.840> go

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
not imagine but then you just do that go

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.250 
not imagine but then you just do that go
down<00:02:33.989> one<00:02:34.230> block<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.770> then<00:02:35.550> like<00:02:35.940> that<00:02:36.260> and

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
down one block and then like that and

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.090 
down one block and then like that and
that's<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:37.950> over<00:02:38.370> technique<00:02:38.850> so<00:02:39.830> you<00:02:40.830> want<00:02:41.010> to

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
that's the over technique so you want to

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.479 
that's the over technique so you want to
start<00:02:41.130> out<00:02:41.489> with<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:41.730> under<00:02:42.800> then<00:02:43.800> over<00:02:44.010> then

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
start out with the under then over then

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.960 
start out with the under then over then
under<00:02:44.880> then<00:02:45.239> open<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:45.959> under<00:02:46.319> and<00:02:46.620> over<00:02:46.970> it's

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
under then open and under and over it's

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.550 
under then open and under and over it's
just<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.239> really<00:02:48.480> simple<00:02:48.840> way<00:02:49.019> to<00:02:49.200> have

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
just a really simple way to have

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.120 
just a really simple way to have
individual<00:02:50.190> switches<00:02:51.319> so<00:02:52.319> I<00:02:52.350> what<00:02:52.769> is<00:02:52.950> that

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
individual switches so I what is that

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.830 
individual switches so I what is that
when<00:02:53.580> you<00:02:53.730> walk<00:02:53.970> in<00:02:54.180> you<00:02:54.300> don't<00:02:54.420> have<00:02:54.600> to<00:02:54.720> go

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
when you walk in you don't have to go

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.300 
when you walk in you don't have to go
down<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.050> click<00:02:55.410> all<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:55.739> them<00:02:55.890> for<00:02:56.100> all<00:02:56.250> of

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
down and click all of them for all of

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.759 
down and click all of them for all of
them<00:02:56.670> they'll<00:02:56.850> be<00:02:56.970> unlocked<00:02:57.330> you<00:02:58.290> can<00:02:58.500> go<00:02:58.620> into

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
them they'll be unlocked you can go into

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.620 
them they'll be unlocked you can go into
an<00:02:58.920> individual<00:02:59.459> and<00:02:59.670> take<00:03:00.060> out<00:03:00.209> what<00:03:00.360> you<00:03:00.390> need

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
an individual and take out what you need

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.100 
an individual and take out what you need
long<00:03:01.170> ago<00:03:02.030> but<00:03:03.030> uh<00:03:03.060> thanks<00:03:03.660> for<00:03:03.780> watching<00:03:04.080> guys

I<00:03:06.810> idea<00:03:07.410> because<00:03:07.769> i<00:03:08.010> think<00:03:08.850> i'm<00:03:08.970> going<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.209> do

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
I idea because i think i'm going to do

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.890 
I idea because i think i'm going to do
something<00:03:09.840> like<00:03:09.870> this<00:03:10.170> i<00:03:10.410> might<00:03:10.620> work<00:03:11.310> on<00:03:11.519> it

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
something like this i might work on it

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.960 
something like this i might work on it
maybe<00:03:12.900> make<00:03:13.170> large<00:03:13.650> chest<00:03:14.070> once<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.610> where<00:03:14.850> it

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
maybe make large chest once to where it

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.520 
maybe make large chest once to where it
takes<00:03:15.209> back<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.860> with<00:03:16.860> one<00:03:17.100> piston<00:03:18.079> but<00:03:19.079> i

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
takes back to with one piston but i

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.800 
takes back to with one piston but i
think<00:03:20.489> when<00:03:20.610> i<00:03:20.640> use<00:03:20.850> this<00:03:21.060> for<00:03:21.329> my<00:03:21.450> let's<00:03:21.690> play

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
think when i use this for my let's play

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.289 
think when i use this for my let's play
whenever<00:03:22.200> i<00:03:22.410> started<00:03:22.890> which<00:03:23.220> will<00:03:23.670> most

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
whenever i started which will most

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.259 
whenever i started which will most
