00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.279
 my missions as assassins and indeed they are 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.840
 these, among others, do this 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.930
 missions also during the event 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.460
 that some missions have started again 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.050
 those dedicated to the online so there 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.059
 in fact I'm talking about the missions 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.680

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.960

 especially for the month of August it will be 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.940
 You can play almost all of them 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.920
 to unlock the exclusive clothes 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.230
 exclusive weapons and we burn everything 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.239
 what was exclusive that was obtained 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.329

 we are going to that area and here I am 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.729
 here came guys then I show you 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.950
 a little what the community challenge is 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.770
 available today if I'm not mistaken from 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.600
 July 27th, perhaps from the 28th, however, this is it 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.759
 here really simple guys 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.880
 assassinate two enemies and a pose of 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.369
 very silly rom and this allows you to 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.200
 unlock the explorer outfit 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.970
 let's see here the compliments e 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.759
 passed the challenge with the most minuti in 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.710
 award will receive the actual 2,500 only that 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.320
 I think he saw someone indeed 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.119
 all useless reality is coming down that 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.350
 fuck he kicked the guy but 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.420
 that hurt you 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.790
 quiet guys we don't give ourselves now 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.530
 as if nothing had happened because it is possible 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.479
 that before starting a mission 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.490
 I have to wait all time I'm here 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.710
 then eliminated and finally there 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.100
 we dedicate to our missions 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.770
 secondary 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.200
 let's see a moment as usual 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.790
 some mission is a disastrous escape 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.500
 criminals have escaped from the doors 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.540
 they want to leave the first hand 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.880
 opportunity found there and then kill them 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.890
 guys we accept this time there are not 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.990
 rather strange special conditions 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.149
 among other things, someone wrote to me in 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.709
 comments that the secondary missions of it 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.230
 I'm really a brothel here 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.700
 just 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.159
 killer by the way either 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.099
 checked what the fuck is i wanted to go up 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:20.930
 with having to return, however, I do not have 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.489
 not even checked how many of them 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.920
 therefore remain boys we will do it to 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.170
 short quiet are almost in the area 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.819
 indicated as you see there are really a 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.250
 guards brothel then attract 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.319
 attention would not be the best idea 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.150
 so let's see a little if I can 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.739
 go up a few without anyone there 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.540
 see but come on 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.420
 I hope so anyway guys every time 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.930
 that I see edwards fall let's say a few 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.900
 building 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.209
 I think of strange movements and 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.459
 above all, very fluid with rig while 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.500
 in fact he climbed Notre Dame 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.069
 among other things, I do not see that in the sense that 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.690
 I hope to see those soon 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.750
 particular behaviors however 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.060
 we see my friend where I don't see him and 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.370
 branches of those who fuck fabric or that 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.959
 attention guys let's see not pass by 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.640
 here it seemed to you that he did not pass this way 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.370
 let's see if we can reach it 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.140
 guys from above we could shoot it down 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.730
 then continue to run prof 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.049
 the other is fine I ate but not 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.989
 we care if we see him 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.400
 attention scenes from there but why would i be 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.380
 from this other position among other things there is 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.120
 also someone who pursues him and here he is 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.290
 there guys and ours see if there 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.139
 we can 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.019
 yes indeed very well the killing indeed 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:32.750
 not bad this time but what the fuck you want 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.609
 here you are this is what you 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.130
 you deserve to have attacked me very well 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.239
 so edwards is never rusty 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.220
 really not bad 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.569
 good boy there through a short cut 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.819
 I headed to another location 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.650
 in fact despite wanting to unlock the 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.630
 gun spa someone told me that 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.239
 he also wanted to see some missions 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.980
 naval since unblocking all the contrary 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.650
 completing them all will be possible then 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.109
 even unlock golden swords 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.250
 however private escort corsaro health 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.410
 we captured a ship that 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.060
 he was carrying a precious cargo now 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.500
 so the Spaniards belong to us though 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.329
 disagree have decided to 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.620
 come to take it back, ok, we accept 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.840
 to prescind from the mission that among other things 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.790
 has five difficulty cleats 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.319
 so it will not be at all easy to 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.090
 at least hopefully perform because 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.459
 we want quite high level of challenge 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.760
 however we head inside the 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.190
 our 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.200
 9 and then guys let's go good guys 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.080
 they arrived at their destination as you can see 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.150
 here is the neptune that is not neptune 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.920
 with the bees so really very strange and 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.920
 it is even stranger that it has already reached its destination 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.080
 coveted removed possible year I have to 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.360
 defend it ok I understood exactly the 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.520
 contrary here the boys that is what 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.560
 happens to not read to the end 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.060
 let's say mission descriptions 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.370
 among other things, I hardly see one 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.320
 fuck because unfortunately there is a bit of 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.790
 fog here with hitches I hope to 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.130
 arrive short-range well guys 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.750
 I arrived here at destination between 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.000
 the other there are three ships rather 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.770
 neighbors who are approaching we see 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.410
 if I can hit and take out in a 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.030
 I took only two sluts at a stroke 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.140
 misery like not shooting alea un 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.600
 dick 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.880
 I'm about to destroy the rapt one that 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.130
 poor combined cabbage minus wait 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.220
 then I turn around in such a way as to 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.900
 defeat this little brig 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.130
 what I don't know a gunboat I don't know 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.410
 what it is anyway we beat it 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.840
 clearly yes I did it I just have to 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.820
 be really careful here I have to stay 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.130
 be careful that others do not come because 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.150
 ragazzoni believe that the neptune does not 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.310
 will last long 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.170
 as you can see, other ships are approaching 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.870
 I have to hit now let's see if I can 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:32.450
 peck 3 maybe yes maybe I don't know 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.920
 unfortunately no boys the neptune is 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.290
 really in great difficulty 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.950
 let's see if I can hit now strength 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.750
 by prof 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.450
 we make it edward force continues to 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.950
 attack the devastated you hoped one is 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.770
 been destroyed let's see if I can 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.570
 peck this other let's see 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.850
 I believe so yes we will succeed with the help 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.920
 of neptune to defeat force e 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.740
 instead we guys do yes instead 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.480
 we did it all in fact 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.340
 waiting to be boarded but 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.350
 clearly we destroy them because I believe 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.360
 others will come or at least this is it 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.220
 hope as we want anyway 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.050
 high level of challenge 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.430
 among other things I had not noticed this between 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.530
 which he approaches wants to hit me 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.300
 but it doesn't exist if you don't make it that way 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.400
 then I call exist a ship anyway 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.990
 okay at this point I would say to approach 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.210
 because the latter wanted to attack 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.580
 behind we say that this is not one 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.140
 what quite correct however we do 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.490
 explode the barrels so we make them 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.540
 out a couple 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.760
 and yet I didn't take it out 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.440
 no one sees if we put it on instead 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.150
 no I didn't catch her but yes I do 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.430
 done 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.990
 we ask a couple here maybe a brute 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.930
 we can always eliminate it in this 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.250
 so that he gets excited but doesn't make it 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.750
 I realize that everything is useless 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.060
 just get excited because anyway 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.250
 we will be able to say by boarding the 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.140
 ship we see we hit someone yes 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.180
 so guys first attack went to 

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.250
 sign there is a bad thing here indeed there are 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.030
 two but let's see if I can get around 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.430
 attention 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.140
 indeed we remember with guns it goes like this 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.160
 in this way and let's do a good job 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:58.630
 little and immediately the game action ends 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.890
 guys we have no rivals 

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.020
 so let's see if the mission was 

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:04.140
 completed yes really not bad 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.310
 naval mission 7 private escort
