00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.840
 hi guys back here this time with 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.550
 a different video as you can well see 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.470
 my opponent doesn't hit me and 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.830
 this time it wo n't do a tutorial on 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.660
 skorpio I traditionally start all 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.280
 mortal kombat with score for later 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.659
 obviously go elsewhere 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.679
 that's because I'm not transporting it there 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:19.679
 make a character 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.410
 let's say it combines business with 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.720
 enjoyable means that it is simple 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.279
 use but already good 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.079
 satisfactions 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.520
 at the beginning even if at a level 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.500
 advanced obviously will not hold up 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.629
 comparison with various characters including 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.540
 from what is coming notches from one 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:40.750
 of the most used then probably 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.420
 will be one of the strongest characters 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.180
 of the series for now 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.530
 today I wanted to talk a bit about scorpion in 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.539
 which we will first analyze the specials in which 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.760
 we mainly have the harpoon 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:01:00.000
 dissipation which however has many shelters 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:02.559
 finished and that if you fail marchionne e 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.390
 before returning to parare will put us 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.920
 too much so it will leave too uncovered 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.619
 this thing can be say 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.729
 avoided if you use the coffin because in 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.740
 this way 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:17.930
 you will come back very very first to be 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:20.140
 active in the parade the other species 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.030
 from this one here also here unfortunately 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.670
 separate finds us that 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.220
 with the pil in an opponent then goes 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.830
 used sparingly to use but 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.009
 practically in combo then we'll see how and 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.259
 finally there is this other special from the 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:40.650
 this too slipped if it does not enter 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:43.740
 it's a problem because it leaves us uncovered 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.870
 finally it has invested and strengthened me 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.550
 could save you from the fact that maybe from 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.310
 place to do in the first half but not 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.110
 together 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.360
 after which I use the variation in the 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.940
 unfair as you can see of scorpion 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.880
 since scorpion a bit of difficulty ad 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.150
 enter against the opponent to start 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.380
 the combo because you usually enter like this 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:10.530
 or so or like this one though 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.850
 I don't get there so I have so a or 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.160
 this one that allows you to do 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.340
 this component at auction 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.140
 so let's say he has 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.090
 a medium range you do n't know how 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.030
 attack the labellarte of doing this 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.430
 bad parry then with an injunction 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.849
 so with swords he allows me to enter 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.349
 thus or to remove then of 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.660
 break up some opposing back with 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:36.019
 this point which is very wide of the 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.730
 best even at a very wide distance e 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:42.280
 however we can hit 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:45.080
 the opponent while the other two then 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.299
 hell infernal fire give us 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.090
 of the species to additional luisa that they are 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:52.010
 excellent for lengthening the grave but not for 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.079
 enter a bomb as the score plan 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.480
 suffers from the problem of entering 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.800
 in a combo then it is better to use i 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.620
 right for 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:04.510
 let's cover this mode this 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.730
 bug this defect discord 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.230
 the combos that I mostly use 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.040
 I am once he came in with his shoulder 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.040
 from 5 st 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:21.209
 this is a good combo 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:25.080
 or always so the session when it is 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.080
 seen as doing it well 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.140
 and ok, the last five-a-side football anyway 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:38.440
 usual but now it's better 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:42.159
 then there is this one that is good because it goes to 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.500
 low medium high so maybe he can 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:46.989
 put a little trouble to the opponent from 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.099
 a bit of which to the opponent then what 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.930
 we can do this thing I did 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:56.650
 see first why the unit does it 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:59.019
 well and then we can see a combo col 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.560
 x6 that could be this friction 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.560
 We will buy 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.510
 so you can make the difference 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.660
 the end maybe some peculiarity is 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.090
 that you can turn this off by doing it 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.940
 become in teleport but you see the 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.520
 top bar like 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:30.310
 the one below is completely discharged 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:32.350
 life if I cancel the show 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.360
 therefore feeling can be used 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.490
 I would say that Michele Potentine can be 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.280
 canceled but you will lose all e 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.290
 three bars are deleted go well 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.160
 guys I hope this is the score I got 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:47.560
 enjoyed stopping at the soccer until 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.940
 sea is not what I can do is done up 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.330
 now 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.330
 to the next
