00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
features as well just to improve the

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.390 
features as well just to improve the
overall<00:00:21.680> standard<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.740> living<00:00:22.830> inside<00:00:23.250> the

overall standard of living inside the

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.359 
overall standard of living inside the
tent<00:00:24.470> so<00:00:25.470> then<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.680> extra<00:00:25.920> features<00:00:26.189> we've

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
tent so then the extra features we've

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.330 
tent so then the extra features we've
got<00:00:27.019> the<00:00:28.019> material<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.619> year<00:00:28.859> has<00:00:29.310> a

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
got the material this year has a

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.060 
got the material this year has a
hydrostatic<00:00:30.179> head<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.650> 4,000<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:31.920> it's

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
hydrostatic head a 4,000 so it's

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.620 
hydrostatic head a 4,000 so it's
phenomenally<00:00:32.700> waterproof<00:00:33.210> going<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.540> keep

so we obviously with the kids makes it

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.920 
so we obviously with the kids makes it
really<00:00:47.250> easy<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.610> get<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.239> out<00:00:48.329> and

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
really easy to get in and out and

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.270 
really easy to get in and out and
obviously<00:00:49.170> all<00:00:49.289> these<00:00:49.410> doors<00:00:49.620> as<00:00:49.800> well<00:00:49.829> have

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
obviously all these doors as well have

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.670 
obviously all these doors as well have
those<00:00:50.460> fly<00:00:50.730> net<00:00:50.969> measure<00:00:51.270> linings<00:00:51.930> on<00:00:52.110> just<00:00:52.590> to

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
those fly net measure linings on just to

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.410 
those fly net measure linings on just to
keep<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.949> bugs<00:00:53.160> out<00:00:53.370> but<00:00:53.640> obviously<00:00:53.940> still

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
keep the bugs out but obviously still

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.720 
keep the bugs out but obviously still
maximizing<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.199> airflow<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:56.430> let<00:00:56.550> me<00:00:56.640> go

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
maximizing that airflow so let me go

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.830 
maximizing that airflow so let me go
inside<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.120> take<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.300> closer<00:00:57.449> look<00:00:57.600> at<00:00:57.690> some<00:00:57.719> of

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
inside to take a closer look at some of

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.299 
inside to take a closer look at some of
these<00:00:57.960> features<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.829> also<00:00:58.980> get<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> better

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
these features and also get a better

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.840 
these features and also get a better
feel<00:00:59.520> for<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.699> tent<00:01:00.800> so<00:01:01.800> here<00:01:01.980> inside<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
feel for the tent so here inside the

have inside this is a tension band

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.360 
have inside this is a tension band
system<00:02:51.840> they<00:02:51.960> use<00:02:52.230> so<00:02:52.770> when<00:02:52.890> it's<00:02:53.010> slightly

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370

windy outside or the winds kicking up

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.110 
windy outside or the winds kicking up
instead<00:02:55.890> of<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.040> whole<00:02:56.220> tent<00:02:56.580> moving<00:02:56.940> around

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
instead of the whole tent moving around

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.720 
instead of the whole tent moving around
too<00:02:57.420> much<00:02:57.570> we<00:02:57.930> have<00:02:58.110> these<00:02:58.260> bands<00:02:58.530> in<00:02:58.800> here<00:02:59.010> now

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
too much we have these bands in here now

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.520 
too much we have these bands in here now
don't<00:03:00.180> need<00:03:00.300> these<00:03:00.450> all<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.750> time<00:03:00.960> so

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
don't need these all the time so

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.500 
don't need these all the time so
obviously<00:03:01.860> when<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.100> is<00:03:02.190> windy<00:03:02.520> pop<00:03:03.240> them<00:03:03.390> up

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
obviously when it is windy pop them up

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.940 
obviously when it is windy pop them up
when<00:03:04.050> you<00:03:04.140> don't<00:03:04.320> need<00:03:04.470> them<00:03:04.710> there's<00:03:04.920> a

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
when you don't need them there's a

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:05.870 
when you don't need them there's a
little<00:03:05.040> quick<00:03:05.280> or<00:03:05.370> at<00:03:05.430> least<00:03:05.550> clip<00:03:05.700> at<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.820> top

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
little quick or at least clip at the top

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.470 
little quick or at least clip at the top
here

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
here

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.140 
here
she<00:03:06.750> just<00:03:06.900> unclips<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:08.370> then<00:03:08.520> fold<00:03:08.850> this<00:03:09.000> all

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
she just unclips and then fold this all

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.970 
she just unclips and then fold this all
up<00:03:09.360> I<00:03:09.630> think<00:03:09.960> there's<00:03:10.140> a<00:03:10.200> little<00:03:10.350> stash<00:03:10.680> pouch

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
up I think there's a little stash pouch

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.800 
up I think there's a little stash pouch
just<00:03:11.460> behind<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.850> pallet<00:03:12.180> on<00:03:12.210> the<00:03:12.270> side<00:03:12.510> here

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
just behind the pallet on the side here

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.120

great handy little feature to have

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.490 
great handy little feature to have
obviously<00:03:17.880> when<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.780> weather<00:03:18.990> turns<00:03:19.410> a

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
obviously when the weather turns a

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.810 
obviously when the weather turns a
little<00:03:19.590> bit<00:03:19.740> nasty<00:03:22.310> so<00:03:23.310> move<00:03:23.459> around<00:03:23.550> to<00:03:23.790> the

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
little bit nasty so move around to the

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.150 
little bit nasty so move around to the
other<00:03:23.940> side<00:03:24.440> one<00:03:25.440> of<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.560> features<00:03:25.860> we<00:03:26.010> didn't

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
other side one of the features we didn't

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.580 
other side one of the features we didn't
mention<00:03:26.520> before<00:03:26.670> is<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.420> nice<00:03:27.570> large<00:03:27.959> window

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
mention before is the nice large window

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.140 
mention before is the nice large window
so<00:03:28.800> they've<00:03:28.920> also<00:03:29.070> increased<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.880> number<00:03:30.120> of

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
so they've also increased the number of

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.510 
so they've also increased the number of
windows<00:03:30.540> in<00:03:30.720> here<00:03:30.930> as<00:03:31.050> well<00:03:31.230> so<00:03:31.500> we've<00:03:32.130> got<00:03:32.280> two

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
windows in here as well so we've got two

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.960 
windows in here as well so we've got two
large<00:03:32.790> ones<00:03:33.120> on<00:03:33.510> each<00:03:34.170> side<00:03:34.820> really<00:03:35.820> do

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
large ones on each side really do

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.760 
large ones on each side really do
maximize<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.660> amount<00:03:36.720> lights<00:03:37.110> inside<00:03:37.530> here

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
maximize the amount lights inside here

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:38.840 
maximize the amount lights inside here
so<00:03:37.860> to<00:03:37.950> read<00:03:38.100> doesn't<00:03:38.280> make<00:03:38.370> it<00:03:38.490> really<00:03:38.730> nice

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
so to read doesn't make it really nice

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:39.770 
so to read doesn't make it really nice
and<00:03:38.910> comfortable
