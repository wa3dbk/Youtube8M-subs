hi this is chris from redshift and i
thought<00:00:03.060> i<00:00:03.120> would<00:00:03.680> explain<00:00:04.680> how<00:00:05.009> the

what<00:00:57.270> does<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.510> mean<00:00:58.219> the<00:00:59.219> front<00:00:59.520> shock<00:01:01.969> like

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
what does that mean the front shock like

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.240 
what does that mean the front shock like
on<00:01:03.210> many<00:01:03.510> cars<00:01:04.309> aesthetic<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.489> one<00:01:05.700> Subaru<00:01:07.250> BMW

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
Coney uses an insert and what that means

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.929 
Coney uses an insert and what that means
is<00:01:14.159> what<00:01:15.000> comes<00:01:15.210> off<00:01:15.420> your<00:01:15.659> car<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.280> this

is a strut shock whatever you want to
call<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.720> basically<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.290> same<00:01:22.470> thing<00:01:22.939> strut<00:01:23.939> a

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
call it basically the same thing strut a

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.170 
call it basically the same thing strut a
certain<00:01:24.420> kind<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.659> shock<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.310> what

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
certain kind of shock and this is what

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.580 
certain kind of shock and this is what
you<00:01:27.330> need<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.600> end<00:01:27.689> up<00:01:27.840> with<00:01:27.869> because<00:01:28.170> what<00:01:28.530> you

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
you need to end up with because what you

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.620 
you need to end up with because what you
take<00:01:28.770> off<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.130> car<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.640> obviously<00:01:30.329> that's

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
take off the car and obviously that's

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.960 
take off the car and obviously that's
not<00:01:30.750> gonna<00:01:30.960> work<00:01:31.020> all<00:01:31.259> by<00:01:31.290> itself<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:32.790> what

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
not gonna work all by itself and so what

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.830 
not gonna work all by itself and so what
Kony<00:01:33.270> has<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.630> do<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.990> cut<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.560> apart<00:01:35.840> and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
Kony has you do is cut this apart and

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.490 
Kony has you do is cut this apart and
what<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.170> end<00:01:37.200> up<00:01:37.409> with<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:38.310> cut<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.610> apart<00:01:39.500> is

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
what you end up with you cut it apart is

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.880 
what you end up with you cut it apart is
this<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.729> can<00:01:41.939> sort<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.450> see<00:01:42.990> what<00:01:43.320> has

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
this you can sort of see what has

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.580 
this you can sort of see what has
happened<00:01:43.920> here<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:44.759> we<00:01:45.720> start<00:01:46.020> with<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.380> we

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
happened here so we start with this we

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.389 
happened here so we start with this we
end<00:01:46.740> up<00:01:46.890> with<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.220> idea<00:01:47.960> being<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.399> once

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
end up with this idea being that once

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.550 
end up with this idea being that once
all<00:01:50.579> was<00:01:50.759> said<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.000> done<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.140> inserted

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
all was said and done this is inserted

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.880 
all was said and done this is inserted
into<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.040> tube<00:01:53.390> it's<00:01:54.390> bolted<00:01:54.750> into<00:01:55.290> place<00:01:55.530> on

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
into the tube it's bolted into place on

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.600 
into the tube it's bolted into place on
the<00:01:56.009> bottom<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.719> what<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.869> had<00:01:58.049> now<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:59.250> the

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
the bottom and what you had now is the

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.209 
the bottom and what you had now is the
same<00:01:59.820> thing<00:01:59.850> well<00:02:00.360> ah<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:00.810> that's<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.770> second

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
same thing well ah so that's the second

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.260 
same thing well ah so that's the second
thing<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.759> receive<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:04.130> struts

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
thing and receive this is struts

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.789 
thing and receive this is struts
inserted<00:02:06.270> into<00:02:06.509> already<00:02:07.079> fabricated

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
inserted into already fabricated

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.960 
inserted into already fabricated
housings<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:10.520> that<00:02:11.520> makes<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.760> lot<00:02:11.940> easier

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
housings and that makes a lot easier

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.610 
housings and that makes a lot easier
because<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.810> don't<00:02:12.989> have<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.200> do<00:02:13.349> all<00:02:13.379> the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
because you don't have to do all the

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.430 
because you don't have to do all the
fabric<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.580> cutting<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.690> drilling<00:02:15.959> and

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
fabric and cutting and drilling and

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.180 
fabric and cutting and drilling and

stepping<00:02:21.060> with<00:02:22.129> the<00:02:23.129> third<00:02:23.550> way<00:02:23.879> is<00:02:26.810> even<00:02:27.810> more

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.280 

assemble<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.830> that<00:02:31.950> is<00:02:32.099> the<00:02:32.550> full<00:02:32.819> strut<00:02:33.290> okay

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
assemble and that is the full strut okay

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:41.509 
assemble and that is the full strut okay
so<00:02:34.920> this<00:02:38.360> is<00:02:39.739> what<00:02:40.739> I<00:02:40.769> just<00:02:40.980> showed<00:02:41.069> you<00:02:41.250> all

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
so this is what I just showed you all

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.820 
so this is what I just showed you all
that<00:02:41.730> this<00:02:41.819> is<00:02:42.000> an<00:02:42.150> actual<00:02:42.590> installed<00:02:43.590> version

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
that this is an actual installed version

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.180 
that this is an actual installed version
you<00:02:44.129> can<00:02:44.250> see<00:02:44.489> at<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.700> bottom<00:02:44.879> there's<00:02:45.360> a<00:02:45.480> tort

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
you can see at the bottom there's a tort

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.420 
you can see at the bottom there's a tort
set<00:02:47.190> bolt<00:02:47.519> in<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.849> bottom<00:02:48.209> and<00:02:49.220> so<00:02:50.220> this<00:02:50.370> is

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
set bolt in the bottom and so this is

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.430 
set bolt in the bottom and so this is
number<00:02:50.670> two<00:02:51.000> number<00:02:51.690> three<00:02:51.870> is<00:02:52.080> where<00:02:52.290> we

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
number two number three is where we

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.500 
number two number three is where we
assemble<00:02:52.920> everything<00:02:53.190> for<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:54.330> number

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
you do all the Assembly of the springs

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.559 
you do all the Assembly of the springs
to<00:02:59.159> the<00:02:59.250> struts<00:02:59.550> yourself<00:02:59.940> number<00:03:00.120> three<00:03:00.450> is

over<00:04:43.710> strut<00:04:45.320> where<00:04:46.320> you<00:04:46.410> can<00:04:46.590> see<00:04:46.940> this<00:04:47.940> would

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
over strut where you can see this would

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.070 
over strut where you can see this would
slide<00:04:50.160> inside<00:04:50.580> there<00:04:50.880> and<00:04:51.180> actually<00:04:51.690> what<00:04:51.990> we

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
slide inside there and actually what we

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.620 
slide inside there and actually what we
do<00:04:52.230> is<00:04:52.350> we<00:04:52.500> have<00:04:52.620> a<00:04:52.650> machined<00:04:53.130> piece<00:04:53.630> because

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
do is we have a machined piece because

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.870 
do is we have a machined piece because
obviously<00:04:54.930> there's<00:04:55.560> nothing<00:04:55.980> to<00:04:56.070> mount<00:04:56.280> with

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
obviously there's nothing to mount with

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.530 
obviously there's nothing to mount with
on<00:04:57.090> the<00:04:57.180> bottom<00:04:57.510> this<00:04:58.470> is<00:04:59.000> we<00:05:00.000> have<00:05:00.090> to<00:05:00.240> weld

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
on the bottom this is we have to weld

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.540 
on the bottom this is we have to weld
this<00:05:00.840> here<00:05:01.350> and<00:05:01.620> then<00:05:03.410> there's<00:05:04.410> a<00:05:04.500> nut<00:05:04.770> that

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
this here and then there's a nut that

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.730 
this here and then there's a nut that
threads<00:05:06.360> onto<00:05:06.600> the<00:05:06.780> top<00:05:06.990> you<00:05:07.200> can<00:05:07.320> see<00:05:07.380> that's

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
threads onto the top you can see that's

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.920 
threads onto the top you can see that's
a<00:05:07.860> threaded<00:05:08.280> piece<00:05:08.550> so<00:05:09.180> act<00:05:09.360> like<00:05:09.450> you've<00:05:09.690> held

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
a threaded piece so act like you've held

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.260 
a threaded piece so act like you've held
them<00:05:10.080> from<00:05:10.290> the<00:05:10.410> top<00:05:10.650> and<00:05:11.120> what's<00:05:12.120> interesting

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
them from the top and what's interesting

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.010 
them from the top and what's interesting
about<00:05:12.660> the<00:05:12.930> setup<00:05:13.310> the<00:05:14.310> way<00:05:14.430> we<00:05:14.640> do<00:05:14.820> it<00:05:14.850> on<00:05:15.630> all

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
about the setup the way we do it on all

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.100 
about the setup the way we do it on all
of<00:05:16.140> ours<00:05:16.830> is<00:05:16.860> we<00:05:17.190> actually<00:05:17.340> have<00:05:17.850> a<00:05:18.240> separate

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
of ours is we actually have a separate

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.170 
of ours is we actually have a separate
piece<00:05:19.940> this<00:05:21.800> little<00:05:22.800> insert<00:05:23.220> slides<00:05:23.669> over<00:05:24.030> see

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
piece this little insert slides over see

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.460 
piece this little insert slides over see
that's<00:05:24.360> a<00:05:24.480> stainless<00:05:25.320> steel<00:05:25.350> insert<00:05:26.010> and<00:05:26.790> fits

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
that's a stainless steel insert and fits

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.050 
that's a stainless steel insert and fits
over<00:05:28.470> sleeve<00:05:28.919> really<00:05:29.280> nicely<00:05:29.490> this<00:05:29.820> is<00:05:29.970> the

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
over sleeve really nicely this is the

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.130 
over sleeve really nicely this is the
mace<00:05:30.680> 6061<00:05:31.680> anodized<00:05:32.190> aluminum<00:05:32.760> and<00:05:33.060> you<00:05:33.960> see

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
mace 6061 anodized aluminum and you see

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.710 
mace 6061 anodized aluminum and you see
how<00:05:34.230> that<00:05:34.380> fits<00:05:34.590> on<00:05:34.860> actually<00:05:35.850> that's<00:05:36.060> this<00:05:36.570> is

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
how that fits on actually that's this is

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.450 
how that fits on actually that's this is
a<00:05:36.750> little<00:05:37.050> bit<00:05:37.169> too<00:05:37.350> long<00:05:37.560> the<00:05:37.830> one<00:05:37.980> we<00:05:38.130> use<00:05:38.280> is

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
a little bit too long the one we use is

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.150 
a little bit too long the one we use is
shorter<00:05:38.880> and<00:05:39.300> actually<00:05:39.840> fits<00:05:40.110> exactly<00:05:40.620> right

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
shorter and actually fits exactly right

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.680 
shorter and actually fits exactly right
that<00:05:41.220> the<00:05:41.760> right<00:05:41.970> size<00:05:42.210> so<00:05:42.390> that's<00:05:42.570> the

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
that the right size so that's the

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:49.100 
that the right size so that's the
coilover<00:05:43.230> setup<00:05:43.560> that<00:05:43.740> we<00:05:43.770> use<00:05:47.750> this<00:05:48.750> is<00:05:48.960> the

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
coilover setup that we use this is the

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.409 
coilover setup that we use this is the
new<00:05:49.260> Honda<00:05:49.650> Fit<00:05:49.880> coilover<00:05:50.880> that<00:05:51.090> we're<00:05:51.270> doing

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
new Honda Fit coilover that we're doing

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:54.050 
new Honda Fit coilover that we're doing
and<00:05:52.080> we<00:05:52.860> have<00:05:52.950> to<00:05:53.070> make<00:05:53.190> more<00:05:53.640> of<00:05:53.729> this<00:05:53.850> because

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
and we have to make more of this because

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.310 
and we have to make more of this because
we've<00:05:54.270> already<00:05:54.450> subha<00:05:55.020> them<00:05:57.200> when<00:05:58.200> we're

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 
we've already subha them when we're

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.620 
we've already subha them when we're
point<00:05:58.680> of<00:05:58.919> confusion<00:05:59.729> for<00:06:00.210> a<00:06:00.270> lot<00:06:00.390> of<00:06:00.479> people

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:40.950 
lot of noise so make sure you do that

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:45.560

correctly<00:06:41.840> aftermarket<00:06:44.000> top<00:06:45.000> hats<00:06:45.270> that<00:06:45.450> we

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:45.570 
correctly aftermarket top hats that we

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.480 
correctly aftermarket top hats that we
use<00:06:45.750> don't<00:06:46.020> have<00:06:46.229> that<00:06:46.440> they're<00:06:46.680> universal

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490 
use don't have that they're universal

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.500 
use don't have that they're universal
and<00:06:47.669> a<00:06:47.700> lot<00:06:47.820> easier<00:06:48.030> to<00:06:48.300> use<00:06:48.510> and<00:06:49.490> I<00:06:50.510> think

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:51.510 
and a lot easier to use and I think

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.830 
and a lot easier to use and I think
that's<00:06:51.660> it<00:06:51.840> hopefully<00:06:52.530> that<00:06:52.710> explains<00:06:52.830> it

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 
that's it hopefully that explains it

that's it hopefully that explains it
