you

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.170 

for<00:01:06.620> this<00:01:06.740> project<00:01:07.100> I<00:01:07.400> probably<00:01:07.670> used<00:01:07.970> about

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
for this project I probably used about

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.870 
for this project I probably used about
14<00:01:08.630> yards<00:01:08.960> of<00:01:09.050> tulle<00:01:09.230> I<00:01:09.530> use<00:01:09.800> seven<00:01:10.220> yards<00:01:10.700> of

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
14 yards of tulle I use seven yards of

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.450 
14 yards of tulle I use seven yards of
just<00:01:11.120> matte<00:01:11.420> navy<00:01:11.900> blue<00:01:12.230> tulle<00:01:12.530> and<00:01:12.830> then<00:01:13.160> I

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
just matte navy blue tulle and then I

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.880 
just matte navy blue tulle and then I
used<00:01:13.850> another<00:01:14.000> seven<00:01:14.600> yards<00:01:14.930> or<00:01:15.050> so<00:01:15.200> sparkly

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
used another seven yards or so sparkly

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.510 
used another seven yards or so sparkly
navy<00:01:16.220> blue<00:01:16.520> tool<00:01:17.200> the<00:01:18.200> tool<00:01:18.470> measuring<00:01:19.370> in

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
navy blue tool the tool measuring in

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.940 
navy blue tool the tool measuring in
length<00:01:19.820> it's<00:01:20.090> four<00:01:20.450> feet<00:01:20.780> so<00:01:21.320> it's<00:01:21.500> folded<00:01:21.830> in

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
length it's four feet so it's folded in

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.500 
length it's four feet so it's folded in
half<00:01:22.100> right<00:01:22.340> now<00:01:22.370> so<00:01:22.790> it's<00:01:22.910> about<00:01:23.060> two<00:01:23.300> feet

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
half right now so it's about two feet

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.800 
half right now so it's about two feet
folded<00:01:23.990> in<00:01:24.110> half<00:01:25.150> what<00:01:26.150> you<00:01:26.270> see<00:01:26.480> me<00:01:26.600> doing

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
folded in half what you see me doing

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.960 
folded in half what you see me doing
here<00:01:26.930> is<00:01:27.380> just<00:01:27.410> simply<00:01:27.890> measuring<00:01:28.490> out<00:01:28.640> about

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
here is just simply measuring out about

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.120 
here is just simply measuring out about
four<00:01:29.300> inches<00:01:29.630> across<00:01:29.990> of<00:01:30.410> the<00:01:30.620> tulle<00:01:30.890> and

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
four inches across of the tulle and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.130 
four inches across of the tulle and
cutting<00:01:31.490> it<00:01:31.610> into<00:01:31.790> strips<00:01:32.210> if<00:01:32.420> you're<00:01:32.870> good<00:01:33.050> at

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
cutting it into strips if you're good at

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.690 
cutting it into strips if you're good at
eyeballing<00:01:33.290> it<00:01:33.830> you<00:01:33.950> don't<00:01:34.130> have<00:01:34.220> to<00:01:34.340> use<00:01:34.550> your

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
eyeballing it you don't have to use your

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.820 
eyeballing it you don't have to use your
ruler<00:01:35.000> every<00:01:35.270> time<00:01:35.480> but<00:01:35.720> I<00:01:35.810> just<00:01:35.840> use<00:01:36.320> mine<00:01:36.620> as

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
ruler every time but I just use mine as

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.300 
ruler every time but I just use mine as
a<00:01:36.860> guide<00:01:37.160> as<00:01:37.520> I<00:01:37.730> cut<00:01:38.360> my<00:01:38.600> strips<00:01:38.960> of<00:01:39.110> tulle<00:01:39.320> so

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
a guide as I cut my strips of tulle so

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.760 
a guide as I cut my strips of tulle so
again<00:01:40.640> just<00:01:40.970> to<00:01:41.090> be<00:01:41.120> clear<00:01:41.570> I<00:01:41.630> used<00:01:42.020> about<00:01:42.170> 14

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
again just to be clear I used about 14

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.890 
again just to be clear I used about 14
yards<00:01:43.130> of<00:01:43.250> tulle<00:01:43.460> now<00:01:43.910> you<00:01:43.970> don't<00:01:44.330> have<00:01:44.510> to<00:01:44.570> use

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
yards of tulle now you don't have to use

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.690 
yards of tulle now you don't have to use
this<00:01:45.110> much<00:01:45.380> tool<00:01:45.650> for<00:01:45.890> your<00:01:45.980> project<00:01:46.550> I

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
this much tool for your project I

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.580 
this much tool for your project I
personally<00:01:47.300> wanted<00:01:47.540> a<00:01:47.660> really<00:01:47.900> full<00:01:48.200> skirt

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
personally wanted a really full skirt

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.730 
personally wanted a really full skirt
and<00:01:48.860> when<00:01:49.670> I<00:01:49.700> loop<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.720> tulle<00:01:51.230> strips<00:01:51.560> onto

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
and when I loop the tulle strips onto

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.070 
and when I loop the tulle strips onto
the<00:01:51.950> belt<00:01:52.160> I<00:01:52.340> didn't<00:01:52.820> spread<00:01:53.180> them<00:01:53.360> out<00:01:53.570> very

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
the belt I didn't spread them out very

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.290 
the belt I didn't spread them out very
much<00:01:54.290> they<00:01:54.830> were<00:01:54.890> very<00:01:55.250> close<00:01:55.820> together<00:01:56.030> and

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
much they were very close together and

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.120 
much they were very close together and
tight<00:01:56.690> so<00:01:56.720> that's<00:01:57.170> one<00:01:57.440> of<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.620> reason<00:01:57.950> why<00:01:57.980> I

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
tight so that's one of the reason why I

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.420 
tight so that's one of the reason why I
use<00:01:58.280> so<00:01:58.730> much<00:01:58.880> tulle<00:01:59.770> now<00:02:00.770> this<00:02:00.980> is<00:02:01.130> where<00:02:01.310> the

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430

just go ahead and take the tool strip
going<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:06.860> create<00:02:07.160> a<00:02:07.220> loop<00:02:07.460> and<00:02:08.330> we<00:02:08.390> create

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
going to create a loop and we create

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.270 
going to create a loop and we create
that<00:02:09.110> loop<00:02:09.380> we're<00:02:09.649> just<00:02:09.800> going<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:09.980> put<00:02:10.250> that

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.910 
loop behind the belt then you will take
the<00:02:14.239> two<00:02:14.450> legs<00:02:14.780> of<00:02:15.020> that<00:02:15.320> strip<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:15.830> are

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
the two legs of that strip that are

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.680 
the two legs of that strip that are
remaining<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.670> simply<00:02:17.120> pull<00:02:17.420> them<00:02:17.660> through

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
remaining and simply pull them through

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.580 
remaining and simply pull them through
and<00:02:18.170> secure<00:02:19.150> now<00:02:20.150> for<00:02:20.420> my<00:02:20.540> skirt<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:21.020> had<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.380> run

and secure now for my skirt I had to run
back<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.070> fabric<00:02:22.610> store<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:22.880> couple<00:02:23.150> of

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
back to the fabric store a couple of

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.570 
back to the fabric store a couple of
times<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:24.320> fabric<00:02:24.680> suits<00:02:24.890> that<00:02:24.980> I<00:02:25.130> was<00:02:25.280> going

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
times the fabric suits that I was going

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.520 
times the fabric suits that I was going
to<00:02:25.730> actually<00:02:25.970> run<00:02:26.360> out<00:02:26.660> of<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:26.959> color<00:02:27.200> tool

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
to actually run out of the color tool

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.800 
to actually run out of the color tool
that<00:02:27.739> I<00:02:27.830> was<00:02:27.920> using<00:02:28.160> so<00:02:28.760> I<00:02:28.820> decided<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.330> use<00:02:29.450> the

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
that I was using so I decided to use the

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.080 
that I was using so I decided to use the
matte<00:02:30.110> navy<00:02:30.470> blue<00:02:30.770> tulle<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.610> sparkly
