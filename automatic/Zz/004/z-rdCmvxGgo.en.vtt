movement of that push rod the way to
correctly<00:00:41.460> adjust<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:42.239> hydraulic<00:00:42.780> lifter<00:00:43.140> is

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
correctly adjust a hydraulic lifter is

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.220 
correctly adjust a hydraulic lifter is
we<00:00:43.350> have<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.649> get<00:00:43.829> rid<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.700> lash<00:00:45.230> this

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
we have to get rid of this lash this

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.010 
we have to get rid of this lash this
slop<00:00:46.980> or<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.370> play<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.879> here<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.510> has<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.870> go

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
slop or this play in here that has to go

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.100 
slop or this play in here that has to go
away<00:00:49.670> so<00:00:50.670> what<00:00:50.820> we're<00:00:51.000> going<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.149> do<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.750> we're

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
away so what we're going to do is we're

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.299 
away so what we're going to do is we're
going<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.260> take<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.829> we're<00:00:53.039> going<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.190> adjust

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
going to take and we're going to adjust

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.139 
going to take and we're going to adjust
that<00:00:53.899> so<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.199> lash<00:00:55.410> disappears<00:00:56.399> once

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
that so that the lash disappears once

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.299 
that so that the lash disappears once
the<00:00:57.329> lash<00:00:57.539> disappears<00:00:58.320> then<00:00:59.070> we're<00:00:59.160> going<00:00:59.280> to

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
the lash disappears then we're going to

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.520 
the lash disappears then we're going to
go<00:00:59.489> down<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> little<00:00:59.879> further<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.320> case

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
go down a little further in this case

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.549 
go down a little further in this case
we're<00:01:01.710> going<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.859> go<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.070> quarter<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.699> turn

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
we're going to go a quarter of a turn

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.050 
we're going to go a quarter of a turn
some<00:01:04.559> engines<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.070> got<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.309> go<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> half<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.850> turn

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
some engines you got to go a half a turn

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.880 
some engines you got to go a half a turn
or<00:01:06.360> three<00:01:06.600> quarters<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.049> just<00:01:07.229> depends<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.740> the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
or three quarters it just depends on the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.920 
or three quarters it just depends on the
specs<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.970> manufacturer<00:01:09.659> but<00:01:09.780> we're

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
specs of the manufacturer but we're

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.090 
specs of the manufacturer but we're
going<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.110> go<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> quarter<00:01:10.619> turn<00:01:10.830> because

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
going to go a quarter turn because

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.100 
going to go a quarter turn because
that's<00:01:11.220> what<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.400> like<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.670> adjust<00:01:12.119> these<00:01:12.299> so

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
that's what I like to adjust these so

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.080 
that's what I like to adjust these so
we've<00:01:13.260> got<00:01:13.409> an<00:01:13.560> adjuster<00:01:14.100> here<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.549> adjuster

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
we've got an adjuster here this adjuster

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.749 
we've got an adjuster here this adjuster
has<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.810> lock<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:17.210> lock<00:01:18.210> bolt<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.710> may<00:01:19.920> be

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
has a lock a lock bolt on it you may be

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.510 
has a lock a lock bolt on it you may be
using<00:01:21.060> just<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.930> regular<00:01:22.380> rocker<00:01:22.680> nut<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.310> is

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
using just a regular rocker nut that is

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.600 
using just a regular rocker nut that is
self<00:01:23.850> locking<00:01:24.210> either<00:01:25.140> way<00:01:25.470> there<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.070> always

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
self locking either way there is always

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.760 
self locking either way there is always
a<00:01:26.640> way<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.880> lock<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.420> into<00:01:27.689> place<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.650> what

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
a way to lock that into place so what

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.469 
a way to lock that into place so what
we're<00:01:28.920> going<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.070> do<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.640> we're<00:01:30.119> going<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.270> run

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
we're going to do is we're going to run

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.260 
we're going to do is we're going to run
this<00:01:30.689> down<00:01:31.460> until<00:01:32.460> we<00:01:32.549> get<00:01:32.670> rid<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.060> lash

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
this down until we get rid of the lash

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.749 
this down until we get rid of the lash
so<00:01:34.250> we've<00:01:35.250> got<00:01:35.549> we've<00:01:36.119> got<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.600> lash<00:01:36.960> here

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
so we've got we've got this lash here

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.340 
so we've got we've got this lash here
you<00:01:38.759> can<00:01:38.909> see<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.479> thing<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.140> moving

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
you can see that that thing is moving

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.770 
you can see that that thing is moving
like<00:01:40.680> crazy<00:01:41.090> so<00:01:42.090> we're<00:01:42.210> just<00:01:42.240> going<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.540> run

like crazy so we're just going to run

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.399 
like crazy so we're just going to run
this<00:01:42.990> down<00:01:43.340> until<00:01:44.340> we<00:01:44.460> get<00:01:44.579> rid<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.409> and

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
this down until we get rid of that and

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.410 
this down until we get rid of that and
it's<00:01:46.950> actually<00:01:47.369> pretty<00:01:47.700> easy<00:01:47.939> with<00:01:48.210> this

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
it's actually pretty easy with this

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.380 
it's actually pretty easy with this
style<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:49.460> hold<00:01:50.460> down<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.880> get<00:01:51.000> rid<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.210> that

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
style of hold down to get rid of that

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.770 
style of hold down to get rid of that
lash

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.520 

a<00:01:54.840> little<00:01:55.590> bit<00:01:55.770> more<00:01:56.900> now<00:01:57.900> we<00:01:57.960> have<00:01:58.260> just

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530

laughs but we still have to go a quarter

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.830 
laughs but we still have to go a quarter
of<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.680> turn<00:02:05.000> so<00:02:06.000> we're<00:02:06.150> actually<00:02:06.270> going<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.630> go

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
of a turn so we're actually going to go

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.330 
of a turn so we're actually going to go
one<00:02:07.830> quarter<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.429> turn<00:02:09.110> now<00:02:10.110> we<00:02:10.679> are<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.130> the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
one quarter of a turn now we are in the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.820 
one quarter of a turn now we are in the
plunger<00:02:11.850> of<00:02:12.000> our<00:02:12.120> lifter<00:02:12.540> we<00:02:13.140> don't<00:02:13.350> have<00:02:13.590> any

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
plunger of our lifter we don't have any

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.970 
plunger of our lifter we don't have any
last<00:02:14.220> year<00:02:14.580> if<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:14.790> grab<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.270> push<00:02:15.540> rod<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:16.170> have

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
last year if I grab this push rod I have

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.770 
last year if I grab this push rod I have
no<00:02:17.340> movement<00:02:17.640> whatsoever<00:02:19.010> but<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.040> can<00:02:20.780> see

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
no movement whatsoever but I can see

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.630 
no movement whatsoever but I can see
that<00:02:21.959> my<00:02:22.140> plunger<00:02:22.500> in<00:02:22.830> my<00:02:22.950> push<00:02:23.220> rod<00:02:23.489> is

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
that my plunger in my push rod is

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.420 
that my plunger in my push rod is
actually<00:02:24.410> moving<00:02:25.410> so<00:02:25.650> I'm<00:02:25.770> in<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:25.980> travel<00:02:26.400> of

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
actually moving so I'm in the travel of

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.460 
actually moving so I'm in the travel of
that<00:02:26.610> plunger<00:02:27.269> then<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.170> simply<00:02:28.530> put<00:02:28.920> my<00:02:30.470> take

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
that plunger then I simply put my take

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.540 
that plunger then I simply put my take
my<00:02:31.680> lock<00:02:31.980> nut<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.550> I<00:02:32.940> lock<00:02:33.239> it<00:02:33.420> into<00:02:33.570> place<00:02:34.550> and

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
my lock nut and I lock it into place and

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.170 
my lock nut and I lock it into place and
once<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.850> lock<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.360> into<00:02:36.570> place<00:02:37.940> that<00:02:38.940> rocker

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
once I lock that into place that rocker

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.110 
once I lock that into place that rocker
