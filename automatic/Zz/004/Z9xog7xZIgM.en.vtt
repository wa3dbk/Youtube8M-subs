the question so what makes the g502
proteus<00:00:20.480> gaming<00:00:21.480> mouse<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:22.320> different<00:00:22.920> from

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
proteus gaming mouse so different from

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.730 
proteus gaming mouse so different from
everything<00:00:23.430> else<00:00:23.699> in<00:00:24.000> this<00:00:24.269> big<00:00:24.539> world<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.230> PC

everything else in this big world of PC

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.710 
everything else in this big world of PC
gaming<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.220> well<00:00:26.490> my<00:00:26.789> answer<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.359> would

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
gaming and well my answer to that would

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.810 
gaming and well my answer to that would
be<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:28.470> there's<00:00:28.740> not<00:00:28.859> really<00:00:28.980> one<00:00:29.429> single

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
be that there's not really one single

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.820 
be that there's not really one single
feature<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.390> makes<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:31.050> Mouse<00:00:31.320> really

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
feature that makes this Mouse really

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.680 
feature that makes this Mouse really
anything<00:00:32.160> different<00:00:32.730> if<00:00:32.910> anything<00:00:33.480> it's

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
anything different if anything it's

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.600 
anything different if anything it's
really<00:00:33.780> all<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.410> combination<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.219> features

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
really all the combination of features

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.180 
really all the combination of features
that<00:00:36.059> makes<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:36.600> Mouse<00:00:36.930> possibly<00:00:37.920> something

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
that makes this Mouse possibly something

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.549 
that makes this Mouse possibly something
worthy<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:39.210> put<00:00:39.450> on<00:00:39.600> your<00:00:39.870> computer<00:00:40.050> desk

firstly<00:00:41.280> let's<00:00:41.550> talk<00:00:41.760> about<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.180> sensor

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
firstly let's talk about the sensor

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.630 
firstly let's talk about the sensor
Logitech<00:00:43.320> claims<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.070> one<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
Logitech claims that it is one of the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.240 
Logitech claims that it is one of the
most<00:00:44.850> accurate<00:00:45.149> sensors<00:00:45.870> on<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.530> market<00:00:46.890> now

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
most accurate sensors on the market now

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.950 
most accurate sensors on the market now
I<00:00:47.280> personally<00:00:47.910> haven't<00:00:48.090> tested<00:00:48.360> out<00:00:48.719> all<00:00:48.899> of

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
I personally haven't tested out all of

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.110 
I personally haven't tested out all of
the<00:00:49.440> mice<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.070> market<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.550> confirm<00:00:50.940> that

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
the mice in the market to confirm that

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.479 
the mice in the market to confirm that
claim<00:00:51.449> but<00:00:51.780> what<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:51.989> can<00:00:52.350> confirm<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:53.039> that

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
claim but what I can confirm is that

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.360 
claim but what I can confirm is that
with<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.820> capability<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.570> do<00:00:54.890> 12,000<00:00:55.890> dots

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
with the capability to do 12,000 dots

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.569 
with the capability to do 12,000 dots
per<00:00:56.670> inch<00:00:56.699> makes<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.480> g502<00:00:58.199> one<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.250> most

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
per inch makes the g502 one of the most

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.340 
per inch makes the g502 one of the most
sensitive<00:01:00.000> Mouse<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.989> you're<00:01:01.170> going<00:01:01.320> to

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
sensitive Mouse that you're going to

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.830 
sensitive Mouse that you're going to
come<00:01:01.620> across<00:01:01.739> now<00:01:02.550> having<00:01:02.879> ultra<00:01:03.210> high<00:01:03.420> DPI

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
come across now having ultra high DPI

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.410 
come across now having ultra high DPI
settings<00:01:04.159> doesn't<00:01:05.159> make<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.610> Mouse<00:01:05.909> ultra

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
settings doesn't make this Mouse ultra

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.660 
settings doesn't make this Mouse ultra
precise<00:01:06.840> or<00:01:07.140> even<00:01:07.500> usable<00:01:07.860> for<00:01:08.159> some<00:01:08.310> people

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
precise or even usable for some people

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.580 
precise or even usable for some people
but<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.180> believe<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.810> may<00:01:10.049> be<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.409> key

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
but I believe that may be the key

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.679 
but I believe that may be the key
argument<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.850> fact<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.299> some

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
argument and the fact is that some

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.719 
argument and the fact is that some
people<00:01:12.720> who<00:01:13.170> are<00:01:13.200> interested<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:13.979> getting<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
people who are interested in getting the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.149 
people who are interested in getting the
highest<00:01:14.939> possible<00:01:15.509> dpi<00:01:15.869> settings<00:01:16.350> are<00:01:16.530> going

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
highest possible dpi settings are going

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.460 
highest possible dpi settings are going
to<00:01:17.340> possibly<00:01:17.850> love<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.450> thing<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.869> personally

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
to possibly love this thing I personally

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.469 
to possibly love this thing I personally
think<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.740> now<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> time<00:01:20.909> more<00:01:21.150> than<00:01:21.180> ever

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
think that now is a time more than ever

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.289 
think that now is a time more than ever
