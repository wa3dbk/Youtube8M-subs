of<00:02:35.010> expectations<00:02:35.640> on<00:02:35.730> them<00:02:35.880> as<00:02:36.000> well<00:02:36.180> they've

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
of expectations on them as well they've

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.840 
of expectations on them as well they've
added<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.230> very<00:02:37.650> innovative<00:02:37.980> new<00:02:38.340> concept

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
added a very innovative new concept

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.880 
added a very innovative new concept
called<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.090> passing<00:02:39.630> cone<00:02:39.900> where<00:02:40.680> it

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
called the passing cone where it

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.650 
called the passing cone where it
represents<00:02:41.460> for<00:02:41.610> example<00:02:41.940> Peyton<00:02:42.240> Manning's

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
represents for example Peyton Manning's

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.730 
represents for example Peyton Manning's
ability<00:02:43.050> to<00:02:43.140> see<00:02:43.290> more<00:02:43.470> or<00:02:43.530> less<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.710> whole

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
ability to see more or less the whole

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.130 
ability to see more or less the whole
field<00:02:44.070> at<00:02:44.220> once<00:02:44.430> whereas<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.090> rookie<00:02:45.630> like<00:02:45.780> Alex

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
field at once whereas a rookie like Alex

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.200 
field at once whereas a rookie like Alex
Smith<00:02:46.320> probably<00:02:46.560> won't<00:02:47.100> your<00:02:47.850> player<00:02:48.180> will

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
Smith probably won't your player will

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.360 
Smith probably won't your player will
use<00:02:48.690> this<00:02:49.200> passing<00:02:49.680> cone<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.130> they'll<00:02:50.250> have

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
use this passing cone and they'll have

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.160 
use this passing cone and they'll have
better<00:02:50.460> luck<00:02:50.670> completing<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.150> pass<00:02:51.330> if<00:02:51.690> the

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
better luck completing a pass if the

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.930 
better luck completing a pass if the
receiver<00:02:52.800> is<00:02:52.950> in<00:02:52.980> their<00:02:53.190> field<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.520> vision<00:02:53.700> if

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
receiver is in their field of vision if

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.250 
receiver is in their field of vision if
you<00:02:54.030> try<00:02:54.210> to<00:02:54.270> throw<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.540> ball<00:02:54.630> out<00:02:54.960> of<00:02:54.990> the

quarterbacks field of vision

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.790 
quarterbacks field of vision
you're<00:02:57.330> going<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.510> see<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:57.840> more<00:02:58.320> likely<00:02:58.560> chance

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
you're going to see a more likely chance

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.980 
you're going to see a more likely chance
of<00:02:58.920> interception<00:02:59.520> a<00:02:59.640> bad<00:02:59.820> pass<00:03:00.090> something<00:03:00.780> to

that effect so adding that and another

the license that's going to help you

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.520 
the license that's going to help you
sell<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:12.090> game<00:04:12.240> then<00:04:12.840> go<00:04:13.170> completely

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
sell the game then go completely

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.409 
distinctive from any other title and I
think<00:04:17.370> they're<00:04:17.460> trying<00:04:17.580> to<00:04:17.729> do<00:04:17.910> that<00:04:17.940> there's

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
think they're trying to do that there's

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.120 
think they're trying to do that there's
still<00:04:18.570> a<00:04:18.600> ways<00:04:18.780> off<00:04:18.930> from<00:04:18.989> from<00:04:19.500> release<00:04:19.739> but

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
still a ways off from from release but

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
still a ways off from from release but
again<00:04:20.940> that

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
again that

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.370 
again that
something<00:04:21.449> that<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:21.630> got<00:04:21.870> a<00:04:21.900> chance<00:04:22.109> to<00:04:22.229> sit

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
rather promising a very different

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.930 
rather promising a very different

of people rather put themselves in or
their<00:06:07.530> friends<00:06:07.919> as<00:06:08.190> well<00:06:08.430> so<00:06:08.699> give<00:06:08.820> you<00:06:08.909> some

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
their friends as well so give you some

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.300 
their friends as well so give you some
flexibility<00:06:09.630> but<00:06:10.110> realistically<00:06:10.740> the<00:06:10.830> NFL<00:06:11.190> is

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
flexibility but realistically the NFL is

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.890 
flexibility but realistically the NFL is
a<00:06:11.340> more<00:06:11.520> popular<00:06:11.940> sport<00:06:12.210> than<00:06:12.360> NC<00:06:12.599> double-a

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
a more popular sport than NC double-a

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:13.700 
a more popular sport than NC double-a
and<00:06:12.930> I<00:06:13.050> think<00:06:13.229> that's<00:06:13.380> likely<00:06:13.530> to<00:06:13.620> be

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710 
and I think that's likely to be

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.290 
and I think that's likely to be
reflected<00:06:14.250> in<00:06:14.340> the<00:06:14.430> games<00:06:14.639> but<00:06:14.909> there's

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
reflected in the games but there's

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.570 
reflected in the games but there's
certainly<00:06:15.570> room<00:06:15.630> and<00:06:16.280> Electronic<00:06:17.280> Arts<00:06:17.370> has

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
certainly room and Electronic Arts has

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.159 
certainly room and Electronic Arts has
realized<00:06:17.970> that<00:06:18.060> for<00:06:18.389> success<00:06:18.990> with<00:06:19.139> both

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:19.169 
realized that for success with both

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:20.719 
realized that for success with both
titles<00:06:19.680> and<00:06:19.830> they're<00:06:19.919> they're<00:06:20.099> very<00:06:20.280> big<00:06:20.490> into

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
titles and they're they're very big into

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:22.850 
titles and they're they're very big into
