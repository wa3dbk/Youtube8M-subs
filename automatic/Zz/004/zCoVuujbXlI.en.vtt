00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
where we can play with the hottest and

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.630 
where we can play with the hottest and
fastest<00:00:15.389> diecast<00:00:16.080> cars<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.740> in<00:00:17.279> this<00:00:17.460> video

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
fastest diecast cars and in this video

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.269 
fastest diecast cars and in this video
we're<00:00:17.939> going<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.240> use<00:00:18.529> pieces<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.680> tracks<00:00:19.980> and

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
we're going to use pieces of tracks and

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.380 
we're going to use pieces of tracks and
we're<00:00:20.670> gonna<00:00:21.029> make<00:00:21.330> different<00:00:21.960> layouts<00:00:22.320> and

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
we're gonna make different layouts and

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.300 
we're gonna make different layouts and
the<00:00:24.390> tracks<00:00:24.720> are<00:00:24.990> from<00:00:25.380> track<00:00:26.130> sets<00:00:26.430> like<00:00:28.310> Mega

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
the tracks are from track sets like Mega

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.450 
the tracks are from track sets like Mega
Jump<00:00:29.660> tracks<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.920> all<00:00:33.530> the<00:00:34.530> copper<00:00:34.890> cave<00:00:35.190> and

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
Jump tracks it all the copper cave and

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.400 
Jump tracks it all the copper cave and
others<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.570> course<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:38.629> don't<00:00:39.629> have<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.809> booster

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
others of course I don't have a booster

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.490 
others of course I don't have a booster
so<00:00:41.040> I'm<00:00:41.519> trying<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.879> combine<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.570> tracks<00:00:42.870> to

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
so I'm trying to combine the tracks to

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.899 
so I'm trying to combine the tracks to
make<00:00:43.580> different<00:00:44.580> fun<00:00:45.210> layout<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.860> we<00:00:47.820> are

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:47.909 
make different fun layout and we are

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:50.229 
make different fun layout and we are
going<00:00:48.150> to<00:00:48.299> use<00:00:48.449> cars<00:00:48.780> like<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.500> Batmobile

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
going to use cars like the Batmobile

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.570 
going to use cars like the Batmobile

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
about this if you enjoy these playing

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.930 
about this if you enjoy these playing
with<00:01:06.840> Hot<00:01:07.020> Wheels<00:01:07.049> videos<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.920> maybe<00:01:08.580> we<00:01:08.790> can

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
with Hot Wheels videos and maybe we can

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.510 
with Hot Wheels videos and maybe we can
make<00:01:09.150> more<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.780> hopefully<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:10.950> future<00:01:11.040> I

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
make more and hopefully in the future I

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.630 
make more and hopefully in the future I
can<00:01:11.940> find<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.330> booster<00:01:12.780> somewhere<00:01:13.289> to<00:01:14.009> buy<00:01:14.219> so

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
can find a booster somewhere to buy so

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.389 
can find a booster somewhere to buy so
we<00:01:15.090> can<00:01:15.270> play<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.899> make<00:01:16.200> different<00:01:16.590> fondles

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
we can play and make different fondles

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.300 
we can play and make different fondles
this<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.329> first<00:01:18.570> layout<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.170> we<00:01:19.859> made<00:01:20.100> a

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
this is the first layout and we made a

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.240 
this is the first layout and we made a
circle<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.180> course<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.320> tracks<00:01:22.590> are<00:01:22.890> too

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
circle of course the tracks are too

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.630 
circle of course the tracks are too
straight<00:01:23.609> they<00:01:24.119> were<00:01:24.179> practical<00:01:24.859> so<00:01:25.859> I'm<00:01:26.429> not

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
straight they were practical so I'm not

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.950 
straight they were practical so I'm not
sure<00:01:26.850> if<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.149> cars<00:01:27.359> are<00:01:27.539> going<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.750> stay<00:01:27.929> on

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
sure if the cars are going to stay on

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.020 
sure if the cars are going to stay on
the<00:01:28.170> tracks<00:01:28.439> too<00:01:28.649> much<00:01:28.859> but<00:01:29.310> let's<00:01:29.640> give<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:29.880> a

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
the tracks too much but let's give it a

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.469 
the tracks too much but let's give it a
try

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
try

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:55.810 
try
first<00:01:31.409> one<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:33.090> Batmobile

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:04:08.060 

this<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:56.970> a<00:01:57.000> heavy<00:01:57.300> car<00:01:57.920> so<00:01:58.920> it's<00:01:59.190> not

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:23.930 

and<00:04:09.070> the<00:04:09.370> last<00:04:09.550> one<00:04:09.840> is<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:11.110> marker<00:04:11.530> voice<00:04:12.000> 11

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.400 

this<00:04:24.940> is<00:04:25.000> the<00:04:25.120> first<00:04:25.450> layer<00:04:25.630> I<00:04:25.960> think<00:04:26.320> is

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
this is the first layer I think is

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.300 
this is the first layer I think is
pretty<00:04:26.620> fun<00:04:26.980> to<00:04:27.340> pet<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:27.730> cars<00:04:28.680> control<00:04:29.680> very

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
pretty fun to pet the cars control very

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.490 
pretty fun to pet the cars control very
much<00:04:30.580> because<00:04:31.390> of<00:04:31.540> the<00:04:31.660> track<00:04:31.930> layout<00:04:32.200> of

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
much because of the track layout of

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.280 
much because of the track layout of
course<00:04:33.420> let<00:04:34.420> me<00:04:34.450> know<00:04:34.600> what<00:04:34.870> you<00:04:34.990> think<00:04:35.140> about
