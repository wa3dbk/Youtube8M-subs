00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
for me you know now that the color is

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.220 
for me you know now that the color is
coming<00:03:34.750> in<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:36.010> kind<00:03:36.460> of<00:03:36.490> rock<00:03:36.760> man<00:03:37.090> guy<00:03:37.390> the

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
coming in the kind of rock man guy the

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.380 
coming in the kind of rock man guy the
head<00:03:38.440> noticed<00:03:38.890> before<00:03:39.100> when<00:03:39.940> you<00:03:40.030> just<00:03:40.240> have

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
head noticed before when you just have

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.940 
head noticed before when you just have
the<00:03:40.510> linear<00:03:40.870> and<00:03:41.080> that<00:03:41.200> was<00:03:41.350> always<00:03:41.680> there

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
the linear and that was always there

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.370 
the linear and that was always there
right<00:03:42.220> yeah<00:03:42.490> it<00:03:42.880> was<00:03:43.270> always<00:03:43.420> there<00:03:43.780> yeah<00:03:44.140> I

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
right yeah it was always there yeah I

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.800 
right yeah it was always there yeah I
just<00:03:44.590> had<00:03:44.740> this<00:03:44.950> vision<00:03:45.730> of<00:03:46.030> it<00:03:46.210> being<00:03:46.510> like

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
just had this vision of it being like

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.910 
just had this vision of it being like
this<00:03:47.110> yeah<00:03:47.800> I<00:03:48.330> got<00:03:49.330> him<00:03:49.420> to<00:03:49.660> be<00:03:50.110> comfortable<00:03:50.290> I

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
this yeah I got him to be comfortable I

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.020 
this yeah I got him to be comfortable I
think

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
think

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.350 
think
color<00:03:54.190> value<00:03:55.190> you<00:03:55.340> mean<00:03:55.550> based<00:03:55.940> because<00:03:56.180> it's

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
color value you mean based because it's

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.870 
color value you mean based because it's
more<00:03:56.630> amount<00:03:56.900> of<00:03:57.050> chromatic<00:03:57.410> right<00:03:57.830> and<00:03:58.100> so

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
more amount of chromatic right and so

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.320 
more amount of chromatic right and so
maybe<00:03:59.090> another<00:03:59.360> 12<00:04:00.400> accentuates<00:04:01.400> some<00:04:02.150> of<00:04:02.240> the

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
maybe another 12 accentuates some of the

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.510 
maybe another 12 accentuates some of the
plane<00:04:02.770> differentiation<00:04:03.770> I<00:04:03.920> think<00:04:04.190> graphs

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
plane differentiation I think graphs

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.510 
plane differentiation I think graphs
yeah<00:04:04.940> but<00:04:05.930> and<00:04:06.440> also<00:04:06.830> thinking<00:04:07.160> about<00:04:07.190> the<00:04:07.340> I

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
yeah but and also thinking about the I

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.390 
yeah but and also thinking about the I
you<00:04:08.000> know<00:04:08.120> what<00:04:08.330> will<00:04:08.690> that<00:04:08.720> be<00:04:09.220> right<00:04:10.220> now

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
you know what will that be right now

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.030 
you know what will that be right now
it's<00:04:10.610> white<00:04:10.970> this<00:04:11.420> time<00:04:11.660> and<00:04:12.560> I<00:04:12.650> think<00:04:12.739> that

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
it's white this time and I think that

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.620 
it's white this time and I think that
might<00:04:13.190> be<00:04:13.250> a<00:04:13.370> little<00:04:13.489> bit<00:04:13.640> too<00:04:13.850> dramatic

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
might be a little bit too dramatic

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.220 
might be a little bit too dramatic
perhaps<00:04:15.170> you<00:04:16.070> might<00:04:16.250> want<00:04:16.549> to<00:04:16.639> find<00:04:16.820> some<00:04:17.230> you

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
perhaps you might want to find some you

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.340 
perhaps you might want to find some you
know<00:04:18.260> maybe<00:04:18.530> a<00:04:19.299> red<00:04:20.299> or<00:04:20.329> something<00:04:21.019> might<00:04:21.320> be

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
know maybe a red or something might be

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.909 
know maybe a red or something might be
good<00:04:21.950> because<00:04:22.389> you<00:04:23.389> don't<00:04:23.600> have<00:04:23.770> you<00:04:24.770> have

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
good because you don't have you have

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.530 
good because you don't have you have
this<00:04:25.240> central<00:04:26.240> you<00:04:26.630> know<00:04:26.720> giant<00:04:27.320> head
