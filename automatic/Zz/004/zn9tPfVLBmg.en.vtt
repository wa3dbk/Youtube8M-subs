from<00:00:21.270> scrap<00:00:21.660> parts<00:00:22.010> now<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.039> have<00:00:23.460> pretty<00:00:23.910> much

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
from scrap parts now I have pretty much

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.640 
from scrap parts now I have pretty much
everything<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.840> need<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.199> build<00:00:25.380> it

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
everything that I need to build it

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.740 
everything that I need to build it
there's<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.460> few<00:00:26.670> parts<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:27.119> don't<00:00:27.359> have<00:00:27.539> yet

because there's still my other RCS but
as<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.640> upgrade<00:00:30.150> those<00:00:30.420> are<00:00:30.630> C's<00:00:30.929> those<00:00:31.830> parts

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
as I upgrade those are C's those parts

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.530 
as I upgrade those are C's those parts
will<00:00:32.250> become<00:00:32.460> available<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.940> put<00:00:33.210> into<00:00:33.450> the

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
slash there's a few things I'm gonna

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.549 
slash there's a few things I'm gonna
have<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.300> buy<00:00:36.450> on<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.630> side<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.200> clean<00:00:37.350> the

chassis the receiver box the front and
rear<00:00:39.899> bumpers<00:00:40.379> but<00:00:40.710> once<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.430> find<00:00:41.670> those<00:00:41.820> for<00:00:42.059> a

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
rear bumpers but once I find those for a

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.240 
rear bumpers but once I find those for a
good<00:00:42.270> low<00:00:42.390> price<00:00:42.719> then<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.530> will<00:00:43.710> obtain<00:00:43.860> them

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
good low price then I will obtain them

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.549 
good low price then I will obtain them
other<00:00:44.940> than<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.600> gonna<00:00:45.840> be<00:00:45.930> a

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
other than that this is gonna be a

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.889 
other than that this is gonna be a
fairly<00:00:47.360> slow<00:00:48.360> build<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.820> no<00:00:50.820> more<00:00:51.000> delays<00:00:51.360> it's

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
fairly slow build so no more delays it's

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.100 
fairly slow build so no more delays it's
time<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.530> get<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.829> thing<00:00:52.890> started<00:00:54.110> first

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
time to get this thing started first

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.479 
time to get this thing started first
thing<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.440> I'm<00:00:55.500> gonna<00:00:55.680> put<00:00:55.860> together<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.460> a

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
thing that I'm gonna put together is a

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.220 
thing that I'm gonna put together is a
differential<00:00:57.210> gear<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.750> can<00:00:57.780> see<00:00:58.079> this

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
differential gear and you can see this

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.020 
differential gear and you can see this
is<00:00:58.379> not<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.710> metal<00:00:58.859> one<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.699> excel

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
is not the metal one that is the excel

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.790 
is not the metal one that is the excel
ready<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.420> fact<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.079> old<00:01:01.230> plastic

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
ready in fact this is the old plastic

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.070 
ready in fact this is the old plastic
one<00:01:02.010> but<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.670> really<00:01:02.699> don't<00:01:03.030> mind<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.840> was

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
one but I really don't mind this was

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.260 
one but I really don't mind this was
also<00:01:04.290> donated<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.040> me<00:01:05.129> by<00:01:05.339> trucks<00:01:05.670> as<00:01:05.850> RC

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
also donated to me by trucks as RC

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.020 
also donated to me by trucks as RC
upgrades<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:07.439> was<00:01:07.560> originally<00:01:08.130> meant<00:01:08.369> for<00:01:08.549> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
upgrades it was originally meant for the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.760 
upgrades it was originally meant for the
Traxxas<00:01:09.450> bandit<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.960> was<00:01:10.140> building<00:01:10.500> from

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
Traxxas bandit that I was building from

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.760 
Traxxas bandit that I was building from
scrap<00:01:11.070> parts<00:01:11.280> but<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.990> package<00:01:13.350> kind<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.680> got

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
scrap parts but the package kind of got

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.600 
scrap parts but the package kind of got
lost<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.520> well<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.710> got<00:01:16.710> impatient<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.369> went

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
lost and well I got impatient so I went

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.340 
lost and well I got impatient so I went
and<00:01:17.670> bought<00:01:17.820> one<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.570> metal

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
and bought one of the metal

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.230 
and bought one of the metal
transmissions<00:01:20.570> so<00:01:22.670> this<00:01:23.670> one<00:01:23.909> can<00:01:24.150> be<00:01:24.180> used

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
transmissions so this one can be used

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.590 
transmissions so this one can be used
for<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.659> slash<00:01:25.729> but<00:01:26.729> yeah<00:01:27.000> I've<00:01:27.270> done<00:01:27.450> this

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
for a slash but yeah I've done this

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.260 
for a slash but yeah I've done this
several<00:01:27.990> times<00:01:28.380> before<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.400> nothing<00:01:29.820> new<00:01:29.939> put

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
several times before so nothing new put

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.740 
several times before so nothing new put
the<00:01:30.390> bars<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:31.790> put<00:01:32.790> these<00:01:32.939> little<00:01:33.180> funny<00:01:33.450> gears

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
the bars in put these little funny gears

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:41.149 
the bars in put these little funny gears
in<00:01:35.750> shouldn't<00:01:36.750> be<00:01:36.840> too<00:01:37.020> hard<00:01:39.740> we<00:01:40.740> did<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.040> alone

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
in shouldn't be too hard we did it alone

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.920 
in shouldn't be too hard we did it alone
oh<00:01:41.340> there<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:42.860> put<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:44.040> part<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:44.930> funky

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
oh there it is put this part in funky

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.270 
oh there it is put this part in funky
little<00:01:46.170> gear<00:01:46.350> it's<00:01:46.649> probably<00:01:46.979> one<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.130> the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
little gear it's probably one of the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.399 
little gear it's probably one of the
funnest<00:01:48.119> things<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.659> put<00:01:48.810> together<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.290> my

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
funnest things to put together in my

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.090 
funnest things to put together in my
opinion<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:50.009> an<00:01:50.159> RC<00:01:51.380> okay<00:01:52.380> now<00:01:52.680> for<00:01:52.950> some

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
opinion on an RC okay now for some

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.700 
opinion on an RC okay now for some
grease<00:01:53.310> oh<00:01:53.579> yeah<00:01:54.420> before<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.200> put<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.530> grease

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
grease oh yeah before I put the grease

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.740 
grease oh yeah before I put the grease
in<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.040> need<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.280> put<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:56.579> little<00:01:56.820> bar<00:01:57.119> into

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
in I need to put this little bar into

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.580 
in I need to put this little bar into
that<00:01:57.990> center<00:01:58.500> gear<00:02:00.079> there<00:02:01.079> we<00:02:01.170> go

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
that center gear there we go

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.880 
that center gear there we go
no<00:02:01.920> no<00:02:01.979> just<00:02:02.780> kind<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.840> smear<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:04.439> all<00:02:04.680> in

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
no no just kind of smear this all in

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.500 
no no just kind of smear this all in
there<00:02:06.860> that<00:02:07.860> should<00:02:08.069> be<00:02:08.190> more<00:02:08.399> than<00:02:08.459> enough

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
there that should be more than enough

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.900 
there that should be more than enough
then<00:02:11.510> this<00:02:11.750> gear<00:02:12.200> goes<00:02:12.650> on<00:02:12.860> top<00:02:13.160> of<00:02:13.790> that

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
then this gear goes on top of that

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.839 
then this gear goes on top of that
little<00:02:14.180> bar<00:02:14.980> push<00:02:15.980> that<00:02:16.190> down<00:02:16.400> all<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.760> way

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
little bar push that down all the way

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.710 
little bar push that down all the way
get<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.360> lid<00:02:18.730> make<00:02:19.730> sure<00:02:20.000> I<00:02:20.030> matched<00:02:20.450> up

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
get the lid make sure I matched up

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.259 
get the lid make sure I matched up
properly

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.070 

there<00:02:26.269> it<00:02:26.510> is

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
there it is

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.750 
there it is
push<00:02:28.010> it<00:02:28.160> down<00:02:29.620> then<00:02:30.620> I<00:02:30.920> can<00:02:31.099> go<00:02:31.250> ahead<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:31.580> put

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
push it down then I can go ahead and put

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.920 
push it down then I can go ahead and put
these<00:02:31.880> four<00:02:32.180> screws<00:02:32.510> in<00:02:37.209> okay<00:02:38.209> all<00:02:38.660> four

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
these four screws in okay all four

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.809 
these four screws in okay all four
screws<00:02:39.319> are<00:02:39.500> in<00:02:39.680> let's<00:02:40.280> give<00:02:40.519> this<00:02:40.640> a<00:02:40.700> quick

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
screws are in let's give this a quick

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.710 
screws are in let's give this a quick
wipe<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:43.220> differential<00:02:43.850> gear<00:02:44.030> is<00:02:44.269> ready<00:02:44.540> to

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
wipe the differential gear is ready to

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.500 
wipe the differential gear is ready to
be<00:02:44.840> installed<00:02:45.080> into<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.799> transmission<00:02:49.450> so<00:02:50.450> I

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
be installed into the transmission so I

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.570 
be installed into the transmission so I
need<00:02:50.690> to<00:02:50.780> go<00:02:50.900> ahead<00:02:51.019> and<00:02:51.500> install<00:02:52.220> the

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
need to go ahead and install the

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.580 
need to go ahead and install the
bearings<00:02:53.030> on<00:02:53.420> each<00:02:54.019> side<00:02:54.349> of<00:02:54.530> the

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
bearings on each side of the

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.559 
bearings on each side of the
transmission<00:02:54.950> case<00:02:56.080> two<00:02:57.080> on<00:02:57.230> that<00:02:57.440> side<00:02:57.500> and

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
transmission case two on that side and

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.650 
transmission case two on that side and
two<00:02:59.569> on<00:02:59.959> this<00:03:00.349> side<00:03:00.790> now<00:03:01.790> this<00:03:01.970> transmission

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
two on this side now this transmission

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.660 
two on this side now this transmission
funny<00:03:02.900> enough<00:03:03.140> was<00:03:03.380> from<00:03:03.590> my<00:03:03.739> Rustler<00:03:04.190> and

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
funny enough was from my Rustler and

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.190 
funny enough was from my Rustler and
then<00:03:04.790> it<00:03:04.910> went<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:05.150> my<00:03:05.239> band-aid<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:05.900> then<00:03:06.049> it

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
then it went to my band-aid and then it

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.070 
then it went to my band-aid and then it
went<00:03:06.349> to<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.680> slash<00:03:07.209> so<00:03:08.209> it's<00:03:08.569> been<00:03:08.840> around

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
went to the slash so it's been around

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.500 
went to the slash so it's been around
the<00:03:09.980> other<00:03:10.130> two<00:03:10.370> bearings<00:03:10.849> that<00:03:11.060> go<00:03:11.360> on<00:03:11.420> the

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
the other two bearings that go on the

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.039 
the other two bearings that go on the
transmission<00:03:12.140> go<00:03:12.349> inside<00:03:13.239> the<00:03:14.239> idle<00:03:14.510> gear<00:03:14.780> now

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
transmission go inside the idle gear now

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.599 
transmission go inside the idle gear now
it's<00:03:15.200> funny<00:03:15.560> because<00:03:15.769> this<00:03:15.950> idle<00:03:16.280> gear<00:03:16.489> is

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
it's funny because this idle gear is

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.840 
it's funny because this idle gear is
also<00:03:17.060> plastic<00:03:17.810> it's<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:18.049> old<00:03:18.200> one<00:03:18.850> eventually

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
also plastic it's the old one eventually

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.759 
also plastic it's the old one eventually
I<00:03:19.880> will<00:03:20.120> have<00:03:20.420> to<00:03:20.810> replace<00:03:21.079> this<00:03:21.230> with<00:03:21.410> a<00:03:21.470> metal

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
I will have to replace this with a metal

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.500 
I will have to replace this with a metal
one<00:03:21.890> if<00:03:22.040> I<00:03:22.130> ever<00:03:22.280> go<00:03:22.519> over<00:03:22.549> Lydian<00:03:23.000> but<00:03:23.209> for<00:03:23.390> now

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
one if I ever go over Lydian but for now

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.860 
one if I ever go over Lydian but for now
like<00:03:24.170> I<00:03:24.290> mentioned<00:03:24.769> with<00:03:25.660> differential<00:03:26.660> gears

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
like I mentioned with differential gears

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.660 
like I mentioned with differential gears
the<00:03:27.109> plastic<00:03:27.560> will<00:03:27.769> work<00:03:28.010> because<00:03:28.370> it<00:03:28.489> will<00:03:28.579> be

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
the plastic will work because it will be

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.229 
the plastic will work because it will be
an<00:03:28.760> XL<00:03:29.150> 5<00:03:29.359> to<00:03:29.600> begin<00:03:29.870> with<00:03:30.790> so<00:03:31.790> we're<00:03:31.910> gonna<00:03:32.000> get

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
an XL 5 to begin with so we're gonna get

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.220 
an XL 5 to begin with so we're gonna get
this<00:03:32.390> thick<00:03:32.780> are<00:03:32.989> put<00:03:33.470> that<00:03:33.680> in<00:03:33.890> there<00:03:34.100> put<00:03:35.230> a

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
this thick are put that in there put a

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.940 
this thick are put that in there put a
washer<00:03:36.680> in<00:03:37.540> idle<00:03:38.540> gear<00:03:40.720> then<00:03:41.720> I'm<00:03:42.530> gonna<00:03:42.709> get

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
washer in idle gear then I'm gonna get

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.460 
washer in idle gear then I'm gonna get
the<00:03:43.310> drive<00:03:43.549> gear<00:03:43.910> and<00:03:44.299> like<00:03:45.019> I<00:03:45.139> mentioned

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
the drive gear and like I mentioned

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.770 
the drive gear and like I mentioned
before<00:03:45.500> this<00:03:45.980> was<00:03:46.190> all<00:03:46.549> donated<00:03:46.880> to<00:03:47.299> me<00:03:47.420> by

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
before this was all donated to me by

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.650 
before this was all donated to me by
Traxxas<00:03:48.769> RC<00:03:49.220> upgrades<00:03:49.730> all<00:03:50.180> these<00:03:50.359> all<00:03:50.540> the

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
Traxxas RC upgrades all these all the

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.990 
Traxxas RC upgrades all these all the
gears<00:03:50.900> it<00:03:51.319> did<00:03:51.709> come<00:03:51.889> with<00:03:51.920> a<00:03:52.069> case<00:03:52.670> but<00:03:52.940> that

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
gears it did come with a case but that

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.819 
gears it did come with a case but that
thing<00:03:53.359> was<00:03:53.480> pretty<00:03:53.720> beat<00:03:53.900> up<00:03:54.519> the<00:03:55.519> other<00:03:55.579> two

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
thing was pretty beat up the other two

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:03.449 
thing was pretty beat up the other two
washers<00:03:57.829> go<00:03:57.950> on<00:03:58.310> this<00:03:58.489> side<00:03:59.859> and<00:04:00.859> finally

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
washers go on this side and finally

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.979 
washers go on this side and finally
differential<00:04:04.459> gear<00:04:04.700> slides<00:04:05.269> in<00:04:05.600> just<00:04:05.870> like

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
differential gear slides in just like

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:11.250 
differential gear slides in just like
that<00:04:07.780> now<00:04:08.780> for<00:04:08.840> some<00:04:09.230> white<00:04:09.380> lithium<00:04:09.590> grease

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
that now for some white lithium grease

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.740 
that now for some white lithium grease
so<00:04:12.260> yeah<00:04:12.530> just<00:04:12.560> take<00:04:13.129> my<00:04:13.610> time<00:04:13.910> put<00:04:14.540> it<00:04:14.660> in

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
so yeah just take my time put it in

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.379 
so yeah just take my time put it in
between<00:04:14.870> the<00:04:15.080> gears<00:04:15.669> now<00:04:16.669> it's<00:04:16.820> kind<00:04:17.030> of<00:04:17.120> funny

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
between the gears now it's kind of funny

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.270 
between the gears now it's kind of funny
because<00:04:17.600> originally<00:04:19.060> when<00:04:20.060> I<00:04:20.479> first<00:04:20.750> started

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
because originally when I first started

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.590 
because originally when I first started
coming<00:04:22.280> up<00:04:22.490> with<00:04:22.639> the<00:04:22.790> idea<00:04:23.090> that<00:04:23.180> I<00:04:23.419> should

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
coming up with the idea that I should

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.770 
coming up with the idea that I should
build<00:04:23.720> a<00:04:23.870> sludge<00:04:24.199> it<00:04:24.560> was<00:04:24.710> gonna<00:04:24.919> be

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
build a sludge it was gonna be

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.300 
build a sludge it was gonna be
completely<00:04:26.780> built<00:04:27.020> from<00:04:27.260> parts<00:04:28.130> that<00:04:28.160> people

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
completely built from parts that people

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.850 
completely built from parts that people
decide<00:04:28.850> to<00:04:29.000> donate<00:04:29.180> to<00:04:29.570> me<00:04:29.720> but<00:04:30.470> that<00:04:30.650> didn't

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
decide to donate to me but that didn't

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.800 
decide to donate to me but that didn't
work<00:04:30.889> out<00:04:31.130> too<00:04:31.370> well<00:04:31.400> just<00:04:31.580> because<00:04:32.090> of<00:04:32.360> money

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
work out too well just because of money

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.300 
work out too well just because of money
shipping<00:04:33.199> and<00:04:33.440> handling<00:04:33.770> and<00:04:33.889> all<00:04:33.949> that<00:04:34.160> and

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
shipping and handling and all that and
