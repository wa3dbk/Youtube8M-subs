Lightroom<00:00:19.420> is<00:00:19.570> a<00:00:19.600> really<00:00:20.020> useful<00:00:20.140> tool

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
Lightroom is a really useful tool

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.470 
Lightroom is a really useful tool
because<00:00:21.070> what<00:00:21.250> it<00:00:21.340> effectively<00:00:21.850> enables<00:00:22.390> us

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
because what it effectively enables us

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.080 
because what it effectively enables us
to<00:00:22.540> do<00:00:22.869> is<00:00:23.140> extend<00:00:23.590> the<00:00:23.980> tonal<00:00:24.490> range<00:00:24.520> of<00:00:24.939> our

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
to do is extend the tonal range of our

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.990 
to do is extend the tonal range of our

shot and well expose raw file will
actually<00:00:28.330> contain<00:00:28.720> a<00:00:28.750> certain<00:00:29.020> amount<00:00:29.259> of

highlight end and this might not be

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.670 
highlight end and this might not be
immediately<00:00:34.330> visible<00:00:34.600> in<00:00:34.930> the<00:00:35.019> straight<00:00:35.320> shot

immediately visible in the straight shot

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.890 
immediately visible in the straight shot
but<00:00:36.400> with<00:00:36.550> proper<00:00:36.699> processing<00:00:37.480> you<00:00:37.870> can

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
but with proper processing you can

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.259 
but with proper processing you can
actually<00:00:38.350> extend<00:00:38.620> that<00:00:39.129> tonal<00:00:39.640> range<00:00:39.670> quite

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:40.269 
actually extend that tonal range quite

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:42.090 
actually extend that tonal range quite
considerably<00:00:40.870> which<00:00:41.080> is<00:00:41.230> really<00:00:41.559> helpful<00:00:41.830> if

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
considerably which is really helpful if

considerably which is really helpful if
you're<00:00:42.790> shooting<00:00:43.000> towards<00:00:43.780> a<00:00:43.870> window<00:00:44.230> where

a lot more fill flash just one movement
and<00:01:27.570> I'm<00:01:28.570> getting<00:01:28.810> this<00:01:28.990> so<00:01:29.800> I<00:01:30.040> think<00:01:30.160> for<00:01:30.580> real

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
and I'm getting this so I think for real

estate photography and interiors work

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.590 
estate photography and interiors work
it's<00:01:34.150> nice<00:01:34.510> tool<00:01:35.200> to<00:01:35.410> have<00:01:35.530> it<00:01:35.680> your<00:01:35.830> disposal

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
it's nice tool to have it your disposal

it's nice tool to have it your disposal
so<00:01:37.600> we're<00:01:37.690> going<00:01:37.810> to<00:01:37.900> take<00:01:38.020> a<00:01:38.050> look<00:01:38.200> at<00:01:38.320> how<00:01:38.440> the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
so we're going to take a look at how the

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.290 
so we're going to take a look at how the
highlights<00:01:38.950> recovery<00:01:39.460> slider<00:01:39.790> works<00:01:40.120> in

highlights recovery slider works in

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.690 
highlights recovery slider works in
practice<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.770> to<00:01:41.920> do<00:01:42.070> this<00:01:42.250> I've<00:01:42.430> got<00:01:42.580> this

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
practice and to do this I've got this

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.510 
practice and to do this I've got this
series<00:01:43.660> of<00:01:43.810> gray<00:01:44.100> rectangles<00:01:45.100> which<00:01:45.250> is<00:01:45.370> not

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
series of gray rectangles which is not

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.220 
series of gray rectangles which is not
most<00:01:45.730> inspirational<00:01:46.090> picture<00:01:46.690> I<00:01:46.720> know<00:01:46.840> but

as<00:02:05.710> I<00:02:05.890> mouse<00:02:06.159> over<00:02:06.400> it<00:02:06.729> you<00:02:07.210> can<00:02:07.360> see<00:02:07.540> the

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
as I mouse over it you can see the

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.719 
as I mouse over it you can see the
values<00:02:08.050> the<00:02:08.170> RGB<00:02:08.590> values<00:02:08.950> appearing<00:02:09.489> beneath

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
values the RGB values appearing beneath

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.670 
values the RGB values appearing beneath
the<00:02:09.849> histogram<00:02:10.330> over<00:02:10.599> here<00:02:10.840> and<00:02:10.959> there<00:02:11.470> around

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
the histogram over here and there around

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.259 
the histogram over here and there around
about<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.040> mid-50s<00:02:13.409> now<00:02:14.409> let's<00:02:15.159> say<00:02:15.459> that<00:02:16.060> I

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
about the mid-50s now let's say that I

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.570 
about the mid-50s now let's say that I
had<00:02:16.540> some<00:02:16.750> interesting<00:02:17.140> information<00:02:17.620> in<00:02:18.159> my

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
had some interesting information in my

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.440 
had some interesting information in my
raw<00:02:19.510> file<00:02:19.870> that<00:02:20.680> was<00:02:20.830> pretty<00:02:21.549> light<00:02:21.879> it<00:02:22.209> was

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
raw file that was pretty light it was

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.330 
raw file that was pretty light it was
round<00:02:22.659> about<00:02:22.959> here<00:02:23.319> you<00:02:23.500> can<00:02:23.709> see<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:23.890> value

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
round about here you can see the value

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.180 
round about here you can see the value
is<00:02:24.490> in<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.880> is<00:02:25.150> about<00:02:25.450> 90<00:02:25.990> and<00:02:26.260> I'd<00:02:26.890> like<00:02:27.130> that

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
is in the is about 90 and I'd like that

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.920 
is in the is about 90 and I'd like that
to<00:02:27.400> be<00:02:27.520> a

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
to be a

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.569 
to be a
bit<00:02:28.079> darker<00:02:28.500> let's<00:02:28.739> say<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:29.040> was<00:02:29.159> the<00:02:29.310> view

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
bit darker let's say that was the view

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.130 
bit darker let's say that was the view
through<00:02:29.909> a<00:02:29.939> window<00:02:30.299> and<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.510> want<00:02:30.659> to<00:02:30.719> pull<00:02:30.930> that

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
through a window and I want to pull that

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.800 
through a window and I want to pull that
down<00:02:31.379> a<00:02:31.439> little<00:02:31.650> bit<00:02:32.010> now<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:33.359> immediate

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
down a little bit now the immediate

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.740 
down a little bit now the immediate
solution<00:02:34.319> might<00:02:34.590> possibly<00:02:34.890> be<00:02:35.189> to<00:02:36.120> use<00:02:36.390> the

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
solution might possibly be to use the

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.440 
solution might possibly be to use the
exposure<00:02:37.439> slider<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.280> pull<00:02:38.909> that<00:02:39.150> down<00:02:39.390> a

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
exposure slider and pull that down a

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.080 
exposure slider and pull that down a
stop<00:02:40.079> you<00:02:40.379> see<00:02:40.620> I've<00:02:40.859> moved<00:02:41.579> the<00:02:41.760> exposure

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
stop you see I've moved the exposure

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.470 
stop you see I've moved the exposure
slider<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.750> I've<00:02:43.319> indeed<00:02:43.680> taken<00:02:44.099> that<00:02:44.939> value

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
slider and I've indeed taken that value

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.250 
slider and I've indeed taken that value
that<00:02:45.659> was<00:02:45.900> 90<00:02:46.439> down<00:02:47.129> to<00:02:47.310> about<00:02:47.459> 78<00:02:48.150> so<00:02:48.959> it's

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
that was 90 down to about 78 so it's

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.379 
that was 90 down to about 78 so it's
done<00:02:49.560> what<00:02:49.799> I<00:02:49.829> wanted<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.519> do<00:02:50.760> but<00:02:51.090> look

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:51.389 
done what I wanted it to do but look

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.149 
done what I wanted it to do but look
what<00:02:51.569> the<00:02:51.689> exposure<00:02:52.079> slider<00:02:52.439> has<00:02:52.650> done<00:02:52.889> to<00:02:53.069> all

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
what the exposure slider has done to all

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.670 
what the exposure slider has done to all
the<00:02:53.310> other<00:02:53.459> values<00:02:53.939> are<00:02:54.150> middle<00:02:55.019> gray<00:02:55.260> value

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
the other values are middle gray value

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.979 
the other values are middle gray value
that<00:02:55.859> was<00:02:55.950> in<00:02:56.069> the<00:02:56.159> mid-50s<00:02:56.730> is<00:02:57.000> now<00:02:57.510> down<00:02:57.780> to

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
that was in the mid-50s is now down to

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.559 
that was in the mid-50s is now down to
33<00:02:58.379> the<00:02:58.920> shadows<00:02:59.340> have<00:02:59.459> become<00:02:59.730> really<00:03:00.120> dark

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
33 the shadows have become really dark

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.050 
33 the shadows have become really dark
and<00:03:00.750> dingy<00:03:00.959> that's<00:03:01.859> our<00:03:02.069> starting<00:03:02.310> file<00:03:02.819> and

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
and dingy that's our starting file and

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.479 
and dingy that's our starting file and
by<00:03:03.689> moving<00:03:04.049> the<00:03:04.349> exposure<00:03:04.769> slider<00:03:05.189> all<00:03:05.459> the

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
by moving the exposure slider all the

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.539 
by moving the exposure slider all the
way<00:03:05.579> down<00:03:05.970> that's<00:03:06.750> really<00:03:07.230> blocked<00:03:08.159> up<00:03:08.370> these

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
way down that's really blocked up these

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.339 
way down that's really blocked up these
shadow<00:03:08.849> areas<00:03:09.329> let's<00:03:09.930> look<00:03:10.079> at<00:03:10.200> this<00:03:10.290> in

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
shadow areas let's look at this in

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.740 
shadow areas let's look at this in
practice<00:03:10.970> because<00:03:11.970> here's<00:03:12.209> our<00:03:12.359> standard

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
practice because here's our standard

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.349 
practice because here's our standard
shot<00:03:13.019> and<00:03:13.519> I<00:03:14.519> find<00:03:14.730> it's<00:03:14.879> a<00:03:14.939> really<00:03:15.180> useful

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
shot and I find it's a really useful

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.360 
shot and I find it's a really useful
exercise<00:03:15.810> if<00:03:16.169> you<00:03:16.200> just<00:03:16.439> press<00:03:16.620> V<00:03:16.980> on<00:03:17.159> your

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
exercise if you just press V on your

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.610 
exercise if you just press V on your
keyboard<00:03:17.579> you<00:03:18.450> can<00:03:18.480> convert<00:03:19.019> this<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.260> black

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
keyboard you can convert this to black

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.559 
keyboard you can convert this to black
and<00:03:19.829> white<00:03:19.980> it's<00:03:20.609> really<00:03:21.000> helpful<00:03:21.269> if<00:03:21.419> you're

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
and white it's really helpful if you're

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.330 
and white it's really helpful if you're
just<00:03:21.719> looking<00:03:21.810> at<00:03:22.169> the<00:03:22.290> tonal<00:03:22.739> values<00:03:22.889> of<00:03:23.219> your

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
just looking at the tonal values of your

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.679 
just looking at the tonal values of your
picture<00:03:23.700> you<00:03:23.790> can<00:03:23.879> always<00:03:24.060> go<00:03:24.180> out<00:03:24.329> to<00:03:24.450> color

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:24.689 
picture you can always go out to color

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:26.990 
picture you can always go out to color
later<00:03:24.989> on<00:03:25.290> so<00:03:26.069> that's<00:03:26.219> the<00:03:26.340> straight<00:03:26.609> shot<00:03:26.879> in

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
later on so that's the straight shot in

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.899 
later on so that's the straight shot in
black<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.419> white<00:03:27.540> no<00:03:28.019> adjustments<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:28.909> again

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:29.909 
black and white no adjustments and again

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.379 
black and white no adjustments and again
if<00:03:30.120> I<00:03:30.389> am<00:03:30.840> tempted<00:03:31.739> to<00:03:32.579> move<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:33.000> exposure

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
if I am tempted to move the exposure

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.349 
if I am tempted to move the exposure
slider<00:03:33.949> minus<00:03:34.949> one<00:03:35.190> move<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.329> left

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
slider minus one move it to the left

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.319 
slider minus one move it to the left
under<00:03:36.840> expose<00:03:37.440> that's<00:03:38.280> great<00:03:38.669> I'm<00:03:38.909> certainly

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
under expose that's great I'm certainly

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.569 
under expose that's great I'm certainly
getting<00:03:39.569> my<00:03:39.840> detail<00:03:40.319> in<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.949> floorboards

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
getting my detail in the floorboards

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.969 
getting my detail in the floorboards
here<00:03:41.849> and<00:03:42.180> through<00:03:42.479> the<00:03:42.599> window<00:03:42.959> etc<00:03:43.229> as<00:03:43.919> I

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:43.979 
here and through the window etc as I

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:46.729 
here and through the window etc as I
would<00:03:44.489> like<00:03:44.699> to<00:03:44.729> see<00:03:45.120> but<00:03:45.810> of<00:03:45.930> course<00:03:45.959> at<00:03:46.409> the

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
would like to see but of course at the

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.240 
would like to see but of course at the
expense<00:03:47.250> of<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:48.030> shadow<00:03:48.299> areas<00:03:48.799> I'm<00:03:49.799> really

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
expense of the shadow areas I'm really

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.490 
expense of the shadow areas I'm really
blocking<00:03:51.000> up<00:03:51.239> those<00:03:51.419> shadows<00:03:51.780> by<00:03:51.989> using<00:03:52.260> the

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
blocking up those shadows by using the

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.349 
blocking up those shadows by using the
exposure<00:03:52.829> slider<00:03:53.189> so<00:03:54.030> that's<00:03:54.689> this<00:03:55.349> time

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
exposure slider so that's this time

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.909 
exposure slider so that's this time
rather<00:03:57.359> than<00:03:57.509> moving<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:58.019> exposure<00:03:58.500> slider

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919 
rather than moving the exposure slider

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:00.589 
rather than moving the exposure slider
we're<00:03:59.280> going<00:03:59.370> to<00:03:59.489> move<00:03:59.609> the<00:03:59.729> highlight<00:04:00.239> slider

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
we're going to move the highlight slider

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.229 
we're going to move the highlight slider
all<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:00.959> way<00:04:01.079> to<00:04:01.229> the<00:04:01.470> left<00:04:01.769> we<00:04:02.579> go<00:04:02.729> back<00:04:02.970> to

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
all the way to the left we go back to

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.259 
all the way to the left we go back to
our<00:04:03.269> high<00:04:04.109> value<00:04:04.769> here<00:04:05.159> we've<00:04:05.699> taken<00:04:06.030> that

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
our high value here we've taken that

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.759 
our high value here we've taken that
down<00:04:06.479> to<00:04:06.659> 80<00:04:06.870> from<00:04:08.209> 90<00:04:09.209> where<00:04:09.419> it<00:04:09.540> was<00:04:09.720> so<00:04:10.530> we've

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
down to 80 from 90 where it was so we've

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.189 
down to 80 from 90 where it was so we've
taken<00:04:11.180> down<00:04:12.180> those<00:04:12.449> are<00:04:12.599> other<00:04:12.750> blitzed

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.199 
taken down those are other blitzed

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:14.539 
taken down those are other blitzed
highlights<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:13.829> something<00:04:14.189> more<00:04:14.340> manageable

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
highlights to something more manageable

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.420 
highlights to something more manageable
and<00:04:15.060> totally<00:04:15.540> readable<00:04:15.949> but<00:04:16.949> the<00:04:17.130> nice<00:04:17.400> thing

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
and totally readable but the nice thing

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.140 
and totally readable but the nice thing
about<00:04:17.729> the<00:04:18.030> highlight<00:04:18.479> slider<00:04:18.840> is<00:04:19.139> that<00:04:19.470> it's

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
about the highlight slider is that it's

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.330 
about the highlight slider is that it's
preferentially<00:04:21.710> adjusted<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:22.979> brighter

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
preferentially adjusted the brighter

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.749 
preferentially adjusted the brighter
values<00:04:23.940> so<00:04:24.599> that<00:04:24.630> our<00:04:24.900> middle<00:04:25.259> gray<00:04:25.560> is<00:04:26.280> still

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:26.759 
values so that our middle gray is still

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:28.310 
values so that our middle gray is still
it's<00:04:27.060> gone<00:04:27.240> that<00:04:27.389> a<00:04:27.419> little<00:04:27.690> bit<00:04:27.810> it's<00:04:28.020> down<00:04:28.199> to

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
it's gone that a little bit it's down to

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.029 
it's gone that a little bit it's down to
50<00:04:28.740> from<00:04:28.919> 55<00:04:29.460> that's<00:04:30.360> where<00:04:30.570> we<00:04:30.659> kicked<00:04:30.900> off<00:04:31.080> so

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
50 from 55 that's where we kicked off so

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:36.469 
50 from 55 that's where we kicked off so
it's<00:04:32.220> 53<00:04:32.940> or<00:04:33.300> so<00:04:34.789> moving<00:04:35.789> highlight<00:04:36.120> slider

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
it's 53 or so moving highlight slider

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.860 
it's 53 or so moving highlight slider
we've<00:04:37.349> actually<00:04:37.620> kept<00:04:38.250> our<00:04:38.520> middle<00:04:39.450> values

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
we've actually kept our middle values

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.340 
we've actually kept our middle values
and<00:04:40.110> hive<00:04:40.529> at<00:04:40.800> well

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
and hive at well

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.840

really<00:04:45.700> blocked<00:04:45.970> up<00:04:46.210> but<00:04:46.780> we<00:04:46.900> have<00:04:46.930> taken

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
really blocked up but we have taken

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.100 
really blocked up but we have taken
those<00:04:47.530> upper<00:04:47.800> values<00:04:48.160> down<00:04:48.400> so<00:04:49.240> to<00:04:49.720> go<00:04:49.870> to<00:04:49.930> this

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
those upper values down so to go to this

one in black and white here's the shot

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.520 
one in black and white here's the shot
we've<00:04:53.140> kept<00:04:54.000> some<00:04:55.000> nice<00:04:55.240> shadow<00:04:55.600> details<00:04:56.230> such

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
we've kept some nice shadow details such

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.730 
we've kept some nice shadow details such
as<00:04:56.560> it<00:04:56.890> is<00:04:57.100> in<00:04:57.400> the<00:04:57.910> file<00:04:58.150> but<00:04:59.110> we've<00:04:59.320> managed

to burn in detail in the highlights so

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.450 
to burn in detail in the highlights so

the highlight slider to give that nice

areas where I'd like to see the image

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.150 
areas where I'd like to see the image
have<00:06:31.390> a<00:06:31.420> little<00:06:31.750> more<00:06:31.960> lift<00:06:32.290> and<00:06:32.590> I<00:06:32.680> can<00:06:32.860> afford

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 
have a little more lift and I can afford

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.480 
have a little more lift and I can afford
for<00:06:33.490> it<00:06:33.550> to<00:06:33.700> be<00:06:33.850> a<00:06:34.030> little<00:06:34.600> lighter<00:06:34.990> in<00:06:35.200> tone

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
for it to be a little lighter in tone

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.940 
for it to be a little lighter in tone
just<00:06:36.490> to<00:06:36.670> stop<00:06:36.880> it<00:06:37.030> getting<00:06:37.260> too<00:06:38.260> muddy<00:06:38.650> in

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:38.950 
just to stop it getting too muddy in

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.460 
just to stop it getting too muddy in
those<00:06:39.280> mid-tones<00:06:40.020> it<00:06:41.020> doesn't<00:06:41.320> take<00:06:41.440> very

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.470 
those mid-tones it doesn't take very

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.320 
those mid-tones it doesn't take very
long<00:06:41.680> and<00:06:42.100> you<00:06:42.220> can<00:06:42.370> use<00:06:42.490> a<00:06:42.520> big<00:06:42.790> broad<00:06:43.030> brush

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
long and you can use a big broad brush

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.190 
long and you can use a big broad brush
and<00:06:43.630> I<00:06:44.320> think<00:06:44.620> it<00:06:44.710> makes<00:06:44.890> a<00:06:45.100> better<00:06:46.060> image<00:06:46.390> so

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:47.200 
and I think it makes a better image so

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.590 
and I think it makes a better image so
the<00:06:47.500> messages<00:06:48.370> you<00:06:48.400> can<00:06:48.670> use<00:06:49.090> the<00:06:49.270> highlight

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.390 
but use it with care and
stand<00:06:54.450> what<00:06:54.570> it's<00:06:54.750> doing<00:06:55.200> to<00:06:55.380> the<00:06:55.890> tonal

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 
stand what it's doing to the tonal
