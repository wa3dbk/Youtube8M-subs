00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.560 

for<00:03:02.800> this<00:03:02.890> particular<00:03:03.130> model<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.940> Arline<00:03:04.360> it

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
for this particular model the Arline it

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.340 
for this particular model the Arline it
comes<00:03:04.750> with<00:03:04.900> a<00:03:04.960> 3.6<00:03:05.740> v6<00:03:06.630> giving<00:03:07.630> 280

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
comes with a 3.6 v6 giving 280

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.380 
comes with a 3.6 v6 giving 280
horsepower<00:03:08.590> which<00:03:09.190> is<00:03:09.220> it's<00:03:09.760> not<00:03:09.940> bad<00:03:10.180> you

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
horsepower which is it's not bad you

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.090 
horsepower which is it's not bad you
know<00:03:10.510> it's<00:03:10.660> pretty<00:03:10.780> good<00:03:10.900> but<00:03:11.740> then<00:03:11.890> for<00:03:12.070> our

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
know it's pretty good but then for our

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.130 
know it's pretty good but then for our
models<00:03:12.580> like<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.850> TDI<00:03:13.120> you<00:03:13.270> got<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:13.750> diesel

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
models like the TDI you got the diesel

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.440 
models like the TDI you got the diesel
which<00:03:14.260> is<00:03:14.410> a<00:03:14.440> 3.0<00:03:15.060> turbo<00:03:16.060> charge<00:03:18.060> with<00:03:19.060> a<00:03:19.090> great

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
which is a 3.0 turbo charge with a great

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.140 
which is a 3.0 turbo charge with a great
gas<00:03:19.750> mileage<00:03:19.780> it<00:03:20.320> gives<00:03:20.470> about<00:03:20.650> 21<00:03:21.310> miles<00:03:22.060> per

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
gas mileage it gives about 21 miles per

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.570 
gas mileage it gives about 21 miles per
gallon<00:03:22.540> average<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:23.170> then<00:03:24.040> for<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.370> hybrid

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
gallon average and then for the hybrid

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.200 
gallon average and then for the hybrid
you<00:03:25.060> got<00:03:25.240> another<00:03:25.590> 3.0<00:03:26.590> v6<00:03:26.890> but<00:03:27.820> it<00:03:27.910> is<00:03:28.030> run<00:03:28.180> by

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.210 
you got another 3.0 v6 but it is run by

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.330 
you got another 3.0 v6 but it is run by
a<00:03:28.930> whole<00:03:29.200> battery<00:03:29.560> system<00:03:29.950> like<00:03:30.100> a<00:03:30.130> regular

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
a whole battery system like a regular

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.060 
a whole battery system like a regular
hybrid<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:33.270> that's<00:03:34.270> when<00:03:34.540> a<00:03:34.570> little

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
hybrid and that's when a little

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.980 
hybrid and that's when a little
confusing<00:03:36.070> it<00:03:36.760> gets<00:03:37.090> a<00:03:37.150> little<00:03:37.270> confusing<00:03:37.780> out

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
confusing it gets a little confusing out

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.450 
confusing it gets a little confusing out
there<00:03:38.170> because<00:03:38.350> I<00:03:38.470> have<00:03:38.740> R<00:03:38.770> it<00:03:38.950> will<00:03:38.980> give<00:03:39.340> you

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.460 
there because I have R it will give you

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.610 
there because I have R it will give you
around<00:03:39.730> 20<00:03:40.270> miles<00:03:40.450> per<00:03:40.600> gallon<00:03:41.020> average<00:03:41.170> you

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
around 20 miles per gallon average you

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.380 
around 20 miles per gallon average you
know<00:03:41.740> when<00:03:41.950> you<00:03:42.460> can<00:03:42.640> go<00:03:42.760> over<00:03:42.820> the<00:03:43.000> diesel

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
mileage in a hybrid you know so that's

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.300 
mileage in a hybrid you know so that's
something<00:03:50.350> to<00:03:50.560> think<00:03:50.590> about<00:03:50.830> when<00:03:51.190> you're
