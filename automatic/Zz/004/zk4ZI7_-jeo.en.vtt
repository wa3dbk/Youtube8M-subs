 hello very good to all that another visit 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.160
 with another video from minecraft in my 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.170
 channel and good is a video tutorial of 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.209
 minecraft from the highland server that 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.860
 we have and it is a tutorial as you see 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:14.049
 in the basic protection title it is worth 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.750
 Protection for trunks protection 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.280
 for doors protecting houses like 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.140
 let people build your house and everything 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.280
 that and well the first case let's go 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.220
 to suppose that this is a city 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.900
 main vale is a city created by 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.390
 the administrators and for the whole world 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.740
 so we get in here we found a 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.930
 plot that we want to buy and we want 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.300
 buy it we have to choose a city 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.800
 main voucher for the moment 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.739
 there is only one principal that is in the 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.629
 that we appear to buy the house well 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.720
 that we are looking for a plot and for 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.180
 buy it we give you right button 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.210
 ok i know access hollywood the legend 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.210
 test buyers nipones soul 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.620
 of subtle we can break the poster and now 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.750
 this house is ours we can build 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.950
 We can do whatever we want, it's worth 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.780
 we want to do now because we want 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.160
 build build we can already but 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.680
 example we want the case of leaving a 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.910
 our friend build in here inside 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.130
 what do we do bar space region 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.810
 info this is to know the name of the 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.030
 region but right now there's no reason why 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.220
 Well what we have to do is 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.140
 get the money to buy our 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.640
 plot usually cost 500 dollars inside 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.350
 of the main cities 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.030
 so nothing we already have 500 dollars 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.380
 We want to buy this plot to be able to 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.920
 build media that we make button 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.330
 right and it's ok we have 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.009
 our purchased plot we can already 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.299
 build do what we want inside 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.000
 of her outside will not leave us 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.280
 build so nothing we break the 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.720
 poster we are inside the bárcena 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.130
 we are going to do what we want and we are going 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.020
 to give permission to a friend so he can 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.460
 build our house with us that 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.130
 we find out the name of the region 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.200
 bar region info although also what 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.939
 put on the poster as it is called test 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.580
 ok now let's give permission for 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:56.090
 example the first one that we see detroit 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:59.610
 I like that name bar region 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.130
 in space the name of the region that 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.550
 it's test space the name of the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.140
 person who is from bar they lowered and 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.300
 We give the inter 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.020
 preval region of haiti now we give to 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.720
 the region info and is already within region 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.730
 Own proof is troll and disinterest already 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.709
 it is already we can deconstruct this 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.630
 for trusted people now if 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.400
 we want to give someone permission but 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.400
 that does not have complete control instead of 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.350
 have put bar region to put the 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.630
 name of the test plot and the name 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.920
 for example goku is already the 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.290
 difference between one and another that lautner 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.970
 can manage the people who can 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.440
 build and the member can only 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.180
 build and not manage the plot 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.980
 ok we have this done and what 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.650
 we want is to put a door to put 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.540
 trunks and a little bit of everything goes to 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.750
 search around here for a trunk we will look for 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.760
 a door down here I think it's 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.489
 here the door and let's find a 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.830
 Dispense a dispenser not an oven where 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.480
 there is the oven where the oven is 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.159
 it's worth 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.379
 what happens when we place a 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:03.360
 oven automatically protects us you see 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.940
 created a private type burn does 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.500
 properly good a private oven so 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.299
 as the pronunciation and we want to put 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.510
 also a trunk and let's put our 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.510
 door 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.350
 we can open that door and close it 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.700
 now we want to give permission to troll 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.780
 so I can open our door that 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.360
 do bar l wc space modify 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.550
 space the name of the bar player 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.040
 low troll we give the enter button 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.810
 right and you're done but my registered 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.370
 the permissions for drone player what 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:36.280
 same we can do in the dispenser the 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:38.050
 wc modify from low bar whole troll 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.940
 and the same thing we could do in the trunk 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.650
 it's worth so nothing this is all that is 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.120
 can do inside a house to give 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.060
 permits our friends to embroider 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.740
 this is for a major city like this 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.959
 that nothing will happen to a house that does not 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.450
 we want to do for example outside of 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.280
 the city 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.989
 it is worth now finally we are given the case 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.700
 that we want to leave a partner 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.190
 our build in our area 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.000
 protected outside the cities so 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.599
 what we have to do is introduce 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.459
 a command bars reid peset the name 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.050
 of the area that is proof that we can 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.390
 find out by putting value of that space 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.030
 info, you can see that he puts us here 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.980
 up in red in green test to simón 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.590
 psd values the name the residence 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.329
 which is test the player's name at 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.220
 that we want to leave in this bar case 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.220
 low troll space 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.190
 the flame that they can put many 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.130
 flash in this case we will put trust 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.720
 is that it covers both the build and the 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.490
 the use of good buttons I leave all 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.970
 in the video exhibition trust &amp; 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.949
 space true enter and you see that by the 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.910
 established term that is flag 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.229
 established that we have given 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.090
 example in one permission to open 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.889
 doors in another permit to use 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.680
 our our kilns in another permit 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:49.139
 to build so nothing this is all 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.820
 to build good then the trunks and 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.919
 everyone is still protecting us alone and 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.300
 Finally, if you put a trunk in one place 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.250
 that is not protected innovates and does not 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.630
 you want to eliminate it because then people 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.340
 you can not eliminate them worth those trunks 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.510
 they will be protected forever 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.200
 and no one hands to finally eliminate 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.000
 related to the size of the 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.100
 residences we can also modify the 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.810
 size of the main residence and what 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.370
 what we have to do is select with 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.930
 the wooden shovel again the new ones 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.669
 points we want to assert or be 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.720
 modify it again I will have to 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.850
 eliminate it and recreate it 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.520
 we select the second point and we put 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:23.940
 bar 3 select bird again and then 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.350
 we put barrales area replace the 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.910
 name of the residence that is called 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.550
 test space 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:32.190
 and in the main we give the enter and you see that 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.990
 it puts us updated area good by 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.700
 last if you want to eliminate them residence 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.650
 because there is a limit of residences that 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.060
 you can do that they are five subzones 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.430
 What is this we have done here? 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.590
 they can only do three so what 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.820
 What we can do is what you have to 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.780
 do to eliminate residency by 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.550
 example you can see a list of 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.580
 residences made by you can 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.580
 put for networks space list and then 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:56.250
 you can eliminate it by putting for networks 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:58.530
 spaces of much space test him 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.300
 we give the enter and there is the science 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.680
 Illuminated evidence there are times asking 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.090
 confirmation and you have to put 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.979
 just now see that space with 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.479
 sign and with that you will be eliminated 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:08.729
 decide if you can create another without any 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:10.200
 problem and then finally if you want 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:11.520
 you can put a sign on the door of 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.139
 our house so that people know 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.680
 who lives there and you can put the 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:19.410
 bracket pss we close bracket and we put 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.330
 the name of our or our 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.860
 minecraft name which in this case is 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.750
 your interest does not need to move the 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.639
 lyrics to compose that's worth and here what 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.870
 we have schutter is online 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:29.520
 we are disconnected it puts us of 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:32.190
 schutter is offline 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.750
 from the day when such and such 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.580
 natal this is all about protection 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.659
 basic of many people I asked for it because 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.160
 there are many new people on the server 

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:41.850
 look how the server is 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.170
 with 53 people so I do not expect anything 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.370
 keep enjoying the server left us 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.590
