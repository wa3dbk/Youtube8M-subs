00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
basically now ace explain the rules to

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.470 
basically now ace explain the rules to
you<00:02:24.650> guys<00:02:24.860> so<00:02:25.250> each<00:02:25.550> person<00:02:25.819> has<00:02:26.090> one<00:02:26.209> team<00:02:26.450> you

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
you guys so each person has one team you

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.240 
you guys so each person has one team you
play<00:02:26.810> in<00:02:26.989> their<00:02:27.140> team<00:02:27.380> they'd<00:02:27.860> had<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.069> make<00:02:28.220> a

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
play in their team they'd had to make a

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.190 
play in their team they'd had to make a
silver<00:02:28.700> team<00:02:28.910> based<00:02:29.239> around<00:02:29.569> that<00:02:29.810> player<00:02:30.050> so

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
silver team based around that player so

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.960 
silver team based around that player so
you<00:02:30.230> take<00:02:30.440> a<00:02:30.470> Portuguese<00:02:30.860> side<00:02:31.040> or<00:02:31.160> BBVA<00:02:31.610> side

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
you take a Portuguese side or BBVA side

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.790 
you take a Portuguese side or BBVA side
of<00:02:32.090> a<00:02:32.150> sea<00:02:32.239> based<00:02:32.420> around<00:02:32.600> Ronaldo<00:02:33.140> from<00:02:33.650> know

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
of a sea based around Ronaldo from know

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.949 
of a sea based around Ronaldo from know
a<00:02:33.830> template<00:02:34.250> over<00:02:34.459> twice<00:02:34.790> in<00:02:35.090> a<00:02:35.180> league<00:02:35.390> format

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
a template over twice in a league format

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.110 
a template over twice in a league format
a<00:02:36.230> home-and-away<00:02:36.860> game<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.489> a<00:02:37.519> home<00:02:37.910> game

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
a home-and-away game and a home game

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.280 
a home-and-away game and a home game
will<00:02:38.269> be<00:02:38.330> uploaded<00:02:38.720> on<00:02:38.810> each<00:02:38.959> person's
