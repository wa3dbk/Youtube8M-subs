know how but it happens and then W topia
because<00:02:50.560> it's<00:02:50.800> probably<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.220> easiest<00:02:51.520> to<00:02:51.730> go

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
because it's probably the easiest to go

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.979 
because it's probably the easiest to go
