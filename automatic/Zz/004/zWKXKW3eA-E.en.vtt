00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 our people here do not speak the local language and our kings did not get to 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.730
 time to help them 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.160
 forced to adopt not only three foreigners burned all the books 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.229
 Ethiopian 

00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:15.999
 so only the memory remains to give us testimony of an event 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:17.650
 eight centuries ago 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.140
 in the times of the Templars 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.340
 so 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.169
 a young prince from ethiopia sought refuge to the fifth 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:30.059
 it was called freedom advertising with if he was here at that time 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:34.590
 housing one of your rivals in the fight for the throne 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.929
 must have provided very valuable information the Templars 

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:42.460
 the live the ulloa jerusalem accompanied only by a few supporters twenty 

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:46.730
 years later he returned with many to Ethiopia to claim his throne 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.310
 came back with a lot of people in strict what I managed to rebuild 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.480
 is that there was a meeting with this future king and freedom 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.640
 and in that meeting the lawyer informed the Templars that the ark 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.350
 of the alliance was in ethiopia I think they made a deal there diego costa 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.700
 they wanted the art and he wanted to be the king of ethiopia 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.560
 for them it was a powerful military order 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.150
 he told them to give him back the throne they allow access this object I think 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.540
 that's what happened 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.540
 most scholars ignore this important fact 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:27.869
 they do not pay attention to this home at the time when housing returned 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.679
 to ethiopia the knights created a small fleet in the cellar that sailed 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:36.149
 by the Red Sea and attacked the Muslim ships of the Mecca could this fleet 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.149
 to have led the dragonfly to the throne of the uncle pía 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.380
 dep txantrea trains the Templar evidence played a crucial role in my 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.609
 own justice 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:51.460
 meek 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.280
 It made me trust that there was much more than certain of what the specialists 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.010
 they were willing to admit the tradition according to which for 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.980
 Ethiopians possessed the ark 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.370
 but I was facing a real problem the story of menelik bringing the ark 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.370
 of the Ethiopian alliance could not be true 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.629
 so if the art had come ethiopian year what I needed was 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.019
 discover how there had to be an explanation 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:23.649
 and that's how I started to investigate 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.299
 the bible says nothing about the disappearance of his relic more pleases 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.989
 immerse this fact in mystery 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.040
 Jewish tradition holds that the ark was hidden to preserve it from 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.420
 the armies of Assyria and Babylon 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.510
 but a study are fault of it hit king of israel 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:58.039
 and I think writing disappeared during the night time because it was a 

00:02:58.039 --> 00:03:01.589
 chapter of shareholder csi in the history of the first period of the temple 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.029
 manassé 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:10.419
 he was a ruler paying 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:14.370
 vicente he introduced a sidewalk image into the temple 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.349
 efe 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.349
 mouche who is a calamita deity 

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:24.239
 an image an idol both 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:31.379
 couto the image will already be the ark could not be together was a problem 

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:37.299
 of prices the priests of jerusalem would not allow such thing 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:43.089
 neither the prophets nor the people in general do not 

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:48.600
 this the experts emphasize that emanated spilled a lot of blood dt 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.399
 9 ma 

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:54.709
 2 so much that it flooded Jerusalem 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.159
 of innocent blood emotion 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.089
 pines I felt helpless 

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:03.089
 d is a way to allude to the blood of the prophets 

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:07.599
 to look like the popular prophets 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:08.400
 boedo 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.380
 putin who tried to defend the ancient religion of the Jews 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:20.039
 not now well and intel ready that's suggested in three or four words like 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.379
 Many 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:24.729
 before the psoe 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.919
 busti as I said 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.919
 that was so disgusting for tourists 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.960
 because they did not want to extend more 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.409
 5 understand it soon saved words 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.540
 they talk about this very concisely 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:45.169
 and when we want to know why Jerusalem was destroyed, your answer is 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.169
 precisely for the sins of the night 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.080
 in the years after Malaysia 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.520
 the prophet Jeremiah laments the loss of the ark and the next end of 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.719
 Israel 

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:02.819
 and soon after arrive the armies of Assyria and Babylon 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:18.460
 in the tunnels and caverns of the temple mount the Jews lament the fall of 

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:23.229
 Jerusalem the destruction of the first and second temples 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:27.080
 but only a few know the existence of another temple 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.879
 a third temple built by refugees from the persecutions of man 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:33.929
 so they took as a verse a scripture verse 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.710
 other side all everything all this there we go two cars Sunday all everything 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:45.600
 it was all murphy in particular there will be an altar for the lord in the middle of the 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.660
 Egyptian land in such a sense entity near its borders because of it 

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:56.579
 pekin 18 oct the guide command this biblical verse jimena in the 

00:05:56.579 --> 00:06:01.009
 times when the temple of jerusalem was not paralyzed a group of priests 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:06.149
 fled to egypt from there they built substitute temples on the mainland 

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:09.149
 we can 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:18.770
 the island of the iron santillán 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.180
 for more than a century it housed a colony of Jewish soldiers 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:27.020
 mercenaries paid by the pharaohs to monitor the southern border of egypt 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.150
 the site has been excavated by German archaeologists 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:36.089
