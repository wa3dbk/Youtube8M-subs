are filled with lines so what I'm doing

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.719 
are filled with lines so what I'm doing
is<00:01:10.020> I'm<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:10.500> pretending<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.430> there's<00:01:11.670> a

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
is I'm just pretending that there's a

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.020 
is I'm just pretending that there's a
circle<00:01:12.270> like<00:01:12.570> that

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
circle like that

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.750 
circle like that
and<00:01:15.030> going<00:01:15.270> through<00:01:16.159> and<00:01:17.159> drawing<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.729> line

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
and going through and drawing a line

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.580 
and going through and drawing a line
circle<00:01:18.510> in<00:01:18.659> there<00:01:18.870> do<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.229> see<00:01:19.320> how<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.560> did

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
that there's a circle here I'm gonna go

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.859 
that there's a circle here I'm gonna go
through<00:01:35.760> and<00:01:36.690> draw<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:37.860> lines<00:01:38.270> and<00:01:39.270> make<00:01:39.840> a

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
through and draw in lines and make a

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.680 
through and draw in lines and make a
circle<00:01:40.500> like<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> pearance<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.180> circle

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
circle like in a pearance of a circle

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.070 
circle like in a pearance of a circle
okay<00:01:43.970> like<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:46.310> if<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.430> get<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.720> the

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
okay like that and if I get to on the

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.800 
okay like that and if I get to on the
circular<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:50.100> go<00:01:50.280> back<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.700> with<00:01:50.820> black<00:01:51.180> and

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
circular you go back in with black and

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.899 
circular you go back in with black and
then<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.439> just<00:01:52.619> kind<00:01:52.830> of<00:01:52.920> shore<00:01:53.189> up<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:53.670> it's<00:01:53.820> a

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
then you just kind of shore up so it's a

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.100 
then you just kind of shore up so it's a
circle<00:01:54.330> and<00:01:54.869> I'm<00:01:54.960> going<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.200> do<00:01:55.320> those<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:57.110> blue

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
circle and I'm going to do those in blue

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.740 
circle and I'm going to do those in blue
and<00:01:58.590> then<00:01:58.920> I'm<00:01:59.040> gonna<00:01:59.159> go<00:01:59.340> back<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.600> I'm

nail so that you guys can see and for
beginners<00:02:40.130> I<00:02:40.520> don't<00:02:41.390> know<00:02:41.480> if<00:02:41.540> you<00:02:41.630> can<00:02:41.720> do

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
beginners I don't know if you can do

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.520 
beginners I don't know if you can do
this<00:02:41.990> but<00:02:42.140> if<00:02:42.290> you're<00:02:43.240> okay<00:02:44.240> so<00:02:44.380> making<00:02:45.380> a

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
this but if you're okay so making a

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.250 
this but if you're okay so making a
square<00:02:45.770> then<00:02:46.400> I'm<00:02:46.550> making<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:47.120> square<00:02:47.900> circle

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
square then I'm making a square circle

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.580 
square then I'm making a square circle
then<00:02:49.070> another<00:02:49.430> one<00:02:49.840> that<00:02:50.840> is<00:02:50.900> square<00:02:51.380> like

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
then another one that is square like

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
then another one that is square like
that<00:02:51.620> so<00:02:52.040> it<00:02:52.100> goes<00:02:52.280> into<00:02:52.430> lunch<00:02:52.990> then<00:02:54.610> under

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
that so it goes into lunch then under

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.970 
that so it goes into lunch then under
that<00:02:55.640> I'm<00:02:56.570> gonna<00:02:56.780> do<00:02:56.930> it<00:02:57.050> with<00:02:57.170> another<00:02:57.410> one<00:02:57.680> a

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
that I'm gonna do it with another one a

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.460 
that I'm gonna do it with another one a
little<00:02:58.640> dot<00:02:59.090> a<00:02:59.120> little<00:02:59.420> line<00:02:59.570> and<00:03:00.080> then<00:03:00.230> make

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
little dot a little line and then make

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.460 
little dot a little line and then make
it<00:03:00.500> like<00:03:00.890> this<00:03:01.570> and<00:03:02.570> what<00:03:02.750> I'm<00:03:02.870> doing<00:03:02.900> is<00:03:03.290> I'm

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
it like this and what I'm doing is I'm

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.130 
it like this and what I'm doing is I'm
building<00:03:03.680> up<00:03:04.070> a<00:03:04.220> circle<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:05.060> then<00:03:05.690> building

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
building up a circle and then building

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.840 
building up a circle and then building
back<00:03:07.070> down<00:03:07.660> into<00:03:08.660> a<00:03:08.690> circle<00:03:09.370> so<00:03:10.370> it'll<00:03:10.730> look

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
back down into a circle so it'll look

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.750 
back down into a circle so it'll look
like<00:03:10.910> that<00:03:11.440> then<00:03:12.440> I'm<00:03:12.560> gonna<00:03:12.709> shore<00:03:13.520> up<00:03:13.640> the

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
like that then I'm gonna shore up the

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.949 
like that then I'm gonna shore up the
sides<00:03:14.080> so<00:03:15.080> that<00:03:15.110> it's<00:03:15.350> a<00:03:15.410> perfect<00:03:15.860> circle<00:03:16.959> like

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
sides so that it's a perfect circle like

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.570 
sides so that it's a perfect circle like
that<00:03:18.290> and<00:03:18.709> I<00:03:18.770> think<00:03:18.830> I'm<00:03:19.070> gonna<00:03:19.160> go<00:03:19.310> through

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
all of them and do these checkerboard

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.250 
all of them and do these checkerboard
nails<00:03:21.770> first<00:03:22.250> is<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.270> checkerboard<00:03:23.660> circles
