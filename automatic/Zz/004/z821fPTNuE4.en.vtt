it'll be a completely different fight
and<00:00:50.850> even<00:00:51.420> if<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.750> fight<00:00:51.960> against<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.199> same

Defense's you know there the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.599 
Defense's you know there the
personalities<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.289> mixed<00:00:58.980> up<00:00:59.070> as<00:00:59.190> well<00:00:59.370> so<00:00:59.399> they

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
personalities a mixed up as well so they

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.279

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
differently you know and they generally

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.530 
differently you know and they generally
am<00:01:04.500> they<00:01:05.250> generally<00:01:05.640> try<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.090> make<00:01:06.240> your<00:01:06.330> life

a living hell

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.859 
a living hell
but<00:01:08.070> each<00:01:08.280> skirmish<00:01:08.790> match<00:01:09.030> will<00:01:09.240> be<00:01:09.360> will<00:01:09.780> be

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.550 

so<00:01:16.490> deictic<00:01:16.910> in<00:01:17.000> 92<00:01:17.480> has<00:01:17.690> asked<00:01:18.050> what<00:01:18.170> graphics

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
so deictic in 92 has asked what graphics

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.560 
so deictic in 92 has asked what graphics
engine<00:01:18.860> you'll<00:01:19.010> be<00:01:19.100> using<00:01:19.250> priscilla<00:01:19.700> -<00:01:19.880> we

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
engine you'll be using priscilla - we

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:21.850 
engine you'll be using priscilla - we
can<00:01:20.690> tell<00:01:20.810> you<00:01:20.900> the<00:01:21.020> game<00:01:21.140> will<00:01:21.260> feature<00:01:21.290> and

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
can tell you the game will feature and

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.150 
can tell you the game will feature and
enhanced<00:01:22.670> vision<00:01:23.390> engine<00:01:23.780> so<00:01:24.410> we'll<00:01:24.590> be<00:01:24.710> a<00:01:24.740> 3d

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
enhanced vision engine so we'll be a 3d

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.470 
enhanced vision engine so we'll be a 3d
and<00:01:25.310> it<00:01:25.370> will<00:01:25.460> feature<00:01:25.610> have<00:01:25.790> it<00:01:25.910> physics<00:01:26.240> but

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
and it will feature have it physics but

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.270 
and it will feature have it physics but
the<00:01:27.050> main<00:01:27.200> thing<00:01:27.440> for<00:01:27.470> either<00:01:27.680> side<00:01:28.010> from<00:01:28.160> a

the main thing for either side from a

the main thing for either side from a
few<00:01:28.520> optimizations<00:01:28.790> and<00:01:29.690> you<00:01:29.810> know

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
few optimizations and you know

the<00:01:31.940> wall<00:01:32.120> destruction<00:01:32.630> is<00:01:32.720> basically<00:01:33.050> just

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
the wall destruction is basically just

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.260 
the wall destruction is basically just
to<00:01:33.290> make<00:01:33.440> the<00:01:33.530> game<00:01:33.680> run<00:01:33.860> as<00:01:34.430> smoothly<00:01:35.090> as

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
to make the game run as smoothly as

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.120 
to make the game run as smoothly as
possible<00:01:35.450> on<00:01:35.900> computers<00:01:36.350> big<00:01:36.530> and<00:01:36.680> small<00:01:36.890> so

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
possible on computers big and small so

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.080 
possible on computers big and small so
everyone<00:01:37.430> can<00:01:37.520> have<00:01:37.610> a<00:01:37.700> great<00:01:37.850> time<00:01:37.880> playing

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
everyone can have a great time playing

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.740 
everyone can have a great time playing
the<00:01:38.420> game<00:01:38.450> so<00:01:43.270> we've<00:01:44.270> got<00:01:44.360> a<00:01:44.390> question<00:01:44.540> from

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
the game so we've got a question from

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.440 
the game so we've got a question from
Jarmon<00:01:45.410> Kell<00:01:45.680> which<00:01:45.979> is<00:01:46.190> how<00:01:46.910> is<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.150> graphics

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
Jarmon Kell which is how is the graphics

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.969 
Jarmon Kell which is how is the graphics
engine<00:01:47.570> different<00:01:48.229> from<00:01:48.380> stronger<00:01:48.680> two<00:01:48.860> or
