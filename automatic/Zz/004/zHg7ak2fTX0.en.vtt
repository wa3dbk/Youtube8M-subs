00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.379
 oh my hell out of ammo 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.859
 crazy kitty quickly bring it 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.600
 letter, we urgently need more supplies to all 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.980
 hello with you spoons today we will 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.320
 consider which mod you help 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.810
 be able to increase your number of all 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.090
 minecraft weapons using this mod 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.070
 which I will consider today and all 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.110
 These weapons will have different effects and 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.480
 let's get started first I 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.270
 I will consider this to endure bombs this 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.430
 as you already understood by the name of the ball 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.930
 which explodes and more generally 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.879
 no features he has 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.100
 crafting it from one 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.200
 Ender porla and eight gunpowder you 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.570
 probably already understood how it is done but 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.300
 Still, all the craft you see in your 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.329
 top left in general we continue 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.820
 when we throw this ender bombs it is with us 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.000
 explodes so much that this little house 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.229
 he can tear down almost to the ground 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.990
 let us throw off now he's like 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.500
 in this glass this ender bombs and how are you 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.460
 you see 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.680
 and at home there is almost nothing in 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.860
 general as written on the site this ball 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.110
 takes down twice the damage as well 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.540
 terrain damage than a creeper or 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.580
 dynamite in general we throw it away 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.140
 we no longer need and now we 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.880
 consider this sword here 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.829
 called in dark sword 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.259
 and its especially lies in the fact that 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.430
 when we kill at least some mob 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.970
 or just beat him 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.229
 we are very pop-like connection 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.280
 They love to jump 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.680
 but we can help lazily jumping here 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.689
 as you can see we have such an ender 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.939
 sword we beat some mova and he 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.630
 which bounce so hard that in 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.119
 a fairy tale to say 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.439
 Pen describe for example a resident that you 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.899
 look at me like that 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.670
 sold some kind of garbage let's we have it 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:01.280
 kill 1 2 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.890
 about some slybryuga but in general we will start 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.570
 to the next ball and this is our battle x 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.509
 it can already be said to even have a 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.440
 simple ax what he does and he does 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.580
 what not to add any weapon from 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.400
 all mods that i ever 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.840
 considered slowing down for example on us 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.140
 any zombie I'm running 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.840
 By the way, oh wow, what are you all sly 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.239
 then a resident of a zombie and in general somehow there 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.709
 sleepy but it doesn't matter let's get straight 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.050
 Now we find for example this 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.090
 buried resident and try to hit 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.459
 it and near it's such will 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.200
 small balls these balls mean 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.970
 slow down now if you run 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.220
 some kind of skeleton or zombie we can 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.239
 hit him like this and he und sword 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.910
 will run on you 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.890
 very slowly but this effect lasts on 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.060
 all mobs in just 5 seconds so 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.760
 make no mistake 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.799
 so further we have such a sword here yes 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.049
 yes actually this is a sword people 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:57.799
 he is called of course a stick but it is a sword 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:03:00.019
 honest word is this stick in 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:04.010
 the features are that he is very good 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:06.260
 times he is well enchanted for example if 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.680
 wooden sword on the fifth level gives us 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.970
 only 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.400
 sharpness 1-2 then this one is the staff on 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.160
 Level five will give us these 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.140
 here are the effects you imagine but damage 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.820
 it is no different from wooden 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.450
 ball on let's proceed to the next 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.820
 ball and 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.730
 we have it excalibur excalibur 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.880
 awesome thing she kills everyone 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.560
 mobs with one hit but other than ender 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.209
 dragon of course for example we have 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.810
 the creeper who is running behind us some 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.940
 bad example he went blooper in general here 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.790
 even say there is nothing of all he kills 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:44.930
 with one blow even endermena 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.690
 we have nothing else to do here 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:52.430
 tell and we will proceed to the last 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:55.130
 ax for today is our scan in general 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.489
 what does he do very well 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:01.160
 kickback and repeat he sets fire to mobs aum 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.840
 as you can see it flew away quite far 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.269
 more precisely a resident and besides he is now 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.129
 burns like some kind of pathetic zombie but on 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.140
 In fact, this is certainly not a zombie and 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:10.520
 In general, all the craft were seen in their 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.840
 top left 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.520
