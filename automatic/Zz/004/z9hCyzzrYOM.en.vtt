I<00:00:11.099> was<00:00:11.550> gonna<00:00:11.700> do<00:00:11.849> an<00:00:11.940> unpacking<00:00:12.769> with<00:00:13.769> the

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
I was gonna do an unpacking with the

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.369 
I was gonna do an unpacking with the
sheath<00:00:14.070> but<00:00:14.280> I<00:00:14.340> realized<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:16.020> have<00:00:16.260> to

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
sheath but I realized that the I have to

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.859 
sheath but I realized that the I have to
do<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.500> little<00:00:16.650> bit<00:00:16.740> moulding<00:00:17.720> actually<00:00:18.720> take

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
do a little bit moulding actually take

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:19.220 
do a little bit moulding actually take
the<00:00:18.960> back

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
the back

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.689 
the back
it<00:00:19.289> wasn't<00:00:19.619> molding<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:20.220> little<00:00:20.550> bit<00:00:20.640> of

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
it wasn't molding a little bit of

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.720 
it wasn't molding a little bit of
modification<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.449> line<00:00:21.630> or<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.810> feet<00:00:22.020> and

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
modification to the line or the feet and

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
modification to the line or the feet and
really<00:00:23.730> with<00:00:24.119> these<00:00:25.340> plastic<00:00:26.750> thermoplastic

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
really with these plastic thermoplastic

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.169 
really with these plastic thermoplastic
aligners<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.619> would<00:00:28.800> heat<00:00:29.400> them<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.880> mold

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
aligners you would heat them and mold

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.420 
aligners you would heat them and mold
them<00:00:30.330> but<00:00:30.599> instead<00:00:30.720> because<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.529> how<00:00:31.740> wide<00:00:32.189> the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
them but instead because of how wide the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.660 
them but instead because of how wide the
blade<00:00:32.640> was<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:33.090> actually<00:00:33.329> had<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.719> cut<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
blade was I actually had to cut the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.709 
blade was I actually had to cut the
liner's<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.700> bit<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:38.180> I'm<00:00:39.180> sure<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.510> can<00:00:39.600> see

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
liner's a bit and I'm sure you can see

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:48.229 
liner's a bit and I'm sure you can see
that<00:00:41.329> yeah<00:00:44.300> so<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:46.460> did<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.579> but<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.879> fits

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
that yeah so I did that but it fits

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.290 
that yeah so I did that but it fits
perfectly<00:00:48.890> the<00:00:49.890> edge<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.879> blade<00:00:51.000> still

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
perfectly the edge of the blade still

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.860 
perfectly the edge of the blade still
contacts<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.110> liner<00:00:52.649> simply<00:00:53.460> cos<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.480> nature

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
contacts the liner simply cos the nature

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.590 
contacts the liner simply cos the nature
of<00:00:54.899> how<00:00:55.140> wide<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.680> blade<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.390> but<00:00:57.390> it's<00:00:57.510> still

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
of how wide this blade is but it's still

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.150 
of how wide this blade is but it's still
good<00:00:59.989> so<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.379> thing<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.680> pretty<00:01:01.710> much<00:01:01.920> ready

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
good so this thing is pretty much ready

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.889 
good so this thing is pretty much ready
to<00:01:02.219> rock<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.579> roll<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.210> will<00:01:03.570> be<00:01:03.660> taking

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
to rock and roll and I will be taking

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.929 
to rock and roll and I will be taking
this<00:01:04.170> hopefully<00:01:04.860> soon<00:01:05.129> out<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.519> woods<00:01:05.729> to

models I think to actually in production
now<00:01:24.270> because<00:01:24.630> on<00:01:24.990> their<00:01:25.140> website<00:01:25.530> they<00:01:25.740> only

Valley<00:02:10.860> sheath<00:02:11.190> was<00:02:11.400> pretty<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:12.360> was

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
Valley sheath was pretty that was

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.180 
Valley sheath was pretty that was
not<00:02:14.060> very<00:02:14.210> good<00:02:14.360> I<00:02:14.810> did<00:02:15.710> not<00:02:15.860> like<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.070> that

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
not very good I did not like it that

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.490 
not very good I did not like it that
much<00:02:16.220> at<00:02:16.490> all<00:02:16.640> which<00:02:17.390> is<00:02:17.510> why<00:02:17.630> I<00:02:17.960> don't<00:02:18.110> have<00:02:18.380> it

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
much at all which is why I don't have it

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.500 
much at all which is why I don't have it
anymore<00:02:18.530> and<00:02:18.830> I<00:02:18.890> sold<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:19.250> it<00:02:20.240> is<00:02:20.390> basically

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
anymore and I sold it it is basically

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.360 
anymore and I sold it it is basically
exact<00:02:20.930> campy<00:02:21.290> but<00:02:21.500> you<00:02:21.860> had<00:02:22.040> a<00:02:22.070> patch<00:02:22.340> like

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
exact campy but you had a patch like

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.750 
exact campy but you had a patch like
this<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:23.740> had<00:02:24.740> a<00:02:24.770> little<00:02:24.980> zipper<00:02:25.310> down<00:02:25.610> the

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
this and had a little zipper down the

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.150 
this and had a little zipper down the
center<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.270> you<00:02:26.450> could<00:02:26.630> unfold<00:02:27.200> that<00:02:27.410> but<00:02:28.040> it

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
center and you could unfold that but it

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.530 
center and you could unfold that but it
really<00:02:28.190> don't<00:02:28.460> give<00:02:28.550> you<00:02:28.610> that<00:02:28.700> much<00:02:28.760> space<00:02:29.240> in

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
really don't give you that much space in

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.440 
really don't give you that much space in
terms<00:02:29.690> of<00:02:29.930> holding<00:02:30.830> stuff<00:02:31.400> you<00:02:31.640> could<00:02:31.790> sort<00:02:32.360> of

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
terms of holding stuff you could sort of

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.810 
terms of holding stuff you could sort of
expand<00:02:33.050> it<00:02:33.260> but<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:34.070> means<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.370> zipper<00:02:34.670> was

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
expand it but that means the zipper was

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.970 
expand it but that means the zipper was
undone<00:02:35.210> and<00:02:35.630> usually<00:02:36.170> when<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.350> was<00:02:36.470> expanded

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
undone and usually when it was expanded

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.150 
undone and usually when it was expanded
the<00:02:37.810> nylon<00:02:38.810> strap<00:02:39.170> that<00:02:39.440> was<00:02:39.620> supposed<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:39.980> go

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
the nylon strap that was supposed to go

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.750 
the nylon strap that was supposed to go
over<00:02:40.220> it<00:02:40.400> usually<00:02:40.970> wouldn't<00:02:41.150> fit<00:02:41.570> and<00:02:41.830> so<00:02:42.830> that

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
over it usually wouldn't fit and so that

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.190 
over it usually wouldn't fit and so that
was<00:02:44.060> you<00:02:44.390> know<00:02:44.420> you<00:02:44.570> really<00:02:44.810> couldn't<00:02:45.050> fit

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
was you know you really couldn't fit

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.860 
was you know you really couldn't fit
much<00:02:45.350> besides<00:02:45.650> maybe<00:02:45.890> a<00:02:45.980> small<00:02:46.510> sort<00:02:47.510> of<00:02:47.570> Swiss

it wasn't it was kind of gimmicky in
terms<00:03:00.560> of<00:03:01.450> compared<00:03:02.450> to<00:03:02.540> these<00:03:02.660> I<00:03:02.990> mean<00:03:03.430> this

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
terms of compared to these I mean this

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.560 
terms of compared to these I mean this
is<00:03:04.550> the<00:03:04.640> exact<00:03:04.850> same<00:03:05.000> thing<00:03:05.210> and<00:03:05.330> they<00:03:05.420> also

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
is the exact same thing and they also

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
I was like okay maybe not maybe not the

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.270 
I was like okay maybe not maybe not the
best<00:03:10.250> idea<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.930> then<00:03:12.200> we<00:03:12.230> also<00:03:12.470> ii

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
best idea and then we also ii

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.740 
best idea and then we also ii
discontinued<00:03:13.670> model<00:03:14.000> was<00:03:14.330> the<00:03:14.570> navigator

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
discontinued model was the navigator

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.480 
discontinued model was the navigator
sheath<00:03:15.170> which<00:03:15.410> is<00:03:15.560> also<00:03:15.740> based<00:03:16.130> on<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.310> kind

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
sheath which is also based on the kind

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.330 
sheath which is also based on the kind
of<00:03:16.550> master<00:03:16.880> but<00:03:17.600> i<00:03:17.630> had<00:03:17.750> a<00:03:17.780> little<00:03:18.080> drama<00:03:18.340> right

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
of master but i had a little drama right

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.730 
of master but i had a little drama right
below<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:20.000> pouch<00:03:20.210> and<00:03:20.630> that<00:03:21.320> would<00:03:21.500> allow

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
below the pouch and that would allow

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.890 
below the pouch and that would allow
light<00:03:22.040> through<00:03:22.370> and<00:03:22.640> so<00:03:23.300> you<00:03:23.360> could

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
light through and so you could

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.980 
light through and so you could
essentially<00:03:24.830> turn<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.340> light<00:03:25.490> on

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
essentially turn the light on

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.750 
essentially turn the light on
while<00:03:26.990> it's<00:03:27.230> little<00:03:27.560> sheath<00:03:27.800> in<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.580> pouch

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
while it's little sheath in the pouch

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.610 
while it's little sheath in the pouch
and<00:03:29.090> you<00:03:29.180> have<00:03:30.080> a<00:03:30.110> little<00:03:30.350> bit<00:03:30.440> of<00:03:30.500> light

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
and you have a little bit of light

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.080 
and you have a little bit of light
coming<00:03:30.920> out<00:03:31.010> to<00:03:31.160> read<00:03:31.340> or<00:03:31.460> whatever<00:03:31.670> your<00:03:31.820> one

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
and so that was that was also kind of

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
grommet it allowed just enough light to

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.340 
grommet it allowed just enough light to
read<00:03:55.190> whatever<00:03:55.460> you<00:03:55.520> need<00:03:55.670> and<00:03:55.850> not<00:03:56.110> tamper<00:03:57.110> or

tools
and<00:04:19.930> these<00:04:20.260> fit<00:04:20.620> generally<00:04:21.310> much<00:04:21.520> better<00:04:21.760> than

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
and these fit generally much better than

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.600 
and these fit generally much better than
the<00:04:23.070> these<00:04:24.070> they<00:04:24.280> give<00:04:24.430> you<00:04:24.490> a<00:04:24.520> better

coverage<00:04:25.000> is<00:04:25.540> what<00:04:25.690> I'm<00:04:25.780> trying<00:04:25.840> to<00:04:25.990> say<00:04:26.170> and

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
coverage is what I'm trying to say and

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.320 
coverage is what I'm trying to say and
I've<00:04:27.010> actually<00:04:27.250> had<00:04:27.490> a<00:04:27.520> couple<00:04:27.700> times<00:04:28.030> were

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
I've actually had a couple times were

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.540 
I've actually had a couple times were
smaller<00:04:29.320> knives<00:04:29.590> thinner<00:04:30.010> knives<00:04:30.220> would

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
smaller knives thinner knives would

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.660 
smaller knives thinner knives would
actually<00:04:30.970> fall<00:04:31.270> out<00:04:31.300> of<00:04:31.510> the<00:04:31.990> sheath<00:04:32.670> because

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
actually fall out of the sheath because

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.230 
actually fall out of the sheath because
the<00:04:33.910> buckle<00:04:34.210> wasn't<00:04:35.520> the<00:04:36.520> buckles<00:04:36.880> can<00:04:37.030> loosen

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
the buckle wasn't the buckles can loosen

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.200 
the buckle wasn't the buckles can loosen
very<00:04:37.690> easily<00:04:37.870> compared<00:04:38.350> with<00:04:38.410> the<00:04:38.500> velcro<00:04:38.650> and

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
very easily compared with the velcro and

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.230 
very easily compared with the velcro and
so<00:04:40.210> yeah<00:04:41.460> other<00:04:42.460> than<00:04:42.550> that<00:04:42.640> all<00:04:43.000> these

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
so yeah other than that all these

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.080 
so yeah other than that all these
properties<00:04:43.720> have<00:04:43.840> the<00:04:44.290> split<00:04:45.040> belt<00:04:45.280> loop<00:04:45.460> and

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
properties have the split belt loop and

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.730 
properties have the split belt loop and
the<00:04:46.450> adjustable<00:04:48.150> handle<00:04:49.150> retention<00:04:49.870> system

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
the adjustable handle retention system

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.250 
the adjustable handle retention system
they<00:04:51.670> also<00:04:51.820> have<00:04:52.060> more<00:04:52.390> malik<00:04:52.690> malleable<00:04:53.080> and

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
they also have more malik malleable and

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
they also have more malik malleable and
all<00:04:54.100> these<00:04:54.310> drums<00:04:54.670> here<00:04:55.030> to<00:04:55.330> lash<00:04:55.630> paracord

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
used I've tried easing this as a leg

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.350 
used I've tried easing this as a leg
strap<00:05:05.310> but<00:05:06.310> it<00:05:06.430> doesn't<00:05:06.670> work<00:05:06.790> very<00:05:06.820> well<00:05:07.060> it's

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
strap but it doesn't work very well it's

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.530 
strap but it doesn't work very well it's
still<00:05:07.660> when<00:05:08.320> I've<00:05:08.440> had<00:05:08.470> when<00:05:08.950> I<00:05:08.980> have<00:05:09.190> this

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
still when I've had when I have this

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.940 
still when I've had when I have this
attached<00:05:10.540> to<00:05:10.750> my<00:05:10.840> leg<00:05:11.050> or<00:05:11.290> when<00:05:11.440> I<00:05:11.470> use<00:05:11.650> this<00:05:11.770> as

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
attached to my leg or when I use this as

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.120 
attached to my leg or when I use this as
the<00:05:12.600> leg<00:05:13.600> strap<00:05:13.870> it<00:05:14.080> still<00:05:14.380> flops<00:05:14.800> around<00:05:14.920> a

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
the leg strap it still flops around a

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.060 
the leg strap it still flops around a
lot<00:05:15.280> and<00:05:15.490> I'd<00:05:15.670> rather<00:05:15.820> have<00:05:16.240> just<00:05:16.870> the<00:05:17.140> leg

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
lot and I'd rather have just the leg

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.410 
lot and I'd rather have just the leg
strap<00:05:18.310> a<00:05:18.340> little<00:05:18.430> bit<00:05:18.640> higher<00:05:18.840> so<00:05:21.120> yeah<00:05:22.120> this

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.420 
strap a little bit higher so yeah this

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.560 
strap a little bit higher so yeah this
thing's<00:05:22.660> kind<00:05:22.900> of<00:05:23.020> useless<00:05:24.210> for<00:05:25.210> me<00:05:25.330> at<00:05:25.420> least

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
thing's kind of useless for me at least

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.710 
thing's kind of useless for me at least
I<00:05:25.840> mean<00:05:26.500> you<00:05:26.590> can<00:05:26.710> hang<00:05:26.890> it<00:05:27.010> somewhere<00:05:27.630> if<00:05:28.630> you

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
I mean you can hang it somewhere if you

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.060 
I mean you can hang it somewhere if you
want<00:05:28.900> to<00:05:28.990> hang<00:05:29.140> your<00:05:29.230> sheath<00:05:29.380> upside<00:05:29.680> down<00:05:29.800> you

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
want to hang your sheath upside down you

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.060 
want to hang your sheath upside down you
know<00:05:30.190> as<00:05:30.460> a<00:05:30.520> showpiece<00:05:31.030> I<00:05:31.210> guess<00:05:31.800> not<00:05:32.800> relieved

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
know as a showpiece I guess not relieved

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.160 
know as a showpiece I guess not relieved
I<00:05:33.370> mean<00:05:33.790> some<00:05:34.060> people<00:05:34.090> I<00:05:34.330> guess<00:05:34.510> can<00:05:34.900> find<00:05:35.080> it

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.170 
I mean some people I guess can find it

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.260 
I mean some people I guess can find it
useful<00:05:35.260> but<00:05:35.590> you<00:05:35.620> see<00:05:35.890> here<00:05:36.130> on<00:05:36.280> my<00:05:36.310> DMC<00:05:37.090> G<00:05:37.240> I

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
useful but you see here on my DMC G I

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.490 
useful but you see here on my DMC G I
actually<00:05:37.630> have<00:05:38.470> it<00:05:38.650> folded<00:05:38.890> back<00:05:40.500> simply

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
actually have it folded back simply

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.980 
actually have it folded back simply
because<00:05:41.590> it's<00:05:41.950> just<00:05:42.190> it's<00:05:42.490> not<00:05:42.910> really<00:05:42.990> it's

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
because it's just it's not really it's

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.550 
because it's just it's not really it's
not<00:05:44.170> that<00:05:44.430> it<00:05:45.430> doesn't<00:05:45.700> work<00:05:45.760> very<00:05:45.820> well<00:05:46.500> but<00:05:47.500> I

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
not that it doesn't work very well but I

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.140 
not that it doesn't work very well but I
guess<00:05:47.740> it's<00:05:47.950> an<00:05:48.070> extra<00:05:48.340> option<00:05:48.460> if<00:05:48.730> you<00:05:48.850> have

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
guess it's an extra option if you have

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.680 
guess it's an extra option if you have
longer<00:05:49.510> legs<00:05:49.720> or<00:05:49.960> if<00:05:50.020> you're<00:05:50.110> taller<00:05:50.320> and<00:05:51.690> but

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
longer legs or if you're taller and but

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.450 
longer legs or if you're taller and but
even<00:05:52.870> so<00:05:52.990> you<00:05:53.050> actually<00:05:53.260> want<00:05:53.560> this<00:05:53.830> you<00:05:54.430> want

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
even so you actually want this you want

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.570 
even so you actually want this you want
the<00:05:54.730> leg<00:05:54.880> strap<00:05:55.740> in<00:05:56.740> the<00:05:57.220> middle<00:05:57.400> of<00:05:57.460> your

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
the leg strap in the middle of your

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.820 
the leg strap in the middle of your
thigh<00:05:57.760> not<00:05:58.150> around<00:05:58.750> her<00:05:58.870> knees<00:05:59.110> so<00:05:59.410> it

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
thigh not around her knees so it

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.470 
thigh not around her knees so it
wouldn't<00:06:00.070> really<00:06:00.190> matter<00:06:00.490> too<00:06:00.880> much<00:06:00.910> if<00:06:01.420> you
