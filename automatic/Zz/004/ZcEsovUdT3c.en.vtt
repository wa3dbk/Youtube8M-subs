00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
well this is another oddity that I found

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.029 
well this is another oddity that I found
in<00:00:18.599> a<00:00:18.750> dakar<00:00:19.230> market<00:00:19.859> this<00:00:20.009> is<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.220> king<00:00:20.789> we<00:00:22.039> made

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
in a dakar market this is a king we made

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.460 
in a dakar market this is a king we made
in<00:00:23.160> China<00:00:23.400> obviously<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.779> say<00:00:24.990> oddity

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
in China obviously and I say oddity

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.339 
in China obviously and I say oddity
because<00:00:25.980> when<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.579> look<00:00:27.360> at<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.630> key<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.169> is

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
because when you look at the key this is

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.230 
because when you look at the key this is
a<00:00:28.380> cross<00:00:28.890> lock<00:00:29.160> or<00:00:29.400> commonly<00:00:29.699> called<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.970> Zeiss

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
a cross lock or commonly called a Zeiss

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.390 
a cross lock or commonly called a Zeiss
lock<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.800> one's<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.009> little<00:00:32.189> bit<00:00:32.279> unusual

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
lock and this one's a little bit unusual

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.509 
lock and this one's a little bit unusual
here's<00:00:32.970> what<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.180> key<00:00:33.300> looks<00:00:33.540> like<00:00:33.720> and<00:00:34.519> you

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:35.519 
here's what the key looks like and you

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:37.030 
here's what the key looks like and you
can<00:00:35.670> see<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:36.089> thing<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.390> looks<00:00:36.540> like<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.690> cross

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
can see this thing it looks like a cross

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.860 
can see this thing it looks like a cross
hence<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.370> name<00:00:38.550> but<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.180> one<00:00:39.420> looks<00:00:39.809> like

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
hence the name but this one looks like

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.140 
hence the name but this one looks like
it's<00:00:40.170> bidded<00:00:40.589> on<00:00:40.710> three<00:00:41.550> different<00:00:41.790> sides

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
it's bidded on three different sides

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.380 
it's bidded on three different sides
five<00:00:42.750> pins<00:00:43.140> per<00:00:43.440> side<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.370> till<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.640> 15<00:00:45.000> pins

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
five pins per side so till the 15 pins

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.049 
five pins per side so till the 15 pins
or<00:00:45.780> indicated<00:00:46.530> anyway<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.579> bottom<00:00:47.879> one

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
or indicated anyway and the bottom one

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.189 
or indicated anyway and the bottom one
is<00:00:48.239> not<00:00:48.780> pitted<00:00:49.260> that's<00:00:49.469> just<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.829> guide<00:00:50.360> so<00:00:51.360> we

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
is not pitted that's just a guide so we

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.650 
is not pitted that's just a guide so we
line<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.410> up<00:00:52.559> like<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.010> slides<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.149> perfectly

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
line it up like so slides in perfectly

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.420 
line it up like so slides in perfectly
the<00:00:55.079> groove<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.559> on<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.829> bottom<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.399> you

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
the groove is on the bottom so you

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.979 
the groove is on the bottom so you
always<00:00:56.640> know<00:00:56.850> how<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.090> thing<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.329> oriented

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
always know how this thing is oriented

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.920 
always know how this thing is oriented
it<00:00:58.289> only<00:00:58.410> goes<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.769> one<00:00:58.800> way<00:00:59.239> very<00:01:00.239> strong

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
it only goes in one way very strong

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.479 
it only goes in one way very strong
spring<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:02.010> thing<00:01:02.219> you've<00:01:02.340> probably

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
spring in this thing you've probably

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.560 
spring in this thing you've probably
heard<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.789> very<00:01:03.719> violent<00:01:04.350> shackle<00:01:04.920> wrist<00:01:05.570> so

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
heard that very violent shackle wrist so

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.600 
heard that very violent shackle wrist so
the<00:01:06.720> test<00:01:07.259> is<00:01:07.500> going<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.710> be<00:01:07.920> finding<00:01:08.490> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
the test is going to be finding the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.460 
the test is going to be finding the
right<00:01:08.729> tension<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.479> core<00:01:09.720> very<00:01:10.020> strong

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
right tension on this core very strong

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.330 
right tension on this core very strong
key<00:01:10.830> spring<00:01:11.670> nothing<00:01:12.259> so<00:01:13.259> anyway<00:01:13.500> for<00:01:14.220> that

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
key spring nothing so anyway for that

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.499 
key spring nothing so anyway for that
key<00:01:14.550> we<00:01:14.700> don't<00:01:14.850> need<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.119> we're<00:01:15.300> going<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.450> be

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
key we don't need it we're going to be

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.810 
key we don't need it we're going to be
trying<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.080> pick<00:01:16.289> our<00:01:16.440> way<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.860> I've<00:01:17.460> had<00:01:17.640> two

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
trying to pick our way and I've had two

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.600 
trying to pick our way and I've had two
failed<00:01:18.090> videos<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:19.039> it<00:01:20.039> all<00:01:20.190> came<00:01:20.369> down<00:01:20.550> to

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
failed videos and it all came down to

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.889 
failed videos and it all came down to
trying<00:01:20.910> to<00:01:20.940> find<00:01:21.209> a<00:01:21.270> way<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.390> tension<00:01:21.810> this

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
trying to find a way to tension this

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.760 
trying to find a way to tension this
thing<00:01:22.340> you'll<00:01:23.340> notice<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.729> cross<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.270> not

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
thing you'll notice the cross is not

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.559 
thing you'll notice the cross is not
that<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.069> lengths<00:01:26.429> of<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.849> legs<00:01:26.940> are<00:01:27.330> not<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.559 --> 00:01:27.569 
that the lengths of the legs are not the

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:29.419 
that the lengths of the legs are not the
same<00:01:27.720> dimension<00:01:28.259> my<00:01:28.410> idea<00:01:28.830> was<00:01:29.099> to<00:01:29.250> use<00:01:29.399> a

00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:29.429 
same dimension my idea was to use a

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:31.460 
same dimension my idea was to use a
tension<00:01:29.880> wrench<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.239> the<00:01:30.750> bottom<00:01:31.110> where<00:01:31.289> there

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
tension wrench on the bottom where there

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.350 
tension wrench on the bottom where there
are<00:01:31.649> no<00:01:31.830> pins<00:01:32.160> unfortunately<00:01:32.940> even<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
are no pins unfortunately even the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.600 
are no pins unfortunately even the
thinnest<00:01:33.720> tension<00:01:34.709> wrench<00:01:34.890> doesn't<00:01:35.429> fit

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
thinnest tension wrench doesn't fit

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.279 
thinnest tension wrench doesn't fit
there<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.569> I<00:01:36.599> thought<00:01:36.750> well<00:01:36.929> I'm<00:01:37.050> gonna<00:01:37.170> have

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
there so I thought well I'm gonna have

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.770 
there so I thought well I'm gonna have
to<00:01:37.380> use<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.770> top<00:01:37.979> or<00:01:38.340> one<00:01:38.459> of<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.610> sides<00:01:38.849> so<00:01:39.720> I

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
to use the top or one of the sides so I

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.710 
to use the top or one of the sides so I
wanted<00:01:39.989> to<00:01:40.080> know<00:01:40.140> how<00:01:40.259> far<00:01:40.289> the<00:01:41.009> pins<00:01:41.280> were<00:01:41.849> so

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
wanted to know how far the pins were so

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.900 
wanted to know how far the pins were so
I<00:01:42.750> started<00:01:43.440> feeling<00:01:43.619> around<00:01:44.009> on<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.369> left<00:01:44.610> and

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
I started feeling around on the left and

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.050 
I started feeling around on the left and
there<00:01:45.360> were<00:01:45.840> no<00:01:46.020> pins<00:01:46.319> nothing<00:01:46.890> on<00:01:47.069> the<00:01:47.849> right

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
there were no pins nothing on the right

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.109 
there were no pins nothing on the right
same<00:01:48.989> story<00:01:49.319> there<00:01:49.950> are<00:01:50.099> no<00:01:50.280> pins<00:01:50.550> the<00:01:50.819> only

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
same story there are no pins the only

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.529 
same story there are no pins the only
pins<00:01:51.420> on<00:01:51.569> this<00:01:51.660> locker<00:01:51.899> on<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.229> top<00:01:52.520> despite

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
pins on this locker on the top despite

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.169 
pins on this locker on the top despite
having<00:01:54.539> a<00:01:54.840> key<00:01:55.080> telling<00:01:55.560> us<00:01:55.679> otherwise<00:01:56.310> so

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
having a key telling us otherwise so

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.690 
having a key telling us otherwise so
instead<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.629> 15-pin<00:01:58.289> out<00:01:58.560> lock<00:01:58.830> now<00:01:59.489> we're

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
instead of a 15-pin out lock now we're

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.570 
instead of a 15-pin out lock now we're
looking<00:01:59.789> at<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.090> five<00:02:00.300> pin<00:02:00.509> lock<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:01.580> big

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
looking at a five pin lock so big

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.940 
looking at a five pin lock so big
Chinese<00:02:02.970> surprise<00:02:03.569> there<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:03.899> guess<00:02:04.170> happy<00:02:04.739> new

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.389 
year
okay<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.410> since<00:02:07.410> I<00:02:07.530> can't<00:02:07.560> tension<00:02:08.099> on<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.280> top

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
okay so since I can't tension on the top

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.859 
okay so since I can't tension on the top
I<00:02:08.580> got<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.819> go<00:02:08.879> from<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.060> sides<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.660> thought

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
I got to go from the sides I thought

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.780 
I got to go from the sides I thought
well<00:02:10.050> it's<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.590> normal<00:02:10.890> lock<00:02:11.039> I'm<00:02:11.340> just<00:02:11.640> going

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
well it's a normal lock I'm just going

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.420 
well it's a normal lock I'm just going
to<00:02:11.849> take<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.209> peterson<00:02:12.930> pry<00:02:13.110> bar<00:02:13.349> just<00:02:14.010> like<00:02:14.129> we

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
to take a peterson pry bar just like we

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.619 
to take a peterson pry bar just like we
do<00:02:14.550> with<00:02:14.640> all<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.910> other<00:02:14.940> locks<00:02:15.239> you<00:02:15.540> know

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
do with all the other locks you know

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.570 
do with all the other locks you know
Yael's<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.170> such<00:02:16.349> and<00:02:16.680> just<00:02:17.280> go<00:02:17.370> ahead<00:02:17.430> and

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
Yael's and such and just go ahead and

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.000 
Yael's and such and just go ahead and
tension<00:02:17.730> it<00:02:18.000> right<00:02:18.330> there<00:02:18.540> from<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.870> top

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
tension it right there from the top

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.740 
tension it right there from the top
so<00:02:20.550> that's<00:02:20.700> what<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:20.819> do<00:02:20.970> we<00:02:21.120> stick<00:02:21.330> it<00:02:21.450> in<00:02:21.540> there

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
so that's what I do we stick it in there

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.100 
so that's what I do we stick it in there
give<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:22.410> a<00:02:22.530> little<00:02:23.090> twist<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.330> overcome<00:02:24.810> that

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
give it a little twist to overcome that

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.190 
give it a little twist to overcome that
very<00:02:25.739> strong<00:02:26.099> spring<00:02:26.489> tension<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.750> I'm<00:02:28.080> going

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
very strong spring tension and I'm going

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.910 
very strong spring tension and I'm going
to<00:02:28.260> be<00:02:28.349> using<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.800> nice<00:02:29.069> fat<00:02:30.319> pick<00:02:31.319> this<00:02:31.500> 25

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
to be using a nice fat pick this 25

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.100 
to be using a nice fat pick this 25
thousands<00:02:32.569> because<00:02:33.569> it's<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.780> really<00:02:33.900> wide

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
thousands because it's a really wide

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.350 
thousands because it's a really wide
Kiwi<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.709> can<00:02:35.069> get<00:02:35.190> away<00:02:35.280> with<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:36.090> let's

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
Kiwi and I can get away with it so let's

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.449 
Kiwi and I can get away with it so let's
see<00:02:36.510> what<00:02:36.600> we<00:02:36.690> got

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
see what we got

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.590 
see what we got
try<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.520> find<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.880> right<00:02:39.090> balance<00:02:39.300> between

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
try to find the right balance between

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.040 
try to find the right balance between
torque<00:02:40.290> on<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.739> tension<00:02:41.100> wrench<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.970> find<00:02:45.959> a

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
torque on the tension wrench and find a

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.500 
torque on the tension wrench and find a
binder<00:02:47.120> it<00:02:48.120> feels<00:02:48.360> like<00:02:48.510> one<00:02:48.780> perhaps<00:02:50.510> oops

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
binder it feels like one perhaps oops

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.509 
binder it feels like one perhaps oops
well<00:02:52.200> maybe<00:02:52.470> not<00:02:52.709> let's<00:02:53.040> try<00:02:53.190> that<00:02:53.220> at<00:02:53.430> one

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
well maybe not let's try that at one

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.350 
well maybe not let's try that at one
more<00:02:53.670> time<00:02:55.310> you<00:02:56.310> can't<00:02:56.580> push<00:02:56.819> the<00:02:57.000> tension

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
more time you can't push the tension

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.789 
more time you can't push the tension
wrench<00:02:57.540> all<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.959> way<00:02:58.049> in<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.350> you'll<00:02:58.440> bind<00:02:58.650> up

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
wrench all the way in and you'll bind up

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.710 
wrench all the way in and you'll bind up
that<00:02:58.980> first<00:02:59.250> pin<00:02:59.549> so<00:02:59.819> you'll<00:03:00.299> notice<00:03:00.480> it's

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
that first pin so you'll notice it's

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.680 
that first pin so you'll notice it's
kind<00:03:00.900> of<00:03:01.080> just<00:03:01.530> barely<00:03:02.090> barely<00:03:03.090> hanging<00:03:03.569> in

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
kind of just barely barely hanging in

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.449 
kind of just barely barely hanging in
there<00:03:03.840> about<00:03:03.930> half<00:03:04.319> of<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.650> depth<00:03:04.950> is<00:03:05.160> all<00:03:05.310> I'm

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
there about half of the depth is all I'm

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.660 
there about half of the depth is all I'm
able<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.730> get<00:03:05.970> out<00:03:06.150> of<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:07.310> alright<00:03:08.310> so<00:03:08.340> let's

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
able to get out of it alright so let's

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:22.630 
able to get out of it alright so let's
try<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:08.880> again<00:03:10.850> okay<00:03:11.850> felt<00:03:12.360> like<00:03:12.540> pin<00:03:12.810> one

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:30.259 

okay<00:03:23.640> five

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:36.880 

to

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:48.160 

felt<00:03:37.890> like<00:03:38.040> three

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.449 

okay<00:03:49.170> those<00:03:49.349> were<00:03:49.409> not<00:03:49.799> those<00:03:50.010> are<00:03:50.159> just<00:03:50.280> be

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
okay those were not those are just be

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.500 
okay those were not those are just be
falling<00:03:50.849> off<00:03:50.999> and<00:03:52.370> Wow<00:03:53.400> cor<00:03:53.969> definitely

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
falling off and Wow cor definitely

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.289 
falling off and Wow cor definitely
rotated<00:03:55.109> a<00:03:55.170> little<00:03:55.200> bit<00:03:55.469> there<00:03:56.120> let's<00:03:57.120> see

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
rotated a little bit there let's see

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.849 
rotated a little bit there let's see
where<00:03:57.450> we<00:03:57.569> are<00:03:57.719> who<00:03:58.049> we<00:03:58.079> mission<00:03:58.590> who<00:03:58.709> we

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
where we are who we mission who we

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:04.149 
where we are who we mission who we
missing<00:03:59.510> ones<00:04:00.510> okay

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:11.240 

like<00:04:05.159> twos<00:04:05.459> okay

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.370 

let's<00:04:11.790> try<00:04:12.000> one<00:04:12.270> again<00:04:12.600> I<00:04:12.780> might<00:04:13.050> be<00:04:13.170> on<00:04:13.260> the

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
let's try one again I might be on the

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.020 
let's try one again I might be on the
tension<00:04:13.740> here<00:04:13.890> we<00:04:13.950> go<00:04:14.070> it<00:04:14.280> was<00:04:14.400> one<00:04:14.610> and<00:04:14.910> you

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
tension here we go it was one and you

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.330 
tension here we go it was one and you
probably<00:04:15.210> heard<00:04:15.450> that<00:04:15.480> slam<00:04:16.080> out<00:04:16.350> of<00:04:16.380> there<00:04:16.620> so

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
probably heard that slam out of there so

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.150 
probably heard that slam out of there so
there<00:04:17.580> you<00:04:17.670> go<00:04:17.850> when<00:04:18.060> you<00:04:18.120> find<00:04:18.420> one<00:04:18.660> of<00:04:18.690> these

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
there you go when you find one of these

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.250 
there you go when you find one of these
these<00:04:20.160> Kang<00:04:20.730> ways<00:04:21.150> don't<00:04:21.870> be<00:04:22.049> intimidated

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
these Kang ways don't be intimidated

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.620 
these Kang ways don't be intimidated
there's<00:04:22.650> not<00:04:22.860> really<00:04:23.430> 15<00:04:23.880> pins<00:04:24.270> in<00:04:24.480> these

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
there's not really 15 pins in these

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.570 
there's not really 15 pins in these
things<00:04:24.900> there's<00:04:25.080> only<00:04:25.200> five<00:04:26.010> and<00:04:26.370> you<00:04:26.430> keep

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
things there's only five and you keep

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.000 
things there's only five and you keep
some<00:04:26.760> pretty<00:04:26.910> good<00:04:27.060> tension<00:04:27.390> on<00:04:27.480> that<00:04:27.630> core<00:04:28.010> to

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
some pretty good tension on that core to

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.890 
some pretty good tension on that core to
overcome<00:04:29.370> that<00:04:29.520> spring<00:04:29.790> tension<00:04:30.150> and<00:04:30.300> you'll

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
overcome that spring tension and you'll

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.360 
overcome that spring tension and you'll
find<00:04:31.200> yourself<00:04:31.530> picking<00:04:31.680> right<00:04:31.980> in<00:04:32.130> there

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
find yourself picking right in there

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.950 
find yourself picking right in there
there<00:04:33.180> may<00:04:33.330> be<00:04:33.360> another<00:04:33.660> vulnerability

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
there may be another vulnerability

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.380 
there may be another vulnerability
shimming<00:04:34.830> but<00:04:35.100> since<00:04:35.640> it's<00:04:35.790> so<00:04:35.910> easy<00:04:36.090> to<00:04:36.240> pick

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
shimming but since it's so easy to pick

shimming but since it's so easy to pick
I<00:04:36.570> don't<00:04:36.720> see<00:04:36.840> any<00:04:36.990> reason<00:04:37.290> to<00:04:37.380> go<00:04:37.530> there<00:04:37.580> we

can<00:04:38.700> also<00:04:38.940> probably<00:04:39.240> shim<00:04:39.450> it<00:04:39.570> from<00:04:39.750> the<00:04:39.870> top

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
can also probably shim it from the top

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
might also be an option but again it's

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.640 
might also be an option but again it's
so<00:04:47.340> easy<00:04:47.520> to<00:04:47.700> pick<00:04:47.880> why<00:04:48.780> waste<00:04:49.050> time<00:04:49.200> pulling
