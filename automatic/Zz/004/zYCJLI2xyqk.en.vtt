you can see now with using pictochat I
don't<00:00:52.710> know<00:00:52.829> how<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.250> works<00:00:53.400> I<00:00:53.790> just<00:00:54.120> stumble

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
don't know how it works I just stumble

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:15.660 
don't know how it works I just stumble
upon<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.809> oh<00:00:57.620> you<00:00:58.620> do<00:00:58.920> type<00:00:59.550> in<00:00:59.760> unlocking<00:01:00.239> code

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.830 

and<00:01:17.700> then<00:01:18.700> you<00:01:18.790> put<00:01:18.939> these<00:01:19.119> little<00:01:19.299> weird<00:01:19.570> l

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.670 
actual computer code it's not really
hacking<00:01:51.600> since<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.930> already<00:01:52.080> know<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.440> code

hacking since you already know the code

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.390 
hacking since you already know the code
but<00:01:54.590> hey<00:01:55.590> Tyson<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.070> code<00:01:56.280> for<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:57.920> and<00:01:58.920> all

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
but hey Tyson the code for you and all

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.360 
but hey Tyson the code for you and all
that<00:01:59.550> it<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.820> hid<00:01:59.970> under<00:02:00.980> law<00:02:01.980> Mariana<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:04.370> don't

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.130 
that it is hid under law Mariana I don't
know<00:02:05.520> if<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:05.790> will<00:02:06.030> actually<00:02:06.300> work<00:02:06.570> on<00:02:06.870> any

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
know if this will actually work on any

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.470 
know if this will actually work on any
other<00:02:07.410> computer<00:02:07.890> because<00:02:08.880> mine's<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.450> little

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:09.480 
other computer because mine's a little

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.360 
other computer because mine's a little
bit<00:02:09.720> fancier<00:02:10.460> but<00:02:12.620> major<00:02:13.620> finding<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.040> USB

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
bit fancier but major finding the USB

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.270 
bit fancier but major finding the USB
cable<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:14.790> has<00:02:14.970> more<00:02:15.210> options<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:16.280> gives

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
cable that has more options and gives

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.580 
cable that has more options and gives
you<00:02:17.400> more<00:02:17.580> stuff<00:02:17.820> to<00:02:17.940> do<00:02:19.040> it's<00:02:20.040> easy<00:02:20.160> just<00:02:20.340> pie
