 at 50 rue saint blaise at lens on 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.279
 is the home of the Martin family 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.849
 holy Therese of the child Jesus was born 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.939
 right here 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:26.040
 little last of nine children this 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.899
 house was a place of joy for this home 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.730
 family and eupen lived in 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.850
 hope 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.789
 the parents got married on July 13th 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:39.570
 1858 where there were 35 years and zealously 26 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:42.359
 years he really had to consider life 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.940
 religious and he had wanted to go to 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:47.969
 grand saint bernard as wam 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.270
 and then it could not succeed it says 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.310
 martin is a 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.110
 young woman who poses a lot of 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.360
 questions about what could be his 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.340
 life and especially for example on a 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.330
 religious vocation is amazing because 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.100
 that it is at the moment of her marriage 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.540
 could imagine that like all 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.430
 young alençon girls she dreamed about 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.660
 to get married to have children there 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.010
 certainly still at the time 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:12.860
 before his marriage this form of life 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:18.020
 relatively tidy of a man animated by 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.920
 an ideal of faith and then she is dedicated 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.050
 to 7 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.530
 this passion that is his job the 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.720
 lace of alençon and finally its 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.430
 matrimonial vocation to the not know 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.530

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.660

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.860
 of the commercial part 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:11.670
 the link between delhi and her husband louis 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.290
 is a very loving link her husband 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.190
 she tells him as soon as they are separated 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.860
 two minutes 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:21.270

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:25.260
 said he looks forward to being near you finally 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.810
 we feel an extremely united couple ago 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.390
 a bond of friendship affection between them 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.530
 which is extremely strong and it shows 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.950
 on both sides in their 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.290
 letter 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.970
 how much their reciprocal distance 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.240
 was for them something a little 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.550
 few stressors in this home are born 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.740
 nine children 4 infant dies which 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.500
 was relatively common at the time and 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.360
 the five girls marie pauline leonie 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.990
 Celine and Thérèse aims in this 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.720
 Mons family put a lot thérèse 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.900
 despite his small age has a strong character 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.220
 she often plays on the stairs she 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.010
 was not quite three years old 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.290
 she imagined the little game a 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.420
 play for her to ride him from the 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.720
 go down by calling mom at each 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.620
 walking and mom who was working in the 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.510
 bottom room had to answer if mom 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.720
 did not answer the little one was moving 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.570
 more and keep calling and if mom 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.280
 answered a nice little word he had 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.040
 a march to win up or 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.459
 down and we start again is called 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:33.540
 mom then step there are 18 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:38.250
 we see the requirement of the little girl 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.560
 and the patience of the mother zélie martin 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.739
 is really an educator in the soul 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.920
 and I think these kids have been craving 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.460
 to know the Lord on seeing her 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.020
 live and see live 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.820
 2 that is, fathers and mothers who 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.210
 had the same intensity twice with 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.340
 each one his way of course to express it 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:59.920
 the family martin ink really his 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.930
 life in the gospel life of 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.540
 Christians to give up martin is a life 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.610
 very intensive that is to say that I 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.490
 understood in this correspondence that 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.260
 it's god first served and it's god 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.160
 first served at that time first 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.960
 by the liturgy 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.420
 they attend the Mass of Good 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.580
 hour in the morning she does novenas 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.220
 for each other it is 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.650
 worries about the salvation of others by 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.940
 example one moment we see there one of 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.310
 People working at home 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.960
 whose father will die but his only 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.880
 worry is that this man is 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.530
 confess before dying because she 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.270
 know that his salvation is in the hands of the 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.890
 priest who will confess 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.110
 it's someone who does things 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.060
 simply but who looks and who knows 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.140
 see 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.240
 zealie has a serious illness 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.850
 that will prevent him from being able to breastfeed 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.750
 children they will be separated from them is 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.790
 placed in nanny 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:53.350
 she is doing everything possible to 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:57.010
 see regularly celine did not do 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:05:00.600
 to weigh this suffering on those around him 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:04.330
 in his letters there are notes of 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:07.860
 of his headaches these words of 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:12.370
 breast she had breast cancer 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:15.370
 but this suffering she has exceeded 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:18.310
 and she continue to give a lot 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.790
 of attention to his entourage a lot 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.200
 of love to her husband to her children 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:25.030
 after months of zealous suffering 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.690
 receives the last sacraments surrounded 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:31.120
 by all these girls on August 28, 1877 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.520
 after a brief agony she goes off 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.010
 gently zealously died in this 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:40.760
 room in the same bed that was born 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:43.220
 Theresa she was 46 years old 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.900
 after Zelia's death the family leaves to 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.340
 lisieux join for the sake of 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.070
 children the brother-in-law and the sister-in-law 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:52.460
 louis the five girls will become 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:55.310
 religious 4 at carmel leoni at the 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.720
 visitation louis will also fall 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.440
 sick with a serious illness 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.390
 degenerative the martin focus is 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.590
 truly a source of interrogation 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:07.700
 for today's families 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:09.110
 how people of faith little by little 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:13.280
 learned 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:14.570
 to live this ideal as a couple and that 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.150
 it may be the modern side knows 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.010
 well how to be healthy in the world 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.510
 that's one of the strong points they've had 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.090
 to discover to learn 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:27.100
 the second is also how they have 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:29.990
 lived this ideal in confrontation 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:32.780
 many difficult moments in life 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.370
 whether it's the arrival of cancer that this 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.190
 is this brain disease for him 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:40.820
 even see as small entity are 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:43.670
 entered a trust let go 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.590
 an abandonment that passers-by announced already 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.840
 something of what therese will say if 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:50.570
 strongly for me mother of family 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:53.180
 the model of the family martin rennie 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:55.340
 louis and the five girls is a model 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.410
 at first very happy very current it is 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.210
 a woman who works is a woman 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.280
 which is open to the victim and the 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.780
 Lord at first of this life so 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.430
 who trusts him on a lot of 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.200
 things that avoid getting locked up 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.430
 we could have said go after the death of 

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.760
 four little she could have been of a 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:12.800
 sadness really focused on this evil 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.410
 and to say to oneself is the end of everything not 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.360
 everything she's really giving to her 

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.520
 children and she organizes she likes 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.260
 many small family celebrations 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.090
 she already counts in her head when 

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.860
 Pauline will come back for the holidays 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.600
 will go for a walk there it's not his happiness 

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.430
 first to go to the fair of alençon and 

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.300
 the little ones not really but she the 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.770
 does because she knows it's going to be 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.080
 the happiness of his family and his 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:36.670
 simple joys we feel the smile of 

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.670
 zealous on each of his girls 

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:42.479
 the good god gave me a father a mother 

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:44.960
 more worthy of heaven and the holy land
