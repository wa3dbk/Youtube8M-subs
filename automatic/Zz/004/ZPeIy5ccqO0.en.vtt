today<00:00:13.139> with<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:14.130> improvements<00:00:14.580> we've<00:00:14.700> made

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
today with the improvements we've made

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.480 
today with the improvements we've made
in<00:00:15.000> my<00:00:15.150> Ford<00:00:15.450> touch<00:00:15.509> sync<00:00:16.170> can<00:00:16.350> recognize<00:00:16.770> 100

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
in my Ford touch sync can recognize 100

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.300 
in my Ford touch sync can recognize 100
times<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:18.119> number<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.449> commands<00:00:19.020> so<00:00:20.010> st.<00:00:20.220> can

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
times that number of commands so st. can

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.010 
times that number of commands so st. can
recognize<00:00:20.670> 10,000<00:00:21.270> commands<00:00:21.600> for<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.840> first

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
recognize 10,000 commands for the first

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.960

one of the ways that we've improved the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.929 
one of the ways that we've improved the
system<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.710> we've<00:01:10.979> added<00:01:11.220> aliases<00:01:11.909> which

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
system is we've added aliases which

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.090 
system is we've added aliases which
allow<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.780> multiple<00:01:13.200> ways<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.619> ask<00:01:13.740> for

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
allow you multiple ways to ask for

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.280 
allow you multiple ways to ask for
things<00:01:14.250> for<00:01:14.760> example<00:01:14.880> with<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.930> climate

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
things for example with the climate

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.640 
things for example with the climate
system<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.860> can<00:01:17.580> say<00:01:18.360> several<00:01:18.810> commands<00:01:19.320> to

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
system I can say several commands to

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.950 
system I can say several commands to
achieve<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.009> same<00:01:20.220> function<00:01:24.740> climate

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
achieve the same function climate

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:35.050 
achieve the same function climate
climate<00:01:28.549> warmer

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:48.170 

increased<00:01:36.060> temp<00:01:40.640> temp<00:01:41.640> up<00:01:46.729> so<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.790> can<00:01:48.000> see

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
increased temp temp up so you can see

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.399 
increased temp temp up so you can see
there<00:01:48.420> were<00:01:48.540> multiple<00:01:48.689> ways<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.259> could

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
there were multiple ways that I could

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.539 
there were multiple ways that I could
increase<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.830> temperature<00:01:50.070> with<00:01:50.369> voice

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
increase the temperature with voice

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.850 
increase the temperature with voice
commands<00:01:51.060> another<00:01:51.720> example<00:01:52.289> is<00:01:52.440> with<00:01:52.530> playing

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
commands another example is with playing

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.910 
commands another example is with playing
songs<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.580> the<00:01:54.000> past<00:01:54.240> with<00:01:54.899> sync<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.380> had<00:01:55.770> to

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
songs in the past with sync you had to

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.920 
songs in the past with sync you had to
say<00:01:56.130> play<00:01:56.460> track<00:01:56.520> followed<00:01:57.240> by<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.420> song<00:01:57.689> name

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
say play track followed by the song name

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.350 
say play track followed by the song name
and<00:01:58.229> now<00:01:58.649> with<00:01:58.950> myford<00:01:59.399> touch<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.939> can<00:02:00.149> say

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
and now with myford touch you can say

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.399 
and now with myford touch you can say
play<00:02:00.689> song<00:02:01.020> or<00:02:01.470> play<00:02:01.860> track<00:02:03.110> one<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.259> great
