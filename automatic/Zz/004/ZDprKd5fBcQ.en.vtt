time and he brings the same energy to to
the<00:02:12.140> youth<00:02:12.350> youth<00:02:13.070> teams<00:02:13.569> it's<00:02:14.569> interesting

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
the youth youth teams it's interesting

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.770 
the youth youth teams it's interesting
to<00:02:15.200> see<00:02:15.410> how<00:02:15.440> in<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:15.980> first<00:02:16.280> exercise<00:02:16.780> the

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
to see how in the first exercise the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.720 
to see how in the first exercise the
boys<00:02:18.020> were<00:02:18.440> just<00:02:18.830> playing<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:19.250> ball<00:02:19.460> and

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
boys were just playing the ball and

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.809 
boys were just playing the ball and
right<00:02:20.270> away<00:02:20.569> when<00:02:20.900> he<00:02:21.770> brings<00:02:22.100> that<00:02:22.310> all<00:02:22.580> of

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
right away when he brings that all of

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.210 
right away when he brings that all of
that<00:02:22.970> energy<00:02:23.180> into<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.960> into<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.770> practice

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
a lot of energy and they he really can

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.930 
a lot of energy and they he really can
bring<00:02:31.700> a<00:02:31.910> life<00:02:32.150> a<00:02:32.360> training<00:02:32.630> session<00:02:33.050> that's

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
your position in your role this is how

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.560 
your position in your role this is how
you<00:03:30.950> can<00:03:31.220> improve<00:03:31.370> going<00:03:31.760> forward<00:03:31.940> so

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
you can improve going forward so

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.370 
you can improve going forward so
hopefully<00:03:33.290> take<00:03:33.590> a<00:03:33.620> lot<00:03:33.830> of<00:03:33.980> good<00:03:34.190> kind<00:03:34.460> of

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
hopefully take a lot of good kind of

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.070 
hopefully take a lot of good kind of
ideas<00:03:36.380> with<00:03:36.710> and<00:03:37.040> and<00:03:37.370> and<00:03:37.720> it<00:03:38.720> helps<00:03:38.960> them

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
ideas with and and and it helps them

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.660 
ideas with and and and it helps them
give<00:03:39.380> give<00:03:39.920> them<00:03:40.040> a<00:03:40.100> kind<00:03:40.250> of<00:03:40.370> a<00:03:40.460> guideline

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
give give them a kind of a guideline

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.890 
give give them a kind of a guideline
going<00:03:41.210> forward<00:03:41.540> because<00:03:41.660> eventually<00:03:42.230> all

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
going forward because eventually all

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.330 
going forward because eventually all
junior<00:03:44.900> national<00:03:45.350> team<00:03:45.530> players<00:03:45.800> you<00:03:46.010> want

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
junior national team players you want

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.360 
junior national team players you want
them<00:03:46.520> to<00:03:46.670> turn<00:03:46.850> into<00:03:47.150> at<00:03:47.480> one<00:03:47.750> day<00:03:48.050> into<00:03:48.980> senior

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
them to turn into at one day into senior

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.670 
them to turn into at one day into senior
national<00:03:49.760> team<00:03:49.790> players<00:03:50.270> so<00:03:50.600> so<00:03:51.110> the<00:03:51.350> earlier

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
national team players so so the earlier

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.260 
national team players so so the earlier
we<00:03:51.740> can<00:03:52.010> start<00:03:52.340> that<00:03:52.550> connection<00:03:52.940> and<00:03:53.180> the

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
we can start that connection and the

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.820 
we can start that connection and the
earlier<00:03:53.630> we<00:03:53.720> can<00:03:53.870> tell<00:03:54.110> them<00:03:54.320> what<00:03:54.500> it<00:03:54.620> takes

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
earlier we can tell them what it takes

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.740 
earlier we can tell them what it takes
to<00:03:55.010> get<00:03:55.130> to<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:55.280> next<00:03:55.490> level<00:03:55.850> I<00:03:55.970> think<00:03:56.630> the

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
to get to the next level I think the

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.140 
to get to the next level I think the
more<00:03:56.960> they'll<00:03:57.110> benefit<00:03:57.590> from<00:03:57.800> it<00:03:58.010> and<00:03:58.190> and<00:03:58.670> for

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
more they'll benefit from it and and for

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.740 
more they'll benefit from it and and for
us<00:03:59.270> coaches<00:03:59.540> that's<00:03:59.810> just<00:04:00.200> simply<00:04:00.440> fun
