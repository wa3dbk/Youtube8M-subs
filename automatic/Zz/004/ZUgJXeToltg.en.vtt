because<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.540> was<00:01:24.810> running<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.290> without<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.860> and

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
because I was running it without it and

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.969 
because I was running it without it and
it<00:01:26.100> was<00:01:26.220> running<00:01:26.520> like<00:01:26.970> at<00:01:27.210> at<00:01:27.780> first<00:01:28.140> but

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
run the top hose to the current to the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.080 
run the top hose to the current to the
breather<00:01:40.950> right<00:01:41.130> here<00:01:41.340> where<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.579> valves<00:01:41.939> are

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
breather right here where the valves are

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.450 
breather right here where the valves are
right<00:01:42.659> here<00:01:43.070> right<00:01:44.070> here

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
right here right here

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
and then the other hose run it from the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.399 
and then the other hose run it from the
carburetor<00:01:48.180> right<00:01:48.420> here<00:01:48.659> I've<00:01:48.869> seen<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.229> lot<00:01:49.350> of

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
carburetor right here I've seen a lot of

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.740 
carburetor right here I've seen a lot of
people<00:01:49.740> use<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.979> air<00:01:50.159> filter<00:01:50.549> but<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.329> doesn't

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
people use the air filter but it doesn't

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.370 
people use the air filter but it doesn't
really<00:01:51.869> work<00:01:52.310> but<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.729> just<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.840> know<00:01:54.869> use

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
really work but so I just you know use

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.870 
really work but so I just you know use
that<00:01:55.560> as<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.710> breather<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.100> know<00:01:56.369> hooked<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.820> up

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
that as a breather you know hooked it up

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.640 
that as a breather you know hooked it up
to<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.090> breather<00:01:57.390> setup<00:01:57.979> and<00:01:58.979> that's<00:01:59.100> it

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
to the breather setup and that's it

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.610 
to the breather setup and that's it
right<00:02:01.550> here<00:02:01.850> this<00:02:02.150> piece<00:02:02.600> right<00:02:02.840> here<00:02:02.900> I<00:02:03.290> don't

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
right here this piece right here I don't

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.650 
right here this piece right here I don't
know<00:02:03.800> what<00:02:03.980> it's<00:02:04.130> called<00:02:04.430> but<00:02:05.210> I<00:02:05.270> use<00:02:05.540> the

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
know what it's called but I use the

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.380 
know what it's called but I use the
regular<00:02:05.840> a<00:02:06.290> regular<00:02:06.460> just<00:02:07.460> hook<00:02:07.880> it<00:02:08.090> up<00:02:08.210> to<00:02:08.360> a

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
regular a regular just hook it up to a

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.940 
regular a regular just hook it up to a
breather<00:02:08.810> right<00:02:09.229> here<00:02:11.260> and<00:02:12.260> it<00:02:12.530> seems<00:02:12.740> to<00:02:12.860> be

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
breather right here and it seems to be

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.130 
breather right here and it seems to be
working<00:02:13.100> really<00:02:13.400> fine<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:14.300> throttle<00:02:14.720> is<00:02:14.900> nice

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
working really fine the throttle is nice

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.770 
working really fine the throttle is nice
it's<00:02:16.040> not<00:02:16.250> like<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:16.550> used<00:02:16.670> to<00:02:16.820> be<00:02:16.970> I<00:02:17.210> just

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
it's not like it used to be I just

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.530 
it's not like it used to be I just
barely<00:02:18.020> installed<00:02:18.530> it<00:02:18.730> I'm<00:02:19.730> using<00:02:20.000> a<00:02:20.240> stock
