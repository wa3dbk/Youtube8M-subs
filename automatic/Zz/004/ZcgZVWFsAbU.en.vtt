my 75 gallon I've got an emperor 400
Marineland<00:00:16.109> then<00:00:16.440> /<00:00:16.590> 400<00:00:17.130> filter<00:00:17.880> on<00:00:18.029> here

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.970 
Marineland then / 400 filter on here
when<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.170> first<00:00:19.320> got<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:20.010> had<00:00:20.400> two<00:00:21.300> baskets

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
when I first got it it had two baskets

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.109 
when I first got it it had two baskets
and<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.070> came<00:00:23.310> with<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.460> few<00:00:23.640> cartridges<00:00:26.119> and

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
and I came with a few cartridges and

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.419 
and I came with a few cartridges and
that<00:00:27.240> was<00:00:27.330> pretty<00:00:27.510> much<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:28.160> quickly<00:00:29.160> found

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
that was pretty much it quickly found

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.820 
that was pretty much it quickly found
out<00:00:29.670> buying<00:00:30.269> cartridges<00:00:30.900> for<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.230> or<00:00:31.380> spending

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
out buying cartridges for it or spending

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.280 
out buying cartridges for it or spending
I<00:00:32.009> think<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.850> was<00:00:33.000> like<00:00:33.180> locally<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:33.930> think<00:00:34.230> I

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
I think it was like locally I think I

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.310 
I think it was like locally I think I
paid<00:00:34.530> like<00:00:34.890> twenty<00:00:35.250> four<00:00:35.460> dollars<00:00:35.820> for<00:00:36.320> three

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
paid like twenty four dollars for three

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.930 
paid like twenty four dollars for three
or<00:00:37.530> four<00:00:37.559> cartridges<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.430> can't<00:00:38.610> remember<00:00:38.730> it

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
or four cartridges I can't remember it

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.959 
or four cartridges I can't remember it
was<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.090> bit<00:00:39.360> ridiculous<00:00:40.489> so<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.550> got<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.760> looking

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
was a bit ridiculous so I got to looking

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.500 
was a bit ridiculous so I got to looking
around<00:00:42.030> online<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:42.989> was<00:00:43.140> looking<00:00:43.710> at

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
around online and I was looking at

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.790 
around online and I was looking at
modifications<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.989> hang<00:00:46.500> off<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.770> back

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
modifications to hang off the back

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.060 
modifications to hang off the back
filters<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.690> I<00:00:48.690> figured<00:00:49.469> I'd<00:00:49.590> go<00:00:49.739> ahead<00:00:49.950> and

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
filters and I figured I'd go ahead and

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.680 
filters and I figured I'd go ahead and
do<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.219> with<00:00:50.340> mine<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.059> first<00:00:51.270> thing<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.510> did

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
do it with mine so the first thing I did

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.950 
do it with mine so the first thing I did
was<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.989> pulled<00:00:52.170> my<00:00:52.440> filter<00:00:53.280> pads<00:00:53.520> out<00:00:53.960> the

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
was I pulled my filter pads out the

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.439 
was I pulled my filter pads out the
baskets<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:56.309> sponge<00:00:56.640> material<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.300> was<00:00:57.420> in

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
baskets the sponge material that was in

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.720 
baskets the sponge material that was in
the<00:00:57.570> baskets<00:00:58.109> was<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.500> clogged<00:00:58.890> up<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.340> nasty

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
the baskets was so clogged up and nasty

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.450 
the baskets was so clogged up and nasty
that<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.329> was<00:01:00.719> back<00:01:01.050> feeding<00:01:01.410> water<00:01:01.710> over<00:01:02.309> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
that it was back feeding water over the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.420 
that it was back feeding water over the
top<00:01:02.570> so<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.600> pulled<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.049> out<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.619> what<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.189> did

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
top so I pulled that out and what I did

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.100 
top so I pulled that out and what I did
was<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.670> took<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.090> baskets<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.720> filled<00:01:06.960> in

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
was I took the baskets and filled in

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.320 
was I took the baskets and filled in
full<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.350> polyfill<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:08.070> didn't<00:01:08.970> put<00:01:09.090> him<00:01:09.180> back

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
full of polyfill I didn't put him back

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.870 
full of polyfill I didn't put him back
in<00:01:09.950> and<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.040> worked<00:01:11.220> pretty<00:01:11.400> good<00:01:11.610> at<00:01:11.729> keeping

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
in and it worked pretty good at keeping

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.219 
in and it worked pretty good at keeping
the<00:01:12.119> tank<00:01:12.360> fairly<00:01:13.049> clear<00:01:13.400> but<00:01:14.659> I<00:01:15.659> wanted<00:01:15.990> more

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the tank fairly clear but I wanted more

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.999 
the tank fairly clear but I wanted more
bio<00:01:16.890> media<00:01:18.049> so<00:01:19.049> what<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.229> did<00:01:19.409> was<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.650> looked

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
bio media so what I did was I looked

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.310 
bio media so what I did was I looked
around<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.610> could<00:01:21.000> not<00:01:21.180> find<00:01:21.360> anywhere<00:01:21.780> locally

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
around I could not find anywhere locally

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.620 
around I could not find anywhere locally
that<00:01:22.740> sold<00:01:23.130> ceramic<00:01:23.729> media<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.450> what

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
that sold ceramic media so this is what

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.830 
that sold ceramic media so this is what
i<00:01:24.659> did<00:01:24.750> i<00:01:25.610> went<00:01:26.610> ahead<00:01:26.670> near<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.390> baskets

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
i did i went ahead near the baskets

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.990 
i did i went ahead near the baskets
they're<00:01:28.080> full<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.320> polyfill<00:01:28.799> they<00:01:29.790> work

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
they're full of polyfill they work

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.730 
they're full of polyfill they work
excellent<00:01:30.630> actually<00:01:31.020> for<00:01:31.229> pulling<00:01:31.500> out<00:01:31.590> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
excellent actually for pulling out the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.120 
excellent actually for pulling out the
particulates<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.579> water<00:01:33.710> keeps<00:01:34.710> my<00:01:34.920> water

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
particulates in the water keeps my water

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.130 
particulates in the water keeps my water
pretty<00:01:35.579> clear<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.360> first<00:01:36.600> time<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.780> had<00:01:37.049> this

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
pretty clear the first time I had this

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.410 
pretty clear the first time I had this
tank<00:01:37.409> set<00:01:37.619> up<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.860> was<00:01:37.920> clear<00:01:38.220> but<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:39.299> know<00:01:39.390> I

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
tank set up it was clear but you know I

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.300 
tank set up it was clear but you know I
had<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> lot<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.290> particulates<00:01:40.950> floating

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
had a lot of particulates floating

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.499 
had a lot of particulates floating
around<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.820> actually<00:01:42.090> seems<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.360> work

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
around and it actually seems to work

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.910 
around and it actually seems to work
pretty<00:01:42.540> good<00:01:42.810> pulling<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.259> particulates<00:01:43.829> out

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
pretty good pulling the particulates out

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.969 
pretty good pulling the particulates out
so<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:44.880> then<00:01:45.090> cut<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.570> Plexiglas<00:01:46.110> drilled

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
so I then cut the Plexiglas drilled

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.039 
so I then cut the Plexiglas drilled
holes<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:48.000> can<00:01:48.240> kind<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.479> see<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
holes in it you can kind of see the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.760 
holes in it you can kind of see the
further<00:01:49.530> holes<00:01:50.040> or<00:01:50.310> half<00:01:50.460> inch<00:01:50.670> holes<00:01:51.020> I<00:01:52.020> do

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
further holes or half inch holes I do

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.889 
further holes or half inch holes I do
that<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.070> both<00:01:53.189> sides<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.790> then<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.060> put<00:01:54.329> lava

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
that on both sides and then I put lava

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.039 
that on both sides and then I put lava
rock<00:01:55.200> back<00:01:55.770> behind<00:01:55.950> here<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.869> like<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:57.990> said

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
rock back behind here and like I said

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.270 
rock back behind here and like I said
eventually<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.560> do<00:01:58.649> want<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:58.920> get<00:01:59.009> ceramic

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
eventually I do want to get ceramic

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.030 
eventually I do want to get ceramic
media<00:01:59.729> but<00:01:59.939> for<00:02:00.090> now<00:02:00.210> that'll<00:02:00.719> work<00:02:00.869> but<00:02:01.829> it

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
media but for now that'll work but it

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.719 
media but for now that'll work but it
works<00:02:02.219> pretty<00:02:02.430> good

there's<00:04:18.989> not<00:04:19.680> much<00:04:19.739> point<00:04:19.919> in<00:04:20.220> putting<00:04:20.400> the

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
there's not much point in putting the

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.630 
there's not much point in putting the
gravel<00:04:21.090> or<00:04:21.930> not<00:04:22.080> gravel<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.919> lava<00:04:23.190> rock<00:04:23.460> in

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
gravel or not gravel the lava rock in

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.700 
gravel or not gravel the lava rock in
here

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
here

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.770 
here
so<00:04:25.100> I<00:04:25.130> just<00:04:25.370> have<00:04:25.520> the<00:04:25.639> but<00:04:25.850> the<00:04:25.970> polyfill<00:04:26.539> and

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
so I just have the but the polyfill and

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.540 
so I just have the but the polyfill and
it<00:04:27.080> works<00:04:27.320> excellent<00:04:27.740> for<00:04:28.070> pulling<00:04:28.370> out<00:04:28.490> the

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
it works excellent for pulling out the

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.930 
it works excellent for pulling out the
debris<00:04:30.160> again<00:04:31.160> you<00:04:31.520> can<00:04:31.639> see<00:04:31.759> all<00:04:31.789> these

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
debris again you can see all these

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.180 
debris again you can see all these
little<00:04:32.150> bubbles<00:04:32.300> but<00:04:32.750> I<00:04:33.050> don't<00:04:33.800> really<00:04:34.009> have

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
little bubbles but I don't really have

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.960 
little bubbles but I don't really have
much<00:04:34.430> for<00:04:34.669> particulates<00:04:35.240> floating<00:04:35.539> around

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
much for particulates floating around

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.029 
much for particulates floating around
sorry<00:04:38.060> I<00:04:38.600> leave<00:04:39.169> that<00:04:39.350> algae<00:04:39.680> on<00:04:39.770> the<00:04:39.800> back

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 
sorry I leave that algae on the back

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:41.740 
sorry I leave that algae on the back
because<00:04:40.310> the<00:04:40.520> fry<00:04:40.759> actually<00:04:41.180> like<00:04:41.330> to<00:04:41.449> eat<00:04:41.600> it

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
because the fry actually like to eat it

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.840 
because the fry actually like to eat it
so<00:04:41.990> I<00:04:42.830> just<00:04:42.889> kind<00:04:43.130> of<00:04:43.220> leave<00:04:43.370> it<00:04:43.520> on<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:43.699> back

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
so I just kind of leave it on the back

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.730 
so I just kind of leave it on the back

hanging<00:04:48.740> off<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:48.949> back<00:04:49.070> filter

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
hanging off the back filter

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.749 
hanging off the back filter
modifications<00:04:50.590> nothing<00:04:51.590> major<00:04:51.740> but<00:04:52.130> cuts

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:52.759 
modifications nothing major but cuts

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.670 
modifications nothing major but cuts
cuts<00:04:53.479> cost<00:04:53.750> a<00:04:53.930> little<00:04:54.020> bit<00:04:54.289> makes<00:04:54.530> a<00:04:54.590> little

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
cuts cost a little bit makes a little

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.629 
cuts cost a little bit makes a little
bit<00:04:54.800> cheaper<00:04:55.250> to<00:04:55.340> maintain<00:04:55.699> and<00:04:57.340> works<00:04:58.340> just

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
bit cheaper to maintain and works just

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.889 
bit cheaper to maintain and works just
fine<00:04:58.820> so<00:04:59.240> I<00:04:59.470> figure<00:05:00.470> might<00:05:00.620> as<00:05:00.740> well
