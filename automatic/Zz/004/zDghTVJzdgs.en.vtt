00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.459
 hello everybody we are in the mud the avenue follows a dozen portuguese 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.000
 in this series addresses the issues that generate more doubts about the use of rules 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.469
 grammar of everyday life 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.179
 doubts suggestions of topics and collaborations contact me 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:18.570
 by email 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.880
 to stay inside the new posts until September the body 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.759
 if you prefer to be a twitter follower 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.759
 It will be a pleasure to have a shot to learn more about the everyday brand 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.869
 from our language 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.869
 the recall is a result of using the trace 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.730
 endow them with the 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.580
 sharp accent no ms 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.370
 log in 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.370
 as I said 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.870
 but with this right that a gari of the en101 should be producing everything 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.270
 preposition 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.210
 Here's an example 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.640
 he left behind the car means he left the back of the car 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.620
 he walked backwards 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.470
 repercussion for 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.100
 preceding the word behind 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.250
 the bus passes behind the city hall 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.690
 since again 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.229
 even for that the body 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.229
 in this case producing the word behind 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.950
 Let's pay close attention to that. 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.260
 in some words of it the imminent crisis the practice and also writes 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.570
 with an acute accent on MS and despite what many have said it consists of writing 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.490
 drive 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.720
 in fact who also attended 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.550
 the green color 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.310
 if the word ends with rc 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.690
 the greatest symptom 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.140
 she recommends clearly marked 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.530
 we remember that our safety 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.540
 has nothing to gain 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.540
 compulsion and obsession 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.570
 it's no use staying 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.860
 Here's an example 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.860
 of using that word behind 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.920
 in the band's initial capital song song at the rate 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.430
 a month and a half day in Suriname and we ripped out sold mother's age 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:19.010
 wrong the defendant we are not dating a thousand tickets for boyfriend 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.169
 we leave here in the new song 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:27.079
 I put the word in brackets 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:28.849
 because the 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.329
 logically only heart of that song, right? 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:33.839
 I wanted a song 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:36.839
 by poetic license I can use 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:39.410
 orality spain 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.149
 write the way people talk 

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:43.620
 the purpose of music 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.629
 the police bikini 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.399
 is popularizing 

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:50.869
 obviously I can write 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:54.239
 I did not know but I put it in the anhembi park 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.449
 just to remind us 

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:59.559
 that the correct way is to stop 

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:02.829
 d according to the cultured norm does not exist 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.489
 everybody left 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.439
 the parents of the girlfriend he complained 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:11.529
 for the back on video show 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:14.789
 abandoned the April index of the year 

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:24.179
 apricot 11 and without accent is the third person present in the 

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:26.059
 verb to bring 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:27.729
 I write with 12 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:30.729
 this is the project referring to the government to bring 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.269
 he always wants to be defined 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.590
 she brings death to my god silva 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:43.659
 money does not bring happiness but rather helps the problem 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:45.499
 and then 

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:49.389
 always remembering I wrote with 11 are fulfilling place to bring 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.669
 so in a movie 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:52.909
 verbal form 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:54.849
 obviously 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.629
 I'm always referring to this action of bringing something punctual 

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:05.239
 leaving aside to see which simple heart song from 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.239
 dollar rondônia 

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:16.309
 No, it's nothing, it's not. 

00:04:16.309 --> 00:04:19.309
 nothing at all 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.669
 not 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.090
 tomorrow ban ki-moon 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.159
 a boyfriend 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:34.529
 the unipê 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:37.529
 the world 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.729
 we leave here 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:41.129
 Come back home 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:44.129
 to enter in full this cultured norm 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:47.699
 on persimmon feet never laid on breasts 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:50.699
 a fragile as 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.050
 an oblique pronoun 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.349
 So 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:58.879
 brokerage house I can never start like the boss herself 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.550

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.559

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:07.779
 but this cultured norm and I'm talking about a song a song a police 

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:10.349
 after having a poetic license 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:12.099

 back with a sharp accent in the air 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.620

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:42.139
 heverton 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:45.879
