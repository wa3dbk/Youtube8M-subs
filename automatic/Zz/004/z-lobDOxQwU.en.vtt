00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
if he can catch our running back then we

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.010 
if he can catch our running back then we
need<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.250> get<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> new<00:01:20.490> running<00:01:20.670> back<00:01:21.020> here

run down underneath so I've been running
that<00:01:24.900> tight<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:25.439> we<00:01:25.530> fake<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.920> fly<00:01:26.100> sweep

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
that tight in so we fake the fly sweep

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.660 
that tight in so we fake the fly sweep
and<00:01:26.640> then<00:01:26.970> run<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.240> down<00:01:28.340> now<00:01:29.340> here's<00:01:29.549> an

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
and then run the down now here's an

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.340 
and then run the down now here's an
example<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:30.119> an<00:01:30.210> interior<00:01:30.570> diliman<00:01:31.079> who<00:01:31.170> does

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
example of an interior diliman who does

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.749 
example of an interior diliman who does
catch<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.740> fly<00:01:31.890> sweeper<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.430> if<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:32.610> was

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
catch the fly sweeper so if this was

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.069 
catch the fly sweeper so if this was
happening<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.210> either<00:01:33.600> look<00:01:33.810> at<00:01:33.960> your

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
happening you either look at your

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.539 
happening you either look at your
running<00:01:34.290> back<00:01:34.439> speed<00:01:34.740> or<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.250> gonna<00:01:35.310> have<00:01:35.430> to

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
running back speed or you gonna have to

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.510 
running back speed or you gonna have to
adjust<00:01:35.640> your<00:01:35.939> blocking<00:01:36.420> scheme<00:01:37.400> here<00:01:38.400> going

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
adjust your blocking scheme here going

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.800 
adjust your blocking scheme here going
to<00:01:38.579> run<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.790> fly<00:01:38.970> sweep<00:01:39.210> or<00:01:39.420> what<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.600> call

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
to run the fly sweep or what I call

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.630 
to run the fly sweep or what I call
doubles<00:01:40.259> formation<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:40.860> got<00:01:41.070> both<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.400> X

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
doubles formation so you got both the X

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.429 
doubles formation so you got both the X
and<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.970> y<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.479> got<00:01:42.659> both<00:01:42.810> split<00:01:43.049> ends<00:01:43.229> on<00:01:43.350> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
and the y you got both split ends on the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.200 
and the y you got both split ends on the
same<00:01:43.470> side<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.159> obviously<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.880> gives<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.119> the

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
same side so obviously it gives you the

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.789 
same side so obviously it gives you the
extra<00:01:45.270> blockers<00:01:45.780> but<00:01:45.960> what<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.170> does<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.619> it

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
extra blockers but what it does is it

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.230 
extra blockers but what it does is it
forces<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.280> outside<00:01:47.640> linebacker<00:01:48.030> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
forces the outside linebacker the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.960 
forces the outside linebacker the
number-four<00:01:48.600> defender<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.530> wide<00:01:49.770> now<00:01:50.070> he

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
number-four defender to wide now he

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.700 
number-four defender to wide now he
still<00:01:51.240> got<00:01:51.390> contained<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.170> opens<00:01:52.439> up<00:01:52.590> this

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
still got contained so it opens up this

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.340 
still got contained so it opens up this
alley<00:01:53.009> for<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.399> fly<00:01:53.610> sweeper<00:01:54.170> here's<00:01:55.170> my

when he opened pivoted he would actually

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.350 
when he opened pivoted he would actually
