00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.629
 I am in good health you know 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.629
 why because I have cats 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.430
 if you already have everything like me 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.750
 know that it is very difficult to 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.420
 resist these little balls of hair 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.820
 a single look and they make you melt 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.170
 literally for proof we have 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.670
 four at home because we 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.679
 could not resign ourselves to the 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.210
 leave out abandoned of all and 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.829
 even if I listened to my place 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.360
 would be noah's ark but hey it's not 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.559
 the subject of the video to see a cat 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.570
 it's very good for your health 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.370
 good except when you are allergic well 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.050
 sure recoil for example where we cherish when 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.379
 he was small he was allergic to 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.969
 cats and since we have four cats his 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.530
 allergy has virtually disappeared 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.969
 speaking of allergy is what you 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.829
 know what makes us allergic to 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.629
 cats these are not hairs like 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.620
 many people may think so but 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.870
 rather his saliva 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.940
 indeed the cat when he goes to wash there 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.870
 will spread on his hair a protein 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.180
 the call of the 1 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.010
 that's what makes us allergic good at 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.780
 share this unfortunate inconvenience the 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.560
 cat company is still very 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.390
 good for health 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.070
 some studies have shown that 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.990
 company of a cat was beneficial for 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.850
 sick people like for example 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.470
 people who have suffered myocardial infarction 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.729
 psychiatric pathologies or 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.470
 of high blood pressure 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.030
 the reasons are all simple the fact 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.700
 to caress her cat or to watch it 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.380
 allows to regulate our breathing and 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.310
 our heart rate but also of 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.049
 defend our muscles 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.640
 no but it's true when we look at a 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.930
 cat having fun with his toy or so 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.549
 with another colleague 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.650
 we can not help but smile or 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.700
 even laugh out loud and know that 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.780
 fuck the mouth of her pussy 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.310
 greatly improves our health when we 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.869
 laughs at his cat we teens get 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.460
 contracts and works as in the hall 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.869
 gym and that's good because I 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.280
 I do not like the gym helps us 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.960
 also to sleep better since when we 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.759
 laughs at him our brain secretes 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.149
 Serotonin also called the hormone 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.800
 sleep 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.120
 another study has shown 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.440
 the cats were very effective for 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.600
 people in situations of 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.850
 reintegration former detainee for example 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.800
 who owned a cat since he 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.360
 help to reintegrate into society 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.890
 so we can say that cats are from 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.330
 very good mediator when I wrote 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.370
 this chronicle I asked myself a 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.550
 another existential question that you 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.720
 you may be asking why 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.460
 the cats a pile time the boxes in 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.900
 cardboard no but it's true when I 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.760
 receive a package and I leave the 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.080
 you can be sure that 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.540
 five minutes later there is a cat who 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.040
 sleep in so suddenly I made some 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.900
 research and I discovered that it was 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.520
 because of their wild instincts in 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.410
 nature felines have to hide 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.510
 to hunt and this cardboard reminds them 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.910
 the hiding places that their ancestors had 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.260
 there they can observe without being seen or 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.610
 almost never seen a cat the hen and 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.380
 was not just that the boxes in 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.630
 cardboard gives them a sense of 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.560
 safety and comfort like us when 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.060
 we are in our quilt 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.500
 while it's raining outside before 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.210
 finish I wanted to advise you to 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.160
 books about cats that I was offered 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.550
 and which are by no means an investment 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.890
 product 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.050
