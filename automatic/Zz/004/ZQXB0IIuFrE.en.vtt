00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.139
 Mülheim 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.970
 we are extremely difficult at the state level has 20 seconds 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.400
 because on average 5000 euros per second makes the bottom line 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.469
 a lot of energy Cottbus 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.930
 Somebody should say again in the prayer Chopin 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.550
 however, the front lines are a little different than the first 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.950
 Apparently, on one hand we have fish without players and clearly 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.400
 on the other the tournament games 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.520
 let me distract from the topic during short trips 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.990
 namely, in the German Internet, there is still another group 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.900
 players 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.900
 the so-called not to play anymore 

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:22.979
 which one can already recognize by the slightly idiosyncratic notation 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.639
 This group has a few other hobbies, such as Strotbek 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.620
 or tourism 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.330
 Med we better not talk far 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.250
 back to the actual topic 8 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.400
 As you can see everything is still in the green area what we lack is one 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.550
 third group not 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.060
 the red n percent only by them there is no problem at all 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.680
 Admittedly, that is extremely simplified now 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.730
 Correctly, it would probably be more like I was in each of us 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.290
 small region is stuck 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.070
 On the other hand, the numbers slowly so complicated that the practical use 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.950
 stays on the track 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.179
 although it should already be clear to us that this topic because not least 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.919
 my employees indicated 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:16.439
 after all, the card is angular the attention span is one 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:17.729
 half a hour 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:19.090
 and that's why 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.090
 is from the war 

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:27.619
 next topic there or what will become of it 

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:30.809
 Aachen 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.529
 they had this one looks it 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:15.919
 as dire advised that sets the diabolical Street Regensburg has that 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:18.919
 have searched wide in Moscow 

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:23.929
 s 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.859
 s 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:32.930
 It is a bit of a pity that no new Innsbruckers are out 

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:37.439
 Leather technically it makes no sense also makes great sense 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:39.829
 to take the list counterpart to the purchase 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.889
 which in this case would have to marvel at the video 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:48.969
 Here you can see how to use it 

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:53.559
 and how not 

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:55.759
 Ott 

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:58.759
 Lady is 

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:04.379
 also fit perfectly into the world of Shadow only Schwerin 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.140
 With this one is certainly already encountered in real life he is white 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.409
 Of course, this is one of hell's most malignant Aberrants 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:12.589
 commencement 

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:14.309
 at least for Matic 

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:18.630
 is this a warning here is mainly a combination with China's plasma suit 

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:22.069
 It was allowed again and again three cats goats 

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:25.889
 if you have to draw your whole one you already have your ideas 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.419
 For example, in the conflict, you can only deal with it completely 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:36.099
 to be unnecessarily daily made just as vulnerable just SAP 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:38.300
 is in the gate 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.300
 One will throw off nine countries, yes 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:46.580
 Knee Testing Competition and Morale 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.190
 highly philosophical and of course, of course 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:55.020
 saving little is at the following discussion was about in the first place 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.740
 Respect or you could probably look at it from respect or addresses casting 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.039
 speak 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:04.709
 in each case in relation to sporty and unsportsmanlike behavior 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:10.479
 today's discussion a bit the proportionality is important » 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:15.669
 Take, for example, this obvious guessed it is 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.860
 described behavior maybe a bit over sporty area 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.909
 But certainly not so far that one the alleged offender of the 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:23.779
 measures list 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:27.919
 there is much worse the unsportsmanlike foul against the banks 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.059
 could 

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:34.599
 Question: what does this picture show us a demigod? 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:37.599
 it is save 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.860
 and then there was 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.469
 a scientific treatise on tropical group stands 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:50.810
 is very quite a lot of chapels and sick 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.130
 So I found each title years old 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.890
 Way to the destination quite interesting even if this destination namely a 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.160
 not really delivering practical answer to the questions asked 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.930
 he is reminded me of a joke Cannes 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.880
 takes the lead two churchgoers are on the way with the hot air balloon and 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.370
 have ruled one says the one glued 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.610
 CBOE it will be 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.460
 Coulton 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.789
 I thank you 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:28.830
 thank you 

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:31.379
 and asking where they are 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:34.270
 Op the human thinks superior 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.270
 I think a bit more finally answer 

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:42.029
 in a balloon 

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:43.860
 The two are disappointed 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.590
 after a brief moment of silence but that one 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.909
 Love and seals play 

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:51.919
 the 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:54.619
 SID 

00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:55.330
 2 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.150
 it relieves it 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.349
 Tel

 Century but you could thank Haupter 

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:12.780
 the water should 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.510
 until next time I would continue in the dark Florian a
