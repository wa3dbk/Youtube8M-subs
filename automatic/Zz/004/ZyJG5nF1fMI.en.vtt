00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.530
 modellbau king.de today donor not the 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.830
 bubble roads a climate swimming 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.689
 swim for this green monster 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.210
 timely creates creates a 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.910
 2.4 gigahertz speed floor is mine 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.910
 ripping speed it's doubted centimeters 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.039
 long rear propeller 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.240
 otherwise you do not need one 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.940
 Land does not make any sense either 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.519
 fun but here adjustable track stood 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.769
 so that was just falling in the water 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:39.309
 also just and that starts just normal 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:43.000
 rudder 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:45.040
 we have a small table doing a 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.559
 exhibitor beautiful in the shelf 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.370
 can a stowage is doing this 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:53.589
 lipo battery with 2002 milliampere otherwise 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.720
 we still have a replacement mother remains 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:59.500
 while a rotor blade to score a goal 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:03.720
 apella still two inbus keys to 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:06.490
 attach the playpen or even to the 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.159
 attach the track I always saw 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:13.330
 to know we are real now 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.890
 loose so the choice we have one 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.740
 open small screw or calories 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.320
 can even peek moussa camara was 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.880
 a bit closer I stop 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.479
 a bit okan there could be one 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.280
 see a little bit 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.710
 we have the porsches motor third 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.829
 with its own cooling and then behind the 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:33.039
 balls to the propeller here a page 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:34.270
 We have the receiver in it and you 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.240
 can see bad now I 'll go get it 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.179
 out only climbed on the but the 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.759
 Regulator in who is also water cooled 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:44.679
 as you can see the back side is good 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.719
 the one velcro band you have to do a bit 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.939
 shove 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:51.549
 then he just gets chained like that 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:55.179
 then he just has a little one left 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:58.539
 holder for the holder a 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:00.399
 Collar with Velcro for the battery can 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.770
 you then just put it in purely 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.630
 Climbing rose through the area 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.710
 otherwise there is still a very well inside 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.750
 otherwise you do not need a brother 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.960
 More stuff to say we pack the things 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.670
 was nice one on and off switch is 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.920
 it has not been wrong 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.470
 take out acquired on and off switch 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.269
 is not there the war contact if 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.620
 you just put it together 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.239
 can do a dry exercise 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:32.700
 now he has heard contact also 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.500
 How many great brands do this 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.579
 Let 's just give it a go 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.970
 switch on we have the light 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:43.620
 Illuminate the oar on moves 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:49.310
 sometimes dry exercise with the 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.310
 propeller it but about quarter gas 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.319
 I can not call that writes 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.330
 whole thing to move on and how 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.890
 that on the water i show you 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.160
 I have to do it for you first 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.530
 reassemble 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.629
 Cover on the back of the screw with it 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.120
 the lid also stays nice then go 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:13.099
 Let's have it as water and show you 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.519
 how the thing looks on the water 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:18.580
 the sequence man heavy game with you 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.580
 now 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.440
 so again and again says after the 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.330
 water industry clean again dare 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.160
 put down or body that too great 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.260
 post them on shelf looks great 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.560
 I need 25 centimeters of space 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.570
 I think also said that before 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.250
 otherwise you can also have a safe on 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.110
 flow does not matter 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.880
 in the bathtub one called just a lot 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.460
 place but everywhere else where water 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.709
 Can you find the thing very well even 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.280
 water gear makes a lot of fun and fun 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.260
 straight at the speed 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.820
 that really lures me what I have to tell you 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.380
 I like to do it again and again 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.630
 unfortunately battery empty faster 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:32.190
 I just say where does he get the hottest 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.190
