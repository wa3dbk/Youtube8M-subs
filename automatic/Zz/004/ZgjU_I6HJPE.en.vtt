00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:25.419
 hi it's raft voice the video of 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.839
 updates to the case that gold and 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.669
 money 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:29.499
 indeed I remind you that it is 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.260
 I will have the pleasure of animating with you the 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:33.940
 webinar number 13 which means that 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.340
 I could not do a video on their 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.470
 on money so that's why are 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.720
 grouped together if you have nothing 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.520
 to do tonight at 9 pm and well I you 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.140
 give an appointment it will last a half 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.240
 time as usual and the goal 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.860
 it is to speak a little candlesticks 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.560
 Japanese 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.710
 I am extremely disconcerted by the 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.540
 candle of the day 1% rise while 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.370
 we were already delicately 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.790
 report to the same mobilization I was saying 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.110
 in previous sessions that we 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.579
 had broken the moving average to 20 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.659
 meetings on 20 November but since 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.509
 we still had not done our 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.100
 back on the wines our take of support 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.920
 on the n20 we had not done our 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.899
 pullback on the n go and that does not 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.100
 should be delayed because the coal law 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:19.539
 back to the m20 is a law ever 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.509
 denied at one point or nantes on 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:24.100
 back towards its long-term trend 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.409
 in this case on this unit of time 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.119
 it's the moving average at 20 sessions and 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.310
 we finally decided after having 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:34.200
 procrastinating one two three four five 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.090
 six to eight sessions in contact with 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.610
 from the top of the players bolline 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.259
 from the fork of blue andrews well 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.770
 finally we decided to take support 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.140
 on the 3588 to go on the assault of the 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.679
 upper gold coil then on the one hand 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.350
 actually this shows the extreme one 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:54.329
 good health of the cac who continues his 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.700
 progress but we are honestly 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.100
 in trouble with the trend 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.659
 in the medium term since once again the 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.850
 back on the n20 will take place at a time 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.610
 or another then as I left yesterday and 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.580
 the day before yesterday it's not about shorts and 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.140
 a bearish divergence as it is the 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.610
 case on the stochastic to look at 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.079
 still has not done any higher on 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.329
 the stochastic while we did some 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:17.099
 studs on the court so I was saying a 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:19.620
 bearish divergence is not a sign 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.180
 short selling of speculation to the 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.890
 down but it's still an alert 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.840
 and at one time or another we go the 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.370
 see this consolidation so if you 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.209
 buy them now to enjoy 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.670
 the uptrend 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.650
 it's logical but you have to know not go 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.090
 do old bones because the return to 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.079
 the real 20 aurelian at the moment 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.519
 Note when in solution I think 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.019
 obvious to the first obvious solution 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.609
 it's after contact with the 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.709
 resistance or constitutes the buenos aires 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:45.389
 superior second and well maybe 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.120
 that we are going straight to the 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.630
 the contact with the lens here that I have 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.329
 reported 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.090
 you know there is a w here a double 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.590
 bottom 1 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.299
 the goal is sought 3730 which 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.190
 correspond to pau taker of the w 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.470
 postpone above the water line 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.380
 so I do not know if that's okay 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.840
 directly search 3730 but in all 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.890
 case there is passion in maintaining the 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.560
 side 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.050
 gold and silver that's what we 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.709
 can say we start with the market of 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:19.319
 the gold we see we are at 1708 dollars 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:22.470
 the ounce with a symbolic drop of 0.2 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.790
 percent we did not manage to go 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.980
 search the moving average at 20 sessions 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.690
 today my has nevertheless bounced back on 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.730
 a mobile at this session after having 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.920
 past I still consider that of 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.510
 statistically there the most thing 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.340
 obvious that we should have a return 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.560
 on the m20 and there complicated things 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.910
 will start so we are below 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.370
 the n20 anyway we are in trend 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.400
 bearish what is confirmed by my 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.890
 surrendered who is under his signal is a 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.860
 tom moment which is negative all that for 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.050
 to say that there statistically there the 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.030
 solution the most configuration 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.100
 classic would be to go up looking for the 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.720
 l1 before making another leg of 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.670
 drop so beware before buying 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.019
 in any case for the moment we are 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.560
 always in a rebound situation 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.690
 technical 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.820
 we will notice since it is the objective 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.459
 of the webinar this is the presence of a 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:11.580
 bearish harami here heralding 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.870
 down if the candle following that of 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.060
 monday is a red candle 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.979
 we see that the body of the candle 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.690
 today's end of the session is not 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.010
 finished and that this hour but the body 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.810
 today's candle is included 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.680
 in the body of yesterday's candle it's 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.710
 a bearish harami 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.030
 we will finish with the money and on the 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.830
 money market things are 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.510
 even less engaging 1 since the 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.020
 decrease is 0 8% 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:36.740
 like with a ma cede that is under his 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:40.890
 signal is a movement tome that is 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.240
 negative we have not managed to pass the 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.850
 moving average to 20 sessions 1 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.290
 today we even finished below 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.150
 the moving average at this meeting so he 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.140
 there were clearances obviously for 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.010
 be careful it's a configuration 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.870
 happy money 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.130
 the n is not yet bearish she 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.020
 is still bullish so we're not 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.360
 in a downtrend as we could 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.560
 to be here but as long as we are not at 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.700
 above the n va one is certainly 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.400
 not in an uptrend 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.650
 so distrust for the rest we are very 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.420
 fragile in terms of metals and as to 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.690
 bedroom we decided to 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:13.450
 to opt for the leak ahead that can 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.930
 climb again but harder will be the 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.610
 fall 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.920
 here I wish you a good evening 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.640
 of your help if you join me and 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.410
 tonight the web there is mostly a no 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.300
 click on the button that consists of 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.310
 to say we must call this or that number 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.080
 since you do not need me the sound 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.780
 pass directly through the slaps you 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.890
 just need to connect with 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.510
 slaps and you will be able 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.890
 attend the webinar as usual 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.000
 to connect to which number it is 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:42.610
 totally useless 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.470
 good evening against her and see you tomorrow cmc 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:48.990
