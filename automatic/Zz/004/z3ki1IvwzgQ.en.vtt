00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.050 

and<00:03:19.510> we've<00:03:19.900> got<00:03:20.080> new<00:03:20.260> truck<00:03:20.670> and<00:03:21.670> there<00:03:21.940> are

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
and we've got new truck and there are

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:29.440 
and we've got new truck and there are
more<00:03:22.540> sturdier<00:03:23.080> I<00:03:23.500> think

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.900 

the<00:03:30.450> vibe<00:03:30.660> is<00:03:30.900> very<00:03:30.930> comfortable<00:03:31.800> there<00:03:32.610> was<00:03:32.880> a

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910

lot of space demo I think there's not to
give<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.430> everything<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.270> then<00:03:39.510> when<00:03:40.200> the

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
give you everything and then when the

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.210 
give you everything and then when the
new<00:03:40.500> trucks<00:03:40.830> arrived<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:42.350> tried<00:03:43.350> one<00:03:43.620> it<00:03:43.860> didn't
