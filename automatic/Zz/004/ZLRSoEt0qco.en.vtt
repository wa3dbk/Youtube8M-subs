results<00:05:57.530> from<00:05:57.740> the<00:05:57.950> FA<00:05:58.460> Cup<00:05:58.760> man<00:05:59.390> united<00:05:59.570> are

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
results from the FA Cup man united are

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.560 
results from the FA Cup man united are
through<00:06:00.260> but<00:06:00.980> Everton<00:06:01.550> immensity<00:06:02.150> have<00:06:02.270> to<00:06:02.420> do

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 
through but Everton immensity have to do

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.500 
through but Everton immensity have to do
a<00:06:02.600> replay<00:06:03.080> and<00:06:03.500> also<00:06:04.370> Crystal<00:06:04.790> Palace<00:06:05.030> Chelsea

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
a replay and also Crystal Palace Chelsea

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.390 
a replay and also Crystal Palace Chelsea
but<00:06:05.660> I<00:06:05.690> think<00:06:06.020> Chelsea<00:06:06.440> immensity<00:06:07.010> will<00:06:07.190> win

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
but I think Chelsea immensity will win

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.360 
but I think Chelsea immensity will win
the<00:06:08.030> replays<00:06:08.510> so<00:06:08.900> it<00:06:09.140> will<00:06:09.350> be<00:06:09.380> the<00:06:09.740> big<00:06:10.070> for

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
the replays so it will be the big for

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.550 
the replays so it will be the big for
Man<00:06:11.030> United<00:06:11.060> man<00:06:11.720> city<00:06:12.050> chelsea<00:06:12.290> and

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
Man United man city chelsea and

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.890 
Man United man city chelsea and
liverpool<00:06:12.620> most<00:06:13.280> probably<00:06:13.790> in<00:06:14.570> the

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
liverpool most probably in the

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.840 
liverpool most probably in the
semi-final<00:06:15.620> of<00:06:15.680> the<00:06:15.740> FA<00:06:16.190> cup<00:06:16.430> water

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:16.850 
semi-final of the FA cup water

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.750 
semi-final of the FA cup water
tournament<00:06:17.630> this<00:06:18.320> is<00:06:18.530> this<00:06:19.010> promises<00:06:19.580> to<00:06:19.610> be

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:19.760

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:22.850 
and also i think the champions league

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.660 
and also i think the champions league
draw<00:06:22.970> is<00:06:23.780> in<00:06:24.260> so<00:06:24.680> let's<00:06:24.860> see<00:06:25.040> the<00:06:25.190> results
