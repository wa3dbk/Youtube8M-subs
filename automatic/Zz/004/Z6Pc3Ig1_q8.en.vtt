with this DIY kit so we don't really
know<00:00:35.190> what's<00:00:35.399> in<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.610> box<00:00:35.850> at<00:00:36.059> all<00:00:36.180> we

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
know what's in this box at all we

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.330 
know what's in this box at all we
haven't<00:00:36.540> opened<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.840> yet<00:00:36.899> so<00:00:37.770> Matt<00:00:37.950> do<00:00:38.100> we<00:00:38.190> know

what's involved with that process at all
no<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.860> since<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.190> like<00:00:41.399> challenges<00:00:41.910> instead

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
no and since we like challenges instead

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.420 
no and since we like challenges instead
of<00:00:42.360> buying<00:00:42.510> one<00:00:42.809> assembled<00:00:43.469> we<00:00:43.620> figured<00:00:44.280> we

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
of buying one assembled we figured we

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.529 
of buying one assembled we figured we
would<00:00:44.579> attempt<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.879> assemble<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.420> ourselves

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
would attempt to assemble it ourselves

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.959 
would attempt to assemble it ourselves
but<00:00:46.200> we're<00:00:46.410> being<00:00:46.950> told<00:00:47.129> by<00:00:47.340> them<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.820> can

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
but we're being told by them that it can

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.549 
but we're being told by them that it can
be<00:00:48.120> about<00:00:48.390> eight<00:00:48.600> hours<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:49.110> put<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.379> together

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
be about eight hours to put it together

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.260 
be about eight hours to put it together
although<00:00:50.010> we've<00:00:50.489> read<00:00:50.670> from<00:00:50.820> other<00:00:51.030> locations

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
although we've read from other locations

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.510 
although we've read from other locations
that<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:51.960> can<00:00:52.050> be<00:00:52.140> as<00:00:52.230> much<00:00:52.379> as<00:00:52.440> 16<00:00:53.010> hours<00:00:53.370> to

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
that it can be as much as 16 hours to

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.729 
that it can be as much as 16 hours to
put<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.760> together<00:00:54.110> so<00:00:55.110> let's<00:00:55.289> see<00:00:55.469> what<00:00:55.500> we're

included USB cables this is part of the
balsa<00:01:25.590> wood<00:01:25.619> assembly<00:01:26.189> on<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.430> outside<00:01:26.850> of

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
balsa wood assembly on the outside of

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.420 
balsa wood assembly on the outside of
the<00:01:27.030> printer<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.450> as<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.140> can<00:01:28.320> see<00:01:28.350> from<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
the printer and as you can see from the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.429 
the printer and as you can see from the
burn<00:01:29.610> marks<00:01:29.880> it's<00:01:30.030> actually<00:01:30.299> laser-cut<00:01:30.869> that

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
burn marks it's actually laser-cut that

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.660 
burn marks it's actually laser-cut that
means<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:31.740> accurate<00:01:32.189> but<00:01:32.310> because<00:01:32.490> it's

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
means it's accurate but because it's

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.390 
means it's accurate but because it's
also<00:01:32.850> it's<00:01:33.119> also<00:01:33.299> pretty<00:01:33.630> cheap<00:01:34.250> so<00:01:35.250> that

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
also it's also pretty cheap so that

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.710 
also it's also pretty cheap so that
helps<00:01:35.610> keep<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.820> price<00:01:36.060> down<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.540> lot<00:01:36.659> of

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
helps keep the price down to a lot of

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.929 
helps keep the price down to a lot of
things<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:36.960> makes<00:01:37.229> these<00:01:37.439> ready<00:01:37.710> for

chassis of the unit the electric motor

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.020 
chassis of the unit the electric motor
assembly<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:52.350> will<00:01:52.530> drive

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
assembly that will drive

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.170 
assembly that will drive
the<00:01:54.440> chapter<00:01:55.440> of<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.159> extruder<00:01:56.580> head<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.880> also

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
the chapter of the extruder head is also

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.310 
the chapter of the extruder head is also
in<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.330> bag<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.080> part<00:01:58.290> that

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
in the bag that is the part that

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.859 
in the bag that is the part that
actually<00:01:58.470> injects<00:01:59.190> the<00:01:59.729> liquid<00:02:00.450> melted

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
actually injects the liquid melted

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.350 
actually injects the liquid melted
plastic<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.710> form<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.820> item<00:02:03.150> that<00:02:03.299> you're

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
plastic to form the item that you're

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.620 
plastic to form the item that you're
printing<00:02:04.190> so<00:02:05.190> this<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.670> Z<00:02:05.940> rail<00:02:06.299> motor

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
printing so this is the Z rail motor

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.410 
printing so this is the Z rail motor
assembly<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.350> Z<00:02:07.770> refers<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.550> axis<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.179> it's

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
assembly so Z refers to the axis so it's

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.600 
assembly so Z refers to the axis so it's
a<00:02:09.569> 23<00:02:10.289> objects<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.100> that<00:02:11.340> means<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.580> have

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
a 23 objects and that means you have

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.510 
a 23 objects and that means you have
three<00:02:12.060> axes<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.569> worry<00:02:12.690> about<00:02:12.810> x<00:02:13.110> y<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:13.620> z<00:02:13.739> so

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
three axes to worry about x y and z so

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.309 
three axes to worry about x y and z so
there's<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.730> motor<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.120> drives<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.870> extruder

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
there's a motor that drives the extruder

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.350 
there's a motor that drives the extruder
head<00:02:16.500> along<00:02:17.220> those<00:02:17.459> three<00:02:17.670> axes<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.180> that's

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
head along those three axes and that's

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.780 
head along those three axes and that's
what<00:02:18.600> this<00:02:18.959> is<00:02:19.230> this<00:02:19.440> is<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.800> z<00:02:20.040> axis<00:02:20.069> model

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
what this is this is the z axis model

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.600 
what this is this is the z axis model
the<00:02:21.360> calibration<00:02:22.080> of<00:02:22.230> this<00:02:22.560> is<00:02:22.890> what's<00:02:23.400> very

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
the calibration of this is what's very

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.520 
the calibration of this is what's very
critical<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.300> make<00:02:24.480> in<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.870> end<00:02:24.989> to<00:02:25.170> making

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
critical to make in the end to making

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.650 
critical to make in the end to making
sure<00:02:25.709> that<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.040> object<00:02:26.580> comes<00:02:26.970> out<00:02:27.209> exactly

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
sure that the object comes out exactly

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.470 
sure that the object comes out exactly
as<00:02:27.870> desired<00:02:28.260> I'm<00:02:28.680> for<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:28.980> Y<00:02:29.250> rail<00:02:29.550> yes<00:02:30.300> sir

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
as desired I'm for the Y rail yes sir

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.930 
as desired I'm for the Y rail yes sir
probably<00:02:31.350> looks<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.590> lot<00:02:31.709> like<00:02:31.860> 20<00:02:32.340> I'll<00:02:32.640> get

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
probably looks a lot like 20 I'll get

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.970 
probably looks a lot like 20 I'll get
controls<00:02:33.330> or<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.870> other<00:02:33.989> directions<00:02:34.380> yep

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
controls or the other directions yep

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.070 
controls or the other directions yep
yeah<00:02:35.310> so<00:02:35.850> this<00:02:35.970> is<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.239> filament<00:02:36.720> this<00:02:36.810> is<00:02:36.930> the

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
yeah so this is the filament this is the

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.809 
yeah so this is the filament this is the
the<00:02:37.380> consumable<00:02:38.040> this<00:02:38.190> is<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.370> ink<00:02:38.550> for<00:02:38.790> the

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
the consumable this is the ink for the

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.120 
the consumable this is the ink for the
printer<00:02:38.880> essential<00:02:39.600> so<00:02:40.560> make<00:02:40.709> your<00:02:40.860> gear<00:02:41.010> was

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
printer essential so make your gear was

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.570 
printer essential so make your gear was
nice<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.459> throw<00:02:41.670> in<00:02:41.819> a<00:02:41.850> sample<00:02:42.709> spool<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:43.920> this

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
nice to throw in a sample spool and this

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.309 
nice to throw in a sample spool and this
is<00:02:44.700> translucent<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.510> comes<00:02:45.690> in<00:02:45.810> all<00:02:45.989> kinds<00:02:46.260> of

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
is translucent it comes in all kinds of

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.559 
is translucent it comes in all kinds of
different<00:02:46.380> colors<00:02:46.890> though<00:02:47.100> I<00:02:47.310> don't<00:02:48.269> know<00:02:48.420> as

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
different colors though I don't know as

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.449 
different colors though I don't know as
far<00:02:48.810> as<00:02:48.930> how<00:02:49.050> much<00:02:49.260> volume<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:49.980> spool<00:02:50.250> is

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
far as how much volume of the spool is

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.390 
far as how much volume of the spool is
but<00:02:50.840> one<00:02:51.840> thing<00:02:52.050> that<00:02:52.080> we<00:02:52.350> can<00:02:52.560> say<00:02:52.860> this

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
but one thing that we can say this

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.040 
but one thing that we can say this
particular<00:02:53.819> model<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.480> we're<00:02:54.660> assembling
