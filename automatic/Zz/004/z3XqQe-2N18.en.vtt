deployment<00:00:23.960> has<00:00:24.200> key<00:00:24.470> sections<00:00:24.980> such<00:00:25.490> as

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.520 
deployment has key sections such as

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.210 
deployment has key sections such as
triage<00:00:26.199> decontamination<00:00:27.199> screening<00:00:28.070> and

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.439 
triage decontamination screening and
treatment<00:00:30.550> so<00:00:31.550> for<00:00:31.730> transactions<00:00:32.300> is

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:32.449 
treatment so for transactions is

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:35.020 
treatment so for transactions is
actually<00:00:32.780> basically<00:00:32.989> the<00:00:33.940> privatization<00:00:34.940> of

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
actually basically the privatization of

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.660 
actually basically the privatization of
casualties<00:00:35.480> according<00:00:35.780> to<00:00:36.019> the<00:00:36.519> severity<00:00:37.519> of

injuries<00:00:39.850> for<00:00:40.850> the<00:00:40.940> concession<00:00:41.239> is<00:00:42.019> actually

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
injuries for the concession is actually

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:44.860 
injuries for the concession is actually
to<00:00:42.620> decontaminate<00:00:43.039> the<00:00:43.640> casualty<00:00:44.059> and<00:00:44.269> for

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
to decontaminate the casualty and for

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.569 
to decontaminate the casualty and for
screening<00:00:45.260> is<00:00:45.739> to<00:00:45.829> make<00:00:46.129> sure<00:00:46.159> that<00:00:46.429> the

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
screening is to make sure that the

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.489 
screening is to make sure that the
casualties<00:00:47.059> are<00:00:47.269> sufficiently<00:00:48.050> clean<00:00:48.289> so

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:48.499 
casualties are sufficiently clean so

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:49.860 
casualties are sufficiently clean so
that<00:00:48.649> can<00:00:48.769> send<00:00:48.979> them<00:00:49.100> back<00:00:49.249> to<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:49.519> treatment

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
that can send them back to the treatment

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.649 
that can send them back to the treatment
treatment<00:00:50.870> site<00:00:51.019> we<00:00:51.289> will<00:00:51.440> provide<00:00:51.889> a

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:52.659 
treatment site we will provide a

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:55.239 
treatment site we will provide a
supportive<00:00:53.659> care<00:00:53.870> before<00:00:54.769> they<00:00:54.920> are<00:00:54.949> the

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:55.249 
supportive care before they are the

00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:57.000 
supportive care before they are the
casualty<00:00:55.609> are<00:00:55.729> evacuated<00:00:56.329> for<00:00:56.629> definitive

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
casualty are evacuated for definitive

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.779 
casualty are evacuated for definitive
care<00:00:58.010> in<00:00:58.370> hospitals<00:01:00.579> setting<00:01:01.579> up<00:01:01.670> the

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
care in hospitals setting up the

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.410 
care in hospitals setting up the
deployment<00:01:02.329> is<00:01:02.449> hard<00:01:02.839> work<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:04.489> MRF<00:01:04.970> troopers

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
deployment is hard work the MRF troopers

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.779 
deployment is hard work the MRF troopers
put<00:01:05.899> up<00:01:06.020> heavy<00:01:06.289> pendants<00:01:06.829> as<00:01:06.979> shelters<00:01:07.549> and

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:07.789 
put up heavy pendants as shelters and

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:09.490 
put up heavy pendants as shelters and
bringing<00:01:08.420> all<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:08.810> stores<00:01:09.110> and<00:01:09.229> equipment

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
bringing all the stores and equipment

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.990 
bringing all the stores and equipment
separately<00:01:10.430> to<00:01:10.880> be<00:01:11.000> assembled<00:01:11.420> on<00:01:11.630> location

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
separately to be assembled on location

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.179 
separately to be assembled on location
this<00:01:14.000> is<00:01:14.149> a<00:01:14.180> life-saving<00:01:14.719> effort<00:01:15.229> so<00:01:15.829> the

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
this is a life-saving effort so the

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:17.260 
this is a life-saving effort so the
deployment<00:01:16.579> needs<00:01:16.729> to<00:01:16.789> be<00:01:16.850> fast<00:01:17.030> and<00:01:17.119> ready

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
deployment needs to be fast and ready

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.130 
deployment needs to be fast and ready
for<00:01:17.359> the<00:01:17.570> casualty

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
for the casualty

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.609 
for the casualty
so<00:01:18.560> that's<00:01:19.009> specially<00:01:19.640> where<00:01:19.789> energy<00:01:20.030> goes<00:01:20.329> to

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
so that's specially where energy goes to

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.130 
so that's specially where energy goes to
just<00:01:21.619> a<00:01:21.680> lot<00:01:21.770> of<00:01:22.060> running<00:01:23.060> around<00:01:23.119> getting<00:01:23.990> up

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
just a lot of running around getting up

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.980 
just a lot of running around getting up
stars<00:01:24.700> an<00:01:25.700> aura<00:01:25.909> of<00:01:26.060> spartax<00:01:26.479> pasilla<00:01:26.840> from

stars an aura of spartax pasilla from

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.919 
stars an aura of spartax pasilla from
the<00:01:27.079> crystal<00:01:27.439> it's<00:01:27.619> a<00:01:27.680> very<00:01:27.859> heavy<00:01:28.689> the<00:01:29.689> fact

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
the crystal it's a very heavy the fact

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:31.539 
the crystal it's a very heavy the fact
that<00:01:30.020> these<00:01:30.289> tasks<00:01:30.799> are<00:01:30.950> done<00:01:31.159> in<00:01:31.399> their

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
that these tasks are done in their

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
Mach 4 suit under the Sun means that it

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:37.899 
Mach 4 suit under the Sun means that it
becomes<00:01:36.530> even<00:01:37.070> more<00:01:37.100> physically<00:01:37.729> demanding

deployment namely the decontamination

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.940 
deployment namely the decontamination
and<00:02:13.060> treatment<00:02:13.630> sections<00:02:14.050> will<00:02:14.560> be<00:02:14.590> a<00:02:14.710> lot

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
and treatment sections will be a lot

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.880 
and treatment sections will be a lot
less<00:02:15.220> strenuous<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:16.000> a<00:02:16.270> lot<00:02:16.450> faster<00:02:16.890> shaving

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
less strenuous and a lot faster shaving

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.920 
less strenuous and a lot faster shaving
off<00:02:18.040> more<00:02:18.340> than<00:02:18.490> 1/3<00:02:18.940> of<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.180> time<00:02:19.330> needed<00:02:19.630> for

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
off more than 1/3 of the time needed for

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.589 
off more than 1/3 of the time needed for
the<00:02:20.260> setup

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.530 

so<00:02:23.200> how<00:02:23.379> does<00:02:23.439> a<00:02:23.709> new<00:02:23.980> mdtv<00:02:24.549> compared<00:02:25.299> to<00:02:25.420> the
