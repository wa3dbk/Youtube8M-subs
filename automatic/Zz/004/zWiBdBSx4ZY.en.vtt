move into the next step the next step is

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.560 
move into the next step the next step is
uh<00:00:49.409> trying<00:00:50.409> to<00:00:50.500> make<00:00:50.650> it<00:00:50.799> snowy<00:00:51.339> the<00:00:51.790> snowy<00:00:52.059> the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:01.299 
crucial you need this and now the next

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:05.039 
crucial you need this and now the next
step<00:01:01.449> is<00:01:02.070> bit<00:01:03.070> uh<00:01:03.280> dig<00:01:04.089> up<00:01:04.210> these<00:01:04.449> things<00:01:04.510> and

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
step is bit uh dig up these things and

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:06.600 
step is bit uh dig up these things and
then<00:01:05.260> it<00:01:05.439> will<00:01:05.530> have<00:01:05.560> staff<00:01:05.979> parts<00:01:06.310> in<00:01:06.460> them
