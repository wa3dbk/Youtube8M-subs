00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 
directors need to work a little bit

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:19.639

harder<00:06:17.399> also<00:06:18.240> ask<00:06:18.449> for<00:06:18.750> max<00:06:18.960> the<00:06:19.199> dog<00:06:19.349> himself

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:19.649 
harder also ask for max the dog himself

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:22.309 
harder also ask for max the dog himself
you<00:06:20.460> know<00:06:20.580> he<00:06:20.789> was<00:06:20.939> portrayed<00:06:21.330> really<00:06:22.110> well

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 
you know he was portrayed really well

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:24.110 
you know he was portrayed really well
and<00:06:22.649> I<00:06:22.889> think<00:06:23.129> one<00:06:23.460> of<00:06:23.490> the<00:06:23.639> things<00:06:23.849> I<00:06:23.969> like

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
and I think one of the things I like

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.909 
and I think one of the things I like
most<00:06:24.149> about<00:06:24.599> the<00:06:24.810> portrayal<00:06:25.110> of<00:06:25.349> Max<00:06:25.589> is<00:06:25.800> that

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 
most about the portrayal of Max is that

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:27.980 
most about the portrayal of Max is that
he<00:06:25.979> was<00:06:26.099> portrayed<00:06:26.550> as<00:06:26.580> a<00:06:26.729> dog<00:06:27.089> you<00:06:27.839> know<00:06:27.960> I

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
he was portrayed as a dog you know I

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.230 
he was portrayed as a dog you know I
didn't<00:06:28.199> have<00:06:28.349> some<00:06:28.589> special<00:06:29.370> super<00:06:29.819> quality

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
didn't have some special super quality

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.999 
didn't have some special super quality
that<00:06:30.449> made<00:06:30.629> him<00:06:30.779> like<00:06:30.960> more<00:06:31.199> human<00:06:31.620> than<00:06:31.740> dog

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:32.009 
that made him like more human than dog

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:35.629 
that made him like more human than dog
and<00:06:32.849> that<00:06:33.089> I<00:06:33.360> think<00:06:33.629> really<00:06:34.529> was<00:06:34.979> respectful

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639 
and that I think really was respectful

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:37.249 
and that I think really was respectful
of<00:06:35.729> what<00:06:35.909> these<00:06:36.120> dogs<00:06:36.360> who<00:06:36.750> serve<00:06:37.020> in<00:06:37.199> the

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:37.259 
of what these dogs who serve in the

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:39.769 
of what these dogs who serve in the
military<00:06:37.379> do<00:06:37.979> in<00:06:38.159> real<00:06:38.639> life<00:06:38.909> because<00:06:39.509> the

00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:39.779 
military do in real life because the

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:41.450 
military do in real life because the
things<00:06:40.020> that<00:06:40.199> max<00:06:40.439> does<00:06:40.740> in<00:06:40.949> this<00:06:41.069> film<00:06:41.279> are

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
things that max does in this film are

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.700 
things that max does in this film are
things<00:06:41.699> that<00:06:41.759> dogs<00:06:42.000> actually<00:06:42.300> can<00:06:42.930> do<00:06:43.139> and<00:06:43.409> do

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 
things that dogs actually can do and do

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.790 
things that dogs actually can do and do
do<00:06:44.009> so<00:06:44.849> the<00:06:45.000> film<00:06:45.240> not<00:06:45.599> only<00:06:45.810> educates<00:06:46.349> you<00:06:46.589> I

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 
do so the film not only educates you I

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.860 
do so the film not only educates you I
think<00:06:46.889> about<00:06:47.219> the<00:06:47.759> current<00:06:47.969> situation<00:06:48.149> for

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:48.870 
think about the current situation for

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.529 
think about the current situation for
soldiers<00:06:49.080> and<00:06:49.349> their<00:06:49.500> families<00:06:49.529> but<00:06:50.519> also<00:06:50.580> you

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:51.539 
soldiers and their families but also you

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:52.610 
soldiers and their families but also you
really<00:06:51.870> do<00:06:52.080> feel<00:06:52.319> like<00:06:52.379> you

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 
really do feel like you

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.590 
really do feel like you
a<00:06:52.650> better<00:06:52.949> understanding<00:06:53.699> for<00:06:53.729> dogs<00:06:54.090> and<00:06:54.360> war

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:54.600 
a better understanding for dogs and war

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.840 
a better understanding for dogs and war
how<00:06:55.350> they<00:06:55.530> train<00:06:55.830> and<00:06:56.100> the<00:06:56.280> purpose<00:06:56.669> they

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:56.850 
how they train and the purpose they

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.390 
how they train and the purpose they
serve<00:06:57.060> and<00:06:57.360> the<00:06:57.510> people<00:06:57.840> that<00:06:57.990> they<00:06:58.110> affect<00:06:58.530> so
