00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
was a little bit of a challenge I

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.340 
was a little bit of a challenge I
thought<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.750> would<00:00:36.870> be<00:00:36.960> more<00:00:37.140> interesting

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
thought it would be more interesting

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
thought it would be more interesting
because<00:00:38.780> she<00:00:39.780> has<00:00:39.930> two<00:00:40.200> forms<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:41.129> right<00:00:41.340> there

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
because she has two forms so right there

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.430 
because she has two forms so right there
it's<00:00:41.730> like<00:00:41.940> I'm<00:00:42.090> designing<00:00:42.450> two<00:00:42.930> characters

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
it's like I'm designing two characters

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.130 
it's like I'm designing two characters
right<00:00:43.620> off<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.950> bat<00:00:44.210> are<00:00:45.210> two<00:00:45.450> new<00:00:45.570> skins<00:00:45.870> for

them natalie is one of my favorite

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.200 
them natalie is one of my favorite
characters<00:00:51.660> just<00:00:51.780> because<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.440> her<00:00:52.559> utility

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
characters just because of her utility

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.549 
characters just because of her utility
linking<00:00:54.210> she<00:00:54.449> doesn't<00:00:54.780> always<00:00:55.050> have<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.469> best

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559

linking she doesn't always have the best
foot<00:00:56.129> up<00:00:56.399> but<00:00:56.850> she's<00:00:57.090> still<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:58.020> much<00:00:58.199> fun<00:00:58.410> to

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
foot up but she's still so much fun to

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.200 
foot up but she's still so much fun to
play<00:00:58.590> especially<00:00:59.010> towards<00:00:59.730> middle<00:00:59.969> game

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
play especially towards middle game

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.130

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
glowy bits which might not be visible

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.380 
glowy bits which might not be visible
right<00:02:18.410> now<00:02:20.890> this<00:02:21.890> one<00:02:22.130> time<00:02:22.610> wise<00:02:22.940> i<00:02:23.150> think<00:02:23.330> it

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
right now this one time wise i think it

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.920 
right now this one time wise i think it
took<00:02:23.480> me<00:02:23.660> about<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:23.870> same<00:02:23.990> time<00:02:24.200> as<00:02:24.440> malc<00:02:25.040> i

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
took me about the same time as malc i

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.480 
took me about the same time as malc i
did<00:02:26.930> because<00:02:27.110> they're<00:02:27.440> recording<00:02:27.950> for<00:02:28.160> just

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
did because they're recording for just

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.040 
did because they're recording for just
about<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.970> same<00:02:29.180> length<00:02:29.480> i<00:02:29.570> guess<00:02:29.720> in<00:02:29.810> Italy

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
about the same length i guess in Italy

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.740 
about the same length i guess in Italy
is<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:30.200> little<00:02:30.500> bit<00:02:30.590> longer<00:02:30.860> but<00:02:31.480> seeing<00:02:32.480> as<00:02:32.600> how

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
is a little bit longer but seeing as how

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.479 
is a little bit longer but seeing as how
there<00:02:32.959> is<00:02:33.080> actually<00:02:33.470> two<00:02:33.500> characters<00:02:34.220> that's

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
there is actually two characters that's

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.970 
there is actually two characters that's
acceptable<00:02:35.450> I<00:02:35.780> think<00:02:38.080> I'm<00:02:39.080> almost<00:02:39.380> to<00:02:39.860> the

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
acceptable I think I'm almost to the

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.740 
acceptable I think I'm almost to the
point<00:02:40.160> where<00:02:40.370> I<00:02:40.400> start<00:02:40.790> adding<00:02:40.940> color<00:02:41.480> I'm

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
point where I start adding color I'm

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.140 
point where I start adding color I'm
just<00:02:41.930> going<00:02:42.230> back<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.680> finishing<00:02:43.190> some<00:02:44.000> of

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
just going back and finishing some of

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.940 
just going back and finishing some of
the<00:02:44.300> finer<00:02:44.540> details<00:02:44.660> or<00:02:45.320> finding<00:02:45.709> everything

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
the finer details or finding everything

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.540 
the finer details or finding everything
a<00:02:46.190> little<00:02:46.310> bit<00:02:46.580> oh<00:02:46.850> yeah<00:02:47.810> her<00:02:48.080> her<00:02:48.800> trident<00:02:49.370> I

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
a little bit oh yeah her her trident I

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.790 
a little bit oh yeah her her trident I
think<00:02:49.790> would<00:02:49.910> be<00:02:50.030> awesome<00:02:50.390> going<00:02:51.290> back<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.500> the

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
think would be awesome going back to the

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.250 
think would be awesome going back to the
side<00:02:52.250> in<00:02:52.430> a<00:02:52.519> little<00:02:52.790> bit<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.630> know<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:54.050> nymph

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
side in a little bit you know the nymph

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.160 
side in a little bit you know the nymph
of<00:02:54.380> this<00:02:55.180> now<00:02:56.180> that<00:02:56.360> that's<00:02:56.510> what<00:02:56.630> Poseidon<00:02:57.080> is

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
of this now that that's what Poseidon is

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.420 
of this now that that's what Poseidon is
but<00:02:57.500> anyhow<00:02:59.140> the<00:03:00.140> coloring<00:03:00.680> for<00:03:00.890> this<00:03:01.040> image

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
but anyhow the coloring for this image

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.410 
but anyhow the coloring for this image
was<00:03:01.880> a<00:03:02.560> bit<00:03:03.560> more<00:03:03.769> intense<00:03:04.220> than<00:03:04.820> it<00:03:04.970> was<00:03:05.150> for

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
was a bit more intense than it was for

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.570 
was a bit more intense than it was for
maokai<00:03:05.780> or<00:03:06.019> sumo<00:03:06.380> Gragas<00:03:06.830> simply<00:03:07.190> because<00:03:07.550> of

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
maokai or sumo Gragas simply because of

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.770 
maokai or sumo Gragas simply because of
a<00:03:08.180> new<00:03:08.870> style<00:03:09.200> I<00:03:09.470> was<00:03:09.650> trying<00:03:09.890> I<00:03:10.430> actually<00:03:11.180> used

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
a new style I was trying I actually used

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.750 
a new style I was trying I actually used
a<00:03:12.080> couple<00:03:12.530> of<00:03:12.650> layers<00:03:12.890> with<00:03:13.400> different

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
a couple of layers with different

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.580 
a couple of layers with different
settings<00:03:13.970> on<00:03:14.360> them<00:03:14.570> so<00:03:14.870> I<00:03:14.900> had<00:03:15.110> to<00:03:15.140> go<00:03:15.380> through

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
settings on them so I had to go through

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.110 
settings on them so I had to go through
each<00:03:15.739> layer<00:03:16.010> individually<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:16.850> put<00:03:17.030> the

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
each layer individually and put the

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.610 
each layer individually and put the
color<00:03:17.330> down<00:03:17.570> so<00:03:17.870> that's<00:03:17.959> what<00:03:18.170> you<00:03:18.260> see<00:03:18.440> me

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
color down so that's what you see me

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.220 
color down so that's what you see me
doing

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
doing

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
doing
I<00:03:20.870> definitely<00:03:21.870> like<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.200> effect<00:03:22.709> that<00:03:22.830> I<00:03:23.040> got

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
I definitely like the effect that I got

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.089 
I definitely like the effect that I got
those<00:03:23.489> it's<00:03:24.390> very<00:03:24.599> nice<00:03:24.840> kind<00:03:25.260> of<00:03:25.349> flows<00:03:25.650> from

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
those it's very nice kind of flows from

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:31.910 
those it's very nice kind of flows from
the<00:03:26.159> inside<00:03:26.580> a<00:03:26.610> little<00:03:26.970> bit<00:03:27.090> I<00:03:30.650> think<00:03:31.650> it<00:03:31.769> would

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
the inside a little bit I think it would

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.920 
the inside a little bit I think it would
be<00:03:32.099> really<00:03:32.280> cool<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:32.700> see<00:03:32.879> skin<00:03:33.360> like<00:03:33.540> this<00:03:33.750> in

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
be really cool to see skin like this in

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.080 
be really cool to see skin like this in
game<00:03:34.170> you<00:03:34.860> have<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.099> deep-sea<00:03:35.519> mid-late<00:03:35.879> all

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
game you have the deep-sea mid-late all

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.839 
game you have the deep-sea mid-late all
you<00:03:36.209> can<00:03:36.299> even<00:03:36.360> have<00:03:36.599> like<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.750> deep<00:03:37.019> scene<00:03:37.290> to

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
you can even have like a deep scene to

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.789 
you can even have like a deep scene to
scene<00:03:38.849> with<00:03:39.000> Gragas<00:03:39.420> and<00:03:39.870> she<00:03:40.590> oh<00:03:40.620> yeah<00:03:40.769> I

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
scene with Gragas and she oh yeah I

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.170 
scene with Gragas and she oh yeah I
think<00:03:40.890> agua<00:03:41.610> I<00:03:41.940> kassadin<00:03:44.000> that<00:03:45.000> might

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
think agua I kassadin that might

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.110 
think agua I kassadin that might
actually<00:03:45.299> work<00:03:45.629> too<00:03:45.989> much<00:03:46.140> too<00:03:46.440> cuz<00:03:47.000> cuz<00:03:48.000> it's

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
actually work too much too cuz cuz it's

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.059 
actually work too much too cuz cuz it's
all<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.329> elements<00:03:48.569> there<00:03:48.959> maybe<00:03:49.799> you<00:03:49.890> have

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
all the elements there maybe you have

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.350 
all the elements there maybe you have
like<00:03:50.220> an<00:03:50.340> attack<00:03:50.579> damage<00:03:50.730> in<00:03:51.000> Italy<00:03:51.239> but

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
like an attack damage in Italy but

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.900 
like an attack damage in Italy but
that's<00:03:51.569> no<00:03:51.810> fun<00:03:54.230> at<00:03:55.230> torch<00:03:55.680> this<00:03:56.280> part<00:03:56.640> of<00:03:56.760> the

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
that's no fun at torch this part of the

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.170 
that's no fun at torch this part of the
image<00:03:57.120> I<00:03:57.629> could<00:03:58.140> quite<00:03:58.799> find<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.489> colors<00:03:59.910> i

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
image I could quite find the colors i

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.650 
image I could quite find the colors i
was<00:04:00.390> looking<00:04:01.019> for<00:04:01.500> there's<00:04:01.769> just<00:04:02.390> too<00:04:03.390> much

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
was looking for there's just too much

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.559

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
blue for me so i was messing with this

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.449 
blue for me so i was messing with this
guy<00:04:09.870> trying<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:10.680> figure<00:04:10.950> out<00:04:11.010> a<00:04:11.099> balance

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
guy trying to figure out a balance

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.550 
guy trying to figure out a balance
between<00:04:11.579> the<00:04:11.819> water<00:04:13.879> when<00:04:15.199> eventually<00:04:16.199> i'll

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
between the water when eventually i'll

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.289 
between the water when eventually i'll
just<00:04:16.829> like<00:04:16.949> you<00:04:17.070> know<00:04:17.160> what<00:04:17.340> this<00:04:17.729> needs<00:04:18.090> to

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
just like you know what this needs to

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.960 
just like you know what this needs to
change<00:04:18.630> and<00:04:19.410> so<00:04:19.919> i<00:04:19.949> made<00:04:20.190> a<00:04:20.220> nice<00:04:20.579> sort<00:04:20.880> of

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
change and so i made a nice sort of

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.850 
change and so i made a nice sort of
sunset<00:04:21.510> esky<00:04:21.840> colors<00:04:22.289> that<00:04:22.440> you<00:04:22.500> would<00:04:22.740> never

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
sunset esky colors that you would never

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.700
