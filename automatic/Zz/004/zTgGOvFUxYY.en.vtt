00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.810
 the pm Schoenfeld he capped his team very much to me 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.580
 This is organized by Reiter Revue International and the 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.019
 personal members of the FPL 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.220
 just so that this year's big final in Hagen at the tournament Horses and 

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:22.199
 Dreams of 250 teams have 8 teams for this final 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.539
 qualified 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.099
 Starter and Seger presented by Sarah Schnieder and Kerstin Wachter 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.650
 Nahla Thier can be endgame 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.140
 that means that only they jump little and for many the first big one 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.430
 Star at an international competition always awaited the country arrived 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.690
 Carinthia a long way 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.580
 yes, that's 120 kilometers, but we've become champions 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.050
 and by the year we qualified Sarah Freutel would be one at one almost 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.420
 All sold we have four girls net around this endrich the qualification 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.540
 the already so that in the ProB what to expect but they are never on it 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.230
 and also the other teams and the organizers are excited about the start 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.300
 contrary to what is actually an idea behind the school holidays again 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.610
 So a whole team is behind it 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.219
 four riders must show themselves well Aigner 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:18.450
 but is pranks but all four must perform well 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.320
 So the team rush thank you is in the foreground 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.159
 as a second son this is a very important aspect for us 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.900
 actually times the public show that we in Germany in many 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.140
 certainly not everywhere but in many places very well suffered 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.950
 have very well brought out very well-kept school horses and that 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.140
 should actually be high on the blame for the further trip one because 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.150
 Thirdly 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.010
 Visitors have the fact that we are happy if the riders have them too 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.010
 School horse start riding. Super 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.610
 Bernese Oberlander in addition to the riding of a team, it is as far as it is 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.610
 also a small park clock demanded 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.170
 not so easy 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.029
 the team outfit and the right character 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:11.629
 Valuable points in the judges also bring to the dispute 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:18.409
 4 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.409
 the 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.049
 Why 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.519
 hor 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.200
 good trainers ensure good fundamentals in the saddle 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.729
 because that's what the judges want to see 

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:53.430
 Dr the states made sure the riders are balanced 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.500
 that they let go well in the saddle and that they are quite fine on their track 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.049
 interact and that especially 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.829
 succeeded in leading teams and who found it particularly good that 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.629
 they actually always three or even all four riders from the end with 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.339
 had totally on the right track 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:15.229
 the judges liked the team of riding school old woman best 

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:18.109
 he grabs from Westphalian NATO 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.789
 the winners in abysses for their partner 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.749
 Yes 

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:28.709
 Judge Christoph Hefter has thanked 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.799
 that is the finest for the rider painters 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.620
 that goes far beyond the level of a normal school horse Reitz in the room 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:38.980
 good sitting good are good horse and horse 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.949
 Rider I think it's better for the team then applies 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:46.819
 To the winner Inter life how can the preparation now of its last time 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.209
 Here I have mine, you have to spend a while on it 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.229
 prepare for his band 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:54.899
 they did not prepare us for our training 

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:55.889
 actually finds 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:56.780
 weekly in the 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.460
 in the departments of the city that pass a department for forwarding too 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:01.589
 Head of department 

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:02.839
 that's life now 

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:04.599
 twice we multiplied 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.269
 because Schult FÃ¶rde Parkour trained once again have trained individual 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:09.689
 Elements of it 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:13.179
 yes so that we have done everything right here then 

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:16.549
 to bet this allegiance to you or t-shirts 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.669
 yes, because the father Joe Jackson is boring unfortunately 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.099
 To testify, it all said something special and at the same time 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:26.580
 the bosses of old rocker Dylan and his reports the user he quite well his 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.639
 Girl team fit 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.949
 but it should be properly trained because in the steel 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.599
 that is we say all ten their clubs also our own horses de 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:36.110
 Vere 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.479
 Practically to nourish yourself riding the morning to be worked 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.509
 the afternoon instead of one for machines sometimes with m school lessons 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:47.870
 with three excellent that she basically got exercise with frequent hand changes 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.710
 and sometimes you can go straight ahead without being always open 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:52.430
 circle 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.819
 Of course, that makes it a lot of fun, too 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:59.689
 To teach lessons one is as a riding instructor one can always come back 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:00.509
 motivate 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:05.210
 you can query all the lesson and your age will benefit from these well 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.569
 balanced TV 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:13.210
