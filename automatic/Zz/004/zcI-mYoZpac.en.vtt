00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
the right side right like right now but

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.240 
the right side right like right now but
what<00:01:21.689> we<00:01:21.840> can<00:01:22.080> see<00:01:22.290> also<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.040> know<00:01:23.130> it

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
what we can see also is that you know it

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.149

has this magic mouse a magic mouse
designs<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:27.240> mean<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.630> would<00:01:27.780> be<00:01:27.900> cool<00:01:28.110> if<00:01:28.140> you

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
designs I mean it would be cool if you

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.429 
designs I mean it would be cool if you
also<00:01:28.619> get<00:01:28.710> used<00:01:28.950> as<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> mouse<00:01:29.840> but<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.990> we<00:01:31.170> may

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
also get used as a mouse but that we may

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.200 
also get used as a mouse but that we may
be<00:01:31.500> kind<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.770> awkward<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.280> use<00:01:32.340> your<00:01:32.640> phone<00:01:32.729> as

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
be kind of awkward to use your phone as

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.050 
be kind of awkward to use your phone as
a<00:01:33.450> mouse<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:34.470> know<00:01:34.590> when<00:01:34.799> someone<00:01:35.130> calls<00:01:35.340> but

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060

a mouse you know when someone calls but
you<00:01:36.329> can<00:01:36.450> also<00:01:36.570> see<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.780> here<00:01:37.170> he<00:01:37.500> has<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
you can also see that here he has the

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.660 
you can also see that here he has the
speaker<00:01:38.369> on<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.240> right<00:01:39.420> side<00:01:39.950> no<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:40.979> mean<00:01:41.369> that

speaker on the right side no I mean that

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.330 
speaker on the right side no I mean that
the<00:01:41.850> audio<00:01:42.240> input<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.290> yeah<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.680> can<00:01:43.979> listen

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
to stuff and then we have another

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.670 
to stuff and then we have another
picture<00:01:47.670> here<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.899> would<00:01:49.110> only<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.560> know

picture here and I would only you know

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.740 
picture here and I would only you know
use<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.070> assume<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:50.820> one<00:01:51.090> would<00:01:51.299> come

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
use to assume that this one would come

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.429 
use to assume that this one would come
equipped<00:01:52.110> with<00:01:52.229> latest<00:01:52.939> apple<00:01:53.939> a6<00:01:54.149> or<00:01:54.720> if<00:01:54.899> the

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
equipped with latest apple a6 or if the

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.410 
equipped with latest apple a6 or if the
ipad<00:01:55.680> 3<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.040> going<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.219> have<00:01:56.369> this<00:01:56.490> a5x

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
ipad 3 is going to have this a5x

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.709 
ipad 3 is going to have this a5x
processor<00:01:57.710> then<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:59.460> know<00:01:59.579> like<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.820> clock

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
processor then you know like I clock

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.179 
processor then you know like I clock
Duke<00:02:00.930> or<00:02:01.200> something<00:02:01.530> like<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.649> then<00:02:02.009> we're

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
Duke or something like that then we're

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.670 
Duke or something like that then we're
all<00:02:02.369> gonna<00:02:02.520> see<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.820> same<00:02:03.030> thing<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:03.680> apple's

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
all gonna see the same thing on apple's

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.740 
all gonna see the same thing on apple's
iphone<00:02:05.070> 5<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.340> that's<00:02:05.880> kinda<00:02:06.180> disappointing

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
iphone 5 and that's kinda disappointing

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.650 
iphone 5 and that's kinda disappointing
in<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.020> quad-core<00:02:07.290> it's<00:02:07.890> it's<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.759> thing<00:02:09.179> this

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
in a quad-core it's it's the thing this

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.170 
in a quad-core it's it's the thing this
year<00:02:09.720> we<00:02:10.709> see<00:02:10.890> anything<00:02:11.250> tablets<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.060> stuff

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
year we see anything tablets and stuff

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.100 
year we see anything tablets and stuff
like<00:02:12.270> that<00:02:12.330> so

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
like that so

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.870 
like that so
yeah<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.710> is<00:02:14.040> going<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.460> be<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.580> little

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
yeah that is going to be a little

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.640 
yeah that is going to be a little
disappointing<00:02:15.270> so<00:02:15.420> hopefully<00:02:15.840> was<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.170> a6

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
disappointing so hopefully was the a6

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.940 
disappointing so hopefully was the a6
here<00:02:16.920> with<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.970> improved<00:02:18.720> camera<00:02:19.050> will<00:02:19.800> be

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
here with the improved camera will be

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.920 
here with the improved camera will be
cooked<00:02:20.130> in<00:02:20.280> 12<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.790> piece<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:20.970> camera<00:02:21.420> but<00:02:21.660> if

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
cooked in 12 a piece of camera but if

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.870 
cooked in 12 a piece of camera but if
you<00:02:22.170> think<00:02:22.230> about<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.740> thickness<00:02:23.010> here<00:02:23.460> as<00:02:23.700> we

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
you think about the thickness here as we

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.060 
you think about the thickness here as we
can<00:02:24.060> see<00:02:24.210> here<00:02:24.240> on<00:02:24.510> these<00:02:24.660> color<00:02:24.900> pictures<00:02:25.410> the

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
can see here on these color pictures the

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.670 
can see here on these color pictures the
thickness<00:02:26.520> it's<00:02:26.700> very<00:02:27.030> thin<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.570> a<00:02:28.110> 12<00:02:28.410> piece

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
thickness it's very thin and a 12 piece

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.940 
thickness it's very thin and a 12 piece
of<00:02:28.830> camera<00:02:29.360> if<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.780> want<00:02:30.960> a<00:02:31.050> good<00:02:31.290> 12

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
of camera if you want a good 12

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.770 
of camera if you want a good 12
megapixel<00:02:32.310> camera<00:02:32.610> with<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:32.760> good<00:02:32.970> sensor<00:02:33.450> then

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
megapixel camera with a good sensor then

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.660 
megapixel camera with a good sensor then
this<00:02:34.170> program<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.770> take<00:02:34.920> up<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:35.190> lot<00:02:35.340> of<00:02:35.400> space

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
this program to take up a lot of space

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.170 
this program to take up a lot of space
and<00:02:35.910> also<00:02:36.980> I'm<00:02:37.980> pretty<00:02:38.220> sure<00:02:38.490> if<00:02:38.610> this<00:02:38.790> is<00:02:38.850> some

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
and also I'm pretty sure if this is some

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.000 
and also I'm pretty sure if this is some
will<00:02:39.420> be<00:02:39.630> as<00:02:39.870> good<00:02:40.200> because<00:02:40.440> we<00:02:40.740> probably

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
will be as good because we probably

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.400 
will be as good because we probably
would<00:02:41.250> have<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.430> very<00:02:41.730> poor<00:02:42.090> battery<00:02:42.810> is

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
would have a very poor battery is

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.949 
would have a very poor battery is
because<00:02:43.830> it's<00:02:44.010> very<00:02:44.310> thin<00:02:44.760> on<00:02:45.060> both<00:02:45.240> sides<00:02:45.540> and

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
because it's very thin on both sides and

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.840 
because it's very thin on both sides and
then<00:02:46.110> it's<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.380> little<00:02:46.590> bigger<00:02:46.770> in<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.430> middle

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
then it's a little bigger in the middle

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.300 
then it's a little bigger in the middle
but<00:02:48.570> still<00:02:49.020> it's<00:02:49.440> it's<00:02:49.890> an<00:02:50.040> interesting

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
but still it's it's an interesting

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.220 
but still it's it's an interesting
concept<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:51.180> here<00:02:51.330> you<00:02:51.480> know<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.780> darkness

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
concept and here you know the darkness

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.710 
concept and here you know the darkness
that<00:02:52.380> that<00:02:52.440> thing<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:53.580> Apple<00:02:54.030> logo<00:02:54.330> would

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
that that thing that Apple logo would

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.210 
that that thing that Apple logo would
glow<00:02:55.140> up<00:02:55.550> yeah<00:02:56.550> that<00:02:57.450> would<00:02:57.630> be<00:02:57.660> cool<00:02:58.050> yeah<00:02:58.800> and

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
glow up yeah that would be cool yeah and

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.340 
glow up yeah that would be cool yeah and
here<00:02:59.970> we<00:03:00.000> can<00:03:00.180> see<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.390> final<00:03:00.870> picture<00:03:01.050> which

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
here we can see the final picture which

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.020 
here we can see the final picture which
actually<00:03:01.709> it's<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.190> picture<00:03:02.640> that<00:03:02.760> I<00:03:02.940> do

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
actually it's the picture that I do

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.810 
actually it's the picture that I do
enjoy<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.780> most<00:03:04.050> and<00:03:04.500> I<00:03:05.160> think<00:03:05.400> this<00:03:05.550> is<00:03:05.610> a

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
enjoy the most and I think this is a

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.810 
enjoy the most and I think this is a
pretty<00:03:06.420> amazing<00:03:06.959> design<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:08.100> i'm<00:03:08.640> pretty

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
pretty amazing design and i'm pretty

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.420 
pretty amazing design and i'm pretty
sure<00:03:09.000> if<00:03:09.120> i<00:03:09.180> like<00:03:09.209> it<00:03:09.420> because<00:03:10.320> okay<00:03:11.070> first<00:03:11.310> of

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
sure if i like it because okay first of

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.550 
sure if i like it because okay first of
all<00:03:11.459> i<00:03:11.520> think<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.150> sign<00:03:12.480> like<00:03:12.900> right<00:03:13.410> now

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
all i think to the sign like right now

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.800 
all i think to the sign like right now
on<00:03:13.950> life<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.340> for<00:03:14.489> us<00:03:14.610> and<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.150> same<00:03:15.450> with

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
on life and for us and the same with

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.160 
on life and for us and the same with
dolphin<00:03:16.170> for<00:03:16.410> its<00:03:16.680> kind<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.489> clean<00:03:17.730> but<00:03:18.170> the

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
dolphin for its kind of clean but the

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.199 
dolphin for its kind of clean but the
edges<00:03:19.620> is<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:19.980> little<00:03:20.370> too<00:03:20.489> hard<00:03:20.760> i<00:03:20.910> think<00:03:21.090> this

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
edges is a little too hard i think this

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.120 
edges is a little too hard i think this
want<00:03:21.480> this<00:03:21.780> as<00:03:22.230> we<00:03:22.380> can<00:03:22.500> see<00:03:22.650> here<00:03:22.680> on<00:03:23.070> the

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
want this as we can see here on the

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.449 
want this as we can see here on the
picture<00:03:23.910> would<00:03:24.450> be<00:03:24.480> nicer<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:25.049> hold<00:03:25.440> but<00:03:25.799> still

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
picture would be nicer to hold but still

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.490 
picture would be nicer to hold but still
think<00:03:26.700> it<00:03:26.850> would<00:03:27.060> be<00:03:27.180> a<00:03:27.209> little<00:03:27.540> too<00:03:27.780> fat<00:03:28.110> and

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
think it would be a little too fat and

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.820 
think it would be a little too fat and
there<00:03:28.830> in<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.040> middle<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:30.470> yeah<00:03:31.470> but<00:03:31.650> it

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
there in the middle and yeah but it

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.110 
there in the middle and yeah but it
would<00:03:31.980> be<00:03:32.010> definitely<00:03:32.250> interesting<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:32.940> see

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
would be definitely interesting to see

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.850 
would be definitely interesting to see
Apple<00:03:33.660> you<00:03:34.080> know<00:03:34.200> create<00:03:34.500> something<00:03:34.739> like

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
Apple you know create something like

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.160 
Apple you know create something like
this<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.670> know<00:03:35.760> create<00:03:36.060> another<00:03:36.420> variant<00:03:36.959> of

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
this you know create another variant of

would love very very hard and they also
i<00:04:00.030> mean<00:04:00.180> if<00:04:00.390> you<00:04:00.480> if<00:04:00.870> you<00:04:01.170> would<00:04:01.290> try<00:04:01.530> to<00:04:01.560> use

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
i mean if you if you would try to use

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.729 
i mean if you if you would try to use
this<00:04:01.980> in<00:04:02.160> a<00:04:02.250> landscape<00:04:02.610> mode<00:04:02.940> it's<00:04:03.660> it's<00:04:04.170> kind

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
this in a landscape mode it's it's kind

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:05.960 
this in a landscape mode it's it's kind
of<00:04:04.769> hard<00:04:05.010> and<00:04:05.190> when<00:04:05.310> you<00:04:05.400> put<00:04:05.580> it<00:04:05.670> on<00:04:05.790> your<00:04:05.910> desk

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
that would be kind of awkward because

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.280 
that would be kind of awkward because
you<00:04:07.769> have<00:04:07.920> to<00:04:08.130> have<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:08.880> screen<00:04:09.299> face<00:04:09.900> down

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
you have to have the screen face down

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.620 
you have to have the screen face down
but<00:04:10.920> i<00:04:10.950> mean<00:04:11.070> if<00:04:11.250> you<00:04:11.340> think<00:04:11.370> about<00:04:11.640> if<00:04:12.000> if<00:04:12.299> if

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
but i mean if you think about if if if

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.199 
but i mean if you think about if if if
Apple<00:04:13.230> implement<00:04:14.040> this<00:04:14.160> new<00:04:14.220> like<00:04:14.579> real<00:04:14.820> glass

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
that's going to be even better but gets

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.490 
that's going to be even better but gets
right<00:04:18.000> now<00:04:18.180> I<00:04:18.209> mean<00:04:18.419> the<00:04:18.540> screen<00:04:18.840> life<00:04:19.140> and<00:04:19.320> for

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
right now I mean the screen life and for

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.300
