00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.740
 do not incorporate it with cream and also 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.260
 dissolve the cajeta with the 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.580

 use instead of vanilla cajeta 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.900
 the cajeta in my nothing that has a slight 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:27.390
 liqueur touch cited that is very rich is 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.569
