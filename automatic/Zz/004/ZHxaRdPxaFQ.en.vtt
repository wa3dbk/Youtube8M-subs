00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.359
 I notice or did not notice 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:09.080
 okay, we're doing something risky now 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.080
 which is very risky 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.750
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:20.980
 new round minecraft two more games 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.919
 and here comes because, as already 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.410
 now very quickly in the middle where 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:28.089
 the boxes are or not me 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.259
 this crate could no unfortunately 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:30.910
 somehow I open more 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.050
 a few sound bucks with minecraft and 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.610
 I already believe that this 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.030
 heated bad will certainly try 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.710
 our best and and and he will catch up and 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.120
 that's up there my powers that's it 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.039
 no crate and now swims like that 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.230
 waterfall high dream already swimming 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:45.760
 swimming swim swimming human 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.469
 you have to really make an effort and there 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.120
 is already the protection time to an end because 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.020
 downstairs, one could actually give me one 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.570
 get hold of the box 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.760
 with a cake but that helps us now 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.170
 not further and there we are 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.910
 even a surface of one means that 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.289
 just run fast 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.449
 but that is probably not the case 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.710
 Crate and somehow I do not see any 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.420
 other player daughter is a box 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.530
 I hope they all had one too 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.310
 we already have a bit of college there 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.950
 a weapon okay is okay 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.090
 one with life for now i would have now 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.830
 but a little bit better 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.690
 eg diamond axes we have already 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.160
 made quite good experiences but what 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.240
 heck that's a pretty small 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.240
 even just web 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.219
 we'll catch that gesture, too 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.149
 ok sticks and word do not send so well 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:34.590
 not so nice there is better and me 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.740
 I think that will be pretty short too 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.840
 Round is not so bad me 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.369
 I just wanted to tell you I have too 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.770
 already some people for the battle 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.350
 Minecraft found and like it 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.319
 It will definitely look like this 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.969
 So there are really people here 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:51.840
 I did something with them 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:57.420
 but now nothing bad 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.819
 mean because many so first so you 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.840
 will they know so some of whom he 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:08.640
 who sure know so here we have to 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.720
 high then there's also soon 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.970
 finally a battle season on one 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.989
 channel and therefore is actually 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.310
 not so bad that this round 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.680
 I will not be so long now 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.209
 probably who knows maybe there 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.370
 in the end, it's still such a good one 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.510
 surprise but I think I propose 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.360
 I'm fine now I still have 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.180
 no opponent had seen my pair 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.840
 things are twice as calm now 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.639
 Okay, so ok, you have to get the 20 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.489
 open okay we definitely have 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:37.139
 this compass that I have nothing now 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:43.530
 So not that any player in the 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:45.269
 Close would be why it has something for as well 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.220
 particle is it from this material or 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.880
 so that's probably from this one 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.040
 material 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.660
 but I see there but right down there 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.639
 a player i can not approach though 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.260
 zoom I unfortunately have no optimal 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:58.560
 think about what is better wood or 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.019
 This axis I believe if I buck 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.400
 hitting do i believe steinachs or 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.889
 wooden sword makes no difference 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.450
 whether both are equally good but there I am 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:08.190
 honestly not so sure 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.410
 but I think so it would have to 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:15.329
 actually both are equally good there 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:17.660
 Below is a team of super bowl shit 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:20.130
 I alone against the team 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.750
 that can be something but the thieves 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.380
 I did not think so 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.380
 He noticed me 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.670
 damn no he has me i believe 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:33.010
 Not noticed noticed me or noticed 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:39.260
 I'm not okay, we do something 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:42.620
 risky what very risky ghotel 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.300
 script ok yes we have caught 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.830
 okay okay if I wash the team now 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.780
 Honestly, if I am this team now 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.830
 okay, okay 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.410
 gsc the hochjagd nice people nice we 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:58.130
 have pushed the team up with tactics 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.350
 the court our guests would come tactics me 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.850
 think if I okay the iron city on 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.489
 definitely here to take take the school 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.010
 us also the iron-hammer age 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.150
 okay here is nobody is anywhere 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.599
 someone because of that someone is no here 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.910
 none 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:12.560
 ok so that even another iron pros 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.049
 armor okay people having really me 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.769
 new team really new team 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.540
 wiped out 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.280
 So if that's not a skill now 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.959
 Now everyone can say what he wants 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.760
 I'll stay right now 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.830
 selfish and says I have it 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.550
 So people that was really that now 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.680
 was nevertheless real hammer with the tnt 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.650
 i can see i get i get it 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.210
 Here again it is ok goes straight off 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.410
 was there anything good that is 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.680
 In any case, I still wanted arrows 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.860
 have to go eat cake now shit 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.750
 quickly eat something fast 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.510
 okay okay he was behind me 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.400
 why was he behind me why were you 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.260
 behind me why I had 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.400
 But I think it is actually quite 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.950
 happy you have that team 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.190
 deathmatch the people just behind 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:00.500
 a spawn that sucks I 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.810
 but already can not say 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.160
 opposite a spot but still 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.710
 nothing is so good I do not begrudge your 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.729
 victory yes you were you lure me from 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.889
 attacked behind that is evil and yes 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.930
 as I said it is genuine that I like that 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:17.240
 Not so much as I do that quite well 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:21.289
 but I think that's really shit 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.850
 and I hope you have this round too 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.940
 We liked it the next time 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.940
 again
