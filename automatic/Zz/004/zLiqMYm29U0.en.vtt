00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.010
 have you ever come across 

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.940
 you bought a smartphone 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.119
 uncomfortable virtual keyboard 

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:09.979
 and if you still need to constantly text 

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:10.659
 to recruit 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:12.779
 one thing if a few words about Samara 

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.809
 write another when you sit for example in 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.849
 uni attacked and write classes 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:17.779
 sports 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:18.769
 which exit 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:21.220
 right mini keyboard 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.910
 only here they stand as half 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.419
 smartphones but fortunately not all 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.050
 today i will introduce you like this 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.329
 keyboards for mobile devices 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.040
 rutube commitment oyrba zero yen 20 all 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.640
 bank 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.040
 you 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.040
 let's start from April 6 of this year 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.790
 on the site of the laborer it is described that she 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.820
 especially for the edge of the stalemate but fine 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.450
 work with iphone 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.970
 in principle, work normally with 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.580
 set just to teach 8.50 language 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.490
 will have to get convenience for your 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.910
 there is no convenience in barcelona today 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.079
 but generally officially given roam devices 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.399
 there will be separate cars 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.479
 the most important advantage of size 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:06.330
 suspension thickness is one of the most 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.850
 world's thinnest wireless keyboard 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.610
 there it is all pretty high quality 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.659
 metal shrapnel made 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.439
 construction is not at all those who can 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:15.400
 seem 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.760
 plus it works for about a month since 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.950
 how to use will be recharged 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.900
 from rostov mikhail bezruk two hours 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.490
 canadian and just 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.140
 project includes hindu 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.909
 then turn on the keyboard itself then you 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.890
 will ask for 2011 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.310
 but also in Kent's platoon 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.570
 and all the prosecutor's office is connected 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.580
 that's work 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.410
 with subsequent connections already 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.250
 nothing will just enter 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.750
 enable keyboards 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.900
 but all this is no good if the device 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.290
 won't be comfortable 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.100
 here due to the size you can even 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.140
 take the animals print them will cause 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.150
 I would certainly work on 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.620
 helicopter 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.260
 that didn't really like it then 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.540
 that in the year these three buttons came to 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.920
 Minsk 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.130
 but this is not a problem you can get used to 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.789
 much less convenient is that here here 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.140
 this blog is much smaller than 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.129
 rest 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.239
 although in principle, over time, this problem 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:12.659
 stop it 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:14.680
 The keyboard works great for example 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.499
 all these keyboard shortcuts which 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:17.879
 work in production she 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:18.949
 supported 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:21.649
 be able to speak anton space 

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:25.079
 there copy complex and so on 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.909
 FIFA version can be included in your 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.299
 car and for example block 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:30.409
 devices 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:31.549
 very comfortably 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.299
 input buttons of length they are well pressed and 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.169
 it is really comfortable 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:37.739
 keyboard exist as with 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.639
 in deed and in black 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.789
 now move on to another keyboard 

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:45.249
 visually almost the same as 63 2 0 a 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:47.869
 just chepak but it's not quite like that 

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:49.399
 the keyboard is no longer just for that 

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:52.089
 the device of this song it works fine 

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:54.449
 this keyboard can be issued as sponge it 

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:56.309
 not so with laptops and ordinary 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:58.649
 computers and even televisions 

00:02:58.649 --> 00:03:01.329
 so from here and all know vodka such as 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.449
 in Moscow and so forth appeared to everyone 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:05.669
 familiar windows mehmata context 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:06.189
 menu 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:07.560
 but the similarities remain 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.250
 these three letters are also below and this one 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.299
 key block is smaller than the main 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.680
 plus the size of the buttons know the same 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.049
 putting them on has not changed a canadian a 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.189
 at dinner Chelyabmetrostroy 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:19.889
 Martas using wireless 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.519
 technology at a frequency of 2 4 gigahertz 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.209
 while working more than 70 meters 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.430
 it is powered by two type batteries 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.529
 and under the 3rd floor 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:30.770
 the cruiser is hiding here such a pocket 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.129
 so don't lose 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:33.779
 move touchpads 

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:35.000
 principle of the century he 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.430
 not small so it will work 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.519
 comfortable 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.779
 but there is no click to push but everything is not so simple 

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:44.339
 Multitouch is working here this year. 

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:46.739
 two clicks as right click 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.379
 one click 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.199
 like left men button 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:53.279
 And here is such a movement with your fingers as 

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:54.640
 food 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.080
 I really liked it because 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.669
 what is it really comfortable 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:03:59.969
 failing that i won't say that honestly i don't 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:01.809
 use such devices before 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:03.769
 how did you get acquainted with the attempt at first not 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.439
 could think of why a person should buy it 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:08.169
 but then I remembered how many times 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:10.019
 fixed the smartphone saying that 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.299
 uncomfortable virtual keyboard and immediately 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.129
 thought about the payment method problem 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.989
 is decided 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.039
 and people who constantly work with 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.609
 tablets they have to type 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.639
 text is more convenient to work with 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.680
 such a deplorable situation 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.620
 and from March on which we now say 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.620
 TV so I will say that the addressee 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.360
 only have to recruit me 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.659
 throws more severely 

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:31.419
 but how much more convenient to take this one 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.899
 keyboard and type the address or note that 

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:36.099
 then from the screen of the Terek or write that 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:37.999
 VKontakte much easier to manage 

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:40.559
 any device in which it is not 

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:41.590
 likes sport 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.800
 even by computer 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.150
 included serialchik village alloys on the sofa and 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.030
 no need to walk end every 20 minutes in general 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.030
 honestly in my opinion is 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.550
 Moscow device for those who love good 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:53.909
 wireless do 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:55.939
 that's all with you was online store 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:57.319
