bull elk this smaller else getting a VHF
radio<00:01:18.900> cover<00:01:19.640> and<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:20.790> allows<00:01:21.090> us<00:01:21.330> just<00:01:21.690> to

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
radio cover and this allows us just to

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.560 
radio cover and this allows us just to
to<00:01:22.830> know<00:01:22.979> when<00:01:23.190> he's<00:01:23.310> alive<00:01:23.580> or<00:01:23.640> dead<00:01:24.000> it's

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
although we're gonna use this collar for

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.930 
although we're gonna use this collar for
and<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:28.920> he'll<00:01:29.100> eventually<00:01:29.190> in<00:01:29.580> a<00:01:29.640> year<00:01:29.820> or<00:01:29.850> two

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
and so he'll eventually in a year or two

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.260 
and so he'll eventually in a year or two
grow<00:01:30.360> into<00:01:30.979> go<00:01:31.979> into<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> nice<00:01:32.490> Bowl<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.119> can

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
grow into go into a nice Bowl and we can

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.390 
grow into go into a nice Bowl and we can
track<00:01:33.509> him<00:01:33.690> by<00:01:34.229> tracking<00:01:34.530> for<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.830> next<00:01:35.100> two

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
track him by tracking for the next two

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.790 
track him by tracking for the next two

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
put on now they'll last for how long of

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.430 
put on now they'll last for how long of
really<00:01:41.970> five<00:01:42.149> to<00:01:42.300> six<00:01:42.479> years<00:01:42.720> okay<00:01:43.229> they<00:01:43.350> have

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
a battery in them yeah and so basically

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.889 
a battery in them yeah and so basically
when<00:01:46.800> that<00:01:47.009> animal<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.640> down<00:01:47.940> and<00:01:48.300> not<00:01:48.509> moving

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
when that animal is down and not moving

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.060 
when that animal is down and not moving
for<00:01:49.080> a<00:01:49.110> long<00:01:49.259> period<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.560> time<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.830> that<00:01:49.860> what

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
for a long period of time is that what

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.499 
for a long period of time is that what
tells<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.490> animals<00:01:50.820> yeah<00:01:50.970> it'll<00:01:51.330> it'll

are sensing enough that if I get that

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:13.850 
are sensing enough that if I get that
beep<00:02:04.830> it's<00:02:05.039> usually<00:02:05.220> a<00:02:05.399> dead<00:02:05.610> elk

I<00:02:28.420> have<00:02:28.690> is<00:02:28.870> they're<00:02:28.990> gonna<00:02:29.080> grow<00:02:29.350> into<00:02:29.620> a<00:02:29.890> bull

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
I have is they're gonna grow into a bull

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.370 
I have is they're gonna grow into a bull
that<00:02:30.220> a<00:02:30.490> Kentucky<00:02:30.970> hunter<00:02:31.240> would<00:02:31.420> be<00:02:31.600> not<00:02:32.200> that

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
that a Kentucky hunter would be not that

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.600 
that a Kentucky hunter would be not that
that's<00:02:32.500> a<00:02:32.680> bad<00:02:32.710> bull<00:02:33.130> but<00:02:33.340> they're<00:02:33.430> gonna<00:02:33.550> be

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
that's a bad bull but they're gonna be

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.000 
that's a bad bull but they're gonna be
nice<00:02:33.910> Bulls<00:02:34.270> in<00:02:34.510> two<00:02:34.660> years<00:02:34.960> I<00:02:35.230> still<00:02:35.620> be<00:02:35.800> part

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
nice Bulls in two years I still be part

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.790 
nice Bulls in two years I still be part
of<00:02:36.070> this<00:02:36.190> study<00:02:36.460> so<00:02:37.360> let's<00:02:38.350> talk<00:02:38.500> about<00:02:38.620> the

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
of this study so let's talk about the

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.260 
of this study so let's talk about the
fact<00:02:39.010> that<00:02:39.130> there's<00:02:39.820> gonna<00:02:39.910> be<00:02:40.060> a<00:02:40.090> lot<00:02:40.240> of

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
fact that there's gonna be a lot of

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.900 
fact that there's gonna be a lot of
hunters<00:02:40.630> out<00:02:41.230> there<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:42.070> I<00:02:42.460> was<00:02:42.610> talking<00:02:42.700> with

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
hunters out there and I was talking with

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.060 
hunters out there and I was talking with
the<00:02:42.970> guy<00:02:43.060> not<00:02:43.210> too<00:02:43.360> long<00:02:43.540> ago<00:02:43.600> who<00:02:44.140> saw<00:02:44.560> Colin

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
the guy not too long ago who saw Colin

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.700 
the guy not too long ago who saw Colin
thought<00:02:45.540> he<00:02:46.540> didn't<00:02:47.110> he<00:02:47.170> didn't<00:02:47.380> have<00:02:47.470> a<00:02:47.500> real

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
thought he didn't he didn't have a real

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:48.960 
thought he didn't he didn't have a real
good<00:02:47.860> feeling<00:02:48.070> but<00:02:48.280> he<00:02:48.430> didn't<00:02:48.640> know<00:02:48.700> exactly

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
good feeling but he didn't know exactly

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.660 
good feeling but he didn't know exactly
what<00:02:49.210> was<00:02:49.330> going<00:02:49.480> on<00:02:49.660> now<00:02:50.350> if<00:02:50.650> a<00:02:50.860> hunter<00:02:51.100> sees

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
what was going on now if a hunter sees

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.270 
what was going on now if a hunter sees
an<00:02:52.180> elk<00:02:52.480> out<00:02:52.690> there<00:02:52.870> with<00:02:52.960> a<00:02:53.020> collar<00:02:53.230> on<00:02:53.350> we're

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
an elk out there with a collar on we're

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.590 
an elk out there with a collar on we're
not<00:02:54.430> gonna<00:02:54.610> discourage<00:02:55.030> him<00:02:55.210> from<00:02:55.240> shooting

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
not gonna discourage him from shooting

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.750 
not gonna discourage him from shooting
that<00:02:55.690> oh<00:02:55.840> no<00:02:56.110> definitely<00:02:56.410> not<00:02:56.740> the<00:02:56.920> biggest

source of mortality for Kentucky bulls
are<00:02:59.800> hunters<00:03:00.130> right<00:03:00.580> of<00:03:01.210> the<00:03:01.360> 67<00:03:01.960> I<00:03:02.050> had

that animal man and you don't have to
have<00:03:07.930> met<00:03:08.110> it<00:03:08.230> with<00:03:08.320> a<00:03:08.410> collar<00:03:08.620> on<00:03:08.800> there<00:03:08.980> no

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
I usually come and find my collar

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.000 
I usually come and find my collar
exactly

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.490 

now<00:03:20.849> today<00:03:21.360> you<00:03:21.390> did<00:03:21.750> you<00:03:21.900> did<00:03:22.020> a<00:03:22.050> variety<00:03:22.230> of

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
now today you did you did a variety of

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.930 
now today you did you did a variety of
things<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:22.890> pull<00:03:23.069> the<00:03:23.190> tooth<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:23.580> that's<00:03:23.730> for

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
things you pull the tooth and that's for

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.670 
things you pull the tooth and that's for
age<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.420> explain<00:03:24.690> how<00:03:24.989> they<00:03:25.140> do<00:03:25.200> that<00:03:25.410> if<00:03:25.590> you

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
age and explain how they do that if you

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.250 
age and explain how they do that if you
uh<00:03:25.739> um<00:03:26.580> so<00:03:27.000> with<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.269> age<00:03:27.450> we<00:03:27.750> pull<00:03:27.959> a<00:03:27.989> tooth

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
uh um so with the age we pull a tooth

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.080 
uh um so with the age we pull a tooth
and<00:03:28.530> we<00:03:28.590> send<00:03:28.830> it<00:03:28.950> there's<00:03:29.069> one<00:03:29.129> lab<00:03:29.430> in<00:03:29.730> the

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
and we send it there's one lab in the

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.240 
and we send it there's one lab in the
u.s.<00:03:30.390> that<00:03:30.660> does<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:31.140> does<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.440> work<00:03:31.650> they

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
u.s. that does that does the work they

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.920 
u.s. that does that does the work they
basically<00:03:32.519> just<00:03:32.670> section<00:03:33.330> it<00:03:33.450> like<00:03:33.599> you<00:03:33.750> would

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
basically just section it like you would

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.800 
basically just section it like you would
uh<00:03:33.989> like<00:03:34.800> a<00:03:34.860> histology<00:03:35.580> sample<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:36.239> then<00:03:36.660> look

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
uh like a histology sample and then look

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.420 
uh like a histology sample and then look
at<00:03:36.930> it<00:03:37.050> under<00:03:37.140> a<00:03:37.260> microscope<00:03:37.290> it's<00:03:38.130> not<00:03:38.280> as

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
at it under a microscope it's not as

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.120 
at it under a microscope it's not as
well-defined<00:03:39.180> to<00:03:39.599> say<00:03:39.780> tree<00:03:40.050> rings<00:03:40.349> but<00:03:41.010> it's

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
well-defined to say tree rings but it's

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.120 
well-defined to say tree rings but it's
got<00:03:41.310> rings<00:03:41.970> at<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.360> account<00:03:42.830> did<00:03:43.830> you<00:03:43.920> take

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
got rings at the account did you take

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.309 
got rings at the account did you take
blood<00:03:44.480> what<00:03:45.480> do<00:03:45.540> you<00:03:45.630> look<00:03:45.720> for<00:03:45.930> with<00:03:46.230> the

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
blood what do you look for with the

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.780 
blood what do you look for with the
blood<00:03:46.410> stuff<00:03:46.739> we're<00:03:46.950> just<00:03:47.130> basically<00:03:47.280> doing

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
blood stuff we're just basically doing

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.520 
blood stuff we're just basically doing
like<00:03:47.940> a<00:03:47.970> blood<00:03:48.299> panel<00:03:48.569> like<00:03:48.930> if<00:03:49.049> you<00:03:49.200> went<00:03:49.379> to

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
like a blood panel like if you went to

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.470 
like a blood panel like if you went to
the<00:03:49.620> lab<00:03:49.799> to<00:03:50.010> have<00:03:50.129> blood<00:03:50.370> work<00:03:50.400> done<00:03:50.790> that's

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
the lab to have blood work done that's

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.089 
the lab to have blood work done that's
what<00:03:51.660> we're<00:03:51.810> doing<00:03:52.080> looking<00:03:52.290> at<00:03:52.380> all<00:03:52.500> you<00:03:52.980> know

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
what we're doing looking at all you know

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.160 
what we're doing looking at all you know
different<00:03:53.790> different<00:03:54.540> parts<00:03:54.750> of<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.930> blood

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
different different parts of the blood

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.470 
different different parts of the blood
and<00:03:55.440> what<00:03:55.769> ratios<00:03:56.190> they're<00:03:56.459> in<00:03:56.700> and<00:03:57.030> that<00:03:57.239> just

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
and what ratios they're in and that just

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.910 
and what ratios they're in and that just
gives<00:03:57.660> us<00:03:57.750> an<00:03:57.900> idea<00:03:58.200> of<00:03:58.230> whether<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:58.590> bull<00:03:58.769> was

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
gives us an idea of whether the bull was

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.949 
gives us an idea of whether the bull was
normal<00:03:59.340> or<00:03:59.849> whether<00:04:00.030> it<00:04:00.150> might<00:04:00.269> be<00:04:00.329> abnormal

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
normal or whether it might be abnormal

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.110

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
parasite count and that gives us an idea

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.789 
parasite count and that gives us an idea
of<00:04:15.269> just<00:04:15.329> what<00:04:15.989> kind<00:04:16.169> of<00:04:16.200> parasite<00:04:16.590> load

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799

they've got they've all got parasites

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.730 
they've got they've all got parasites
but<00:04:18.989> not<00:04:19.139> in<00:04:19.260> a<00:04:19.290> bad<00:04:19.320> way

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.110 

also<00:04:22.740> gonna<00:04:22.919> ultrasound<00:04:23.490> we<00:04:23.639> measured<00:04:23.910> rump

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
also gonna ultrasound we measured rump

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.689 
also gonna ultrasound we measured rump
fat<00:04:24.360> and<00:04:24.680> basically<00:04:25.680> tenderloin<00:04:26.220> thickness

just<00:04:26.940> is<00:04:27.509> a<00:04:27.539> little<00:04:27.780> more<00:04:27.990> precise<00:04:28.349> measure<00:04:28.710> of

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
just is a little more precise measure of

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.710 
just is a little more precise measure of
you<00:04:29.880> know<00:04:30.000> how<00:04:30.419> healthy<00:04:30.810> this<00:04:30.930> bull<00:04:31.169> is<00:04:32.720> what

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
you know how healthy this bull is what

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.529 
you know how healthy this bull is what
is<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:33.990> average<00:04:34.139> lifespan<00:04:34.830> of<00:04:35.160> a<00:04:35.849> bull<00:04:36.090> elk<00:04:36.300> if
