00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.640 
look like two fish
and<00:02:14.120> also<00:02:14.390> you<00:02:14.599> got<00:02:14.780> like<00:02:14.989> this<00:02:15.140> sort<00:02:15.409> of<00:02:15.470> thing

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
and also you got like this sort of thing

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.039 
and also you got like this sort of thing
going<00:02:15.860> on<00:02:16.010> here<00:02:16.069> and<00:02:16.459> I<00:02:17.420> think<00:02:17.690> it's<00:02:17.810> time<00:02:18.019> to

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
going on here and I think it's time to

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:23.949 
going on here and I think it's time to
turn<00:02:18.290> around<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:22.610> if<00:02:23.120> I<00:02:23.269> just<00:02:23.510> moving<00:02:23.810> forward

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
turn around and if I just moving forward

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.100 
turn around and if I just moving forward
a<00:02:24.140> bit<00:02:24.290> so<00:02:24.530> that<00:02:24.560> you<00:02:24.830> can<00:02:25.010> see<00:02:25.340> in<00:02:26.030> there<00:02:26.420> in

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
a bit so that you can see in there in

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.009 
a bit so that you can see in there in
there<00:02:27.440> is<00:02:27.830> symbol<00:02:28.790> for<00:02:29.090> metal<00:02:30.129> in<00:02:31.129> there<00:02:31.430> and

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
there is symbol for metal in there and

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.410 
there is symbol for metal in there and
again<00:02:33.019> you<00:02:33.829> also<00:02:34.010> have<00:02:34.430> that<00:02:34.790> sort<00:02:35.150> of<00:02:35.180> like

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
again you also have that sort of like

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.479 
again you also have that sort of like
metal<00:02:36.319> belt<00:02:36.590> thing<00:02:36.860> that<00:02:37.099> you<00:02:37.190> had<00:02:37.280> on<00:02:37.310> the
