your text now the way that after effects
actually<00:02:26.320> animates<00:02:26.860> things<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:28.720> that<00:02:28.780> you

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
actually animates things is that you

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.740 
actually animates things is that you
choose<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.680> key<00:02:29.950> frames<00:02:30.510> which<00:02:31.510> are<00:02:31.630> the

put a keyframe here and i'm going to
start<00:02:45.160> animating<00:02:46.260> so<00:02:47.260> let's<00:02:47.470> say<00:02:47.620> we<00:02:48.330> have

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
start animating so let's say we have

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:58.250 
start animating so let's say we have
that<00:02:49.570> done<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:51.300> we<00:02:52.300> want<00:02:52.750> our<00:02:53.080> text<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:56.220> start

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
that done and we want our text to start

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.170 
that done and we want our text to start
invisible<00:02:59.260> so<00:02:59.860> when<00:02:59.980> i<00:03:00.010> set<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.280> opacity<00:03:00.370> is<00:03:00.850> 0

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
invisible so when i set the opacity is 0

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.750 
invisible so when i set the opacity is 0
what<00:03:02.080> i<00:03:02.110> can<00:03:02.350> do<00:03:02.500> that<00:03:02.530> first<00:03:03.100> the<00:03:03.310> first<00:03:03.580> thing

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
what i can do that first the first thing

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.790 
what i can do that first the first thing
we're<00:03:03.880> going<00:03:03.970> to<00:03:04.030> do<00:03:04.180> is<00:03:04.570> we<00:03:05.380> want<00:03:05.410> it<00:03:05.590> to<00:03:05.620> kind

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
we're going to do is we want it to kind

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.920 
we're going to do is we want it to kind
of<00:03:05.920> rotate<00:03:06.400> in<00:03:06.670> so<00:03:07.360> you<00:03:07.450> can<00:03:07.540> kind<00:03:07.690> of<00:03:07.720> play<00:03:07.840> at

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
of rotate in so you can kind of play at

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.390 
of rotate in so you can kind of play at
the<00:03:08.020> sliders<00:03:08.910> say<00:03:09.910> okay<00:03:10.690> and<00:03:11.020> my<00:03:11.470> text<00:03:11.860> is<00:03:12.010> down

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
the sliders say okay and my text is down

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.300 
the sliders say okay and my text is down
here<00:03:12.790> that's<00:03:13.630> kind<00:03:13.840> of<00:03:13.870> coming<00:03:14.050> forward<00:03:14.410> you

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
here that's kind of coming forward you

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.430 
here that's kind of coming forward you
can<00:03:15.490> have<00:03:15.670> it<00:03:16.260> each<00:03:18.870> so<00:03:19.870> I'm<00:03:19.930> going<00:03:20.080> to<00:03:20.140> flip<00:03:20.320> it

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
can have it each so I'm going to flip it

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.580 
can have it each so I'm going to flip it
over<00:03:20.560> almost<00:03:20.860> 180<00:03:21.460> degrees<00:03:21.820> and<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:23.290> Z

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
over almost 180 degrees and the Z

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.200 
over almost 180 degrees and the Z
rotation<00:03:23.800> is<00:03:24.460> like<00:03:24.640> that<00:03:25.030> it's<00:03:26.020> kind<00:03:26.230> of<00:03:26.260> cool

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
rotation is like that it's kind of cool

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.530 
rotation is like that it's kind of cool
and<00:03:28.260> then<00:03:29.910> we're<00:03:30.910> going<00:03:31.000> to<00:03:31.060> also<00:03:31.240> set<00:03:31.510> the

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
and then we're going to also set the

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.950 
and then we're going to also set the
opacity<00:03:31.720> 20<00:03:32.880> so<00:03:33.880> now<00:03:34.000> is<00:03:34.150> invisible<00:03:34.570> to<00:03:34.630> start

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:34.960 
opacity 20 so now is invisible to start

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.350 
opacity 20 so now is invisible to start
with<00:03:35.370> so<00:03:36.370> let's<00:03:36.490> move<00:03:36.670> our<00:03:36.850> slider<00:03:37.300> over<00:03:37.690> here

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
with so let's move our slider over here

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.520 
with so let's move our slider over here
25<00:03:40.360> seconds<00:03:40.870> and<00:03:42.180> set<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.270> opacity<00:03:43.360> to<00:03:43.960> one

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
25 seconds and set the opacity to one

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.060 
25 seconds and set the opacity to one
hundred<00:03:44.710> percent<00:03:44.920> and<00:03:46.080> all<00:03:47.080> of<00:03:47.350> our<00:03:47.470> rotations

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
hundred percent and all of our rotations

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.940 
hundred percent and all of our rotations
20<00:03:48.520> so<00:03:48.790> now<00:03:48.910> it's<00:03:49.060> in<00:03:49.120> its<00:03:49.240> normal<00:03:49.420> position<00:03:49.950> it

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
20 so now it's in its normal position it

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.310 
20 so now it's in its normal position it
so<00:03:51.010> if<00:03:51.220> you<00:03:51.310> look<00:03:51.520> real<00:03:51.850> closely<00:03:52.260> you<00:03:53.260> can

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
so if you look real closely you can

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
so if you look real closely you can
watch<00:03:53.740> it

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.490 

come<00:03:58.340> into<00:03:58.549> play<00:03:58.730> just<00:03:59.599> kind<00:03:59.750> of<00:03:59.780> cool<00:03:59.959> you<00:04:00.200> go

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
come into play just kind of cool you go

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.899 
come into play just kind of cool you go
back<00:04:00.680> to<00:04:00.709> the<00:04:00.829> beginning<00:04:00.950> there's<00:04:01.489> a<00:04:01.579> space

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:01.909 
back to the beginning there's a space

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:07.750 
back to the beginning there's a space
bar<00:04:02.180> to<00:04:02.480> watch<00:04:03.049> it<00:04:03.379> in<00:04:03.590> real<00:04:03.980> time<00:04:06.549> that's<00:04:07.549> kind

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
bar to watch it in real time that's kind

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.140 
bar to watch it in real time that's kind
of<00:04:07.790> cool

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
of cool

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.780 
of cool
alright<00:04:09.930> so<00:04:10.200> kind<00:04:10.799> of<00:04:10.890> created<00:04:11.220> our<00:04:11.340> test<00:04:11.610> to

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
alright so kind of created our test to

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.470 
alright so kind of created our test to
begin<00:04:12.090> with<00:04:12.269> and<00:04:12.450> now<00:04:12.510> let's<00:04:13.319> say<00:04:14.269> you<00:04:15.269> want

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
begin with and now let's say you want

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.370 
begin with and now let's say you want
our<00:04:15.569> text<00:04:15.900> to<00:04:16.049> move<00:04:16.380> around<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.949> screen<00:04:17.009> and

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
our text to move around the screen and

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.219 
our text to move around the screen and
change<00:04:19.380> color<00:04:19.829> as<00:04:20.130> it<00:04:20.519> moves<00:04:20.729> around<00:04:20.910> and<00:04:21.449> then

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
change color as it moves around and then

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.350 
change color as it moves around and then
fly<00:04:22.470> off<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.800> screen<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.310> end<00:04:23.460> and<00:04:23.820> it<00:04:24.270> will

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
fly off the screen the end and it will

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.600 
fly off the screen the end and it will
kind<00:04:24.509> of<00:04:24.630> move<00:04:24.750> into<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:24.990> next<00:04:25.080> aircraft<00:04:25.610> so

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
kind of move into the next aircraft so

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.469 
kind of move into the next aircraft so
we're<00:04:26.850> going<00:04:26.970> to<00:04:27.060> hit<00:04:27.150> add<00:04:27.889> property<00:04:29.479> position

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
we're going to hit add property position

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:40.310 
we're going to hit add property position
and<00:04:30.949> add<00:04:31.949> property<00:04:32.699> bill<00:04:33.389> color<00:04:33.720> RGB<00:04:34.350> and<00:04:39.320> once

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
and add property bill color RGB and once

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.779 
and add property bill color RGB and once
again<00:04:40.440> we're<00:04:40.650> going<00:04:40.740> to<00:04:40.889> put<00:04:41.039> the<00:04:41.160> stopwatches

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
again we're going to put the stopwatches

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:45.080 
again we're going to put the stopwatches
on<00:04:42.090> both<00:04:42.330> of<00:04:42.449> these<00:04:42.690> and<00:04:43.639> start<00:04:44.639> with<00:04:44.760> the<00:04:44.850> fill

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
on both of these and start with the fill

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.960 
on both of these and start with the fill
color<00:04:45.120> of<00:04:45.570> white<00:04:46.490> all<00:04:47.490> right<00:04:47.610> let's<00:04:47.760> say<00:04:47.850> we

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
color of white all right let's say we

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.610 
color of white all right let's say we
want<00:04:48.180> every<00:04:48.539> second<00:04:49.050> we<00:04:49.110> wanted<00:04:49.380> to<00:04:49.410> move

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
want every second we wanted to move

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.439 
want every second we wanted to move
around<00:04:49.830> we're<00:04:50.610> going<00:04:50.699> to<00:04:50.760> head<00:04:50.880> over<00:04:50.910> 6

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
around we're going to head over 6

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:54.020 
around we're going to head over 6
seconds<00:04:51.900> here<00:04:52.199> and<00:04:53.070> you<00:04:53.220> notice<00:04:53.370> the<00:04:53.580> position

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
seconds here and you notice the position

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.020 
seconds here and you notice the position
starts<00:04:54.360> at<00:04:54.479> 0<00:04:54.750> 0<00:04:55.050> 0<00:04:55.080> which<00:04:56.010> is<00:04:56.250> the<00:04:56.580> initial

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
starts at 0 0 0 which is the initial

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.909 
starts at 0 0 0 which is the initial
position<00:04:57.600> that<00:04:58.050> you<00:04:58.199> sent<00:04:58.500> texts<00:04:58.919> at<00:04:59.070> and<00:05:00.919> we

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
position that you sent texts at and we

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.879 
position that you sent texts at and we
can<00:05:02.430> choose<00:05:03.120> they<00:05:03.630> want<00:05:03.870> to<00:05:03.960> be<00:05:04.139> yellow<00:05:04.680> will

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
can choose they want to be yellow will

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.120 
can choose they want to be yellow will
kind<00:05:05.070> of<00:05:05.099> move<00:05:05.310> up<00:05:05.430> the<00:05:05.550> spectrum<00:05:06.030> and<00:05:06.889> then<00:05:07.889> if

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
kind of move up the spectrum and then if

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.250 
kind of move up the spectrum and then if
we<00:05:08.250> have<00:05:08.400> this<00:05:08.580> selected<00:05:09.479> we<00:05:10.050> can

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
we have this selected we can

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:28.300 
we have this selected we can
year<00:05:13.290> move<00:05:14.290> it<00:05:14.410> over<00:05:14.500> here<00:05:15.120> for<00:05:16.120> the<00:05:16.180> position

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:35.800 

ok

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:45.350 

and

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:58.860 

okay<00:05:45.960> so

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.750 

okay<00:05:59.620> you<00:05:59.830> actually<00:06:00.010> have<00:06:00.310> to<00:06:00.430> have<00:06:00.460> it

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
okay you actually have to have it

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.580 
okay you actually have to have it
selected

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.140 

so<00:06:05.590> let's<00:06:05.710> try<00:06:05.890> this<00:06:05.950> again<00:06:06.130> wanting<00:06:06.910> to<00:06:06.940> list

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
so let's try this again wanting to list

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.480 
so let's try this again wanting to list
with<00:06:07.330> position<00:06:07.750> down<00:06:07.900> there<00:06:08.200> that's<00:06:09.100> six

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
with position down there that's six

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.460 
with position down there that's six
seconds<00:06:09.880> we<00:06:10.000> can<00:06:10.150> put<00:06:10.300> the<00:06:10.360> position<00:06:10.720> up<00:06:10.810> here

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
seconds we can put the position up here

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.540 
seconds we can put the position up here
and<00:06:11.680> then<00:06:12.610> let's<00:06:12.790> say<00:06:13.000> at<00:06:13.180> seven<00:06:13.870> seconds<00:06:14.550> all

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
and then let's say at seven seconds all

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.310 
and then let's say at seven seconds all
right<00:06:15.700> nine<00:06:16.270> seconds<00:06:16.720> we<00:06:16.810> actually<00:06:17.110> want<00:06:17.230> to

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
right nine seconds we actually want to

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.220 
right nine seconds we actually want to
put<00:06:17.470> it<00:06:17.530> back<00:06:17.770> to<00:06:18.010> zero<00:06:18.370> and<00:06:19.240> you<00:06:19.360> can<00:06:19.540> do<00:06:19.780> so<00:06:20.020> by

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:20.230 
put it back to zero and you can do so by

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:25.050 
put it back to zero and you can do so by
doing<00:06:20.290> this<00:06:22.980> but<00:06:23.980> let's<00:06:24.130> say<00:06:24.280> that<00:06:24.370> each<00:06:24.700> one

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
doing this but let's say that each one

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.870 
doing this but let's say that each one
of<00:06:25.120> those<00:06:25.330> we<00:06:25.540> want<00:06:25.690> the<00:06:25.810> color<00:06:26.050> to<00:06:26.230> change<00:06:26.880> so

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 
of those we want the color to change so

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.570 
of those we want the color to change so
we<00:06:28.030> can<00:06:28.180> head<00:06:28.360> back<00:06:28.570> over<00:06:28.750> here<00:06:29.370> change<00:06:30.370> the

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
we can head back over here change the

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.200 
we can head back over here change the
fill<00:06:30.790> color<00:06:30.820> let's<00:06:31.330> make<00:06:31.510> Kareem<00:06:32.080> this<00:06:32.230> time

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
fill color let's make Kareem this time

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:41.700 
fill color let's make Kareem this time
and<00:06:35.340> over<00:06:36.340> to<00:06:36.900> here<00:06:40.080> let's<00:06:41.080> make<00:06:41.200> the<00:06:41.500> fill

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
and over to here let's make the fill

and over to here let's make the fill
color<00:06:41.760> blue<00:06:42.760> this<00:06:43.090> time<00:06:43.590> try<00:06:44.590> switching<00:06:44.890> it

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160 
color blue this time try switching it

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:51.510 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:55.010 

and<00:06:51.930> change<00:06:52.290> the<00:06:52.470> color<00:06:52.710> red<00:06:53.130> and<00:06:54.020> then

00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.880 

actually<00:06:59.720> have<00:06:59.840> to<00:06:59.960> head<00:07:00.080> back<00:07:00.110> to<00:07:00.230> Center<00:07:00.650> I

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:00.890 
actually have to head back to Center I

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.100 
actually have to head back to Center I
moved<00:07:01.130> it<00:07:01.220> down<00:07:01.250> and<00:07:02.210> so<00:07:02.390> let's<00:07:02.570> say<00:07:02.690> at<00:07:02.780> ten

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.110 
moved it down and so let's say at ten

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.780 
moved it down and so let's say at ten
seconds<00:07:03.620> we<00:07:03.740> just<00:07:03.920> moved<00:07:04.100> it<00:07:04.220> off<00:07:04.340> the<00:07:04.520> board

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:04.790 
seconds we just moved it off the board

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.100 
seconds we just moved it off the board
