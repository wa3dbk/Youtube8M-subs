00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.570
 fano action June 9th customer 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.640
 quite pissed off about the lack 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:23.150
 of the frecciarossa stop 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:25.939
 95 94 for milano buongiorno she had to 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.289
 travel on the 95 94 from fano to milan yes 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:34.519
 absolutely yes 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:36.949
 and the 17 25 yes incidence I went 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:38.449
 almost by mistake but applied to the stage 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.430
 learned from the press 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:41.870
 especially because I have inquired 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.460
 switch administration with another 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.739
 personal reason having to buy a 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.280
 another ticket because the train planned 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.930
 more stop tonight at 59 not 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.910
 would be stopped by fans and therefore I have to 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.800
 reach weight with another meter not 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.510
 I say luck because there are trains 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.039
 but community lengthening a time of 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.879
 distance compared to what it was 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.340
 expected 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.469
 ok and the protection station there 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.110
 Instead he gave the station is 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.970
 pressed was absolutely not receive 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.070
 the posters there was no kind of 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.200
 additional fine information could 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.970
 please contact the ticket type 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.380
 protection had been reported of 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.300
 take one of these trains for 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.700
 reach pesaro these local trains 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.470
 mature having paid however a 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.520
 first class full price ticket 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.640
 because I bought it in the last ones 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.500
 days so obviously today I am 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.630
 found by chance even from three stations 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.250
 weather forecast or station before but 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.899
 frankly they buy the continuation of the 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.430
 season having to take this for 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.800
 use this route several times 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.620
 they become quite inconvenient 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.480
 ok thanks thanks here is another one 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.160
 passenger at the station or by chance 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.620
 he must also take the red arrow 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.270
 for milan but it's not just me eh there is 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.400
 so many people who have to take an arrow 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.320
 red for me 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.700
 and what did they tell him at the station 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.650
 instead national told me that I 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.170
 they would have taken Pesaro by shuttle 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.480
 then from in frecciabianca to bologna 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.690
 and then from bologna I should have taken 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.120
 high speed that will serve I paid 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.070
 full price because purchased 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.570
 last days I have to travel with three 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.540
 regional service levels 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:14.330
 frecciabianca but what a shame that 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.310
 shame and there is no announcement is not there 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.550
 an announcement but what is the point of paying the 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.230
 shuttle to pesaro there are six trains but there 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.810
 say why this such by 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.500
 stop but apart from that there is 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.209
 shame on this shame on you 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.490
 big problem is that in station a 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.910
 part at the ticket office there is no type 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:42.100
 of cartel anywhere you announce 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:44.510
 this last-minute change then 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.630
 here we are the station of fano of have 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.920
 also found roberto zaffini 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.430
 regional councilor of the region 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.830
 brands that promoted the red arrow 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.989
 on the Adriatic line and especially the 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.050
 red arrow for tourists who had to 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.489
 start today with the fano stop 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.080
 what roberto really tells us 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.569
 exciting to be here to participate 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.330
 this colossal bin is as always 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.870
 we can not 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.870
 on guard 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.690
 I've seen scenes 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.370
 past during the tourist season of 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.290
 that they couldn't get into the trains 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.500
 tourist but remained on the ground with 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.630
 great discomfort with illnesses with 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.550
 truly an indescribable hardship today 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.040
 must be say the inauguration of 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.300
 this of this new possibility 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.700
 tourist for fano and but also for 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.640
 riccione cattolica and senigallia 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.250
 unfortunately we have reconfirmed it 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.560
 that we are in the area the area 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.600
 Adriatic really treated to fish in 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.460
 unfortunately then do this colossal 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.140
 bin will still be a struggle for us 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.690
 stimulus to always be able to do something 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.670
 for our territory because 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.440
 we repeat they make third city of the brands 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.750
 a very important road junction is 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.740
 however the whole Adriatic coast comes 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.990
 penalized by this policy he sees 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.700
 would seem to see inserted in this 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.490
 treats forlì that we can't 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.069
 absolutely understand why 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.920
 while the 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.540
 peculiarly tourist areas on the sea 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.389
 are penalized 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.090
 we will then be the spokesman of being able to 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:19.009
 at least ask for a recovery 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.959
 of these weekend stops 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:23.090
 at least this and I think it is the 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.360
 minimum speech that trenitalia should 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.759
 to give to the citizens of the coast 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.380
 Adriatic and who carries out an activity of the 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:31.880
 tourism because it is really with the 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.419
 present especially in times of crisis 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.550
 and we also claim a capacity that 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.440
 business is also done by promoting of 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.560
 promotion we have seen very little 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.590
 as if they had announced here 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.690
 opening a store and then the 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.330
 there is no moment of inauguration 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:53.349
 product therefore really a bin goes 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.349
 fine, thanks 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.680
 it must have been a summer train 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:05.040
 absolutely nothing this stop and the 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.970
 they have 1234 surprises also called 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.500
 senigallia fano and catholic and riccione 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:13.160
 much more useful since it was the train 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.160
 of the sea 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.970
 full house at the forlì station 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.720
 Milan
