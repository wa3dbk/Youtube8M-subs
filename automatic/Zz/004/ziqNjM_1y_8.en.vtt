00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.860
 so hello people and welcome to one 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:18.690
 little video about the presentation 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:22.260
 sapphire radeon in 1980, she extreme it 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.919
 is an amd card with a lot of power for 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.460
 I'll give you a little money in one now 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:31.340
 to show a little review in more detail 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:35.310
 and I have this card myself 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:38.250
 and yes first generally agree the map 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.570
 is also for advanced topic 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.030
 very useful 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.430
 because many people believe they believe so 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.920
 that you need to buy a pc you 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.559
 a titan for several thousand euros 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.989
 buy or what do I know but that 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.600
 you really do not need 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:57.690
 This card is in fact affordable 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.660
 Price segment of only about 220 euros the 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.760
 Price is from factory as I said this 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.519
 card is from one of the cards of 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.840
 the ones are usually cheaper and 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.970
 but you can on this card 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.900
 actually all games in very good 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.140
 attitude to the game 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:17.040
 For technical details see this map 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:21.120
 a david owns the xtm chip and 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.770
 clocked with 1020 megahertz she has one 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.540
 power of 2000 48 shader units and 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.790
 if he uses this card he needs 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.370
 but a stronger power supply because of this 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:37.920
 card in time about 250 watts in the highest 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.770
 power consumption she has three fans 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.780
 that is has advantages and disadvantages firstly 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:49.290
 three times the fans are more often 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.570
 turning slower are quieter than two 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.540
 revolves quickly but that has 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.909
 the disadvantage that the can that the 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.790
 This will make the card quite long 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.130
 means 30.8 cm and not in each 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.490
 helped so much space that means you 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.960
 also must have bayer housing was 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:14.820
 pretty careful that this card is pure 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:16.380
 Go to the benchmarks who are under 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.590
 the technical details are not much 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.200
 we could talk yes pay 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.680
 in the real fields of application as 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.480
 first time end 3d 3d mark a benchmark 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.950
 software 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.570
 this graphics card 11,450 points and 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.120
 but more interesting are the 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.650
 average games apps since the 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.459
 people are such a graphics card 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.290
 to buy 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.540
 probably play with it 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.700
 want minecraft in the very best 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.370
 so opti attitudes with opti 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:52.110
 Exposure extreme and everything on the 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:57.630
 best you get 200 30 fps in the 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:03:01.160
 bronx was all the best 120 fps black 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:06.100
 ops same setting again 190 ps and 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:09.580
 Battlefield 3 110 fps 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:14.770
 Those of these tests were with one 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:17.460
 intel xeon e3 12 31 v3 made and eight 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.460
 gigabytes of ram 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:26.810
 own experience here as on the left 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.760
 picture c, the graphics card is quite long 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.770
 as they almost fill the entire space in 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.850
 a housing and I have no 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.240
 small housing 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.220
 I still have it very deep 13 so 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.370
 that's a pretty big one with midi 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.080
 tower housing and it would be too 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.030
 can see clearly on the left and 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.030
 right picture is that if one is not 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.370
 modular power supply then has one 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.770
 quite a lot of stauder arises and 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.310
 Almost a bit of graphics card 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:57.590
 touches but that's okay if you have the 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.020
 if you are a bit too early 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.950
 that you also pull on the right leg 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.060
 that she is rather thin she is not 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:09.100
 not so fat either 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:14.300
 in my opinion has normal thickness 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:16.549
 and above the aluminum plate or these 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.620
 Metal plate is very good actually 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.120
 comes before me processed and she does 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.760
 generally process a customer 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.630
 could be an impression on me and one 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:29.900
 high quality impression 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:34.970
 wherein in said product was also a 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:36.860
 short instruction while one 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.140
 crossfire bridge and the one on the 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.980
 right picture sees this needed 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:46.730
 graphics card two 8 pin current current pole 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:49.010
 and who does not have that is also a 1 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.100
 an adapter where you have two molex 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.750
 cable to an 8 pin connector 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.960
 but it can be converted 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:02.000
 then stop even one second because 18 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:06.910
 only one yes the 0 1 put an adapter 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.740
 for a conversion of two months 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:13.070
 I say again thank you for 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.530
 see rating not forget 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.389
 easier an abo I am happy if everything 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.120
 their 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:21.770
 and I can only say this 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.160
 Graphics card is really a great one 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.510
 graphics card for the money you get 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.490
 almost nothing better for this 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.650
 So price segment really not much 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.250
 and thank you and see you next time 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.250
 bye
