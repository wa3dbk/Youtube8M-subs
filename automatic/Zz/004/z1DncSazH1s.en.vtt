00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.380
 for a Sunday and a little bit to invite 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.000

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.930
 that I come I open sack the grid 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.790

 It's a sun, thank you very much 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.680
 and we're going to fill up half the water 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.680
 of the mold the water is boiling 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.170
 there we can see how the steamboat comes out and 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.960
 I'm going to bake an average temperature 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.960
 45 minutes 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.880
 remember that steam burns much more 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.100
 that the fire and many times here was 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.520
 I 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.200
 now if it goes 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.000
 and when the program ends we will have 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.490
 a delicious delicious bread cake 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.250
 reinvention of the water bath is attributed to 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.930
 the Egyptian alchemist Mary of 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.239
 Alexandria in the third century the 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.099
 first known alchemist this method 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.959
 It is used to confer temperature 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.810
 uniform to a liquid substance or soria 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.670
 to warm it slowly by submerging 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.890
 container that contains it in another greater 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.150
 with water or other liquid that is carried 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.150
 up to a boil 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.269
 let's start in room to be a little 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.370
 different completely different and it 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.850
 characterizes nothing else because it has been done 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:45.250
 the orejona in a processor 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.250
 I'm going to put toasted hazelnuts 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.090
 thank you heart could you point me a 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.890
 little spatula on how not clear that 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.890
 if I'm going to stick the garlic 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.720
 let's see let's add curry powder there 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:06.040

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.040
 I'm going to add dijon mustard 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.500
 I'm going to add curry powder 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.270
 lemon 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.290
 and enough olive oil 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.400
 of course salt 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.110
 the reasons 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.069
 and we are already 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.510
 completely different takes two 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.260
 characteristics that are important the 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:43.010
 lettuce and this olive oil garlic 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.010
 and the mustard 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.520
 look to stay a hazelnut ready 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.530
 ready 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.810
 now the only thing that is a little bit 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.560
 different is that it will get along 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.560
 capers 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.500
 but 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.580

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:19.690
 let's put this mixture already ready in the 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.690
 saucer container 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.070
 I like the next idea what we're going 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:30.130
 to do let's go with our 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.130

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.680
 in the form of a fan we are going to put it 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.900
 let's put capers 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.090
 I'm going to put nuggets 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:58.229
 and to accompany of course we 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.229

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.180
