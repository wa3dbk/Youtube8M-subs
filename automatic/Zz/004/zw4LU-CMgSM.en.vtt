that what I'm really identifying on

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.480 
that what I'm really identifying on
Waypoint<00:02:29.030> 31<00:02:29.720> is<00:02:29.959> that<00:02:30.260> that<00:02:30.650> high<00:02:30.920> spot<00:02:31.310> and

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
Waypoint 31 is that that high spot and

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.010 
Waypoint 31 is that that high spot and
that's<00:02:31.550> what<00:02:31.820> we're<00:02:32.030> really<00:02:32.209> targeting<00:02:32.810> right

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
that's what we're really targeting right

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.850 
that's what we're really targeting right
now<00:02:33.230> but<00:02:33.470> as<00:02:33.620> I<00:02:33.650> open<00:02:34.340> up<00:02:34.459> on<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:35.170> 987<00:02:36.170> you'll

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
now but as I open up on the 987 you'll

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.250 
now but as I open up on the 987 you'll
see<00:02:37.130> what<00:02:37.370> how<00:02:37.730> many<00:02:37.910> waypoints<00:02:38.600> we<00:02:38.750> have<00:02:38.990> in

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260

see what how many waypoints we have in
here<00:02:39.590> we<00:02:40.130> have<00:02:40.250> a<00:02:40.280> whole<00:02:40.580> bunch<00:02:40.880> of<00:02:41.090> them
