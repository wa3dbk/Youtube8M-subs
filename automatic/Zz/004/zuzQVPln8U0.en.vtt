00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.520
 I'm leaving 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.860
 a full day of my meals for me 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:40.040
 competition as you can see the first 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:42.790
 food is a cup of coffee 4 4 eggs 3 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.790
 clear of a yolk 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.190
 nothing with some beans 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.530
 put on in 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.570
 and nothing is five and a half between half 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.010
 hour we will be within half or 40 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.469
 minutes we will be going to the gym 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:02.170
 and well nothing today we are going to finish biceps 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:03.789
 and back and a little shoulders maybe 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.199
 well do not give us the next meal 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.199
 until then take care 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.810
 Hello everyone, it's already five o'clock 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.550
 and a half and we're in the next meal 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:07.159
 which consists of a green apple 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:09.110
 four egg whites with half yolk and 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.170
 good is a tortilla stuffed with 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:16.190
 broccoli vegetables and asparagus 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.230
 and basically I think that my penultimate 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.800
 possibly accompanying food with 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.989
 two amino acid capsules and for 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.940
 give them now this I think I'm going to 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.530
 throw 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.530
 a little ketchup 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.480
 is the best you found the moment 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.740
 if you can see 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:41.540
 only has 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:45.110
 for every 7 grams it only has 7 calories 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.750
 and 172 of fat 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.840
 I think it's pretty good just you 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.610
 I give about seven grams 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.410
 and well with that concludes this meal and 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.290
 I'll see you in the next meal that 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.959
 possibly it is the last 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.469
 hello everyone again good this one already 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:04.939
 it's 8 o'clock at night and with this 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:04.939
 conclude all my meals 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.100
 they are 150 grams of chicken 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.160
 and vegetables 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.470
 possibly you put a little bit of a little 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.290
 of rice a quarter cup of rice or 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.840
 half cup 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.269

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.079

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.640

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.290

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.460

 beans black beans in the morning 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.770

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.200
 people do not like them but if they are not 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:54.860
 quite start with the meetings with the 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.730
 rice well rich but good this all 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.790
 this was this 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:03.800
 a typical day for me you could say 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:07.400
 and nothing to show you what 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.900
 there is magic trick to eat is to learn 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.270
 to eat nothing if it were to take 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.770
 daily continents know how many 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.860
 proteins, carbohydrates and fats 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:18.049
 you need a day and with that you can go 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.110
