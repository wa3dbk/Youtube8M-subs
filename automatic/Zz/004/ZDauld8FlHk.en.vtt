00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.750
 stages track 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.440
 noka madam in front and multi playable 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:06.390
 lesser step for example his band of 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:09.320

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.620
 savate and a player there is the world 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.620
 mista floy 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.760
 even with the man greeted the people 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.480
 here 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.120
 so here is the level is so 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.769
 the interface for those who knew 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.090
 on the 2012 it changed flat mode 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.980
 the fouled the standings facing the 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.420
 ranking is the level you have 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.580
 may have seen his live stream or even 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.540
 elsewhere we talk a lot about it 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.860
 now everything is not happening again 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.959
 seeing more we see the level between 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:51.209
 parentheses so here we see here is there 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.670
 already levels 2 level 3 even for 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.930
 some who m'écoeure level 3 here 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:01.260
 that we sell the level of the players 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:02.579

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.910
 team wind I know you do not worry 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:07.230
 my team and that's where we have to 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:12.090
 place our runners in relation to 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.379
 races we necessarily have it on pile 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.079
 the number of runners it takes 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.979
 for runners who attack problem 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.470
 but after May except that there are many 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:22.229
 more runners we can create 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.380
 staffing effects according to seoul example 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:28.169
 save sprinters or not or you 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:34.190

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:05.930
 a frame not seen yet these are eight pavé 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.610
 26 aisles yeah same for now 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.419
 this is his debut again not that 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:14.089
 wanted 8 bronze no money no gold 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:16.129
 no legend then here is my 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:19.279
 collection knew to 0 yet necessarily 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:20.960
 I was eight cards my statistics I 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:25.129
 have had no no race have for 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:27.710
 moment ago 47 ranked voila voila 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:29.810
 otherwise the shop massa happens as 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.969
 that the shop one so be a colt we have 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.270
 paid not see science up 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:37.669
 science of gold coins and packs my 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.259
 family that did not change 1,300 for 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:43.520
 1000 bronze for silver and 5000 gold pro 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:45.889
 the calendar so that's a little bit all 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.210
 the day's races there I think they 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:48.080
 have not settled lounge think I 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.749
 think we can play all 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.620
 races all the races that we 

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:52.939
 want in quotation marks since it's 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.999
 random the races army know when 

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:58.069
 even the ranking here for now 

00:05:55.999 --> 00:06:02.509
 who m'écoeure are two points to 45 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:05.419
 the cciv understood his rating to rank at the 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:08.569
 collection level inject 25% so 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:10.879
 as much to tell you that science he goes 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:13.060
 up to 20 7% the first day it's 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:13.060
 impossible 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:28.879
 short, here is the bottom side is that so 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:28.879
 after we'll see what's going on 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.580
 this tower mode 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.770
 multiplayer that's what happens 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:46.910
 so in tower mode have there are rest of the 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:49.900
 world or not actually it's the same 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.900
 players I believe 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:59.120
 yeah but paul soppo green I know 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:03.770
 whether she does or and of the world anyway the 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:08.060
 then give the tour mode how are you 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:14.350
 to play here is so here is already here 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:16.580
 so finally create a party his players 

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:18.260
 so that confirms what we 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.740
 thought we can not play and that one 

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:25.700
 date with special base we have to play 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:29.300
 a key the db armada of the game what we can 

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:31.310
 not even throw start and we do not 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:35.710
 official it's really here we can 

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:40.790
 play only with the armada team what 

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:42.920
 so no disappointment anyway 

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:44.330
 Madame I like it's nice of with 

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.290
 a team to madam and disappointment when 

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.140
 even because we can not do this 

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.880
 that we want again here 

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:52.120
 here 

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.120
 listen otherwise 

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:58.160
 So here we are going to leave it is 

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.410
 red to show a little what is 

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.510
 really passed my team my package 

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:03.740
