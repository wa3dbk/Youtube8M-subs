00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.330 

this<00:00:00.780> might<00:00:00.989> be<00:00:01.170> a<00:00:01.199> good<00:00:01.380> tip<00:00:01.620> to<00:00:01.770> keep<00:00:01.920> in<00:00:02.129> mind

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
this might be a good tip to keep in mind

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.220 
this might be a good tip to keep in mind
even<00:00:02.700> though<00:00:02.790> this<00:00:02.939> template<00:00:03.540> is<00:00:03.720> supposed<00:00:04.110> to

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
even though this template is supposed to

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.499 
even though this template is supposed to
be<00:00:04.350> perfectly<00:00:04.830> round<00:00:04.950> it's<00:00:05.490> actually<00:00:05.910> not<00:00:06.150> and

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
be perfectly round it's actually not and

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.900 
be perfectly round it's actually not and
I<00:00:06.779> was<00:00:07.049> not<00:00:07.680> seeming<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.160> get<00:00:08.309> my<00:00:08.429> measurements

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
I was not seeming to get my measurements

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.640 
I was not seeming to get my measurements
to<00:00:09.000> come<00:00:09.179> right<00:00:09.389> out<00:00:09.630> right<00:00:09.929> over<00:00:10.200> here<00:00:10.410> so<00:00:10.590> I

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
to come right out right over here so I

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.860 
to come right out right over here so I
moved<00:00:10.889> it<00:00:11.010> over<00:00:11.099> here<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.550> I<00:00:11.610> I<00:00:11.880> started<00:00:12.570> going

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
moved it over here and I I started going

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.209 
moved it over here and I I started going
around<00:00:12.929> in<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.139> circle<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:13.590> realized<00:00:13.980> that

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
around in a circle and I realized that

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.510 
around in a circle and I realized that
some<00:00:14.549> some<00:00:15.389> ways<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.719> test<00:00:15.960> this<00:00:16.109> in<00:00:16.350> there<00:00:16.529> it

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
some some ways to test this in there it

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.849 
some some ways to test this in there it
just<00:00:17.550> isn't<00:00:18.210> exactly<00:00:18.840> round<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.529> what<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:19.680> did

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
just isn't exactly round so what I did

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.380 
just isn't exactly round so what I did
was<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.039> found<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.369> place<00:00:20.580> where<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.850> was<00:00:21.000> round

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
was I found the place where it was round

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.210 
was I found the place where it was round
I<00:00:21.600> put<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.960> little<00:00:22.109> mark<00:00:22.350> at<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.619> front<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.130> at

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
I put a little mark at the front and at

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.640 
I put a little mark at the front and at
the<00:00:23.250> back<00:00:23.660> so<00:00:24.660> when<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:24.810> put<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.199> over<00:00:25.320> here<00:00:25.619> I

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
the back so when I put it over here I

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.560 
the back so when I put it over here I
can<00:00:25.859> put<00:00:26.070> my<00:00:26.220> mark<00:00:26.519> at<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.910> front<00:00:27.180> on<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.359> back

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
can put my mark at the front on the back

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.939 
can put my mark at the front on the back
and<00:00:27.810> line<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.199> up<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.680> way<00:00:28.800> when<00:00:28.920> I

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
and line that up and that way when I

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.089 
and line that up and that way when I
measure<00:00:29.420> from<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.599> sides<00:00:30.929> I'll<00:00:31.560> get<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.920> right

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
measure from the sides I'll get it right

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.560 
measure from the sides I'll get it right
the<00:00:32.550> reason<00:00:32.820> that's<00:00:32.910> important<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.420> because

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
the reason that's important is because

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.290 
the reason that's important is because
if<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.870> have<00:00:33.899> one<00:00:34.320> sink<00:00:34.820> that<00:00:35.820> comes<00:00:36.090> out<00:00:36.270> to

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
if you have one sink that comes out to

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.540 
if you have one sink that comes out to
here<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.899> one<00:00:37.260> sink<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.680> comes<00:00:37.920> out<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.250> here

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
here and one sink that comes out to here

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.520 
here and one sink that comes out to here
and<00:00:39.420> then<00:00:39.629> that's<00:00:39.840> just<00:00:39.930> not<00:00:40.200> going<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.379> look

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
and then that's just not going to look

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.799 
and then that's just not going to look
good<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.160> know<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.340> minutes<00:00:41.760> might<00:00:42.600> not

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
good and you know it minutes might not

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.319 
good and you know it minutes might not
seem<00:00:43.020> like<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.200> big<00:00:43.320> thing<00:00:43.710> but<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.460> would<00:00:45.120> be

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
seem like a big thing but it would be

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.569 
seem like a big thing but it would be
you<00:00:45.809> know<00:00:45.840> if<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.379> got<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.219> thing<00:00:47.399> all<00:00:47.520> put

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
you know if you got this thing all put

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.160 
you know if you got this thing all put
together<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.300> spent<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.629> next<00:00:48.809> thirty

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
together and you spent the next thirty

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.200 
together and you spent the next thirty
years<00:00:49.289> looking<00:00:49.829> at<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.250> thinking<00:00:50.520> dang<00:00:50.910> I

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
years looking at it and thinking dang I

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.209 
years looking at it and thinking dang I
wish<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.510> got<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.989> right<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.379> first<00:00:52.620> time

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
wish I got that right the first time

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.840 
wish I got that right the first time
well<00:00:54.500> you'll<00:00:55.500> spend<00:00:55.770> 30<00:00:56.010> years<00:00:56.129> wishing<00:00:56.760> you

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
well you'll spend 30 years wishing you

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.580 
well you'll spend 30 years wishing you
got<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.180> right<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.480> first<00:00:57.690> time<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.350> don't

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
got it right the first time and I don't

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.520 
got it right the first time and I don't
want<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.920> do<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.430> want<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.760> actually<00:01:00.530> get

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
want to do that I want to actually get

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.789 
want to do that I want to actually get
it<00:01:01.710> right<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.070> first<00:01:02.100> time<00:01:02.640> which<00:01:03.000> means<00:01:03.799> in

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
it right the first time which means in

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.380 
it right the first time which means in
this<00:01:04.949> case<00:01:05.250> we're<00:01:05.549> going<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.760> measure<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.150> a

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
this case we're going to measure it a

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.410 
this case we're going to measure it a
lot<00:01:10.220> that<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.520> plan<00:01:11.760> let's<00:01:12.060> see<00:01:12.210> how<00:01:12.360> that

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
lot that is the plan let's see how that

00:01:12.420 --> 00:02:14.400 
lot that is the plan let's see how that
works<00:01:12.689> out

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.250 

okay<00:02:15.410> there<00:02:15.650> it<00:02:15.739> is<00:02:15.830> roughly<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:17.720> sinks<00:02:18.080> are

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
okay there it is roughly the sinks are

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.570 
okay there it is roughly the sinks are
sitting<00:02:18.680> in<00:02:18.830> place<00:02:19.099> I<00:02:19.430> got<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.450> do<00:02:20.569> now<00:02:20.750> is<00:02:21.049> uh

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
sitting in place I got to do now is uh

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.289 
sitting in place I got to do now is uh
plummet<00:02:22.580> and<00:02:24.069> inside<00:02:25.069> here<00:02:25.459> where<00:02:26.120> the

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
plummet and inside here where the

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.020 
plummet and inside here where the
drawers<00:02:26.599> go<00:02:26.930> I'll<00:02:27.230> need<00:02:27.530> to<00:02:27.709> I<00:02:28.040> need<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:28.849> make

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
drawers go I'll need to I need to make

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.750 
drawers go I'll need to I need to make
some<00:02:29.180> modifications<00:02:29.900> to<00:02:29.989> that<00:02:30.230> top<00:02:30.500> drawer<00:02:30.760> so

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
some modifications to that top drawer so

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.339 
some modifications to that top drawer so
that<00:02:31.910> it<00:02:32.000> will<00:02:32.470> not<00:02:34.030> come<00:02:35.030> into<00:02:35.720> contact<00:02:35.959> with

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
that it will not come into contact with

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.020 
that it will not come into contact with
the<00:02:36.650> undersides<00:02:37.130> of<00:02:37.310> my<00:02:37.459> sinks<00:02:38.140> but<00:02:40.030> basically

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
the undersides of my sinks but basically

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.900 
the undersides of my sinks but basically
that's<00:02:41.269> a<00:02:41.329> pretty<00:02:41.480> good<00:02:41.690> start<00:02:42.049> it's<00:02:42.200> uh<00:02:42.910> is

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
that's a pretty good start it's uh is

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.520 
that's a pretty good start it's uh is
not<00:02:44.180> even<00:02:44.450> 8<00:02:44.599> o'clock<00:02:44.840> in<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:45.049> morning<00:02:45.110> yet

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
not even 8 o'clock in the morning yet

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.869 
not even 8 o'clock in the morning yet
and<00:02:45.680> I<00:02:45.709> got<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.040> two<00:02:46.190> holes<00:02:46.459> cut<00:02:46.930> so<00:02:48.670> I'll<00:02:49.670> get

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
and I got the two holes cut so I'll get
