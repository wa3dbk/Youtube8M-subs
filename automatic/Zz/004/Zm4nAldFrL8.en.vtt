00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.450

 So this is a scene here 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.830
 there is not just a little bit of it 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.750
 japanese culture justina this 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.410
 pop culture this post culture because of that 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.440
 are 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.399
 many cost risks gold coup 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.399
 like all the coal 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.510
 if I am myself 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.350
 should be on 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.519
 So you still have many 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.960
 institutes such as the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.460

 I want to be able to continue my education 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.360
 Everybody wants to have information 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.770
 I should definitely times 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.770

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.540
 Always wanted to go through a crowd in 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.380
 a safe running through the area 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.780

 his group continues to be continued 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:58.029
 then ask two questions when 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:58.960
 appears the whole and against whom 

00:04:58.029 --> 00:05:00.759
 taken to battle 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.379
 while details about story and 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:04.210
 Characters still kept secret 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:06.129
 Be where the Japanese magazine weekly

 from the fifth of july , dragon ball will be 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:14.110
 Great finally in Japanese television 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.539
 broadcast and thus solves directly 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.710
 the remaster dragon ball scarce thus 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:19.539

 related to story and characters 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:12.370
