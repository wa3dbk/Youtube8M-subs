00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:02.629 

okay<00:00:01.140> I<00:00:01.170> got<00:00:01.439> my<00:00:01.560> guys<00:00:01.770> grinding<00:00:02.280> out<00:00:02.399> of<00:00:02.520> that

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
okay I got my guys grinding out of that

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.480 
okay I got my guys grinding out of that
guy's<00:00:02.879> tank<00:00:03.270> into<00:00:03.750> a<00:00:03.990> big<00:00:04.500> can<00:00:04.770> over<00:00:05.130> there<00:00:05.250> I

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
guy's tank into a big can over there I

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.610 
guy's tank into a big can over there I
figure<00:00:06.359> it's<00:00:06.480> better<00:00:06.660> to<00:00:06.839> take<00:00:07.259> that<00:00:07.470> out

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
figure it's better to take that out

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.400 
figure it's better to take that out
without<00:00:07.799> it<00:00:08.130> being<00:00:08.250> full<00:00:08.490> of<00:00:08.610> gas<00:00:08.790> because

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:09.410 
without it being full of gas because

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.570 
without it being full of gas because
otherwise<00:00:10.410> I<00:00:10.620> might<00:00:10.769> pop<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.010> line<00:00:11.280> off<00:00:11.490> the

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
otherwise I might pop a line off the

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.039 
otherwise I might pop a line off the
bottom<00:00:11.880> still<00:00:12.150> gas<00:00:12.389> all<00:00:12.630> over<00:00:12.840> everything

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
bottom still gas all over everything

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.049 
bottom still gas all over everything
except<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.530> garage<00:00:13.769> on<00:00:13.980> fire<00:00:14.219> we<00:00:14.519> all<00:00:14.670> go<00:00:14.880> up<00:00:14.940> in

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
except a garage on fire we all go up in

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.279 
except a garage on fire we all go up in
flames<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.690> that<00:00:15.780> wouldn't<00:00:16.049> make<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.170> very

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
flames and that wouldn't make a very

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.640 
flames and that wouldn't make a very
good<00:00:16.590> video<00:00:17.090> oh<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:18.990> good<00:00:19.199> remember<00:00:19.590> I

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
was talking about it's probably a good

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.429 
was talking about it's probably a good
idea<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.180> get<00:00:21.300> this<00:00:21.449> tank<00:00:21.720> out<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.080> here<00:00:22.320> too

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
idea to get this tank out of here too

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.500 
idea to get this tank out of here too
because<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.519> seemed<00:00:23.730> like<00:00:23.760> there's<00:00:24.119> someone

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
because it seemed like there's someone

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
gas running out of the line I'd say

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.959 
gas running out of the line I'd say
something<00:00:29.340> ain't<00:00:29.580> right<00:00:29.640> with<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.000> line<00:00:31.969> hey

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
line off of there and then we'll replace

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.889 
line off of there and then we'll replace

here and I'll take a good look this
front<00:00:59.280> end<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.489> might<00:00:59.609> just<00:00:59.850> decide<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.120> go

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
front end I might just decide to go

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.520 
front end I might just decide to go
ahead<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.570> swap<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.870> front<00:01:01.079> end<00:01:01.230> while<00:01:01.410> I'm

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
ahead and swap the front end while I'm

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.920 
ahead and swap the front end while I'm
up<00:01:01.680> here<00:01:01.820> there's<00:01:02.820> some<00:01:03.000> scary-looking<00:01:03.420> stuff

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
up here there's some scary-looking stuff

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.899 
up here there's some scary-looking stuff
I<00:01:04.140> see<00:01:04.379> under<00:01:04.710> here<00:01:04.979> there's<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.489> whole<00:01:05.670> lot<00:01:05.880> of

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
I see under here there's a whole lot of

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.170 
I see under here there's a whole lot of
bondo<00:01:06.479> slapped<00:01:06.869> in<00:01:07.080> right<00:01:07.350> there<00:01:07.619> which<00:01:08.610> makes

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
bondo slapped in right there which makes

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.609 
bondo slapped in right there which makes
me<00:01:09.330> think<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:09.659> probably<00:01:09.869> not<00:01:10.110> much<00:01:10.350> under

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
me think it's probably not much under

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.910 
me think it's probably not much under
but<00:01:11.040> rust<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:12.200> might<00:01:13.200> be<00:01:13.320> good<00:01:13.439> idea<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.740> peel

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
but rust so might be good idea to peel

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.090 
but rust so might be good idea to peel
that<00:01:14.100> out<00:01:14.240> and<00:01:15.240> dress<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.960> anyway<00:01:16.950> let<00:01:17.070> me

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
that out and dress that to anyway let me

cleaning again we're believing that my
problem<00:02:05.420> may<00:02:06.420> not<00:02:06.630> actually<00:02:06.840> be<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.110> master

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
problem may not actually be the master

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.309 
problem may not actually be the master
cylinder<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:08.009> may<00:02:08.190> be<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.599> reservoir<00:02:09.599> so

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
cylinder it may be this reservoir so

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.839 
cylinder it may be this reservoir so
when<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.470> went<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.739> pull<00:02:10.950> this<00:02:11.099> other<00:02:11.310> line<00:02:11.610> that

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
when I went to pull this other line that

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.180 
when I went to pull this other line that
I<00:02:11.910> had<00:02:12.180> connected<00:02:12.599> into<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.200> out<00:02:13.410> I<00:02:13.769> just

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
I had connected into it out I just

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.199 
I had connected into it out I just
slipped<00:02:14.430> out<00:02:14.580> like<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:14.940> wasn't<00:02:15.090> even

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
slipped out like it wasn't even

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.990 
slipped out like it wasn't even
connected<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.099> it<00:02:17.099> strained<00:02:17.549> all<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.940> way

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
connected and it strained all the way

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.339 
connected and it strained all the way
down<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.420> there<00:02:18.599> I'm<00:02:18.780> pretty<00:02:18.900> sure<00:02:19.170> that's

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
down to there I'm pretty sure that's

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.539 
down to there I'm pretty sure that's
probably<00:02:19.500> there<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.489> found<00:02:21.299> this<00:02:21.510> line<00:02:21.780> here

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
probably there I found this line here

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.589 
probably there I found this line here
the<00:02:23.549> thing<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:23.849> I<00:02:24.000> don't<00:02:24.150> know<00:02:24.269> if<00:02:24.420> this<00:02:24.569> is

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
the thing is I don't know if this is

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.420 
the thing is I don't know if this is
rated<00:02:25.410> for<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.680> brake<00:02:25.890> fluid

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
rated for a brake fluid

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.750 
rated for a brake fluid
you<00:02:26.610> know<00:02:27.769> I've<00:02:28.769> used<00:02:29.579> a<00:02:30.000> piece<00:02:30.420> of<00:02:31.760> air

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
you know I've used a piece of air

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.809 
you know I've used a piece of air
compressor<00:02:33.420> line<00:02:33.660> on<00:02:33.870> this<00:02:34.110> part<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.530> it

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
compressor line on this part and it

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.369 
compressor line on this part and it
hadn't<00:02:35.819> really<00:02:36.030> deteriorated<00:02:36.900> all<00:02:37.019> together

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
hadn't really deteriorated all together

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.819 
hadn't really deteriorated all together
but<00:02:37.620> I'm<00:02:37.950> not<00:02:38.160> sure<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.459> it's<00:02:38.760> not<00:02:38.910> dumping

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
but I'm not sure that it's not dumping

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.979 
but I'm not sure that it's not dumping
crap<00:02:40.829> into<00:02:41.250> my<00:02:41.549> cylinder<00:02:42.030> something<00:02:42.629> a<00:02:42.720> little

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
crap into my cylinder something a little

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.430 
crap into my cylinder something a little
nervous<00:02:43.470> about<00:02:43.590> using<00:02:44.129> it<00:02:45.019> I'm<00:02:46.019> tempted<00:02:46.319> to

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
nervous about using it I'm tempted to

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.880 
nervous about using it I'm tempted to
attach<00:02:47.129> this<00:02:47.400> line<00:02:47.610> real<00:02:47.910> good<00:02:48.680> and<00:02:49.680> then

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
attach this line real good and then

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.949 
attach this line real good and then
bleed<00:02:50.099> this<00:02:50.340> out<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:52.260> see<00:02:52.470> if<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.769> holds<00:02:53.959> and

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
bleed this out and see if that holds and

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.300 
bleed this out and see if that holds and
see<00:02:55.200> what<00:02:55.319> happens<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.709> suppose<00:02:55.920> another<00:02:56.040> thing

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
see what happens I suppose another thing

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.620 
see what happens I suppose another thing
I<00:02:56.370> can<00:02:56.519> do<00:02:56.609> is<00:02:56.730> take<00:02:56.910> a<00:02:56.940> piece<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.209> this<00:02:57.450> and

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
I can do is take a piece of this and

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.420 
I can do is take a piece of this and
drop<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:58.049> in<00:02:58.139> a<00:02:58.200> can<00:02:58.410> of<00:02:58.500> brake<00:02:58.650> fluid<00:02:58.709> just<00:02:59.250> see

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
drop it in a can of brake fluid just see

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.039 
drop it in a can of brake fluid just see
what<00:02:59.700> happens<00:03:00.090> whether<00:03:00.359> it<00:03:00.480> Terrier<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:00.989> sh<00:03:01.019> Y

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
what happens whether it Terrier a sh Y

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.150 
what happens whether it Terrier a sh Y
or<00:03:01.200> not<00:03:01.350> I've<00:03:01.530> done<00:03:01.709> that<00:03:01.859> kind<00:03:01.980> of<00:03:02.100> thing

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
or not I've done that kind of thing

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.780 
or not I've done that kind of thing
before<00:03:02.370> -<00:03:03.170> mm-hmm

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
before - mm-hmm

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.290 
before - mm-hmm
let's<00:03:06.420> see<00:03:06.569> what<00:03:06.720> happens

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
let's see what happens

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.330 
let's see what happens
