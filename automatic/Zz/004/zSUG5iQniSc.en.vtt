channel<00:00:29.760> he<00:00:30.599> recently<00:00:30.810> did<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.230> video<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.920> so

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:32.690 
channel he recently did a video of it so

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.150 
channel he recently did a video of it so
that's<00:00:33.690> where<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:33.989> saw<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.559> padlock<00:00:34.920> for<00:00:35.100> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
that's where I saw the padlock for the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.490 
that's where I saw the padlock for the
first<00:00:35.340> time<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.820> have<00:00:36.180> had<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.780> have<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.140> couple

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
first time and have had to have a couple

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.650 
first time and have had to have a couple
so<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.800> searched<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.340> internet<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.760> found<00:00:38.850> out

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
so I searched the internet and found out

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.619 
so I searched the internet and found out
where<00:00:40.050> they<00:00:40.260> were<00:00:40.379> selling<00:00:40.890> them<00:00:41.270> this<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.570> a

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
where they were selling them this is a

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.810 
where they were selling them this is a
10<00:00:42.989> button<00:00:43.520> padlock

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
10 button padlock

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.330 
10 button padlock
I<00:00:44.850> think<00:00:45.539> Bosnian<00:00:46.140> bill<00:00:46.289> had<00:00:46.559> eight<00:00:46.829> buttons

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
I think Bosnian bill had eight buttons

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.189 
I think Bosnian bill had eight buttons
but<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.629> technique<00:00:48.960> he<00:00:49.640> describes<00:00:50.960> works<00:00:51.960> as

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
but the technique he describes works as

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.389 
but the technique he describes works as
well<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.710> one<00:00:52.940> with<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.120> little<00:00:54.449> exception

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
well in this one with a little exception

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.189 
well in this one with a little exception
of<00:00:56.399> course<00:00:56.879> when<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.329> right<00:00:57.480> combination<00:00:58.050> is

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
of course when the right combination is

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.410 
of course when the right combination is
styled<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:59.309> can<00:00:59.489> use<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.850> lever<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
styled you can use the lever in the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.460 
styled you can use the lever in the
bottom<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:01.050> release<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.739> shackle<00:01:03.080> it<00:01:04.080> can<00:01:04.290> be

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
bottom to release the shackle it can be

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.120 
bottom to release the shackle it can be
locked<00:01:04.949> back<00:01:05.129> down<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:06.500> as<00:01:07.500> long<00:01:07.710> as<00:01:07.740> the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
locked back down and as long as the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.080 
locked back down and as long as the
buttons<00:01:08.520> are<00:01:08.850> pushed<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.750> can<00:01:09.960> reopen<00:01:11.090> and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
buttons are pushed you can reopen and

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.690 
buttons are pushed you can reopen and
when<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:13.049> reset<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.560> buttons<00:01:14.100> by<00:01:14.430> pushing

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
when you reset the buttons by pushing

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.890 
when you reset the buttons by pushing
them<00:01:14.970> on<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.570> back<00:01:15.720> side<00:01:17.330> when<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.450> now<00:01:18.600> try

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
them on the back side when you now try

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.460 
them on the back side when you now try
to<00:01:19.040> release<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.250> shackle<00:01:20.580> with<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.759> lever<00:01:21.470> pops

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
to release the shackle with a lever pops

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.820 
to release the shackle with a lever pops
out<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.979> little<00:01:23.189> bit<00:01:23.400> but<00:01:23.780> still<00:01:24.780> locked<00:01:25.080> and

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
out a little bit but still locked and

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.120 
out a little bit but still locked and
now<00:01:26.009> all<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.490> pressure<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.450> buttons

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
now all the pressure is on the buttons

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.910 
now all the pressure is on the buttons
the<00:01:29.130> technique<00:01:29.490> Bosnia<00:01:30.030> bill<00:01:30.180> described<00:01:30.720> is

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
the right ones will go all the way down

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.039 
the right ones will go all the way down
if<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:59.090> start

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
if I start

if I start
the<00:02:02.040> wrong<00:02:02.220> side<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.729> this<00:02:02.820> one<00:02:05.210> not<00:02:06.210> do<00:02:06.540> the

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
the wrong side of this one not do the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:13.580 
the wrong side of this one not do the
back<00:02:07.079> row<00:02:07.290> first<00:02:10.520> all<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:12.300> buttons<00:02:12.630> will

back row first all the buttons will

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.199 
back row first all the buttons will
easily<00:02:13.890> go<00:02:14.459> down<00:02:16.550> now<00:02:17.550> mine<00:02:17.790> in<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.180> little

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
easily go down now mine in a little

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.259 
easily go down now mine in a little
trouble<00:02:18.660> but<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.860> found<00:02:20.099> out<00:02:20.310> if<00:02:20.670> I<00:02:21.000> just

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
trouble but I found out if I just

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:28.160 
trouble but I found out if I just
continue<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:26.640> wrong<00:02:26.880> buttons<00:02:27.360> will<00:02:27.780> stay<00:02:28.019> up

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
continue the wrong buttons will stay up

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.850 
continue the wrong buttons will stay up
the<00:02:28.680> right<00:02:28.860> buttons<00:02:29.250> will<00:02:29.400> go<00:02:29.580> down<00:02:29.849> and<00:02:30.590> now<00:02:31.590> I

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
the right buttons will go down and now I

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.500 
the right buttons will go down and now I
felt<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.519> little<00:02:33.200> give<00:02:34.200> in<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.830> shackle<00:02:35.790> node

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
felt a little give in the shackle node

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.440 
felt a little give in the shackle node
out<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.810> little<00:02:37.140> bit<00:02:37.700> now<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.730> same<00:02:39.060> technique

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
out a little bit now the same technique

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.340 
out a little bit now the same technique
used<00:02:40.670> can<00:02:41.670> just<00:02:42.060> be<00:02:42.209> used<00:02:42.420> in<00:02:42.600> Reverse<00:02:42.959> to

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
used can just be used in Reverse to

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.729 
used can just be used in Reverse to
decode<00:02:43.799> the<00:02:44.400> last<00:02:44.640> row<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:45.330> buttons<00:02:45.739> by

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
decode the last row of buttons by

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.320 
decode the last row of buttons by
pushing<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.190> pins<00:02:47.400> back<00:02:48.319> the<00:02:49.790> right<00:02:50.790> buttons

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
pushing the pins back the right buttons

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.410 
pushing the pins back the right buttons
or<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.930> buttons<00:02:52.230> that<00:02:52.290> should<00:02:52.799> stay<00:02:53.100> down

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
or the buttons that should stay down

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.090 
or the buttons that should stay down
which<00:02:54.420> is<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.720> part<00:02:55.049> of<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.290> combination<00:02:55.890> will

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
which is a part of the combination will
