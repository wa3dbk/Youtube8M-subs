00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
top and a hook on the bottom so it's

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.139 
top and a hook on the bottom so it's
simple<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:03.960> just<00:02:03.990> hook<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.500> bungee<00:02:04.860> in<00:02:05.149> you

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
simple you just hook the bungee in you

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.190 
simple you just hook the bungee in you
wrap<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.450> around<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.930> couple<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.229> times

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.010 

and<00:02:10.610> then<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.910> secure<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.390> other<00:02:12.540> hook<00:02:12.780> and

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
and then you secure the other hook and

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.800 
and then you secure the other hook and
then<00:02:13.319> you're<00:02:13.680> pretty<00:02:13.890> much<00:02:14.010> done<00:02:14.450> it's<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.600> nice

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
then you're pretty much done it's a nice

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.570 
then you're pretty much done it's a nice
simple<00:02:17.480> way<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.510> do<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:18.840> ponytail<00:02:19.260> once<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.340> found

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.010 
these they're expensive though but I
don't<00:02:22.770> care<00:02:22.980> it's<00:02:23.310> worth<00:02:23.459> it<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:24.510> then<00:02:24.750> what

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
I started right there all we'd have to

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.880 
I started right there all we'd have to
do<00:02:35.070> is<00:02:35.190> just<00:02:35.310> wrap<00:02:35.550> it<00:02:35.580> just<00:02:35.820> like<00:02:36.300> that

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
and then pin into it and you wouldn't

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.000 
and then pin into it and you wouldn't
even<00:02:45.690> have<00:02:45.959> that<00:02:46.170> but<00:02:46.410> it<00:02:46.500> would<00:02:46.590> still<00:02:46.709> look

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
even have that but it would still look

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.280 
even have that but it would still look
nice<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.580> full<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:47.850> round<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:49.080> then<00:02:49.170> we're

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
nice and full and round and then we're

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.400 
nice and full and round and then we're
gonna<00:02:49.380> do<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.590> last<00:02:49.830> one<00:02:50.900> so<00:02:51.900> what<00:02:52.050> I'm<00:02:52.200> gonna

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
gaps any large gaps that we might have

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.470 
gaps any large gaps that we might have
so<00:03:05.310> that<00:03:05.489> it<00:03:05.580> looks<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.820> lot<00:03:06.120> more<00:03:06.300> uniform<00:03:08.480> and
