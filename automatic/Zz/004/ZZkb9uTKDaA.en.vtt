cut it out and we're going to put some
fabric<00:01:06.630> on<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.200> now<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.439> could<00:01:07.710> use<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.040> like

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
fabric on it now you could use it like

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.219 
fabric on it now you could use it like
this<00:01:08.310> if<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.579> wanted<00:01:08.869> where's<00:01:09.869> just<00:01:10.110> the

this if you wanted where's just the

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.600 
this if you wanted where's just the
clear<00:01:10.500> but<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.829> thought<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.189> would<00:01:11.280> be<00:01:11.399> kind<00:01:11.579> of

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
clear but I thought it would be kind of

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.310 
clear but I thought it would be kind of
cool<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.850> have<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> fabric<00:01:12.570> just<00:01:12.720> in<00:01:12.899> case<00:01:13.079> my

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
cool to have a fabric just in case my

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:21.920 
cool to have a fabric just in case my
flowers<00:01:13.710> didn't<00:01:14.579> completely<00:01:15.090> cover<00:01:20.810> next<00:01:21.810> I

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
flowers didn't completely cover next I

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.790 
flowers didn't completely cover next I
put<00:01:22.110> some<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.790> palest<00:01:23.790> exceed<00:01:24.590> tape<00:01:25.590> on

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
put some of the palest exceed tape on

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.240 
put some of the palest exceed tape on
here<00:01:26.190> and<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.970> have<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.210> same<00:01:27.510> size<00:01:27.780> circle<00:01:28.260> so

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
here and I have a same size circle so

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:45.830 
here and I have a same size circle so
I'm<00:01:29.310> going<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.520> cut<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.820> out

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.570 

and<00:01:45.990> remember<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.010> the<00:01:47.159> peel-and-stick

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
and remember that the peel-and-stick

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.490 
and remember that the peel-and-stick
sheets<00:01:48.000> are<00:01:48.240> washable<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.200> could

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
sheets are washable so you could

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.060 
sheets are washable so you could
actually<00:01:49.830> wash<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.490> belt<00:01:51.619> okay<00:01:52.619> when<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.920> go

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
actually wash this belt okay when you go

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.130 
actually wash this belt okay when you go
to<00:01:53.130> take<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.549> off<00:01:53.670> if<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.880> take<00:01:54.240> your<00:01:54.780> fingers

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
to take it off if you take your fingers

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.039 
to take it off if you take your fingers
and<00:01:55.170> just<00:01:55.380> really<00:01:55.890> push<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:57.299> can

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
and just really push it and you can

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.460 
and just really push it and you can
separate<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.650> like<00:01:59.270> so<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:03.229> when<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.259> have<00:02:04.440> a

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
separate it like so and when you have a

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.350 
separate it like so and when you have a
big<00:02:04.710> piece<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.159> always<00:02:05.369> find<00:02:05.610> it's<00:02:05.820> easier<00:02:06.210> if

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
big piece I always find it's easier if

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:14.059 
big piece I always find it's easier if
you<00:02:06.450> put<00:02:06.659> half<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.080> on<00:02:07.140> first<00:02:11.270> and<00:02:13.069> then

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
you put half of it on first and then

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:20.050 
you put half of it on first and then
pull<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.459> off<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:17.130> get<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.580> other<00:02:17.730> half<00:02:17.970> long

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
pull it off and get the other half long

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.009 
pull it off and get the other half long

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.690 
the water bottle was going to hold it
through<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.620> lot<00:02:49.890> of<00:02:50.070> Waring's

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
through a lot of Waring's

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.789 
through a lot of Waring's
so<00:02:50.880> what<00:02:51.209> I<00:02:51.239> came<00:02:51.329> up<00:02:51.510> with<00:02:51.660> was<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.650> take

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
so what I came up with was to take

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.630 
so what I came up with was to take
another<00:02:53.100> strip<00:02:54.140> paper<00:02:55.140> punch<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:56.010> I'm

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
another strip paper punch it and I'm

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.460 
another strip paper punch it and I'm
going<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.850> put<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.060> together<00:02:57.180> with<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:58.970> eyelet

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
going to put it together with a eyelet

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.220 
going to put it together with a eyelet
so<00:03:01.470> since<00:03:02.160> we<00:03:02.250> have<00:03:02.400> our<00:03:02.430> front<00:03:02.760> covered<00:03:03.239> we're

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
so since we have our front covered we're

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.699 
so since we have our front covered we're
going<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.440> put<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.950> eyelet<00:03:05.370> through<00:03:06.380> like<00:03:07.380> so

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
going to put the eyelet through like so

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.350 
going to put the eyelet through like so
so<00:03:08.250> it's<00:03:08.280> going<00:03:08.579> through<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:08.940> front<00:03:09.120> of<00:03:09.239> the

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
so it's going through the front of the

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.180 
so it's going through the front of the
buckle<00:03:09.660> of<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.870> round<00:03:10.079> part<00:03:10.350> and<00:03:10.590> then<00:03:11.040> this

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
buckle of the round part and then this

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.970

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
basic part of the the buckle that we're

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.790 
basic part of the the buckle that we're
going<00:04:08.330> to<00:04:08.390> actually<00:04:08.780> put<00:04:08.959> the<00:04:09.080> flowers<00:04:09.440> on<00:04:09.590> now

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
going to actually put the flowers on now

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.820 
going to actually put the flowers on now
I<00:04:09.830> cut<00:04:10.099> these<00:04:10.250> flowers<00:04:10.760> out<00:04:10.970> of<00:04:11.300> um<00:04:13.450> the<00:04:14.830> Sizzix

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
I cut these flowers out of um the Sizzix

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.409 
I cut these flowers out of um the Sizzix
so<00:04:16.459> they're<00:04:16.700> just<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:19.280> die<00:04:19.459> cut<00:04:19.729> ones<00:04:20.120> so<00:04:20.389> you

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
so they're just the die cut ones so you

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.629 
so they're just the die cut ones so you
just<00:04:20.630> start<00:04:21.049> gluing<00:04:21.200> them<00:04:21.470> on<00:04:21.620> and<00:04:22.100> you<00:04:22.460> want

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
just start gluing them on and you want

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.159 
just start gluing them on and you want
to<00:04:22.700> get<00:04:22.760> as<00:04:22.880> many<00:04:23.030> as<00:04:23.240> you<00:04:23.360> can<00:04:23.510> on<00:04:23.720> it<00:04:23.870> I<00:04:23.990> think

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
to get as many as you can on it I think

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.200 
to get as many as you can on it I think
it<00:04:24.260> looks<00:04:24.380> better<00:04:24.560> if<00:04:24.740> you<00:04:24.830> get<00:04:24.950> more<00:04:25.190> on<00:04:25.370> and

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
it looks better if you get more on and

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.930 
it looks better if you get more on and
then<00:04:26.660> just<00:04:27.020> kind<00:04:27.200> of<00:04:27.229> bunch<00:04:27.440> them<00:04:27.620> up<00:04:27.740> bloom<00:04:28.729> on

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
then just kind of bunch them up bloom on

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.670 
then just kind of bunch them up bloom on
bunch<00:04:29.660> of<00:04:29.810> them<00:04:29.900> up<00:04:29.960> bloom<00:04:30.290> on

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
bunch of them up bloom on

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.650 
bunch of them up bloom on
I<00:04:33.040> think<00:04:34.040> the<00:04:34.160> more<00:04:34.370> you<00:04:34.400> can<00:04:34.610> get<00:04:34.729> on<00:04:34.910> the

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
I think the more you can get on the

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.050 
I think the more you can get on the
cooler<00:04:35.930> it<00:04:36.139> looks<00:04:38.440> and<00:04:39.610> remember<00:04:40.610> to<00:04:40.790> you<00:04:40.910> can

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
cooler it looks and remember to you can

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.490 
cooler it looks and remember to you can
do<00:04:41.180> this<00:04:41.300> in<00:04:41.419> any<00:04:41.630> color<00:04:41.930> any<00:04:42.139> kind<00:04:42.380> of<00:04:42.440> the

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
do this in any color any kind of the

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.469 
do this in any color any kind of the
t-shirts<00:04:42.919> come<00:04:43.160> in<00:04:43.280> you<00:04:43.370> can<00:04:43.520> upcycle<00:04:46.330> see<00:04:47.330> how

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
t-shirts come in you can upcycle see how

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.600 
t-shirts come in you can upcycle see how
it<00:04:47.630> the<00:04:47.750> more<00:04:47.930> you<00:04:48.020> get<00:04:48.169> in<00:04:48.320> then<00:04:48.500> it<00:04:48.620> starts<00:04:49.340> to

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.310 

fluff<00:04:52.610> them<00:04:52.789> up<00:04:52.880> a<00:04:53.000> little<00:04:53.120> bit<00:04:53.289> okay<00:04:54.289> now<00:04:56.320> to

whites a little bit bigger and then the

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.340 
whites a little bit bigger and then the
black<00:05:22.610> I<00:05:22.789> used<00:05:22.970> a<00:05:23.060> little<00:05:23.180> bit<00:05:23.330> smaller<00:05:23.660> so<00:05:23.900> the

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
black I used a little bit smaller so the

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:25.810 
black I used a little bit smaller so the
way<00:05:24.530> that<00:05:24.560> you<00:05:24.800> cut<00:05:25.010> them<00:05:25.130> the<00:05:25.220> size<00:05:25.430> you<00:05:25.639> cut

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
way that you cut them the size you cut

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.340 
way that you cut them the size you cut
them<00:05:25.910> determines<00:05:26.419> on<00:05:26.539> the<00:05:26.630> size<00:05:26.870> of<00:05:27.020> your<00:05:27.050> belt

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
them determines on the size of your belt

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.580 
them determines on the size of your belt
but<00:05:28.190> what<00:05:28.310> you<00:05:28.430> do<00:05:28.930> when<00:05:29.930> you<00:05:30.080> cut<00:05:30.260> him<00:05:30.380> is<00:05:30.470> you

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
but what you do when you cut him is you

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:37.540 
but what you do when you cut him is you
just<00:05:30.770> stretch<00:05:31.550> it<00:05:31.669> out

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.760 

and<00:05:38.550> you're<00:05:38.820> going<00:05:38.940> to<00:05:38.970> need<00:05:39.180> four<00:05:39.479> of<00:05:39.509> these

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
and you're going to need four of these

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.850 
and you're going to need four of these
now<00:05:40.770> I<00:05:41.100> did<00:05:41.729> a<00:05:41.970> braid<00:05:42.479> that<00:05:42.690> was<00:05:42.900> four<00:05:43.470> strand

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
now I did a braid that was four strand

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.770 
now I did a braid that was four strand
braid<00:05:43.949> and<00:05:44.370> I<00:05:44.880> found<00:05:45.240> the<00:05:45.539> I<00:05:47.660> found<00:05:48.660> the

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
braid and I found the I found the

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.620 
braid and I found the I found the
instructions<00:05:49.080> online<00:05:49.530> so<00:05:50.100> just<00:05:50.340> put<00:05:50.729> in<00:05:50.910> like

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
instructions online so just put in like

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
strand braid and that's how I did this

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.870 
strand braid and that's how I did this
and<00:05:57.509> I<00:05:57.780> really<00:05:58.080> found<00:05:58.259> that<00:05:58.440> I<00:05:58.830> only<00:05:59.370> needed<00:05:59.669> to

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
and I really found that I only needed to

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.370 
and I really found that I only needed to
look<00:06:00.030> at<00:06:00.150> a<00:06:00.210> couple<00:06:00.539> steps<00:06:00.720> I<00:06:00.930> must<00:06:01.139> have<00:06:01.259> done

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
look at a couple steps I must have done

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.070 
look at a couple steps I must have done
this<00:06:01.530> like<00:06:01.800> years<00:06:02.550> ago<00:06:02.669> as<00:06:03.000> a<00:06:03.030> kid<00:06:03.360> because

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
this like years ago as a kid because

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.080 
this like years ago as a kid because
once<00:06:04.289> I<00:06:04.440> just<00:06:04.680> saw<00:06:04.860> the<00:06:04.919> four<00:06:05.220> first<00:06:05.520> steps<00:06:05.850> I

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
once I just saw the four first steps I

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.850 
once I just saw the four first steps I
was<00:06:06.720> able<00:06:06.900> to<00:06:07.050> just<00:06:07.320> keep<00:06:07.590> on<00:06:08.180> braiding<00:06:09.180> it<00:06:09.860> so

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
was able to just keep on braiding it so

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:16.010 
was able to just keep on braiding it so
I<00:06:10.919> just<00:06:11.010> glued<00:06:11.340> the<00:06:11.490> ends<00:06:11.789> together<00:06:14.570> and<00:06:15.570> then

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
I just glued the ends together and then

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.560 
I just glued the ends together and then
that<00:06:16.320> little<00:06:16.560> thing<00:06:16.680> that<00:06:16.800> we<00:06:16.889> just<00:06:17.100> made<00:06:17.570> this

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
that little thing that we just made this

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.640 
that little thing that we just made this
is<00:06:18.750> going<00:06:18.900> to<00:06:18.960> go<00:06:19.080> underneath<00:06:19.500> it<00:06:19.880> and<00:06:21.650> then

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
is going to go underneath it and then

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.170 
is going to go underneath it and then
it's<00:06:22.830> going<00:06:22.949> to<00:06:23.010> go<00:06:23.190> back<00:06:23.490> over<00:06:23.520> and<00:06:24.120> glue<00:06:24.500> and

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
it's going to go back over and glue and

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:31.189 
it's going to go back over and glue and
then<00:06:27.180> this<00:06:28.169> when<00:06:28.740> you<00:06:28.860> glue<00:06:29.070> this<00:06:29.250> part<00:06:30.199> that's

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 
then this when you glue this part that's

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:34.820 
then this when you glue this part that's
going<00:06:31.410> to<00:06:31.470> go<00:06:31.680> underneath<00:06:32.580> and<00:06:33.590> that's<00:06:34.590> going

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
going to go underneath and that's going

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.140 
going to go underneath and that's going
to<00:06:34.889> be<00:06:35.039> what's<00:06:35.370> going<00:06:35.460> to<00:06:35.580> hold<00:06:35.759> your<00:06:36.060> belt<00:06:38.150> as

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 
to be what's going to hold your belt as

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.200 
to be what's going to hold your belt as
the<00:06:40.139> strap<00:06:40.590> down<00:06:40.830> so<00:06:41.099> let's<00:06:41.310> take<00:06:41.460> a<00:06:41.490> look<00:06:41.729> at

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210 
the strap down so let's take a look at

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.409 
the strap down so let's take a look at
the<00:06:43.130> belt<00:06:44.130> that<00:06:44.340> we<00:06:44.430> made<00:06:44.610> here's<00:06:44.880> your<00:06:45.060> strap

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.419 
the belt that we made here's your strap

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:47.450 
the belt that we made here's your strap
going<00:06:45.660> down<00:06:45.900> and<00:06:46.199> so<00:06:46.770> this<00:06:46.919> is<00:06:47.070> where<00:06:47.250> it<00:06:47.310> makes

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 
going down and so this is where it makes

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.820 
going down and so this is where it makes
it<00:06:47.610> adjustable<00:06:48.229> this<00:06:49.229> is<00:06:49.410> where<00:06:49.590> all<00:06:49.620> the

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830
