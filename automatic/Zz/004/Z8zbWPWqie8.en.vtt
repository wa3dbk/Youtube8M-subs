00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
I'm going to add in another color later

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.510 
I'm going to add in another color later
to<00:01:40.090> make<00:01:40.239> it<00:01:40.390> look<00:01:40.659> darker<00:01:41.229> so<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:45.340> way<00:01:45.489> that

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
to make it look darker so the way that

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.330 
to make it look darker so the way that
they<00:01:45.880> do<00:01:46.709> the<00:01:47.709> highlights<00:01:48.069> and<00:01:48.250> the<00:01:48.310> shadows

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
they do the highlights and the shadows

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.869 
they do the highlights and the shadows
of<00:01:48.729> Detective<00:01:49.329> Conan<00:01:49.479> is<00:01:49.810> a<00:01:49.840> little<00:01:50.140> weird

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:50.879 
of Detective Conan is a little weird

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:53.429 
of Detective Conan is a little weird
where<00:01:51.879> they<00:01:52.119> make<00:01:52.420> usually<00:01:52.899> everything<00:01:53.200> dark

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
where they make usually everything dark

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.800 
where they make usually everything dark
and<00:01:53.590> highlights<00:01:54.069> or<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:55.149> color<00:01:55.390> of<00:01:55.509> the<00:01:55.659> hair

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
and highlights or the color of the hair

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.510 
and highlights or the color of the hair
but<00:01:56.649> sometimes<00:01:57.369> like<00:01:57.909> I<00:01:58.179> think<00:01:58.599> Moore's<00:01:58.869> case

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
but sometimes like I think Moore's case

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.949 
but sometimes like I think Moore's case
it's<00:02:00.520> just<00:02:00.700> black<00:02:00.939> and<00:02:01.299> other<00:02:01.509> times<00:02:01.780> it's

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:01.959 
it's just black and other times it's

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:05.419 
it's just black and other times it's
just<00:02:02.079> a<00:02:02.439> completely<00:02:03.069> bleach<00:02:03.429> color<00:02:03.759> like<00:02:04.689> um

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
just a completely bleach color like um

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.610 
just a completely bleach color like um
anita's<00:02:06.429> or<00:02:06.579> whatever<00:02:07.349> but<00:02:08.349> other<00:02:09.340> times<00:02:09.640> it's

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:10.620 
anita's or whatever but other times it's

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.280 
anita's or whatever but other times it's
where<00:02:11.620> it<00:02:11.769> looks<00:02:11.980> black<00:02:12.310> but<00:02:12.790> it's<00:02:13.389> not<00:02:13.750> and

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
where it looks black but it's not and

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.140 
where it looks black but it's not and
that's<00:02:14.440> a<00:02:14.530> different<00:02:14.889> color<00:02:15.160> I'm<00:02:15.819> just<00:02:15.970> going

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
that's a different color I'm just going

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.960 
that's a different color I'm just going
to<00:02:16.209> guesstimate<00:02:16.720> that<00:02:16.750> it's<00:02:17.019> brown<00:02:17.970> because

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
to guesstimate that it's brown because

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.530 
to guesstimate that it's brown because
of<00:02:19.180> Jimmy's<00:02:19.510> hi<00:02:19.840> highlights<00:02:21.180> because<00:02:22.180> if<00:02:22.420> it

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
of Jimmy's hi highlights because if it

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.270 
of Jimmy's hi highlights because if it
was<00:02:22.630> black<00:02:22.870> it<00:02:23.500> would<00:02:23.680> be<00:02:23.769> like<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:23.980> bluish

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
was black it would be like a bluish

blue for the shooting that might sound

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:37.750 
blue for the shooting that might sound
awkward<00:04:31.100> but<00:04:32.140> it<00:04:33.140> it<00:04:33.710> actually<00:04:33.920> works<00:04:36.460> if<00:04:37.460> dumb

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
awkward but it it actually works if dumb

awkward but it it actually works if dumb
right<00:04:38.090> which<00:04:38.660> I'm<00:04:38.840> probably<00:04:39.080> not<00:04:39.320> going<00:04:39.470> to<00:04:39.530> do

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710

one<00:04:52.930> does<00:04:53.930> online<00:04:54.260> like<00:04:54.590> one<00:04:54.910> way<00:04:55.910> of<00:04:56.030> doing<00:04:56.150> it

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:11.350 

don't

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.409 

maybe<00:05:12.020> I<00:05:12.139> should<00:05:12.169> just<00:05:12.349> left<00:05:12.710> it<00:05:12.830> as<00:05:12.949> a<00:05:13.419> regular

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
maybe I should just left it as a regular

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.290 
maybe I should just left it as a regular
pencil<00:05:15.020> drawing<00:05:15.409> because<00:05:15.650> I<00:05:16.120> that<00:05:17.120> look

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
pencil drawing because I that look

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.029 
pencil drawing because I that look
better<00:05:17.479> I<00:05:17.659> like<00:05:17.810> to<00:05:18.020> do<00:05:18.169> is<00:05:18.199> just<00:05:18.349> shaded<00:05:18.889> in

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
better I like to do is just shaded in

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:28.270 
better I like to do is just shaded in
boom<00:05:22.840> now<00:05:23.840> let<00:05:24.530> me<00:05:24.560> use<00:05:24.860> a<00:05:25.719> um<00:05:26.719> a<00:05:27.319> burnt<00:05:27.830> sienna

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
boom now let me use a um a burnt sienna

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:35.860 
boom now let me use a um a burnt sienna
here<00:05:29.319> and<00:05:30.319> try<00:05:30.919> and<00:05:34.060> blend<00:05:35.060> these<00:05:35.270> together<00:05:35.509> as

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
here and try and blend these together as

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:43.779 
here and try and blend these together as
much<00:05:36.199> as<00:05:36.259> I<00:05:36.530> can<00:05:42.189> it's<00:05:43.189> probably<00:05:43.490> not<00:05:43.639> the<00:05:43.759> best

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:43.789 
much as I can it's probably not the best

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:51.309 
much as I can it's probably not the best
way<00:05:44.240> of<00:05:44.270> doing<00:05:44.389> it<00:05:44.719> but<00:05:46.419> who<00:05:47.419> cares<00:05:50.020> because<00:05:51.020> I

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:51.319 
way of doing it but who cares because I

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:56.300 
way of doing it but who cares because I
don't

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:06.559 

so<00:05:58.610> I'm<00:05:59.610> gonna

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:06.569 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:11.990 

do<00:06:07.139> this

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.250 

this<00:06:12.630> is<00:06:12.810> just<00:06:13.050> the<00:06:13.170> wrong<00:06:13.380> way<00:06:13.620> to<00:06:13.680> do<00:06:13.890> it<00:06:14.070> but

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.260 
this is just the wrong way to do it but

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.600

holding the camera you probably saw her

00:07:14.989 --> 00:07:18.309

detail<00:07:16.449> again<00:07:17.449> with<00:07:17.689> cameras<00:07:18.139> probably

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 
detail again with cameras probably

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:27.339 
detail again with cameras probably
ruining<00:07:18.829> it<00:07:23.319> and<00:07:25.089> this<00:07:26.089> can<00:07:26.329> be<00:07:26.479> anything<00:07:27.019> it
