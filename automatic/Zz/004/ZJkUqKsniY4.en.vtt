hypertrophic<00:00:01.709> cardiomyopathy<00:00:02.000> is<00:00:03.000> a

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:03.170 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.050 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a
thickening<00:00:04.170> of<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.529> heart<00:00:05.009> muscle<00:00:05.220> that<00:00:06.000> is

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
thickening of the heart muscle that is

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:15.640 
thickening of the heart muscle that is
out<00:00:06.450> of<00:00:06.480> proportion<00:00:07.319> to<00:00:07.500> other<00:00:07.589> causes

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.650 

there's<00:00:16.650> several<00:00:16.980> things<00:00:17.460> that<00:00:17.670> typically

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
there's several things that typically

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.450 
there's several things that typically
cause<00:00:18.960> thickening<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.740> heart<00:00:19.830> muscle<00:00:20.400> and

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
cause thickening of the heart muscle and

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.099 
cause thickening of the heart muscle and
that<00:00:20.670> would<00:00:20.850> be<00:00:20.970> uncontrolled<00:00:21.810> high<00:00:22.080> blood

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
that would be uncontrolled high blood

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.460 
that would be uncontrolled high blood

reason it is a genetic disorder and and

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.229 
reason it is a genetic disorder and and
their<00:00:36.510> genetics<00:00:37.079> just<00:00:37.969> causes<00:00:38.969> their

myocardial<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.559> thicken<00:00:40.770> there<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.910> a

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
myocardial to thicken there is a

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.270 
myocardial to thicken there is a
procedure<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:43.140> has<00:00:43.469> been<00:00:43.649> around<00:00:43.860> since<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
procedure that has been around since the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.200 
procedure that has been around since the
60s<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> surgical<00:00:46.020> procedure<00:00:46.170> to

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
60s and that is a surgical procedure to

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.930 
60s and that is a surgical procedure to
take<00:00:48.210> out<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.719> piece<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.469> heart<00:00:49.829> muscle<00:00:50.010> in

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
take out a piece of that heart muscle in

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.700 
take out a piece of that heart muscle in
order<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.390> allow<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.719> heart<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.230> pump<00:00:52.410> better

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
order to allow the heart to pump better

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.060 
order to allow the heart to pump better
that<00:00:53.640> surgery<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.210> still<00:00:54.420> done<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.829> still

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
that surgery is still done and it still

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.490 
that surgery is still done and it still
works<00:00:56.340> very<00:00:56.610> well<00:00:56.969> however<00:00:57.390> it's<00:00:57.930> an<00:00:58.079> open

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
works very well however it's an open

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.639 
works very well however it's an open
heart<00:00:58.739> surgical<00:00:59.430> procedure<00:00:59.789> with<00:01:00.090> all<00:01:00.120> the

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
heart surgical procedure with all the

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.410 
heart surgical procedure with all the
potential<00:01:01.649> problems<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.520> brings<00:01:02.760> so

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
potential problems that that brings so

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.750 
potential problems that that brings so
there<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> new<00:01:03.899> procedure<00:01:04.189> called<00:01:05.189> alcohol

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
there is a new procedure called alcohol

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.810 
there is a new procedure called alcohol
septal<00:01:06.240> ablation<00:01:06.680> where<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:07.950> can<00:01:08.130> actually<00:01:08.369> go

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
septal ablation where we can actually go

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.789 
septal ablation where we can actually go
in<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.630> thickened<00:01:10.170> area<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.619> heart

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
in to that thickened area of the heart

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.609 
in to that thickened area of the heart
muscle<00:01:10.979> through<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> heart<00:01:12.240> catheterization

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
muscle through a heart catheterization

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.679 
muscle through a heart catheterization
procedure<00:01:13.729> we're<00:01:14.729> able<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.150> look<00:01:15.420> at<00:01:15.600> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
procedure we're able to look at the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.840 
procedure we're able to look at the
coronary<00:01:16.140> arteries<00:01:16.680> find<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.610> specific

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
coronary arteries find the specific

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.390 
coronary arteries find the specific
branch<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.049> artery<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.680> goes<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.250> that

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
branch of the artery that goes to that

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.149 
branch of the artery that goes to that
thickened<00:01:20.850> area<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.479> we're<00:01:22.170> able<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.680> inject

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
thickened area and we're able to inject

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.590 
thickened area and we're able to inject
pure<00:01:23.820> alcohol<00:01:24.330> into<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.920> cause<00:01:26.600> cell

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
pure alcohol into that to cause cell

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.380 
pure alcohol into that to cause cell
death<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.530> area<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.130> by<00:01:29.610> causing<00:01:30.270> that

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
death in that area and by causing that

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.660 
death in that area and by causing that
cell<00:01:30.720> death<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.290> essentially<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.070> small

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
cell death it's essentially a small

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.660 
cell death it's essentially a small
controlled<00:01:33.600> heart<00:01:33.960> attack<00:01:34.290> by<00:01:34.890> causing<00:01:35.490> that

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
controlled heart attack by causing that

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.840 
controlled heart attack by causing that
the<00:01:36.630> body<00:01:36.869> then<00:01:37.200> cleans<00:01:37.710> up<00:01:38.009> those<00:01:38.280> dead<00:01:38.549> cells

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
the body then cleans up those dead cells

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.929 
the body then cleans up those dead cells
and<00:01:39.530> shrinks<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.710> area<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.310> thickened<00:01:41.729> heart

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
and shrinks that area of thickened heart

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.240 
and shrinks that area of thickened heart
muscle<00:01:42.329> allowing<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.439> heart<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.799> pump<00:01:43.950> better

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
muscle allowing the heart to pump better

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.580 
muscle allowing the heart to pump better
getting<00:01:44.820> rid<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.299> obstruction<00:01:45.930> and

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
getting rid of that obstruction and

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.820 
getting rid of that obstruction and
allowing<00:01:47.009> patients<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.399> feel<00:01:47.610> better
