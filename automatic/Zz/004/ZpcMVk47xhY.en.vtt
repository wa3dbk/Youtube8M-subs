00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello hello with you again Nastya today 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.140
 I really want to talk about 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:19.470
 bimetallic radiators tian ran breeze 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:21.840
 500 when we want to choose a radiator that 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.000
 we do to start go online 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.150
 prescribe any brand 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.980
 read reviews and sit on the forums for that 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.460
 first of all we pay attention 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.300
 this is the strength of the radiator does not it flow and 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.210
 does not rust 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.520
 let's understand and so strength 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.410
 radiator section is made of 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.809
 vertical and horizontal 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.450
 reservoirs for passage of coolant and 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.789
 themselves collector from flooded aluminum 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.030
 an alloy of such an engineering solution 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.030
 Allows tian wound radiator to work with 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.800
 coolants of any quality also 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.460
 able to withstand increased 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.579
 pressure and water hammer 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.449
 the design completely excludes contact 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.140
 heat carrier with aluminum housing 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:12.270
 sections tightness it is due 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.369
 special design of the ends during assembly 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.860
 section as a gasket 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.659
 O-ring made of 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.150
 heat resistant chemical resistant 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.640
 rubber which unlike ordinary 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.770
 rubber will last you much longer 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.090
 This technology allows not only 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.670
 achieve excellent tightness 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:36.930
 longevity simplicity and convenience but also 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.900
 the customer will also be fulfilled 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.659
 painted radiator painted white 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.170
 special electrostatic color 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.970
 enamel using enamel powder enamel 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.130
 ral 9010 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.530
 after staining the radiator in 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.369
 electrostatic chamber rises 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.369
 level of scratch resistance and 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.369
 blows 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:05.020
 operating pressure up to 25 atmospheres 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.860
 maximum coolant temperature 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:13.220
 130 degrees heat output section 500 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:16.840
 millimeters 170 watts per 300 millimeters 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:20.330
 130 from us also you can purchase 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:25.490
 universal mounting kit which 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:29.630
 includes valves and plugs and a set 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:32.300
 for fasteners in the wall, I identified the most 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.850
 The main 5 advantages of a radiator are 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.100
 no pocket or slag collection 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.110
 what u prolongs its life 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:44.320
 for many years the lack of a weld 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.890
 firstly reliable secondly aesthetically pleasing 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.530
 preventive work you can 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.480
 carry out without dismantling also 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.209
 bottom connection 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.630
 I would like to say in conclusion everything 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:00.410
 tenrad radiators are hermetic and durable 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.930
 it's not just talking about the breeze model 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.739
 brand tian ran has 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:10.280
 many very many models of radiators 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:14.180
 you can pick them up as you need you 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.370

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.010
 and pick the right to call 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.320
