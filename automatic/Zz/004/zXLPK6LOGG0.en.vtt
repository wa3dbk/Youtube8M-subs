now this just got to go for it with a

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.859 
now this just got to go for it with a
left<00:01:50.250> wing<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.700> that's<00:01:51.090> how<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.329> potting

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
left wing and that's how the potting

works it gives you a circle and exactly

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.819 
works it gives you a circle and exactly
where<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.299> be<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.570> circle<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.020> then

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
where to be in the circle and then

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.230 
where to be in the circle and then
aligns<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.250> up<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.880> then
