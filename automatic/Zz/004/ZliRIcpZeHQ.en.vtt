00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:27.949
 the flowers, the dreams, the soul and the memory are a source of inspiration for 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.539
 these painters who keep the artistic tradition alive 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:37.190

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.130
 Arming Medina and Oscar Olao or those who show their works in the house of San 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.580
 frameworks in the framework of celebrations for the 458 years of the dean of 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.710
 america to graciela its source of inspiration is meditation and

 by this technique he met his angel 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.750
 this box 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.730
 it's called sad 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.730
 they present themselves and angel because I had a revelation 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.640
 percent the name of christ and there I met my angel and watching 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.370
 doing once inside they will offer a tree 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.840
 there is also revealed to me the image then I had to do 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.340
 but the theme of titles is to start with percent 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.770
 today in the middle of that nor with the form and facing the archer of the inter roma 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.100
 me since I was a child 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.850
 the work I love 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.120
 the aesthetic umbrella interpreter in those lands 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.250
 and now I try to look inside that shelby painting as remarked 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.160
 this Ecuador fact is called the mysteries of the chakana 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.080
 Caesar is that the Andeans have as insinuated esoteric loquilla 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.310
 the chakana that means heaven and hell and earth 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.940
 and the center 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.570
 gento means 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.230
 the father god the good harvest 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.470
 So they have a lot about this symbology and physics when the 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.270
 left 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.190
 It is lucky 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.150
 in the like to paint these 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.969

 the theme of 100 this urban infraction 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.849
 because because in urban architecture we find definite lines 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.409
 we find percent 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.819
 vaults that was forced to mark a circle straight line towards worlds 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.669
 the inefficient cross 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:30.599
 using the acrylic technique on canvases these remarkable artists 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:31.880
 cusqueños 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.820
