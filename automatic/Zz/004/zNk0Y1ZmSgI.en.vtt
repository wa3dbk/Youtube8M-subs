want to do something I've I don't know
I've<00:00:09.330> never<00:00:09.360> really<00:00:09.719> thought<00:00:09.870> of<00:00:09.929> did<00:00:10.230> trying

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
I've never really thought of did trying

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.120 
I've never really thought of did trying
I<00:00:11.519> know<00:00:12.150> that<00:00:12.450> it<00:00:12.599> used<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.259> have<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.679> chance<00:00:13.980> of

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
I know that it used to have a chance of

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.400 
I know that it used to have a chance of
killing<00:00:14.340> you<00:00:14.549> but<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:14.820> don't<00:00:14.910> know<00:00:15.120> how<00:00:15.410> strong

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
killing you but I don't know how strong

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.620 
killing you but I don't know how strong
that<00:00:16.470> chance<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.160> so<00:00:18.150> we're<00:00:18.240> going<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.420> be<00:00:18.510> F

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
that chance is so we're going to be F

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.519

you<00:00:22.529> know<00:00:22.560> HC<00:00:23.340> effort<00:00:23.580> over<00:00:23.850> at<00:00:23.939> least<00:00:24.090> this

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
you know HC effort over at least this

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.890 
you know HC effort over at least this
map<00:00:25.250> we're<00:00:26.250> going<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.400> try<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.000> we're

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
map we're going to try it and we're

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.589 
map we're going to try it and we're
going<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.109> see<00:00:28.289> if<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.680> kills<00:00:28.920> me<00:00:29.039> or<00:00:29.939> whatever

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
going to see if it kills me or whatever

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.380 
going to see if it kills me or whatever
I<00:00:30.810> shouldn't<00:00:31.260> go<00:00:31.380> rateable<00:00:31.830> because<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.669> even

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
I shouldn't go rateable because I even

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.979 
I shouldn't go rateable because I even
so<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.690> honestly<00:00:34.350> could<00:00:34.590> care<00:00:34.620> less<00:00:35.780> because<00:00:36.780> I

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
so I honestly could care less because I

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.430 
so I honestly could care less because I
have<00:00:37.110> one<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.559> should<00:00:37.800> get<00:00:38.780> 20.00<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.379> I

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
have one that should get 20.00 so I

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.790 
have one that should get 20.00 so I
shouldn't<00:00:41.090> be<00:00:42.090> readable<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.840> never<00:00:43.350> has<00:00:43.559> been

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
shouldn't be readable it never has been

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.130 
shouldn't be readable it never has been
so<00:00:44.190> unless<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:45.030> gives<00:00:45.420> me<00:00:45.600> more<00:00:45.750> or<00:00:45.840> something

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
so unless it gives me more or something

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.840 
so unless it gives me more or something
but<00:00:46.410> you're<00:00:46.890> sure<00:00:47.039> they<00:00:47.190> fix<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.670> map

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850
