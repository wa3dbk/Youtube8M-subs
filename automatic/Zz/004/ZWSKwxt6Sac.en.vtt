00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
indices and powers on scientific

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.999 
indices and powers on scientific
calculators<00:00:02.490> can<00:00:02.730> be<00:00:02.879> a<00:00:02.909> little<00:00:03.060> confusing

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:04.009 
calculators can be a little confusing

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.320 
calculators can be a little confusing
unfortunately<00:00:05.009> with<00:00:05.130> my<00:00:05.279> paper<00:00:05.819> versions

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
unfortunately with my paper versions

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.550 
unfortunately with my paper versions
we're<00:00:06.720> not<00:00:06.810> actually<00:00:06.990> going<00:00:07.200> to<00:00:07.290> get<00:00:07.379> any

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
we're not actually going to get any

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.690 
we're not actually going to get any
answers<00:00:07.859> so<00:00:08.160> I'm<00:00:08.250> going<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.460> do<00:00:08.580> this

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
answers so I'm going to do this

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.580 
answers so I'm going to do this
demonstration<00:00:09.179> on<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.660> piece<00:00:09.900> of<00:00:09.929> paper

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
demonstration on a piece of paper

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.259 
demonstration on a piece of paper
both<00:00:11.160> calculators<00:00:11.700> in<00:00:11.790> this<00:00:11.910> example

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
both calculators in this example

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.749 
both calculators in this example
operating<00:00:12.960> exactly<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.530> same<00:00:13.740> way<00:00:13.950> I'd<00:00:14.580> like

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
operating exactly the same way I'd like

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.050 
operating exactly the same way I'd like
is<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:14.940> consider<00:00:15.389> 4<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.560> power<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.949> 5<00:00:17.190> as<00:00:17.850> to

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
is to consider 4 to the power of 5 as to

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.490 
is to consider 4 to the power of 5 as to
say<00:00:18.240> 4<00:00:18.779> multiplied<00:00:19.230> by<00:00:19.380> itself<00:00:19.850> five<00:00:20.850> times

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
say 4 multiplied by itself five times

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.130 
say 4 multiplied by itself five times
now<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.529> could<00:00:22.920> simply<00:00:23.279> type<00:00:23.430> in<00:00:23.640> 4<00:00:24.119> times<00:00:24.750> 4

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
now I could simply type in 4 times 4

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.620 
now I could simply type in 4 times 4
times<00:00:25.650> 4<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:26.789> until<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.240> get<00:00:27.300> my<00:00:27.510> answer

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
times 4 and so on until I get my answer

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.689 
times 4 and so on until I get my answer
now<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.140> problem<00:00:28.529> with<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.220> could

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
now the problem with that is I could

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:30.980 
now the problem with that is I could
lose<00:00:29.910> count<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.300> how<00:00:30.449> many<00:00:30.510> times<00:00:30.779> I've<00:00:30.960> done

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
lose count of how many times I've done

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.440 
lose count of how many times I've done
that<00:00:31.289> certain<00:00:31.949> with<00:00:32.160> larger<00:00:32.489> indices<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.090> is

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
that certain with larger indices that is

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.229 
that certain with larger indices that is
a<00:00:33.480> real<00:00:33.809> possibility<00:00:34.430> so<00:00:35.430> with<00:00:36.180> the

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
a real possibility so with the

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.270 
a real possibility so with the
scientific<00:00:36.690> calculators<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.410> simply<00:00:37.890> type<00:00:38.040> in

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
scientific calculators I simply type in

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.990 
scientific calculators I simply type in
the<00:00:38.489> number<00:00:38.820> 4<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.860> then<00:00:40.860> need<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.040> find<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.730> Y

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
the number 4 I then need to find the Y

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.190 
the number 4 I then need to find the Y
to<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.360> X<00:00:42.390> book<00:00:44.270> the<00:00:45.270> 4<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:46.160> the<00:00:47.160> Y<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:48.200> then

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
to the X book the 4 is the Y I then

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.279 
to the X book the 4 is the Y I then
simply<00:00:49.530> type<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.010> 5<00:00:50.539> which<00:00:51.539> refers<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
simply type in the 5 which refers to the

calculators<00:01:08.549> actually<00:01:09.000> operate<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.420> a

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
calculators actually operate in a

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.880 
calculators actually operate in a
slightly<00:01:09.840> different<00:01:10.020> way<00:01:10.380> when<00:01:10.619> finding

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
slightly different way when finding

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.280 
slightly different way when finding
roots<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.520> numbers<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.630> I'm<00:01:12.720> hopefully<00:01:13.110> going

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
roots of numbers so I'm hopefully going

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.219 
roots of numbers so I'm hopefully going
to<00:01:13.350> demonstrate<00:01:13.560> both<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.280> them<00:01:14.869> I'd<00:01:15.869> like<00:01:16.020> to

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
to demonstrate both of them I'd like to

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.749 
to demonstrate both of them I'd like to
consider<00:01:16.619> an<00:01:17.549> example<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.360> fifth<00:01:18.659> root<00:01:18.930> of

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
consider an example of the fifth root of

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.580 
consider an example of the fifth root of
1024<00:01:20.759> what<00:01:21.509> number<00:01:21.810> we're<00:01:21.960> multiplied<00:01:22.409> by

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
1024 what number we're multiplied by

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.940 
1024 what number we're multiplied by
itself<00:01:22.979> five<00:01:23.780> times<00:01:24.780> will<00:01:25.500> give<00:01:25.680> us<00:01:25.830> a

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
itself five times will give us a

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.340 
itself five times will give us a
thousand<00:01:26.430> 24<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.270> calculator<00:01:27.840> on<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.110> Left

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
thousand 24 the calculator on the Left

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.219 
thousand 24 the calculator on the Left
I'd<00:01:28.950> start<00:01:29.369> by<00:01:29.430> typing<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.360> thousand<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.170> 24

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
I'd start by typing in a thousand and 24

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.859 
I'd start by typing in a thousand and 24
I'd<00:01:34.229> then<00:01:34.500> press<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.950> inverse<00:01:35.670> button<00:01:38.720> now<00:01:39.720> on

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
I'd then press the inverse button now on

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.170 
I'd then press the inverse button now on

first<00:02:05.219> thing<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.460> would<00:02:05.520> do<00:02:05.820> type<00:02:06.450> in<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.869> 5

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
first thing I would do type in the 5

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:08.999 
first thing I would do type in the 5
then

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
then

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.160 
then
the<00:02:09.399> second<00:02:10.060> function<00:02:10.390> button<00:02:13.049> which<00:02:14.049> in

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
the second function button which in

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.839 
the second function button which in
principle<00:02:14.290> is<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.739> same<00:02:14.769> as<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.129> inverse<00:02:15.310> on

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
principle is the same as the inverse on

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.330 
principle is the same as the inverse on
this<00:02:16.120> calculator<00:02:16.689> now<00:02:17.200> this<00:02:17.379> is<00:02:17.500> orange<00:02:17.950> in

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
this calculator now this is orange in

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.460 
this calculator now this is orange in
color<00:02:18.700> which<00:02:19.120> refers<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.659> orange<00:02:20.110> parts

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
color which refers to the orange parts

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.520 
color which refers to the orange parts
just<00:02:20.620> above<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.040> number<00:02:21.299> again<00:02:22.299> I<00:02:22.540> then<00:02:22.930> find

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
just above the number again I then find

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.100 
just above the number again I then find
the<00:02:23.829> Y<00:02:24.040> to<00:02:24.099> the<00:02:24.400> X<00:02:24.549> button<00:02:25.090> but<00:02:25.629> it's<00:02:25.750> referring

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
the Y to the X button but it's referring

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.080 
the Y to the X button but it's referring
to<00:02:26.409> the<00:02:26.560> bit<00:02:26.799> above<00:02:27.099> there<00:02:27.370> which<00:02:27.549> is<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.819> X

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
to the bit above there which is the X

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:35.849 
to the bit above there which is the X
root<00:02:28.870> I<00:02:29.319> then<00:02:30.310> type<00:02:30.610> in<00:02:30.819> my<00:02:31.000> 1<00:02:31.510> 0<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.799> 4<00:02:33.370> I<00:02:34.859> press

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:35.859 
root I then type in my 1 0 to 4 I press

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:38.699 
root I then type in my 1 0 to 4 I press
my<00:02:35.890> equals<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.670> I<00:02:36.849> get<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.120> same<00:02:37.359> answer<00:02:37.599> of<00:02:38.319> 4

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
my equals and I get the same answer of 4

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.640 
my equals and I get the same answer of 4
as<00:02:39.430> I<00:02:39.519> did<00:02:39.700> on<00:02:39.849> this<00:02:40.090> calculator<00:02:40.599> I<00:02:40.930> hope<00:02:41.470> that

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
as I did on this calculator I hope that

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.920 
as I did on this calculator I hope that
helps
