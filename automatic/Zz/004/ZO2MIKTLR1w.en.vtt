00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
like to kind of draw the line a little

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.420 
like to kind of draw the line a little
bit<00:03:10.980> is<00:03:11.459> when<00:03:12.240> it<00:03:12.330> comes<00:03:12.570> to<00:03:13.430> unprocessed

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
bit is when it comes to unprocessed

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.150 
bit is when it comes to unprocessed
foods<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:15.269> know<00:03:15.360> your<00:03:15.630> typical<00:03:15.989> cheap<00:03:16.890> foods

foods you know your typical cheap foods
or<00:03:17.310> junk<00:03:17.550> foods<00:03:17.790> I<00:03:17.970> mean<00:03:18.330> I'm<00:03:18.450> not<00:03:18.540> saying<00:03:18.780> that

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
or junk foods I mean I'm not saying that

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.410 
or junk foods I mean I'm not saying that
you<00:03:18.930> have<00:03:18.989> to<00:03:19.260> avoid<00:03:19.700> processed<00:03:20.700> foods<00:03:21.150> and

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
you have to avoid processed foods and

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.720 
you have to avoid processed foods and

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
junk foods entirely but I don't think

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.930 
junk foods entirely but I don't think
it's<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.120> fair<00:03:24.390> swap<00:03:24.810> nutritional<00:03:25.800> wise<00:03:25.980> to

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
it's a fair swap nutritional wise to

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.820 
it's a fair swap nutritional wise to
like<00:03:27.269> let's<00:03:27.480> say<00:03:27.600> you're<00:03:27.750> getting<00:03:28.110> 50<00:03:28.560> grams

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.400 
potato is totally different than the
nutrition<00:03:50.310> you<00:03:50.340> get<00:03:50.549> from<00:03:50.700> a<00:03:50.790> gummy<00:03:50.970> bear<00:03:51.410> and

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
nutrition you get from a gummy bear and

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.050 
nutrition you get from a gummy bear and
things<00:03:52.769> like<00:03:52.950> that<00:03:53.010> I<00:03:53.160> me<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.370> same<00:03:53.549> with<00:03:53.790> when

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
things like that I me the same with when

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.780 
things like that I me the same with when
it<00:03:54.150> comes<00:03:54.330> to<00:03:54.600> your<00:03:55.110> protein<00:03:55.799> sources<00:03:56.130> I<00:03:56.400> mean

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
it comes to your protein sources I mean

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.090 
it comes to your protein sources I mean
I<00:03:56.940> believe<00:03:57.000> in<00:03:57.660> consuming<00:03:58.080> solid<00:03:58.830> food

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
I believe in consuming solid food

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.120 
I believe in consuming solid food
protein<00:03:59.700> more<00:04:00.570> often<00:04:00.989> than<00:04:01.350> protein<00:04:01.830> shakes

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
protein more often than protein shakes

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.479 
protein more often than protein shakes
so<00:04:02.940> I<00:04:03.180> mean<00:04:03.330> if<00:04:03.450> if<00:04:04.049> you're<00:04:04.290> getting<00:04:04.650> again

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
so I mean if if you're getting again

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.320 
so I mean if if you're getting again
let's<00:04:05.940> just<00:04:06.030> say<00:04:06.209> 30<00:04:06.540> grams<00:04:06.870> of<00:04:07.110> protein<00:04:07.350> from

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
let's just say 30 grams of protein from

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.180 
let's just say 30 grams of protein from
chicken<00:04:09.330> breast<00:04:09.540> I<00:04:09.810> would<00:04:10.410> recommend<00:04:10.650> always

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
chicken breast I would recommend always

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.039 
chicken breast I would recommend always
swapping<00:04:11.730> out<00:04:11.790> 30<00:04:12.060> grams<00:04:12.299> of<00:04:12.450> protein<00:04:12.630> from<00:04:12.989> a

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
swapping out 30 grams of protein from a

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.810 
swapping out 30 grams of protein from a
protein<00:04:13.470> shake<00:04:13.709> I<00:04:14.040> mean<00:04:14.340> you<00:04:14.430> can<00:04:14.549> do<00:04:14.700> it

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
protein shake I mean you can do it

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.270 
protein shake I mean you can do it
occasionally<00:04:15.209> but<00:04:16.080> try<00:04:16.680> and<00:04:16.830> stick<00:04:17.130> with

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
occasionally but try and stick with

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.970 
occasionally but try and stick with
natural<00:04:18.000> wholesome<00:04:18.780> on<00:04:18.959> process<00:04:19.650> for

natural<00:04:35.700> food<00:04:35.910> is<00:04:36.180> the<00:04:36.330> way<00:04:36.450> to<00:04:36.510> go<00:04:36.750> but<00:04:37.470> you

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
natural food is the way to go but you

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.710 
natural food is the way to go but you
can<00:04:37.800> be<00:04:37.890> flexible<00:04:38.300> within<00:04:39.300> those<00:04:39.480> natural

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
can be flexible within those natural

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.740 
can be flexible within those natural
food<00:04:40.110> choices<00:04:40.440> so<00:04:41.310> that's<00:04:42.120> the<00:04:42.300> way<00:04:42.390> I<00:04:42.420> like<00:04:42.690> to

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
food choices so that's the way I like to

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.120 
food choices so that's the way I like to
design<00:04:42.990> a<00:04:43.140> diet<00:04:43.500> planet<00:04:43.770> that's<00:04:43.860> the<00:04:43.980> way<00:04:44.070> I

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
design a diet planet that's the way I

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.840 
design a diet planet that's the way I
try<00:04:44.400> to<00:04:44.430> eat<00:04:44.670> myself<00:04:44.910> and<00:04:46.310> there<00:04:47.310> that's<00:04:47.640> my

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
try to eat myself and there that's my

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.360 
try to eat myself and there that's my
opinion<00:04:48.300> I'm<00:04:48.600> flexible<00:04:49.200> dieting<00:04:49.530> so

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370
