00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.210 
a torch down and I think the most
plausible<00:02:30.510> explanation<00:02:31.510> now<00:02:32.110> on<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.739> table

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
plausible explanation now on the table

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.290 
plausible explanation now on the table
is<00:02:33.430> that<00:02:34.000> these<00:02:34.209> represent<00:02:35.019> day<00:02:35.760> night<00:02:37.410> growth

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
is that these represent day night growth

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.090 
is that these represent day night growth
decay<00:02:40.300> and<00:02:40.769> so<00:02:41.769> we<00:02:42.010> have<00:02:42.340> a<00:02:42.640> kind<00:02:43.300> of

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
decay and so we have a kind of

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.160 
decay and so we have a kind of
inauguration<00:02:45.100> in<00:02:45.580> a<00:02:45.670> way<00:02:45.880> to<00:02:46.570> the<00:02:46.690> cosmic

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
inauguration in a way to the cosmic

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.000 
inauguration in a way to the cosmic
progression<00:02:47.769> over<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.670> period<00:02:48.940> of<00:02:49.150> time<00:02:50.010> man's

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
progression over a period of time man's
