00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
build block ICS today we learn why they

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.980 
build block ICS today we learn why they
chose<00:00:23.460> ICF's<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.390> what<00:00:24.689> they<00:00:24.810> would<00:00:24.960> have

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
chose ICF's and what they would have

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.280 
chose ICF's and what they would have
done<00:00:25.110> differently

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:27.290

okay<00:00:28.290> well<00:00:28.560> it's<00:00:29.220> sort<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.550> big<00:00:29.700> house<00:00:29.880> but

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450 
okay well it's sort of a big house but

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.860 
okay well it's sort of a big house but
it's<00:00:30.930> really<00:00:30.989> only<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.470> four-bedroom<00:00:32.160> house<00:00:32.870> we

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
it's really only a four-bedroom house we

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.780 
it's really only a four-bedroom house we
call<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.350> modest<00:00:34.739> four-bedroom<00:00:35.370> starter

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
call it a modest four-bedroom starter

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.049 
castle
one<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.710> things<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.220> I<00:00:38.250> kind<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.910> regret

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
one of the things that I kind of regret

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.869 
one of the things that I kind of regret
is<00:00:39.539> not<00:00:39.840> taking<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.469> ICF<00:00:40.949> up<00:00:41.160> into<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.460> gables

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
is not taking the ICF up into the gables

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.270 
is not taking the ICF up into the gables
we<00:00:42.750> basically<00:00:43.079> stopped<00:00:43.500> at<00:00:43.769> the<00:00:43.920> at<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.820> top<00:00:45.109> I

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
we basically stopped at the at the top I

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.130 
we basically stopped at the at the top I
guess<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.429> reason<00:00:47.609> I<00:00:47.879> didn't<00:00:48.239> do<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.600> was<00:00:48.870> I

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
guess the reason I didn't do it was I

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.439 
guess the reason I didn't do it was I
was<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> little<00:00:49.500> bit<00:00:49.620> nervous<00:00:49.859> about<00:00:50.390> how<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
was a little bit nervous about how the

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.779 
was a little bit nervous about how the
process<00:00:51.960> would<00:00:52.050> work<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.589> thought<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.670> it

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
process would work and thought that it

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.729 
process would work and thought that it
would<00:00:53.910> be<00:00:53.940> okay<00:00:54.359> to<00:00:54.390> just<00:00:54.719> frame<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.170> but<00:00:55.410> you

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
would be okay to just frame it but you

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.829 
would be okay to just frame it but you
know<00:00:55.829> after<00:00:56.269> after<00:00:57.269> it's<00:00:57.390> all<00:00:57.480> said<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.719> done

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
know after after it's all said and done

00:00:57.839 --> 00:00:59.060 
know after after it's all said and done
I<00:00:57.960> wish<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.320> would<00:00:58.469> have<00:00:58.499> just<00:00:58.710> gone<00:00:58.890> with

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
I wish I would have just gone with

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.619 
I wish I would have just gone with
concrete<00:00:59.429> all<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.640> way<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.999> roof<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.510> you

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
concrete all the way to the roof so you

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.360 
concrete all the way to the roof so you
know<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.080> framing<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.650> never<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.190> never

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.370 
know the the framing is never it's never

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.190 
know the the framing is never it's never
as<00:01:05.610> good<00:01:05.670> it's<00:01:06.030> never<00:01:06.240> as<00:01:06.420> tight<00:01:06.690> it's<00:01:06.990> never

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
as good it's never as tight it's never

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.830 
as good it's never as tight it's never
as<00:01:07.380> strong<00:01:07.500> as<00:01:07.950> ICF<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.970> just<00:01:09.180> isn't<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.750> know

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
as strong as ICF it just isn't you know

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.660 
as strong as ICF it just isn't you know
we'll<00:01:10.590> go<00:01:10.710> up<00:01:10.770> there<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.010> look<00:01:11.190> we<00:01:11.370> can<00:01:11.490> kick

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
we'll go up there and look we can kick

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.230 
we'll go up there and look we can kick
on<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.060> little<00:01:12.410> so<00:01:13.730> but<00:01:14.730> yeah<00:01:14.850> that's<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
on it a little so but yeah that's the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.420 
on it a little so but yeah that's the
one<00:01:15.360> thing<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.780> regret<00:01:16.260> is<00:01:16.500> not<00:01:16.830> doing<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
one thing I regret is not doing the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.040 
one thing I regret is not doing the
gables<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:17.970> ICF<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.630> wouldn't<00:01:18.840> have<00:01:18.930> been<00:01:18.990> that

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
gables in ICF it wouldn't have been that

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.510 
gables in ICF it wouldn't have been that
much<00:01:19.320> more<00:01:19.500> money<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.010> they<00:01:20.100> would<00:01:20.310> have<00:01:20.400> been

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
much more money and they would have been

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.470 
much more money and they would have been
just<00:01:20.730> infinitely<00:01:21.180> stronger<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.280> better<00:01:23.480> so

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
just infinitely stronger and better so

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.290 
just infinitely stronger and better so
we're<00:01:24.750> up<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.350> attic<00:01:25.640> on<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.850> west<00:01:27.060> end<00:01:27.240> of

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
we're up in the attic on the west end of

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.050 
we're up in the attic on the west end of
the<00:01:27.360> house<00:01:27.540> at<00:01:27.870> the<00:01:27.900> gable<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.760> just

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
the house at the gable and this is just

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.050 
the house at the gable and this is just
you<00:01:30.390> know<00:01:30.420> an<00:01:30.600> example<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.110> where<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.950> wish<00:01:32.940> I

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
you know an example of where I wish I

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.820 
you know an example of where I wish I
would<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:33.240> used<00:01:33.420> ICF<00:01:33.930> instead<00:01:34.260> of<00:01:34.380> framing<00:01:34.740> I

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
would have used ICF instead of framing I

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.830 
would have used ICF instead of framing I
mean<00:01:34.980> you<00:01:35.220> know<00:01:35.310> it's<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.490> truss<00:01:35.820> it's<00:01:36.540> always

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
mean you know it's a truss it's always

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.690 
mean you know it's a truss it's always
be<00:01:38.090> if<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.300> would<00:01:39.450> been<00:01:39.770> ICF<00:01:40.770> there'd<00:01:41.370> be<00:01:41.550> no

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
be if it would been ICF there'd be no

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.190 
be if it would been ICF there'd be no
question<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.450> would<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.840> know<00:01:42.930> last

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
question that it would you know last

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.760 
question that it would you know last
forever

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
forever

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.030 
forever
you<00:01:44.490> know<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.900> its<00:01:45.900> OSB<00:01:48.500> it's<00:01:49.500> brick<00:01:49.770> on<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
you know I its OSB it's brick on the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.390 
you know I its OSB it's brick on the
outside<00:01:50.460> but<00:01:51.050> still<00:01:52.050> I<00:01:52.560> know<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.160> just<00:01:53.190> doesn't

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
outside but still I know it just doesn't

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.770 
outside but still I know it just doesn't
have<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.700> just<00:01:54.270> doesn't<00:01:54.480> give<00:01:54.570> me<00:01:54.630> that

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
have that just doesn't give me that

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.920 
have that just doesn't give me that
sense<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.110> security<00:01:55.260> that<00:01:55.800> that<00:01:55.920> ICF<00:01:56.610> does<00:01:56.930> you

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
sense of security that that ICF does you

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.210 
sense of security that that ICF does you
know<00:01:58.020> none<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.350> walls<00:01:58.560> downstairs<00:01:59.100> you

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
know none of the walls downstairs you

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.920 
know none of the walls downstairs you
can<00:01:59.340> hit<00:01:59.490> them<00:01:59.580> with<00:01:59.730> a<00:01:59.760> tree<00:02:00.150> and<00:02:00.390> nothing's

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
can hit them with a tree and nothing's

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.700 
can hit them with a tree and nothing's
gonna<00:02:01.020> happen

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
gonna happen

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.260 
gonna happen
anything's<00:02:02.460> ever<00:02:02.550> gonna<00:02:02.700> happen<00:02:03.030> it's

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
anything's ever gonna happen it's

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.360 
anything's ever gonna happen it's
probably<00:02:03.360> gonna<00:02:03.660> be<00:02:03.720> right<00:02:03.960> here<00:02:04.040> so<00:02:05.040> here's<00:02:05.310> a

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
probably gonna be right here so here's a

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.550 
probably gonna be right here so here's a
couple<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.760> examples<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.300> why<00:02:06.480> I<00:02:06.810> second-guess

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
couple of examples of why I second-guess

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.619 
couple of examples of why I second-guess
myself<00:02:07.770> with<00:02:08.190> respect<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.729> doing<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:09.149> see<00:02:09.360> up<00:02:09.509> in

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
myself with respect to doing I see up in

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.930 
myself with respect to doing I see up in
the<00:02:09.720> gables<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.800> probably<00:02:11.340> doesn't<00:02:11.550> make<00:02:11.760> any

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
the gables it probably doesn't make any

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.030 
the gables it probably doesn't make any
difference<00:02:12.150> with<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.750> brick<00:02:13.500> veneer<00:02:13.680> on<00:02:13.950> the

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
difference with the brick veneer on the

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.590 
difference with the brick veneer on the
outside<00:02:14.370> but<00:02:14.520> if<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.700> look<00:02:14.910> over<00:02:15.060> there<00:02:15.330> you

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
outside but if you look over there you

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.140 
outside but if you look over there you
can<00:02:16.200> see<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:17.310> framing<00:02:17.760> didn't<00:02:17.970> quite

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
can see the the framing didn't quite

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.559 
can see the the framing didn't quite
line<00:02:18.420> up<00:02:18.450> with<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:19.110> Mae

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
line up with the Mae

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.630 
line up with the Mae
senri<00:02:19.900> so<00:02:20.109> there's<00:02:20.349> a<00:02:20.409> quite<00:02:20.829> a<00:02:20.859> large<00:02:21.099> gap<00:02:21.370> on

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
senri so there's a quite a large gap on

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.059 
senri so there's a quite a large gap on
that<00:02:21.909> side<00:02:22.209> and<00:02:22.450> there's<00:02:23.019> a<00:02:23.079> smaller<00:02:23.530> gap<00:02:23.829> you

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
that side and there's a smaller gap you

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.229 
that side and there's a smaller gap you
can<00:02:24.099> see<00:02:24.310> some<00:02:24.459> light<00:02:24.489> coming<00:02:24.969> through<00:02:25.120> over

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
can see some light coming through over

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.080 
can see some light coming through over
there<00:02:25.480> could<00:02:25.989> have<00:02:26.019> been<00:02:26.139> ICF<00:02:26.790> we<00:02:27.790> would<00:02:27.969> have

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
there could have been ICF we would have

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.849 
there could have been ICF we would have
just<00:02:28.269> stacked<00:02:28.599> the<00:02:28.749> block<00:02:28.989> poured<00:02:29.530> it<00:02:29.709> the

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:29.859 
just stacked the block poured it the

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:30.869 
just stacked the block poured it the
cement<00:02:30.189> would<00:02:30.249> have<00:02:30.370> flowed<00:02:30.549> right<00:02:30.730> up

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
cement would have flowed right up

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.220 
cement would have flowed right up
against<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.209> masonry<00:02:31.719> would<00:02:32.049> have<00:02:32.139> been

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
against the masonry would have been

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.000 
against the masonry would have been
dialed<00:02:32.620> into<00:02:32.829> it<00:02:32.980> it<00:02:33.219> would<00:02:33.370> be<00:02:34.889> you<00:02:35.889> know

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
dialed into it it would be you know

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.289 
dialed into it it would be you know
without<00:02:36.909> any<00:02:37.329> sort<00:02:37.659> of<00:02:37.750> crack<00:02:38.230> at<00:02:38.500> all<00:02:38.680> but<00:02:39.299> you

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
without any sort of crack at all but you

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:45.990 
without any sort of crack at all but you
know<00:02:40.709> will<00:02:41.709> foam<00:02:42.010> it<00:02:42.189> up<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:45.400> elevator<00:02:45.760> will

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
know will foam it up the elevator will

although<00:03:03.010> we<00:03:03.219> got<00:03:03.370> some<00:03:03.519> floodlights<00:03:03.969> down

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
although we got some floodlights down

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.720 
although we got some floodlights down
here<00:03:04.510> I've<00:03:05.409> got<00:03:05.560> some<00:03:05.739> halogens<00:03:06.250> I<00:03:06.430> can<00:03:06.549> turn

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
here I've got some halogens I can turn

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:15.809 
here I've got some halogens I can turn
on<00:03:11.760> so<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:13.199> it<00:03:14.199> got<00:03:14.349> so<00:03:14.620> cold<00:03:14.829> this<00:03:15.069> winter<00:03:15.280> that

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
on so it it got so cold this winter that

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.899 
on so it it got so cold this winter that
this<00:03:16.000> beam<00:03:16.299> which<00:03:16.810> is<00:03:17.040> 90<00:03:18.040> some<00:03:18.250> odd<00:03:18.370> feet<00:03:18.609> long

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:18.909 
this beam which is 90 some odd feet long

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:24.300 
this beam which is 90 some odd feet long
shrank<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:22.109> you<00:03:23.109> can<00:03:23.260> see<00:03:23.469> exactly<00:03:23.799> where<00:03:24.189> it

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
shrank and you can see exactly where it

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.159 
shrank and you can see exactly where it
shrank<00:03:24.549> and<00:03:24.849> how<00:03:25.120> much<00:03:25.389> which<00:03:25.810> is<00:03:25.959> pretty

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:26.169 
shrank and how much which is pretty

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:30.030 
shrank and how much which is pretty
impressive<00:03:26.699> so<00:03:27.699> you<00:03:28.150> see<00:03:28.359> that<00:03:28.509> little<00:03:29.009> tab<00:03:30.009> a

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
impressive so you see that little tab a

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.030 
impressive so you see that little tab a
mortar<00:03:30.549> how<00:03:31.150> it's<00:03:31.359> pulled<00:03:31.599> away<00:03:31.750> from<00:03:32.229> from

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
mortar how it's pulled away from from

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.009 
mortar how it's pulled away from from
the<00:03:33.099> other<00:03:33.220> piece<00:03:33.489> of<00:03:33.639> mortar<00:03:33.939> that's<00:03:34.840> how

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
the other piece of mortar that's how

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.629 
the other piece of mortar that's how
much<00:03:35.199> that<00:03:35.379> beam<00:03:35.560> shrank<00:03:35.979> now<00:03:36.579> the

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:36.639 
much that beam shrank now the

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.399 
much that beam shrank now the
interesting<00:03:36.939> thing<00:03:37.150> is<00:03:37.419> it<00:03:37.569> pulled<00:03:37.780> away<00:03:37.900> but

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:38.409 
interesting thing is it pulled away but

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:40.409 
interesting thing is it pulled away but
it<00:03:38.500> didn't<00:03:38.739> go<00:03:38.829> back<00:03:39.069> and<00:03:39.909> when<00:03:40.090> it<00:03:40.209> pulled

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
it didn't go back and when it pulled

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:43.679 
it didn't go back and when it pulled
away<00:03:40.509> it<00:03:40.989> spalled<00:03:41.819> spalled<00:03:42.819> off<00:03:43.060> this<00:03:43.329> chip

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:43.689 
away it spalled spalled off this chip

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:46.469 
away it spalled spalled off this chip
off<00:03:43.900> this<00:03:44.049> block<00:03:44.379> and<00:03:45.040> you<00:03:45.879> can<00:03:46.030> actually<00:03:46.150> see

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:46.479 
off this block and you can actually see

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:48.240 
off this block and you can actually see
right<00:03:46.659> here<00:03:46.900> there's<00:03:47.169> a<00:03:47.229> little<00:03:47.379> line<00:03:47.680> where

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
right here there's a little line where

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.979 
right here there's a little line where
it<00:03:48.370> was<00:03:48.519> you<00:03:48.939> know<00:03:49.030> used<00:03:49.269> to<00:03:49.329> be<00:03:49.389> back<00:03:49.689> in<00:03:49.720> the

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
it was you know used to be back in the

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:51.420 
it was you know used to be back in the
cement<00:03:50.379> because<00:03:50.530> they<00:03:50.739> were<00:03:50.799> all<00:03:50.949> cemented

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
cement because they were all cemented

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.160 
cement because they were all cemented
into<00:03:51.549> place

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
into place

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.410 
into place
it<00:03:53.890> did<00:03:54.099> not<00:03:54.250> pull<00:03:54.550> out<00:03:54.580> from<00:03:54.910> the<00:03:55.030> other<00:03:55.180> end

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
it did not pull out from the other end

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.199 
it did not pull out from the other end
it<00:03:55.569> only<00:03:55.630> pulled<00:03:55.990> out<00:03:56.170> from<00:03:56.349> this<00:03:56.530> end<00:03:57.060> but<00:03:58.060> the

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
it only pulled out from this end but the

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.780 
it only pulled out from this end but the
mystery<00:03:58.540> is<00:03:58.599> why<00:03:59.319> it<00:03:59.380> didn't<00:04:00.010> go<00:04:00.040> back<00:04:00.310> I<00:04:00.520> did

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
mystery is why it didn't go back I did

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.350 
mystery is why it didn't go back I did
the<00:04:00.940> math<00:04:01.349> using<00:04:02.349> the<00:04:02.849> expansion<00:04:03.849> coefficient
