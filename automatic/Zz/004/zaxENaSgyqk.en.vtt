00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
Island to the Seabees Museum so these

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.850 
Island to the Seabees Museum so these
structures<00:01:12.610> were<00:01:12.910> designed<00:01:13.270> to<00:01:13.360> be<00:01:13.450> temporary

structures were designed to be temporary

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.139 
structures were designed to be temporary
yes<00:01:14.860> they<00:01:15.039> were<00:01:15.100> they<00:01:15.490> were<00:01:15.550> designed<00:01:16.000> by

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
yes they were they were designed by

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:18.210 
yes they were they were designed by
geniuses<00:01:16.750> so<00:01:16.930> that<00:01:17.080> any<00:01:17.229> serviceman<00:01:17.920> anywhere

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
geniuses so that any serviceman anywhere

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.560 
geniuses so that any serviceman anywhere
in<00:01:18.310> the<00:01:18.369> world<00:01:18.550> could<00:01:18.789> put<00:01:18.940> them<00:01:19.090> together<00:01:19.210> in

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
in the world could put them together in

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.450 
in the world could put them together in
a<00:01:19.630> couple<00:01:19.810> of<00:01:19.990> hours<00:01:20.380> and<00:01:20.649> this<00:01:20.979> one<00:01:21.190> is<00:01:21.310> unique

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
a couple of hours and this one is unique

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.180 
a couple of hours and this one is unique
because<00:01:21.759> it's<00:01:22.180> still<00:01:22.479> in<00:01:22.509> its<00:01:22.780> original

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
as I said we can find some organization

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.219 
as I said we can find some organization
or<00:02:02.619> some<00:02:03.149> wealthy<00:02:04.149> individual<00:02:04.750> that<00:02:04.899> thinks

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
or some wealthy individual that thinks

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.070 
or some wealthy individual that thinks
something<00:02:05.679> that<00:02:05.860> is<00:02:06.700> a<00:02:06.819> fairly<00:02:07.420> modern<00:02:07.720> venue

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
something that is a fairly modern venue

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.529 
something that is a fairly modern venue
is<00:02:08.530> worth<00:02:08.709> saving<00:02:09.190> I<00:02:09.340> know<00:02:09.399> George<00:02:09.849> Washington

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
is worth saving I know George Washington

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.030 
is worth saving I know George Washington
didn't<00:02:10.750> sleep<00:02:11.020> here<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.440> that<00:02:11.530> seems<00:02:11.770> to<00:02:11.830> be

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
didn't sleep here and that seems to be

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.130 
didn't sleep here and that seems to be
the<00:02:12.220> reason<00:02:12.880> that<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.150> major<00:02:13.510> historical

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
the reason that the major historical

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.710 
the reason that the major historical
groups<00:02:14.349> won't<00:02:14.680> get<00:02:14.830> behind<00:02:15.190> this<00:02:15.370> but<00:02:16.030> the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
groups won't get behind this but the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.420 
groups won't get behind this but the
nevertheless<00:02:17.140> it<00:02:17.500> makes<00:02:17.680> it<00:02:17.830> worth<00:02:17.950> saving

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
nevertheless it makes it worth saving

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.670 
nevertheless it makes it worth saving
and<00:02:18.459> we<00:02:19.180> just<00:02:19.510> have<00:02:19.690> a<00:02:19.720> few<00:02:19.810> days<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.349> do<00:02:20.500> this

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
and we just have a few days to do this

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.380 
and we just have a few days to do this
as<00:02:20.860> I<00:02:20.980> said<00:02:21.040> we've<00:02:21.370> had<00:02:21.580> many<00:02:21.790> people<00:02:22.180> come

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
as I said we've had many people come

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.420 
as I said we've had many people come
forward<00:02:22.660> before<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:24.010> they<00:02:24.130> were<00:02:24.220> going<00:02:24.370> to

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
move it here and move it there and that

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.050 
move it here and move it there and that
all<00:02:26.080> felt<00:02:26.410> true<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:27.340> we're<00:02:27.610> down<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.970> wire
