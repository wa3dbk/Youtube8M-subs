00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
control but could not get rid of them I

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.630 
control but could not get rid of them I
haven't<00:02:51.870> sprayed<00:02:52.230> lately<00:02:52.739> so<00:02:53.220> that's<00:02:53.459> why<00:02:53.609> we

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
haven't sprayed lately so that's why we

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.309 
haven't sprayed lately so that's why we
have<00:02:54.000> so<00:02:54.209> many<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.569> them<00:02:56.750> but<00:02:57.750> they're<00:02:57.959> trying

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
have so many of them but they're trying

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
to take care and take over everything

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.680

squash that they demolished I'm trying
to<00:03:22.799> grow<00:03:23.010> organically<00:03:23.639> and<00:03:24.200> I<00:03:25.200> haven't<00:03:25.680> found

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
to grow organically and I haven't found

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.890 
to grow organically and I haven't found
anything<00:03:26.280> that<00:03:26.519> would<00:03:26.849> just<00:03:27.090> eliminate<00:03:27.780> them

yet the Nemo worked fair spinoza's was
fair<00:03:34.739> but<00:03:35.280> nothing<00:03:35.669> would<00:03:35.819> just<00:03:36.090> wipe<00:03:36.359> them

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
fair but nothing would just wipe them

fair but nothing would just wipe them
out<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:37.970> I<00:03:38.970> can't<00:03:39.209> use<00:03:39.450> good<00:03:39.840> old<00:03:39.989> multi<00:03:40.440> on<00:03:40.709> or

seven<00:03:41.220> dust<00:03:43.549> so<00:03:44.549> if<00:03:44.639> you<00:03:44.730> don't<00:03:44.940> grow

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
seven dust so if you don't grow

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.409 
seven dust so if you don't grow
organically<00:03:46.040> try<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.099> liquid<00:03:47.609> seven<00:03:48.000> or

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
organically try the liquid seven or

organic folks have a little bit a little

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
bit more trouble hopefully next year

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.150

I'll<00:04:00.540> have<00:04:01.079> these<00:04:01.230> plants<00:04:01.680> out<00:04:01.799> on<00:04:01.919> the<00:04:01.980> ground

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160

I'll have these plants out on the ground
and<00:04:02.459> won't<00:04:02.609> have<00:04:02.730> to<00:04:02.879> use<00:04:02.910> these<00:04:03.299> containers

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
and won't have to use these containers

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.689
