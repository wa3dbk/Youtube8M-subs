really have to do this the old container
soil<00:00:09.269> really<00:00:09.990> has<00:00:10.200> had<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.559> life<00:00:10.740> sucked<00:00:11.099> out

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
soil really has had the life sucked out

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.860 
soil really has had the life sucked out
of<00:00:11.460> it<00:00:11.550> by<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.730> plants<00:00:12.300> that<00:00:12.330> are<00:00:12.420> growing<00:00:12.540> in

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
of it by the plants that are growing in

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.629 
of it by the plants that are growing in
there<00:00:13.110> so<00:00:13.500> you<00:00:13.559> need<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.950> add<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:14.370> some

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
there so you need to add in some

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.460 
there so you need to add in some
fertilizer<00:00:15.120> now<00:00:15.450> you're<00:00:15.870> not<00:00:15.990> going<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.230> fully

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
fertilizer now you're not going to fully

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.840 
fertilizer now you're not going to fully
fertilize<00:00:16.980> this<00:00:17.160> you're<00:00:17.340> just<00:00:17.520> getting<00:00:17.789> a

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
fertilize this you're just getting a

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.700 
fertilize this you're just getting a
little<00:00:18.000> bit<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:19.020> spread<00:00:19.289> out<00:00:19.410> through<00:00:19.680> the

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
little bit in to spread out through the

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.220 
little bit in to spread out through the
mix<00:00:20.039> when<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:20.939> plant<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.630> use<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:22.020> you're

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
mix when you plant and use this you're

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.290 
mix when you plant and use this you're
going<00:00:22.410> again<00:00:22.710> amend<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.609> soil<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:24.090> goes

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
going again amend that soil that goes

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.710 
going again amend that soil that goes
into<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.630> container<00:00:25.019> with<00:00:25.680> your<00:00:25.859> fertilizers

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
into the container with your fertilizers

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.470 
into the container with your fertilizers
so<00:00:27.859> go<00:00:28.859> ahead<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.369> dump<00:00:29.519> all<00:00:29.789> your<00:00:29.849> container

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
so go ahead and dump all your container

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.889 
so go ahead and dump all your container
soil<00:00:30.810> onto<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.410> tarp<00:00:32.149> you<00:00:33.149> can<00:00:33.329> let<00:00:33.510> this<00:00:33.660> go<00:00:33.870> for

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
soil onto a tarp you can let this go for

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.299 
soil onto a tarp you can let this go for
a<00:00:34.079> couple<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.440> days<00:00:34.590> but<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.890> really<00:00:35.100> want<00:00:35.250> to

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
a couple of days but you really want to

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.979 
a couple of days but you really want to
get<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.700> quickly<00:00:35.730> because<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.540> grass<00:00:36.750> may

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
get to it quickly because the grass may

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.869 
get to it quickly because the grass may
die<00:00:37.200> out<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.890> want<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.160> do<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.399> early<00:00:38.850> in

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
die out and you want to do it early in

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.700 
die out and you want to do it early in
the<00:00:39.059> spring<00:00:39.390> when<00:00:39.570> it's<00:00:39.719> cooler<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.590> it

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
the spring when it's cooler so it

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.650 
the spring when it's cooler so it
doesn't<00:00:41.010> really<00:00:41.180> kill<00:00:42.180> off<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.450> grass

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
doesn't really kill off the grass

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.049 
doesn't really kill off the grass
underneath<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.320> dump<00:00:43.530> your<00:00:43.680> soil<00:00:43.950> out<00:00:44.190> remove

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
underneath so dump your soil out remove

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.610 
underneath so dump your soil out remove
any<00:00:45.239> debris<00:00:45.420> that's<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.200> there<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.379> you

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
any debris that's in there that you

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.139 
any debris that's in there that you
don't<00:00:46.860> want<00:00:47.070> break<00:00:47.309> up<00:00:47.489> all<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.670> root<00:00:47.940> balls

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
don't want break up all the root balls

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.420 
don't want break up all the root balls
make<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.840> nice<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.020> loose<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.500> also<00:00:50.100> don't

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
make it nice and loose and also don't

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.900 
make it nice and loose and also don't
use<00:00:50.850> any<00:00:51.239> container<00:00:51.600> soil<00:00:52.250> that<00:00:53.250> had<00:00:53.520> plants

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
use any container soil that had plants

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.250 
use any container soil that had plants
in<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.210> got<00:00:54.360> diseased<00:00:54.690> get<00:00:54.930> rid<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.140> that

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
in it that got diseased get rid of that

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.119 
in it that got diseased get rid of that
soil<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.340> about<00:00:56.719> 18<00:00:58.129> 5-gallon

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
soil so this is about 18 5-gallon

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.849 
soil so this is about 18 5-gallon
buckets<00:00:59.550> worth<00:00:59.760> of<00:01:00.059> container<00:01:00.570> soil<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
buckets worth of container soil and the

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.619 
buckets worth of container soil and the
way<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.039> do<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.760> just<00:01:02.910> sort<00:01:03.539> of

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
way you do that is you just sort of

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.320 
way you do that is you just sort of
eyeball<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.619> number<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.920> containers<00:01:05.330> these

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
eyeball the number of containers these

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.240 
eyeball the number of containers these
are<00:01:06.540> all<00:01:06.689> five<00:01:07.170> gallon<00:01:07.560> containers<00:01:08.070> right

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
are all five gallon containers right

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.660 
are all five gallon containers right
here

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
here

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.859 
here
so<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.979> end<00:01:10.979> up<00:01:11.070> with<00:01:11.130> eighteen<00:01:11.970> five<00:01:12.450> gallon

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
so I end up with eighteen five gallon

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.160 
so I end up with eighteen five gallon
containers<00:01:13.380> worth<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.979> soil<00:01:14.630> you're<00:01:15.630> going<00:01:15.990> to

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
containers worth of soil you're going to

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.340 
containers worth of soil you're going to
fertilize<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.950> at<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.880> one-third<00:01:18.509> intensity<00:01:19.140> so

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
fertilize it at a one-third intensity so

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.330 
fertilize it at a one-third intensity so
if<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.939> watch<00:01:21.119> my<00:01:21.360> other<00:01:21.390> videos<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:22.380> five

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
if you watch my other videos a five

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.280 
if you watch my other videos a five
gallon<00:01:23.549> container<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:24.360> about<00:01:24.630> one<00:01:24.900> square

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
gallon container is about one square

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.920 
gallon container is about one square
foot<00:01:25.530> worth<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:26.330> fertilizer<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.509> if<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.720> read

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
foot worth of fertilizer and if you read

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.480 
foot worth of fertilizer and if you read
the<00:01:28.140> different<00:01:28.320> packages<00:01:28.979> they<00:01:29.130> tell<00:01:29.340> you

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
the different packages they tell you

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.510 
the different packages they tell you
usually<00:01:30.030> one<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.869> two<00:01:31.049> tablespoons<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:32.220> a

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
usually one to two tablespoons in a

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.800 
usually one to two tablespoons in a
square<00:01:32.850> foot<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:34.409> 18<00:01:34.950> five<00:01:35.250> gallon

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
square foot so I have 18 five gallon

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.569 
square foot so I have 18 five gallon
containers<00:01:36.810> worth<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.229> container<00:01:37.920> soil<00:01:38.250> here

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
containers worth of container soil here

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.340 
containers worth of container soil here
one<00:01:39.509> third<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.350> six<00:01:41.060> so<00:01:42.079> this<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.229> how

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
one third of that is six so this is how

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.109 
one third of that is six so this is how
you'll<00:01:43.530> break<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.890> down<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.700> all-purpose

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
you'll break it down the all-purpose

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.940 
you'll break it down the all-purpose
plant<00:01:45.570> food<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.170> non-organic

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
plant food the non-organic

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.870 
plant food the non-organic
I'll<00:01:47.640> put<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.149> one<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.780> two<00:01:48.960> tablespoons

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
I'll put in one to two tablespoons

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.490 
I'll put in one to two tablespoons
because<00:01:50.880> that's<00:01:51.030> what<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.270> says<00:01:51.509> per

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
because that's what it says per

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.700 
because that's what it says per
five-gallon<00:01:53.460> container<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:54.210> six<00:01:55.640> to<00:01:56.640> twelve

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
five-gallon container so six to twelve

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.080 
five-gallon container so six to twelve
scoops<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:58.920> fertilizer<00:01:59.520> would<00:01:59.759> go<00:01:59.939> in

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
scoops of that fertilizer would go in

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.209 
scoops of that fertilizer would go in
there<00:02:00.299> by<00:02:00.719> itself<00:02:01.110> that's<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.619> lot<00:02:01.829> less<00:02:02.009> than

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
there by itself that's a lot less than

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.010 
there by itself that's a lot less than
you<00:02:02.280> need<00:02:02.610> but<00:02:03.240> you're<00:02:03.329> just<00:02:03.570> getting<00:02:03.899> this

old topsoil but you really want to try

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.050 
old topsoil but you really want to try
and<00:03:42.630> get<00:03:42.840> in<00:03:42.959> compost<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:43.799> peat<00:03:44.190> moss<00:03:44.370> because

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
and get in compost and peat moss because

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.520 
and get in compost and peat moss because
that<00:03:45.329> will<00:03:45.510> hold<00:03:45.690> water<00:03:45.900> and<00:03:46.200> that<00:03:46.319> will<00:03:46.410> help

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
that will hold water and that will help

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.020 
that will hold water and that will help
you<00:03:46.680> with<00:03:46.799> watering<00:03:47.130> issues<00:03:47.489> over<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:47.819> time

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
you with watering issues over the time

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.680 
you with watering issues over the time
so<00:03:48.480> I'm<00:03:48.600> going<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:49.139> put<00:03:49.319> in<00:03:50.239> three<00:03:51.239> buckets<00:03:51.389> of

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
so I'm going to put in three buckets of

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.640 
so I'm going to put in three buckets of
peat<00:03:51.870> moss<00:03:51.989> here<00:03:52.380> three<00:03:52.889> buckets<00:03:53.190> of<00:03:53.400> compost

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
peat moss here three buckets of compost

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.199 
peat moss here three buckets of compost
throwing<00:03:55.650> my<00:03:55.739> fertilizer<00:03:56.010> I'll<00:03:56.579> mix<00:03:56.790> this<00:03:56.970> all

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
throwing my fertilizer I'll mix this all

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.590 
throwing my fertilizer I'll mix this all
together<00:03:57.420> and<00:03:57.870> that<00:03:58.380> is<00:03:59.040> what<00:03:59.310> I'll<00:03:59.430> use<00:03:59.600> for

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
together and that is what I'll use for

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.180 
together and that is what I'll use for
this<00:04:00.750> season<00:04:01.170> and<00:04:01.350> that's<00:04:01.470> how<00:04:01.620> you<00:04:01.680> refresh

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
this season and that's how you refresh

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.129 
this season and that's how you refresh
your<00:04:02.459> container<00:04:02.819> soil<00:04:03.120> I<00:04:03.299> amended<00:04:03.750> container

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
your container soil I amended container

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.920 
your container soil I amended container
soil<00:04:04.500> and<00:04:04.739> remember<00:04:05.190> we<00:04:05.850> only<00:04:06.000> fed<00:04:06.780> it

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
soil and remember we only fed it

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.729 
soil and remember we only fed it
fertilized<00:04:07.560> it<00:04:07.829> at<00:04:08.100> one<00:04:08.700> third<00:04:09.000> its<00:04:09.930> volume<00:04:10.410> so

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
fertilized it at one third its volume so

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.670 
fertilized it at one third its volume so
we<00:04:10.859> took<00:04:11.010> care<00:04:11.069> of<00:04:11.250> it<00:04:11.370> as<00:04:11.489> if<00:04:11.670> this<00:04:11.819> was<00:04:12.000> only

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
we took care of it as if this was only

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.500 
we took care of it as if this was only
what<00:04:13.680> was<00:04:13.829> that<00:04:13.980> six<00:04:14.340> five<00:04:14.819> gallon<00:04:15.209> buckets

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
what was that six five gallon buckets

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.180 
what was that six five gallon buckets
worth<00:04:15.690> of<00:04:15.870> soil<00:04:16.049> and<00:04:16.229> the<00:04:16.590> reason<00:04:16.889> I<00:04:16.979> do<00:04:17.039> that

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
worth of soil and the reason I do that

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.729 
worth of soil and the reason I do that
is<00:04:17.370> when<00:04:17.609> I<00:04:17.639> prepare<00:04:18.150> a<00:04:18.180> container<00:04:18.780> for<00:04:19.680> a

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
is when I prepare a container for a

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.190 
is when I prepare a container for a
plant<00:04:20.039> I<00:04:20.310> like<00:04:20.639> to<00:04:20.760> add<00:04:20.910> in<00:04:21.120> fertilizers<00:04:21.989> or

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
plant I like to add in fertilizers or

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.469 
plant I like to add in fertilizers or
nutrients<00:04:23.190> that<00:04:23.370> are<00:04:23.580> needed<00:04:23.909> for<00:04:23.940> that<00:04:24.210> plant

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
nutrients that are needed for that plant

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.420 
nutrients that are needed for that plant
so<00:04:24.720> this<00:04:24.810> one<00:04:24.990> will<00:04:25.080> be<00:04:25.140> prepared<00:04:25.680> for<00:04:26.340> a

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
so this one will be prepared for a

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.249 
so this one will be prepared for a
for<00:04:28.430> a<00:04:28.460> tomato<00:04:28.819> plant<00:04:29.060> and<00:04:29.360> what<00:04:29.840> I<00:04:29.870> do<00:04:29.960> is<00:04:30.169> I

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:30.259 
for a tomato plant and what I do is I

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:32.110 
for a tomato plant and what I do is I
put<00:04:30.469> in<00:04:30.560> the<00:04:30.710> container<00:04:30.979> soil<00:04:31.340> to<00:04:31.669> about<00:04:31.879> this

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
put in the container soil to about this

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.110 
put in the container soil to about this
depth<00:04:32.449> I<00:04:32.719> put<00:04:33.500> in<00:04:33.650> fertilizer<00:04:34.280> over<00:04:34.610> here<00:04:34.939> and

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
depth I put in fertilizer over here and

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.450 
depth I put in fertilizer over here and
half-strength<00:04:35.629> and<00:04:35.900> gypsum<00:04:36.680> over<00:04:36.949> here<00:04:37.310> at

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
half-strength and gypsum over here at

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.499 
half-strength and gypsum over here at
half-strength

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:38.509 
half-strength

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:41.589 
half-strength
because<00:04:39.610> tomatoes<00:04:40.610> are<00:04:41.060> known<00:04:41.240> to<00:04:41.449> get

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:41.599 
because tomatoes are known to get

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:43.179 
because tomatoes are known to get
blossom<00:04:41.990> end<00:04:42.139> rot<00:04:42.199> you<00:04:42.439> definitely<00:04:42.889> want<00:04:43.099> the

00:04:43.179 --> 00:04:43.189 
blossom end rot you definitely want the

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:44.679 
blossom end rot you definitely want the
additional<00:04:43.550> calcium<00:04:43.759> and<00:04:44.180> they're<00:04:44.539> heavy

00:04:44.679 --> 00:04:44.689 
additional calcium and they're heavy

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:46.959 
additional calcium and they're heavy
feeders<00:04:45.139> so<00:04:45.379> you<00:04:45.830> want<00:04:46.039> a<00:04:46.099> well<00:04:46.430> balanced

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:46.969 
feeders so you want a well balanced

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:49.959 
feeders so you want a well balanced
fertilizer<00:04:47.419> put<00:04:47.719> in<00:04:47.840> there<00:04:47.990> you<00:04:48.530> can<00:04:48.710> see<00:04:48.979> it's

00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:49.969 
fertilizer put in there you can see it's

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:51.700 
fertilizer put in there you can see it's
really<00:04:50.389> loose<00:04:50.569> so<00:04:50.870> I<00:04:50.900> would<00:04:51.110> mix<00:04:51.289> all<00:04:51.500> of<00:04:51.620> this

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
really loose so I would mix all of this

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.920 
really loose so I would mix all of this
in<00:04:51.979> all<00:04:52.729> the<00:04:52.789> way<00:04:52.939> down<00:04:53.150> to<00:04:53.360> the<00:04:53.479> bottom<00:04:53.810> and

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
in all the way down to the bottom and

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.409 
in all the way down to the bottom and
then<00:04:54.439> I<00:04:54.530> fill<00:04:54.800> the<00:04:54.949> top<00:04:55.159> up<00:04:55.430> with<00:04:55.639> some<00:04:56.240> more

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
then I fill the top up with some more

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:01.510 
then I fill the top up with some more
peat<00:04:56.689> moss<00:04:56.840> because<00:04:57.530> you<00:04:57.800> want<00:05:00.520> water

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
peat moss because you want water

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.219 
peat moss because you want water
retention<00:05:01.909> in<00:05:02.180> your<00:05:02.330> containers<00:05:02.840> that's<00:05:03.050> one

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
retention in your containers that's one

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.290 
retention in your containers that's one
of<00:05:03.349> the<00:05:03.439> biggest<00:05:03.680> problems<00:05:04.250> and<00:05:04.580> I<00:05:05.000> would<00:05:05.150> just

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
of the biggest problems and I would just

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.029 
of the biggest problems and I would just
level<00:05:05.960> that<00:05:06.080> out<00:05:06.259> mix<00:05:06.590> it<00:05:06.710> all<00:05:06.800> the<00:05:06.949> way

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
level that out mix it all the way

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.189 
level that out mix it all the way
through<00:05:07.370> and<00:05:07.580> then<00:05:08.029> this<00:05:08.180> bucket<00:05:08.599> is<00:05:08.719> prepared

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 
through and then this bucket is prepared

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.350 
through and then this bucket is prepared
for<00:05:09.469> a<00:05:09.529> tomato<00:05:09.740> plant<00:05:10.009> if<00:05:10.520> I<00:05:10.669> was<00:05:10.819> going<00:05:11.150> to

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
for a tomato plant if I was going to

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.129 
for a tomato plant if I was going to
plant<00:05:11.840> peas<00:05:12.110> in<00:05:12.319> here<00:05:12.349> I<00:05:12.740> would<00:05:13.219> just<00:05:13.370> use<00:05:14.139> the

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
plant peas in here I would just use the

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:16.809 
plant peas in here I would just use the
soil<00:05:15.379> right<00:05:15.560> there<00:05:15.770> that<00:05:15.979> I<00:05:16.009> amended<00:05:16.430> because

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:16.819 
soil right there that I amended because

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:18.580 
soil right there that I amended because
they<00:05:17.000> fix<00:05:17.270> their<00:05:17.360> own<00:05:17.449> nitrogen<00:05:17.990> so<00:05:18.439> they

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
they fix their own nitrogen so they

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.709 
they fix their own nitrogen so they
don't<00:05:18.770> need<00:05:19.009> the<00:05:19.370> calcium<00:05:19.909> they<00:05:20.360> don't<00:05:20.569> need

00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:20.719 
don't need the calcium they don't need

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:22.390 
don't need the calcium they don't need
the<00:05:20.930> extra<00:05:20.960> fertilizer<00:05:21.710> if<00:05:21.949> I<00:05:22.039> was<00:05:22.159> going<00:05:22.340> to

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
the extra fertilizer if I was going to

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.550 
the extra fertilizer if I was going to
plant<00:05:22.580> a<00:05:22.639> pepper<00:05:22.879> plant<00:05:23.210> in<00:05:23.330> here<00:05:23.569> I<00:05:23.719> would

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
plant a pepper plant in here I would

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.230 
plant a pepper plant in here I would
still<00:05:25.159> put<00:05:25.279> in<00:05:25.400> the<00:05:25.460> calcium<00:05:25.879> they<00:05:25.969> can<00:05:26.120> get

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
still put in the calcium they can get

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
blossom end rot too and I would not use

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.300 
blossom end rot too and I would not use
that<00:05:29.029> well<00:05:29.270> balanced<00:05:29.629> fertilizer<00:05:30.310> peppers

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
that well balanced fertilizer peppers

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.760 
that well balanced fertilizer peppers
tend<00:05:31.550> to<00:05:31.639> do<00:05:31.759> better<00:05:32.000> without<00:05:32.839> nitrogen<00:05:33.620> I'm

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
tend to do better without nitrogen I'm

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.399 
tend to do better without nitrogen I'm
not<00:05:34.460> I'm<00:05:34.699> sorry<00:05:34.940> not<00:05:35.210> without<00:05:35.509> nitrogen<00:05:36.020> with

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:36.409 
not I'm sorry not without nitrogen with

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:37.779 
not I'm sorry not without nitrogen with
less<00:05:36.650> nitrogen<00:05:36.889> if<00:05:37.219> you<00:05:37.310> put<00:05:37.490> too<00:05:37.610> much<00:05:37.639> in

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:37.789 
less nitrogen if you put too much in

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:39.519 
less nitrogen if you put too much in
there<00:05:38.000> they<00:05:38.150> get<00:05:38.270> kind<00:05:38.509> of<00:05:38.599> leafy<00:05:38.960> so<00:05:39.379> this

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:39.529 
there they get kind of leafy so this

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:42.029 
there they get kind of leafy so this
would<00:05:39.680> probably<00:05:39.710> be<00:05:40.190> more<00:05:41.029> blood<00:05:41.419> meal<00:05:41.629> I

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
would probably be more blood meal I

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:43.749 
would probably be more blood meal I
don't<00:05:43.039> know<00:05:43.099> what<00:05:43.250> I'm<00:05:43.339> saying

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:43.759 
don't know what I'm saying

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:46.420 
don't know what I'm saying
this<00:05:44.029> would<00:05:44.240> be<00:05:44.449> more<00:05:44.719> bone<00:05:45.080> meal<00:05:45.379> because<00:05:46.310> of

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
this would be more bone meal because of

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.519 
this would be more bone meal because of
the<00:05:46.520> phosphorus<00:05:46.699> value<00:05:47.449> that's<00:05:47.930> in<00:05:48.139> there<00:05:48.379> and

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:48.529 
the phosphorus value that's in there and

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:50.559 
the phosphorus value that's in there and
phosphorus<00:05:49.370> tends<00:05:49.580> to<00:05:49.729> really<00:05:49.940> help<00:05:50.120> your

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:50.569 
phosphorus tends to really help your

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:53.800 
phosphorus tends to really help your
peppers<00:05:50.990> bloom<00:05:51.529> and<00:05:51.879> grow<00:05:52.879> fruit<00:05:53.300> you<00:05:53.539> don't

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
peppers bloom and grow fruit you don't

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.809 
peppers bloom and grow fruit you don't
want<00:05:53.990> a<00:05:54.020> lot<00:05:54.169> of<00:05:54.199> nitrogen<00:05:54.650> but<00:05:55.310> this<00:05:55.490> way<00:05:55.669> if

00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:55.819 
want a lot of nitrogen but this way if

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:58.209 
want a lot of nitrogen but this way if
you<00:05:55.939> set<00:05:56.150> up<00:05:56.270> your<00:05:56.389> soil<00:05:56.599> at<00:05:57.319> one-third

00:05:58.209 --> 00:05:58.219 
you set up your soil at one-third

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:00.369 
you set up your soil at one-third
strength<00:05:58.610> of<00:05:58.819> nutrients<00:05:59.629> and<00:05:59.719> feed<00:05:59.960> put<00:06:00.259> in

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:00.379 
strength of nutrients and feed put in

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:04.390 
strength of nutrients and feed put in
some<00:06:00.979> new<00:06:01.129> soil<00:06:01.569> peat<00:06:02.569> moss<00:06:02.719> compost<00:06:03.400> lighten
