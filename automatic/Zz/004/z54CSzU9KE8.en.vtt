00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
time the older dirt games but this just

time the older dirt games but this just
this<00:02:22.470> just<00:02:22.530> feels<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:23.070> lot<00:02:23.370> better<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.940> tracks

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
this just feels a lot better the tracks

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.180 
this just feels a lot better the tracks

with now in this video are faster than

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.380 
with now in this video are faster than
me<00:02:46.620> for<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.920> most<00:02:47.130> part<00:02:47.400> which<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:47.730> quite

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
me for the most part which is quite

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.630 
me for the most part which is quite
depressing<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.200> really<00:02:49.470> did<00:02:49.680> bruise<00:02:50.070> my<00:02:50.250> ego

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
depressing and really did bruise my ego

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.340 
depressing and really did bruise my ego
considering<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:51.540> code<00:02:51.810> masters<00:02:52.170> who<00:02:52.260> have

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
considering that code masters who have

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.380 
considering that code masters who have
even<00:02:52.590> said<00:02:52.890> that<00:02:53.460> on<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.730> hardest<00:02:54.240> setting

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
even said that on the hardest setting

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.940 
even said that on the hardest setting
the<00:02:54.540> AI<00:02:54.630> stood<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.110> little<00:02:55.380> bit<00:02:55.530> slow<00:02:55.770> because

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
the AI stood a little bit slow because

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.590 
the AI stood a little bit slow because
they're<00:02:56.460> tweaking<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.880> AI<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.360> i<00:02:57.420> want<00:02:57.570> to

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
they're tweaking the AI and i want to

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.210 
they're tweaking the AI and i want to
make<00:02:57.660> it<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.020> AI<00:02:58.140> don't<00:02:58.560> murder<00:02:58.830> you<00:02:59.190> and

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
make it to the AI don't murder you and

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.460 
make it to the AI don't murder you and
actually<00:02:59.820> drive<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.180> nice<00:03:00.360> line<00:03:00.630> so<00:03:01.380> they

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
actually drive a nice line so they

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.390 
actually drive a nice line so they
hardly<00:03:01.710> say<00:03:01.860> i<00:03:01.890> was<00:03:02.100> going<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.280> get<00:03:02.370> even

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
hardly say i was going to get even

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.920 
hardly say i was going to get even
faster<00:03:02.820> which<00:03:03.150> is<00:03:03.270> gonna<00:03:03.360> make<00:03:03.450> me<00:03:03.600> looking

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
faster which is gonna make me looking

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.140 
faster which is gonna make me looking
for<00:03:04.080> slower<00:03:04.290> but<00:03:04.950> i<00:03:05.010> have<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.190> say<00:03:05.310> they<00:03:05.580> always

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
for slower but i have to say they always

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.300 
for slower but i have to say they always
really<00:03:06.540> nicely<00:03:06.720> done<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.320> i<00:03:07.380> think<00:03:07.620> what's

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
really nicely done and i think what's

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.890 
really nicely done and i think what's
especially<00:03:08.610> nice<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.120> how<00:03:09.270> it<00:03:09.420> scales<00:03:09.720> up

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
especially nice is how it scales up

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.180 
especially nice is how it scales up
through<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.200> different<00:03:10.560> difficulty

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
through the different difficulty

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.500 
through the different difficulty
settings<00:03:11.520> so<00:03:11.640> those<00:03:11.760> with<00:03:11.940> let's<00:03:12.120> go<00:03:12.240> can<00:03:12.420> put

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
settings so those with let's go can put

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.090 
settings so those with let's go can put
it<00:03:12.600> on<00:03:12.690> easy<00:03:12.840> AI<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:13.500> still<00:03:13.890> have<00:03:14.010> an

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
it on easy AI and still have an

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.060 
it on easy AI and still have an
absolutely<00:03:14.610> cracking<00:03:14.910> race<00:03:15.270> and<00:03:16.070> obviously

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
absolutely cracking race and obviously

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.650 
absolutely cracking race and obviously
as<00:03:17.190> I<00:03:17.250> say<00:03:17.430> kobus<00:03:17.820> are<00:03:17.940> gonna<00:03:18.030> improve<00:03:18.270> the<00:03:18.390> iso

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
as I say kobus are gonna improve the iso

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.850 
as I say kobus are gonna improve the iso
those<00:03:18.870> of<00:03:18.990> you<00:03:19.080> that<00:03:19.170> have<00:03:19.290> actually<00:03:19.380> bothered

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
those of you that have actually bothered

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.530 
those of you that have actually bothered
to<00:03:19.890> learn<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.760> track<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.240> I've<00:03:21.300> got<00:03:21.450> your

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
to learn the the track and I've got your

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.730 
to learn the the track and I've got your
car<00:03:21.720> handling<00:03:22.080> down<00:03:22.290> I've<00:03:22.410> had<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.530> lot<00:03:22.680> of

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
car handling down I've had a lot of

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.010 
car handling down I've had a lot of
practice<00:03:23.100> with<00:03:23.190> dirt<00:03:23.400> rally<00:03:23.610> then<00:03:24.210> I'm<00:03:24.750> sure

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020
