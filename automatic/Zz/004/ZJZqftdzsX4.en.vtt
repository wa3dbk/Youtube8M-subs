 how chilling are the natural teeth lost 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.109
 this is done in an absurd way of planning nowadays 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.859
 it is extremely he is the only one for each patient 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.620
 often this rehabilitation encompasses 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:47.880
 is a different date the areas of dentistry then often only with 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.340
 he would need a garden dongxiang 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.780
 that is to say the correction of the goods owning the position of the teeth with apparatus 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.550
 would need stoned had to be a gum treatment 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.590
 she would need implants 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.120
 anyone can make implants 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.010
 yea 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.900
 as long as it complies as it is followed there is a protocol one 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.450
 sequence of plots that must be followed where the first step is something 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.820
 requested professional 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.820
 an examination provides for this general condition of the patient's health 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.740
 she is fit 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.460
 for performing implant surgeries 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.870
 and if there is no authorship or thickness and bold authorship 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.760
 yea 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.720
 and closed 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.810
 it is ours we do not allow a patient to receive implants for the sake of 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.750
 absence of August 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.880
 because today we got that rebuilt girl through 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.900
 techniques is this possible and what are these techniques 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.060
 to be currently used 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.260
 The story of uncertainty at the right time follows an evolution 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.790
 in italy the terms from the beginning 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.780
 where even today some professionals use the collection to be 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.470
 your 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.470
 is from parts of the hip skull 

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:11.370
 but the shepherd but later after saw 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.760
 collection of fragments from the inside of the mouth would be interesting to 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.789
 this here 

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:18.819
 is from the chin region 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.179
 of the posterior region 

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:22.849
 not the jaw 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.400
 only they are techniques that have soul 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.780
 one of the disadvantages in the sense of 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.550
 cause a slightly more painful and painful postoperative period than the patient 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.520
 because we are going to give work in two surgical areas but you use one 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.460
 technique that is innovative and see us a little account about this skill 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.819
 it is a technique that she that actually I work with bone substitutes 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.010
 and in admixture with a portion of blood 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.099
 this formed today is something that is essential high 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:57.509
 area where I want to do is if this growth of honshu 

00:02:57.509 --> 00:03:02.439
 we wait for a time which is a time with the standard for all the techniques of 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:07.249
 six months this is material all he will be changed by the face of himself 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:08.919
 patient 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:14.329
 and that he has the great advantage of ordering is in the works only with 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:15.819
 surgical areas 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.639
 then postoperative that the patient is extremely comfortable which is a 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.579
 fast technique 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.579
 it's actually we have a complex problem 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.699
 and we can solve it in a simple way there can be exemption 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:36.549
 not only until there is a great evoked with the relationship that word rejection 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.439
 neno implants and near leisure 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:43.790
 rejection is when your body will receive a body 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.459
 and at the right time and receive even recognizes that elements like this begin to fight 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:50.609
 against him 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:56.020
 the bone graft implant highly biocompatible materials I be 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.090
 they have total affinity with the body so the revision does not exist 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.620
 and once done implant should have some care taken care of with these loss 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.499
 this session is important 

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:11.339
 is to see people have a misconception that since implant I do not need more 

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:14.339
 caution 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.019
 I received implants at 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.789
 which extinguishes the professional to follow up like any other 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:25.199
 treatment or on any other topic dealt with in spite of the very 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:28.260
 thank you for your presence here it was a pleasure to receive the works is made of 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:32.030
 honey brigade we are also here to support the team at the quarry 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.900
 who is a master in implantology 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.190
 he does is perfect but they are the responsibility of the city hall
