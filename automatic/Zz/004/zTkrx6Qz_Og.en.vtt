avid web builder from Brazil so it's a
new<00:03:57.569> world<00:03:57.750> species<00:03:58.139> it's<00:03:58.590> not<00:03:58.739> a<00:03:58.769> tarantula

00:03:59.179 --> 00:03:59.189 
new world species it's not a tarantula

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.869 
new world species it's not a tarantula
as<00:03:59.430> it<00:03:59.819> doesn't<00:04:00.030> have<00:04:00.299> educating<00:04:01.200> hair<00:04:01.439> and<00:04:01.879> it

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
doesn't have the feet that tarantulas do

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.750 
doesn't have the feet that tarantulas do
have<00:04:06.359> but<00:04:07.290> they<00:04:07.409> have<00:04:07.560> very<00:04:07.590> similar<00:04:08.099> working

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
have but they have very similar working

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.149 
have but they have very similar working
Cloris<00:04:09.419> ear<00:04:09.599> I<00:04:09.720> and<00:04:10.169> their<00:04:10.530> jaws<00:04:10.739> that<00:04:11.010> they

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
Cloris ear I and their jaws that they

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.300 
Cloris ear I and their jaws that they
open<00:04:11.280> upward<00:04:11.790> and<00:04:11.970> downward<00:04:12.319> motion<00:04:13.319> but<00:04:13.709> what

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
open upward and downward motion but what

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.000 
open upward and downward motion but what
really<00:04:14.609> is<00:04:14.940> gives<00:04:15.900> a<00:04:16.079> great<00:04:16.320> characteristic

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
really is gives a great characteristic

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.300 
really is gives a great characteristic
of<00:04:17.099> this<00:04:17.870> species<00:04:18.870> is<00:04:19.169> the<00:04:19.620> oversized

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
of this species is the oversized

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.210 
of this species is the oversized
spinnerets<00:04:21.269> that<00:04:21.419> they<00:04:21.539> have<00:04:21.770> so<00:04:22.770> maybe<00:04:22.979> if<00:04:23.099> I

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
spinnerets that they have so maybe if I

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.680 
spinnerets that they have so maybe if I
brought<00:04:23.610> out<00:04:23.729> together<00:04:23.880> side<00:04:24.330> you'll<00:04:24.510> be<00:04:24.630> able

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
brought out together side you'll be able

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.830 
brought out together side you'll be able
to<00:04:24.870> see<00:04:25.080> it<00:04:25.229> I<00:04:26.240> mean<00:04:27.240> this<00:04:27.389> is<00:04:27.539> like<00:04:27.570> a

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
to see it I mean this is like a

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.939 
to see it I mean this is like a
monstrous<00:04:29.150> size<00:04:30.470> so<00:04:31.470> I<00:04:31.500> thought<00:04:31.740> you<00:04:31.800> know

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
monstrous size so I thought you know

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:33.860 
monstrous size so I thought you know
it's<00:04:32.310> pretty<00:04:32.639> unique<00:04:32.760> since<00:04:33.240> I<00:04:33.419> don't<00:04:33.690> have

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
it's pretty unique since I don't have

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.020 
it's pretty unique since I don't have
any<00:04:34.260> of<00:04:34.620> these<00:04:34.830> is<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:35.370> first<00:04:35.610> one<00:04:35.849> and

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
any of these is the first one and

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.909 
any of these is the first one and
possibly<00:04:36.630> there's<00:04:37.139> not<00:04:37.289> much<00:04:37.590> information

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
possibly there's not much information

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.350 
possibly there's not much information
about<00:04:38.460> the<00:04:38.639> Sun<00:04:39.139> youtube<00:04:40.139> so<00:04:40.440> i<00:04:41.300> don't<00:04:42.300> know

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
about the Sun youtube so i don't know

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.850 
about the Sun youtube so i don't know
pretty<00:04:42.599> much<00:04:42.630> about<00:04:42.930> it<00:04:43.080> so<00:04:43.110> i'm<00:04:43.320> going<00:04:43.620> to<00:04:43.740> do

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
pretty much about it so i'm going to do

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.279 
pretty much about it so i'm going to do
a<00:04:43.889> lot<00:04:44.039> of<00:04:44.099> research<00:04:44.610> and<00:04:44.900> fill<00:04:45.900> you<00:04:46.080> guys<00:04:46.110> in

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
a lot of research and fill you guys in

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.170 
a lot of research and fill you guys in
but<00:04:46.680> i<00:04:46.740> know<00:04:46.830> about<00:04:47.010> the<00:04:47.250> species<00:04:47.639> as<00:04:47.849> far<00:04:48.060> as

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
but i know about the species as far as

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.879 
but i know about the species as far as
venom<00:04:48.539> is<00:04:48.659> concerned<00:04:49.080> for<00:04:49.289> this<00:04:49.409> one<00:04:49.650> it's

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
venom is concerned for this one it's

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.850 
venom is concerned for this one it's
more<00:04:50.729> or<00:04:50.909> less<00:04:51.030> like<00:04:51.389> your<00:04:51.750> jira<00:04:52.590> Zeya

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
more or less like your jira Zeya

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.100 
more or less like your jira Zeya
apparently<00:04:53.729> they're<00:04:53.909> not<00:04:54.090> very<00:04:54.449> aggressive

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
apparently they're not very aggressive

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.649 
apparently they're not very aggressive
spiders<00:04:55.530> but<00:04:56.400> certainly<00:04:56.940> they<00:04:57.240> are<00:04:57.419> very

00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:57.659 
spiders but certainly they are very

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:02.089 
spiders but certainly they are very
quick<00:04:57.990> and<00:04:59.840> these<00:05:00.840> spiders<00:05:01.260> do<00:05:01.590> actually<00:05:02.070> need

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099 
quick and these spiders do actually need

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:05.240 
quick and these spiders do actually need
to<00:05:02.400> be<00:05:02.520> more<00:05:02.870> fed<00:05:03.870> more<00:05:04.080> often<00:05:04.530> than<00:05:04.770> the

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
to be more fed more often than the

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.820 
to be more fed more often than the

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
be it once a week but judging by its

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.430 
be it once a week but judging by its
growth<00:05:10.919> rate<00:05:11.159> it<00:05:11.940> grows<00:05:12.120> pretty<00:05:12.570> quickly<00:05:12.930> they

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
growth rate it grows pretty quickly they

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.519 
growth rate it grows pretty quickly they
