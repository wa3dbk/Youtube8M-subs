this readable by a PC as well as a Mac
we'll<00:01:41.250> need<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.549> reformat<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.920> way<00:01:44.040> that

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
we'll need to reformat it the way that

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.639 
we'll need to reformat it the way that
this<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.369> done<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:45.030> by<00:01:45.329> selecting<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.259> volume

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
this is done is by selecting the volume

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.929 
this is done is by selecting the volume
and<00:01:48.140> then<00:01:49.140> clicking<00:01:49.380> on<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.710> erase<00:01:50.009> tab

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:54.889 

you'll<00:01:53.939> see<00:01:54.000> there<00:01:54.299> are<00:01:54.420> some<00:01:54.630> instructions

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
you'll see there are some instructions

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.139 
you'll see there are some instructions
given<00:01:58.159> basically<00:01:59.159> you'll<00:01:59.670> want<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.909> pick<00:02:00.119> a

the<00:02:12.770> format<00:02:13.190> that<00:02:13.220> we<00:02:13.550> should<00:02:13.790> use<00:02:14.090> is<00:02:14.360> f80

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
the format that we should use is f80

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.910 
the format that we should use is f80
ms-dos<00:02:16.160> format<00:02:20.290> you'll<00:02:21.290> then<00:02:21.500> need<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.739> pick<00:02:21.890> a

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
ms-dos format you'll then need to pick a
