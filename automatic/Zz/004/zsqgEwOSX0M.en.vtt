00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello girls finally new video e 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.580
 then the hairstyle is re-styled 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.040
 that we're going to make the seed today is 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.190
 really super easy i know you there 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.660
 I say in almost all the hairstyles that 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.570
 we are going to do but this is really 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:24.840
 easy so we're going to create one 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.240
 braid a small braid that will be a 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.449
 fundamentally circles the rest 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.360
 part of the hair will remain loose 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.020
 so what we need for this 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:43.050
 combing a brush to dissolve 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:47.789
 knots a pastry for those who wish 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.840
 have an additional security of fixing 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:56.760
 the braid and tele hairpins therefore 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:01:00.840
 let's start by dividing our own 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:04.170
 hair in a practically two 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.760
 huge strands therefore all the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.680
 remaining part of the hair that we 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:13.189
 we're going to move behind and one 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:18.360
 ciocchetti na small side then 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:22.259
 we comb our hair what it bends and 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:29.930
 we begin to go to make a 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:34.790
 braid then divide into three ed 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.790
 let's start to weave 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.940
 let's make a nice braid wait 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.880
 and we come to the end of ours 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.880
 length 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:08.229
 I decided to start the braid 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:12.380
 from the left side of my left 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:15.200
 because then we 're going to hide 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.450
 precisely the length of the braid la 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.090
 terminal part of the braid for 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.630
 the other part of the hair and then the 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.510
 our greece will make a little circle e 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.580
 let's say that in this way I will 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.330
 camouflages rho a little more than the hairpins 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:35.830
 with the tuft but you can choose 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.830
 the side you like best 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:08.519
 arrived at the end of our 3 ci 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.519
 we close with an elastic eno 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:20.200
 I'm using this white not so much 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:23.050
 really big to show you where 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.420
 I will go then position the braid as 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.910
 I will camouflage it but the ideal is to use 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.190
 of s and p transparent bowed in 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:34.720
 then our braid is finished 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:37.930
 we comb all our hair well 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.950
 back because our braid 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:45.460
 will become the circles know then the 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:50.250
 let's take it vertically 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:53.040
 then towards the other and then the 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:57.940
 we place our head well to it 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:02.950
 arrived near our ear the 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:05.460
 we fasten with hairpins around 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.460
 let you see 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:16.960
 we take the forge and fix our own 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:20.380
 braid we put two take then the 

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:23.080
 hair length and we hide in 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:27.450
 this way our elastic eno 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:36.480
 we comb our hair well 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:40.470
 we arrange our tuft and fly 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.470
 the hairstyle is finished 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:55.850
 as I said it is super super simple e 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:59.300
 easy to make but I would like to make you 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:04.190
 see the wonderful effect that 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:08.690
 you will be able to get then go to 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:10.460
 create a circle made with i 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.690
 your hair then the same 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.730
 tone 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:19.000
 I saw in some store they see 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:21.860
 these three braids and blond bands 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.710
 brunettes but in reality they will never 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.690
 identical to your hair 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:30.950
 in this way we are going to create instead 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:34.280
 a headband strap perfectly 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:38.990
 identical to our effect hair 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:41.770
 so very romantic a little fairy tale but 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:46.850
 which I really like a lot 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:49.760
 so this is the final hairstyle 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:52.280
 let me know if you liked how 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.950
 always if you're going to do it 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.350
 take a picture and tag themes on 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:00.650
 instagram so that i can too 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.780
 see it and all that remains is to greet you e 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.500
 see you at the next video a kiss 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.500
