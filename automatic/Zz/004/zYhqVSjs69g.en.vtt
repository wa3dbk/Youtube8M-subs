Dave a lot of great info and thank you
for<00:00:05.670> that<00:00:05.850> I<00:00:06.270> do<00:00:06.750> have<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.080> question<00:00:07.620> on<00:00:07.770> sag<00:00:08.160> on

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
for that I do have a question on sag on

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.060 
for that I do have a question on sag on
a<00:00:08.940> progressive<00:00:09.269> spring<00:00:10.200> how<00:00:10.679> do<00:00:10.740> you<00:00:10.950> adjust

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
a progressive spring how do you adjust

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.230 
a progressive spring how do you adjust
your<00:00:11.519> numbers<00:00:12.030> for<00:00:12.840> sag<00:00:13.230> or<00:00:13.769> do<00:00:14.309> you<00:00:14.490> set<00:00:14.820> the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
your numbers for sag or do you set the

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.240 
your numbers for sag or do you set the
same<00:00:15.509> numbers<00:00:15.929> as<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.320> would<00:00:16.560> for<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.890> linear

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
same numbers as you would for a linear

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.189 
same numbers as you would for a linear
spring<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:18.000> have<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.560> 2009<00:00:19.560> oh<00:00:20.070> six<00:00:20.810> thanks<00:00:21.810> well

Aaron in regards to progressive Springs
some<00:00:26.340> are<00:00:26.490> incredibly<00:00:27.240> progressive<00:00:28.550> 2009<00:00:29.550> are

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
some are incredibly progressive 2009 are

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.720 
some are incredibly progressive 2009 are
one<00:00:30.240> as<00:00:30.539> an<00:00:30.750> example

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
one as an example

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.090 
one as an example
some<00:00:32.730> are<00:00:33.059> minorly<00:00:34.050> progressive<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:34.950> that

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
some are minorly progressive in that

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.709 
some are minorly progressive in that
it's<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.340> very<00:00:35.370> slight<00:00:35.760> taper<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.360> top<00:00:36.600> of

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
it's a very slight taper to the top of

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.569 
it's a very slight taper to the top of
the<00:00:36.780> spring<00:00:36.960> in<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.230> case<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.680> Euro<00:00:37.860> nine<00:00:38.370> are

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
the spring in the case of Euro nine are

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.530 
the spring in the case of Euro nine are
six<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.750> have<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.469> know<00:00:40.910> how<00:00:41.910> progressive

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
six so you have to know how progressive

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.750 
six so you have to know how progressive
is<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.840> spring<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.950> have<00:00:44.190> installed<00:00:44.550> on

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
is the spring that you have installed on

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.819 
is the spring that you have installed on
your<00:00:44.879> bike<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.750> for<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.140> obviously<00:00:46.350> you

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
your bike and for that obviously you

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.410 
your bike and for that obviously you
need<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.160> take<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.489> spring<00:00:47.730> out<00:00:47.879> put<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.360> a

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
need to take the spring out put it in a

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.270 
need to take the spring out put it in a
spring<00:00:48.690> tester<00:00:49.110> rate<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.860> figure<00:00:50.250> out

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
spring tester rate it and figure out

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.400 
spring tester rate it and figure out
what<00:00:50.820> are<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.090> dealing<00:00:51.360> with<00:00:51.690> per<00:00:51.960> inch<00:00:52.199> of

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
what are you dealing with per inch of

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.830 
what are you dealing with per inch of
travel<00:00:52.820> now<00:00:53.820> obviously<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.329> regards<00:00:54.719> the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
travel now obviously in regards the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.510 
travel now obviously in regards the
owner<00:00:55.050> now<00:00:55.230> six<00:00:55.559> it's<00:00:55.800> nowhere<00:00:55.980> near<00:00:56.129> as

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
owner now six it's nowhere near as

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.959 
owner now six it's nowhere near as
progressive<00:00:57.210> as<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.510> o9r<00:00:57.870> one<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:59.489> regards

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
progressive as the o9r one so in regards

progressive as the o9r one so in regards
to<00:01:00.059> your<00:01:00.210> specific<00:01:00.960> question<00:01:01.489> go<00:01:02.489> ahead<00:01:02.730> and

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
to your specific question go ahead and

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.609 
to your specific question go ahead and
set<00:01:03.090> say<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.359> guess<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.750> would<00:01:03.930> for<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> linear

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
set say I guess you would for a linear

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.399 
set say I guess you would for a linear
spring<00:01:05.040> on<00:01:05.909> other<00:01:06.450> bikes<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.930> don't<00:01:06.990> have

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
spring on other bikes that don't have

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.190 
spring on other bikes that don't have
that<00:01:08.210> simply<00:01:09.210> because<00:01:09.360> you'll<00:01:09.780> find<00:01:10.020> with<00:01:10.170> a

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
that simply because you'll find with a

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.350 
that simply because you'll find with a
very<00:01:10.409> progressive<00:01:10.680> spring<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.549> static<00:01:12.090> sag

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
very progressive spring the static sag

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.890 
very progressive spring the static sag
or<00:01:12.950> the<00:01:13.950> amount<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.400> sag<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.970> bike<00:01:15.210> collapses

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
or the amount of sag the bike collapses

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.570 
or the amount of sag the bike collapses
under<00:01:16.080> its<00:01:16.170> own<00:01:16.439> weight<00:01:16.500> from<00:01:16.920> full<00:01:17.189> extension

under its own weight from full extension
if<00:01:18.119> it's<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.960> lot<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.830> will<00:01:20.009> give<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.310> two

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
if it's a lot that will give you two

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.249 
if it's a lot that will give you two
clues<00:01:20.790> one<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.479> top-hat<00:01:21.810> spring<00:01:22.140> is

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
clues one that the top-hat spring is

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.679 
clues one that the top-hat spring is
very<00:01:22.290> long<00:01:22.710> or<00:01:23.009> two<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.820> spring<00:01:24.509> you

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
very long or two that the spring you

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.679 
very long or two that the spring you
have<00:01:24.720> either<00:01:25.350> fork<00:01:25.740> or<00:01:26.009> shock<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.700> very

if you have a bike with a huge static
sag<00:01:35.549> number<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.780> need<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.020> fix<00:01:37.259> it

sag number you need to fix it

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.100 
sag number you need to fix it
you<00:01:38.369> can<00:01:38.549> band-aid<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.450> add<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> bunch<00:01:39.990> of

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
you can band-aid it and add a bunch of

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.710 
you can band-aid it and add a bunch of
sagging<00:01:40.500> compression<00:01:41.009> damping<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:42.000> keep<00:01:42.570> the

hopefully<00:01:45.210> but<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.740> end<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.189> really<00:01:47.430> need

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
hopefully but in the end you really need

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.120 
hopefully but in the end you really need
to<00:01:47.850> take<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.240> spring<00:01:48.540> out

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
to take that spring out

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.389 
to take that spring out
unless<00:01:50.479> you<00:01:51.479> are<00:01:51.659> basically<00:01:52.649> just<00:01:52.740> commuting

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
progressive spring will give you a lot

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
are going into a twisty section then you

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.880 
are going into a twisty section then you
were<00:03:07.660> going<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:07.900> ride<00:03:08.080> moderately<00:03:08.650> through

were going to ride moderately through
that<00:03:09.070> twisty<00:03:09.430> section<00:03:09.880> so<00:03:10.570> the<00:03:10.660> basic<00:03:11.140> premise

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
that twisty section so the basic premise

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.420 
that twisty section so the basic premise
there<00:03:12.160> is<00:03:12.310> comfort<00:03:12.959> over<00:03:13.959> tours<00:03:14.680> chassis

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
there is comfort over tours chassis

settings to handle aggressive cornering

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.790 
settings to handle aggressive cornering
etc<00:03:18.820> so<00:03:19.080> hopefully<00:03:20.080> that<00:03:20.260> answered<00:03:20.769> your
