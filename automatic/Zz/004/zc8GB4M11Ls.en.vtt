a<00:00:22.990> world<00:00:23.350> of<00:00:23.470> difference<00:00:23.529> to<00:00:23.920> me<00:00:24.160> I<00:00:24.880> used<00:00:25.510> to

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
a world of difference to me I used to

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.620 
a world of difference to me I used to
have<00:00:26.050> basically<00:00:26.800> this<00:00:27.040> tool<00:00:27.369> vita<00:00:28.150> che<00:00:28.180> tab

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
have basically this tool vita che tab

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.400 
have basically this tool vita che tab
and<00:00:28.900> it<00:00:29.050> has<00:00:29.230> 16<00:00:29.830> shades<00:00:30.700> that<00:00:31.300> I<00:00:31.480> would<00:00:31.810> use<00:00:32.080> to

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
and it has 16 shades that I would use to

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.660 
and it has 16 shades that I would use to
help<00:00:33.400> describe<00:00:33.820> to<00:00:34.120> the<00:00:34.240> lab<00:00:34.920> what<00:00:35.920> I<00:00:35.950> needed<00:00:36.310> I

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
help describe to the lab what I needed I

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.520 
help describe to the lab what I needed I
would<00:00:37.060> get<00:00:37.240> very<00:00:37.270> good<00:00:37.720> shading<00:00:38.170> and<00:00:38.320> very

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
would get very good shading and very

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.940 
would get very good shading and very
good<00:00:38.740> work<00:00:39.010> but<00:00:39.760> it<00:00:40.420> wasn't<00:00:40.840> the<00:00:40.900> custom<00:00:41.560> shade

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
good work but it wasn't the custom shade

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.130 
good work but it wasn't the custom shade
it<00:00:42.130> wasn't<00:00:42.520> it<00:00:43.060> didn't<00:00:43.390> look<00:00:43.540> that<00:00:43.600> mean<00:00:44.110> that

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
it wasn't it didn't look that mean that

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.970 
it wasn't it didn't look that mean that
natural<00:00:44.950> look<00:00:45.220> that<00:00:45.750> teeth<00:00:46.750> have<00:00:47.079> so<00:00:47.590> Luke<00:00:47.800> has

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
natural look that teeth have so Luke has

to<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.510> lab<00:02:01.690> is<00:02:02.290> priceless<00:02:02.740> it's<00:02:03.700> less<00:02:03.970> time

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
to the lab is priceless it's less time

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.240 
to the lab is priceless it's less time
that<00:02:04.660> I<00:02:04.720> have<00:02:04.930> to<00:02:05.050> take<00:02:05.229> in<00:02:05.380> my<00:02:05.500> practice<00:02:05.710> it's

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
that I have to take in my practice it's

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.890 
that I have to take in my practice it's
less<00:02:06.490> time<00:02:06.760> that<00:02:06.970> patient<00:02:07.360> that<00:02:07.479> has<00:02:07.600> to<00:02:07.720> have
