00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 and hello to all dear friends with you 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.000
 train and welcome to my 200 videos 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.240
 on the channel and today purely for 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.490
 diversity I decided to try to play 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.830
 hide and seek on the server hive mc and will be in 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.630
 description come try to play on 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.000
 i actually went to this server it seems 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.410
 second or third time and just even 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.590
 I can not assume that there should be 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.600
 but still try to play here 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.310
 written to the wolves of all one is always all 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.220
 still this hide and seek I was not mistaken very much 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.920
 a chore here everything is done incomprehensibly 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.380
 somehow she just like that work so 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.290
 just will randomly do everything 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.030
 click on all that is possible and in fact than 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.780
 you should work in general we will 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.520
 learn to play hide and seek on this server 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.750
 write comments like what to do if 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.440
 what will I read 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.629
 can find fix interesting and someone 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.100
 learn something new who will be too 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.140
 read the comments along with me but in 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.469
 Generally what I see there is someone 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.390
 vote some here see 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:10.830
 minutes of some kind and they vote 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:14.780
 and here is the 5th hotel we will try the sick 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.850
 Russian countries are so very dark 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.369
 so I do not see a damn letter to describe 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:26.450
 in which eyes literally still can not 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.630
 so here is 5 let china be okay 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.259
 everything 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:35.250
 From now on, only shoot in the light and well, not 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.689
 the gist of how we started playing and who I am so 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.079
 apparently I'm from this country 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.460
 pieces of wood need to hide somewhere 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.229
 the most mean that it is insulting that it is necessary 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:49.439
 stand just written one place like 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:51.299
 would not fucking doing so are 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.920
 they say that I make myself 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.439
 by some thing that's what you did 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.600
 myself was a piece of wood and I and in this 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.360
 the moment I could have imagined and can 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.800
 where do i need to go up 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:09.550
 well, horror 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:11.490
 this day like me looking for oh oh oh oh oh 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:17.910
 oh hurt 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:19.180
 where to go where to go and here also not 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.150
 have provided 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:28.510
 there someone in my beat or I do not know 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:31.320
 designations of these sounds here there is no place like 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:35.620
 bear yourself do no death is near 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:41.650
 okay this is all played enough that I am so 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:43.450
 I understand produces something not what to expect here 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.260
 terrible font i can't make it out 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:51.700
 written and okay 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.290
 why am I now looking for their legs but this is already 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.320
 it will be more interesting than just 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.750
 run for the block though you know for the block too 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.100
 pretty fun, I remember once 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.810
 who played the fence on some other map 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.810
 in my opinion, too, is of wood as if 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.400
 I want highlighted when it is clear so here 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.080
 I used to be too 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.540
 a piece of wood and hid pretty 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.750
 okay on some closet what's going on 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:24.160
 through the mountain 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:27.340
 I want to go out ok 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.709
 and I pretty cool hid that 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.050
 nobody could find me tormented 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.790
 suffered and did not find here I did not even 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.060
 I know what blocks you can turn into 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.239
 to go 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:43.000
 to find someone 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.350
 so this and this type of card is limited here 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.380
 these invisible things 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.300
 I've already seen this in person 1 he 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.650
 showed how to make such invisible 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.230
 walls on ordinary maps 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.670
 who will not say that we run in 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.170
 mostly stupid about the hotel 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.790
 ok understand, understand, I'll know how the pancake 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:06.010
 here at least one killer 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:07.360
 it still needs me idea since we 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.540
 were wooden we will search 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.010
 But if the piece of wood between the chairs we 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.010
 find the way 1 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:18.440
 then it will be possible to beat someone like that 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:23.780
 I also want to build something to bring down someone died 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:26.240
 you are something like a scene so well damn well 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:30.010
 not very interesting not at least 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:33.380
 interesting I want to be fun 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.540
 probably all because I shoot 1 so 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.430
 I am accustomed to for some reason I do not really 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.770
 I want to shoot someone with someone 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.530
 in the team with him to write I do not know what 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.840
 beyond the traits for such a country 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:47.360
 that's why I do not want to crush me too by the way 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.790
 Wild I can not understand because well 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.550
 probably with friends more interesting how 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.139
 you can have fun talking there 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:58.220
 you need to laugh at sometime 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:02.120
 try to strain the county of your friends 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.600
 familiar with them to play few play 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.750
 Michael 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:09.250
 I remember once upon a time when I just started 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.180
 let's say gaining some popularity 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.460
 classmates and everyone else 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.290
 shouting let's shoot letpley so on 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.090
 we shot the cycle and therefore threw in 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:20.539
 As a result, maps and general 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.610
 we will not get a full kapets 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:26.570
 interest because it's gagging 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:28.130
 then you see here and here 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.890
 lick it very difficult on the very 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.830
 It's not that easy to pour 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.930
 zaicking in fact you are sitting there 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.120
 almost every word should catch 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:41.840
 to impose countries 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:44.060
 cuts of sound or a little bit is not convenient for me 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.120
 Well, you have to do it as if 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:49.700
 that people like to complain that no mother 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.979
 countries video you it does not go to you not 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.590
 I have to do this, but I like it 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:58.100
 so want i used to freedom democracy 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:02.560
 the words of the guys are such a thing but we are all up to 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.560
 so far prime cheholchik let loose 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.380
 Well, I don't know what should happen when 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:11.840
 to you here 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:14.360
 and so you need to look for a place where it was possible 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.060
 would somehow climb well here clearly him 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.710
 were cutting here snow can be turned 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.400
 for some reason it seems to me that snow can 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:26.510
 turn for some reason it seems to me that 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:28.720
 should someone be here why sound 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:35.660
 fire in the water is not 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:38.110
 unusual for me personally, well, not here 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.220
 it seems absolutely nobody 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:44.440
 lamp nobody could turn here 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:46.700
 wood need to include bai lin 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.160
 but you do something is not the topic of my crap 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:54.530
 Is it true to me as stylish 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:56.690
 like someone hiding but no here 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:59.150
 think sitting sit sit knock 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:01.310
 some blocks and right beside this asshole 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:05.990
 sits plays look dude he 's not some 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:07.850
 fell can't hit me yes i'm not that 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.490
 one won somebody won something i don't 

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:12.200
 understand 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:16.280
 more clearly is 

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:19.460
 played enough dreamed of cay 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:23.960
 it was strange as if I didn’t know 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:26.540
 you can play but damn how are you straight at all 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.640
 without mood it turns out well 

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.370
 okay i will try still later 

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.970
 record a couple of episodes if you like it 

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:36.200
 Like and of course I do not know there 

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:38.570
 comments write what and how I will 

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:41.630
 read learn but for now we are with you 

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:44.450
 say goodbye it was 200 new mini videos 

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:47.330
 the game will go about us playlist of mini games and 

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:48.110
 there you can find other mini games on 

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.880
 other servers 

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:52.730
 autonomy on another server played this 

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.830
 I do not really like the hold well not 

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:57.860
 the essence is, in general, everything is good, everyone is happy 

00:07:54.830 --> 00:08:01.540
 and the video came up meet dear friends with 

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.540
