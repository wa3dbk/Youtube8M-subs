00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.400
 Talk to me, to the club, I am. 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.080
 patrick blanco and today I'll show you 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.170
 How to play the simplified version 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:27.810
 Frejat 's first secrets music 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.810
 part has three major chords only 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.760
 human dock 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.930
 the economy with easy low is afraid 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:47.750
 The first part stays like this. 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.750
 a love that I have not yet found 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.570
 different that everyone wanted 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:02.670
 in your eyes you want to find a reason 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:06.199
 to live and the wounds in this life I 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.199
 I want to forget 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.880
 the rhythm of the whole song will be the 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.170
 same thing I'll play the slow rhythm and 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.170
 then show me how 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.920
 we're going to split the rhythm into three parts 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.920
 in the first part of the work 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.380
 the second track two up one 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:40.250
 low 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:44.750
 in the third part one down as for 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:47.560
 up and down up in sequence 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.560
 it will stay like this 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.460
 the major sun and colono chords 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.260
 We're going to play the whole rhythm, but in 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.010
 second time we focus the chord only 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.660
 bigger 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:05.580
 we'll focus only on the first part 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:10.160
 and do not wake up with low on F 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.160
 the second and third parts 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.950
 I'll play the whole sequence now. 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:42.520
 the pre-ready in three minor chords with 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:49.880
 seventh largest 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:56.210
 and the column pointed out that this can be 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:03:01.450
 that I have a movie line in a 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.450
 corner or on a bar table 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.930
 the chorus has seven major chords 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:17.800
 the economy with low C - sharp in F 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.800
 with canvas 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.060
 the seventh minucom 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.940
 is greater only with low if 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.189
 in there minor with seventh 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:44.050
 the rhythm is the same and the refrain is like this 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.050
 find a love that is good for me 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.660
 I'm going to search, I'm going to the end. 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:04:01.590
 and hiring her well so she does not have 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:04.069
 afraid when you talk, meet my 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.069
 secrets 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:10.519
