00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:11.719
 for them 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.719
 everybody

 his part and on the other hand the parliament 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.440
 both senses technical perfection 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.160
 it is 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.340
 to be able to work in only 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.170
 murugan 'chaiman' of citi more all things perfection the group 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.020
 so it's true that it's super complicity bust to do this job 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.890
 a season 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.430
 actions very well that's true ted retro couple's friends and in addition 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.950
 om 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.950
 they are together in positions 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.670
 still 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.670
 see report 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.580
 Why 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.580
 the club had 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.080
 I agree with you 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.410
 drums 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.830
 balance sheet m 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.730
 10 one evening two researchers 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.980
 it is unfortunately unavoidable in a situation it is valid 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.440
 the best way 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.440
 Ben listening correcting functions 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.510
 let's move on it's really a research work the lesson 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.510
 but it's a good job 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.489
 what is important is that m 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.659
 we have the sound of the violin 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:13.659
 speed of execution 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:26.409
 indeed 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.549
 anticipation 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.579
 faye 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.909
 So this is it 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.909
 2 there are plenty of surprises 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:44.249
 I exaggerate 

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:46.349
 he has then he is stronger 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.349
 it's terrible what saves 

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:55.379
 we see the lesson 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.729
 the speed of execution that loses 

00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:00.549
 it's not a lot that make no sense 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.259
 gloves 

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:03.819
 if that road 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.659
 nor after the sanction or individual lessons 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:09.649
 so it's going very fast it's a job 

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:11.699
 psychologically speaking 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:13.739
 because montebourg 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.739
 I am happy with reflection and anticipation 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.069
 of playing the gdp of the fight
