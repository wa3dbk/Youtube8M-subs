00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.520
 moscow stora 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.250
 I was told 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.920
 frankly worried not bad 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.689
 and well liked the new characters 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.980
 but I find that the animations are 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.540
 rather not bad and well actually 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.329
 it is good but it can look like 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.540
 gods to others naruto who had a good 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.350
 it does not change too much generation it is 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.899
 well 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.239
 good the sequences are very it's 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.079
 very responsive always at the level of 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.940
 furies are still so beautiful 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.789
 it's a good game that always stays 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.059
 in the lineage of the second generation and 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.649
 human animation is very fluid very 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.299
 nervous me I like what better 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.640
 dimension compared to other games 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:05.399
 video that can be found on console a 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.259
 best 3d most beautiful image very low 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:09.690
 I find it a nice game especially between 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.830
 kind of friends in the evenings or night is 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.390
 nice you can play several 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.520
 frankly and more it is nice to play 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.869
 there is not much time to play there 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.140
 not complicated stuff it's simple to 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.819
 to play 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.819
 and frankly that we do it well 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.740
 yes, how I played at the old one 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.450
 does this one there are new ones 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.100
 characters but hey there are some 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.270
 little stuff cited as for example one 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.100
 can go into waking mode all of 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.659
 after that it was a bit of shit and because 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.729
 that he can become super strong from the beginning 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.510
 and but otherwise it's not bad but we did not 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.320
 not all seen in fact 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.060
 after good for me I do not like them 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.460
 concatenations that is to say the 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.880
 combo bricks that make you can not 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.380
 do a lot of things we took in 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.490
 but otherwise it's still a good big game 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.320
 I advise fans 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.330
 I personally am not too much of my 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.460
 commitment guy but I think for 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.750
 start it's a good game frankly 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.130
 to put it is cool for example 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.160
 one of the new characters that is 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.790
 whether they be the price of the series 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.970
 who continues 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.890
 there are new techniques there by 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.450
 example of the new maps and a new 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.750
 story mode and new fashion in 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.640
 line 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.520
 yeah that's not bad after we do not 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.990
 do not know we did not see the countryside but 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.760
 yeah otherwise for now it's not bad 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.500
 and the problem is that it's actually 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.910
 level of anime not scans actually 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.840
 the game is all that is to say that he has 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:35.660
 a little late on the ace the real naruto 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:37.129
 the importer is too short the base 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.800
 yeah I like reading it's a big fan 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:41.930
 I'm not christmas I'm not a fan fan 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.590
 Benjamin Boyet I really like this cognac 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.590
 and six bikes there makes his big mangaka and 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.340
 I am the lineage of the manga too 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.010
 frankly i have nothing to say 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.080
 for example at -30 or for 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.849
 turn into awake mode we no longer 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.260
 need to have life on the brink of 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.610
 die he wants what remains before 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.370
 to die now we can make an air 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.879
 cold effect her left 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:09.519
 and at this game he picks up exactly naruto 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:13.200
 in fact they had been convinced you 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.400
 think cowardice or not me yeah I think 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.370
 here I do not know but the Sherpas 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:21.390
 for the game and why not me I'm going 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.640
 buy it for sure you 'll let go yeah 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.170
 me for sure 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.050
 not convinced his eyes is bomb 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:32.770
 frankly have to buy it 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:36.380
 I am all ears 2 I speak from 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:39.070
 generation I do not like it too much but 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.070
 he is purchasable
