00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 hello here and I hope you go 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.560
 well so I know I'm dressed like 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.420
 in the last video since this is the 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.370
 same day the same time I come back with 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.880
 my favorites of the month of December start 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.679
 January 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.389
 I believe that fabris is really the 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.130
 videos with the treats says I 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.000
 prefer to sign but I like you too much 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.170
 show my little favorites 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.090
 there are things that I received 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.560
 a free game created 6.2 otherwise in 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.500
 comments it will go in battle 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.760
 so that's it changes nothing if I you 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.680
 favorite is that it's really 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.880
 my favorites I have not been paid for 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.990
 to make these videos I speak to you if 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.900
 jacques although I do not speak so 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.430
 I do not like and here we start with 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.960
 what is beauty with a grout for 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.160
 the hair I found this product in 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.210
 the wine expenses especially by chance 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.610
 here I was more after shampoo 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.260
 so I staked it out and it turned out 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.040
 that it's superhuman so I think 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.270
 that she bought it in supermarkets 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.430
 for a few euros 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.340
 brand test dove solution 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.070
 repair intensive care minutes for 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.510
 keep the color vibrant 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.530
 for ten weeks do not use 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.010
 really what I wanted to take care of 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.110
 of my color 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.270
 but because it's really damn 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.070
 grilling the hair that makes them all 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.230
 sweet edml is a crazy thing 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.000
 you asked me in my old video I 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.040
 believe what I was doing my hair that 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.420
 you had to make this mask there so 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.439
 it's a care in six minutes so they 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.880
 say normally let him have a 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.000
 minute me I hope minutes because 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.220
 otherwise I do not really believe it but that's it 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.530
 I leave it a little laid and really 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.229
 makes hair very soft while silky 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.250
 and frankly it's really good and 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.020
 it's mostly because after a great 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.420
 surface I'm going to show you that I 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.530
 wanted to show you because that's it 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.570
 really cheap and that makes you 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.150
 all beautiful hair next level 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.950
 make-up so I did not change anything special 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.909
 in my make-up cheese routine 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.500
 still all the same 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.329
 however, it is a discovery and the 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.070
 brand knicks 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.259
 so I have them knicks products but 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.090
 in addition I was a danic evening this game 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.920
 that's what you saw in the blocks 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.930
 from the east for example we could see the 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.820
 single night it was great fun and 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.140
 in fact I was able to discover little ones 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.500
 products including products for 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.200
 lips 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.000
 and that I really liked the buzzers blocks 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.219
 so that's the gloss she had a great 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.170
 test the goff jeans but never but there 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.450
 it's colors and so that's it 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.860
 super fear it's violating if you 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.810
 do not hurt it's in this color 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.759
 there that comes out but it's really pretty 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.659
 it was just for you to show them 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.680
 because it's products that do not 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.500
 really cheap and that's 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.030
 really soup she bedridden no 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.230
 but little favorites to turn it off 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.239
 this act 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.159
 amboise and ground cherry pie too 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.299
 cute so here it is small 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.400
 globes that are not at all tacky 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.560
 just they are a little sticky level 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.970
 hair g berne lose with my 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.459
 buddy I carried it all the time 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.019
 whore we hear the wind there that makes 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.879
 take off was too boring but this 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.370
 is the colors are super game a 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.830
 other favorite is the jumbo that you 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.290
 must surely know him that's who 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.000
 hear mocha and adjust to any 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.129
 the mobile eyelid when we are lazy 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.159
 to make up other products make up 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.840
 that I loved this month it's the 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:47.010
 antibes the loony solution of checks 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.049
 clinic so it's a foundation 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.610
 whole liquid perfection me I use 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.200
 not for its function against imperfections 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.569
 because I do not have buttons but it's 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.420
 just I do not know that stuff I think 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.180
 you've also heard good 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:03.239
 it is pretty archi that really makes you 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.799
 a skin of for a bit of bba 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.390
 if you have buttons that can 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.629
 stamps have in this case you advance 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.739
 to unify the complexion so I do not think so 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.359
 we can really consider that 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.920
 like beauty but it's a trick 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.450
 that I bought at the occitane so 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.519
 this part is a little chelou that 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.919
 is called a relaxing pillow mist 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.290
 in fact it's a blow spray before 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:24.780
 to sleep you leave all around your 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.370
 customers and so you sleep it feels too much 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.049
 good and I find that his really relaxes 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.790
 I showed you that you talk about it 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:34.380
 because it's really a favorite 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.150
 I love stuff like this smells 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.310
 super good and I love the principle 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.049
 that's really relaxing before 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.700
 sleep like that i have not if you are from 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.049
 nature a little stressed or what and years and 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.569
 always adherent vote is always 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.060
 weird there who will take the cabbage to z 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.459
 to really relax before sleeping 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.169
 they come a lot here it's a 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.900
 brown pillows and actually it smells a 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:58.470
 it feels a little orange blossom 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.480
 so you have to love and that without joining all 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.069
 at 16.90 I think that in Occitan 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.400
 but you really have it for super 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.930
 long time 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.870
 so that's then fashion category 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.940
 now so I have two pairs of 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.949
 cushioned shoes to the elder had it 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.840
 hear talk on youtube site fashion 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:18.329
 recent rest contacted me a month ago 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.160
 and I was quite skeptical about the fact 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.979
 to receive shoes from home 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.110
 because I was a little afraid of the 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.280
 quality you have it here you are and 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.479
 frankly I was bad hands 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.469
 because I'm delighted so here they are 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.630
 have done a lot of partnerships with 

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:35.460
 youtube zeitoun and actually it's okay 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.780
 really really good and I think 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.070
 that it clear my shoes which 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.990
 the age and two pairs of shoes hit 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.640
 of heart this month and it's words 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.250
 dress up because here I love him all 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.770
 time the first ones are like that so 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.780
 it's simple black ankle boots 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.159
 that we can see quite often but 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.110
 frankly it's great with jeans 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:53.760
 are great and especially the quality 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.979
 is really of a kind that is really 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.229
 hyper rigid frankly that's the 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.960
 week with a hyper the shot me I them 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.610
 adore on the other hand at a level of the 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.490
 cut 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:08.039
 I'm doing 38 and their 38 is a bit 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.900
 great the troop and the second are a 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:14.849
 little more mastoc they are like that so 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.560
 you have a strap with gold and 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:19.139
 Here are some pretty boots 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.750
 super well cut finished my kids I 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.520
 been surprised and I do not regret the 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.289
 partnership because I found myself 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.130
 shoes really too super hot 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:31.560
 simple to wear now in the 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.219
 random category so little boxing you 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.750
 must know 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:35.669
 that's what they do the small poles has 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.889
 make a buzz have their little paul to 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.300
 hang somewhere redemption is 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:41.370
 in my favorites I'm going to put some 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.039
 something we can talk about on youtube 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:47.729
 it's their picture frame so of course I 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:49.169
 was not there that's so hand on 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:50.370
 the shoulder invites like that they are great 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:52.349
 well but you know the principle 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.539
 but on the other hand something new in fact 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:56.969
 I made my darling for decor 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:06:00.599
 a little his paladin apartment in paris to 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:02.250
 paris a big photo frame in boxing I 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:05.250
 will put a picture of what it makes 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.050
 and it's too beautiful , basically it's a 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.120
 great frame that you can do 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.900
 frame by little boxing in black and white 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:15.350
 that you want and in fact there are 30 35 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.600
 pictures in the cable and that's really 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.340
 great and it's a great deco idea if 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.570
 you're really looking for a frame it's a 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.400
 chart in fact that you hang there are 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.200
 all your photos 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.550
 I always find a little in the house 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:29.030
 its terraces and candles 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.950
 know I do not like yankees 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.840
 kandal at the base but there all the month of 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.640
 December my mom she burned her 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:37.040
 two candles there for Christmas and serah we have 

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.110
 got right all the time to his two 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.500
 candles and so I'm completely 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.940
 fan 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.650
 that's why I really like it 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.230
 that they kandel because I had a 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.810
 big candle christmas cookies you 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:50.630
 have there a little yellow that is taste of 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.490
 Christmas cakes and it disgusts me this 

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.960
 smell just finally finally I find 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.100
 that the exodus directs that they are very 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.040
 quickly disgusting 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.180
 he distinguished himself there all las little ago 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.880
 so get away with that I really like 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.620
 will show you to say that it smells 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:07.310
 but it's not at all and so does 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.820
 here is the frosted apple and chris 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.710
 harmful 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.270
 so that's in the festive category 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.130
 and the food and spice 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.690
 so here it is small ball museums 

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.570
 rolled it almost in the infinite 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.530
 these are my two favorite candles 

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.910
 ten months ago at the center preferring 

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.980
 heathland that because I would like to 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:25.340
 to move ballin in my room but 

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.780
 I'm too scared that it feels too much top box 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.790
 and all my little favorites of the moment 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.840
 tell me what are your favorites and 

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.850
 what video you would like to have 

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.010
 soon on my channel I was hoping 

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:37.660
 to execute me I really do you my 

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.660
 big kisses and I tell you after 8
