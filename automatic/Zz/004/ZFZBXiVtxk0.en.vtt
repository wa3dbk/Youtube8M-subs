 world 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.149
 the emperor not the enterprise Barbarossa that comes then later » 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.160
 Last time, talk about Ballack 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.160
 Nadal can except 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.110
 Henry the fleet did you see that was cool before Pope Gregory 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.030
 the six that carried snow so well with data centers was courtesy 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.540
 Lammert known 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.840
 the snow masses on Jogi and so it was the 11 am on Sunday but besides 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.500
 eight 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.520
 then a more or less in the 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.920
 because I forgot something Peter Stocker was all very well here that welcomes 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.159
 learn what is unreal a washing machine a globe a dice a question whether 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:20.310
 Veh is supposed to be on the band 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.050
 the 4th 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.330
 he was 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.420
 in Grohnde 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.810
 The summary of the last ten 15 years can be said and that 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.090
 Professor Voters tells our company he is actually in 3 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.330
 how should one say to see spending spree 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.030
 Tourism mass tourism 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.330
 And it was also plumper in time than basically terrorists with percent 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.450
 flown 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.440
 and that as a fan and I can do it myself 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.330
 Of course, he is the terrorist 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.320
 Business leads 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.820
 since this gloss 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.759
 drive the groomed slopes 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.120
 so these will be clarified for Fuerteventura September and 4 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.610
 Percent the fun society 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.929
 the leisure society percent 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.240
 Protesters again Elton John or I believe that he has never been with me 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:08.379
 happens 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:12.239
 I saw Elton John on Sunday in 3sat before 10 o'clock 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.099
 after which Norman team gold arrives at their shows Pino catered to them 

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:20.289
 Neumann like so many competitors 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:22.640
 Pauli switched on so complained 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.679
 all this here the stock market 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:26.130
 Schlecker, that is 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.430
 Even then, they gladly did not pay anything they simply pay for everything 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.149
 secretly 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:32.239
 including store 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.229
 Now comes a very central term from Professor Voter Dr 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:40.889
 Oliver Rocher or as he is called international conferences Olivier Dubois ste 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:42.269
 insane 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.540
 What fascinated us was the so-called elevator effect that is why there was 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.999
 actually never more quiet zones why have just that 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:53.670
 somehow she did not want to have any money or little money 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.140
 now he is attacking the man of revolution by the way 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.349
 said elevator effect Iran's him on the show business times 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:05.639
 Simplified at the top were now presented by Thomas 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:07.989
 Gottschalk and Johannes b Kerner 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.989
 Middle class percent by both of us both Dr 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.199
 the lower class by private television if now simply Markus Lanz as 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:27.749
 Example taken Red 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.320
 but the FCA managed from this underclass 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.509
 come out and put to ZDF to the federal government 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:36.509
 horny the so-called elevator means 11 way 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:40.960
 Also the after or middle income have basically 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.480
 when there was still 10 12 percent salary increase always a bit 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.299
 benefits 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.299
 and, so to speak, in the elevator maybe did not go all the way up 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:52.569
 but always a bit with that he is now 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:54.569
 past 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.199
 and now it could happen that so to speak the class society 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:00.919
 Oil comes back extremely because it's all the way but that he keeps coming back 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.109
 Percent renewed percent 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.109
 and that's why it's so important that the classes are internal 

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:10.209
 it basically works 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.479
 different classes that always stay the same, says Meyer 

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:18.139
 The office can be based on whether the act in the now published dictatorship of 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:19.099
 something is 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:20.479
 in the upswing 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.830
 one always sticks to titles measured by the known price per year 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.080
 Wedding of the photographers 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.699
 then it is not the Bush political system 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.659
 Galen's hair left a little raining down 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:33.229
 the nobility that they are socially through 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:36.340
 why is he a piece of Hohenems yes 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.380
 with Bamba golden spoon in the mouth at least show you delicious candidate the 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.689
 hiking season 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:44.460
 so that means 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.150
 Percent of the shares 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.740
 it's about the people down there who always stay in the middle class 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.410
 you can take turns mutually turn the turnip work on top 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.950
 And at the bottom is not that much, that's why we have here too 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.720
 so to speak the efficiency that it so shaking department at the chancellery 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.229
 I want to get in here 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.259
 it is isolated 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:09.730
 some exceptions figure but on the whole it is just like that 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.970
 Percent, for example, the lawyers and the tips of the files or 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.319
 even the military in the door we see here 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:18.439
 the bankruptcy 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:20.800
 the same that is called percent 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.819
 It gets a bit over a few pages with percentages very much 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:27.300
 36 percent of top officials complicate the 76 percent of judges on 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.410
 Higher Regional Court Celle 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.180
 Already have 19% space Gera the depth to four percent already at nine at the beginning 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.050

 the Sat 1 of 7 percent of all percent years these jobs cancel few 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.809
 The Tutsi did not confirm that much 

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:42.309
 very important he is 

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:45.269
 the time was one that mediated the story temporarily completed 

00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:46.909
 with German unity 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:50.530
 that's right Hubert was a percent because yes, the program has virtually eye 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:52.969
 Lonsert 90 that was the time 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:54.879
 happiest day in our lives 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:58.180
 Percent than then practically the wall percent if that is always in life and 

00:05:58.179 --> 00:06:03.169
 every moment whoever had experienced it and to that he was practically Tandy 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:07.030
 Reunion and reunification Diaz great highlight was practically then 

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:11.050
 Even at the Brandenburg Gate then still solved about the Scorpions were practical 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.590
 who also intervened from the spot percent to reunification 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.510
 Formally, the walking aids at the Seerhein and the weather course are shares of the Turbon 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.230

 further central letter of the Habitus that means the brothers sisters out 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:27.030
 The East Percent Furniture is of clothing by language 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.450
 Bullocks are similar to, for example, when you represent the 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:33.449
 Capitalists in general, that is to say 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:38.259
 once Doc in everyday life yes he knows the clothes he knows 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:41.599
 a language he knows himself at the booths of the idea together on the same 

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:42.020
 schools 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.770
 then they could stand as normal end they wanted there they would never be 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.110
 This is essentially only slightly simplified 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.150
 the content of the fifth volume percent of German social history 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.780
 highly recommended by hans-ulrich Wehler but the story goes

 his cabinet presented, among other things, the successor to him in Berlin 

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:05.649
 as Minister of Agriculture Ehlen Ilse Aigner 

00:07:05.649 --> 00:07:08.819
 he was lucky and and there today and we say goodbye a bit of 

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:12.019
 Sfars have become popular with Bavarian politicians in recent years 

00:07:12.019 --> 00:07:14.879
 but have grown to the heart 

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:15.900
 backbenchers 

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.900
 Rank Germany Nobel Prizes 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.520
