00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.900
 I thought more about the start, we do our best 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:14.919
 everything can be done 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:18.060
 with the do it yourself says 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.280
 however, this goes 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.320
 in this type of people 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.480
 the busy 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.839
 in the meantime it has been going a few times as much as possible 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:28.839
 it is also the end station 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.330
 the frost 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
 mountain camp open love 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.360
 becomes sport 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.770
 being the small respect 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.100
 the demand for the two major work 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.140
 the balloon won it's actually it will be through 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.020
 for the 80 on the DVD 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.660
 sneak off 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.060
 take over again 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.380
 according to the planning office 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.600
 after the club 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.280
 lead the use 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.280
 professional makeover 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.220
 but certainly not 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.220
 in the city of amstetten 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.470
 anti rust middle finger and there I am going to try that must of course 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.060
 so also show winning 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.610
 set a large group of poele 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.250
 we will succeed so quickly 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.400
 the plums and is locked up 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.410
 we still have a lot to do is that 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:13.809
 we are now leaving three no balls 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:16.129
 the sixth time 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.239
 at the apex 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.239
 is still under contract 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:26.319
 for being in the air 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.319
 that's why we want to prevent 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.099
 employers 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.109
 in this possibly good again 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:42.840
