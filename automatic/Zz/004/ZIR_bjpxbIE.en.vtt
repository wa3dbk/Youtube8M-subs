 direct world of the front arm and then my 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.530
 direct from the back arm online weight 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.050
 from the body 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.220
 I pass it backwards okay I 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.870
 then you are on my foot 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.839
 to come and touch with my foot and down 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.820
 of the front leg as soon as it's done 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:52.760
 after touching I control my gesture 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.090
 agree to come and pass my support 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.489
 behind I see the target I put a 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.140
 reverse lapel turning boxing savate 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.809
 French is a combat sport 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.059
 a sport of opposition with 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.520
 percussion at the level of the techniques of 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.520
 fist as well as foot techniques 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.860
 third 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.860
 know is watching you go 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.740
 and 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.400
 the french boxing savate can be defined 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.210
 by 4 th 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.410
 the first is educational the second 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.200
 it's aesthetic 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.010
 the third is ethical the fourth 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.980
 it's effective 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.440
 there is also a tactical side because 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.170
 we are in a discussion and the bus 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.670
 is touching without being touched 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.700
 main physical qualities that one 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.950
 develops the balanced flexibility the 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.530
 self-control is about to 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.700
 celebrate from the hard times released without 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.230
 specially blocked was silent for a long time 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.120
 week on the heels is what actually 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.070
 we want to see them come because 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.200
 I mean wait, it's doubling 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.210
 systematically it can be at one or 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.860
 two authors but I manage to 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.870
 to double is to come and place me a little 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.960
 more sequences of points we get 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.680
 stabilize his guard one moves 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.640
 obviously effective points that 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.270
 allow to go by behind 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.230
 give them whipping free points I 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.760
 not grind in front of the face 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.160
 I touch 1 2 3 points and my leg to 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.960
 sword back and whip them a bass 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.350
 and median ding and more links 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.350
 first 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.690
 and 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.840
 everyone can practice boxing 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.000
 French boys as girls and to 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.750
 from every kid six years why 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.920
 not up to com com as in tintin's 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.650
 7 to 77 years 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.650
 then two there you see that would kill that 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.120
 barrier jean behind his militia sa 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.120
 guard one moves
