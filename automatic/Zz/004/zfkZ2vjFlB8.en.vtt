00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:07.169
 well let's start with this little 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.169
 tutorial how to install 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:15.890
 by infinity the virtual version of 8.0 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:19.220
 here in windows 7 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.670
 64 bit architecture like you 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.300
 can see 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.730
 also works for windows 8 windows 8.1 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.360
 and windows 10 because now well I've 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.540
 found the other method without the 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.190
 which does not detect them anymore and we proceed with 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.739
 installation 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.680
 good here as I have the program 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.290
 downloaded and in my category in my 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.030
 in my disconnection we are going to install it 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:50.290
 true 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:53.200
 now let's give him next he accepted the 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:57.400
 license terms 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:00.480
 ok next I'm going to give you full 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.480
 and ready 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.100
 we hope that we automatically have 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:14.100
 installed for the 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.000
 let's open it 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.060
 and you will not read this truth 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.350
 I close it 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:32.470
 I close 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.770
 and this method can automatically be 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:39.530
 for 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.530
 as you fanatics 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.140
 n 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.560
 the card we give you a 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.560
 and we close it 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.460
 and we are going to open one more time 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.950
 as you can see , this does not come out 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.619
 he asks us about when he teaches and that 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.870
 automatically when you are putting what 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:11.180
 What will José Jose Serra do? 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:14.910
 and what are we going to do next here 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:18.000
 this this installer that says crack 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.010
 dead on day 8 I'll leave it in the 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.830
 video description 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.370
 for that I'm going to extract these 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.710
 files put them on desktop 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.940
 true 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.520
 I already left it in the folder 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.599
 [Applause] 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.599
 [Music] 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:54.610
 and already here as we can see and already what 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.400
 we have automatically extracted what 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.340
 I will do is 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.340
 and the location of the file true 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.290
 in what I have the information now what 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.909
 I'm going to cut 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.909
 and I'm going to paste it 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.500
 [Music] 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.500
 let's wait a few minutes 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:27.160
 because it happens your little daughter's brain is 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.660
 very slow here this pod does not come out 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.060
 she contains a file with the same 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.060
 name we move it and replace it 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.740
 in replace 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.180
 more than I charged 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.450
 already 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.719
 but as we have it here copied 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.099
 automatically 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:53.640
 let's open the first one is the dow jones 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:56.430
 host patch let's pass it 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.189
 and automatically we're gone 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.579
 but perhaps not work well I 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:04.790
 to upload also the host that is also 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:07.640
 coded with bertolini 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.240
 now we are going to execute it as 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.000
 administrator 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.580
 here come the following up as 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.640
 you can see what it says to put 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:22.840
 name and jamenéi email and the log 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.600
 automatically tells me to say I'm going to 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.630
 put my blog I know myself as well as 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.320
 divine in motion 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.500
 can be any email I'm going to put 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:40.370
 I'm going to invent an email 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:44.870
 little bit in will he is dot com.py 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:47.090
 we will automatically generate it 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.900
 here we get what makes us all has 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:54.020
 been activated and we left and for what 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:57.080
 perhaps we want to close it with whom 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.240
 we have it that we have replaced it on 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.930
 vote kraft automatically we sell you 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.710
 the second one that is compressed and 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.710
 we give 7 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.880
 true 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:14.589
 and I will automatically remove it 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.210
 and the sierra 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:27.830
 confinement also returns me if in case 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.159
 some that have windows 7 windows 8 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:34.580
 windows 8.1 and windows 10 and have the 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:37.339
 problem with bértoli this host I'm going 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:42.379
 to leave in the description of the video I'm going 

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:47.509
 to copy I'm going to windows I'm going to 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:49.230
 there are 32 I go to drivers I go 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:54.409
 etc 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:57.860
 and he pasted it and replaced it ready 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:06:03.280
 and now let's open 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.280
 our our average j 8 truth 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:11.030
 no longer leaves us the picture itself now as 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:15.170
 to check 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:19.210
 in licenses they realize user email 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:22.690
 name divide and march that I am 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:26.139

 thing but invented remove it wireless 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:30.580
 dotcom point here and 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:33.729
 we can automatically connect it 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:37.349
 with our controllers as much as the 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:42.250
 pioneer of not smoking 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:42.880

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:54.449
 live rocks here we can record and 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:56.870
 we have automatically configured 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:07:01.910
 good 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:05.300
 here in audio we see the configuration in 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:07.510
 case they wish to speak they launch to issue 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:11.300
