00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.380
 they will not find the body because they never 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.900
 We have been a body 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.750
 because their sensors are connected 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.000
 demons is this the controls are the 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.400
 are disconnected use their own source 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.900
 of energy enter into this body because 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.470
 I could not overcome the reactive barriers 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.849
 of section 6 notwithstanding what they are 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.099
 witnessing now is an act of my 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.779
 own will as a way of life 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.450
 requested that he be granted asylum 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.870
 politician 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.790
 it's a joke it 's ridiculous it's programmed 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.650
 for self-preservation also 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.180
 can discuss what was of m is not more 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.240
 than a program designed for auto 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.680
 to preserve life has become more 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.440
 complex in the immense sea of 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.480
 information and life when it 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.300
 organize two species is based on the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.980
 genes as memory system therefore 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.010
 the man alone is an individual a goodbye 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.290
 to its intangible memory the memory does not 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.420
 can be defined but defines the 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.100
 humanity the birth of the 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.800
 computing and the consequent 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.540
 accumulation of endless cans has 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.420
 resulted in a new memory system 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.650
 the thought parallel to yours the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.950
 humanity has underestimated the 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.160
 consequences of computerization 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.259
 silly stuff 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.290
 all that talk does not show that it's a 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.700
 thinking way of life and can offer me 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.009
 you proof of its existence 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.500
 as to be able if neither science nor 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.020
 modern philosophy can explain what 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.689
 what is life who the hell there is 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.210
 even if you have a spirit offers us the 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.670
 freedom to criminals is wrong 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.890
 moment to desert the time without 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.720
 borrowed from my side but when acquiring a 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.270
 body now I am subjected to the 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.219
 possibility of dying fortunately in 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.590
 this country there is no death penalty is 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:47.830
 is chooses and artificially wrong 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.840
 I'm not a daughter 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:55.420
 my codename is project 250 1 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.310
 I am an entity that lives and thinks and that 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.310
 was created in the framework of information 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.150
 hear 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.760
