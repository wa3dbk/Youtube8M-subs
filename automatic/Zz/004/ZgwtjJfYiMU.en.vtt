00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
open it that's the orientation it will

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.450 
open it that's the orientation it will
record<00:01:01.980> in<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.550> if<00:01:02.699> I'm<00:01:02.850> horizontal<00:01:03.449> it'll<00:01:03.809> do

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
record in so if I'm horizontal it'll do

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.140 
record in so if I'm horizontal it'll do
landscape<00:01:05.460> if<00:01:05.580> I'm<00:01:05.700> holding<00:01:05.820> my<00:01:06.000> phone

landscape if I'm holding my phone

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.700 
landscape if I'm holding my phone
vertically<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.990> get<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.229> picture

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
vertically you get the picture

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.410 
vertically you get the picture
so<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.490> open<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.760> application<00:01:08.880> and
