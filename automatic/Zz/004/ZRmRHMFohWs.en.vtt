effort<00:01:50.810> constant<00:01:51.810> wattage<00:01:53.930> that'll<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:54.990> a

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
effort constant wattage that'll be a

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.080 
effort constant wattage that'll be a
great<00:01:55.170> first<00:01:55.410> step<00:01:55.550> once<00:01:56.550> you<00:01:56.610> have<00:01:56.789> your<00:01:56.910> base

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
down base mileage and again the base

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.070 
down base mileage and again the base
mileage<00:02:01.830> is<00:02:02.420> going<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.509> be<00:02:03.570> just<00:02:03.780> getting<00:02:03.990> out

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
concentrate on keeping it at a certain

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.440 
concentrate on keeping it at a certain
wattage<00:02:09.869> for<00:02:10.229> me<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:11.030> want<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.090> for<00:02:12.269> base

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
wattage for me I want it for base

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:20.110 
wattage for me I want it for base
mileage<00:02:13.310> is<00:02:14.310> about<00:02:15.920> 250<00:02:16.920> or<00:02:17.070> 260<00:02:17.610> watts<00:02:18.030> so

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.490 
miserable after the road the ride ended
but<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:01.090> will<00:03:01.209> get<00:03:01.360> so<00:03:01.599> strong<00:03:02.019> in<00:03:02.260> such<00:03:02.470> a

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
but you will get so strong in such a

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.540 
but you will get so strong in such a
hurry<00:03:03.060> so<00:03:04.060> those<00:03:04.690> are<00:03:04.870> base<00:03:05.019> miles<00:03:05.370> do<00:03:06.370> that

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
hurry so those are base miles do that

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.420 
hurry so those are base miles do that
for<00:03:06.760> probably<00:03:07.380> 2<00:03:08.380> or<00:03:08.410> 3<00:03:08.739> months<00:03:09.099> you'll<00:03:09.370> be

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
for probably 2 or 3 months you'll be

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:16.470 
for probably 2 or 3 months you'll be
super<00:03:09.819> strong<00:03:10.090> but<00:03:11.050> then<00:03:11.260> step<00:03:12.160> 2<00:03:12.480> is<00:03:15.480> getting

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
super strong but then step 2 is getting

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.690 
super strong but then step 2 is getting
in<00:03:16.720> race<00:03:16.930> form<00:03:17.290> once<00:03:18.250> you<00:03:18.340> have<00:03:18.430> your<00:03:18.549> base
