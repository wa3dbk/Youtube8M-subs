be sure that it's really blended and the
best<00:04:00.070> way<00:04:00.280> to<00:04:00.430> do<00:04:00.850> that<00:04:00.880> is<00:04:01.450> by<00:04:01.870> simply<00:04:02.440> using

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
best way to do that is by simply using

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.540 
best way to do that is by simply using
an<00:04:04.480> eyebrow<00:04:04.990> brush<00:04:05.290> and<00:04:05.650> they<00:04:05.830> are<00:04:06.010> specific

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
an eyebrow brush and they are specific

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.400 
an eyebrow brush and they are specific
brushes<00:04:06.760> that<00:04:07.000> are<00:04:07.180> made<00:04:07.480> for<00:04:07.690> eyebrows<00:04:08.110> and

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
brushes that are made for eyebrows and

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.300 
brushes that are made for eyebrows and
these<00:04:08.890> are<00:04:09.070> usually<00:04:09.430> made<00:04:09.610> of<00:04:09.820> like<00:04:10.030> a<00:04:10.630> rough

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
these are usually made of like a rough

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.340 
these are usually made of like a rough
sort<00:04:12.310> of<00:04:12.490> dense<00:04:12.730> en<00:04:13.150> it's<00:04:13.390> slanted<00:04:13.960> but<00:04:14.170> the

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
sort of dense en it's slanted but the

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.080 
sort of dense en it's slanted but the
reason<00:04:14.620> for<00:04:15.220> this<00:04:15.370> is<00:04:15.610> that<00:04:15.640> you<00:04:15.910> can<00:04:16.060> actually

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
reason for this is that you can actually

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.160 
reason for this is that you can actually
go<00:04:16.630> in<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:17.160> sort<00:04:18.160> of<00:04:18.250> blend<00:04:18.790> out<00:04:19.060> the<00:04:19.390> pencil

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
go in and sort of blend out the pencil

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.250 
go in and sort of blend out the pencil
so<00:04:21.010> that<00:04:21.160> it's<00:04:21.370> a<00:04:21.550> little<00:04:21.820> more<00:04:21.970> smoother<00:04:23.940> and

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
so that it's a little more smoother and

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:31.050 
so that it's a little more smoother and
not<00:04:26.260> as<00:04:26.440> drawn<00:04:26.800> on<00:04:28.740> and<00:04:29.740> lastly<00:04:30.430> what<00:04:30.850> you

out a little more it's basically drawing
around<00:07:07.320> the<00:07:07.770> eyebrow<00:07:08.160> and<00:07:08.310> blending<00:07:08.669> out<00:07:08.789> the

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:09.030 
around the eyebrow and blending out the

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.670 
around the eyebrow and blending out the
edges<00:07:10.669> so<00:07:11.669> automatically<00:07:12.419> my<00:07:12.810> eyebrows<00:07:13.260> stand

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 
edges so automatically my eyebrows stand

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.760 
edges so automatically my eyebrows stand
out<00:07:13.949> a<00:07:14.280> little<00:07:14.669> more<00:07:14.970> and<00:07:15.570> they<00:07:16.440> look<00:07:16.620> more

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:16.770 
out a little more and they look more

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:22.160 
out a little more and they look more
pronounced<00:07:17.370> and<00:07:17.690> nita<00:07:18.690> so<00:07:19.590> this<00:07:19.800> is<00:07:19.830> my<00:07:20.099> two
