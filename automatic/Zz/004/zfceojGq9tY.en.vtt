00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.400
 signs and colors meet in 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.699
 a harmonious dance dynamic forms 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.579
 mark the space that is filled with 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:34.850
 emotional vibrations are the compositions 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:37.550
 by flavio zohner an explosion of fresh 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.620
 vitality born in Trentino 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.559
 in the fifties flavio zohner 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.680
 emigrates to argentina with his family here 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.260
 he follows drawing and painting lessons and yes 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.000
 diploma at the art school 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:54.250
 back in Italy begins a journey of 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.250
 competitions exhibitions with excellent results 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.520
 his work embraces several 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.170
 issues from an initial study of 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.080
 landscape according to style 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.660
 impressionistic then the enchantment in the 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.640
 80s for the Venetian tradition of 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.729
 carnival that will become the protagonist 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.000
 absolute of his enigmatic lands ed 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:22.240
 fascinating and finally a new twist 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.350
 towards informal painting based on 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.350
 chromatic dynamism 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.470
 a swirl of colors declined in 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:39.520
 infinite shades generates an overwhelming 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:43.210
 formal rhythm broken by dark marks and 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.810
 I also decided that they quickly capture and 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.390
 they involve visions to the observer 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.330
 irrational and unconscious that yes 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.930
 materialize thoughts on the canvas 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.300
 fantasies and dreams that merge reality and 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.060
 imagination 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.399
 because there is real not real visible e 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.520
 invisible in the flavio zoller canvases 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.410
 opposites attract and yet 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.030
 abandoning a link with reality 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.330
 objective 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.810
 the artist explores the boundaries of research 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.850
 those feelings and real emotions 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.370
 feelings that come from games 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.640
 chromatic by the fragmentation of the 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.070
 forms from a whole series of effects 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.730
 rhythmic generated by speed 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.730
 and dynamism 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:39.230
 catch the eye and paintings of flavia 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.330
 zohner and accompany us in one 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.480
 always new artistic dimension 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.720
 elegant and harmonious a dimension that 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.670
 it becomes more and more spiritual but flavia 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.150
 john was not denying the previous ones 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.450
 stylistic choices that indeed emerge in 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.580
 a chromatic representation 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.310
 enigmatic sentimental and emotional 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.060
 able to always arouse feelings 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.060
 different
