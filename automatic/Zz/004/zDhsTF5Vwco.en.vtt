00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:19.969 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:22.309 

hmm<00:05:21.090> didn't<00:05:21.449> spawn<00:05:21.599> a<00:05:21.629> thing<00:05:21.930> while<00:05:22.110> I<00:05:22.139> was

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.319 
hmm didn't spawn a thing while I was

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.469 
hmm didn't spawn a thing while I was
airborne<00:05:22.710> maybe<00:05:23.310> up<00:05:23.550> to<00:05:23.580> much<00:05:23.849> faith<00:05:24.120> in<00:05:24.330> your

airborne maybe up to much faith in your
detector<00:05:24.900> it<00:05:24.990> could<00:05:25.229> be<00:05:25.379> faulty

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 
detector it could be faulty

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:27.499 
detector it could be faulty
well<00:05:26.219> dr.<00:05:26.550> Gilmore<00:05:26.939> was<00:05:27.090> the<00:05:27.240> one<00:05:27.360> who

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:27.509 
well dr. Gilmore was the one who

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:29.300 
well dr. Gilmore was the one who
invented<00:05:27.779> this<00:05:28.080> gizmo<00:05:28.289> so<00:05:28.710> we<00:05:28.830> can<00:05:28.949> be<00:05:29.069> pretty

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
invented this gizmo so we can be pretty

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.309 
invented this gizmo so we can be pretty
sure<00:05:29.520> it<00:05:29.669> works<00:05:29.849> according<00:05:30.120> to<00:05:30.389> specs<00:05:30.689> here

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:31.319 
sure it works according to specs here

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:33.890 
sure it works according to specs here
looks<00:05:32.310> like<00:05:32.400> a<00:05:32.520> baby<00:05:32.909> monitor<00:05:33.389> to<00:05:33.419> me<00:05:33.689> hear
