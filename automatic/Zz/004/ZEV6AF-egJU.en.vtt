caylor's<00:00:52.140> we<00:00:53.140> go

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.150 

the<00:00:59.090> only<00:00:59.300> difference<00:00:59.480> is<00:00:59.900> I<00:01:00.290> got<00:01:00.650> the<00:01:00.770> nova

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
the only difference is I got the nova

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.000 
the only difference is I got the nova
launcher<00:01:01.310> installed<00:01:02.240> so<00:01:02.810> it<00:01:03.500> won't<00:01:03.800> look<00:01:03.950> the

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
launcher installed so it won't look the

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:11.670 
launcher installed so it won't look the
same<00:01:05.410> it's<00:01:06.410> still<00:01:06.710> loading<00:01:06.950> right<00:01:07.310> now<00:01:07.520> so

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.740 

there<00:01:12.680> we<00:01:12.800> go<00:01:13.240> probably<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:14.300> first<00:01:14.480> thing<00:01:14.570> i

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
there we go probably the first thing i

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.040 
there we go probably the first thing i
want<00:01:14.900> to<00:01:14.930> show<00:01:15.080> really<00:01:15.740> quickly<00:01:15.770> as

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
want to show really quickly as

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.820 
want to show really quickly as
multi-touch<00:01:18.050> or<00:01:18.320> touch<00:01:18.920> response<00:01:19.460> on<00:01:19.970> it<00:01:20.830> you

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
multi-touch or touch response on it you

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.290
