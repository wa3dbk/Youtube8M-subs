00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
even loading is that again I am lagging

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.390 
even loading is that again I am lagging
so<00:00:21.689> badly<00:00:22.020> which<00:00:22.590> we<00:00:22.800> should<00:00:23.010> have<00:00:23.130> done<00:00:23.279> this

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
so badly which we should have done this

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.950 
so badly which we should have done this
in<00:00:23.550> my<00:00:23.730> world<00:00:24.000> we're<00:00:24.420> probably<00:00:24.570> make<00:00:24.869> another

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
in my world we're probably make another

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.810 
in my world we're probably make another
video<00:00:25.380> doing<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:25.890> in<00:00:26.039> my<00:00:26.189> world<00:00:26.430> consumer

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
video doing this in my world consumer

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.400 
video doing this in my world consumer
sooner<00:00:27.359> or<00:00:27.449> later<00:00:27.510> we're<00:00:27.750> gonna<00:00:27.810> actually<00:00:28.050> do

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
sooner or later we're gonna actually do

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.939 
sooner or later we're gonna actually do
that<00:00:28.710> just<00:00:29.519> not<00:00:29.880> for<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.240> long<00:00:30.390> while<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:31.109> yeah

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
that just not for a long while so yeah

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.250 
that just not for a long while so yeah
by<00:00:32.610> then<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:33.090> think<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.809> everyone<00:00:34.050> will

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
by then I think that everyone will

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.670 
by then I think that everyone will
forget<00:00:35.329> well<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:37.020> going<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.230> be<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.530> is

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
forget well this is going to be this is

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.930 
forget well this is going to be this is
going<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.890> look<00:00:38.010> cool<00:00:38.250> at<00:00:38.489> least<00:00:38.520> for<00:00:38.700> me

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
going to look cool at least for me

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.490 
going to look cool at least for me
because<00:00:39.149> it's<00:00:39.270> gonna<00:00:39.360> last<00:00:39.690> longer<00:00:40.079> because

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
because it's gonna last longer because

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.500 
because it's gonna last longer because
I'm<00:00:40.860> nervous<00:00:41.010> green<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.579> was<00:00:41.940> already<00:00:42.239> almost

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
I'm nervous green it was already almost

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.540 
I'm nervous green it was already almost
done<00:00:42.960> or<00:00:43.290> pretty<00:00:43.559> much<00:00:43.620> was<00:00:43.860> already<00:00:44.070> done<00:00:44.280> at

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
done or pretty much was already done at

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.819 
done or pretty much was already done at
the<00:00:44.760> 3-minute<00:00:45.480> mark<00:00:45.719> but<00:00:46.200> for<00:00:46.350> me<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.739> was

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
the 3-minute mark but for me it was

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.860 
the 3-minute mark but for me it was
still<00:00:47.100> gone<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.910> at<00:00:48.239> least<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.510> guys<00:00:48.629> could

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
still gone so at least you guys could

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.630 
still gone so at least you guys could
actually<00:00:49.020> see<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.410> fire<00:00:49.649> last<00:00:50.010> longer<00:00:50.489> than

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
actually see the fire last longer than

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.819 
actually see the fire last longer than
what<00:00:51.120> they've<00:00:51.360> seen<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.199> I'm<00:00:52.440> just<00:00:52.559> gonna<00:00:52.649> be

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
what they've seen so I'm just gonna be

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.979 
what they've seen so I'm just gonna be
running<00:00:53.100> around<00:00:53.190> just<00:00:53.730> putting<00:00:54.449> fire

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
running around just putting fire

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.110 
running around just putting fire
everywhere<00:00:55.590> everyone<00:00:56.370> standing<00:00:56.850> still<00:00:57.090> so

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
everywhere everyone standing still so

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.810 
everywhere everyone standing still so
that<00:00:57.690> just<00:00:57.930> proves<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.920> was<00:00:59.100> lagging<00:00:59.550> for

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
that just proves that it was lagging for

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.810 
that just proves that it was lagging for
me<00:01:00.020> and<00:01:01.020> again<00:01:01.680> look<00:01:01.980> at<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> slide<00:01:02.430> show<00:01:02.460> we

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
me and again look at the slide show we

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.280 
me and again look at the slide show we
did<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.059> at<00:01:03.210> night<00:01:03.510> because<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:04.080> would<00:01:04.170> be

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
did it at night because it would be

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.750 
did it at night because it would be
better<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.860> it's<00:01:05.040> going<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.250> show<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.460> lot<00:01:05.670> of

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
better and it's going to show a lot of

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.820 
better and it's going to show a lot of
things<00:01:05.970> burning<00:01:06.479> at<00:01:06.630> night<00:01:06.840> rather<00:01:07.380> than<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
things burning at night rather than the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.609 
things burning at night rather than the
daytime<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:09.119> kind<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.689> figured<00:01:09.810> out<00:01:10.080> sooner

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
daytime so I kind of figured out sooner

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.230 
daytime so I kind of figured out sooner
or<00:01:10.710> later<00:01:10.770> was<00:01:10.979> like<00:01:11.130> up<00:01:11.310> i'm<00:01:11.520> lagging<00:01:11.729> okay

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
or later was like up i'm lagging okay

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.120 
or later was like up i'm lagging okay
I'm<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.390> gonna<00:01:12.600> keep<00:01:12.840> T<00:01:13.110> continue<00:01:13.860> doing

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
I'm just gonna keep T continue doing

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.810 
I'm just gonna keep T continue doing
this<00:01:14.310> well<00:01:15.090> everything's<00:01:15.930> okay<00:01:16.520> it<00:01:17.520> was<00:01:17.670> like

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
this well everything's okay it was like

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.370 
this well everything's okay it was like
you<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.119> badly<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.630> couldn't<00:01:18.990> even<00:01:19.140> drop

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
you so badly that couldn't even drop

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.560 
you so badly that couldn't even drop
anything<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.280> for<00:01:21.000> me<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.150> was<00:01:21.420> still

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
anything so that for me I was still

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.060 
anything so that for me I was still
walking<00:01:21.780> around<00:01:21.990> I'm<00:01:22.320> just<00:01:22.590> surprised<00:01:22.920> i

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
walking around I'm just surprised i

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.010 
walking around I'm just surprised i
haven't<00:01:23.130> lagged<00:01:23.640> out<00:01:23.880> just<00:01:24.240> more<00:01:24.390> or<00:01:24.509> less<00:01:24.689> at

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
haven't lagged out just more or less at

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.020 
haven't lagged out just more or less at
i'm<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.650> lagging<00:01:26.070> some<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.610> spots<00:01:26.820> I've

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
i'm so lagging some of the spots I've

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.340 
i'm so lagging some of the spots I've
already<00:01:27.180> burned<00:01:27.509> was<00:01:27.659> already<00:01:27.900> burned<00:01:28.140> down

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
already burned was already burned down

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.260 
already burned was already burned down
so<00:01:28.590> I'm<00:01:28.650> just<00:01:28.860> basically<00:01:29.100> putting<00:01:29.490> fire<00:01:29.970> onto

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
so I'm just basically putting fire onto

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.530 
so I'm just basically putting fire onto
a<00:01:30.420> floor<00:01:30.869> with<00:01:31.650> nothing<00:01:32.040> around<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.909> i<00:01:33.329> gotta

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
a floor with nothing around and i gotta

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.749 
a floor with nothing around and i gotta
say<00:01:33.780> i<00:01:34.049> actually<00:01:34.530> liked<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:34.920> idea<00:01:35.130> my<00:01:35.460> friend

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
say i actually liked this idea my friend

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
gave me some Flint as I have fun it's

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.429 
gave me some Flint as I have fun it's
like<00:01:39.000> when<00:01:39.479> I'm<00:01:39.750> gonna<00:01:39.930> make<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> video<00:01:40.259> about

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
like when I'm gonna make a video about

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.740 
like when I'm gonna make a video about
this<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.979> should<00:01:41.159> be<00:01:41.250> here<00:01:41.490> too<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.600> was

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
this you should be here too so it was

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.020 
this you should be here too so it was

all good it's all for fun and we have
all<00:01:45.180> these<00:01:45.299> trees<00:01:45.600> burning<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
all these trees burning in the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.200 
all these trees burning in the
background<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:46.890> really<00:01:47.159> hope<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.610> none<00:01:48.180> of

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
background I really hope that none of

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.120 
background I really hope that none of
the<00:01:48.360> tree<00:01:48.570> huggers<00:01:48.990> or<00:01:49.409> whatever<00:01:49.950> little

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
the tree huggers or whatever little

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.920 
the tree huggers or whatever little
ecosystem<00:01:50.520> ists<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.360> don't<00:01:51.570> even<00:01:51.659> know<00:01:51.810> what

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
ecosystem ists I don't even know what

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.929 
ecosystem ists I don't even know what
they<00:01:52.079> are<00:01:52.110> honestly<00:01:52.680> they<00:01:53.189> don't<00:01:53.369> go<00:01:53.490> after<00:01:53.670> me

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
they are honestly they don't go after me

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.850 
they are honestly they don't go after me
especially<00:01:54.299> for<00:01:54.600> pixelate<00:01:55.020> burning<00:01:55.470> up<00:01:55.560> trees

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
especially for pixelate burning up trees

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.130 
especially for pixelate burning up trees
oh<00:01:56.100> look<00:01:56.610> at<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.790> fire<00:01:57.060> over<00:01:57.360> there<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.990> looks

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
oh look at the fire over there it looks

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.319 
oh look at the fire over there it looks
cool<00:01:58.590> honestly<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.490> fire<00:01:59.670> looks<00:01:59.909> cool<00:02:00.119> and

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
cool honestly the fire looks cool and

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.120 
cool honestly the fire looks cool and
he's<00:02:00.750> throwing<00:02:00.990> snowballs<00:02:01.500> at<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.860> fire

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
he's throwing snowballs at the fire

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.670 
he's throwing snowballs at the fire
Koosh<00:02:02.850> fought<00:02:03.390> like<00:02:03.810> throwing<00:02:04.170> snowballs<00:02:04.590> at

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
Koosh fought like throwing snowballs at

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.780 
Koosh fought like throwing snowballs at
the<00:02:04.770> fire<00:02:04.920> trying<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.219> put<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.460> out<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.610> was<00:02:05.759> like

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
the fire trying to put it out I was like

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.370 
the fire trying to put it out I was like
open<00:02:06.270> it's<00:02:06.360> not<00:02:06.540> gonna<00:02:06.659> work<00:02:06.719> in<00:02:07.290> the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
open it's not gonna work in the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.109 
open it's not gonna work in the
snowballs<00:02:07.799> caught<00:02:08.009> on<00:02:08.160> fire<00:02:08.340> which<00:02:08.879> was

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
snowballs caught on fire which was

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.150 
snowballs caught on fire which was
another<00:02:09.390> logic<00:02:09.989> fail<00:02:10.200> on<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:10.410> part<00:02:10.890> and

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
another logic fail on that part and

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.540 
another logic fail on that part and
yeah<00:02:12.490> they<00:02:13.060> look<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:13.390> cow<00:02:13.600> so<00:02:14.530> this<00:02:15.070> is<00:02:15.250> one<00:02:15.520> of

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
yeah they look a cow so this is one of

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.010 
yeah they look a cow so this is one of
the<00:02:15.670> fun<00:02:15.820> things<00:02:15.850> you<00:02:16.150> can<00:02:16.240> do<00:02:16.570> if<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:16.840> have<00:02:16.990> a

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
the fun things you can do if you have a

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.540 
the fun things you can do if you have a
large<00:02:17.380> force<00:02:17.770> you<00:02:17.950> want<00:02:18.130> to<00:02:18.190> take<00:02:18.310> it<00:02:18.400> all<00:02:18.520> down

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
large force you want to take it all down

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.210 
large force you want to take it all down
get<00:02:19.240> to<00:02:19.690> get<00:02:19.930> some<00:02:20.080> flint<00:02:20.320> and<00:02:20.380> steel<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:21.010> just

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
get to get some flint and steel and just

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.240 
get to get some flint and steel and just
pretty<00:02:21.730> much<00:02:21.880> set<00:02:22.180> one<00:02:22.360> tree<00:02:22.570> on<00:02:22.660> fire<00:02:23.130> look<00:02:24.130> at

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
pretty much set one tree on fire look at

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.460 
pretty much set one tree on fire look at
all<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.430> snowballs<00:02:24.700> spazzing<00:02:25.570> out<00:02:25.690> set<00:02:26.320> one

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
all the snowballs spazzing out set one

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.690 
all the snowballs spazzing out set one
tree<00:02:26.650> on<00:02:26.770> fire<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.160> if<00:02:27.250> they're<00:02:27.370> next<00:02:27.550> to<00:02:27.670> each

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
tree on fire and if they're next to each

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.310 
tree on fire and if they're next to each
other<00:02:27.940> then<00:02:28.210> watch<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.570> whole<00:02:28.750> force<00:02:29.050> burn

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
other then watch the whole force burn

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.950 
other then watch the whole force burn
down<00:02:29.590> I<00:02:30.120> have<00:02:31.120> no<00:02:31.270> idea<00:02:31.330> what<00:02:31.540> they're<00:02:31.660> doing

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
down I have no idea what they're doing

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.860 
down I have no idea what they're doing
because<00:02:32.020> it's<00:02:32.770> really<00:02:33.130> laggy<00:02:33.520> for<00:02:33.640> me<00:02:33.970> and<00:02:34.600> if

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
because it's really laggy for me and if

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.990 
because it's really laggy for me and if
those<00:02:35.560> trees<00:02:35.830> are<00:02:35.950> still<00:02:36.220> on<00:02:36.340> fire<00:02:36.610> for<00:02:36.850> me

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
those trees are still on fire for me

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.730 
those trees are still on fire for me
while<00:02:37.270> theirs<00:02:37.540> is<00:02:37.720> like<00:02:37.900> up<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.320> trees<00:02:38.560> gone

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
while theirs is like up the trees gone

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.680 
while theirs is like up the trees gone
and<00:02:39.010> right<00:02:39.460> here<00:02:39.640> I'm<00:02:39.820> trying<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.180> drop<00:02:40.330> flint

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
and right here I'm trying to drop flint

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.570 
and right here I'm trying to drop flint
I<00:02:40.810> keep<00:02:40.990> trying<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.410> drop<00:02:41.560> Lynn<00:02:41.890> but<00:02:42.340> he's<00:02:42.430> told

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
I keep trying to drop Lynn but he's told

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.610 
I keep trying to drop Lynn but he's told
me<00:02:42.670> here<00:02:42.820> to<00:02:42.940> drop<00:02:43.090> flint<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:43.510> a<00:02:43.630> pickaxe<00:02:44.140> so<00:02:44.590> I

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
me here to drop flint and a pickaxe so I

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.230 
me here to drop flint and a pickaxe so I
was<00:02:44.800> like<00:02:44.890> whatever<00:02:45.550> I'm<00:02:45.880> just<00:02:46.060> going<00:02:46.210> to

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
was like whatever I'm just going to

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.510 
was like whatever I'm just going to
continue<00:02:46.360> going<00:02:47.260> around<00:02:47.620> strata<00:02:48.010> burn<00:02:48.190> things

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
continue going around strata burn things

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.970 
continue going around strata burn things
so<00:02:49.210> I<00:02:49.630> don't<00:02:49.900> know<00:02:50.020> like<00:02:50.200> I<00:02:50.530> said<00:02:50.710> it<00:02:50.890> was

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
so I don't know like I said it was

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.490 
so I don't know like I said it was
really<00:02:51.310> really<00:02:51.520> like<00:02:51.730> it<00:02:51.760> for<00:02:52.030> me<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.500> at

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
really really like it for me and at

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.140 
really really like it for me and at
least<00:02:53.650> on<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:53.980> spots<00:02:54.250> I've<00:02:54.400> already<00:02:54.550> shown<00:02:54.880> so

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
least on the spots I've already shown so

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.910 
least on the spots I've already shown so
the<00:02:55.270> spots<00:02:55.510> have<00:02:55.630> already<00:02:55.870> disappeared<00:02:56.020> but<00:02:56.770> I

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
the spots have already disappeared but I

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.170 
the spots have already disappeared but I
actually<00:02:57.160> do<00:02:57.430> like<00:02:57.460> the<00:02:57.730> light<00:02:57.910> show<00:02:58.150> in

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
actually do like the light show in

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.660 
actually do like the light show in
itself<00:02:58.720> so<00:02:59.440> again<00:03:00.100> this<00:03:00.220> is<00:03:00.370> one<00:03:00.520> of<00:03:00.580> the

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
itself so again this is one of the

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.220 
itself so again this is one of the
things<00:03:00.820> you<00:03:00.910> could<00:03:01.060> actually<00:03:01.150> do<00:03:01.450> for<00:03:01.690> fun<00:03:01.900> if

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
things you could actually do for fun if

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
apparently I was already like on fire

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.300 
apparently I was already like on fire
five<00:03:28.720> minutes<00:03:29.050> ago<00:03:29.140> but<00:03:29.500> it<00:03:29.680> just<00:03:29.830> caught<00:03:30.100> up

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
five minutes ago but it just caught up

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.550 
five minutes ago but it just caught up
with<00:03:30.490> me<00:03:30.610> at<00:03:30.760> that<00:03:31.030> point<00:03:31.270> so<00:03:31.570> let's<00:03:32.200> see<00:03:32.350> when

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
with me at that point so let's see when

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.050 
with me at that point so let's see when
I'm<00:03:32.680> actually<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:33.100> catch<00:03:33.250> on<00:03:33.400> fire<00:03:33.640> I<00:03:33.910> don't

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
I'm actually the catch on fire I don't

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.610 
I'm actually the catch on fire I don't
even<00:03:34.180> know<00:03:34.450> I<00:03:34.720> don't<00:03:34.810> even<00:03:34.990> remember<00:03:35.200> when<00:03:35.560> I

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
even know I don't even remember when I

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.290 
even know I don't even remember when I
catch<00:03:35.860> on<00:03:36.040> fire<00:03:36.250> it<00:03:36.700> was<00:03:36.820> just<00:03:36.910> more<00:03:37.090> or<00:03:37.180> less

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
catch on fire it was just more or less

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.610 
catch on fire it was just more or less
funny<00:03:37.600> if<00:03:37.780> only<00:03:38.020> I<00:03:38.080> could<00:03:38.260> record<00:03:38.530> the

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
funny if only I could record the

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.280 
funny if only I could record the
commentary<00:03:39.190> in<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:39.610> video<00:03:39.940> again<00:03:40.090> I'm<00:03:40.450> still

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
commentary in the video again I'm still

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.660 
commentary in the video again I'm still
trying<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.590> figure<00:03:41.770> out<00:03:41.920> how<00:03:42.190> to<00:03:42.250> actually

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
trying to figure out how to actually

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.610 
trying to figure out how to actually
record<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:43.360> audio<00:03:43.540> as<00:03:44.050> I'm<00:03:44.410> actually

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
record the audio as I'm actually

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.350 
record the audio as I'm actually
recording<00:03:45.160> so<00:03:45.340> that<00:03:45.580> you<00:03:45.910> could<00:03:46.030> actually<00:03:46.060> get

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
recording so that you could actually get

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.880 
recording so that you could actually get
some<00:03:46.540> real<00:03:46.780> time<00:03:47.020> recording<00:03:47.500> at<00:03:47.620> least<00:03:47.770> you'll

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
some real time recording at least you'll

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.830 
some real time recording at least you'll
know<00:03:47.920> what<00:03:48.190> I'm<00:03:48.370> feeling<00:03:48.970> at<00:03:49.360> that<00:03:49.390> time

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
know what I'm feeling at that time

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.690 
know what I'm feeling at that time
rather<00:03:50.080> than<00:03:50.290> me<00:03:50.590> just<00:03:50.830> have<00:03:50.980> a<00:03:51.010> pre-recording

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
rather than me just have a pre-recording

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.550 
rather than me just have a pre-recording
and<00:03:51.790> then<00:03:51.880> record<00:03:52.239> over<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:52.690> comp<00:03:53.020> or<00:03:53.170> the

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
and then record over the comp or the

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.420 
and then record over the comp or the

two<00:06:52.990> now<00:06:53.890> that's<00:06:54.160> pretty<00:06:54.430> much<00:06:54.580> three<00:06:54.880> months

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.210 
two now that's pretty much three months

as i know of having a hundred people on
list<00:06:58.960> and<00:06:59.200> by<00:07:00.010> then<00:07:00.280> it's<00:07:00.520> gonna<00:07:00.640> be<00:07:00.790> probably

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.030 
list and by then it's gonna be probably

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.700 
list and by then it's gonna be probably
up<00:07:01.300> to<00:07:01.420> 200<00:07:01.870> people<00:07:02.080> on<00:07:02.110> the<00:07:02.230> list<00:07:02.470> so<00:07:02.560> that's

up to 200 people on the list so that's

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.220 
up to 200 people on the list so that's
going<00:07:02.860> to<00:07:02.920> be<00:07:03.010> 200<00:07:03.700> videos<00:07:03.820> one<00:07:04.540> for<00:07:04.570> every<00:07:04.960> day

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:05.230 
going to be 200 videos one for every day

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.100 
going to be 200 videos one for every day
and<00:07:05.500> let's<00:07:06.220> see<00:07:06.610> how<00:07:06.820> that<00:07:06.880> goes<00:07:07.090> see<00:07:07.930> if<00:07:08.050> I

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.110 
and let's see how that goes see if I

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.600 
and let's see how that goes see if I
could<00:07:08.170> actually<00:07:08.290> keep<00:07:08.680> up<00:07:08.920> with<00:07:09.130> it<00:07:09.310> if<00:07:09.430> not

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:09.610 
could actually keep up with it if not

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.370 
could actually keep up with it if not
then<00:07:09.820> I'm<00:07:09.910> gonna<00:07:10.000> have<00:07:10.120> to<00:07:10.240> probably<00:07:10.750> post<00:07:11.200> two
