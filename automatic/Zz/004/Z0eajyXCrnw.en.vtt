before<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.260> came<00:00:37.440> out<00:00:37.590> like<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.610> mean<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.969> course

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
before it came out like I mean of course

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.880 
before it came out like I mean of course
it's<00:00:39.360> going<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.570> have<00:00:39.690> lag<00:00:39.960> it's<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.410> brand<00:00:40.739> new

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
it's going to have lag it's a brand new

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.040 
it's going to have lag it's a brand new
system<00:00:41.430> with<00:00:42.000> motion<00:00:42.450> tracking<00:00:42.690> what<00:00:42.930> do<00:00:42.989> you

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
system with motion tracking what do you

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.979 
system with motion tracking what do you
expect<00:00:43.410> um<00:00:43.730> yeah<00:00:44.730> there's<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.030> bit<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.329> lag<00:00:45.690> but

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
expect um yeah there's a bit of lag but

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.690 
expect um yeah there's a bit of lag but
you<00:00:46.200> can<00:00:46.379> get<00:00:46.500> used<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.430> only<00:00:47.670> other

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
you can get used to it the only other

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.160 
you can get used to it the only other
like<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.210> do<00:00:48.270> not<00:00:48.420> like<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:48.870> when<00:00:49.020> you're

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
like I do not like is when you're

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.049 
like I do not like is when you're
jumping<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:49.800> connected<00:00:50.219> ventures<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.730> doesn't

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
jumping in connected ventures it doesn't

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.630 
jumping in connected ventures it doesn't
recognize<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:51.870> right<00:00:51.989> away<00:00:52.399> other<00:00:53.399> than<00:00:53.550> that

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
recognize it right away other than that

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.910 
recognize it right away other than that
another<00:00:54.510> little<00:00:54.780> glitchy<00:00:55.020> thing<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.590> when

that's<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.420> little<00:01:15.630> glitch<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.320> have<00:01:16.619> while

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
that's a little glitch I have while

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.359 
that's a little glitch I have while
playing<00:01:17.479> Kinect<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.770> recognition

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
playing Kinect is that the recognition

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.210 
playing Kinect is that the recognition
of<00:01:20.430> different<00:01:20.790> people<00:01:21.060> isn't<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.540> good<00:01:22.380> well

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
of different people isn't that good well

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.450 
of different people isn't that good well
other<00:01:23.460> than<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.710> overall<00:01:25.710> lag<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.280> not

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
other than that the overall lag is not

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.160 
other than that the overall lag is not
that<00:01:26.670> bad<00:01:26.880> weather<00:01:27.180> con<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.990> pause

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
that bad weather con is the pause

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.560 
that bad weather con is the pause
feature<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:29.369> have<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.700> like<00:01:29.880> move<00:01:30.180> your<00:01:30.390> hand

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
in a 45 degree angle just like that as

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.870 
in a 45 degree angle just like that as
you<00:01:32.520> see<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.790> picture<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.560> that's<00:01:34.560> just

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
you see in the picture and that's just

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.670 
you see in the picture and that's just
uncomfortable<00:01:35.880> but<00:01:36.720> what<00:01:37.500> do<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.619> expect

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
uncomfortable but what do you expect

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.010 
uncomfortable but what do you expect
you're<00:01:38.369> not<00:01:38.490> going<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.820> make<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.869> pause

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
you're not going to make the pause

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.130 
you're not going to make the pause
future<00:01:40.409> like<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:41.180> which<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.570> probably<00:01:42.930> gonna

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
future like this which is probably gonna

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.440 
future like this which is probably gonna
be<00:01:43.200> using<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.470> lot<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.619> games<00:01:43.920> for<00:01:44.280> like<00:01:44.579> hitting

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
be using a lot of games for like hitting

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.679 
be using a lot of games for like hitting
targets<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:45.930> stuff<00:01:46.079> like<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.259> but<00:01:47.689> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
targets and stuff like that but the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.999 
targets and stuff like that but the
pause<00:01:48.899> features<00:01:49.320> should<00:01:49.470> be<00:01:49.619> improved

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
pause features should be improved

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.370 
pause features should be improved
because<00:01:50.689> there's<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:51.840> many<00:01:51.899> other<00:01:52.140> ways<00:01:52.170> about

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
because there's so many other ways about

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.590 
because there's so many other ways about
it<00:01:52.560> like<00:01:52.710> if<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:53.009> leave<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.430> screen<00:01:53.790> if<00:01:54.420> you

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
it like if you leave the screen if you

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.160 
it like if you leave the screen if you
leave<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.200> kinect<00:01:55.560> sensor<00:01:56.090> area<00:01:57.090> then<00:01:57.810> it

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
leave the kinect sensor area then it

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.569 
leave the kinect sensor area then it
should<00:01:58.350> recognize<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.770> nobody's<00:01:59.280> there<00:01:59.460> and

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
should recognize that nobody's there and

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.160 
should recognize that nobody's there and
she's<00:01:59.759> pause<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.210> game<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.420> there<00:02:00.960> should<00:02:01.079> be

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
she's pause the game and there should be

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.139 
she's pause the game and there should be

experience the probably can say is that
it's<00:03:51.320> a<00:03:51.440> great<00:03:51.740> game<00:03:52.010> for<00:03:52.430> family<00:03:52.940> and<00:03:53.180> kids

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
it's a great game for family and kids

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.560 
it's a great game for family and kids
because<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:54.980> games<00:03:55.310> are<00:03:55.640> designed<00:03:55.910> for<00:03:56.240> those

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
because the games are designed for those

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.710 
because the games are designed for those
demographics<00:03:57.940> that's<00:03:58.940> why<00:03:59.150> I<00:03:59.180> wasn't<00:03:59.540> really

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
demographics that's why I wasn't really

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.880 
demographics that's why I wasn't really
interested<00:03:59.930> in<00:04:00.140> the<00:04:00.290> games<00:04:00.470> that<00:04:00.590> much

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
interested in the games that much

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.190 
interested in the games that much
because<00:04:01.730> they're<00:04:02.000> not<00:04:02.120> that<00:04:02.270> challenging<00:04:02.510> and

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
because they're not that challenging and

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.030 
because they're not that challenging and
they<00:04:03.470> do<00:04:03.530> get<00:04:04.250> lag<00:04:04.520> of<00:04:04.550> it<00:04:04.850> but<00:04:05.570> for<00:04:06.200> family<00:04:07.010> and

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
they do get lag of it but for family and

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.510 
they do get lag of it but for family and
kids<00:04:07.430> and<00:04:07.760> people<00:04:08.120> that<00:04:08.540> want<00:04:08.810> to<00:04:08.959> do<00:04:09.950> fitness

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
kids and people that want to do fitness

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.940 
kids and people that want to do fitness
and<00:04:10.760> workouts<00:04:11.240> that's<00:04:11.690> a<00:04:11.930> huge<00:04:12.350> thing<00:04:12.440> because

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
and workouts that's a huge thing because

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.370 
and workouts that's a huge thing because
you<00:04:13.070> have<00:04:13.220> to<00:04:13.340> buy<00:04:13.520> a<00:04:13.550> stupid<00:04:14.090> refit<00:04:14.570> board<00:04:14.870> all

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
you have to buy a stupid refit board all

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.020 
you have to buy a stupid refit board all
you<00:04:15.530> gotta<00:04:15.680> do<00:04:15.860> is<00:04:15.890> just<00:04:16.130> do<00:04:16.790> your<00:04:16.880> normal

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
you gotta do is just do your normal

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.170 
you gotta do is just do your normal
workouts<00:04:17.660> and<00:04:17.930> for

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
workouts and for

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.729 
workouts and for
the<00:04:18.269> kinect<00:04:18.570> sensor<00:04:18.690> and<00:04:19.049> it<00:04:19.109> works<00:04:19.320> in<00:04:19.470> love

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
the kinect sensor and it works in love

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.680 
the kinect sensor and it works in love
because<00:04:19.919> workouts<00:04:20.430> are<00:04:20.609> slow<00:04:20.970> and<00:04:21.209> it<00:04:21.570> can

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
because workouts are slow and it can

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.480 
because workouts are slow and it can
track<00:04:21.959> you<00:04:22.139> while<00:04:22.320> you're<00:04:22.500> slow<00:04:22.770> so<00:04:23.310> if<00:04:23.370> you're

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
track you while you're slow so if you're

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.189 
track you while you're slow so if you're
looking<00:04:23.669> to<00:04:23.910> get<00:04:24.030> fit<00:04:24.389> and<00:04:24.539> you<00:04:24.660> want<00:04:25.020> some
