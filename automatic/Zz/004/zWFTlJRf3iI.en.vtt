00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
side of the island and that was pretty

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.349 
side of the island and that was pretty
cool<00:00:55.859> because<00:00:56.039> I'm<00:00:56.249> actually<00:00:56.579> i<00:00:56.820> use<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> lot<00:00:57.210> of

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359 
cool because I'm actually i use a lot of

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:59.779 
cool because I'm actually i use a lot of
air<00:00:57.570> with<00:00:57.809> my<00:00:57.839> dollies<00:00:58.289> I'm<00:00:58.920> really<00:00:59.219> far<00:00:59.579> too

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
air with my dollies I'm really far too

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.970 
air with my dollies I'm really far too
quickly<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.899> when<00:01:01.140> for<00:01:01.409> the<00:01:01.469> drift<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.739> was

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
quickly so when for the drift I was

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:02.930 
quickly so when for the drift I was
quite<00:01:02.159> good<00:01:02.190> because<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.550> didn't<00:01:02.730> have<00:01:02.760> to

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
quite good because you didn't have to

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.340 
quite good because you didn't have to
expend<00:01:03.179> much<00:01:03.359> energy<00:01:03.390> because<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.199> just

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
expend much energy because you just

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.929 
expend much energy because you just
can't<00:01:04.409> just<00:01:04.739> go<00:01:04.799> with<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:04.949> corona<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.759> we

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
can't just go with the corona so we

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:06.980 
can't just go with the corona so we
stayed<00:01:06.119> down<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> lot<00:01:06.509> longer<00:01:06.600> than<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:06.930> normally

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
stayed down a lot longer than I normally

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.230

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
which is literally just across the and

just across the way over there and but
I'm<00:01:47.670> hopefully<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.149> should<00:01:48.359> be<00:01:48.420> able<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.630> get

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
I'm hopefully I should be able to get

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.029 
I'm hopefully I should be able to get
some<00:01:48.869> more<00:01:48.930> footage<00:01:49.140> when<00:01:49.560> we're<00:01:49.680> on<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.890> boat

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
some more footage when we're on the boat

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:51.889 
some more footage when we're on the boat
as<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.789> can<00:01:50.909> see<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.240> boat<00:01:51.420> were<00:01:51.600> wrong<00:01:51.780> at

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
as you can see the boat were wrong at

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.539 
as you can see the boat were wrong at
the<00:01:51.990> moment<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.439> divert<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.009> lot<00:01:53.280> smaller

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
the moment to divert is a lot smaller

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.999 
the moment to divert is a lot smaller
than<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.210> one<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.359> was<00:01:54.539> using<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:55.140> malapascua

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
than the one I was using and malapascua

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.800 
than the one I was using and malapascua
it's<00:01:56.609> kind<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.880> got<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.090> similar<00:01:57.479> style<00:01:57.719> i'm

it's kind of got that similar style i'm
not<00:01:57.929> sure<00:01:58.049> what<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.229> boats<00:01:58.409> are<00:01:58.560> called

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770

spider legs that sort of keep out and
keep<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.820> better<00:02:03.090> boat<00:02:03.299> steady<00:02:03.539> on<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.810> water

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
keep the better boat steady on the water

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.080 
keep the better boat steady on the water
and<00:02:04.409> i<00:02:05.009> have<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.280> find<00:02:05.460> out<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.609> proper<00:02:05.850> name

tiny<00:02:08.009> one<00:02:08.310> which<00:02:08.490> is<00:02:08.520> one<00:02:08.790> we<00:02:08.910> actually<00:02:09.150> came

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
tiny one which is one we actually came

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.680 
tiny one which is one we actually came
across<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.720> island<00:02:10.050> in

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
across the island in

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.010 
across the island in
and<00:02:10.780> which<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:12.550> is<00:02:12.880> again<00:02:13.240> it<00:02:13.360> like<00:02:13.540> all<00:02:13.750> three

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
and which so is again it like all three

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.450 
and which so is again it like all three
of<00:02:14.050> our<00:02:14.230> dive<00:02:14.530> sites<00:02:14.860> have<00:02:15.100> been<00:02:15.130> really

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
of our dive sites have been really

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.890 
of our dive sites have been really
really<00:02:15.700> different<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.300> we<00:02:16.630> have<00:02:16.750> big

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
really different and we have big

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.170 
really different and we have big
motorized<00:02:17.380> boats<00:02:17.740> and<00:02:18.070> that<00:02:18.730> we<00:02:18.850> were<00:02:18.970> kind<00:02:19.150> of

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
motorized boats and that we were kind of

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.880 
motorized boats and that we were kind of
spending<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.540> whole<00:02:19.630> day<00:02:19.690> on<00:02:19.900> in<00:02:20.320> super<00:02:20.710> Dan

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
spending the whole day on in super Dan

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.100 
spending the whole day on in super Dan
and<00:02:21.130> then<00:02:21.520> I<00:02:21.640> was<00:02:21.790> on<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.360> then<00:02:22.900> on<00:02:22.960> my

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
and then I was on and then on my

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.920 
and then I was on and then on my
pasquales<00:02:23.650> obviously<00:02:24.040> on<00:02:24.130> on<00:02:24.370> these<00:02:24.580> kind<00:02:24.850> of

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
pasquales obviously on on these kind of

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.720 
pasquales obviously on on these kind of
filipino<00:02:25.930> style<00:02:26.170> ones<00:02:26.500> but<00:02:26.890> bigger<00:02:27.220> versions

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
filipino style ones but bigger versions

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.820 
filipino style ones but bigger versions
and<00:02:28.060> so<00:02:28.270> you<00:02:28.330> still<00:02:28.720> got<00:02:28.900> changed<00:02:29.350> on<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.620> deck

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
and so you still got changed on the deck

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.650 
and so you still got changed on the deck
and<00:02:29.860> stuff<00:02:30.280> before<00:02:30.640> you<00:02:30.670> went<00:02:30.880> in<00:02:31.000> or<00:02:31.390> is<00:02:31.480> here

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
and stuff before you went in or is here

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.330 
and stuff before you went in or is here
we<00:02:31.750> have<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:31.960> get<00:02:32.050> we<00:02:32.560> get<00:02:32.890> changed<00:02:33.220> at<00:02:33.280> the

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
we have to get we get changed at the

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.400 
we have to get we get changed at the
dive<00:02:33.490> school<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:34.000> literally<00:02:34.630> just<00:02:34.840> go<00:02:35.050> onto

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
dive school and literally just go onto

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.600 
dive school and literally just go onto
the<00:02:35.620> boat<00:02:35.770> you're<00:02:35.950> sitting<00:02:36.340> with<00:02:36.370> your<00:02:36.550> legs

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
the boat you're sitting with your legs

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.700 
the boat you're sitting with your legs
off<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:36.910> boat<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:37.750> just<00:02:37.900> kind<00:02:38.140> of<00:02:38.200> fall

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
off the boat and you just kind of fall

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.770 
off the boat and you just kind of fall
into<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.160> water<00:02:39.190> rather<00:02:40.030> than<00:02:40.180> setting<00:02:40.570> off

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
into the water rather than setting off

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.250 
into the water rather than setting off
way<00:02:40.960> and<00:02:41.200> doing<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.010> sort<00:02:42.160> of<00:02:42.250> step<00:02:42.640> a<00:02:42.820> large

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
way and doing the sort of step a large

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.230 
way and doing the sort of step a large
think<00:02:44.260> it's<00:02:44.350> called<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:44.530> giant<00:02:44.950> step<00:02:45.160> entry<00:02:45.580> the

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
think it's called a giant step entry the

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.030 
think it's called a giant step entry the
way<00:02:46.660> you<00:02:46.720> step<00:02:46.930> into<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.230> water<00:02:47.380> which<00:02:47.860> was

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
way you step into the water which was

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.090 
way you step into the water which was
what<00:02:48.220> we<00:02:48.340> did<00:02:48.370> in<00:02:48.750> malapascua<00:02:49.750> or<00:02:50.230> doing<00:02:50.890> the

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
what we did in malapascua or doing the

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.800 
what we did in malapascua or doing the
backwards<00:02:51.490> entry<00:02:51.790> of<00:02:51.880> the<00:02:51.910> boat<00:02:52.240> like<00:02:52.510> we<00:02:52.660> did

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
backwards entry of the boat like we did

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.080 
backwards entry of the boat like we did
sipadan<00:02:53.320> since<00:02:54.280> i<00:02:54.400> call<00:02:54.610> so<00:02:54.820> we've<00:02:54.940> done<00:02:55.060> a

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
sipadan since i call so we've done a

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.970 
sipadan since i call so we've done a
mode<00:02:55.300> variety<00:02:56.170> of<00:02:56.200> different<00:02:56.410> diving

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
mode variety of different diving

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.400 
mode variety of different diving
techniques<00:02:57.100> and<00:02:57.580> stuff<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:57.970> it's<00:02:58.960> just<00:02:59.140> nice

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
techniques and stuff and it's just nice

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.350 
techniques and stuff and it's just nice
does<00:02:59.740> it<00:02:59.860> be<00:03:00.130> able<00:03:00.370> to<00:03:00.460> go<00:03:00.550> to<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.820> depth<00:03:01.090> that

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
does it be able to go to the depth that

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.330 
does it be able to go to the depth that
we<00:03:01.900> can<00:03:02.170> a<00:03:02.200> PO<00:03:02.650> which<00:03:02.830> is<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.100> good<00:03:03.190> thing

super Dan because it does mean that we

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.230 
super Dan because it does mean that we
can<00:03:08.440> then<00:03:08.560> go<00:03:08.590> down<00:03:08.860> to<00:03:08.920> depths<00:03:09.340> of<00:03:09.430> 20<00:03:09.520> to<00:03:09.700> 25

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.850 
can then go down to depths of 20 to 25
meters<00:03:10.420> which<00:03:11.110> seemed<00:03:11.320> to<00:03:11.350> be<00:03:11.530> where<00:03:11.680> all<00:03:11.770> the

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
meters which seemed to be where all the

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.380 
meters which seemed to be where all the
good<00:03:11.980> dives<00:03:12.220> are<00:03:12.490> at<00:03:12.640> and<00:03:13.060> it<00:03:13.180> was<00:03:13.300> the<00:03:13.360> same

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
good dives are at and it was the same

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.479 
good dives are at and it was the same
thing<00:03:13.690> at<00:03:13.750> malapascua<00:03:14.080> that<00:03:14.860> fresh<00:03:15.160> a<00:03:15.190> shark

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
thing at malapascua that fresh a shark

dives<00:03:15.760> that<00:03:16.030> I<00:03:16.060> did<00:03:16.330> we<00:03:16.540> had<00:03:16.570> to<00:03:16.750> get<00:03:16.870> down<00:03:16.959> to

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
dives that I did we had to get down to

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.370 
dives that I did we had to get down to
23<00:03:17.620> meters<00:03:17.950> so<00:03:18.400> on<00:03:18.670> if<00:03:19.540> you<00:03:19.720> have<00:03:19.989> just<00:03:20.020> you

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
23 meters so on if you have just you

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.750 
23 meters so on if you have just you
open<00:03:20.650> water<00:03:20.830> you<00:03:21.040> won't<00:03:21.130> be<00:03:21.280> able<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.459> do<00:03:21.580> that

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
open water you won't be able to do that

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.220 
open water you won't be able to do that
you<00:03:22.180> won't<00:03:22.360> be<00:03:22.420> able<00:03:22.510> to<00:03:22.630> see<00:03:22.690> the<00:03:22.810> Sharks<00:03:23.110> if

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
you won't be able to see the Sharks if

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.710 
you won't be able to see the Sharks if
you<00:03:23.320> stayed<00:03:23.500> at<00:03:23.650> 18<00:03:23.980> metres<00:03:24.270> sayem<00:03:25.270> so<00:03:25.480> yet<00:03:25.690> i

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
you stayed at 18 metres sayem so yet i

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.330 
you stayed at 18 metres sayem so yet i
think<00:03:26.080> i<00:03:26.170> would<00:03:26.230> definitely<00:03:26.560> recommend<00:03:26.770> doing

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
think i would definitely recommend doing

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.860 
think i would definitely recommend doing
the<00:03:27.550> advanced<00:03:27.880> open<00:03:28.000> water<00:03:28.180> which<00:03:28.600> we<00:03:28.690> did<00:03:28.840> a

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
the advanced open water which we did a

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.540 
the advanced open water which we did a
couple<00:03:28.989> of<00:03:29.140> challenges<00:03:29.290> ago<00:03:29.800> if<00:03:30.220> you<00:03:30.430> are

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
couple of challenges ago if you are

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.220 
couple of challenges ago if you are
going<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:30.820> get<00:03:30.940> into<00:03:31.150> scuba<00:03:31.360> diving<00:03:31.810> it<00:03:32.050> is

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
going to get into scuba diving it is

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.229 
going to get into scuba diving it is
worth<00:03:32.470> going<00:03:33.040> from<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.489> open<00:03:33.700> water<00:03:33.910> to<00:03:34.120> the

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
worth going from the open water to the

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.150 
worth going from the open water to the
advanced<00:03:34.600> open<00:03:34.720> water<00:03:34.870> before<00:03:35.770> you<00:03:35.920> want<00:03:36.070> to

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
advanced open water before you want to

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.830 
advanced open water before you want to
go<00:03:36.250> any<00:03:36.430> you<00:03:36.730> know<00:03:36.850> and<00:03:37.060> do<00:03:37.330> any<00:03:37.480> of<00:03:37.600> the<00:03:37.690> really

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
go any you know and do any of the really

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.330 
go any you know and do any of the really
cool<00:03:37.930> dive<00:03:38.290> sites<00:03:38.560> because<00:03:38.800> a<00:03:38.950> lot<00:03:39.220> of<00:03:39.250> the

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
cool dive sites because a lot of the

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.220 
cool dive sites because a lot of the
best<00:03:39.519> time<00:03:39.730> will<00:03:40.269> be<00:03:40.390> at<00:03:40.480> those<00:03:40.600> deeper<00:03:40.900> depths

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
best time will be at those deeper depths

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.110 
best time will be at those deeper depths
and<00:03:41.410> I'm<00:03:41.709> malapascua<00:03:42.070> I<00:03:42.550> didn't<00:03:42.850> get<00:03:42.940> a<00:03:43.000> chance

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
and I'm malapascua I didn't get a chance

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.000 
and I'm malapascua I didn't get a chance

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
to get on any of the wreck dives but if

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.160 
to get on any of the wreck dives but if
I<00:03:45.100> had<00:03:45.280> done<00:03:45.489> again<00:03:45.850> they<00:03:46.090> were<00:03:46.239> sort<00:03:46.540> of<00:03:46.570> 20<00:03:47.019> to

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
I had done again they were sort of 20 to

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.680 
I had done again they were sort of 20 to
30<00:03:47.380> meters<00:03:47.680> depth<00:03:48.220> say<00:03:48.970> I'm<00:03:49.180> so<00:03:49.390> definitely

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
30 meters depth say I'm so definitely

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.990 
30 meters depth say I'm so definitely
something<00:03:49.930> I<00:03:49.959> recommend<00:03:50.380> doing<00:03:50.500> if<00:03:51.000> you've

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000
