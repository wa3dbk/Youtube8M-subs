00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.810
 general public are often hurt how one of the most beautiful 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.440
 for you 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.019
 a lot 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.019
 for now I 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.600
 how does it 

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:20.819
 then first three weeks were mostly focused on preparing 

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:24.380
 athletic not a lot of game not a lot in tactical work and 

00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:25.399
 especially of 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:26.829
 a big word 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:28.319
 the look 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:30.489
 we will start and 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.269
 the settings I just wanted we'll do a first set up the agent 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:37.019
 match Saturday and Sunday in the sand can make one last 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:38.780
 membership review 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.420
 and I will take advantage of the two games the following to be able to set up a 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.670
 game diagram 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.710
 so that the choice of players more recognize at the right time for this 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.900
 do it under certain circumstances 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.220
 so now if you want the preparation and is practically over 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.090
 he said condemning the attacker really has the ball 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.340
 and so I will really ask for huge investment 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.960
 all players to join 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.550
 I was home 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.920
 glasgow nonsense in management 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.360
 in one of the most beautiful 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.340
 for me it was mostly girl's match 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.950
 given that 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.790
 already private in the garden in the club I will obviously know his 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.990
 players before putting a taktika machine in place 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.670
 so it's mostly 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.940
 the two competent crews practically 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.000
 so on the first match she 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.630
 it was very very encouraging because the players knew how to get 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.040
 level of luchon 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.010
 what motivates the luÃ§on what is really a club of 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.690
 who were recognized or in cfa and there we ting tings disillusionment against 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.120
 saumur 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.490
 he is what would he be flattering for 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.210
 moreover I think that 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.650
 defeat is defeat and is logical but maybe not 3 0 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.050
 modise of satisfaction are especially 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.270
 their life the determination designed 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.910
 show them the players 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.120
 the afternoon these are mostly settings 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.580
 and after a little bit of rest there 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.010
 to play at that level knowing that the higher you get in the level 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.220
 more the 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.169
 it's the difference is about the details 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.889
 there we realize that prayer five goals on the five goals have learned 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.919
 three mayor body and the two mistakes two 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:17.329
 individual 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.339
 so that's a lot to be able to claim something at the level 

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:21.939
 so we are here 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.109
 in the learning phase 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:26.469
 seizing 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:28.909
 in one of the most beautiful 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:30.919
 there are still some players who would need 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:32.319
 html5 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.739
 for now we are mostly in the death phases the players I 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.180
 wanted to take on arriving I already managed yesterday 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.059
 to fight them 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:42.799
 to become hours with our tents the adventure 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.099
 so I'm very very happy with the recruitment now if you want to 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.019
 try to tweak it a bit 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.309
 all the players who 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:53.199
 but will strengthen us will come to join us without being especially 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.999
 reinforcement 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:56.489
 we have additional players or players who can 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.319
 in the stride I absolutely want it to be reinforcements so we take our 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.179
 time 

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:02.549
 and for what I had planned 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.779
 originally planned it was great 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:08.159
 a lot of players are content the national after as chef emily and 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:08.869
 manon 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:10.359
 when they are in the process of 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.519
 to go to great lengths to play for you 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.940
 integrated in a cfa 2 so we waited we wait for the opportunity 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:18.799
 people probably no defender 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.539
 we hesitate between 

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:21.919
 still an attacker 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:25.079
 if I never really very good I look at all teams looking for 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.749
 what kind of players 

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:27.979
 an attacker who says 

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:29.499
 ii who take the space 

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:31.619
 and maybe too 

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:34.159
 the defensive midfielder for 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.629
 to be able to overcome bozzetto absence of he put away 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:45.049
 5 8% unfortunately luberon first sex 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:46.249
 understand it 

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:50.569
 to learn at the cfa2 level of course to avoid relegation and to do the 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.459
 best league possible knowing that we are really in a group 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.639
 very very very very complicated with the shac professional reserves and 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.329
 then teams that have 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.900
 very big ambitions like under the wall we show it last saturday 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.060
 and the perry-life of the teams that will play the top of the table the season 

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:06.799
 last and who are in the same group 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.219
 so it's really the same 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:11.619
 to chiraz championship very very hard for us 

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:15.039
 we will try to be up to the task but not to disappoint the head of state
