00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.779
 and there personal of the month the species book 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.990
 touch with the ipad is so to speak of one 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.170
 something very cool there that I 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.410
 I'm not even trying to 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.480
 now that I was going to charge 10% to 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.460
 Charging your tablet 's battery is 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.170
 looking at the ipad 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.359
 and there are people that like I called he lives 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.189
 tablet is so so that's what I say 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.099
 it was not ipad 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.840
 so I said it like that 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.500
 It's been a long time since I've carried him 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.380
 has 10% so I decided to go check the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.750
 time to use it and wait for the 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.940
 ball and looks only personally by the 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.280
 causing both the usually plays staff 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.829
 show you what game the most 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.950
 here I love playing poker online 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.829
 Aquino on the ipad, right? 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.930
 and there are other games there too me too 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.940
 do not play here but really do what 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.910
 prevents me from playing the gameplay with 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.469
 That affection here is the proper accounting and 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.879
 I'll start now, too, afterwards. 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.939
 with which the LG 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.000
 so we see who fits 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:15.200
 We're here in general, we're going out. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:20.040
 the chain use the general we go here in 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.229
 use with the use it will load 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.880
 that storage business of him 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:29.700
 in the clouds, right? 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:32.310
 It is the battery that I use 11 hours and 34 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.420
 minutes time since last recharge 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.130
 complete 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.619
 usually I hope it reaches 20% 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.829
 today was an exception 10% 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.310

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:48.570

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.790
 adored the screen had golden it a 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.340
 much like the apple why 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.440
 I have an ipad too and especially the 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.050
 ipad is calling my attention by 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.090
 be thin because it is light and has a 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.670
 very good processor a screen is 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.040
 excellent and now battery is 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.280
 proving that it is also a very important factor 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.070
 positive on this apple device 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.980
 Congratulations to the time, look again. 11 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.820
 hours and 35 minutes and 17 days on hold 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.160

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.430
 now I will carry'll let him get 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.460
 to 100% for those who do not know 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.290
 usually no I do not know if this 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.230
 happens with other ipads but ipad 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:55.240
 It's if I come here and turn it off personally. 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:57.310
 asks to disconnect from Opel to turn off 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.900
 what happens or is canceled 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:04.780
 I hang beauty put it in the battery 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.940
 on the charger it will call again 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.490
 so that's why I turn off one more 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.310
 event and it stays connected directly even 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.410
 leave a stand by and when it reaches 100% 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.580
 he takes no tech support 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:23.200
 100% personal but very very very and 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:25.000
