of elimination

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.630 
of elimination
I'll<00:02:23.180> guess<00:02:23.480> right<00:02:23.720> one<00:02:23.870> so<00:02:24.080> if<00:02:24.170> I<00:02:24.230> hear<00:02:24.470> it<00:02:24.500> one

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
I'll guess right one so if I hear it one

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.670 
I'll guess right one so if I hear it one
happy<00:02:25.640> birthday<00:02:26.180> doesn't<00:02:27.140> sound<00:02:27.260> right<00:02:27.410> if<00:02:27.560> I

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
happy birthday doesn't sound right if I

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.850 
happy birthday doesn't sound right if I
try<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:27.980> three<00:02:29.829> right<00:02:30.829> or<00:02:31.010> if<00:02:31.070> I<00:02:31.130> try<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.370> five

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
try the three right or if I try the five

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.330 
try the three right or if I try the five
that<00:02:33.860> sounds<00:02:34.160> right<00:02:34.310> so<00:02:34.579> if<00:02:34.670> I<00:02:34.760> know<00:02:34.820> my<00:02:35.030> scale

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
that sounds right so if I know my scale

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.290 
that sounds right so if I know my scale
and<00:02:37.340> I<00:02:37.430> know<00:02:37.489> how<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:37.730> play<00:02:37.880> melodies

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300
