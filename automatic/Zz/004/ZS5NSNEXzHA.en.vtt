00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.269
 you so that you do not spend your 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.639

 and only selected effective today 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.740
 I want to show you a mask for 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.050
 dry and brittle hair based 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.090
 almond oil from chicken yolk 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.760
 the composition of the mask will be included 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.140
 1 chicken yolk and a teaspoon 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.700
 almond oil 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.840
 this mask can be done on dirty hair 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:39.329
 it nourishes the scalp very well and 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:43.559
 split ends for this we 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.149
 mix two components and apply them 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.120
 first to the hair roots 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.530
 rubbing massage movements and then 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.090
 the entire length of this oil is generally ideally 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.239
 suitable for dry hair 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.480
 she feeds them very well that is one thing 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:05.519
 of the best oils 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:08.150
 Massochka almond oil can be 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.280
 add shampoos a couple of droplets 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.030
 air conditioning 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.210
 also almond oil can 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.720
 combing hair dripping a couple of droplets 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.940
 on the comb to the brush and very useful 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.450
 applied clean for those with 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:28.110
 greasy hair before washing 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:32.890
 whom dry hair after washing 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.960
 before drying my hair, so I erased the mask 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.530
 in the guy now I will add some more 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.890

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.780

00:01:50.190 --> 00:02:00.369

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.060
