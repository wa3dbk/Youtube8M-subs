00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello today i will show ender station 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.359
 I did not come up with it, but because this 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.460
 mechanism in america is very strong 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.900
 unwound then I thought you show it 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.730
 and here in Russia 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.769
 however, this mechanism has a small 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.480
 a snag that's why I showed it 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.240
 otherwise you were considered plagiarism 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.920
 however, this mechanism is not used. 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.840
 only for ender pearl but for many 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.670
 other items however they will you 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.960
 be given the size of 16 pieces so let's 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.910
 let's see how it works 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.130
 pretty quickly as you can see we are behind 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.840
 a short time got 16 ender pearl on 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.910
 you can actually put more arrows here 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.380
 and many more things 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.910
 attack let's find out right now how it is 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.010
 build and build this mechanism 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.450
 easy and just started to put here 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.280
 block here torch 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.840
 here two pieces arrested all a 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.700
 repeat with two delay clicks 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.559
 still redstone here block and here 2 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.120
 distributor further here we must 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.820
 gently put the torch 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.070
 one that will be on this block one 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.660
 which is on this if you put the torch 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.579
 nothing will work here 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.660
 well, then we close everything and for 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.670
 Aesthetics matter here in this way 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.840
 then here we put any things that 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.630
 we want well let's say it will be 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.119
 arrows, in principle, with a dumb too 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.409
 it will not be given to you in the amount of 16 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.930
 pieces and check see on up to 16 arrows 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.030
 but eat repeating if i just 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.430
 showed the mechanism i was plagiarized i know 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.770
 how to reduce it here we take show how 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.049
 do this and my version of the mechanism is still 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.030
 much more compact and so and more 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.600
 easier especially put here a piece 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.750
 arrested 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.900
 here torch further blog 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.780
 here torch here button here we will be on 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.780
 click it and here are 2 distributors 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.900
 how nothing is very hard to put 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.730
 especially survival however it is possible and 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.190
 as we see and put thermo here 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.380
 we load our otter first years hiv 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.320
 frames to introduce to my 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.690
 we get in the amount of 6 pieces with the same 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.760
 fast speed however the mechanism became 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.890
 more compact where it can be applied 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.410
 honestly not knowing 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.540
 but maybe the map makers are on the go 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.700
 application let's player rolls 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.910
 potions if that or allowed by fire 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.620
 cast or something else however 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.390
 maybe people who are big 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.640
 fantasy to invent all the same application 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.709
 this mechanism and this is probably all 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.480
 thank you very much for watching don't forget 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.450
