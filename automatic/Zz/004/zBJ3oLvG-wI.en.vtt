is a symbiotic relationship here but

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.000 
is a symbiotic relationship here but
we've<00:01:56.790> also<00:01:56.970> got<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.510> simple<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.500> assisted

so<00:02:56.280> in<00:02:56.580> this<00:02:56.730> hydroponic<00:02:57.209> technique<00:02:57.989> we're

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
so in this hydroponic technique we're

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.280 
so in this hydroponic technique we're
able<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.890> grow<00:02:59.160> completely<00:03:00.150> organic<00:03:00.510> food<00:03:00.959> I

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
able to grow completely organic food I

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.750 
able to grow completely organic food I
got<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.769> tell<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:01.980> Chris<00:03:02.160> I<00:03:02.310> can't<00:03:02.550> believe

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
got to tell you Chris I can't believe

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.330 
got to tell you Chris I can't believe
how<00:03:02.970> simple<00:03:03.269> that<00:03:03.810> looks<00:03:04.140> it<00:03:04.620> is<00:03:04.800> incredibly

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
how simple that looks it is incredibly

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.120 
how simple that looks it is incredibly
simple<00:03:05.640> I<00:03:05.910> used<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.569> grow<00:03:06.860> hydroponically<00:03:07.860> and

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
simple I used to grow hydroponically and

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.400 
simple I used to grow hydroponically and
every<00:03:08.430> day<00:03:08.640> I'd<00:03:08.850> have<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.330> check<00:03:09.540> nutrient

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
every day I'd have to check nutrient

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.490 
every day I'd have to check nutrient
levels<00:03:10.709> and<00:03:10.920> ph's<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.060> adjust<00:03:12.930> things<00:03:13.110> in

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
levels and ph's and and adjust things in

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.320 
levels and ph's and and adjust things in
this<00:03:13.799> system<00:03:14.010> I<00:03:14.370> come<00:03:14.640> out<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:14.910> feed<00:03:15.060> fish

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
this system I come out and feed fish

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.270 
this system I come out and feed fish
twice<00:03:16.019> a<00:03:16.110> day<00:03:16.350> I<00:03:16.470> love<00:03:16.680> that<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:16.980> there's<00:03:17.160> no

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
twice a day I love that and there's no

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.490 
twice a day I love that and there's no
chemicals<00:03:17.730> involved<00:03:18.000> no<00:03:18.239> chemicals<00:03:18.750> well

there's<00:03:19.920> chemicals<00:03:20.519> involved<00:03:20.940> but<00:03:21.180> mmm<00:03:21.660> not

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
there's chemicals involved but mmm not

like we see spraying and yes to buffer
my<00:03:25.470> pH<00:03:25.830> I<00:03:25.980> use<00:03:26.190> a<00:03:26.220> chemical<00:03:26.790> called<00:03:27.000> calcium

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
my pH I use a chemical called calcium

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.930 
my pH I use a chemical called calcium
carbonate<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.410> calcium<00:03:29.160> carbonate<00:03:29.760> has

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
carbonate and calcium carbonate has

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.600 
carbonate and calcium carbonate has
simply<00:03:30.299> ground-up<00:03:30.870> seashells<00:03:31.319> and<00:03:31.860> coral

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
simply ground-up seashells and coral

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.640 
simply ground-up seashells and coral
sand<00:03:32.850> I<00:03:33.060> put<00:03:33.569> that<00:03:33.690> into<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.049> system<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:34.530> so

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
sand I put that into the system and so

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.940 
sand I put that into the system and so
the<00:03:34.769> pH<00:03:34.980> naturally<00:03:35.670> drops<00:03:36.540> low<00:03:36.840> it<00:03:37.319> fizzes

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
the pH naturally drops low it fizzes

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.699 
the pH naturally drops low it fizzes
