oh<00:00:51.390> that's<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.960> mouthful<00:00:52.379> basically<00:00:52.949> the

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
oh that's a mouthful basically the

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.740 
oh that's a mouthful basically the

saying it's not gonna bloom in well leak
and<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.530> many<00:00:55.710> caravans<00:00:56.219> do<00:00:56.520> after<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> year<00:00:57.210> or

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
and so many caravans do after a year or

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.540 
and so many caravans do after a year or
so<00:00:57.510> now<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.350> we<00:00:58.620> can't<00:00:58.890> get<00:00:59.010> under<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> skin

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
so now that we can't get under the skin

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.090 
so now that we can't get under the skin
to<00:00:59.969> see<00:01:00.149> how<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.420> bits<00:01:00.750> are<00:01:00.930> put<00:01:01.109> together<00:01:01.260> but

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
to see how the bits are put together but

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.770 
to see how the bits are put together but
fortunately<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.789> lot<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.180> dealers<00:01:03.600> are

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
fortunately a lot of the dealers are

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.190 
fortunately a lot of the dealers are

well<00:03:51.440> now<00:03:52.440> like<00:03:52.650> most<00:03:52.980> mid<00:03:53.370> kitchens<00:03:53.820> there

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
well now like most mid kitchens there

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.030 
well now like most mid kitchens there
were<00:03:54.120> two<00:03:54.300> sides<00:03:54.630> and<00:03:54.989> you<00:03:55.110> use<00:03:55.350> both<00:03:55.590> really

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
were two sides and you use both really

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.009 
were two sides and you use both really
in<00:03:56.220> concert<00:03:57.000> with<00:03:57.030> each<00:03:57.239> other<00:03:57.480> for<00:03:57.959> instance

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
in concert with each other for instance

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.140 
in concert with each other for instance
over<00:03:58.440> this<00:03:58.680> side<00:03:58.950> we've<00:03:59.220> got<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.670> new<00:03:59.850> type<00:04:00.120> of

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
over this side we've got the new type of

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.660 
over this side we've got the new type of
microwave<00:04:00.930> oven<00:04:01.200> which<00:04:01.320> is<00:04:01.470> low<00:04:01.680> down<00:04:01.890> that's

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
microwave oven which is low down that's

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.430 
microwave oven which is low down that's
so<00:04:02.880> much<00:04:03.030> safer<00:04:03.300> than<00:04:03.540> having<00:04:03.720> one<00:04:03.989> at<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.200> top

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
so much safer than having one at the top

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.410 
so much safer than having one at the top
that<00:04:04.709> might<00:04:04.890> spill<00:04:05.280> things<00:04:05.489> that<00:04:05.970> are<00:04:06.090> boiling

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
that might spill things that are boiling

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.630 
that might spill things that are boiling

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
you've got a nice space there to put

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.110 
you've got a nice space there to put

Trick<00:04:27.690> hotplate<00:04:28.530> as<00:04:28.740> well<00:04:28.980> now<00:04:29.670> on<00:04:29.850> this<00:04:30.030> one<00:04:30.210> I

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
Trick hotplate as well now on this one I

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.760 
Trick hotplate as well now on this one I

here to stop heat causing damage it's

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.580 
here to stop heat causing damage it's
good<00:04:38.400> reason<00:04:38.820> why<00:04:39.000> look<00:04:39.780> we've<00:04:40.080> got<00:04:40.290> all<00:04:40.470> the

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
good reason why look we've got all the

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.980 
good reason why look we've got all the

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
don't understand really why then as we

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.230 
don't understand really why then as we
look<00:05:03.870> next<00:05:04.320> we've<00:05:04.680> got<00:05:04.980> the<00:05:05.190> Thetford<00:05:05.940> fridge

removable top this turns over it can be

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.220 
removable top this turns over it can be
used<00:05:17.610> as<00:05:17.880> a<00:05:17.910> sort<00:05:18.240> of<00:05:18.300> a<00:05:18.390> chopping<00:05:18.810> board<00:05:19.020> I

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
used as a sort of a chopping board I

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.860 
used as a sort of a chopping board I
gather<00:05:19.500> but<00:05:20.460> it<00:05:20.550> can<00:05:20.760> also<00:05:20.910> be<00:05:21.120> positioned

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
gather but it can also be positioned

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.960 
gather but it can also be positioned
with<00:05:22.050> a<00:05:22.080> slight<00:05:22.500> incline<00:05:22.980> so<00:05:23.490> that<00:05:23.640> the<00:05:23.760> water

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
with a slight incline so that the water

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.820 
with a slight incline so that the water
discharges<00:05:24.870> from<00:05:24.990> the<00:05:25.170> dishes<00:05:25.530> that<00:05:25.710> are

discharges from the dishes that are

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.780 
discharges from the dishes that are
there<00:05:26.120> into<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.240> sink<00:05:27.830> nice<00:05:28.830> tap<00:05:29.190> from<00:05:29.520> whale

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
there into the sink nice tap from whale

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.170 
there into the sink nice tap from whale
and<00:05:30.350> that<00:05:31.350> really<00:05:31.710> completes<00:05:32.190> what<00:05:32.760> is<00:05:32.940> a

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
and that really completes what is a
