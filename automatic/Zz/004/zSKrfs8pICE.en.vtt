haven't seen some of the stuff in my
collection<00:04:15.269> let's<00:04:16.269> see<00:04:16.390> those<00:04:16.510> we<00:04:16.690> got<00:04:16.840> here

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
collection let's see those we got here

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.060

so all our movies look great you can

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.980 
so all our movies look great you can
arrange<00:04:21.310> them<00:04:21.519> in<00:04:21.880> grid<00:04:22.180> like<00:04:22.390> this<00:04:22.420> you<00:04:22.840> can

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
arrange them in grid like this you can

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.920 
arrange them in grid like this you can
arrange<00:04:23.200> them<00:04:23.320> by<00:04:23.350> details<00:04:23.950> like<00:04:24.280> this<00:04:24.930> you

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
arrange them by details like this you

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.710 
arrange them by details like this you
can<00:04:26.050> go<00:04:26.170> with<00:04:26.290> a<00:04:26.350> list<00:04:26.710> but<00:04:27.520> this<00:04:28.030> is<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.450> grid

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
can go with a list but this is the grid

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.920 
can go with a list but this is the grid
the<00:04:29.290> grid<00:04:29.320> layout<00:04:30.010> is<00:04:30.250> just<00:04:30.760> this<00:04:31.120> just<00:04:31.390> is<00:04:31.690> so

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
the grid layout is just this just is so

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.580 
the grid layout is just this just is so
succinct<00:04:32.380> and<00:04:32.710> playing<00:04:33.640> and<00:04:34.590> straightforward

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
succinct and playing and straightforward

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.770 
succinct and playing and straightforward
and<00:04:35.890> there's<00:04:36.070> there's<00:04:36.520> just<00:04:36.700> no<00:04:36.820> there's<00:04:37.690> an

and there's there's just no there's an
obfuscation<00:04:38.320> like<00:04:38.650> there<00:04:38.800> is<00:04:38.919> with<00:04:38.950> XBMC<00:04:39.460> you

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
obfuscation like there is with XBMC you

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.780 
obfuscation like there is with XBMC you

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
this isn't this pretty either but this
