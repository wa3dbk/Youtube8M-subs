this<00:01:38.430> then<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.390> next<00:01:39.420> thing<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.750> you're

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
this then the next thing that you're

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.080 
this then the next thing that you're
going<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.290> do<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.070> are<00:01:41.100> going<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.640> try<00:01:42.060> to

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
going to do is you are going to try to

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.870 
going to do is you are going to try to
kind<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.720> curl<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.619> into<00:01:44.130> like<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.520> ball

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
kind of curl it in into like a ball

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.289 
kind of curl it in into like a ball
shaped<00:01:45.299> form<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.110> then<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.850> should<00:01:48.060> look

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
shaped form and then it should look

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.210 
shaped form and then it should look
something<00:01:48.630> like<00:01:48.810> this<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.649> basically<00:01:49.799> you

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
something like this so basically you

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.730 
something like this so basically you
just<00:01:50.280> want<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.610> create<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.180> ball<00:01:51.570> shaped<00:01:52.079> form

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
just want to create a ball shaped form

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.859 
just want to create a ball shaped form
and<00:01:53.040> then<00:01:53.640> basically<00:01:54.299> when<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.840> are

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
and then basically when you are

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.060 
and then basically when you are
threading<00:01:55.439> you're<00:01:55.710> curled<00:01:56.670> into<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.420> wire

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
threading you're curled into the wire

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.530 
threading you're curled into the wire
the<00:01:59.070> pearls<00:01:59.369> will<00:01:59.610> not<00:01:59.790> fall<00:02:00.090> out<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:03.240> then<00:02:03.450> the

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
the pearls will not fall out so then the

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.910 
the pearls will not fall out so then the
next<00:02:03.719> thing<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.140> are<00:02:04.170> going<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.619> do<00:02:04.770> is

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
next thing that you are going to do is

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.679 
next thing that you are going to do is
you're<00:02:05.100> going<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.399> take<00:02:05.579> your<00:02:05.759> noodle<00:02:06.180> tire<00:02:06.450> or

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
you're going to take your noodle tire or

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.240 
you're going to take your noodle tire or
your<00:02:06.840> scissors<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.290> then<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.740> are<00:02:07.890> going<00:02:08.129> to

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
your scissors and then you are going to

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.889 
your scissors and then you are going to
cut<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.580> wire<00:02:08.610> but<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.209> don't<00:02:09.479> want<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.720> cut

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
cut the wire but you don't want to cut

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.150 
cut the wire but you don't want to cut
too<00:02:09.929> much<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.679> wire

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.730 

so<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.700> attach<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.510> purl<00:02:14.750> on<00:02:14.960> to<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.260> fabric

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
so to attach the purl on to the fabric

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.110 
so to attach the purl on to the fabric
you<00:02:15.920> are<00:02:16.130> going<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.490> take<00:02:16.640> your<00:02:16.760> strip<00:02:17.000> of

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
you are going to take your strip of

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.670 
you are going to take your strip of
fabric<00:02:17.270> and<00:02:17.660> then<00:02:17.750> you<00:02:17.870> are<00:02:18.110> going<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:18.440> take

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
fabric and then you are going to take

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.870 
fabric and then you are going to take
your<00:02:18.830> wire<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:19.040> then<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:19.550> are<00:02:19.670> going<00:02:19.820> to

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
your wire and then you are going to

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.150 
your wire and then you are going to
thread<00:02:20.180> it<00:02:20.300> into<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.690> fabric<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:21.740> then<00:02:22.010> you

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
thread it into the fabric and then you

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.270 
thread it into the fabric and then you
are<00:02:22.370> going<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:22.910> bend<00:02:23.300> that<00:02:23.960> wire<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:24.950> then<00:02:25.160> you

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
are going to bend that wire and then you

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.920 
are going to bend that wire and then you
are<00:02:25.430> going<00:02:25.580> to<00:02:25.670> take<00:02:25.910> that<00:02:26.090> extra<00:02:26.330> piece<00:02:26.780> of

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
are going to take that extra piece of

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.780 
are going to take that extra piece of
wire<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.530> then<00:02:27.860> you<00:02:27.950> are<00:02:28.040> going<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.310> wrap<00:02:28.760> it

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
wire and then you are going to wrap it

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.090 
wire and then you are going to wrap it
around<00:02:28.970> itself<00:02:30.160> just<00:02:31.160> like<00:02:31.460> that<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:32.680> then<00:02:33.680> if

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
around itself just like that and then if

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.180

then you're just gonna make it better

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.920 
then you're just gonna make it better
and<00:02:46.670> then<00:02:46.880> this<00:02:47.180> how<00:02:47.390> it<00:02:47.540> should<00:02:47.690> look<00:02:47.780> like

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
and then this how it should look like

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.400 
and then this how it should look like
yeah<00:02:49.270> so<00:02:50.270> then<00:02:50.480> you<00:02:50.660> want<00:02:50.810> to<00:02:50.870> make<00:02:51.020> a<00:02:51.050> shape

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
yeah so then you want to make a shape

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.680 
yeah so then you want to make a shape
like<00:02:51.620> this<00:02:51.680> on<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.250> bottom<00:02:52.550> of<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:53.150> lace<00:02:53.390> and

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
like this on the bottom of the lace and

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.210 
like this on the bottom of the lace and
basically<00:02:54.320> the<00:02:54.560> reason<00:02:54.590> why<00:02:54.920> you<00:02:54.980> want<00:02:55.130> to

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
basically the reason why you want to

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.920 
basically the reason why you want to
make<00:02:55.400> a<00:02:55.430> shape<00:02:55.580> like<00:02:55.910> this<00:02:55.970> is<00:02:56.330> because<00:02:56.720> it's

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
make a shape like this is because it's

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.680 
make a shape like this is because it's
going<00:02:57.110> to<00:02:57.200> be<00:02:57.350> your<00:02:57.530> reference<00:02:57.890> guide<00:02:58.250> on

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
going to be your reference guide on

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.950 
going to be your reference guide on
where<00:02:59.690> you<00:02:59.900> are<00:03:00.110> going<00:03:00.290> to<00:03:00.440> put<00:03:00.650> your<00:03:00.770> purl

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
where you are going to put your purl

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.760 
where you are going to put your purl
later<00:03:02.960> on<00:03:04.240> so<00:03:05.240> after<00:03:05.630> creating<00:03:06.020> that<00:03:06.290> shape<00:03:06.560> on

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
later on so after creating that shape on

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.240 
later on so after creating that shape on
the<00:03:06.950> bottom<00:03:07.370> of<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.700> lace<00:03:07.910> you<00:03:08.150> are<00:03:08.360> going<00:03:08.810> to

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
the bottom of the lace you are going to

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.850 
the bottom of the lace you are going to
make<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.280> strand<00:03:10.910> pearl<00:03:11.420> and<00:03:11.840> you<00:03:12.380> are<00:03:12.560> going<00:03:12.770> to

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
make a strand pearl and you are going to

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.800 
make a strand pearl and you are going to
attach<00:03:13.310> it<00:03:13.370> onto<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.940> top<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.510> reason

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
attach it onto the top and the reason

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.330 
attach it onto the top and the reason
why<00:03:14.900> you<00:03:14.960> want<00:03:15.110> to<00:03:15.260> attach<00:03:15.470> it<00:03:15.650> onto<00:03:15.800> the<00:03:16.100> top

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
why you want to attach it onto the top

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.300 
why you want to attach it onto the top
is<00:03:16.550> because<00:03:16.730> when<00:03:17.570> you<00:03:17.870> hold<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:18.740> lace<00:03:18.950> it's

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
is because when you hold the lace it's

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.090 
is because when you hold the lace it's
going<00:03:19.670> to<00:03:19.790> fold<00:03:20.120> over<00:03:20.300> and<00:03:20.900> then<00:03:20.990> it<00:03:21.830> should

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
going to fold over and then it should

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.780 
going to fold over and then it should
look<00:03:22.280> something<00:03:22.670> that<00:03:22.700> looks<00:03:23.060> like<00:03:23.120> this<00:03:23.540> so

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
look something that looks like this so
