then<00:02:25.730> well<00:02:26.730> definitely<00:02:27.390> better<00:02:27.599> than<00:02:27.720> the

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
then well definitely better than the

the<00:04:21.430> first<00:04:21.609> time<00:04:21.820> you<00:04:21.940> do<00:04:22.090> it<00:04:22.120> and<00:04:22.419> if<00:04:22.540> you're

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
the first time you do it and if you're

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.570 
the first time you do it and if you're
in<00:04:22.840> an<00:04:22.960> app<00:04:23.110> it<00:04:23.290> tends<00:04:23.530> to<00:04:23.710> lag<00:04:23.889> sometimes<00:04:24.430> I'll

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
in an app it tends to lag sometimes I'll

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.060 
in an app it tends to lag sometimes I'll
lose<00:04:24.760> my<00:04:24.790> background<00:04:25.360> momentarily<00:04:25.889> but<00:04:26.889> then

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
lose my background momentarily but then

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.250 
lose my background momentarily but then
once<00:04:27.280> you've<00:04:27.400> done<00:04:27.550> it<00:04:27.610> a<00:04:27.790> few<00:04:27.820> times<00:04:28.260> it'll

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
once you've done it a few times it'll

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.320 
once you've done it a few times it'll
catch<00:04:29.530> up<00:04:29.740> with<00:04:29.919> itself<00:04:30.280> but<00:04:30.850> again<00:04:31.120> that's

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
catch up with itself but again that's

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.969 
catch up with itself but again that's
just<00:04:31.570> if<00:04:31.690> you're<00:04:31.840> turning<00:04:32.350> it<00:04:32.440> back<00:04:32.560> and<00:04:32.770> forth

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
just if you're turning it back and forth

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:36.000 
just if you're turning it back and forth
over<00:04:33.250> and<00:04:33.550> over<00:04:33.639> in<00:04:34.330> general<00:04:34.780> for<00:04:35.229> first<00:04:35.740> time

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:42.090 
over and over in general for first time
turning<00:04:36.460> it's<00:04:36.760> still<00:04:37.600> going<00:04:37.780> to<00:04:37.840> lag<00:04:41.100> and

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
turning it's still going to lag and

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.070 
turning it's still going to lag and
let's<00:04:42.370> find<00:04:42.760> where<00:04:43.210> the<00:04:43.389> screen<00:04:43.720> pinning

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
let's find where the screen pinning

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:51.120 
let's find where the screen pinning
option<00:04:44.590> is<00:04:44.919> not<00:04:45.580> in<00:04:45.850> display<00:04:48.900> here<00:04:49.900> we<00:04:50.020> go<00:04:50.200> so

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
option is not in display here we go so

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.650 
option is not in display here we go so
that<00:04:51.490> is<00:04:51.639> the<00:04:51.760> option<00:04:51.910> you'll<00:04:52.240> want<00:04:52.389> to<00:04:52.450> turn

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
that is the option you'll want to turn

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.870 
that is the option you'll want to turn
on<00:04:52.810> for<00:04:53.050> screen<00:04:53.320> pinning<00:04:53.740> it<00:04:54.250> does<00:04:54.460> not<00:04:54.610> come

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
on for screen pinning it does not come

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.790 
on for screen pinning it does not come
turned<00:04:55.150> on<00:04:55.360> out<00:04:55.570> of<00:04:55.660> the<00:04:55.720> box<00:04:55.930> so<00:04:56.470> just<00:04:56.740> go

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
turned on out of the box so just go

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.950 
turned on out of the box so just go
ahead<00:04:56.860> and<00:04:56.979> flip<00:04:57.669> that<00:04:57.880> on<00:04:57.940> and<00:04:58.360> you'll<00:04:58.810> have

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
ahead and flip that on and you'll have

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.450 
ahead and flip that on and you'll have
the<00:04:59.020> option<00:04:59.410> to<00:04:59.440> screen<00:04:59.770> pin<00:04:59.979> like<00:05:00.130> I<00:05:00.250> showed

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
the option to screen pin like I showed

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:10.690 
the option to screen pin like I showed
you<00:05:00.520> a<00:05:00.669> moment<00:05:00.729> ago

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.380 

okay<00:05:11.390> so<00:05:11.810> final<00:05:12.410> thoughts<00:05:12.650> here<00:05:13.130> ever<00:05:13.850> HAP<00:05:14.120> Stu

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
okay so final thoughts here ever HAP Stu

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.510 
okay so final thoughts here ever HAP Stu
open<00:05:14.750> okay<00:05:15.110> and<00:05:15.410> sometimes<00:05:16.040> they<00:05:16.250> lag<00:05:16.490> a

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
open okay and sometimes they lag a

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.950 
open okay and sometimes they lag a
little<00:05:16.880> bit<00:05:17.060> so<00:05:17.270> it<00:05:17.450> is<00:05:17.570> a<00:05:17.600> little<00:05:17.780> bit

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
little bit so it is a little bit

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.690 
little bit so it is a little bit
surprising<00:05:18.410> to<00:05:18.650> see<00:05:18.830> this<00:05:19.010> as<00:05:19.070> a<00:05:19.250> release<00:05:19.550> from

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
surprising to see this as a release from

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.070 
surprising to see this as a release from
google<00:05:20.090> I<00:05:20.180> would<00:05:20.360> have<00:05:20.450> thought<00:05:20.630> that<00:05:20.690> it'd<00:05:20.930> be

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
google I would have thought that it'd be

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.980 
google I would have thought that it'd be
a<00:05:21.290> little<00:05:21.800> bit<00:05:21.950> snappier<00:05:22.460> than<00:05:22.520> it<00:05:22.820> was<00:05:23.000> but<00:05:23.750> as

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
a little bit snappier than it was but as

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.290 
a little bit snappier than it was but as
I<00:05:24.710> said<00:05:24.770> when<00:05:25.310> I'm<00:05:25.430> comparing<00:05:25.820> it<00:05:26.060> to<00:05:26.090> the

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
I said when I'm comparing it to the

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.230 
I said when I'm comparing it to the
source<00:05:26.990> built<00:05:27.290> roms<00:05:27.560> that<00:05:27.920> I've<00:05:28.040> used<00:05:28.240> the

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
source built roms this is just blows

them<00:05:36.110> out<00:05:36.230> of<00:05:36.290> the<00:05:36.410> park<00:05:36.650> it's<00:05:36.890> so<00:05:37.160> much<00:05:37.310> better

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490

another<00:05:38.240> interesting<00:05:38.450> thing<00:05:38.840> here<00:05:39.530> is<00:05:39.680> when

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
another interesting thing here is when

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.400 
another interesting thing here is when
you<00:05:40.130> use<00:05:40.160> the<00:05:40.550> tap<00:05:40.850> to<00:05:41.030> go<00:05:41.180> where<00:05:41.810> you<00:05:42.080> just

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
you use the tap to go where you just

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.490 
you use the tap to go where you just
take<00:05:43.040> two<00:05:43.970> devices<00:05:44.300> and<00:05:44.720> tap<00:05:45.020> them<00:05:45.200> together

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
take two devices and tap them together

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.460 
take two devices and tap them together
with<00:05:45.710> NFC<00:05:46.370> at<00:05:47.180> like<00:05:47.420> so<00:05:47.690> during<00:05:48.170> the<00:05:48.260> setup

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
with NFC at like so during the setup

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.770 
with NFC at like so during the setup
process<00:05:48.740> it<00:05:49.490> will<00:05:49.850> actually<00:05:50.060> this<00:05:50.570> is<00:05:50.750> the

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
process it will actually this is the

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.930 
process it will actually this is the
