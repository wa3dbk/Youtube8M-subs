of tag in and then we're going to go to

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.560 
of tag in and then we're going to go to
rotate<00:01:26.000> it<00:01:26.210> towards<00:01:27.460> towards<00:01:28.460> your<00:01:28.790> main<00:01:29.329> line

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
rotate it towards towards your main line

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.910 
rotate it towards towards your main line
so<00:01:30.350> you're<00:01:30.470> going<00:01:30.590> to<00:01:30.619> go<00:01:30.740> one<00:01:31.060> two<00:01:32.060> three<00:01:34.299> four

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
so you're going to go one two three four

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.910 
so you're going to go one two three four
five<00:01:37.180> we'll<00:01:38.180> do<00:01:38.329> six<00:01:38.689> this<00:01:39.229> is<00:01:39.409> thirty<00:01:39.649> pound

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
five we'll do six this is thirty pound

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.639 
five we'll do six this is thirty pound
test<00:01:40.040> so<00:01:40.820> six<00:01:41.450> is<00:01:41.600> usually<00:01:41.930> more<00:01:42.110> than<00:01:42.170> enough

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
test so six is usually more than enough

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.350 
test so six is usually more than enough
you're<00:01:43.280> going<00:01:43.399> to<00:01:43.490> come<00:01:43.700> back<00:01:43.969> through

I'm through the loop I'm back through

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.170 
I'm through the loop I'm back through
start<00:03:56.879> to<00:03:57.060> straighten<00:03:57.599> it<00:03:57.750> out<00:03:57.930> let<00:03:58.230> it<00:03:58.260> twist

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
in and just let it pop down you have to

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.910 
in and just let it pop down you have to
get<00:04:12.359> to<00:04:12.510> pull<00:04:12.720> with<00:04:12.870> your<00:04:12.989> hands<00:04:13.319> pull<00:04:13.560> down<00:04:13.769> on

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
get to pull with your hands pull down on

an<00:04:14.069> ox<00:04:14.250> eat<00:04:14.670> it<00:04:14.819> but<00:04:15.450> you<00:04:15.569> got<00:04:15.750> to<00:04:15.870> make<00:04:15.989> sure

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
an ox eat it but you got to make sure

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.890 
an ox eat it but you got to make sure
it's<00:04:16.289> seats<00:04:16.590> so<00:04:17.340> it<00:04:17.489> won't<00:04:17.639> pull<00:04:17.850> itself<00:04:18.150> out

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.930 

so<00:04:21.900> there<00:04:22.049> you<00:04:22.169> go<00:04:22.289> now<00:04:23.280> it<00:04:23.460> gives<00:04:23.610> a<00:04:23.789> little

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
bit of moving on air you really don't

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.010 
bit of moving on air you really don't
need

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020
