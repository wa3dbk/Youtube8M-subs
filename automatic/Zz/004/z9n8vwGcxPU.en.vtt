have here tones but are like other
stable<00:01:54.130> tongs<00:01:55.000> that<00:01:55.360> when<00:01:55.570> I<00:01:55.720> rotate<00:01:56.140> I<00:01:56.409> can<00:01:57.010> do

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
stable tongs that when I rotate I can do

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.110 
stable tongs that when I rotate I can do
this

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
this

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.260 
this
length<00:01:59.050> in<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.590> Atlanta<00:02:00.100> it<00:02:00.250> is<00:02:00.460> now<00:02:00.670> big<00:02:01.000> or

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
length in the Atlanta it is now big or

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.340 
length in the Atlanta it is now big or
10<00:02:01.870> that<00:02:02.500> is<00:02:02.650> more<00:02:02.980> and<00:02:03.280> and<00:02:03.909> in<00:02:04.300> that<00:02:04.570> point<00:02:04.930> my

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
idea is that that I compress and press I

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.860 
idea is that that I compress and press I
use<00:02:11.080> my<00:02:11.379> tongs<00:02:11.709> in<00:02:12.040> here<00:02:12.370> and<00:02:12.849> I<00:02:13.180> insert<00:02:13.690> that

just feel right cause then then I check
that<00:03:05.340> is<00:03:05.549> this<00:03:05.760> my<00:03:06.000> whole<00:03:06.329> enough<00:03:06.810> peak<00:03:07.250> that

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
that is this my whole enough peak that

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.580 
that is this my whole enough peak that
this<00:03:08.549> chain<00:03:09.000> can<00:03:09.389> be<00:03:09.420> called<00:03:09.870> true<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.470> I

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
this chain can be called true and I

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.520 
this chain can be called true and I
think<00:03:10.620> that<00:03:11.159> this<00:03:11.760> is<00:03:11.970> not<00:03:12.209> enough<00:03:12.599> big<00:03:12.959> and<00:03:13.319> I

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
think that this is not enough big and I

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.379 
think that this is not enough big and I
need<00:03:13.829> a<00:03:14.040> little<00:03:14.489> bit<00:03:14.790> bigger<00:03:15.349> drill<00:03:16.349> pipe<00:03:16.709> next

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
need a little bit bigger drill pipe next

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.699 
need a little bit bigger drill pipe next
okay<00:03:18.389> and<00:03:18.540> here<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:18.750> have<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.200> little<00:03:19.470> bit

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
okay and here I have a little bit

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.119 
okay and here I have a little bit
thicker<00:03:20.129> applied<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:21.989> pipe<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.500> I<00:03:22.620> opened

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
thicker applied to the pipe and I opened

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:28.280 
thicker applied to the pipe and I opened
up<00:03:23.310> my<00:03:23.609> bill<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.480> I<00:03:25.230> insert<00:03:25.980> new<00:03:27.079> york<00:03:28.079> real

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
up my bill and I insert new york real

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.470 
up my bill and I insert new york real
part<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:28.919> then<00:03:29.879> fly<00:03:30.359> and<00:03:30.690> i<00:03:31.519> think<00:03:32.519> that<00:03:32.760> i<00:03:32.970> do

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
part and then fly and i think that i do

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:44.720 
part and then fly and i think that i do
new<00:03:33.750> hole<00:03:34.079> in<00:03:34.349> here<00:03:35.419> that<00:03:36.419> are<00:03:36.690> ram

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.449 

okay<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:47.609> now<00:03:48.609> there<00:03:48.939> is<00:03:48.969> peak<00:03:50.010> kicker<00:03:51.010> hole

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
okay and now there is peak kicker hole

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.750 
okay and now there is peak kicker hole
and<00:03:51.790> then<00:03:52.060> I<00:03:52.269> think<00:03:52.569> that<00:03:52.840> can<00:03:53.829> I<00:03:53.980> insert<00:03:54.549> this

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
and then I think that can I insert this

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.569 
and then I think that can I insert this
my<00:03:55.030> key<00:03:55.590> for<00:03:56.590> this<00:03:56.739> entire<00:03:58.109> life<00:03:59.109> that<00:04:00.069> is<00:04:00.219> key

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
my key for this entire life that is key

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:07.289 
my key for this entire life that is key
