with<00:04:14.459> fitting<00:04:15.060> in<00:04:15.150> there<00:04:15.239> backwards<00:04:15.720> I<00:04:15.840> know

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
with fitting in there backwards I know

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.259 
with fitting in there backwards I know
on<00:04:16.229> the<00:04:16.440> otterbox<00:04:17.070> case<00:04:17.370> for<00:04:17.640> example<00:04:17.729> you

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
on the otterbox case for example you

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.570 
on the otterbox case for example you
have<00:04:18.840> no<00:04:19.140> choice<00:04:19.440> but<00:04:19.470> to<00:04:19.859> have<00:04:19.950> it<00:04:20.010> backwards

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
have no choice but to have it backwards

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.330 
have no choice but to have it backwards
which<00:04:20.880> is<00:04:21.060> fine<00:04:21.440> and<00:04:22.440> a<00:04:22.590> good<00:04:22.770> idea<00:04:23.070> because

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
which is fine and a good idea because

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.550 
which is fine and a good idea because
rough<00:04:24.270> environment<00:04:24.419> you<00:04:24.990> could<00:04:25.169> probably<00:04:25.320> see

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
rough environment you could probably see

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.260 
rough environment you could probably see
my<00:04:25.680> case<00:04:25.890> is<00:04:26.070> pretty<00:04:26.310> filthy<00:04:26.520> because<00:04:26.910> I<00:04:27.030> put
