00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
year there's a brand new slip float on

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.950 
year there's a brand new slip float on
the<00:00:57.649> market<00:00:58.010> called<00:00:58.310> the<00:00:58.700> light<00:00:58.970> white<00:00:59.450> slip

the market called the light white slip

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.500 
the market called the light white slip
float<00:01:00.230> and<00:01:00.440> this<00:01:00.680> is<00:01:00.860> gonna<00:01:01.130> be<00:01:01.399> the<00:01:01.940> greatest

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
float and this is gonna be the greatest

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.649 
float and this is gonna be the greatest
ice<00:01:02.750> fishing<00:01:03.230> float<00:01:03.649> ever<00:01:04.089> and<00:01:05.089> let<00:01:05.390> me<00:01:05.479> show

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
ice fishing float ever and let me show

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.359 
ice fishing float ever and let me show
you<00:01:05.720> why<00:01:05.960> I<00:01:05.990> mean<00:01:06.320> obviously<00:01:06.470> it's<00:01:07.009> a<00:01:07.100> slip

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
you why I mean obviously it's a slip

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.309 
you why I mean obviously it's a slip
float<00:01:07.640> so<00:01:07.880> you<00:01:07.939> can<00:01:08.210> use<00:01:08.389> a<00:01:08.420> bobber<00:01:08.719> stop<00:01:09.079> and

00:01:09.309 --> 00:01:09.319 
float so you can use a bobber stop and

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:10.419 
float so you can use a bobber stop and
it's<00:01:09.409> going<00:01:09.530> to<00:01:09.590> go<00:01:09.710> right<00:01:09.920> back<00:01:10.069> to<00:01:10.130> that

00:01:10.419 --> 00:01:10.429 
it's going to go right back to that

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:12.609 
it's going to go right back to that
desired<00:01:11.109> desired<00:01:12.109> depth<00:01:12.380> that<00:01:12.499> you're

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
desired desired depth that you're

here's the coolest part for the first
time<00:01:42.950> in<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:43.159> world<00:01:43.340> ice<00:01:43.579> fishermen<00:01:43.999> we<00:01:44.090> can

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
time in the world ice fishermen we can

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.859 
time in the world ice fishermen we can
now<00:01:44.590> detach<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:46.369> float<00:01:46.670> from<00:01:47.270> this

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
now detach the float from this

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.349 
now detach the float from this
slip-and-slide<00:01:48.679> corkscrew<00:01:49.520> float<00:01:49.849> base<00:01:50.090> and

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:50.359 
slip-and-slide corkscrew float base and

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:52.300 
slip-and-slide corkscrew float base and
what's<00:01:50.810> neat<00:01:50.990> about<00:01:51.020> that<00:01:51.289> is<00:01:51.709> you<00:01:52.039> want<00:01:52.279> to

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
what's neat about that is you want to

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.459 
what's neat about that is you want to
adjust<00:01:52.459> the<00:01:52.819> size<00:01:53.029> you're<00:01:53.689> gonna<00:01:53.810> adjust<00:01:54.170> this

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 
adjust the size you're gonna adjust this

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:57.300 
adjust the size you're gonna adjust this
from<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:55.609> bottom<00:01:56.060> up<00:01:56.359> so<00:01:56.659> we<00:01:56.840> want<00:01:56.959> to<00:01:57.109> make<00:01:57.200> a

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
from the bottom up so we want to make a

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.309 
from the bottom up so we want to make a
smaller<00:01:58.310> float<00:01:58.670> for<00:01:58.939> smaller<00:01:59.240> lures<00:01:59.659> cut<00:02:00.169> the

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
smaller float for smaller lures cut the

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:03.730 
smaller float for smaller lures cut the
base<00:02:00.499> off<00:02:00.799> and<00:02:01.359> then<00:02:02.359> screw<00:02:02.779> it<00:02:02.899> right<00:02:03.020> back<00:02:03.380> in

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
base off and then screw it right back in

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.609 
base off and then screw it right back in
to<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.459> corkscrew<00:02:05.029> float<00:02:05.329> base<00:02:05.539> or<00:02:05.810> your

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
to the corkscrew float base or your
