this<00:01:50.790> car<00:01:51.149> does<00:01:52.110> seem<00:01:52.530> like<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.740> very<00:01:53.360> solid

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
this car does seem like a very solid

your<00:01:56.399> garage<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.000> look<00:01:57.509> at<00:01:57.659> those<00:01:57.810> windows

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
your garage and look at those windows

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.340 
your garage and look at those windows
those<00:01:58.770> windows<00:01:59.189> are<00:01:59.719> arguably<00:02:00.719> one<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.229> the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
those windows are arguably one of the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.139 
those windows are arguably one of the
coolest<00:02:01.590> windows<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.340> can<00:02:02.460> possibly<00:02:02.640> have<00:02:02.969> on

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
coolest windows you can possibly have on

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.039 
coolest windows you can possibly have on

setting<00:02:07.409> extra<00:02:07.680> makes<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.069> much<00:02:08.220> cooler

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
setting extra makes it that much cooler

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.249 
setting extra makes it that much cooler
and<00:02:08.819> overall<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:09.660> think<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:09.959> would<00:02:10.170> be<00:02:10.229> a

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
and overall I think this would be a

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.199 
and overall I think this would be a
great<00:02:10.590> addition<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.250> muscle<00:02:11.670> car<00:02:11.819> section

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
great addition to the muscle car section

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:12.760 
great addition to the muscle car section

of<00:02:27.160> Michael<00:02:28.160> walking<00:02:28.550> down<00:02:28.790> I<00:02:29.060> guess<00:02:29.870> his

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
of Michael walking down I guess his

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.310 
of Michael walking down I guess his
backyard<00:02:30.710> and<00:02:31.250> there<00:02:31.880> it<00:02:31.970> is<00:02:32.030> but<00:02:32.450> if<00:02:32.900> you<00:02:33.080> take

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
backyard and there it is but if you take

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.990 
backyard and there it is but if you take
a<00:02:33.350> look<00:02:33.530> closely<00:02:33.860> there<00:02:34.130> is<00:02:34.280> some<00:02:34.550> writing<00:02:34.910> on

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
a look closely there is some writing on

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.020 
a look closely there is some writing on
the<00:02:35.180> wall<00:02:35.420> it<00:02:35.660> says<00:02:35.900> old<00:02:36.170> Fred<00:02:36.830> and<00:02:37.100> then<00:02:37.940> I

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
the wall it says old Fred and then I

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.120 
the wall it says old Fred and then I
believe<00:02:38.330> it<00:02:38.450> says<00:02:39.280> shots<00:02:40.280> aren't<00:02:41.090> nice<00:02:41.920> but<00:02:42.920> it

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
believe it says shots aren't nice but it

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.020 
believe it says shots aren't nice but it
ain't<00:02:43.640> sup<00:02:44.480> I'm<00:02:44.810> not<00:02:45.080> exactly<00:02:45.440> sure<00:02:45.650> if<00:02:46.190> I'm
