00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello today we'll talk about 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.440
 lightroom 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.840
 let's start at least talking about it 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:13.259
 touch electricians and important things like 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.089
 transfer target and speed start with 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.430
 that when you uploaded your 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.779
 photos in the lightroom 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.519
 the first thing you need to do is 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:27.180
 adjust the color i'm in that by default 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:30.119
 lightroom starts attaching profile 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.910
 some kind of incomprehensible ugly here 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.500
 so but you need to fix the light you 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.469
 see now that image 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:42.360
 me some kind of unsaturated enough 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:48.079
 gray tint with you go here is the tab 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:53.670
 develop section rather go here here 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:56.670
 menu camera camera calibration and us 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.070
 Necessary profile and change adob 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.890
 standard on cameras standard look at 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.830
 the image you see the image has become 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.729
 more saturated while gray 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:12.180
 some kind of dullness is gone now 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:17.159
 change to a finger and a little bit lighter 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.759
 make it let's see again something 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.420
 have he been 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:25.110
 and the house standard is also the default 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.670
 This already profile Cameron attracts and we 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.259
 see that the image is already enough 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:34.350
 Itâ€™s interesting to see how everything is here 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.500
 portraits were filmed on a 70200 lens not 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:41.670
 everything is fine but if you shoot on 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:45.689
 fifty dollars 18 or there you rented the interior 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.119
 kuna 1740 then you have one hundred percent 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.649
 the edges of the frame will be vignetting and plus 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.520
 asked to everything will be distorted 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.740
 perspective 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.460
 to fix it all and change and 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.350
 make an image 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.760
 better we need to come here in 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.840
 lens corrections menu 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:07.810
 here here too is on the side of the side 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.660
 Here is this profile button, that is, you have 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.030
 the default menu will probably be 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.910
 here is the profile and put a tick 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:19.150
 enable profile corrections in general 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.100
 look he starts loading profile 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.390
 your lens and accordingly 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.440
 somehow straightens 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.600
 meditation 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:30.700
 and the perspective that is there are special 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.470
 change how I say it again not now 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.610
 will notice but if you use there 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.870
 Cheap lenses changes will be 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.630
 just colossal 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.600
 that is, roughly speaking, to have 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.320
 color here we can adjacent second that we 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.290
 we have now 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.150
 that is, everything is enough just let us 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.760
 do the same with this picture 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.120
 for example here stew here on his 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.269
 profile correction changed a hundred times 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.579
 and here adob standard on camera 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:04.410
 standard and flowered have gotten more 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:07.299
 real and then there are your settings 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:11.440
 what would recommend to do after that 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:13.950
 stand all the photos of this but 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.440
 here sync button sync and 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.600
 sync for sure click 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:24.239
 Case to the bottom of them just scroll 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:26.350
 everything syncs syncs 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.140
 synchronization is now every 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.970
 the image looks like this but when you 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.900
 You may notice that flip over in 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.430
 for a long time it is loaded that is 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.220
 sharpness does not immediately appear because not 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.840
 right away this is why the fact is that when you 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.660
 click 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.370
 click on the photos you have it 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.500
 lightroom means starts 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.060
 create thumbnails thumbnails that is 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.650
 what show you what changes were 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.579
 produced and generally in principle this 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.470
 the photo 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:57.250
 and you need to make these thumbnails 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.180
 to make your computer faster you 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.459
 eat 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:05.319
 section oh took the menu here 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.359
 previews render standard with brought 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.219
 say if you had all the pictures 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:11.469
 are highlighted then he will not ask you 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:13.719
 type create for all rent 1 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:16.930
 Here if you have one photo is 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:19.030
 but selected active then he 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.750
 ask for everyone to create thumbnails 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.250
 not all 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.250
 grieve for everyone 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:33.920
 and what we see after this we perikla 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:37.550
 nod photos they click already 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.860
 quickly and immediately shown all well and 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:46.670
 immediately abruptly with normal colors 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:48.950
 all is well, these are three of these 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.660
 moments that should be done 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.320
 as soon as you upload photos 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.950
 voltron here on this today all thanks 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.950
 for your attention
