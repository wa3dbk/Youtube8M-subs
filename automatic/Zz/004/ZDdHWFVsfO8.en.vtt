00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 Hi everyone guys and welcome in 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.109
 this new video and today I'm t 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.630
 we are back on theories of making them 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.290
 tight in this episode 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.910
 we will clarify things with the timeline 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.000
 updated and hopefully final of 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.510
 fahrenheit freddy's then the first 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.760
 pizzeria and the cold family diner where 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.500
 they are found in golden cold and by what 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.320
 it also looks like golden bones that later 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.179
 will become spring trap 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.949
 so what in this pizzeria? 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.950
 happens it happens that a is killed 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.700
 baby out of the room 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.520
 it happens that a child is killed 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.600
 out of the local that would be exactly it 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.760
 spirit that then owns the marionette 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.879
 after which the owners of the cold for 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:52.800
 family diner must sell the pizzeria 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:56.399
 to the face for entertainment issues 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.250
 just legal and therefore from here 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.820
 we have the first to be fans for 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.840
 spizza which however we do not know is not 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.000
 has not yet occurred in any game in 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.520
 this pizzeria probably takes place 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.670
 the murder of the five children who later 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.280
 will be inserted into the 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.310
 animatronic that are i with her 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.130
 animatronic however in the real ones 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.920
 original condition then when they were 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.040
 still in place 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:33.000
 after which we arrive in 1987 then 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.939
 final software of two with the bite of 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.939
 87 which I think happens in the 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.810
 night 7 so when we use fritz 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:47.130
 smith is bitten during 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.439
 day our friend jeremy fitzgerald 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.829
 so here we have in with her 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.970
 animatronic because they were used for 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.630
 of spare parts 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.750
 only that there is a small detail 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:05.340
 or that if we compare land of 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.640
 that the three of fernet freddy's 2 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.050
 with that of animatronic witte 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.349
 we can see that there are many 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.950
 differences and therefore it is a bit difficult 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:19.080
 understand how they could be used 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.180
 of spare parts since the two 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.190
 Endoskeleton models are 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.860
 completely different 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.230
 so I think the pieces of witte reed 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.110
 animatronic have been used or for 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.810
 repair spring trap that had been put 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.180
 in disuse already for about 40 years or 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.069
 to repair golden colds than to 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.670
 same age as spring trap 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:44.940
 after these events we have the 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:49.349
 pizzeria make you net freddy's 1 then 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.989
 in 1995 in which we say that hewitt 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:55.170
 reading but the process and animatronic 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:58.110
 they are reshaped and therefore we have 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.420
 those we all know while i 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.370
 your animatronic do not know if they are 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.099
 been dismantled or if they are alone 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:09.299
 been set aside in another area 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:13.139
 of the pizzeria after you skip 30 years 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:17.130
 business then the attention of three in the 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:20.569
 horror traction in which the widgets 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:24.269
 animatronic your animatronic 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:27.480
 reappear and reappear under it 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:30.599
 hallucinations form and then have 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.380
 we have spring trap and golden 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:36.690
 cold still active according to me golden 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.480
 cold in finance freddy's train nor 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.760
 a hallucination but a true e 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.489
 own character but like everyone 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.160
 we know cold golden appears e 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.230
 disappears when he wants 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.669
 so in my opinion this is the timeline 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.669
 by fernet freddy's 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.170
 do not follow all these timelines 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.680
 theories that I have done and will not do 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.950
 will obviously make a lot of sense therefore e 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.390
 remember that animatronic hewitt 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.720
 they belong to a pizzeria that is 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.120
 occurred before federation of two but 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.310
 after the cold for female diner then 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.310
 in a pizzeria also named by the foehn 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.400
 guy in fa min councilor of two though 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.810
 we don't know one of you in the 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.290
 comments I think he wrote to me 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.040
 a stuff like that and so apart from that 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.440
 I greet him 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.130
 I also tell him he was right in the 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.530
 minigames 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.410
 as I said, it turned out no 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.510
 I said your animatronic are 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.450
 been dismantled together with fox he dal 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.910
 purple gay 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:46.750
 in fact this is the truth why 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:49.480
 I think the minigames happen first 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.540
 of the opening of the fernet pizzeria 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.840
 freddy's 1 so we know it's the 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:59.440
 place had previously been left in disuse 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:03.280
 for many years later it was bought by 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:06.340
 the friedberg entertainment that has it 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.020
 partially renovated because when we 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.600
 we work we can see that it is a lot 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:14.980
 ruined however it has been renovated 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:17.050
 in part and before the opening and before 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.720
 of the opening just happens this 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.360
 history with the purple guy then second 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.000
 me originally your animatronic 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.390
 they had to be in place of 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.950
 breaded animatronic freddy's one 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:33.790
 just that it is precisely the gaia park 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:36.730
 dismantled and therefore had to for 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:39.660
 force to rebuild others but I'm around 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:42.400
 they are inspired by the animatronic with her 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:45.460
 fox instead was dismantled for 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.770
 I'm wrong because I think the purple gay 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:51.340
 obviously as we can see from the mini 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:54.730
 play in foxy il stradis 2 fragrances 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:57.030
 purple cry when he sees foxy is 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:06:00.900
 very happy then presumably 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:03.780
 foxy and his animatronic and I preferred 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:06.720
 for this in my opinion for paul gray has 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:09.600
 dismantled foxy for an accident 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.570
 obviously no goal was used at 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.190
 foxy place because obviously in the 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.500
 conditions in which it was reduced later 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:19.889
 shoeing of two would definitely have 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:23.550
 scared the children and then saw that 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:26.580
 according to me est is really her that has 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.350
 caused the must of 87 could not 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.289
 allow it to show up again in 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:34.889
 around for fear that he could 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:37.199
 bite someone else then take over 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:40.050
 foxy the new character comes 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:42.900
 dismantled and in my opinion afterwards 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:45.449
 she tries to remedy her mistake 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.850
 reassembling it is in fact how we can 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:50.550
 see from the final four to disp 1 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:53.880
 foxy is incredibly ruined 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:56.900
 also missing pieces of leg stuff here 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:02.639
 and from there then I think 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:04.800
 foxy was disassembled and then reassembled 

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:07.470
 so guys this was all that 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:11.820
 which I have to say on the updated timeline 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:14.370
 plus something I wanted to clarify about 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:18.050
 francis freddy's and of course there will be 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:18.050
 other theories in the next episode
