age

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.600 

I<00:01:59.540> used<00:02:00.380> to<00:02:00.560> define<00:02:00.890> power<00:02:01.610> by<00:02:02.450> age<00:02:02.690> and

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
I used to define power by age and

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.070 
I used to define power by age and
respecting<00:02:04.610> your<00:02:04.700> elders<00:02:04.760> and<00:02:05.540> authority

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
respecting your elders and authority

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.419 
respecting your elders and authority
figures<00:02:06.260> like<00:02:06.740> police<00:02:07.130> and<00:02:07.509> teachers<00:02:08.509> and

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
figures like police and teachers and

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.620 
figures like police and teachers and
people<00:02:10.429> who<00:02:10.520> have<00:02:10.610> kind<00:02:10.729> of<00:02:10.880> told<00:02:11.180> you<00:02:11.330> what<00:02:11.450> to

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
people who have kind of told you what to

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.480 
people who have kind of told you what to
do<00:02:11.780> and<00:02:12.170> then<00:02:12.860> I<00:02:12.950> think<00:02:13.070> it's<00:02:13.190> important<00:02:13.430> to

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
do and then I think it's important to

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.949 
do and then I think it's important to
listen<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.730> that<00:02:13.880> but<00:02:14.060> are<00:02:14.209> known<00:02:14.450> as<00:02:14.630> kind<00:02:14.900> of

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
listen to that but are known as kind of

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.810 
listen to that but are known as kind of
 really<00:02:15.500> are<00:02:15.800> kind<00:02:16.100> of<00:02:16.160> define<00:02:16.520> power

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
 really are kind of define power
