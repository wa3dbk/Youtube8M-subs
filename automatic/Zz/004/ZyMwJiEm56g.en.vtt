establishing habitat and moving towards
central<00:04:57.669> Kentucky<00:04:58.059> and<00:04:58.149> Eastern<00:04:58.240> Kentucky

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
central Kentucky and Eastern Kentucky

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.889 
central Kentucky and Eastern Kentucky
that<00:04:58.929> way<00:04:59.080> we<00:04:59.289> tie<00:05:00.069> in<00:05:00.129> existing<00:05:00.999> populations

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:01.899 
that way we tie in existing populations

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:04.619 
that way we tie in existing populations
of<00:05:02.319> birds<00:05:02.529> and<00:05:02.979> give<00:05:03.759> them<00:05:03.939> additional

00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:04.629 
of birds and give them additional

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:07.139 
of birds and give them additional
habitat<00:05:05.439> and<00:05:05.709> then<00:05:05.919> that<00:05:06.189> enhances<00:05:07.029> the

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:07.149 
habitat and then that enhances the

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:09.779 
habitat and then that enhances the
population<00:05:07.779> faster<00:05:08.259> and<00:05:08.409> better<00:05:08.589> an<00:05:08.860> example

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
population faster and better an example

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:13.139 
population faster and better an example
here<00:05:10.179> is<00:05:10.389> this<00:05:11.169> field<00:05:11.499> here<00:05:11.949> very<00:05:12.669> soon<00:05:12.939> we're

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:13.149 
here is this field here very soon we're

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:15.059 
here is this field here very soon we're
going<00:05:13.270> to<00:05:13.330> burn<00:05:13.689> that<00:05:13.959> off<00:05:14.020> that<00:05:14.529> cover<00:05:14.830> off

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:15.069 
going to burn that off that cover off

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:17.669 
going to burn that off that cover off
and<00:05:15.550> then<00:05:16.179> we're<00:05:16.389> going<00:05:16.539> to<00:05:16.629> probably<00:05:17.199> spray

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:17.679 
and then we're going to probably spray

00:05:17.679 --> 00:05:19.469 
and then we're going to probably spray
it<00:05:17.740> a<00:05:17.860> couple<00:05:18.099> of<00:05:18.219> times<00:05:18.459> with<00:05:18.699> Roundup<00:05:19.209> and

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
it a couple of times with Roundup and

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.899 
it a couple of times with Roundup and
kill<00:05:19.719> any<00:05:20.499> existing<00:05:21.159> things<00:05:21.399> in<00:05:21.639> there<00:05:21.789> and

00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:21.909 
kill any existing things in there and

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:23.639 
kill any existing things in there and
then<00:05:21.999> we're<00:05:22.149> going<00:05:22.269> to<00:05:22.300> sew<00:05:22.599> it<00:05:22.719> in<00:05:22.869> warm

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:23.649 
then we're going to sew it in warm

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:47.730 
then we're going to sew it in warm
