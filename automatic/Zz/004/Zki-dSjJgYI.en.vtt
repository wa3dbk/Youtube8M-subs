00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.520 
took them this long we've been saying it
for<00:05:08.070> I<00:05:08.160> at<00:05:08.550> least<00:05:09.090> the<00:05:09.360> last<00:05:09.510> autumn<00:05:10.110> it's<00:05:10.290> long

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
for I at least the last autumn it's long

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.020 
for I at least the last autumn it's long
when<00:05:10.800> it<00:05:10.890> didn't<00:05:11.280> die<00:05:11.400> a<00:05:11.430> year<00:05:11.580> and<00:05:11.850> a<00:05:11.880> half<00:05:11.910> ago

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
when it didn't die a year and a half ago

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.730 
when it didn't die a year and a half ago
right<00:05:12.630> but<00:05:12.870> what<00:05:12.900> I'm<00:05:13.080> saying<00:05:13.110> is<00:05:13.500> is<00:05:13.710> that

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
right but what I'm saying is is that

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.580 
right but what I'm saying is is that
there<00:05:14.340> was<00:05:14.430> no<00:05:14.670> no<00:05:14.850> Randy<00:05:15.300> Travis<00:05:15.840> well<00:05:16.080> put<00:05:16.530> it

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
there was no no Randy Travis well put it

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.430 
there was no no Randy Travis well put it
this<00:05:16.770> way<00:05:16.950> we<00:05:17.640> both<00:05:17.910> you<00:05:18.480> and<00:05:18.660> I<00:05:18.750> agree<00:05:19.170> that

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
this way we both you and I agree that

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.550 
this way we both you and I agree that
the<00:05:19.710> reason<00:05:20.100> why<00:05:20.280> Paul<00:05:20.790> Barrow<00:05:21.320> likely<00:05:22.320> did

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
the reason why Paul Barrow likely did

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.680 
the reason why Paul Barrow likely did
not<00:05:22.590> go<00:05:23.010> on<00:05:23.040> Hall<00:05:23.370> of<00:05:23.520> Fame<00:05:23.700> sooner<00:05:24.180> was

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
not go on Hall of Fame sooner was

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.900 
not go on Hall of Fame sooner was
because<00:05:25.110> they<00:05:25.320> didn't<00:05:25.740> want<00:05:26.070> the<00:05:26.250> Undertaker

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
because they didn't want the Undertaker

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.300 
because they didn't want the Undertaker
publicly<00:05:27.720> there<00:05:28.050> to<00:05:28.320> induct<00:05:28.710> him<00:05:28.830> for<00:05:29.100> some

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
publicly there to induct him for some

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.250 
publicly there to induct him for some
reason<00:05:29.700> the<00:05:29.790> Undertaker<00:05:30.240> could<00:05:30.510> never<00:05:30.930> go<00:05:31.200> to

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
reason the Undertaker could never go to

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.780 
reason the Undertaker could never go to
a<00:05:31.410> WWE<00:05:32.070> Hall<00:05:32.190> of<00:05:32.220> Famer<00:05:32.660> too<00:05:33.660> much<00:05:33.870> bizarre<00:05:34.830> yes
