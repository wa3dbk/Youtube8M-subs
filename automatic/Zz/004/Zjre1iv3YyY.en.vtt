00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.420 

a<00:02:03.240> couple<00:02:04.240> of<00:02:04.360> things<00:02:04.570> that<00:02:04.630> I<00:02:04.719> noticed<00:02:04.930> I<00:02:05.799> had

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
a couple of things that I noticed I had

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.759 
a couple of things that I noticed I had
a<00:02:06.460> play<00:02:06.729> with<00:02:06.759> the<00:02:07.210> three<00:02:08.140> settings<00:02:08.470> that<00:02:08.739> are

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
a play with the three settings that are

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.440 
a play with the three settings that are
the<00:02:09.009> traction<00:02:09.340> control<00:02:09.369> so<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.300> first

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
the traction control so the first

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.729 
the traction control so the first
setting<00:02:10.780> is<00:02:10.899> with<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.170> Chechen<00:02:11.470> control

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
setting is with the Chechen control

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.330 
setting is with the Chechen control
fully<00:02:12.010> on<00:02:12.280> and<00:02:12.519> I<00:02:13.330> hated<00:02:13.780> it<00:02:13.870> it's<00:02:14.349> just<00:02:15.129> way

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
fully on and I hated it it's just way

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.180 
fully on and I hated it it's just way
too<00:02:15.400> aggressive<00:02:16.030> as<00:02:16.989> soon<00:02:17.230> as<00:02:17.349> the<00:02:17.500> car<00:02:17.769> gets

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
too aggressive as soon as the car gets

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.780 
too aggressive as soon as the car gets
out<00:02:18.730> of<00:02:18.849> shape<00:02:19.000> at<00:02:19.150> all<00:02:19.500> basically<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.890> just

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
out of shape at all basically the just

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.970 
out of shape at all basically the just
to<00:02:22.060> power<00:02:22.450> down<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:22.959> up<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.380> car<00:02:23.590> just<00:02:23.739> dies

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
to power down and up the car just dies

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.860 
to power down and up the car just dies
and<00:02:24.180> can<00:02:25.180> actually<00:02:25.420> be<00:02:25.510> a<00:02:25.540> little<00:02:25.720> bit

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
and can actually be a little bit

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.500 
and can actually be a little bit
dangerous<00:02:26.050> as<00:02:26.410> well<00:02:26.590> if<00:02:26.830> you<00:02:27.069> committed<00:02:27.510> the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
dangerous as well if you committed the

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.110 
dangerous as well if you committed the
next<00:02:28.780> sitting<00:02:29.019> at<00:02:29.110> Scott<00:02:29.380> is<00:02:29.680> with<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.340> sport

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
next sitting at Scott is with the sport

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.289 
next sitting at Scott is with the sport
mode<00:02:31.390> which<00:02:31.930> is<00:02:32.650> designed<00:02:32.890> for<00:02:33.190> race<00:02:33.970> driving

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
mode which is designed for race driving

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.380 
mode which is designed for race driving
and<00:02:34.629> um<00:02:34.870> that<00:02:35.170> was<00:02:35.290> really<00:02:35.530> good<00:02:36.060> for<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.120> novice

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
and um that was really good for a novice

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.720 
and um that was really good for a novice
driver<00:02:37.660> again<00:02:37.930> like<00:02:38.110> myself<00:02:38.319> at<00:02:39.310> least<00:02:39.519> you

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
driver again like myself at least you

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.069 
driver again like myself at least you
give<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.030> car<00:02:40.239> a<00:02:40.269> little<00:02:40.450> bit<00:02:40.599> other<00:02:40.840> side

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
give the car a little bit other side

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.890 
give the car a little bit other side
which<00:02:41.500> is<00:02:41.530> great<00:02:42.090> but<00:02:43.090> I<00:02:43.150> think<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:43.480> took<00:02:43.690> bio

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
which is great but I think it took bio

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.199 
which is great but I think it took bio
to<00:02:44.019> shape<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.470> little<00:02:44.500> hop<00:02:44.860> funk<00:02:45.400> so<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:46.120> gives

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
to shape a little hop funk so it gives

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.030 
to shape a little hop funk so it gives
you<00:02:46.450> quite<00:02:46.930> a<00:02:46.989> lot<00:02:47.049> of<00:02:47.200> confidence<00:02:47.590> which<00:02:47.890> I

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
you quite a lot of confidence which I

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.850 
you quite a lot of confidence which I
like<00:02:48.280> I<00:02:48.489> think<00:02:48.790> in<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.030> rain<00:02:49.239> that<00:02:49.510> have<00:02:49.720> been

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.280 

we<00:02:52.340> then<00:02:52.520> turned<00:02:52.760> it<00:02:52.880> off<00:02:53.000> completely<00:02:53.290> which

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
we then turned it off completely which

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:04.510 
we then turned it off completely which
um<00:02:54.680> give<00:02:55.370> me<00:02:55.400> a<00:02:55.490> little<00:02:55.640> bit<00:02:55.790> scary<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:04.310> car

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
um give me a little bit scary the car

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.280 
um give me a little bit scary the car
isn't<00:03:04.730> hugely<00:03:05.120> powerful<00:03:05.420> so<00:03:05.870> that's<00:03:06.050> probably

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
isn't hugely powerful so that's probably

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.830 
isn't hugely powerful so that's probably
one<00:03:06.770> bonus<00:03:07.190> but<00:03:08.000> that<00:03:08.150> is<00:03:08.300> definitely<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.810> way

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
one bonus but that is definitely the way

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.130 
one bonus but that is definitely the way
to<00:03:08.930> get<00:03:09.170> faster<00:03:09.530> lap<00:03:09.710> times<00:03:10.270> let's<00:03:11.270> the<00:03:11.510> tale

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
to get faster lap times let's the tale

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.600 
to get faster lap times let's the tale
of<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.320> cards<00:03:12.650> is<00:03:12.770> hang<00:03:13.010> out<00:03:13.160> a<00:03:13.190> little<00:03:13.400> bit

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
of the cards is hang out a little bit

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.160 
of the cards is hang out a little bit
unless<00:03:14.120> you<00:03:14.360> get<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.570> power<00:03:14.780> down<00:03:14.840> a<00:03:14.990> little

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
unless you get the power down a little

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:55.860 
unless you get the power down a little
bit<00:03:15.320> earlier<00:03:15.380> coming<00:03:15.950> out<00:03:16.040> of<00:03:16.070> the<00:03:16.190> titans

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.290 

so<00:03:56.870> the<00:03:57.080> end<00:03:57.260> of<00:03:57.410> the<00:03:57.560> day<00:03:57.800> got<00:03:58.730> a<00:03:58.760> best<00:03:59.030> time<00:03:59.240> of

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
so the end of the day got a best time of

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.770 
so the end of the day got a best time of
one<00:03:59.990> minute<00:04:00.020> twenty<00:04:00.940> 6.77<00:04:01.940> what's<00:04:02.420> up<00:04:02.600> I'm

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
one minute twenty 6.77 what's up I'm

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.210 
one minute twenty 6.77 what's up I'm
pretty<00:04:02.990> happy<00:04:03.200> with<00:04:03.319> for<00:04:03.620> a<00:04:03.650> standard<00:04:04.040> car

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
pretty happy with for a standard car

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.400 
pretty happy with for a standard car
pretty<00:04:05.060> sure<00:04:05.300> there's<00:04:05.540> still<00:04:05.720> more<00:04:05.870> time<00:04:06.170> on

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
pretty sure there's still more time on

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.760 
pretty sure there's still more time on
it<00:04:06.550> we've<00:04:07.550> highlighted<00:04:07.850> a<00:04:08.180> few<00:04:08.209> areas<00:04:08.810> that

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
it we've highlighted a few areas that

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.470 
it we've highlighted a few areas that
definitely<00:04:10.220> need<00:04:10.430> some<00:04:10.550> work<00:04:10.730> on<00:04:10.880> the<00:04:11.000> car<00:04:11.209> so

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
definitely need some work on the car so

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.770 
definitely need some work on the car so
the<00:04:11.600> first<00:04:11.810> one<00:04:11.959> is<00:04:12.020> the<00:04:12.590> brakes<00:04:13.180> again<00:04:14.180> not

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
the first one is the brakes again not

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.349 
the first one is the brakes again not
uncommon<00:04:15.230> with<00:04:15.470> a<00:04:15.530> road<00:04:15.770> car<00:04:16.040> we've<00:04:16.730> beat<00:04:17.209> up

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
uncommon with a road car we've beat up

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:18.909 
uncommon with a road car we've beat up
pretty<00:04:17.660> hard<00:04:17.959> on<00:04:18.079> the<00:04:18.169> brakes<00:04:18.320> on<00:04:18.650> a<00:04:18.680> racetrack

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
pretty hard on the brakes on a racetrack

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.600 
pretty hard on the brakes on a racetrack
and<00:04:19.489> I<00:04:20.239> found<00:04:20.660> that<00:04:20.870> about<00:04:21.140> four<00:04:21.739> laps<00:04:22.010> was

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
and I found that about four laps was

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.310 
and I found that about four laps was
about<00:04:22.850> as<00:04:22.970> much<00:04:23.150> as<00:04:23.210> the<00:04:23.480> brakes<00:04:23.720> really<00:04:24.020> took

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
about as much as the brakes really took

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.130 
about as much as the brakes really took
before<00:04:24.680> they<00:04:24.950> started<00:04:25.310> fading<00:04:25.640> so<00:04:26.300> on<00:04:26.570> breaks

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
before they started fading so on breaks

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.720 
before they started fading so on breaks
us<00:04:27.380> one<00:04:27.560> area<00:04:27.830> we<00:04:27.919> definitely<00:04:28.310> need<00:04:28.430> to<00:04:28.460> work

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
us one area we definitely need to work

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.020 
us one area we definitely need to work
on<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:30.110> standard<00:04:30.590> road<00:04:30.770> tires<00:04:31.100> as<00:04:31.340> well<00:04:31.370> after

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
on the standard road tires as well after

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.610 
on the standard road tires as well after
about<00:04:32.210> four<00:04:32.540> or<00:04:32.570> five<00:04:32.690> laps<00:04:33.080> were<00:04:33.260> starting<00:04:33.560> to

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
about four or five laps were starting to

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.960 
about four or five laps were starting to
get<00:04:33.800> a<00:04:33.860> little<00:04:33.950> bit<00:04:34.100> too<00:04:34.340> hot<00:04:34.610> and<00:04:34.730> you<00:04:34.820> can

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
get a little bit too hot and you can

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.280 
get a little bit too hot and you can
feel<00:04:35.180> the<00:04:35.210> car<00:04:35.540> would<00:04:35.720> start<00:04:35.750> squirming

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
feel the car would start squirming

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.320 
feel the car would start squirming
around<00:04:36.560> and<00:04:36.980> getting<00:04:37.580> a<00:04:37.610> little<00:04:37.730> bit<00:04:37.910> unstable

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
around and getting a little bit unstable

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.360 
around and getting a little bit unstable
and<00:04:38.780> on<00:04:39.050> the<00:04:39.350> lap<00:04:39.560> times<00:04:39.860> dropped<00:04:40.190> off

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
and on the lap times dropped off

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.670 
and on the lap times dropped off
accordingly<00:04:40.910> so<00:04:41.180> those<00:04:41.960> are<00:04:42.110> two<00:04:42.140> areas<00:04:42.440> that

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
accordingly so those are two areas that

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.950 
accordingly so those are two areas that
definitely<00:04:43.070> could<00:04:43.310> could<00:04:43.850> do<00:04:43.970> some<00:04:44.180> work<00:04:44.360> but

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
definitely could could do some work but

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.990 
definitely could could do some work but
some<00:04:45.320> for<00:04:46.010> a<00:04:46.040> completely<00:04:46.430> stock<00:04:46.730> standard

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
some for a completely stock standard

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.780 
some for a completely stock standard
road<00:04:47.300> car<00:04:47.510> that's<00:04:47.720> really<00:04:48.140> impressed<00:04:48.620> me<00:04:48.790> it's

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
road car that's really impressed me it's

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.850 
road car that's really impressed me it's
actually<00:04:50.060> blowing<00:04:50.450> my<00:04:50.660> mind<00:04:50.690> and<00:04:51.200> I'm<00:04:51.530> stoked

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
actually blowing my mind and I'm stoked

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.530 
actually blowing my mind and I'm stoked

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
with a look forward to developing it

00:04:53.540 --> 00:05:13.590 
with a look forward to developing it
