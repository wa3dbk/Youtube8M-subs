00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.670 
so what I did was I put that little
piece<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:05.420> look<00:02:06.420> like<00:02:06.450> brain<00:02:06.990> coral<00:02:07.350> right

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
piece of look like brain coral right

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.380 
piece of look like brain coral right
there<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:08.009> i<00:02:08.069> bought<00:02:08.250> at<00:02:08.310> petsmart<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:08.970> put<00:02:09.270> it

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
there that i bought at petsmart I put it

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.089 
there that i bought at petsmart I put it
right<00:02:09.509> there<00:02:09.569> in<00:02:10.229> front<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.619> hole<00:02:10.830> to

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
right there in front of this hole to

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.589 
right there in front of this hole to
make<00:02:11.250> his<00:02:11.489> entrance<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:12.000> little<00:02:12.209> bit<00:02:12.300> smaller

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
make his entrance a little bit smaller

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.410 
make his entrance a little bit smaller
so<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:12.870> only<00:02:13.110> he

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
so that only he

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.970 
so that only he
get<00:02:13.569> in<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:13.810> out<00:02:13.870> of<00:02:13.930> there<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:14.740> not<00:02:14.860> the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
get in and out of there and not the

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.309 
get in and out of there and not the
peacock<00:02:15.340> mantis<00:02:15.550> shrimp<00:02:15.910> but<00:02:16.209> I<00:02:16.510> have<00:02:17.290> a

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
peacock mantis shrimp but I have a

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.630 
peacock mantis shrimp but I have a
feeling<00:02:17.560> that<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.830> peacock<00:02:18.190> had<00:02:18.370> probably

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
feeling that the peacock had probably

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.890 
feeling that the peacock had probably
getting<00:02:18.849> this<00:02:18.910> whole<00:02:19.090> anyway<00:02:19.209> but<00:02:19.630> like<00:02:19.780> I

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
getting this whole anyway but like I

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.030 
getting this whole anyway but like I
said<00:02:19.959> there<00:02:20.290> hasn't<00:02:20.560> been<00:02:20.590> any<00:02:20.800> fighting

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
said there hasn't been any fighting

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.420 
said there hasn't been any fighting
between<00:02:21.280> them<00:02:21.580> I<00:02:22.569> did<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.440> just<00:02:23.709> as<00:02:23.920> just<00:02:24.340> to

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
between them I did that just as just to

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.350 
between them I did that just as just to
make<00:02:24.580> sure<00:02:24.610> that<00:02:24.819> the<00:02:24.910> other<00:02:25.030> one<00:02:25.150> couldn't

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
make sure that the other one couldn't

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.790 
make sure that the other one couldn't
get<00:02:25.510> in<00:02:25.569> there<00:02:25.690> but<00:02:25.840> I<00:02:25.870> didn't<00:02:26.140> do<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.230> I<00:02:26.500> didn't

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
get in there but I didn't do it I didn't

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.050 
get in there but I didn't do it I didn't
do<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:26.890> really<00:02:27.099> good<00:02:27.250> job<00:02:27.280> or<00:02:27.640> anything<00:02:27.819> I<00:02:28.030> just

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
do a really good job or anything I just

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.229 
do a really good job or anything I just
kind<00:02:28.390> of<00:02:28.450> put<00:02:28.599> it<00:02:28.690> there<00:02:29.670> it's<00:02:30.670> basically<00:02:31.120> just

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
kind of put it there it's basically just

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.270 
kind of put it there it's basically just
another<00:02:31.690> tunneling<00:02:32.140> system<00:02:32.590> actually<00:02:33.250> I

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
another tunneling system actually I

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.309 
another tunneling system actually I
didn't<00:02:33.520> even<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:34.120> then<00:02:34.510> I<00:02:34.600> said<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.810> myself<00:02:34.900> oh

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
didn't even and then I said to myself oh

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.280 
didn't even and then I said to myself oh
it<00:02:35.470> could<00:02:35.590> block<00:02:35.800> his<00:02:36.010> hole<00:02:36.220> a<00:02:36.250> little<00:02:36.370> bit<00:02:36.640> too

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
it could block his hole a little bit too

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.330 
it could block his hole a little bit too
like<00:02:38.290> there<00:02:38.440> is<00:02:38.560> another<00:02:38.770> entrance<00:02:39.190> on<00:02:39.310> the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
like there is another entrance on the

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.430 
like there is another entrance on the
other<00:02:39.489> side<00:02:39.700> of<00:02:39.730> this<00:02:39.850> rock<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.300> his<00:02:40.450> hole<00:02:40.630> over

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
other side of this rock to his hole over

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.900 
other side of this rock to his hole over
there<00:02:41.620> in<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:41.860> corner<00:02:42.040> then<00:02:42.340> that<00:02:42.610> could<00:02:42.730> be

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
there in the corner then that could be

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.380 
there in the corner then that could be
dug<00:02:43.120> out<00:02:44.459> but<00:02:45.459> all<00:02:45.610> that's<00:02:45.730> irrelevant<00:02:46.000> that's

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
dug out but all that's irrelevant that's

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.150 
dug out but all that's irrelevant that's
irrelevant<00:02:46.600> I<00:02:46.930> basically<00:02:47.170> put<00:02:47.350> it<00:02:47.560> there<00:02:47.739> so

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
irrelevant I basically put it there so

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.530 
irrelevant I basically put it there so
it<00:02:48.280> was<00:02:48.400> a<00:02:48.519> tunneling<00:02:48.880> system<00:02:49.180> so<00:02:49.330> if<00:02:49.420> he

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
it was a tunneling system so if he

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.790 
it was a tunneling system so if he
wanted<00:02:49.900> to<00:02:49.989> get<00:02:50.080> out<00:02:50.170> of<00:02:50.200> his<00:02:50.319> hole<00:02:50.470> in<00:02:50.620> town

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
wanted to get out of his hole in town

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.170 
wanted to get out of his hole in town
look<00:02:50.950> around<00:02:51.220> and<00:02:51.430> he<00:02:51.519> felt<00:02:51.819> like<00:02:51.850> he<00:02:52.000> couldn't

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
look around and he felt like he couldn't

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.460 
look around and he felt like he couldn't
do<00:02:52.330> that<00:02:52.360> because<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.720> peacock<00:02:53.019> was<00:02:53.170> walking

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
do that because the peacock was walking

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.020 
do that because the peacock was walking
around<00:02:53.560> he<00:02:54.310> could<00:02:54.459> dig<00:02:54.610> underneath<00:02:54.880> that

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
around he could dig underneath that

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.280 
around he could dig underneath that
piece<00:02:55.209> of<00:02:55.360> coral<00:02:55.630> and<00:02:55.750> had<00:02:55.900> some<00:02:56.080> little

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
piece of coral and had some little

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.440 
piece of coral and had some little
grooves<00:02:56.500> underneath<00:02:56.890> it<00:02:57.069> I<00:02:57.280> have<00:02:57.850> a<00:02:58.030> lot<00:02:58.420> of

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
grooves underneath it I have a lot of

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.199 
grooves underneath it I have a lot of
sand<00:02:58.989> in<00:02:59.260> here<00:02:59.680> I<00:02:59.860> mean<00:03:00.489> I<00:03:00.549> literally<00:03:00.819> I<00:03:00.940> have<00:03:01.180> a

sand in here I mean I literally I have a
ton<00:03:01.420> of<00:03:01.450> sand<00:03:01.750> in<00:03:01.989> this<00:03:02.980> aquarium<00:03:03.280> let<00:03:03.880> me<00:03:03.970> look

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
ton of sand in this aquarium let me look

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.880 
ton of sand in this aquarium let me look
at<00:03:04.269> it<00:03:04.299> it's<00:03:04.690> ridiculous<00:03:05.260> how<00:03:05.290> much<00:03:05.530> Sam<00:03:05.709> that

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890

the<00:03:14.470> whole<00:03:14.650> lot<00:03:14.799> of<00:03:14.890> sand<00:03:15.100> once<00:03:15.489> covering<00:03:15.850> that

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
the whole lot of sand once covering that

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.330 
the whole lot of sand once covering that
piece<00:03:16.090> of<00:03:16.120> coral<00:03:16.510> right<00:03:16.630> there<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:18.010> coral

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
piece of coral right there the coral

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.640 
piece of coral right there the coral
look<00:03:18.459> like<00:03:18.670> there's<00:03:18.880> a<00:03:19.150> lot<00:03:19.390> but<00:03:20.260> anyways<00:03:20.530> I

each species by that I mean I have a

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.149 
each species by that I mean I have a
smaller<00:05:58.990> managed<00:05:59.289> trip<00:05:59.469> in<00:05:59.589> a<00:05:59.650> smaller<00:05:59.919> home

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:00.159 
smaller managed trip in a smaller home

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:01.469 
smaller managed trip in a smaller home
and<00:06:00.339> a<00:06:00.370> bigger<00:06:00.580> mantis<00:06:00.879> shrimp<00:06:01.089> in<00:06:01.180> a<00:06:01.270> bigger

and a bigger mantis shrimp in a bigger

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:03.480 
and a bigger mantis shrimp in a bigger
home<00:06:01.750> and<00:06:01.990> that<00:06:02.620> seems<00:06:02.770> to<00:06:02.919> work<00:06:03.069> out<00:06:03.190> fine<00:06:03.460> for

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
home and that seems to work out fine for

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:04.769 
home and that seems to work out fine for
them<00:06:03.759> if<00:06:03.879> I<00:06:03.969> had<00:06:04.150> the<00:06:04.240> bigger<00:06:04.419> one<00:06:04.599> in<00:06:04.690> the

00:06:04.769 --> 00:06:04.779 
them if I had the bigger one in the

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:05.939 
them if I had the bigger one in the
smaller<00:06:05.050> home<00:06:05.319> where<00:06:05.500> they<00:06:05.589> are<00:06:05.680> both<00:06:05.800> the

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:05.949 
smaller home where they are both the

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:07.950 
smaller home where they are both the
same<00:06:05.979> size<00:06:06.190> and<00:06:06.849> they<00:06:07.509> both<00:06:07.659> have<00:06:07.870> the<00:06:07.930> same

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
same size and they both have the same

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.170 
same size and they both have the same
size<00:06:08.379> homes<00:06:08.650> then<00:06:09.339> maybe<00:06:09.520> one<00:06:09.729> of<00:06:09.759> them<00:06:09.940> would

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
size homes then maybe one of them would

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.519 
size homes then maybe one of them would
be<00:06:10.360> stronger<00:06:10.839> than<00:06:10.900> the<00:06:10.990> other<00:06:11.110> one<00:06:11.259> to<00:06:11.319> try<00:06:11.469> to

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:11.529 
be stronger than the other one to try to

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:12.959 
be stronger than the other one to try to
take<00:06:11.650> over<00:06:11.800> the<00:06:11.919> other<00:06:12.099> ones<00:06:12.250> home<00:06:12.460> might

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:12.969 
take over the other ones home might

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:14.700 
take over the other ones home might
happen<00:06:13.389> there's<00:06:13.629> a<00:06:13.690> 50-50<00:06:14.199> chance<00:06:14.229> you<00:06:14.650> know

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
happen there's a 50-50 chance you know

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.309 
happen there's a 50-50 chance you know
because<00:06:15.009> there's<00:06:15.159> two<00:06:15.339> of<00:06:15.370> them<00:06:15.460> in<00:06:15.639> there

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:16.319 
because there's two of them in there

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:18.689 
because there's two of them in there
there's<00:06:17.319> that<00:06:17.529> odds<00:06:17.770> that<00:06:18.069> that<00:06:18.339> might<00:06:18.490> happen

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:18.699 
there's that odds that that might happen

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:22.740 
there's that odds that that might happen
that<00:06:19.060> might<00:06:19.210> be<00:06:19.240> a<00:06:19.330> factor<00:06:19.569> so<00:06:21.210> I<00:06:22.210> just<00:06:22.509> want<00:06:22.719> to

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750 
that might be a factor so I just want to

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.119 
that might be a factor so I just want to
make<00:06:22.870> make<00:06:23.440> sure<00:06:23.589> that<00:06:23.770> you<00:06:23.830> guys<00:06:23.919> all<00:06:24.099> know

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:24.129 
make make sure that you guys all know

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:28.260 
make make sure that you guys all know
that<00:06:24.400> there<00:06:24.550> is<00:06:24.699> no<00:06:25.740> nothing<00:06:26.740> a<00:06:27.089> nothing<00:06:28.089> bad

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
that there is no nothing a nothing bad

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.510 
that there is no nothing a nothing bad
that's<00:06:28.449> going<00:06:28.509> to<00:06:28.659> transpire<00:06:28.990> here<00:06:29.469> we<00:06:30.099> have<00:06:30.310> I

species<00:06:51.690> like<00:06:51.990> I<00:06:52.110> said<00:06:52.260> the<00:06:52.350> peacock<00:06:52.620> has<00:06:52.740> a

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 
species like I said the peacock has a

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.670 
species like I said the peacock has a
larger<00:06:53.160> home<00:06:53.340> and<00:06:53.580> the<00:06:54.180> turnitin<00:06:54.870> sis<00:06:55.080> as<00:06:55.290> the

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 
larger home and the turnitin sis as the

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.580 
larger home and the turnitin sis as the
smaller<00:06:55.950> home<00:06:56.300> and<00:06:57.300> many<00:06:57.510> routes<00:06:57.780> were<00:06:58.200> where

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590 
smaller home and many routes were where

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:59.900 
smaller home and many routes were where
he<00:06:58.800> can<00:06:58.920> probably<00:06:59.070> escape<00:06:59.520> if<00:06:59.670> he<00:06:59.760> really

00:06:59.900 --> 00:06:59.910 
he can probably escape if he really

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.140 
he can probably escape if he really
needs<00:07:00.150> to<00:07:00.330> underneath<00:07:00.660> that<00:07:00.780> pink<00:07:01.050> Rock<00:07:01.320> thing

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:02.150 
needs to underneath that pink Rock thing

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.400 
needs to underneath that pink Rock thing
then<00:07:03.150> I<00:07:03.540> think<00:07:03.780> you'd<00:07:03.900> be<00:07:04.020> all<00:07:04.140> right<00:07:05.000> so

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:06.410 
then I think you'd be all right so

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.450 
then I think you'd be all right so
