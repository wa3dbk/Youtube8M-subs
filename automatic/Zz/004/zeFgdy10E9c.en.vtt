00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 hey line welcome to the new 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.500
 tutorial what is called example 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.480
 Optimization yes what you are under 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.849
 that's the way it is otherwise 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.410
 many already think that the problem is 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.000
 that you are low on her or hers 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.300
 Basics are hanging all the time 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.010
 on or four their fans louder such 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.330
 I had problems for a long time 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.779
 time and then I have a bit 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.949
 put it all in a bit 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.599
 reduce what you do not need 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.380
 and now it's all over 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.450
 fluid and I will do that today 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.399
 Show everything that I did 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.070
 In any case, running with me 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.750
 meanwhile really good player and 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.460
 You can follow me with a feedback 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.250
 whether it helped with you too 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.520
 did not help what is yours 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.980
 had problems and so on than first 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.399
 as always, they are three folders 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.859
 so document electronic arts the sims 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.510
 3 First of all, they know that 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.660
 at least that gives a folder 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.189
 because at last they keep fit here 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.860
 There are so many files in it and the ones 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.260
 you really do not need to be 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.939
 because these files should I say 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.070
 since a certain finish there 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.390
 in it 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.880
 all pictures of all store in 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.110
 Altenrhein saved and needs 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.220
 he is not in the game now so you can 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.490
 which practically delete 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.590
 but if you delete them, they will 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.100
 simply saved again he did so 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.000
 made 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.710
 they just come back again and again 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.060
 definitely 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.920
 I show you now can make such 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.420
 first each with a right click on the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.930
 folder feature rider and then up 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.360
 properties and then you go here 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:49.710
 security then you look up here 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:51.479
 are all the users and then looking for 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.040
 Just make the noise that makes you 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.380
 In other small shelf in any case 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.990
 you choose the user on the 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.740
 game 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:04.020
 then pressed here on edit and 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.390
 otherwise you 'll be happy down here 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.270
 then is to write here because it makes 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.709
 refuse a hook at and then refuse 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.640
 just take over and then traffic 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.799
 As I said we can do that everywhere 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.860
 make that decide for yourself 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.519
 I hope that now only where I always 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.349
 play 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:27.480
 We have done something like that now 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:29.310
 the set so that it is now again 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.410
 I can not say it in it 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.459
 get saved 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.560
 that means the pictures do not come 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.819
 more again and that means that again 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.980
 It's easy for everyone now 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.970
 you could let it out with you 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.769
 it's also pretty much that 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:49.440
 different from me are 127 and yes 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:52.560
 You always did what you did 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.959
 Of course you can always do that 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.450
 should be clear if you have the hitlists 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.709
 has a lot of course, always listen that 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.989
 you do not need what anymore 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:05.370
 does not work or what now 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.780
 Just do not know what you just 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.069
 you can do without that of course 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:14.209
 always out and that is essential for 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:17.730
 the downloads as well as even outfit 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.810
 and sixth she should always be beautiful 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.639
 from what he does not need 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.290
 Of course you can also recommend the 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.030
 getting screenshots always to learn then 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.260
 for example, on the desktop 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.730
 or should you file with the whole 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.410
 picture you can move one 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.180
 then you can see the ones from the sims 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.430
 delete folders because they burden that 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.959
 game actually even impossible so 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.650
 then there are also files that one 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.299
 can delete 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.040
 you can do that either before everyone 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.709
 make game start or topics such as 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:45.120
 what you do not do is replace it 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:49.139
 Then there's this fight 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:55.260
 How can you delete all of them then 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:57.530
 There are usually flowed folders 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.970
 Unfortunately I can not fix it 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.370
 the mist to either and before the 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.620
 but I believe now 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:12.629
 just then there are still the 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:15.480
 files you can do the same here 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:17.789
 leave because how should I say it 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.150
 generate themselves before every game takes place 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:22.680
 new and if you do not see it for too long 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.090
 erase better possible quite nicely and 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.830
 the the game burdened 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.400
 and therefore if you have the lights 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.750
 yes a little unloaded play and 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.970
 can also recommend this 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.449
 download here is always allowed 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.970
 not done if you something 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:41.560
 then you should have the 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.310
 you can change downloads afterwards you can 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:51.820
 just like myself, always 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:52.720
 no again i just like the pictures 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.910
 not exactly 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.320
 you can just save somewhere else 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.540
 then you can have from the after 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.550
 erase because that's just all 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.500
 shows what you need to play and 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.970
 What charged players and if you 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.610
 holds but think so I say 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:10.930
 now you can do something 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.810
 play carefree and then it will 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.550
 not really so much anymore 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.280
 There is not much more 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:21.490
 if you can still play in the game 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.139
 under the options the graphic something 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.810
 screw it down for the game 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:27.190
 not too much produce what 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.630
 I say now if I'm not like that 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.000
 it has to do a lot, of course 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:35.470
 also everything a little more liquid I have it 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.669
 everything about the middle except that shows what 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.610
 I do not need you at all 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:40.960
 no idea so they fell to me 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.849
 nothing but there are definitely 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.680
 does not show what you actually do not like that 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:46.750
 you just need low that 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.660
 others can be put on middle then 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:52.750
 sees the graphics actually still 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.690
 quite good but it runs just 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.889
 normal case a little faster 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.380
 that was actually in the big and 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:02.440
 already as I said you can me 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:05.380
 like to give a feedback if golf has 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.300
 you or still suggestions for improvement 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.550
 if you still know something you do 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.599
 so it can run a little faster 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.590
 you are welcome in the comments 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:14.710
 write 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.599
 or send a message to mine 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.389
 page in facebook the same the 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:20.710
 description as always and yes 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:23.130
 then I would say that to the next one 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.130
 times
