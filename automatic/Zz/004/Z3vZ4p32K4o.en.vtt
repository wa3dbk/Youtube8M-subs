and then if they might say the following
say<00:03:00.000> probably<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:01.390> know<00:03:01.480> play<00:03:01.750> around<00:03:01.900> for

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
say probably you know play around for

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.430 
say probably you know play around for
the<00:03:03.670> gear<00:03:03.970> in<00:03:04.120> on<00:03:04.270> it<00:03:04.390> different<00:03:05.260> sized

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
the gear in on it different sized

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.460 
the gear in on it different sized
sprockets<00:03:05.980> see<00:03:06.250> how<00:03:06.340> that<00:03:06.520> works<00:03:07.230> would<00:03:08.230> mind

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
sprockets see how that works would mind

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.460 
sprockets see how that works would mind
putting<00:03:08.770> a<00:03:08.830> few<00:03:09.010> nice<00:03:09.550> parts<00:03:10.000> on<00:03:10.180> there<00:03:10.360> a<00:03:10.989> new

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
putting a few nice parts on there a new

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.550 
putting a few nice parts on there a new
pipe<00:03:11.709> just<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.840> change<00:03:13.840> it<00:03:13.989> up<00:03:14.050> a<00:03:14.200> bit<00:03:14.230> and

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
pipe just to change it up a bit and

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.590 
pipe just to change it up a bit and
obviously<00:03:14.830> because<00:03:15.489> my<00:03:15.640> background<00:03:15.910> graphic

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
obviously because my background graphic

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.630 
obviously because my background graphic
so<00:03:16.750> I'm<00:03:16.810> going<00:03:16.959> to<00:03:17.070> make<00:03:18.070> the<00:03:18.160> thing<00:03:18.370> looking

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
so I'm going to make the thing looking

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.370
