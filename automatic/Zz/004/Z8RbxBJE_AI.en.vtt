decided to go looking for a Golden Apple

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.610 
decided to go looking for a Golden Apple
because<00:00:11.900> somebody<00:00:12.900> had<00:00:13.049> told<00:00:13.200> us<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.469> they

with<00:00:15.719> two<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:15.929> them<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.230> then<00:00:16.350> left<00:00:16.500> one<00:00:16.850> so<00:00:17.850> we

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
with two of them and then left one so we

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.160 
with two of them and then left one so we
went<00:00:18.359> looking<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:19.430> they're<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.490> bit<00:00:20.670> behind

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170

dungeon and i'm about to go look into it
and<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.160> thought<00:00:26.369> I'd<00:00:26.490> record<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:26.970> just<00:00:27.150> in<00:00:27.269> case

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
and I thought I'd record it just in case

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.769 
and I thought I'd record it just in case
I<00:00:27.570> did<00:00:27.869> find<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.789> golden<00:00:29.789> apple<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.269> happened

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
I did find a golden apple and I happened

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.000 
I did find a golden apple and I happened
to<00:00:30.810> one<00:00:31.109> up<00:00:31.260> Antvenom<00:00:32.630> so<00:00:33.630> let<00:00:34.079> us<00:00:34.260> take<00:00:34.770> that

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
to one up Antvenom so let us take that

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.350 
to one up Antvenom so let us take that
and<00:00:35.130> look<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.450> isn't<00:00:36.809> explored<00:00:38.360> done

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
and look and this isn't explored done

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.150 
and look and this isn't explored done
tonight<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.840> guess<00:00:40.350> that's<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.680> direction<00:00:40.950> of

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
tonight I guess that's the direction of

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.229 
tonight I guess that's the direction of
person<00:00:41.430> went<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:41.790> later<00:00:42.469> letters<00:00:43.469> grass<00:00:43.860> there

pressure<00:02:17.730> pad<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.150> was<00:02:18.329> nicely<00:02:19.019> hidden<00:02:19.290> I

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
pressure pad that was nicely hidden I

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.990 
pressure pad that was nicely hidden I
tried<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.709> keep<00:02:19.829> it<00:02:19.950> out<00:02:20.069> of<00:02:20.129> the<00:02:20.220> frame<00:02:20.549> I<00:02:20.819> like

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
tried to keep it out of the frame I like

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.009 
tried to keep it out of the frame I like
walking<00:02:21.269> like<00:02:21.540> this<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:22.349> yes<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.329> wrote<00:02:24.329> an<00:02:24.569> egg

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
walking like this and yes I wrote an egg

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.530 
walking like this and yes I wrote an egg
wall<00:02:25.319> right<00:02:25.680> here<00:02:25.879> and<00:02:26.879> you<00:02:26.909> fall<00:02:27.180> into<00:02:27.390> a

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
wall right here and you fall into a

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.190 
wall right here and you fall into a
death<00:02:28.349> pit<00:02:28.620> of<00:02:28.739> death<00:02:29.040> very<00:02:29.909> dangerous<00:02:30.420> ethos

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
death pit of death very dangerous ethos

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.770 
death pit of death very dangerous ethos
worst<00:02:31.739> kind<00:02:32.040> so<00:02:33.000> now<00:02:33.180> i'm<00:02:33.360> going<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.659> switch

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
worst kind so now i'm going to switch

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.330 
worst kind so now i'm going to switch
out<00:02:34.019> on<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.379> another<00:02:34.680> version<00:02:34.920> of<00:02:35.159> the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
out on to another version of the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.710 
out on to another version of the
shapefile<00:02:35.819> where<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.120> don't<00:02:36.390> have<00:02:36.569> these

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
shapefile where I don't have these

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.910 
shapefile where I don't have these
little<00:02:36.900> tools<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.349> everything's<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.650> bit<00:02:37.769> more

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
little tools and everything's a bit more

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.319 
little tools and everything's a bit more
structured<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.909> i'm<00:02:39.000> going<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.150> show<00:02:39.299> you

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
structured and i'm going to show you

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.000 
structured and i'm going to show you
exactly<00:02:39.540> what<00:02:39.959> I<00:02:40.019> did<00:02:40.200> because<00:02:40.349> I<00:02:40.500> didn't<00:02:40.859> fun

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
exactly what I did because I didn't fun

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.920 
exactly what I did because I didn't fun
building<00:02:41.280> with<00:02:41.400> redstone<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:42.060> do<00:02:42.569> still<00:02:42.870> think

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
building with redstone I do still think

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.410 
building with redstone I do still think
redstone<00:02:43.409> is<00:02:43.439> largely<00:02:43.829> useless<00:02:44.129> in<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:45.180> scope

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
redstone is largely useless in the scope

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.240 
redstone is largely useless in the scope
of<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.629> adventure<00:02:46.079> part<00:02:46.260> of<00:02:46.379> the<00:02:46.440> game<00:02:46.590> but

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
of the adventure part of the game but

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.440 
of the adventure part of the game but
this<00:02:47.370> wasn't<00:02:47.579> one<00:02:47.819> little<00:02:48.060> thing<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.269> build

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
this wasn't one little thing to build

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.789 
this wasn't one little thing to build
and<00:02:48.690> i'm<00:02:48.750> going<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:48.959> show<00:02:49.079> you<00:02:49.109> exactly<00:02:49.470> what<00:02:49.739> i

do alright folks welcome back this is
the<00:02:55.970> little<00:02:56.970> dungeon<00:02:57.299> that<00:02:57.480> I<00:02:57.629> built

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
the little dungeon that I built

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.410 
the little dungeon that I built
completely<00:02:58.739> self<00:02:59.519> filled<00:02:59.819> none<00:03:00.060> of<00:03:00.150> this<00:03:00.239> was

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
completely self filled none of this was

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.339 
completely self filled none of this was
here<00:03:00.480> before<00:03:00.780> obviously<00:03:01.139> and<00:03:02.959> here's<00:03:03.959> I'll

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
here before obviously and here's I'll

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.229 
here before obviously and here's I'll
take<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:04.709> through<00:03:04.950> what<00:03:05.220> happened<00:03:05.760> little

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
take you through what happened little

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.199 
take you through what happened little
bit<00:03:06.329> of<00:03:06.420> dirt<00:03:06.629> and<00:03:07.549> show<00:03:08.549> you<00:03:08.609> how<00:03:08.700> I<00:03:08.819> did<00:03:08.970> all

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
bit of dirt and show you how I did all

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.789 
bit of dirt and show you how I did all
this<00:03:09.420> I've<00:03:09.599> clearly<00:03:09.930> doubt<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.230> bit<00:03:10.470> I've<00:03:10.650> made

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
this I've clearly doubt a bit I've made

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.830 
this I've clearly doubt a bit I've made
it<00:03:10.920> easier<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.310> look<00:03:11.430> at<00:03:11.609> so<00:03:12.269> right<00:03:12.480> here<00:03:12.510> on

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
it easier to look at so right here on

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.410 
it easier to look at so right here on
the<00:03:12.959> sides<00:03:13.200> of<00:03:13.349> the<00:03:13.409> walls<00:03:13.560> I<00:03:13.879> would<00:03:14.879> keep<00:03:15.120> I

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
the sides of the walls I would keep I

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.059 
the sides of the walls I would keep I
put<00:03:16.049> all<00:03:16.079> the<00:03:16.260> lava<00:03:16.440> right<00:03:16.680> there<00:03:16.829> that<00:03:16.980> would

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
put all the lava right there that would

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.640 
put all the lava right there that would
spill<00:03:17.340> out<00:03:17.370> at<00:03:17.609> me<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:18.169> this<00:03:19.169> dirt<00:03:19.410> block<00:03:19.620> i

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
spill out at me and this dirt block i

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.990 
spill out at me and this dirt block i
replaced<00:03:20.099> all<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.280> blocks<00:03:20.549> that<00:03:20.699> were<00:03:20.819> once

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
replaced all the blocks that were once

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.520 
replaced all the blocks that were once
cobble<00:03:21.419> with<00:03:21.510> dirt<00:03:21.780> so<00:03:21.959> it<00:03:22.019> would<00:03:22.109> be<00:03:22.199> easier

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
cobble with dirt so it would be easier

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.580 
cobble with dirt so it would be easier
to<00:03:22.590> see<00:03:22.919> um<00:03:23.549> and<00:03:24.239> they<00:03:24.959> would<00:03:25.079> be<00:03:25.169> lava<00:03:25.349> here

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
to see um and they would be lava here

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.659 
to see um and they would be lava here
and<00:03:25.680> it<00:03:25.739> would<00:03:25.829> spill<00:03:26.040> out<00:03:26.069> as<00:03:26.280> soon<00:03:26.430> as<00:03:26.579> the

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
and it would spill out as soon as the

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.819 
and it would spill out as soon as the
pistons<00:03:27.000> were<00:03:27.150> activated<00:03:27.690> now<00:03:28.290> let's<00:03:28.590> go<00:03:28.680> take

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
pistons were activated now let's go take

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.759 
pistons were activated now let's go take
a<00:03:28.919> look<00:03:28.949> at<00:03:29.129> that<00:03:29.220> from<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.489> inside<00:03:30.500> now<00:03:31.500> what

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
a look at that from the inside now what

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:32.990 
a look at that from the inside now what
I<00:03:31.799> did<00:03:32.040> under<00:03:32.459> there<00:03:32.639> is<00:03:32.790> much<00:03:32.970> more

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
I did under there is much more

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.520 
I did under there is much more
impressive<00:03:33.449> but<00:03:33.870> I'm<00:03:34.049> gonna<00:03:34.139> take<00:03:34.230> a<00:03:34.319> look<00:03:34.440> at

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
impressive but I'm gonna take a look at

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.020 
impressive but I'm gonna take a look at
that<00:03:34.620> in<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.799> second<00:03:35.069> and<00:03:35.250> there<00:03:35.430> is<00:03:35.549> that<00:03:35.699> exact

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
that in a second and there is that exact

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.270 
that in a second and there is that exact
dirt<00:03:36.299> and<00:03:36.480> right<00:03:37.440> now<00:03:37.620> i'm<00:03:37.769> actually<00:03:37.949> i'm

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
dirt and right now i'm actually i'm

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.129 
dirt and right now i'm actually i'm
using<00:03:38.609> a<00:03:38.760> wooden<00:03:39.180> pressure<00:03:39.510> pad<00:03:39.750> so<00:03:39.930> i<00:03:39.989> can

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
using a wooden pressure pad so i can

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.259 
using a wooden pressure pad so i can
keep<00:03:40.290> it<00:03:40.440> activated<00:03:41.099> because<00:03:41.879> once<00:03:42.180> you

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
keep it activated because once you

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.849 
keep it activated because once you
activate<00:03:42.449> it<00:03:42.690> it<00:03:42.870> sort<00:03:43.049> of<00:03:43.139> like<00:03:43.349> locks<00:03:43.650> in

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
activate it it sort of like locks in

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:45.890 
activate it it sort of like locks in
place<00:03:43.889> so<00:03:44.819> I'm<00:03:44.879> keeping<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.269> activated<00:03:45.750> like

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
place so I'm keeping it activated like

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.960 
place so I'm keeping it activated like
this<00:03:46.139> using<00:03:46.379> these<00:03:46.699> oops<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:50.400> I'll<00:03:50.790> show<00:03:50.940> you

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
this using these oops and I'll show you

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:57.699 
this using these oops and I'll show you
exactly<00:03:51.269> how<00:03:51.449> it<00:03:51.629> all<00:03:51.720> works<00:03:51.959> in<00:03:52.169> a<00:03:52.319> second<00:03:54.919> or

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
exactly how it all works in a second or

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.140 
exactly how it all works in a second or
don't<00:03:58.709> know<00:03:58.949> I<00:03:58.980> actually<00:03:59.489> have<00:03:59.730> no<00:03:59.790> idea<00:03:59.879> how<00:04:00.120> I

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
don't know I actually have no idea how I

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.930 
don't know I actually have no idea how I
got<00:04:00.239> all<00:04:00.449> these<00:04:00.569> lovers<00:04:00.840> I<00:04:01.079> never<00:04:01.639> never<00:04:02.639> too

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
got all these lovers I never never too

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.110 
got all these lovers I never never too
many<00:04:03.090> items<00:04:03.239> different<00:04:03.840> them<00:04:04.049> so<00:04:05.000> here<00:04:06.000> we

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
many items different them so here we

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.289 
many items different them so here we
have<00:04:07.129> these<00:04:08.129> little<00:04:08.340> blocks<00:04:08.609> that<00:04:08.879> would<00:04:09.030> fall

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
have these little blocks that would fall

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:10.670 
have these little blocks that would fall
down<00:04:09.329> into<00:04:09.629> lava<00:04:09.930> right<00:04:10.169> now<00:04:10.290> and<00:04:10.409> replace

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
down into lava right now and replace

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.180 
down into lava right now and replace
that<00:04:10.709> with<00:04:10.949> water<00:04:11.190> for<00:04:11.459> convenience<00:04:12.030> and<00:04:13.190> so

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
that with water for convenience and so

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.689 
that with water for convenience and so
you<00:04:14.400> step<00:04:14.609> on<00:04:14.729> this<00:04:14.849> pressure<00:04:15.060> pad<00:04:15.419> a<00:04:16.699> lava

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
you step on this pressure pad a lava

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.000 
you step on this pressure pad a lava
spills<00:04:18.060> out<00:04:18.239> from<00:04:18.389> there<00:04:18.599> you<00:04:19.139> fall<00:04:19.409> down<00:04:19.590> here

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
spills out from there you fall down here

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.260 
spills out from there you fall down here
and<00:04:20.510> I<00:04:21.740> really<00:04:22.740> I<00:04:22.889> am<00:04:23.340> impressed<00:04:23.880> with<00:04:24.120> myself

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
and I really I am impressed with myself

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.890 
and I really I am impressed with myself
and<00:04:24.599> how<00:04:24.960> I<00:04:24.990> built<00:04:25.260> this

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
and how I built this

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.040 
and how I built this
so<00:04:26.229> the<00:04:26.320> pressure<00:04:26.530> pad<00:04:26.800> is<00:04:27.639> wired<00:04:28.050> through

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
so the pressure pad is wired through

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.939 
so the pressure pad is wired through
your<00:04:29.740> ipod<00:04:30.100> and<00:04:30.750> immediately<00:04:31.750> it<00:04:32.410> picks<00:04:32.770> up

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949 
your ipod and immediately it picks up

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.340 
your ipod and immediately it picks up
this<00:04:33.130> piston<00:04:33.610> and<00:04:33.850> it<00:04:34.000> pulls<00:04:34.240> that<00:04:34.389> back<00:04:34.660> which

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
this piston and it pulls that back which

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.379 
this piston and it pulls that back which
releases<00:04:35.949> one<00:04:36.250> of<00:04:36.340> the<00:04:36.430> little<00:04:36.639> doors<00:04:36.880> or<00:04:37.330> a

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
releases one of the little doors or a

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.820 
releases one of the little doors or a
little<00:04:37.960> like<00:04:38.080> holding<00:04:38.530> box<00:04:39.810> then<00:04:40.810> this<00:04:41.380> goes

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
little like holding box then this goes

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.290 
little like holding box then this goes
in<00:04:42.039> two<00:04:42.160> different<00:04:42.340> directions<00:04:42.460> it<00:04:42.940> goes<00:04:43.090> this

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
in two different directions it goes this

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.400 
in two different directions it goes this
way<00:04:44.550> now<00:04:45.550> where<00:04:45.880> it<00:04:46.030> takes<00:04:46.300> it<00:04:46.750> into<00:04:47.080> three

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
way now where it takes it into three

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:48.930 
way now where it takes it into three
different<00:04:47.560> directions<00:04:47.770> and<00:04:48.190> I'll<00:04:48.310> go<00:04:48.610> but<00:04:48.729> the

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
different directions and I'll go but the

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.469 
different directions and I'll go but the
easier<00:04:49.270> way<00:04:49.419> first<00:04:50.370> here<00:04:51.370> Oh<00:04:52.050> two<00:04:53.050> of<00:04:53.169> these

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
easier way first here Oh two of these

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:57.689 
easier way first here Oh two of these
are<00:04:55.479> actually<00:04:55.930> the<00:04:55.960> ones<00:04:56.220> little<00:04:57.220> blocks<00:04:57.370> here

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
are actually the ones little blocks here

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.420 
are actually the ones little blocks here
that<00:04:57.880> release<00:04:58.180> the<00:04:58.330> lava<00:04:58.570> so<00:04:59.560> this<00:04:59.800> and<00:05:00.039> this

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
that release the lava so this and this

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.420 
that release the lava so this and this
release<00:05:01.180> the<00:05:01.360> lava<00:05:01.570> from<00:05:01.870> the<00:05:02.110> cell<00:05:02.680> walls<00:05:03.070> and

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
release the lava from the cell walls and

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.210 
release the lava from the cell walls and
this<00:05:04.150> is<00:05:04.449> a<00:05:04.510> piston<00:05:05.050> that<00:05:05.169> pulls<00:05:05.410> away<00:05:05.560> part<00:05:05.949> of

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
this is a piston that pulls away part of

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.689 
this is a piston that pulls away part of
this<00:05:07.180> trifecta<00:05:07.840> right<00:05:08.139> here<00:05:08.350> now<00:05:09.220> the<00:05:09.669> other

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
this trifecta right here now the other

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:12.960 
this trifecta right here now the other
thing<00:05:09.940> that<00:05:10.150> i<00:05:10.300> really<00:05:10.680> had<00:05:11.680> trouble<00:05:12.520> with<00:05:12.639> but

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
thing that i really had trouble with but

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.629 
thing that i really had trouble with but
eventually<00:05:13.389> got<00:05:13.780> through<00:05:14.410> was<00:05:15.160> getting<00:05:15.490> this

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
eventually got through was getting this

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:17.279 
eventually got through was getting this
little<00:05:16.000> block<00:05:16.210> here<00:05:16.690> in<00:05:16.870> the<00:05:17.050> middle<00:05:17.260> to

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
little block here in the middle to

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:19.500 
little block here in the middle to
release<00:05:17.830> and<00:05:18.160> i<00:05:18.220> did<00:05:18.430> this<00:05:18.610> in<00:05:18.910> such<00:05:19.240> a<00:05:19.270> manner

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
release and i did this in such a manner

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.790 
release and i did this in such a manner
where<00:05:20.199> I<00:05:22.050> and<00:05:23.050> I'll<00:05:23.169> actually<00:05:23.320> show<00:05:23.500> you<00:05:23.620> guys

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
where I and I'll actually show you guys

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.129 
where I and I'll actually show you guys
right<00:05:24.039> now<00:05:24.099> this<00:05:24.599> makes<00:05:25.599> more<00:05:25.780> sense<00:05:25.990> if<00:05:26.080> I

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
right now this makes more sense if I

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:27.510 
right now this makes more sense if I
show<00:05:26.289> you<00:05:26.349> and<00:05:26.530> receive<00:05:26.770> exactly<00:05:26.860> don't<00:05:27.310> talk

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
show you and receive exactly don't talk

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:36.900 
show you and receive exactly don't talk
about<00:05:34.349> right<00:05:35.349> so<00:05:35.830> we<00:05:36.099> have<00:05:36.280> this<00:05:36.400> third<00:05:36.639> block

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
about right so we have this third block

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.939 
about right so we have this third block
here<00:05:37.300> and<00:05:37.479> it's<00:05:37.900> touch<00:05:38.199> to<00:05:38.380> a<00:05:38.410> piston<00:05:38.800> right

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
here and it's touch to a piston right

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.330 
here and it's touch to a piston right
there<00:05:39.160> and<00:05:40.150> two<00:05:40.810> other<00:05:40.960> Pistons<00:05:41.409> are<00:05:41.650> doing

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
there and two other Pistons are doing

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.529 
there and two other Pistons are doing
some<00:05:42.550> in<00:05:42.669> there<00:05:42.789> now<00:05:42.940> you're<00:05:43.060> not<00:05:43.180> sure<00:05:43.389> what

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 
some in there now you're not sure what

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:45.810 
some in there now you're not sure what
right<00:05:43.750> now<00:05:43.900> but<00:05:44.169> to<00:05:45.039> get<00:05:45.159> rid<00:05:45.370> of<00:05:45.400> this<00:05:45.580> block

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
right now but to get rid of this block

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.879 
right now but to get rid of this block
and<00:05:46.030> have<00:05:46.150> someone<00:05:46.330> to<00:05:46.449> fall<00:05:46.599> in<00:05:46.840> well<00:05:47.560> I<00:05:47.680> had

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:47.889 
and have someone to fall in well I had

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.070 
and have someone to fall in well I had
to<00:05:48.039> get<00:05:48.310> rid<00:05:48.460> of<00:05:48.520> both<00:05:48.669> the<00:05:48.849> piston<00:05:49.240> and<00:05:49.419> B

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
to get rid of both the piston and B

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.159 
to get rid of both the piston and B
Block<00:05:50.349> there<00:05:50.680> so<00:05:51.610> as<00:05:52.270> soon<00:05:52.510> as<00:05:52.690> the<00:05:52.810> piston

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
Block there so as soon as the piston

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:55.110 
Block there so as soon as the piston
pulled<00:05:53.710> the<00:05:53.830> block<00:05:54.039> down<00:05:54.280> I<00:05:54.580> had<00:05:54.970> at<00:05:55.090> one

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
pulled the block down I had at one

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.589 
pulled the block down I had at one
piston<00:05:56.070> tied<00:05:57.070> or<00:05:57.250> Peter<00:05:57.550> pull<00:05:58.150> away<00:05:58.270> the<00:05:58.449> dirt

00:05:58.589 --> 00:05:58.599 
piston tied or Peter pull away the dirt

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:00.870 
piston tied or Peter pull away the dirt
block<00:05:58.840> and<00:05:59.139> another<00:05:59.380> piston<00:06:00.340> pull<00:06:00.580> away<00:06:00.669> the

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
block and another piston pull away the

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.730 
block and another piston pull away the
actual<00:06:01.060> piston<00:06:01.690> so<00:06:02.440> here's<00:06:02.650> how<00:06:02.770> that<00:06:02.860> looks

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
actual piston so here's how that looks

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:10.170 
actual piston so here's how that looks
see<00:06:05.940> so<00:06:06.940> one<00:06:07.510> custom<00:06:08.099> 23<00:06:09.099> and<00:06:09.370> actually<00:06:10.060> got

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
see so one custom 23 and actually got

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.490 
see so one custom 23 and actually got
repeaters<00:06:10.570> to<00:06:10.690> work<00:06:10.840> which<00:06:11.050> makes<00:06:11.260> me<00:06:11.380> very

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
repeaters to work which makes me very

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.660 
repeaters to work which makes me very
happy<00:06:11.710> and<00:06:12.490> here's<00:06:12.699> the<00:06:12.909> little<00:06:13.090> law<00:06:13.360> of<00:06:13.599> eggs

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:17.670 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.870 

and<00:06:18.500> that<00:06:19.500> is<00:06:19.650> how<00:06:19.770> I<00:06:19.800> wired<00:06:20.100> it<00:06:20.280> i<00:06:20.370> use<00:06:20.550> several

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
and that is how I wired it i use several

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.580 
and that is how I wired it i use several
different<00:06:21.030> ears<00:06:21.600> and<00:06:21.870> actually<00:06:22.200> i<00:06:22.230> couldn't

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
different ears and actually i couldn't

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.410 
different ears and actually i couldn't
get<00:06:22.710> this<00:06:22.980> piston<00:06:23.370> to<00:06:23.460> work<00:06:23.640> at<00:06:23.820> first<00:06:24.000> to<00:06:24.300> this

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:24.420 
get this piston to work at first to this

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.780 
get this piston to work at first to this
one<00:06:24.600> that<00:06:24.780> gets<00:06:24.960> pulled<00:06:25.170> back<00:06:25.640> but<00:06:26.640> then<00:06:26.730> i

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:26.790 
one that gets pulled back but then i

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:27.800 
one that gets pulled back but then i
realized<00:06:26.970> i<00:06:27.180> had<00:06:27.270> to<00:06:27.360> dig<00:06:27.480> a<00:06:27.510> little<00:06:27.660> trench

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
realized i had to dig a little trench

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.480 
realized i had to dig a little trench
right<00:06:28.200> here<00:06:28.440> under<00:06:28.680> this<00:06:28.830> one<00:06:29.010> so<00:06:29.160> it<00:06:29.220> wouldn't

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.490 
right here under this one so it wouldn't

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.580 
right here under this one so it wouldn't
affect<00:06:29.550> it<00:06:29.910> and<00:06:30.660> eventually<00:06:30.870> I<00:06:31.050> got<00:06:31.140> it<00:06:31.380> all<00:06:31.470> to

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590 
affect it and eventually I got it all to

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.260 
affect it and eventually I got it all to
work<00:06:31.770> in<00:06:32.010> the<00:06:32.100> beginning<00:06:32.250> I<00:06:32.490> would<00:06:32.610> have<00:06:32.760> one

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
work in the beginning I would have one

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.030 
work in the beginning I would have one
or<00:06:33.300> two<00:06:33.540> of<00:06:33.630> them<00:06:33.750> not<00:06:33.960> working<00:06:34.170> but<00:06:34.740> in<00:06:34.920> the

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:35.040 
or two of them not working but in the

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.190 
or two of them not working but in the
end<00:06:35.070> as<00:06:35.280> you<00:06:35.400> saw<00:06:35.610> I<00:06:35.880> got<00:06:36.780> it<00:06:36.900> all<00:06:36.990> to<00:06:37.110> work

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.200 
end as you saw I got it all to work

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.020 
end as you saw I got it all to work
quite<00:06:37.470> nicely<00:06:37.530> and<00:06:38.130> I'm<00:06:38.460> quite<00:06:38.760> happy<00:06:38.880> with

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030 
quite nicely and I'm quite happy with

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.310 
quite nicely and I'm quite happy with
how<00:06:39.300> it<00:06:39.360> all<00:06:39.450> works<00:06:39.660> out<00:06:41.870> so<00:06:42.870> let's<00:06:42.990> see<00:06:43.140> that

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:43.320 
how it all works out so let's see that

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:48.100 
how it all works out so let's see that
next<00:06:43.590> one<00:06:43.770> more<00:06:43.950> time<00:06:46.160> there<00:06:47.160> you<00:06:47.250> go<00:06:47.430> and

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.110 
next one more time there you go and

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.490 
next one more time there you go and
usually<00:06:49.110> i'm<00:06:49.620> actually<00:06:50.520> not<00:06:50.850> usually<00:06:51.420> but

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:51.500 
usually i'm actually not usually but

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.500 
usually i'm actually not usually but
yeah<00:06:52.500> so<00:06:52.710> you<00:06:52.800> couldn't<00:06:52.920> jump<00:06:53.220> out<00:06:53.400> there<00:06:53.910> I

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:54.510 
yeah so you couldn't jump out there I

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.000 
yeah so you couldn't jump out there I
couldn't<00:06:55.080> put<00:06:55.140> lava<00:06:55.320> there<00:06:55.590> because<00:06:55.830> it<00:06:55.920> would

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.010 
couldn't put lava there because it would

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.800 
couldn't put lava there because it would
get<00:06:56.190> rid<00:06:56.340> of<00:06:56.370> that<00:06:56.580> little<00:06:56.820> trench<00:06:57.090> that<00:06:57.330> was

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:57.810 
get rid of that little trench that was

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.430 
get rid of that little trench that was
sort<00:06:58.740> of<00:06:58.800> necessary<00:06:59.040> to<00:06:59.460> keep<00:06:59.610> it<00:06:59.760> all<00:06:59.880> working

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:00.440 
sort of necessary to keep it all working

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.740 
sort of necessary to keep it all working
but<00:07:01.460> one<00:07:02.460> way<00:07:02.610> or<00:07:02.730> another<00:07:02.760> you<00:07:03.360> probably<00:07:03.630> be

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:03.750 
but one way or another you probably be

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.840 
but one way or another you probably be
going<00:07:03.990> in<00:07:04.140> from<00:07:05.010> over<00:07:05.250> here<00:07:05.280> from<00:07:05.610> this

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:05.850 
going in from over here from this

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:09.460 
going in from over here from this
pressure<00:07:06.120> pad<00:07:06.450> to<00:07:07.020> trolling<00:07:07.380> and<00:07:07.950> different

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:09.470 
pressure pad to trolling and different

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.260 
pressure pad to trolling and different
