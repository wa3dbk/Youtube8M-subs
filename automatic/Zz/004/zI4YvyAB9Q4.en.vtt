you choose there are two versions for

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.010 
you choose there are two versions for
the<00:00:58.949> circular<00:00:59.309> helicopter<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.510> glass<00:01:00.750> fiber

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
the circular helicopter the glass fiber

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.770 
the circular helicopter the glass fiber
one<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.530> also<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.489> carbon<00:01:03.030> fiber<00:01:03.239> one<00:01:03.510> and

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
one and also the carbon fiber one and

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.080 
one and also the carbon fiber one and
this<00:01:04.439> one<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.799> circle<00:01:05.100> as<00:01:05.189> fiber<00:01:05.400> version<00:01:05.700> and

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
this one is circle as fiber version and

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.359 
this one is circle as fiber version and
then<00:01:06.600> at<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.930> first<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.380> truly<00:01:07.890> thought<00:01:08.040> about

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
then at the first I truly thought about

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.640 
then at the first I truly thought about
the<00:01:08.580> glass<00:01:08.790> fiber<00:01:09.000> strings<00:01:09.479> but<00:01:09.720> after<00:01:10.110> twilit

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
the glass fiber strings but after twilit

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.830 
the glass fiber strings but after twilit
I<00:01:10.770> was<00:01:11.100> convinced<00:01:11.700> because<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.570> flying

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
I was convinced because the flying

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.080 
I was convinced because the flying
performance<00:01:13.350> was<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:13.950> nice<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:14.850> feel

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
performance was is so nice I can feel

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.030 
performance was is so nice I can feel
any<00:01:15.299> difference<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.930> course<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.710> carbon

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
any difference of course the carbon

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.740 
any difference of course the carbon
fiber<00:01:17.220> one<00:01:17.490> can<00:01:17.820> give<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.150> more<00:01:18.360> strings

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
fiber one can give you more strings

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.289 
fiber one can give you more strings
stiff<00:01:19.439> needs<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.070> also<00:01:20.310> efficiency<00:01:21.030> guilt

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
stiff needs and also efficiency guilt

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.210 
stiff needs and also efficiency guilt
it's<00:01:21.450> lighter<00:01:21.720> weight<00:01:21.869> but<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.680> glass<00:01:22.950> fiber

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
it's lighter weight but the glass fiber

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.030 
it's lighter weight but the glass fiber
one<00:01:23.490> didn't<00:01:23.970> fail<00:01:24.150> me<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.570> let's<00:01:25.350> see<00:01:25.500> why

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
one didn't fail me and let's see why

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.700 
one didn't fail me and let's see why
okay<00:01:26.310> what<00:01:26.610> impressed<00:01:27.060> me<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.420> lot<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.200> arms

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
okay what impressed me a lot is the arms

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.039 
okay what impressed me a lot is the arms
okay<00:01:29.460> from<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.880> side<00:01:30.090> view<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.600> can<00:01:30.780> see<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
okay from the side view you can see the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.440 
okay from the side view you can see the
arms<00:01:31.530> are<00:01:31.740> requested<00:01:32.400> right<00:01:32.820> it's<00:01:33.240> about

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
arms are requested right it's about

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.569 
arms are requested right it's about
maybe<00:01:34.200> six<00:01:35.450> millimeter<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:37.140> if<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.740> put<00:01:38.490> it

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
maybe six millimeter but if you put it

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.120 
maybe six millimeter but if you put it
upside<00:01:38.909> down<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.299> can<00:01:39.479> discover<00:01:40.140> it's<00:01:40.799> all

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
upside down you can discover it's all

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.399 
upside down you can discover it's all
