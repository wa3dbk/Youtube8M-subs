00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
bit of a habit and you would notice that

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.030 
bit of a habit and you would notice that
I<00:02:18.540> pretty<00:02:18.870> much<00:02:19.019> have<00:02:19.349> no<00:02:19.530> idea<00:02:19.799> what<00:02:19.920> I'm

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
I pretty much have no idea what I'm

I pretty much have no idea what I'm
doing<00:02:20.069> I've<00:02:20.640> only<00:02:20.969> actually<00:02:21.510> played<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:22.140> couple

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
doing I've only actually played a couple

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.339 
doing I've only actually played a couple
of<00:02:23.040> turns<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.519> this<00:02:23.790> mode<00:02:24.030> like<00:02:24.689> I<00:02:24.840> said<00:02:24.900> my<00:02:25.170> I'm

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
of turns of this mode like I said my I'm

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.589 
of turns of this mode like I said my I'm
actually<00:02:25.590> got<00:02:25.950> worse<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.760> longer<00:02:27.060> I<00:02:27.239> played

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
actually got worse the longer I played

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.899 
actually got worse the longer I played
but<00:02:28.230> my<00:02:28.349> actual<00:02:28.680> understanding<00:02:29.519> of<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.730> mood

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
but my actual understanding of the mood

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.839 
but my actual understanding of the mood
for<00:02:30.180> better<00:02:30.510> hence<00:02:31.290> why<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:32.040> thought<00:02:32.549> that<00:02:32.730> I'd

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
for better hence why I thought that I'd

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.059 
for better hence why I thought that I'd
actually<00:02:33.030> post<00:02:33.540> this<00:02:33.900> gameplay<00:02:34.260> as<00:02:34.709> opposed

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
actually post this gameplay as opposed

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.309 
actually post this gameplay as opposed
to<00:02:35.459> I<00:02:35.670> know<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.090> think<00:02:36.209> there<00:02:36.480> was<00:02:36.510> four<00:02:36.930> others

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
to I know I think there was four others

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.220 
to I know I think there was four others
maybe<00:02:38.250> five<00:02:38.700> others<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.750> were<00:02:39.870> recorded

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
maybe five others that were recorded

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.860

although<00:02:41.129> I<00:02:41.159> was<00:02:41.430> mainly<00:02:41.700> then<00:02:42.090> just<00:02:42.750> to

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
although I was mainly then just to

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.720 
although I was mainly then just to
record<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.319> few<00:02:43.530> things<00:02:43.680> from<00:02:43.920> my<00:02:44.099> mate<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.609> to

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
record a few things from my mate and to

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
give it a bit of a test because I don't

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:48.979 
give it a bit of a test because I don't
know<00:02:46.920> nice<00:02:47.489> shiny<00:02:47.939> things<00:02:48.299> with<00:02:48.540> us<00:02:48.569> gamers
