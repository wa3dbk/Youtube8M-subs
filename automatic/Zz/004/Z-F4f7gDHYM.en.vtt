00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
and you're starting to break into maybe

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.289 
and you're starting to break into maybe
their<00:01:37.439> rest<00:01:37.680> time<00:01:37.950> or<00:01:38.250> or<00:01:38.460> training<00:01:38.909> time<00:01:39.150> or

session and then we want to look at

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.100 
session and then we want to look at
taking<00:01:47.430> advantage<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.880> space<00:01:48.270> between<00:01:48.570> racks

as far as rafter rack allowed us to do

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.149 
as far as rafter rack allowed us to do
pull-ups<00:01:54.750> allowed<00:01:55.320> us<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.530> put<00:01:55.829> our<00:01:55.920> pulley

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
pull-ups allowed us to put our pulley

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.639 
pull-ups allowed us to put our pulley
systems<00:01:56.610> in<00:01:56.759> between<00:01:57.000> every<00:01:57.240> rack<00:01:57.649> it

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
systems in between every rack it

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.639 
systems in between every rack it
actually<00:01:59.100> gave<00:01:59.310> us<00:01:59.430> more<00:01:59.579> pulley<00:01:59.880> systems

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
actually gave us more pulley systems

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.980 
actually gave us more pulley systems
which<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:01.979> turn<00:02:02.880> allows<00:02:03.630> us<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.869> do<00:02:03.930> more

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
which in turn allows us to do more

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.920 
which in turn allows us to do more
movements<00:02:04.939> different<00:02:05.939> movements<00:02:06.390> specialty

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
movements different movements specialty

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.930 
movements different movements specialty
movements<00:02:07.409> within<00:02:07.890> every<00:02:08.369> single<00:02:08.700> station

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
movements within every single station

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.600 
movements within every single station
with<00:02:09.300> our<00:02:09.450> players<00:02:09.979> and<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.129> we<00:02:11.250> don't<00:02:11.400> have<00:02:11.459> to

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
with our players and so we don't have to

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.280 
with our players and so we don't have to
cycle<00:02:12.000> off<00:02:12.120> different<00:02:12.450> move

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290

cycle off different move
with<00:02:13.590> guys<00:02:13.890> just<00:02:14.400> because<00:02:14.579> we<00:02:14.640> don't<00:02:14.700> have

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.569 
with guys just because we don't have
enough<00:02:15.000> equipment<00:02:15.860> but<00:02:16.860> but<00:02:17.189> the<00:02:17.310> racks

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
non-slip oak platform that we actually

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.660 
non-slip oak platform that we actually
put<00:04:53.760> a<00:04:53.820> had<00:04:54.660> a<00:04:54.690> transparent<00:04:55.380> silica<00:04:55.860> put<00:04:56.550> on

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
put a had a transparent silica put on

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.480 
put a had a transparent silica put on
the<00:04:56.820> platform<00:04:57.380> and<00:04:58.380> then<00:04:58.590> lacquered<00:04:59.100> over<00:04:59.340> and

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
the platform and then lacquered over and

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.160 
the platform and then lacquered over and
finished<00:04:59.820> over<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:00.120> top<00:05:00.330> of<00:05:00.540> it<00:05:00.660> so<00:05:00.810> it<00:05:01.020> was<00:05:01.140> a

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
finished over the top of it so it was a

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.770 
finished over the top of it so it was a
non-slip<00:05:01.710> platform<00:05:02.430> but<00:05:02.940> still<00:05:03.330> an<00:05:03.570> oak

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
non-slip platform but still an oak

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.990 
non-slip platform but still an oak
platform<00:05:04.440> so<00:05:05.010> it<00:05:05.070> still<00:05:05.280> had<00:05:05.430> that<00:05:05.550> good<00:05:05.730> feel

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
platform so it still had that good feel

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.300 
platform so it still had that good feel
when<00:05:06.210> they<00:05:06.300> power<00:05:06.570> cleaned<00:05:06.900> and<00:05:07.890> then<00:05:08.070> it<00:05:08.190> was

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
when they power cleaned and then it was

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.070 
when they power cleaned and then it was
a<00:05:08.840> flush<00:05:09.840> platform<00:05:10.530> to<00:05:10.740> the<00:05:10.860> to<00:05:11.190> the<00:05:11.310> ground<00:05:11.550> so

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
a flush platform to the to the ground so

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.110 
a flush platform to the to the ground so
inlaid<00:05:13.080> and<00:05:13.350> in<00:05:13.500> the<00:05:13.590> floor<00:05:13.830> so<00:05:14.790> our<00:05:14.940> guys

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
inlaid and in the floor so our guys

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.880 
inlaid and in the floor so our guys
don't<00:05:15.300> have<00:05:15.390> to<00:05:15.450> worry<00:05:15.660> about<00:05:15.810> platforms<00:05:16.260> and

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
don't have to worry about platforms and

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.440 
don't have to worry about platforms and
then<00:05:17.040> you<00:05:17.160> taking<00:05:17.490> up<00:05:17.610> space<00:05:17.760> and<00:05:18.150> you<00:05:18.210> can<00:05:18.330> do

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
then you taking up space and you can do

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.780 
then you taking up space and you can do
more<00:05:18.630> movement<00:05:19.290> at<00:05:19.710> your<00:05:20.070> station<00:05:20.610> and<00:05:20.730> not

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
more movement at your station and not

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.190 
more movement at your station and not
have<00:05:21.000> to<00:05:21.090> worry<00:05:21.300> about<00:05:21.390> a<00:05:21.510> four<00:05:21.780> inch<00:05:21.810> raised

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200
