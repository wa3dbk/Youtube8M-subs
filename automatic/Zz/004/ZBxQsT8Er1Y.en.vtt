ruler know if you can see that on each
side<00:03:01.200> there's<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.620> ruler<00:03:02.450> so<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.900> case

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
side there's a ruler so that the case

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.620 
side there's a ruler so that the case
you're<00:03:04.319> asked<00:03:04.739> to<00:03:04.769> pick<00:03:05.639> up<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.880> boat<00:03:06.060> extreme

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
you're asked to pick up a boat extreme

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.870 
you're asked to pick up a boat extreme
millimeters<00:03:07.260> you<00:03:07.470> don't<00:03:07.650> have<00:03:07.829> to<00:03:08.069> search<00:03:08.609> and

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
millimeters you don't have to search and

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.550 
millimeters you don't have to search and
hope<00:03:09.030> that<00:03:09.180> they<00:03:09.329> wrote<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:09.630> on<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.840> head<00:03:10.019> in

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
hope that they wrote it on the head in

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.750 
hope that they wrote it on the head in
tiny<00:03:11.370> writing<00:03:11.819> taxi<00:03:12.540> on<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.870> side<00:03:13.730> so<00:03:14.730> you

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
instructions on how to put it together

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.309 
instructions on how to put it together
and<00:03:19.760> this<00:03:20.760> stuff<00:03:21.060> out<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.389> way

you have to actually stand the phils

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.390 
you have to actually stand the phils
springle<00:03:26.540> sturdy<00:03:26.900> yeah<00:03:27.739> I<00:03:27.769> don't<00:03:28.010> think<00:03:28.250> it's

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
springle sturdy yeah I don't think it's

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.490 
springle sturdy yeah I don't think it's
going<00:03:28.579> you're<00:03:29.120> going<00:03:29.269> to<00:03:29.360> have<00:03:29.480> any<00:03:29.629> any

but it's really sturdy then comes with
two<00:03:40.730> more<00:03:41.109> pieces<00:03:43.000> this<00:03:44.000> one<00:03:44.180> I'll<00:03:44.299> just<00:03:44.480> pull

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
two more pieces this one I'll just pull

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.349 
two more pieces this one I'll just pull
it<00:03:44.959> up<00:03:45.079> here<00:03:45.290> so<00:03:45.470> you<00:03:45.560> can<00:03:45.680> see<00:03:45.730> again<00:03:46.730> once<00:03:47.269> i

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
put it together i'll do a video showing

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.880 
put it together i'll do a video showing
you<00:03:49.370> how<00:03:49.549> everything<00:03:50.000> works<00:03:50.530> it<00:03:51.530> comes<00:03:51.799> with

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
you how everything works it comes with

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.740 
you how everything works it comes with
instructions<00:03:52.159> so<00:03:52.970> i'm<00:03:53.090> not<00:03:53.239> going<00:03:53.450> to<00:03:53.569> show

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
instructions so i'm not going to show

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.349 
instructions so i'm not going to show
you<00:03:54.400> you<00:03:57.159> me<00:03:58.159> putting<00:03:58.489> it<00:03:58.609> together<00:03:58.790> it's

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
you you me putting it together it's

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.449 
you you me putting it together it's
probably<00:03:59.780> pretty<00:03:59.900> boring<00:04:00.409> but<00:04:00.590> I'll<00:04:01.310> at<00:04:01.430> least

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
probably pretty boring but I'll at least

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.000 
probably pretty boring but I'll at least
show<00:04:01.879> you<00:04:02.170> what<00:04:03.170> it<00:04:03.290> looks<00:04:03.319> like<00:04:03.650> when<00:04:03.859> it's

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
show you what it looks like when it's

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.569 
show you what it looks like when it's
done<00:04:04.250> and<00:04:05.349> do<00:04:06.349> a<00:04:06.379> review<00:04:06.859> so<00:04:07.129> you<00:04:07.189> know<00:04:07.430> exactly

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
done and do a review so you know exactly

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.210 
done and do a review so you know exactly
how<00:04:08.030> it<00:04:08.180> works<00:04:08.389> I<00:04:08.750> just<00:04:09.379> want<00:04:09.530> to<00:04:09.590> see<00:04:09.739> what's

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
how it works I just want to see what's

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.929 
how it works I just want to see what's
in<00:04:10.400> here<00:04:10.689> does<00:04:11.689> anything<00:04:11.930> special<00:04:12.349> or<00:04:12.620> not<00:04:12.939> and

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:13.939 
in here does anything special or not and

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:20.050 
in here does anything special or not and
then<00:04:14.030> we'll<00:04:14.209> get<00:04:14.359> to<00:04:14.569> the<00:04:14.689> actual<00:04:15.049> set<00:04:17.079> no<00:04:19.060> not

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
then we'll get to the actual set no not

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.640 
then we'll get to the actual set no not
sure<00:04:20.239> what<00:04:20.419> it<00:04:20.539> is<00:04:20.570> drawing<00:04:21.199> something<00:04:21.440> like

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
sure what it is drawing something like

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.680 
sure what it is drawing something like
this<00:04:21.859> but<00:04:22.130> anyway<00:04:22.460> these<00:04:22.669> are<00:04:22.729> the<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.449> three

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
this but anyway these are the the three

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:30.310 
this but anyway these are the the three
pieces<00:04:26.680> they<00:04:27.680> give<00:04:27.889> you<00:04:28.090> hex<00:04:29.090> key<00:04:29.389> and<00:04:29.720> all<00:04:30.169> of

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
pieces they give you hex key and all of

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.820 
pieces they give you hex key and all of
the<00:04:30.940> nuts<00:04:31.940> and<00:04:32.120> bolts<00:04:32.330> that<00:04:33.320> you'll<00:04:33.530> need<00:04:33.680> to

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
the nuts and bolts that you'll need to

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.290 
the nuts and bolts that you'll need to
put<00:04:33.949> it<00:04:34.070> together<00:04:34.190> now<00:04:36.789> go<00:04:37.789> to<00:04:37.849> the<00:04:38.000> actual

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
put it together now go to the actual

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:54.879 
put it together now go to the actual
weights

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.260 

so<00:04:55.889> I<00:04:56.190> already<00:04:56.430> knew<00:04:56.729> it<00:04:56.819> was<00:04:56.909> going<00:04:57.090> to<00:04:57.180> be

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
so I already knew it was going to be

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.649 
so I already knew it was going to be
classic<00:04:58.759> but<00:04:59.759> it<00:05:00.030> actually<00:05:00.180> feels<00:05:00.479> pretty

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:00.659 
classic but it actually feels pretty

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:03.200 
classic but it actually feels pretty
good<00:05:01.280> you<00:05:02.280> know<00:05:02.430> just<00:05:02.610> touching<00:05:03.060> it<00:05:03.150> and

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
good you know just touching it and

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.899 
good you know just touching it and
moving<00:05:03.810> it<00:05:03.960> like<00:05:04.169> that<00:05:04.379> it<00:05:05.099> really<00:05:05.159> bolted<00:05:05.789> it

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:05.909 
moving it like that it really bolted it

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:07.339 
moving it like that it really bolted it
down<00:05:06.060> pretty<00:05:06.330> good<00:05:06.569> I<00:05:06.840> guess<00:05:06.900> they<00:05:07.169> want<00:05:07.319> to

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
down pretty good I guess they want to

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:08.869 
down pretty good I guess they want to
make<00:05:07.409> sure<00:05:07.530> something<00:05:08.009> as<00:05:08.250> heavy<00:05:08.460> doesn't

00:05:08.869 --> 00:05:08.879 
make sure something as heavy doesn't

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:23.629 
make sure something as heavy doesn't
move<00:05:09.629> off<00:05:09.900> and<00:05:10.229> transport<00:05:22.400> so<00:05:23.400> i'm<00:05:23.460> not<00:05:23.580> sure

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
move off and transport so i'm not sure

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:28.040 
move off and transport so i'm not sure
to<00:05:23.970> lock<00:05:24.180> down<00:05:24.389> or<00:05:24.599> anything<00:05:26.330> pull<00:05:27.330> it<00:05:27.479> okay

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
to lock down or anything pull it okay

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:35.089 
to lock down or anything pull it okay
it's<00:05:29.030> not<00:05:30.030> locked<00:05:30.270> down<00:05:33.530> all<00:05:34.530> right<00:05:34.620> it<00:05:34.919> looks

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099 
it's not locked down all right it looks

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:37.159 
it's not locked down all right it looks
like<00:05:35.219> it's<00:05:35.400> it<00:05:35.610> just<00:05:35.759> use<00:05:36.030> two<00:05:36.210> pieces<00:05:36.419> you

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
like it's it just use two pieces you

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.610 
like it's it just use two pieces you
have<00:05:37.199> a<00:05:37.349> plate<00:05:38.300> all<00:05:39.300> the<00:05:39.509> weight<00:05:39.659> goes<00:05:39.690> in<00:05:40.229> then

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
have a plate all the weight goes in then

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:05.849 
all right well I'm gonna have to get get

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:11.029 
all right well I'm gonna have to get get
used<00:06:06.090> to<00:06:06.240> that<00:06:09.110> so<00:06:10.110> this<00:06:10.500> is<00:06:10.529> what<00:06:10.770> it<00:06:10.860> looks

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 
used to that so this is what it looks

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:13.309 
used to that so this is what it looks
like<00:06:11.159> if<00:06:11.340> you<00:06:11.430> just<00:06:11.639> want<00:06:11.819> four<00:06:12.060> pounds<00:06:12.539> which

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:13.319 
like if you just want four pounds which

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:16.269 
like if you just want four pounds which
is<00:06:13.349> just<00:06:13.770> the<00:06:14.029> bar<00:06:15.029> by<00:06:15.240> itself<00:06:15.599> no<00:06:15.960> wait

00:06:16.269 --> 00:06:16.279 
is just the bar by itself no wait

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:19.370 
is just the bar by itself no wait
included<00:06:17.279> and<00:06:18.150> it<00:06:18.690> looks<00:06:18.870> like<00:06:18.930> it's<00:06:19.050> pretty

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
included and it looks like it's pretty

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.980 
included and it looks like it's pretty
easy<00:06:19.650> to<00:06:20.719> to<00:06:21.719> change<00:06:21.930> what<00:06:22.289> you<00:06:22.380> want<00:06:22.729> and<00:06:23.990> a

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
easy to to change what you want and a

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.990 
easy to to change what you want and a
good<00:06:25.169> thing<00:06:25.379> is<00:06:25.560> unlike<00:06:26.190> I<00:06:26.460> believe<00:06:26.789> it's<00:06:26.940> the

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
good thing is unlike I believe it's the

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.129 
good thing is unlike I believe it's the
bowflex<00:06:27.479> model<00:06:27.930> you<00:06:29.539> only<00:06:30.539> have<00:06:30.690> to<00:06:30.719> turn<00:06:30.990> on

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139 
bowflex model you only have to turn on

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:33.050 
bowflex model you only have to turn on
one<00:06:31.319> side<00:06:31.529> where<00:06:32.190> the<00:06:32.279> bowflex<00:06:32.669> when<00:06:32.849> I<00:06:32.879> think

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
one side where the bowflex when I think

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.369 
one side where the bowflex when I think
has<00:06:33.150> a<00:06:33.180> turn<00:06:33.419> on<00:06:33.449> both<00:06:33.750> sides<00:06:34.020> so<00:06:34.199> if<00:06:34.289> you're

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:34.379 
has a turn on both sides so if you're

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:35.510 
has a turn on both sides so if you're
doing<00:06:34.590> a<00:06:34.650> workout<00:06:34.949> that<00:06:35.129> could<00:06:35.250> probably<00:06:35.340> be

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
doing a workout that could probably be

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.510 
doing a workout that could probably be
pretty<00:06:35.789> annoying<00:06:36.599> and<00:06:36.930> time-consuming<00:06:37.520> and

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
pretty annoying and time-consuming and

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.559 
pretty annoying and time-consuming and
yeah<00:06:38.759> here's<00:06:39.300> 25<00:06:39.779> all<00:06:40.409> right<00:06:40.590> so<00:06:41.569> that's

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:42.569 
yeah here's 25 all right so that's

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:44.869 
yeah here's 25 all right so that's
pretty<00:06:42.930> much<00:06:43.110> it<00:06:43.169> for<00:06:43.349> the<00:06:43.590> unboxing<00:06:43.879> the

00:06:44.869 --> 00:06:44.879 
pretty much it for the unboxing the

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:49.369 
pretty much it for the unboxing the
 line<00:06:45.360> this<00:06:45.479> backdrop<00:06:48.379> hopefully

00:06:49.369 --> 00:06:49.379 
 line this backdrop hopefully

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:52.760 
 line this backdrop hopefully
I'll<00:06:49.529> get<00:06:50.099> used<00:06:50.340> to<00:06:50.460> doing<00:06:50.969> that<00:06:51.529> rocket<00:06:52.529> into

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:52.770 
I'll get used to doing that rocket into

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:53.310 
I'll get used to doing that rocket into

40
I'm<00:06:53.590> not<00:06:53.770> using<00:06:54.010> it<00:06:54.280> just<00:06:54.520> so<00:06:55.470> everything

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:56.470 
I'm not using it just so everything

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.340 
I'm not using it just so everything
stays<00:06:56.740> together<00:06:57.150> but<00:06:58.150> it<00:06:58.270> feels<00:06:58.540> sturdy

00:06:59.340 --> 00:06:59.350 
stays together but it feels sturdy

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.700 
stays together but it feels sturdy
enough<00:06:59.560> right<00:06:59.890> now<00:06:59.920> to<00:07:00.070> to<00:07:00.760> use<00:07:00.970> and<00:07:01.590> you<00:07:02.590> know
