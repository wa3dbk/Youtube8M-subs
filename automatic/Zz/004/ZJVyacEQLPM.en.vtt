00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
come off so this is the stop that's been

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.160 
come off so this is the stop that's been
on<00:00:58.350> here<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:59.219> kind<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.850> comes<00:01:00.059> off<00:01:00.420> in

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
on here the kind that comes off in

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:09.380 
on here the kind that comes off in
pieces<00:01:01.649> or<00:01:02.219> watch<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:07.430> that<00:01:08.430> just<00:01:08.760> falls<00:01:09.119> off

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
pieces or watch this that just falls off

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.070 
pieces or watch this that just falls off
I<00:01:09.860> mean<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:10.979> just<00:01:11.010> that's<00:01:11.630> that's<00:01:12.630> about<00:01:12.869> as

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
I mean that just that's that's about as

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.469 
I mean that just that's that's about as
easy<00:01:13.260> as<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.590> gets<00:01:13.770> for<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.070> side<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.700> and

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
the toilet brush yeah this is what for

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.160 
the toilet brush yeah this is what for
literally<00:01:41.820> just<00:01:42.030> going<00:01:42.299> around<00:01:42.360> rivets<00:01:42.990> and

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
literally just going around rivets and

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.730 
literally just going around rivets and
other<00:01:43.460> bits<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.700> are<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.119> way<00:01:45.740> that's

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
other bits that are in the way that's

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.960 
other bits that are in the way that's
what<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.189> do<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:48.049> so<00:01:49.049> before<00:01:49.430> this<00:01:50.430> was<00:01:50.939> a

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
what you do to it so before this was a

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.969 
what you do to it so before this was a
very<00:01:51.299> difficult<00:01:51.899> thing<00:01:52.170> because<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.770> Sun

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
very difficult thing because the Sun

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.219 
very difficult thing because the Sun
wouldn't<00:01:53.250> stick<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.299> goop<00:01:54.930> wouldn't

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
wouldn't stick to this the goop wouldn't

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.819 
wouldn't stick to this the goop wouldn't
stick<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.649> side<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.820> perfect<00:01:57.030> here<00:01:57.360> no

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
stick to the side is it perfect here no

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.719 
stick to the side is it perfect here no
but<00:01:58.829> not<00:01:59.460> bad<00:01:59.899> all<00:02:00.899> things<00:02:00.930> considered

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
but not bad all things considered

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.719 
but not bad all things considered
because<00:02:02.729> it's<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.000> vertical<00:02:03.180> service<00:02:03.840> surface

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
because it's a vertical service surface

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.630 
because it's a vertical service surface
I<00:02:06.530> think<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.680> concoction<00:02:08.190> works<00:02:08.369> pretty<00:02:08.520> good

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
I think the concoction works pretty good

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.809 
I think the concoction works pretty good
and<00:02:08.970> it's<00:02:09.750> it's<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.440> very<00:02:10.470> very<00:02:11.310> inexpensive

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
and it's it's a very very inexpensive

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.110 
and it's it's a very very inexpensive
way<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.300> do<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:13.500> just<00:02:13.530> have<00:02:13.739> to<00:02:14.190> watch<00:02:14.819> your

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
way to do it you just have to watch your

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.420 
way to do it you just have to watch your
choice<00:02:15.390> ask<00:02:16.349> for<00:02:16.560> permission<00:02:16.950> or<00:02:17.069> beg<00:02:17.220> for

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
choice ask for permission or beg for

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.210 
choice ask for permission or beg for
