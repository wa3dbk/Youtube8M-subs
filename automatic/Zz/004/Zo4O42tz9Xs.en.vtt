00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
out the first video of today as well but

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.140 
out the first video of today as well but
basically<00:00:13.230> we've<00:00:13.500> got<00:00:13.679> 350<00:00:14.250> k-pax<00:00:14.820> which<00:00:15.030> is

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
basically we've got 350 k-pax which is

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.460 
basically we've got 350 k-pax which is
essentially<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.599> same<00:00:15.809> as<00:00:15.960> one<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.440> half

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
essentially the same as one and a half

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.010 
essentially the same as one and a half
100<00:00:17.190> k-pax<00:00:17.640> so<00:00:18.180> it's<00:00:18.330> harder<00:00:18.630> coins<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.930> be

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
100 k-pax so it's harder coins to be

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.000 
100 k-pax so it's harder coins to be
standing<00:00:19.320> on<00:00:19.380> some<00:00:19.560> packs<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:19.920> would

on<00:02:43.510> for<00:02:43.780> that<00:02:44.010> so<00:02:45.010> unbeknownst<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.670> me<00:02:45.820> this<00:02:45.940> is

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
on for that so unbeknownst to me this is

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.760

actually<00:02:46.330> a<00:02:46.390> second<00:02:46.810> inform<00:02:47.140> so<00:02:47.290> I<00:02:47.320> was<00:02:47.500> hoping

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
actually a second inform so I was hoping

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:48.990 
actually a second inform so I was hoping
that<00:02:47.920> it'd<00:02:48.010> be<00:02:48.070> worth<00:02:48.250> a<00:02:48.340> lot<00:02:48.490> when<00:02:48.910> I<00:02:48.940> was

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
that it'd be worth a lot when I was

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.370 
that it'd be worth a lot when I was
clicking<00:02:49.270> on<00:02:49.420> his<00:02:49.510> name<00:02:49.660> bridge<00:02:49.870> actually<00:02:50.080> on

clicking on his name bridge actually on

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.040 
clicking on his name bridge actually on
it<00:02:50.500> goes<00:02:50.620> for<00:02:51.400> about<00:02:51.430> 20<00:02:52.330> k<00:02:52.510> which<00:02:52.750> is<00:02:52.900> pretty

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
it goes for about 20 k which is pretty

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.380 
it goes for about 20 k which is pretty
disappointing<00:02:53.709> but<00:02:53.890> maybe<00:02:54.580> with<00:02:54.970> path<00:02:55.180> luck

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390
