now let's let's have a look for wait we
did<00:00:23.100> max<00:00:23.369> because<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.119> know<00:00:24.240> he's<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.390> skilled

did max because you know he's a skilled
warrior<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.350> who<00:00:25.439> doesn't<00:00:25.740> like<00:00:25.830> buff<00:00:26.099> guys<00:00:26.390> a

skin<00:00:28.349> tone<00:00:28.650> was<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> little<00:00:29.279> bit<00:00:29.429> darker<00:00:29.789> than

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
skin tone was a little bit darker than

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.890 
skin tone was a little bit darker than
normal

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
normal

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.170 
normal
I<00:00:30.929> think<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:31.890> had<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.219> color<00:00:32.489> actually<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:33.090> was

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
I think I had this color actually it was

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.450 
I think I had this color actually it was
a<00:00:33.210> Goldy<00:00:33.690> sort<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.050> maybe<00:00:34.710> actually<00:00:35.250> maybe

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
a Goldy sort of maybe actually maybe

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.610 
a Goldy sort of maybe actually maybe
that<00:00:35.640> was<00:00:35.730> another<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.210> think<00:00:36.960> about<00:00:37.050> this<00:00:37.230> skin

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
that was another I think about this skin

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.360 
that was another I think about this skin
tone<00:00:37.700> as<00:00:39.829> for<00:00:40.829> complexion<00:00:41.930> old<00:00:42.980> definitely<00:00:43.980> we

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
tone as for complexion old definitely we

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.080 
tone as for complexion old definitely we
had<00:00:44.579> old

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
had old

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.959 
had old
so<00:00:45.539> that's<00:00:45.809> default<00:00:46.350> for<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.620> preset<00:00:47.190> on

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
so that's default for this preset on

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.910 
so that's default for this preset on
let's<00:00:48.300> just<00:00:48.450> get<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.690> hair<00:00:48.899> done<00:00:48.930> first<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:49.890> I

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
let's just get the hair done first so I

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.950 
let's just get the hair done first so I
can<00:00:50.039> know<00:00:50.309> what<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.090> can<00:00:51.210> get<00:00:51.329> my<00:00:51.510> bearings

facial hair we wanted a long bead
because<00:01:20.990> you<00:01:21.990> can<00:01:22.260> do<00:01:22.440> this<00:01:22.620> one<00:01:23.780> but<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.840> think

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
because you can do this one but I think

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.420 
because you can do this one but I think
I<00:01:25.140> went<00:01:25.260> with<00:01:25.440> that<00:01:25.620> one<00:01:26.510> hair<00:01:27.510> color

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
I went with that one hair color

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.790 
I went with that one hair color
pure<00:01:29.430> white<00:01:29.700> we<00:01:30.600> want<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.870> make<00:01:30.990> him<00:01:31.110> old<00:01:31.410> and

pure white we want to make him old and

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
wise looking now the only difference was

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.040 
wise looking now the only difference was
really<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.580> I<00:01:38.580> think<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.030> picked<00:01:39.270> some<00:01:39.479> nicer

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
really is I think I picked some nicer

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.000 
really is I think I picked some nicer
brows<00:01:40.410> and<00:01:41.330> I<00:01:42.330> did<00:01:42.570> not<00:01:42.750> do<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.020> what<00:01:43.619> have<00:01:43.890> I

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
brows and I did not do that what have I

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.700 
brows and I did not do that what have I
done

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.859 

actually<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.830> know<00:01:49.950> what<00:01:50.270> you<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.510> leave<00:01:51.720> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
actually you know what you can leave the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.330 
actually you know what you can leave the
default<00:01:52.050> mouth<00:01:52.470> but<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.770> want<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:52.979> leave<00:01:53.130> this

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
default mouth but I want to leave this

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.160 
default mouth but I want to leave this
mouth<00:01:53.640> gonna<00:01:54.240> leave<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.479> mouth<00:01:54.840> I

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
mouth gonna leave that mouth I

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.840 
mouth gonna leave that mouth I
accidentally<00:01:55.800> did<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.070> but<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.340> sort<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.790> looks

accidentally did it but it sort of looks

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.210 
accidentally did it but it sort of looks
okay<00:01:57.330> and<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.570> think<00:01:57.780> that's<00:01:57.930> sort<00:01:58.080> of<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.320> it's<00:01:59.130> a

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
okay and I think that's sort of a it's a

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.340 
okay and I think that's sort of a it's a
nice<00:01:59.400> mistake<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.000> if<00:02:00.150> not<00:02:00.450> leave<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.900> default

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
nice mistake so if not leave the default

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.100 
nice mistake so if not leave the default
mouth<00:02:01.590> if<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.310> don't<00:02:02.610> like<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:03.060> one<00:02:03.119> because

not change his eye shape so this is the
ultimatum<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.360> maybe<00:02:24.570> I<00:02:25.160> should<00:02:26.160> have<00:02:26.250> had<00:02:26.340> a

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
ultimatum and maybe I should have had a

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.680 
ultimatum and maybe I should have had a
good<00:02:26.580> look<00:02:26.730> at<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:26.970> character<00:02:27.330> maybe<00:02:27.510> his

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
good look at the character maybe his

this<00:02:37.950> one<00:02:38.160> for<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.430> time<00:02:38.670> being<00:02:42.680> hmm<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:44.070> you

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
this one for the time being hmm and you

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.220 
this one for the time being hmm and you
know<00:02:44.430> what<00:02:44.610> else<00:02:44.730> I<00:02:45.030> don't<00:02:45.540> think<00:02:45.720> we<00:02:45.810> like<00:02:46.019> his

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230

it was a bit less I think it was like a
6<00:02:51.290> 6<00:02:52.290> 5
