00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
side right here but still kind of that

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.620 
side right here but still kind of that
straight<00:02:26.130> up<00:02:26.310> straight<00:02:26.550> down<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:27.120> middle<00:02:27.150> but

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
straight up straight down the middle but

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.350

over<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.080> side<00:02:28.320> just<00:02:28.710> enough<00:02:29.120> so<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.150> if

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
over to the side just enough so that if

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.850 
over to the side just enough so that if
they<00:02:30.480> dive<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:30.930> just<00:02:31.110> goes<00:02:31.260> right<00:02:31.440> over<00:02:31.500> him

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860

they dive it just goes right over him
it's<00:02:31.980> pretty<00:02:32.160> cheesy<00:02:32.520> penalty<00:02:33.300> kick<00:02:33.450> tactic

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
it's pretty cheesy penalty kick tactic

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.180

and<00:02:33.990> he<00:02:34.080> does<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.350> same<00:02:34.380> thing<00:02:34.770> right<00:02:34.920> there

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
and he does the same thing right there

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.100 
and he does the same thing right there
and<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.850> can<00:02:35.970> see<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.120> don't<00:02:36.330> dive<00:02:36.630> any<00:02:36.840> more<00:02:37.020> on

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
and you can see I don't dive any more on

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.600 
and you can see I don't dive any more on
penalties<00:02:37.500> for<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:37.770> most<00:02:37.920> part<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.220> just<00:02:38.400> slide

lovely penalty that would have been
blocked<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.210> be<00:02:57.330> dove<00:02:57.600> it<00:02:57.780> wasn't<00:02:58.080> exactly

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
blocked to be dove it wasn't exactly

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.780 
blocked to be dove it wasn't exactly
where<00:02:58.740> I<00:02:58.770> wanted<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.100> go<00:02:59.190> over<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.400> worked<00:02:59.640> out

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790

where I wanted to go over to worked out
that<00:03:00.030> time<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.630> think<00:03:01.410> he's<00:03:01.590> gonna<00:03:01.710> switch<00:03:02.010> it

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
that time I think he's gonna switch it

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.760 
that time I think he's gonna switch it
up<00:03:02.280> he<00:03:02.520> does<00:03:02.760> not<00:03:03.210> so<00:03:03.780> claim<00:03:04.080> those<00:03:04.350> penalty

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
up he does not so claim those penalty

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.380 
up he does not so claim those penalty

but<00:03:10.980> going<00:03:11.250> into<00:03:11.460> penalty<00:03:11.790> this<00:03:11.850> is<00:03:12.030> just<00:03:12.240> fun

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570

but going into penalty this is just fun
you<00:03:13.260> think<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:13.590> could<00:03:13.740> figure<00:03:13.890> out<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.160> sort<00:03:14.490> of

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
you think you could figure out a sort of

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.010 
you think you could figure out a sort of
pattern<00:03:14.880> here<00:03:15.090> if<00:03:15.180> we<00:03:15.270> managed<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.570> block<00:03:15.810> this

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
pattern here if we managed to block this

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.600 
pattern here if we managed to block this
woman<00:03:16.260> be<00:03:16.350> in<00:03:16.410> all<00:03:16.530> sorts<00:03:16.860> of<00:03:16.920> good<00:03:17.070> shape<00:03:17.370> and

we<00:03:17.670> do<00:03:18.420> figured<00:03:19.020> he'd<00:03:19.110> have<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.560> come<00:03:19.709> back

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
we do figured he'd have to come back

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.640 
we do figured he'd have to come back
over<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.850> he<00:03:20.940> did<00:03:21.209> so<00:03:21.540> for<00:03:21.570> two<00:03:22.080> we<00:03:22.290> take<00:03:22.470> the

over and he did so for two we take the

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.830 
over and he did so for two we take the
