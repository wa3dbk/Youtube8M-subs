00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:15.000
 hi youtubers and welcome new year 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:17.100
 makeup tutorial salve youtubers for the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.570
 extremely colorful tricks series 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.590
 let's put all the colors into it 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.289
 possible and imaginable 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.820
 here I am with an extremely trick 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.160
 colored with all possible colors 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.560
 imagine less I'm not all missing 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.560
 at least in blue, blue is blue 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.940
 these colors here, however, have conjugated a 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.140
 neon orange with violet and a green mi 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.600
 I really like the idea 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.540
 very much the contrast hopes for makeup 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.570
 you like it I hope it's inspirational 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.800
 as I always say in every video 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.399
 I really like it very much 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.320
 because exaggerated without being 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.180
 exaggeratedly exaggerated ie exaggerated 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.550
 in colors in the double line or wool 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.379
 but it is not one of those tricks that go 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.760
 up to the eyebrow or whatever 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.399
 so much in the fold of the eye 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.500
 even 30 km away you can see that you have 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.369
 just a great form of makeup the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.630
 makeup is little but extremely wright already 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.310
 switched on 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.990
 let me know what you think about it with a 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.900
 comment below and I recommend it 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.369
 keep watching this tutorial 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.110
 creates the finished makeup from near to 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.180
 near you can see much more than values 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.070
 they are beautiful vibrant and strong 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.720
 start as always by applying a primer 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.460
 I remind you that all the products that 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.650
 use for my tricks are like 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.450
 always summarized in the info box below 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.159
 this video the first eye shadow that 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.049
 use a white goatee eye shadow go 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.220
 any brand well and apply it 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.840
 on the eyebrow arch 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.780
 the protagonist of this trick 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.060
 obviously a neon orange matt and it 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.079
 I apply with a flat brush in the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.079
 first half of the eyelid 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.140
 I can now the white pencil this trick 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.789
 in reality it is not a trick with two lines 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.679
 runners but rather a type with one 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.060
 white line that divides the part 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:56.219
 upper is the lower part of 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.360
 eye also with the most white pencil 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.770
 what else in the inner corner e 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.109
 in the outer corner in the inner corner 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.090
 I go further down and into the corner 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:05.189
 I go outside of course to make a line 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.840
 diagonal upwards in the center 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.819
 on the other hand, I am just keeping an eye on myself 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.049
 in the inner rim of the eye 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.760
 so I make the angle 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.620
 internal were external rejoin 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.500
 only in the inner rim of the eye 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.299
 in this way the natural line of the 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.880
 my eye will not seem too much anymore 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:23.840
 damaged but much more upturned e 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.840
 much more straight 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.680
 they can launch neon even below 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.480
 the eye therefore I practically go to 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.500
 enclose the white line inside 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.500
 of orange tuc 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.960
 over the eye instead made fade 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.540
 slightly burgundy orange 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.760
 with a clean brush to fade between 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.370
 launch the violet use a brown 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.459
 he also sings a little to dampen the look 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.319
 otherwise a little too flashy then 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.270
 open with a little brown in the second 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.130
 part of the eye I leave the corner empty 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.750
 exterior blurring between the brown 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.700
 orange in the central part 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.770
 of the eye and shades of brown 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.770
 also upwards and passes purple 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.989
 around using with a brush 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.209
 angled because it does it to use its own 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.709
 as if it were from the line to the tail 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.709
 final right above the white 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:33.209
 after which however spinball also violates 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:35.939
 inside the brown with a little brush 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:40.010
 clean I blur the purple always doing it 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:40.010
 same movement v in the outer corner 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.849
 under longhi 8 to add another 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.379
 color this time a green is the deed 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.010
 which of course immediately below the line 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.010
 of white pencil 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.550
 smoke in the green of the orange I can 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.950
 another bit of white just outside 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.720
 of the orange between the inner corner the 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.150
 nose in this desire from orange 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.160
 it will be even more vibrant corally 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:23.470
 we have practically finished and we pass 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:25.420
 to the LAN and I don't want the line to be 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.170
 too important otherwise it would cover 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.170
 too much my game 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.680
 apcom patina also came under 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.110
 the eye on the green is not just proper 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.520
 in the final part of the eye not in the 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.720
 final part of the tail I want 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.240
 simply add some 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.410
 depth so eyeliner does not bleed 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.360
 I want you to see black I want 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.400
 simply that there is a shadow one 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.520
 slightly darker part passes 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.540
 false eyelashes were not here too 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:13.900
 curved is too high and therefore not 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.900
 will cover the mascara makeup 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.810
 the trick is over i hope there is 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.850
 liked 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.630
 See you at the next video kisses in the 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.630
 black lipsic
