00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.810
 speaks good guys all confessed ps 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.700
 renan who takes a look for a car 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.810
 I fixed the ceiling of mine that 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.580
 It's a lie, I'm here in the car of the martyr. 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.230
 He brought the car to give a 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.880
 look that doing some problems of 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.280
 injection and the car is 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.290
 holding the idle and then I asked 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.570
 permission for him to show you 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.250
 How I going to solve this problem? 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.280
 was taking a look at the car 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.579
 now waiting for the engine to cool slightly 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.620
 was able to adjust the tps of the 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.720
 insurer and goal I already showed you 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.120
 see in the videos that we are going to give a 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.430
 come back later to see if it really 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.890
 fixed the car to see what we people 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.540
 can do later also good then it is 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.489
 This will follow, I'll show you 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.880
 I I'm doing here in the safe 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.880
 of the engine 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.179
 The good thing is that I have seen so far that the sensor 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.729
 gps it is smaller than the 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:20.670
 standard even we remember the actor there 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.799
 pro working out so I will make the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.619
 adjustment of tps in a few more 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.799
 Connector problems are some of the 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:32.100
 connectors are broken or with a 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.539
 type of clasps hold but then I go 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.179
 see what we can do 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.990
 First or only, I'll ask you to 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:39.439
 people watch 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.349
 and then clean the connectors and 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:45.780
 all the pines to see if it improves 

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:48.030
 here's the car 's idle situation 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.969
 Good folks, it's going to start regulating. 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.929
 aquino in the car of the sea, above all people 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:57.629
 is looking at the tps only that it is with the 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.340
 measured at 0 reminded that tirone 

00:01:57.629 --> 00:02:03.149
 only he is not making it to the 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.009
 measure of a volt in 2010 even with the 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:10.170
 tps that in woman 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:13.680
 as it remains at most 10 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:19.290
 60's as far as it goes for everything 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:22.430
 only that what we have seen so far 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.020
 little chicken that has 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.240
 it has already been modified 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.190
 then someone has already traded that 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.900
 original is black that her itamar and he 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.959
 so probably also installed 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.230
 analog dance album in which it ruins 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:40.170
 to see if it works that has here a 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.780
 Another bm sensor 11 are new and we 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.360
 Go take a look, put the team to 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.209
 we see people coming back we go 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.100
 take a look pleasure but is the sensor 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.590
 any problem then that is original 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.400
 who was in the car is giving 10 11 02 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.530
 good 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.530
 The key was on now. 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.420
 is the sensor name of ds is giving the same 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.670
 value of 0 13 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.370
 so many people complaining that the 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.250
 boss of the employee and this may be that 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.160
 problem that someone deregulated the 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.890
 he has ability and not the census to 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.110
 people are seeing that the sensor comparing 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.190
 meeting was in the car has a 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.850
 voltage 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:36.130
 I'm going to do it now, it's like this. 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.739
 clean accelerator that we are going to give a 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.480
 look to see if the advantage of the 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.440
 sensor when we reconnect new 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.600
 old 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.150
 Good guys unfortunately it was not a 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.340
 problem no angle problem 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.350
 aligned sensor truck 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.940
 it was just a problem of lack of regulation 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.590
 here is born of the accelerator 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.930
 we were able to put the sensor 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.940
 back and then no one here I have 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.459
 car is still not what it is. 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.800
 from ds but she was in the car that I 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:07.239
 I got here in 1.15 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:09.519
 one hour I'll still make the squeeze 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.950
 friends four screws to leave 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.690
 sensor in place we still have to 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.150
 expect the car will be a little that 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.729
 is a little bit that finally the ideal for 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.109
 People do reset with a motor 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:21.940
 totally cold right? 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.830
 and we will call the car later 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.060
 he then alone to a regular back 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.789
 to see how it got 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:31.169
 but fortunately I managed to find the problem 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:31.169
 there and to be resolved 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.390
 Good guys, interview, this is me. 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.800
 I have recorded much of the procedure 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.770
 People kept talking that they were giving 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.680
 mazzeo also for more and now the car 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.790
 it became ideal to idle grinding wheel 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.040
 right 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.680
 It's what I do not know for you there . 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.440
 butterfly angle was right 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.630
 the problem is that is was regulated 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.970
 have a child to the top on the screw 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:11.180
 interior then it was not coming 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:13.280
 Right odor idle and 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.810
 and the assertive adjustment of the 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.760
 potential of ds 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.740
 We did a battery reset like I did. 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.970
 I do not know that you are not born there. 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.870
 individuals such as regular and 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.750
 electronics 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.130
 the car has warmed his car has air 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.550
 conditioning is much better than 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.620
 I had never seen him regulated. 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:34.960
 cute and now idle is 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:37.610
 Regulated, I'll call to show you. 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.529
 I'm going to put the camera to give a 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:45.089
 look at the 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:48.269
 is not convinced that you see is the 

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:51.509
 rotation pointer here but he is 

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:53.819
 economic ideal stayed a little bit is to 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:55.649
 the middle front is indicating that it has 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:56.849
 some problem even more like me 

00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:58.619
 I spoke with the marcinho vp that walks 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:02.519
 putting some rivers for injection 

00:05:58.619 --> 00:06:04.709
 electronics is this problem or if 

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:05.879
 It's for you here now how was the 

00:06:04.709 --> 00:06:07.949
 clothes on the field 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:10.999
 here you can take a look not only 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:14.459
 is nearly 800 rotations that the rotation 

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:16.529
 is the idle speed of the type that will turn on 

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:17.999
 the fan will consume a little 

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:21.629
 energy goes down a little bit 

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:22.259
 rotation but the car stayed at zero bullet 

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:24.569
 guys 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:26.219
 He had not been able to clean the car. 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:27.239
 and he brought it here to give 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:29.609
 a little look 

00:06:27.239 --> 00:06:30.809
 unfortunately we managed to give a 

00:06:29.609 --> 00:06:32.989
 way in the car 

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:35.839
 The cute one can now go on a trip. 

00:06:32.989 --> 00:06:37.979
 quiet 

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:40.529
 good then just hope you 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:42.209
 video is a good experience. 

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:44.729
 different because I got a car from 

00:06:42.209 --> 00:06:46.559
 a stranger is not my car I 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:48.779
 I'm going to mess around, but I hope he has 

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:49.949
 be happy there with the service and give 

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:52.289
 all right in the car 

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:54.089
 You liked the river, did I like it? 

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:55.829
 If you have any doubt, you can leave 

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:58.199
 You in the comments that I am going to give 

00:06:55.829 --> 00:07:00.809
 a look and of course if you liked it 

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:03.589
 forget to share it right 

00:07:00.809 --> 00:07:03.589
 Talk to people, thanks.
