00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.129
 the plans are 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:36.840
 I hope you like it and yes there 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.840
 I would say we start 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.879
 for the first beer you just need 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.620
 a display in the color itself 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.210
 wanted to have, and then you need 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:55.810
 Clothespins and then played 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:58.000
 simply with the costs then take 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.820
 you a hot glue gun or you can 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.010
 also father fixes I believe and take 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.659
 then you just click the fm the 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.659
 Clothespins on your door 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.100
 yes, and then that's all 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.420
 ready and you can not just 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.280
 any important dates on it 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.000
 hang or pictures or any 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.440
 claims 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.860
 that is an idea of ​​the room too 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.860
 decorate 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.850
 but you need it for the next one 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.740
 just an empty jam jar and 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.420
 that just happened the way you want 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.450
 you can use the masking tape around it 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.880
 stick or somehow sharp or white 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.170
 do not stick glitterstones on it 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.170
 Just do it the way you want 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.620
 yes and then you need one 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.660
 fairy lights and that makes it easy 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.240
 in there and there was the fairy lights 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.920
 and put the glass somewhere in yours 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.510
 room and that looks very nice 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.510
 especially if the room is dark 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.209
 for my third decoration idea you need 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.520
 just a picture frame and the power 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.810
 who want to, so to speak then you can 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.830
 forgive that again as you want 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.930
 then you can take any photos 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.580
 create or write on it as a quote 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.470
 or just a white paper 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.420
 insert or make any collage 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.489
 so as you want then you do that 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.350
 Picture frame shut again and that 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.239
 whole could be there as tablets us so for 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.130
 any candles or perfume bottles 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.690
 So and I just like that when something 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:03.390
 she stands on the tray a lot 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:05.270
 neat from four my fourth dtm 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.430
 you meet first of all 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:11.550
 World map from the internet from embsen 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.110
 hard to find because mostly one 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.180
 watermark on it but you are 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.840
 already find one in the year and then 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.060
 stuck the whole printed just stop 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.010
 polystyrene in the year 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.450
 and after you have the whole thing on it 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.190
 has played it just needs to dry briefly 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.989
 and firmly press with it all 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.209
 do not go down again and then 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.730
 Do you need such a hangover , it is believed 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:36.120
 me and so we cut the stop 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.470
 protruding residues from the styrofoam 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.450
 and with the cutter that works 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.830
 somehow very very good so that crumb 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.830
 then not so bad either 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.340
 then you just take a more authoritative 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.900
 Peter white and that sticks the 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.090
 other edge with it all the neat 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.020
 looks and then you can do that somewhere 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.020
 after all, stuck 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.069
 and then you can just do one 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.590
 take pin or rather in the 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.630
 cities and easy in the countries 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.400
 tuck in where you still like to get carried away 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.290
 real or whatsoever bad and then 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.430
 when I'm very beautiful again 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.430
 it's in his room 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:26.550
 you need one for the last beer 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.280
 That's the bag of believers and a candle 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.930
 and yes either as a tealight and 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.970
 make it extra class or pure 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.890
 give them a candle in the glass 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.600
 if you understand that in the year 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.360
 made as I said pure cutting stood 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.310
 survive and transporter finds the 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.040
 candle and then stop it again 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.960
 so pure and yes that they are very beautiful 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.640
 as if that does not contain everything on 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.160
 it is bright in the room then you can see that 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.760
 not so but once it gets dark the 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.760
 very nice 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.120
 the water already in the video I hope that 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.430
 you liked and if so could the 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.660
 Migros like to give all fashions and otherwise 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.460
 I would say that next time 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.290
 video and if they are anything from the 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.030
 Things to do as you have seen 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.180
 that can be the miguel or instagram 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:15.290
 We'll say a photo of it directly 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.290
 until the next video library
