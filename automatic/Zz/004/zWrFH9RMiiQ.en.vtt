00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.959 
about PCI slots AGP PCIe AMR CNR PCMCIA
we<00:00:31.230> need<00:00:31.410> more<00:00:31.560> acronyms<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.279> our<00:00:32.460> industry

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
we need more acronyms in our industry

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.760 
we need more acronyms in our industry
and<00:00:33.090> I'm<00:00:33.480> bringing<00:00:33.899> them<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.350> we'll<00:00:34.649> also

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
and I'm bringing them to you we'll also

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.530 
and I'm bringing them to you we'll also
look<00:00:35.010> at<00:00:35.130> riser<00:00:35.370> cards<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.000> Daughter<00:00:36.149> boards

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
look at riser cards and Daughter boards

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.630 
look at riser cards and Daughter boards
and<00:00:36.660> what<00:00:36.780> those<00:00:36.930> mean<00:00:36.989> -<00:00:37.500> there<00:00:38.070> are<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.309> lot<00:00:38.610> of

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
and what those mean - there are a lot of

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.040 
and what those mean - there are a lot of
different<00:00:39.059> bus<00:00:39.239> slots<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.750> these<00:00:39.870> have

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
different bus slots and these have

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.690 
different bus slots and these have
really<00:00:40.140> evolved<00:00:40.770> through<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:40.980> years<00:00:41.070> all

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
really evolved through the years all

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.610 
really evolved through the years all
kinds<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.390> different<00:00:42.600> acronyms<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.500> you're

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
kinds of different acronyms that you're

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.770 
kinds of different acronyms that you're
gonna<00:00:43.710> find<00:00:44.070> there<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.670> almost<00:00:44.879> get<00:00:45.059> lost<00:00:45.360> in

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
gonna find there you almost get lost in

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.779 
gonna find there you almost get lost in
what<00:00:45.840> all<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.410> these<00:00:46.620> mean<00:00:46.680> but<00:00:47.309> after<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.640> go

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
what all of these mean but after you go

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.639 
what all of these mean but after you go
through<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.059> module<00:00:48.329> you'll<00:00:48.750> see<00:00:49.020> there's

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
through this module you'll see there's

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.590 
through this module you'll see there's
some<00:00:49.800> very<00:00:49.980> obvious<00:00:50.219> standards<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.300> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
some very obvious standards and the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.389 
some very obvious standards and the
names<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:52.079> these<00:00:52.289> standards<00:00:52.770> are<00:00:52.920> pretty

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
names of these standards are pretty

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.770 
names of these standards are pretty
straightforward<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.270> as<00:00:54.390> we<00:00:54.510> step<00:00:54.719> through

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
straightforward so as we step through

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.959 
straightforward so as we step through
hopefully<00:00:55.500> you'll<00:00:56.010> understand<00:00:56.550> more<00:00:56.730> about

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
hopefully you'll understand more about

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.240 
hopefully you'll understand more about
those<00:00:57.149> capabilities<00:00:57.930> before<00:00:58.620> we<00:00:58.920> get<00:00:59.010> into

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
those capabilities before we get into

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.709 
those capabilities before we get into
the<00:00:59.370> specifics<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.210> what<00:01:00.390> all<00:01:00.539> those

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
the specifics of what all those

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.569 
the specifics of what all those
different<00:01:01.230> bus<00:01:01.469> architecture<00:01:01.680> types<00:01:02.340> are

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
different bus architecture types are

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.490 
different bus architecture types are
let's<00:01:03.149> take<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.359> step<00:01:03.600> back<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.199> talk<00:01:04.470> about

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
let's take a step back and talk about

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.980 
let's take a step back and talk about
why<00:01:05.040> we<00:01:05.339> even<00:01:05.549> need<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:05.970> bus<00:01:06.240> architecture<00:01:06.900> in

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
why we even need a bus architecture in

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.960 
why we even need a bus architecture in
our<00:01:07.110> computer<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.650> begin<00:01:07.950> with<00:01:08.159> well<00:01:08.820> you've

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
our computer to begin with well you've

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.780 
our computer to begin with well you've
got<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.450> really<00:01:09.930> city<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.710> Technology<00:01:11.520> here

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
got this really city of Technology here

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.399 
got this really city of Technology here
if<00:01:11.880> you'd<00:01:12.000> look<00:01:12.180> top<00:01:12.450> down<00:01:12.720> on<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.960> motherboard

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
if you'd look top down on a motherboard

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.289 
if you'd look top down on a motherboard
it's<00:01:13.890> almost<00:01:14.189> like<00:01:14.369> we're<00:01:14.520> flying<00:01:14.760> over<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.210> a

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
it's almost like we're flying over in a

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.670 
it's almost like we're flying over in a
plane<00:01:15.540> there's<00:01:15.840> all<00:01:15.960> kinds<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.470> different

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
plane there's all kinds of different

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.890 
plane there's all kinds of different
paths<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.880> take<00:01:18.119> place<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.750> different

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
paths that take place in different

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.230 
paths that take place in different
connections<00:01:19.710> between<00:01:19.950> these<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:21.119> can

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
connections between these and you can

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.929 
connections between these and you can
see<00:01:21.299> places<00:01:21.689> for<00:01:22.080> CPUs<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.890> can<00:01:23.040> see<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.700> bus

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
see places for CPUs you can see the bus

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.359 
see places for CPUs you can see the bus
expansion<00:01:24.930> bus<00:01:25.140> itself<00:01:25.590> where<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.890> plug<00:01:26.250> in

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
expansion bus itself where you plug in

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.460 
expansion bus itself where you plug in
the<00:01:26.490> adapter<00:01:26.580> cards<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.540> if<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.080> look<00:01:28.259> very

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
the adapter cards and if you look very

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.499 
the adapter cards and if you look very
closely<00:01:28.950> at<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.400> motherboard<00:01:29.880> you'll<00:01:30.299> see

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
closely at the motherboard you'll see

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.569 
closely at the motherboard you'll see
these<00:01:30.659> little<00:01:30.720> paths<00:01:31.200> between<00:01:31.740> all<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.250> these

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
these little paths between all of these

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.340 
these little paths between all of these
and<00:01:32.909> that's<00:01:32.970> your<00:01:33.240> bus<00:01:33.390> that's<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.990> way<00:01:34.140> that

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
and that's your bus that's the way that

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.679 
and that's your bus that's the way that
these<00:01:34.470> different<00:01:34.920> devices<00:01:35.540> communicate<00:01:36.540> to

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
these different devices communicate to

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.510 
these different devices communicate to
each<00:01:36.720> other<00:01:37.020> it's<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.740> way<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:37.950> you've<00:01:38.340> got

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
each other it's a way that you've got

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.370 
each other it's a way that you've got

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
paths between these components you've

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.840 
paths between these components you've
also<00:01:40.530> got<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> way<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.979> grow<00:01:41.220> your<00:01:41.430> computer

this<00:01:42.030> way<00:01:42.210> because<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.840> can<00:01:43.079> plug<00:01:43.350> in

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
this way because you can plug in

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.710 
this way because you can plug in
different<00:01:44.070> components<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.060> now<00:01:45.540> they

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
different components and now they

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.990 
different components and now they
automatically<00:01:46.470> connect<00:01:46.890> into<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.399> bus<00:01:47.670> and

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
automatically connect into that bus and

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.969 
automatically connect into that bus and
can<00:01:48.210> now<00:01:48.390> connect<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.079> talk<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.560> memory<00:01:49.860> and

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
can now connect and talk to memory and

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.249 
can now connect and talk to memory and
talk<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.399> CPU<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.090> communicate<00:01:51.990> throughout

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
talk to CPU and communicate throughout

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.810 
talk to CPU and communicate throughout
all<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.470> your<00:01:52.680> system<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.369> really<00:01:53.610> gives

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
all of your system and this really gives

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.450 
all of your system and this really gives
you<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.299> way<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.659> really<00:01:55.170> expand<00:01:55.740> your<00:01:55.860> computer

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
you a way to really expand your computer

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.030 
you a way to really expand your computer
this<00:01:56.729> was<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.060> whole<00:01:57.270> idea<00:01:57.299> behind<00:01:58.040> creating

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
this was the whole idea behind creating

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.160 
this was the whole idea behind creating
standardized<00:01:59.820> buses<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.630> computer<00:02:00.960> is

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
standardized buses and this computer is

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.749 
standardized buses and this computer is
that<00:02:01.320> people<00:02:01.619> could<00:02:01.829> create<00:02:01.950> standardized

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
that people could create standardized

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.810 
that people could create standardized
expansion<00:02:03.509> parts<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.979> can<00:02:05.130> plug<00:02:05.340> in<00:02:05.579> and

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
expansion parts and you can plug in and

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.219 
expansion parts and you can plug in and
know<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.270> what<00:02:06.479> you're<00:02:06.659> plugging<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:07.079> is

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
know that what you're plugging in is

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.779 
know that what you're plugging in is
going<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.380> work<00:02:07.680> with<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.039> bus<00:02:08.220> that's<00:02:08.459> inside

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
going to work with the bus that's inside

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.609 
going to work with the bus that's inside
of<00:02:08.819> your<00:02:09.060> computer<00:02:09.119> if<00:02:09.750> we<00:02:10.200> didn't<00:02:10.530> have

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
of your computer if we didn't have

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.949 
of your computer if we didn't have
standardization<00:02:11.550> there<00:02:12.030> be<00:02:12.180> no<00:02:12.360> way<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:12.599> we

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
standardization there be no way that we

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.750 
standardization there be no way that we
could<00:02:13.140> create<00:02:13.379> the

extra components in the expandability
that<00:02:15.860> we<00:02:15.950> have<00:02:16.189> today<00:02:16.459> with<00:02:16.640> these<00:02:16.790> computers

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
that we have today with these computers

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.170 
that we have today with these computers
and<00:02:18.650> we<00:02:18.739> start<00:02:18.980> talking<00:02:19.159> about<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:19.849> bus

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
and we start talking about a bus

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.240 
and we start talking about a bus
architecture<00:02:20.450> we<00:02:21.079> also<00:02:21.319> refer<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.920> size

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
architecture we also refer to the size

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.179 
architecture we also refer to the size
of<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:22.849> bus<00:02:23.060> it's<00:02:23.629> a<00:02:23.810> 32-bit<00:02:24.470> bus<00:02:24.709> it's<00:02:25.040> a

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:25.189 
of the bus it's a 32-bit bus it's a

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:27.759 
of the bus it's a 32-bit bus it's a
64-bit<00:02:26.030> bus<00:02:26.239> and<00:02:26.599> we<00:02:26.989> refer<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.230> again<00:02:27.590> those

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
64-bit bus and we refer to again those

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.559 
64-bit bus and we refer to again those
number<00:02:28.069> of<00:02:28.189> bits<00:02:28.400> that<00:02:28.579> means<00:02:28.970> how<00:02:29.180> much<00:02:29.360> we're

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
number of bits that means how much we're

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.600 
number of bits that means how much we're
able<00:02:29.750> to<00:02:29.989> send<00:02:30.290> down<00:02:30.500> all<00:02:30.860> at<00:02:31.400> one<00:02:31.579> time

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
able to send down all at one time

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.119 
able to send down all at one time
through<00:02:32.269> this<00:02:32.450> bus<00:02:32.629> architecture<00:02:33.379> the<00:02:33.829> wider

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
through this bus architecture the wider

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.430 
through this bus architecture the wider
the<00:02:34.430> bus<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:35.000> more<00:02:35.360> we<00:02:35.569> can<00:02:35.750> send<00:02:36.019> through<00:02:36.170> and

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
the bus the more we can send through and

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.899 
the bus the more we can send through and
obviously<00:02:36.769> the<00:02:36.950> more<00:02:37.099> bandwidth<00:02:37.579> we're<00:02:37.819> gonna

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:37.909 
obviously the more bandwidth we're gonna

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.050 
obviously the more bandwidth we're gonna
get<00:02:38.239> if<00:02:38.450> our<00:02:38.930> bus<00:02:39.140> is<00:02:39.170> bigger<00:02:39.620> we<00:02:40.400> also<00:02:40.609> talk

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
get if our bus is bigger we also talk

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.869 
get if our bus is bigger we also talk
about<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.690> bus<00:02:41.900> as<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.620> speed<00:02:43.010> that<00:02:43.250> it<00:02:43.310> uses

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
about the bus as the speed that it uses

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.330 
about the bus as the speed that it uses
the<00:02:44.390> clock<00:02:44.689> speed<00:02:45.049> of<00:02:45.109> the<00:02:45.319> bus<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.829> expansion

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
the clock speed of the bus the expansion

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.890 
the clock speed of the bus the expansion
bus<00:02:46.489> has<00:02:46.670> its<00:02:46.849> own<00:02:47.030> clock<00:02:47.299> so<00:02:47.569> everything

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
bus has its own clock so everything

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.080 
bus has its own clock so everything
going<00:02:48.170> over<00:02:48.379> that<00:02:48.620> bus<00:02:48.859> all<00:02:49.220> runs<00:02:49.519> at<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.790> same

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
going over that bus all runs at the same

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.050 
going over that bus all runs at the same
speed<00:02:50.540> we<00:02:51.200> refer<00:02:51.739> to<00:02:51.769> these<00:02:52.159> speeds<00:02:52.549> as<00:02:52.790> things

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
speed we refer to these speeds as things

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.080 
speed we refer to these speeds as things
called<00:02:53.329> cycles<00:02:54.139> per<00:02:54.379> second<00:02:54.859> or<00:02:54.980> Hertz<00:02:55.370> which

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
called cycles per second or Hertz which

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.210 
called cycles per second or Hertz which
means<00:02:56.120> if<00:02:56.510> we<00:02:56.659> have<00:02:56.870> 1<00:02:57.290> million<00:02:57.709> cycles<00:02:57.920> per

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
means if we have 1 million cycles per

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.449 
means if we have 1 million cycles per
second<00:02:58.790> that's<00:02:59.090> 1<00:02:59.359> megahertz<00:02:59.959> if<00:03:00.440> we<00:03:00.920> have<00:03:01.190> a

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
second that's 1 megahertz if we have a

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.780 
second that's 1 megahertz if we have a
thousand<00:03:02.359> megahertz<00:03:02.810> that's<00:03:03.079> 1<00:03:03.290> gigahertz<00:03:03.889> so

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
thousand megahertz that's 1 gigahertz so

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.280 
thousand megahertz that's 1 gigahertz so
whenever<00:03:05.180> we're<00:03:05.359> talking<00:03:05.720> about<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:06.079> Hertz

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
whenever we're talking about the Hertz

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.050 
whenever we're talking about the Hertz
the<00:03:06.500> higher<00:03:06.739> number<00:03:07.190> of<00:03:07.220> Hertz<00:03:07.489> then<00:03:07.760> a<00:03:07.879> higher

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
the higher number of Hertz then a higher

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.390 
the higher number of Hertz then a higher
number<00:03:08.359> of<00:03:08.510> cycles<00:03:09.079> per<00:03:09.139> second<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:10.099> more

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
number of cycles per second the more

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.849 
number of cycles per second the more
information<00:03:11.030> we<00:03:11.180> can<00:03:11.209> push<00:03:11.540> down<00:03:11.780> that<00:03:11.989> bus<00:03:12.260> so

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
information we can push down that bus so

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.410 
information we can push down that bus so
if<00:03:12.950> we<00:03:13.069> look<00:03:13.220> at<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.430> width<00:03:13.670> of<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.940> bus<00:03:14.120> and

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
if we look at the width of the bus and

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.780 
if we look at the width of the bus and
how<00:03:14.900> fast<00:03:15.290> it's<00:03:15.590> going<00:03:15.799> we're<00:03:16.400> gonna<00:03:16.489> come<00:03:16.760> up

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
how fast it's going we're gonna come up

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.240 
how fast it's going we're gonna come up
with<00:03:16.909> a<00:03:17.060> theoretical<00:03:17.900> throughput<00:03:18.319> of<00:03:18.709> just

with a theoretical throughput of just

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.710 
with a theoretical throughput of just
how<00:03:19.459> much<00:03:19.639> traffic<00:03:19.940> we're<00:03:20.299> able<00:03:20.389> to<00:03:20.569> get

how much traffic we're able to get

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.780 
how much traffic we're able to get
through<00:03:21.019> that<00:03:21.049> that<00:03:21.500> system<00:03:22.040> every<00:03:22.340> second<00:03:22.699> or

the<00:03:29.269> faster<00:03:29.780> your<00:03:29.900> system<00:03:30.260> is<00:03:30.349> going<00:03:30.530> to<00:03:30.620> be

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
the faster your system is going to be

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.319 
the faster your system is going to be
and<00:03:31.190> that's<00:03:31.340> why<00:03:31.489> whenever<00:03:31.730> we<00:03:32.030> look<00:03:32.180> at

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.180 
and that's why whenever we look at

time if we wanted to double the speed we

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.830 
time if we wanted to double the speed we
found<00:04:37.650> we<00:04:37.950> were<00:04:37.980> using<00:04:38.400> a<00:04:38.490> 16<00:04:39.030> bit<00:04:39.210> expansion

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
found we were using a 16 bit expansion

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.750 
found we were using a 16 bit expansion
slot<00:04:40.110> you'll<00:04:40.680> find<00:04:40.950> you<00:04:41.070> can<00:04:41.190> move<00:04:41.340> more

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.450 
expansion slots and this controller hub
on<00:04:45.930> the<00:04:45.960> other<00:04:46.170> side<00:04:46.500> so<00:04:47.010> you've<00:04:47.130> got<00:04:47.250> better

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
on the other side so you've got better

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.070 
on the other side so you've got better
throughput<00:04:47.820> you<00:04:48.030> got<00:04:48.300> faster<00:04:48.810> throughput

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
throughput you got faster throughput

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.080 
throughput you got faster throughput
usually<00:04:49.650> it's<00:04:50.010> a<00:04:50.100> lot<00:04:50.340> more<00:04:50.520> you<00:04:50.670> can<00:04:50.820> send

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
usually it's a lot more you can send

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.030 
usually it's a lot more you can send
across<00:04:51.360> that<00:04:51.570> twice<00:04:51.870> as<00:04:52.080> much<00:04:52.290> than<00:04:52.770> if<00:04:52.890> you

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
across that twice as much than if you

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.890 
across that twice as much than if you
were<00:04:53.160> using<00:04:53.400> an<00:04:53.640> 8-bit<00:04:54.180> device<00:04:54.510> and<00:04:54.780> that's

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
great throughput there but that's what

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.480 
great throughput there but that's what
we<00:05:53.700> had<00:05:53.940> on<00:05:53.970> the<00:05:54.120> original<00:05:54.600> IBM<00:05:54.810> PC<00:05:55.190> the<00:05:56.190> next

we had on the original IBM PC the next

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.640 
we had on the original IBM PC the next
computer<00:05:57.120> that<00:05:57.240> came<00:05:57.390> out<00:05:57.540> was<00:05:57.660> the<00:05:57.780> IBM<00:05:57.870> PC<00:05:58.410> 80

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
computer that came out was the IBM PC 80

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.760 
computer that came out was the IBM PC 80
the<00:05:59.430> bus<00:05:59.670> was<00:05:59.940> twice<00:06:00.240> as<00:06:00.450> big<00:06:00.660> it<00:06:00.840> was<00:06:00.930> 16<00:06:01.500> bits

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
the bus was twice as big it was 16 bits

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.250 
the bus was twice as big it was 16 bits
wide<00:06:02.030> still<00:06:03.030> ran<00:06:03.180> at<00:06:03.300> 7<00:06:03.570> megahertz<00:06:04.020> which

wide still ran at 7 megahertz which

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.930 
wide still ran at 7 megahertz which
means<00:06:04.500> we<00:06:04.710> were<00:06:04.830> able<00:06:04.950> to<00:06:05.100> essentially<00:06:05.550> double

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
means we were able to essentially double

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.970 
means we were able to essentially double
the<00:06:06.060> amount<00:06:06.270> of<00:06:06.330> theoretical<00:06:06.930> throughput<00:06:07.110> so

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:07.980 
the amount of theoretical throughput so

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.980 
the amount of theoretical throughput so
now<00:06:08.100> you're<00:06:08.250> starting<00:06:08.610> to<00:06:08.730> see<00:06:08.970> how<00:06:09.210> the<00:06:09.690> width

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
now you're starting to see how the width

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.810 
now you're starting to see how the width

really<00:06:12.360> have<00:06:12.540> an<00:06:12.690> impact<00:06:12.840> on<00:06:13.230> just<00:06:13.530> how<00:06:13.680> much

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
really have an impact on just how much

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 
the same time you really don't see that

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.600 
the same time you really don't see that
much<00:06:39.330> anymore<00:06:39.390> but<00:06:40.170> if<00:06:40.260> you're

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610 
much anymore but if you're

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.179 
much anymore but if you're
a<00:06:40.639> smaller<00:06:41.389> and<00:06:41.659> older<00:06:41.780> computer<00:06:42.409> that<00:06:42.680> is<00:06:43.159> a

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:44.930 
legacy system you'll see these these

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.179 
legacy system you'll see these these

interfaces inside of it and in some
cases<00:06:48.650> you<00:06:48.919> can<00:06:48.949> use<00:06:49.250> all<00:06:49.520> of<00:06:49.669> them<00:06:49.819> you<00:06:50.270> can

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449 
cases you can use all of them you can

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:52.209 
cases you can use all of them you can
use<00:06:50.629> only<00:06:50.960> one<00:06:51.169> type<00:06:51.409> at<00:06:51.590> a<00:06:51.650> time<00:06:51.860> it<00:06:51.979> depends

00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:52.219 
use only one type at a time it depends

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:54.820 
use only one type at a time it depends
on<00:06:52.310> the<00:06:52.400> motherboard<00:06:52.849> manufacturer<00:06:53.590> to<00:06:54.590> use

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:54.830 
on the motherboard manufacturer to use

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.339 
on the motherboard manufacturer to use
the<00:06:55.069> bus<00:06:55.250> you<00:06:55.879> had<00:06:56.000> a<00:06:56.030> 16-bit<00:06:56.719> device<00:06:57.080> this<00:06:57.289> is

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:57.349 
the bus you had a 16-bit device this is

00:06:57.349 --> 00:06:59.649 
the bus you had a 16-bit device this is
a<00:06:57.590> 16-bit<00:06:58.280> interface<00:06:58.879> card<00:06:59.240> that<00:06:59.449> was<00:06:59.539> an

00:06:59.649 --> 00:06:59.659 
a 16-bit interface card that was an

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:02.200 
a 16-bit interface card that was an
Ethernet<00:07:00.139> card<00:07:00.439> you<00:07:01.039> would<00:07:01.129> simply<00:07:01.370> slide<00:07:01.969> the

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.210 
Ethernet card you would simply slide the

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:03.339 
Ethernet card you would simply slide the
interface<00:07:02.569> in<00:07:02.750> there<00:07:02.840> notice<00:07:03.020> there's<00:07:03.259> a

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:03.349 
interface in there notice there's a

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:05.110 
interface in there notice there's a
notch<00:07:03.620> there<00:07:03.949> so<00:07:04.340> you<00:07:04.400> can't<00:07:04.610> put<00:07:04.789> it<00:07:04.879> in<00:07:05.000> the

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120 
notch there so you can't put it in the

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.360 
notch there so you can't put it in the
wrong<00:07:05.300> way<00:07:05.330> that<00:07:06.169> knotch<00:07:06.500> designates<00:07:07.129> and

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:07.370 
wrong way that knotch designates and

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:08.890 
wrong way that knotch designates and
tells<00:07:07.849> you<00:07:07.969> exactly<00:07:08.120> the<00:07:08.509> way<00:07:08.599> this

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:08.900 
tells you exactly the way this

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.330 
tells you exactly the way this
particular<00:07:09.319> card<00:07:09.590> would<00:07:09.770> have<00:07:09.860> fit<00:07:10.009> in<00:07:10.039> there

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:10.340 
particular card would have fit in there

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.610 
particular card would have fit in there
you<00:07:10.789> simply<00:07:11.180> position<00:07:11.689> it<00:07:11.930> correctly<00:07:12.289> in<00:07:12.469> the

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:12.620 
you simply position it correctly in the

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.709 
you simply position it correctly in the
slot<00:07:12.830> and<00:07:13.069> you<00:07:13.159> push<00:07:13.370> down<00:07:13.400> and<00:07:13.879> now<00:07:14.419> your

00:07:14.709 --> 00:07:14.719 
slot and you push down and now your

00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:16.809 
slot and you push down and now your
network<00:07:15.289> interface<00:07:15.830> card<00:07:16.129> is<00:07:16.219> installed<00:07:16.669> so
