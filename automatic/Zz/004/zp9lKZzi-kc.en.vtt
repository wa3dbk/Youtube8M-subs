thermoplastic<00:00:35.550> made<00:00:35.880> from<00:00:36.090> renewable<00:00:36.210> and

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
thermoplastic made from renewable and

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.900 
thermoplastic made from renewable and
natural<00:00:37.260> materials<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:38.280> basically<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.879> just

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
natural materials so basically it just

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.700 
natural materials so basically it just
sticks<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.420> itself<00:00:39.690> when<00:00:39.930> it's<00:00:40.050> heated<00:00:40.320> up<00:00:40.440> and

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
sticks to itself when it's heated up and

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.470 
sticks to itself when it's heated up and
can<00:00:41.129> move<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.430> into<00:00:41.640> any<00:00:41.790> shape<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.090> want<00:00:42.120> and

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
can move it into any shape you want and

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.430 
can move it into any shape you want and
once<00:00:42.690> it's<00:00:42.840> cool<00:00:43.020> off

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
once it's cool off

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.069 
once it's cool off
it's<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.309> shape<00:00:44.489> stays<00:00:44.809> you<00:00:45.809> can<00:00:45.960> purchase

yes<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.280> we're<00:00:56.430> actually<00:00:56.550> using<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:57.329> pattern

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
yes so we're actually using a pattern

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.590 
yes so we're actually using a pattern

and it's super helpful

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.850 
and it's super helpful
basically<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:03.000> print<00:01:03.359> out<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.750> shape<00:01:04.619> like

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
basically you print out a shape like

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.530 
basically you print out a shape like
this<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.189> suppression<00:01:05.430> guard<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.420> get

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
this the suppression guard and you get

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.210 
this the suppression guard and you get
to<00:01:06.720> draw<00:01:06.990> on<00:01:07.170> however<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.619> want<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.920> armor<00:01:08.189> to

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
to draw on however you want the armor to

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.250

look<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.729> for<00:01:09.090> Bellona<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.659> actually<00:01:09.810> wanted<00:01:10.140> to

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
look so for Bellona I actually wanted to

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.960 
look so for Bellona I actually wanted to
exaggerate<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.890> because<00:01:11.189> her<00:01:11.369> armor<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.820> like

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
exaggerate it because her armor is like

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.390 
exaggerate it because her armor is like
really<00:01:12.150> wide<00:01:12.530> so<00:01:13.530> you're<00:01:13.650> gonna<00:01:13.740> use<00:01:13.799> this<00:01:14.130> and

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
really wide so you're gonna use this and

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.249 
really wide so you're gonna use this and
you<00:01:14.490> just<00:01:14.610> have<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.790> make<00:01:14.909> sure<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.689> keep

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
you just have to make sure that you keep

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.039 
you just have to make sure that you keep
track<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.560> what<00:01:16.860> leg<00:01:17.040> it's<00:01:17.220> for<00:01:17.400> yes<00:01:18.330> alright

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
track of what leg it's for yes alright

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.440 
track of what leg it's for yes alright
and<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.320> next<00:01:19.590> step<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.280> want<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.790> trace

and the next step is you want to trace

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.840 
and the next step is you want to trace
your<00:01:21.810> pattern<00:01:21.869> slash<00:01:22.770> template<00:01:23.189> into<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.640> craft

it turns out clear and it makes the

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.120 
it turns out clear and it makes the
armor<00:02:59.599> not<00:02:59.780> absorbent<00:03:00.319> it<00:03:00.440> kind<00:03:00.590> of<00:03:00.620> seals<00:03:00.860> it

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
armor not absorbent it kind of seals it
