00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.049
 make this video possible 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.049
 by microsoft mobile devices 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.679
 one of the new devices here on it 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.139
 rico's mobile world congress is this 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.369
 already week highway star 4g and he again 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.529
 stick none between all that themselves 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.210
 focus primarily on design in this and sun go 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.460
 I'll tell you more about it 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.900
 the stasi gm quiet so especially on design 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.939
 is also nicely designed as far as I am concerned 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.800
 it is very thin 6.6 mm 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.599
 has a metal back and he are 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.160
 different colors this color flower 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.450
 that is the color of wiko 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.880
 the old behind me means a lot 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.219
 he is also in silver 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.780
 the dark and the gold thus 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.340
 totally metal back and it feels 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.350
 all quite high quality and it 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.149
 also looks nice that we stand out 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.190
 is that the finish that is top here 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.020
 See the top like we just 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.440
 a little gap is that kind 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.840
 thingies 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.059
 where good yes all in all it is 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.579
 design is just very beautiful I think 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.050
 the phone does not have it 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.520
 interchangeable battery but 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.980
 extendable memory 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.820
 nsm deals in functionality in one of 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.949
 the two 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.260
 You should choose locks if you have a nano 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.850
 sim or a micro sd 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.590
 But the times is just it's choosing 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.110
 that so nicely taken 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.250
 the phone has on to the yes 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.750
 front another kind of plastic 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.340
 lie on top 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.259
 it looks a little strange, I look 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.630
 but saying there is little wrong with that 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.070
 Phone has a 5 inch HD amoled 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.140
 screen and it looks nice 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.090
 colors are very lively the contrast 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.280
 is super high of course the viewing angle of 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.990
 the screen is good and with the only thing 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.640
 perhaps on the screen 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.619
 is that he is not extremely sharp and that 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.150
 the brightness is also not super high 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.259
 but it all just seems spacious 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.280
 sufficient to be so at first 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.540
 face 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.130
 the phone runs on one 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.439
 mediatek processor that are octa core 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.960
 processor bare panda luffy gert 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.970
 so the signal 53 cores is 64-bit short 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.530
 processor and unfortunately that does not shine 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.090
 android lollipop your side can't be there yet 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.530
 make full use of it 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.450
 wiko says he's going for an update 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.100
 get to android lollipop 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.450
 so that does n't just promise what the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.159
 phone turns on it's not really though 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.049
 just fast and that is actually very bad 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.299
 little to criticize has 2 gigabytes 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.369
 main memory 16 gigabytes of internal memory 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.069
 and he has his own skin from week already 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.470
 got it and that peel it 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.400
 yes in itself is not ugly I think the 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.689
 his icons 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.569
 they are a bit colorful around me 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:17.430
 flat it looks nice in itself 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.260
 yes i just had stock android 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.760
 What better only found this to me 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.560
 is also good to do in itself 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.180
 interface is also very close 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.610
 stayed with stock android if you go for it 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.019
 it is here that way unfolds then see 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.480
 you just think it's all standard 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.349
 the phone has a 13 megapixel 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.390
 camera on the back 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.489
 5 megapixel camera in the front and 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.019
 that camera also has a lot of selfie 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.700
 flash are nice even in the dark 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.049
 make selfies with the phone 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.310
 well a camera quality dare not yet 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.680
 so very much to say here on the 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.209
 stock market but at least the 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.769
 specifications are order and I think it is 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.470
 nice that he also has a selfie flash 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.150
 all in all this week is oh star 4g and 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.560
 name interesting device that the especially 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.750
 looks very nice 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.189
 He will be in April on April 20 at exactly 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.409
 to be on the market also come in 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.870
 the netherlands via other coolblue 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.549
 phone on yes that goes around 300 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.230
 euro costs so it is exactly want that can 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.500
 don't say yet or kat nico not yet 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.909
 but good for that money 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.159
 yes it is above all a nice phone 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.750
 the question of whether that specification area 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.290
 can come along well with the rest 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.609
 from the market 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.290
 but at first glance it looks up 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.780
 so good for that there is 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.910
 nice has nice specifications 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.859
 runs nice and smooth and also has 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.859
 a nice selfie flash as an extra
