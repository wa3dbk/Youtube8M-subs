00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
control the angle and that's just to

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.609 
control the angle and that's just to
raise<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.800> lower<00:00:16.830> um<00:00:18.320> yeah

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619

here you got your track tensioner you

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.710 
here you got your track tensioner you
got<00:00:25.230> your<00:00:25.580> drivetrain<00:00:28.910> you<00:00:29.910> got<00:00:30.060> really<00:00:30.390> big

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
got your drivetrain you got really big

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.830 
got your drivetrain you got really big
blade<00:00:31.019> up<00:00:31.170> here<00:00:31.910> with<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.090> guard<00:00:33.510> up<00:00:33.660> front

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
blade up here with the guard up front

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.840 
blade up here with the guard up front
not<00:00:34.020> quite<00:00:34.350> sure<00:00:34.380> what<00:00:34.680> it'd<00:00:34.770> be<00:00:34.860> use<00:00:35.010> for<00:00:35.309> like

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
not quite sure what it'd be use for like

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.280 
not quite sure what it'd be use for like
you<00:00:35.969> got<00:00:36.090> your<00:00:36.180> lift<00:00:36.360> cylinders<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:36.960> think<00:00:37.170> this

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
you got your lift cylinders I think this

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.639 
you got your lift cylinders I think this
is<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.440> alway<00:00:38.250> blade<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:39.050> want<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.110> say<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.530> can

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
is a alway blade I want to say so it can

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.709 
is a alway blade I want to say so it can
tilt<00:00:40.890> like<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.670> up<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.149> down<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.510> think

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
tilt like this and up and down I think

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.860 
tilt like this and up and down I think
um<00:00:43.730> I'll<00:00:44.730> show<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.030> up<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.329> cab<00:00:45.510> here<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:45.809> a

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
um I'll show you up in the cab here in a

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:56.299 
um I'll show you up in the cab here in a
second<00:00:53.780> it<00:00:54.780> looks<00:00:55.050> like<00:00:55.140> it's<00:00:55.320> got<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.469> fire

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
second it looks like it's got a fire

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.889 
second it looks like it's got a fire
suppression<00:00:56.910> system<00:00:57.270> on<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.539> or<00:00:57.629> something

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
suppression system on it or something

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.000 
suppression system on it or something
it's<00:00:58.469> different

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
it's different

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:08.210 
it's different
um<00:00:59.840> but<00:01:00.840> yeah<00:01:03.830> basic<00:01:04.830> d8<00:01:05.129> really<00:01:05.519> um<00:01:06.770> the<00:01:07.770> d9<00:01:08.070> I

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
um but yeah basic d8 really um the d9 I

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.800 
um but yeah basic d8 really um the d9 I
showed<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.580> before<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:09.180> might<00:01:09.659> not<00:01:09.780> have

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
showed you before I might not have

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.539 
showed you before I might not have
uploaded<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.380> yet<00:01:10.560> but<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.799> will<00:01:11.340> if<00:01:11.460> I

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
uploaded that yet but I will if I

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.070 
uploaded that yet but I will if I
haven't<00:01:11.729> um<00:01:13.850> that<00:01:14.850> there<00:01:15.210> when<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.720> take<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> look

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
haven't um that there when I take a look

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.470 
haven't um that there when I take a look
up<00:01:16.320> here<00:01:16.350> for<00:01:16.560> ya

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.480 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.480 

a<00:01:20.910> home<00:01:21.910> basic<00:01:22.630> cab<00:01:23.100> outside<00:01:24.100> looks<00:01:24.280> a<00:01:24.340> lot

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
a home basic cab outside looks a lot

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.950 
a home basic cab outside looks a lot
better<00:01:24.610> than<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:24.940> inside<00:01:25.180> does<00:01:25.420> but<00:01:25.660> my<00:01:25.780> guess

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
better than the inside does but my guess

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.560 
better than the inside does but my guess
is<00:01:25.990> it<00:01:26.200> went<00:01:26.350> through<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:26.530> paint<00:01:26.710> shop<00:01:26.890> um

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
is it went through the paint shop um

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.910 
is it went through the paint shop um
yeah<00:01:28.570> this<00:01:28.750> has<00:01:28.930> a<00:01:28.960> fire<00:01:29.140> suppression<00:01:29.650> system

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
yeah this has a fire suppression system

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.780 
yeah this has a fire suppression system
it<00:01:30.040> that's<00:01:30.190> kind<00:01:30.370> of<00:01:30.400> cool

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
it that's kind of cool

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.520

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
there's your running controls your

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.900 
there's your running controls your
Ripper<00:01:38.710> controls<00:01:39.130> over<00:01:39.370> there<00:01:41.430> yeah<00:01:42.430> not

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
Ripper controls over there yeah not

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.930 
Ripper controls over there yeah not
quite<00:01:43.180> sure<00:01:43.270> where<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.660> blade<00:01:43.900> controls<00:01:44.290> are

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
quite sure where the blade controls are

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.460 
quite sure where the blade controls are
regardless<00:01:45.940> these<00:01:46.210> probably<00:01:46.750> also<00:01:46.990> function

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
regardless these probably also function

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.940 
regardless these probably also function
as<00:01:47.590> driving<00:01:48.130> and<00:01:48.430> blade<00:01:48.940> controls<00:01:49.360> so<00:01:50.290> there

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
as driving and blade controls so there

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.310 
as driving and blade controls so there
you<00:01:51.070> go<00:01:51.160> that<00:01:51.370> is<00:01:51.400> a<00:01:52.110> d8<00:01:53.110> for<00:01:53.380> you<00:01:55.260> thanks<00:01:56.260> for
