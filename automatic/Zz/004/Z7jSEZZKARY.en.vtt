 brand sign bright red weight 10 5 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:25.310
 tons of 280 ps special feature more mobile 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:27.689
 body up to six meters 20 height 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.669
 usually enter and leave the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.829
 passengers at Frankfurt airport the 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:34.260
 plane over the passenger bridge or 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.210
 the stairs can be some passengers 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.489
 only to be transported horizontally 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.870
 for example, when on an adventure holiday 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.090
 accident happened 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.430
 for these so-called stretcher 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.520
 There are transports at the airport 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.000
 special ambulance our ambulance 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.190
 lift pallet truck has the task that he has on 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.500
 We can drive six meters in height 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.150
 get patients out of the planes 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.590
 You can walk without the outside stairs 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.120
 that means in wind and weather 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.500
 we can actually protect the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.899
 Get the patient out of the plane 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.000
 the medical equipment is the 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.149
 same as in any other 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.610
 ambulance 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:10.619
 so you can find here next to ekg and 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.360
 Oxygen cylinder on a hydraulic 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.670
 adjustable drage table the the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.000
 patients barely feel the blowholes 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.369
 leaves 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.289
 the rescue service has to move out here 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.710
 for the same reasons as in the 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:21.539
 city 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.249
 we have traffic accidents here 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.840
 work accidents heart attack everything 

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:25.649
 heard and occasionally come 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.439
 again children in the world 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:31.170
 But that was the last time two years ago 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.729
 in the cabinets of the vehicle is under 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.420
 an emergency case 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.499
 respirator respirators as well 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.810
 firefighter helmets for self-protection of 

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:42.509
 staff available at all times 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.429
 also the retractable apothecary cabinet 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.039
 with a squirt union agents and 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.929
 Infusions are already special 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.469
 important for the transport of the injured 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.999
 Travelers, however, is another device 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:55.380
 In this cabinet we have ours 

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:57.869
 wear so-called shovel 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.819
 These are special I wear in two 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.229
 Join parts under the patient 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:01.859
 This is not what the patient needs to do 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.329
 move 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:04.859
 in case of spinal injuries or 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.209
 Pelvic injuries can be so patient 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:08.099
 how he lies and I lie down 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.569
 move with simple paddles 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.540
 That's why the question is under the 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.730
 Patients and that will be needed right away 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.670
 because a lying patient has to vom 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.970
 fliers from rome 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.470
 be transported to their onward flight 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.510
 various technical refinements of the 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.090
 Vehicles make a smooth run 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.950
 use possible above the cab 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.930
 lies the so-called handover platform 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.790
 This handover platform is compulsory 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.380
 guided in two rails on the trunk 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.180
 is automatically taken up 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.370
 as soon as the luggage compartment goes up 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.390
 and come across this handover platform 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.340
 Then we get into the planes 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.810
 we had to cut the roof off 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.910
 let this vehicle with us 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.709
 a minimum transfer of two meters 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.450
 can keep forty because that will 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.500
 needed for the boeing 737 that is 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.350
 our smallest machine we 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.720
 can serve because the platform of 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.730
 driver's seat is out of sight there 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.260
 it under the windshield a little 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.850
 helper 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.720
 This camera allows me to dock 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.090
 on plane 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.580
 It shows directly upwards directly at the 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.989
 handover platform over so i see 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.430
 on my screen always exactly how 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.980
 far away from the airplane I'm still around 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.480
 damage the plane up to 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.090
 prevents scratches and bumps 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.549
 automatically a force limiter in the rubber 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.680
 the already low pressure of 30 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.510
 kilo against the flier breaks off immediately 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.060
 if the platform of the machine is too close 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.250
 comes further down the vehicle worries 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.590
 also for extendable supports for 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.820
 a safe stand 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.620
 so he started up the stable again 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.989
 he has support propped up 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.489
 Be four pieces then the suspension 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.400
 the vehicle is no longer active then 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:39.190
 he can not tip over up to 45 knots 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.040
 wind can endure the case structure so 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.030
 for today's stretcher patient goes 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.609
 it after the pass and 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.959
 Security check directly to 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:50.440
 the maximum achievable 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.920
 height of the trunk structure of 620 is enough 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.320
 by the way, around the lower level of the 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.840
 a380 or the boeing 747 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.910
 but also who wants to stay in frankfurt 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.920
 can be transported by lift truck 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.790
 because the vehicle has also behind 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.000
 an exit 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.709
 this is the hero lift used around 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.090
 the patient in the vehicle or out of the 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.489
 bring the vehicle around the 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.280
 height difference between interior and 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.739
 balance ground 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:21.600
 For a gentle journey is at the airport 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.600
 So taken care of for all passengers
