00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.660
 me 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.640
 I was really looking forward to my first world tournament and the team 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.140
 Of course, with the aim winning as a 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:42.300
 I entered the tournament with that kind of goal 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:47.070
 Well, first of all the goal is to go through the group league firmly 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.140
 There are Well favor th against England among them ended up in that not a little to take the results 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.670
 I also had to say 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.130
 Well that while learning from such a defeat 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.540
 make up 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:04.030
 I think that I went to the tournament and especially that one 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:11.049
 Well I have not come out myself, but in that German game 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:13.880
 I felt really strong as a team since I dropped home from Germany 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:17.240
 I think it is not 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:23.229
 By the way Germany was not in- house 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.229
 If you look at the friends who are fighting well 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.760
 I'm not sure I'm going to lose anything more than being confident I can win 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.440
 I just run my body 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.710
 Fighting 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.020
 I can say I can win if I can 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:42.200
 Somehow the number of houses itself is very 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:46.880
 Because there was such 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:50.899
 Out of it I felt also the I mean Tsu Na'm World Cup 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:57.829
 Because I had the feeling that I would do it rather than imagine 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:02:02.030
 But that to I did not have the opportunity to easily come out from the start but still this 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.960
 Of course I stand on the pitch I understand that 11 players are great players 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.870
 Yes 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:11.280
 But even if the chance comes by all means that the tiger sees that 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:17.640
 Because I was aiming for something like that 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:19.610
 I got a chance in the semi-finals and I was able to finish running well there 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.380
 Good for me 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.380
 I think it might have appealed 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.900
 Are you through the tournament? 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.900
 After all of the finals 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.000
 The final match is all but now it is the goal of the player 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.870
 The 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.349
 It is the moment that was decided 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:45.480
 Marking confetti dances and there is no problem 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.480
 I think that it is not forgotten stones scene 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:58.490
 You're Well, I think that that day ten football Do hope you me this became a major 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:03:01.520
 Because there was also, you have to choose from various media and such exposure increases 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:05.520
 I was very happy to say that 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:11.010
 It's not that I 've been playing soccer for some reason 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:14.250
 It is that oneself that the degree of attention from the surroundings has risen in this way along with that firm result 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:19.200
 It was a great pleasure for me too 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.790
 Well just that of course Tteyuu I imagine more than I had thought it good if that happened is 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.950
 Of course there was 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:27.220
 But that totally 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:32.010
 Especially because I did not imagine it 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.010
 It was not the Tteyuu Toka or there is confusion 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:48.600
 Well you see, it is not that oneself, but the country of the other country is the champion 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:53.040
 That best to Tteyuu come to look at the wind eyes that and say, 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:57.000
 I think it is another part I think it is a part of ci hardship 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.359
 Maa 2011 World Cup Winner 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.719
 There was a gold medal at that olympic 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:06.989
 Well but still to read the world's mighty 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:12.359
 I think Japan still lacks power 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:13.030
 However, we challenge ourselves firmly as challenger and do what we want to do 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.560
 Firmly 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:22.090
 In the world 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:24.550
 So that I mean how there firmly Yareru because I think win not it is that there is no 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.250
 I wonder what 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:32.440
 By 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:34.770
 I will aim to win the tournament more than I really do 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.770
 Take 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:45.260
 I see. 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:47.910
 I had a dream of becoming a soccer player when I started playing soccer 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:53.460
 Line like in old days 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:56.280
 Te dream to say Na want out I wonder whether the World Cup and the Olympic want to enter the Japan representative 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:05:00.840
 Come before the other now school day rather than 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:04.980
 It is the World Cup if it is this time and the Olympics if it will be next year, so that is close 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:07.070
 It is that world meeting as a goal in the place 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.340
 Of course representative 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.340
 so 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.160
 no I want to stay a member 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.160
 I have a dream 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:22.220
 There were a lot of things like that 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:27.360
 It seems childish Ensei is Toka anything ya-san vague is 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:30.230
 At that time, I was 7 niece, but cavit tendant would be better 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:34.289
 I think I had such a dream 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:40.189
 I also had a dream that I wanted to be a ranch daughter 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:40.189
 I think it is still a bit realistic 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:59.670
 I think that it is the goodness of Nadeshiko Japan that the nature and smile come out even if I am not conscious 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:04.500
 When the say so but are there do a lot of Tteyuu time course painful 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:07.790
 I think that there is also a smile just because you get over 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:11.230
 To be able to put out such a little more 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.230
 I think I want to do my best again 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:21.780
 Well still I can not say soccer by myself 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:27.330
 Of course, I had the other party is have a companion to many people ask them support towards the various staff 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:28.860
 Yourself ask them to support that shall be on have always Rutteyuu thank upright on the pitch 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:32.770
 I think 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:34.760
 Well still Zu' a particularly painful era 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:38.409
 When 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:43.520
 I say seniors who were able to support me this way 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:49.490
 I feel great thanks to my seniors 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:50.569
 Well, let's show your own play, and in such a good player you can tell something like this 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:55.580
 Not 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:58.320
 Still , there are people who support me because it is my support 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.280
 Such people 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.810
 A look at his play 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:05.630
 Saying that I got the courage I got 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:07.280
 So get 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.389
 truly 

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.389
 Well not outside 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:17.970
 Also I think that want to play, such as get to thought that want to support more and more
