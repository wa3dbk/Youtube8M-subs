00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.190
 how to get a horse 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.520
 christina have you ever wanted a 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.520
 horse 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:15.850
 Well, I'll show you how to get it 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:18.220
 a plan the wave I saw the driver in and 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:22.000
 I come to tell you how to get a 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:27.490
 horse or the first way as he said 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.890
 cristina then buying it but I am 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:33.879
 a cheapskate not the only thing that makes 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.140
 is to spend your money on buying spells 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.510
 that never 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:42.280
 I will never use 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:44.739
 today no red thing that moves 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:49.000
 thus giving circulation is safe to eat 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:51.670
 It will serve a lot but good if I do not know how 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.589
 I am a millionaire and want to 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.269
 buy a horse and help the 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:58.930
 community that has more horses can 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:01.370
 harvard PromodÃ©s talk to your talk is 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.330
 talk to him he will say 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.840
 can i buy a field 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.770
 and I suppose if you have clear money is 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:16.259
 and will tell you my offer in my gold and how 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.259
 I no longer form 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.650
 well the second way to get a 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.440
 horse is stealing the same man that 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.920
 you have seen here the school I do not know what 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.710
 well then or here your horse very nice 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.700
 if you see that when you give it to him 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.610
 red but take care of the consequences if 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.440
 take and if they would give him there and you steal everything 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.350
 the town has come for us although 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.570
 he has done my missions and there is help 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.550
 in your economy and you have to save the 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.080
 picture village my work is going to me 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.700
 come for you you used to see us 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.770
 dead and in prison they are not going to stop 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.770
 but I do not care 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.090
 do not 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.690
 third way find 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.620
 que 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.380
 well the last and proper form and 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.660
 that normally when going through the field 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.660
 you can find that passersby 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.000
 moves and 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.650
 and they leave their horses there to freedom 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.260
 from the man to hong kong who is 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.020
 over there flying they are eaten so 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.790
 This is the easiest way or lose 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.520
 money or that nobody tried you 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.470
 they killed and put the jail to find it 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.470
 and now you have it forever 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.160
 the conclusion I will never play to the 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.160
 Street 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.280
 schalke 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.610
 because in the good of the cane they can 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.610
 buy the chicken 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:50.739
 and it's called enrique there are they do successfully 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:57.220
 there are some horses that run and put as 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:57.220
 run because if you will not find me
