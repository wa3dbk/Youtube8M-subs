00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.639
 he greets bernd schips I think the 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.839
 time has come to make us a little 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.940
 update about the 24 so that 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.830
 has happened since the last 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.750
 news first the rearview mirror 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:28.250
 so this in news about that but you 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:32.450
 see it like that we believe dimension 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:36.420
 so this room is homemade 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:40.250
 the rod and the support also I had 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.250
 just would this base of retro the 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:52.610
 saone is very important and then two 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.760
 three little things about the engine 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:59.070
 firstly I broke this piece in 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.289
 the way of rods with springs that 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.539
 allow to dampen the brewer's 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.070
 motor I'm going to break I think I've 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.049
 notice attention the chain it had to 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.640
 stall the engine and I did not have to 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.650
 realize that his strength and and crac 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.479
 what comfort I swear to make people 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.549
 when the base I have to make a 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:20.689
 steel rod underneath what else 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:24.150
 good juice motor surely not much 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:27.390
 I participated in the crossing of 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.960
 bordeaux which from a kind of rally to 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.310
 through the Bordeaux is in the day 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.939
 I made 155 km with this little beast 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.040
 which worked very well 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.720
 155 km that's a lot 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.250
 so I was a little scared that he was super 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.229
 well done 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.520
 only one small point that I had was 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.350
 that this piece here it is that is the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.500
 output of the coil for the wire of 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.880
 candle broke off at the best of the road the 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.110
 road I came by nature the fox or 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.000
 so I used a piece of wire from 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.759
 iron is what I said iron wire 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.840
 to hold her up her outfit 90 km 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:10.379
 so it's not bad since since 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.420
 a week I did a little over 250 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:16.500
 kilometers there is 160 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.290
 100 km in total he took ribs 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.790
 monstrous where I had to pedal he did 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.380
 monstrous descent where the meter 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.840
 the referee has passed beyond 60 and has 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.020
 continued true so far until the 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.690
 vertical very very very funny good by 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.130
 against it is a little dangerous anyway 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.920
 the rear brake that was not braking very 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.760
 well it's done they would do better but 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.550
 since I have the impression that it is 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.630
 really worn angry head sets the 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.040
 brake before the legs are dead 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.040
 so much so that they knew how to serve 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.660
 I work my bulb before I too 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.170
 think that is a little overcharged and 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.430
 especially big problem in the back 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.060
 vibrate a lot so here I did a 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:03.569
 reinforcement yesterday on the mudguard but we 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.540
 see here who split there too he 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.299
 split in the back I was bad 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.940
 turn fixed because in fact the bindings 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.640
 the aluminum stand out around and the 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:20.250
 hole grown what and so the sat is 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:22.769
 no more the engine the engine is going very 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.930
 Well, I had some oil problems 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.570
 who passed in the in the low engine 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.220
 the gearbox oil so I 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.790
 think I see this powerful are a 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.170
 little worn this fair I change them the 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.540
 light I did my first test of 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.829
 recharging batteries 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:43.530
 it worked very well no problem 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.920
 overall it works well we walk 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.579
 very well 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.190
 I live bravo 4 the clutch that 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.680
 skated a little at the beginning it's complete 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:56.390
 that we do 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:04:01.730
 now he took it well here 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:03.500
 modo is now once he will 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.750
 to make sure ah yes something else very 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:12.650
 important 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:13.639
 I broke a ray that's bad I 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.829
 think he 's scared that I'm finding 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:18.410
 steel mudguard and maybe I 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:20.590
 refit the the shelving see as 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.690
 I exchanged funds from nice people 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.780
 sacred job in perspective 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.780
 here we are 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.390
 another important point 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:53.420
 I lost my life this derailleur from the 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.750
 throttle lever in a round 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.800
 point 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.510
 so I redid this system but I 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.030
 afraid of continuing to lose davis it's 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.780
 a little annoying especially its delights 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.780
