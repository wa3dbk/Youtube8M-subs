sharp<00:00:21.960> so<00:00:22.680> let's<00:00:23.010> start<00:00:23.279> with<00:00:23.490> G<00:00:24.199> which<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.410> not

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
sharp so let's start with G which is not

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.359 
sharp so let's start with G which is not
wrong<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.519> we<00:00:26.699> also<00:00:26.880> have<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.859> we<00:00:28.859> have<00:00:28.890> been

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.200 

so<00:01:04.610> we<00:01:04.820> use<00:01:05.060> a<00:01:05.330> minor<00:01:05.720> and<00:01:06.140> then<00:01:06.290> we<00:01:06.470> go<00:01:06.650> to<00:01:06.680> a

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
so we use a minor and then we go to a

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:16.570 
so we use a minor and then we go to a
minor<00:01:08.380> so<00:01:10.630> let's<00:01:11.630> use<00:01:12.430> Aeon<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:13.580> base<00:01:15.040> G<00:01:16.040> and<00:01:16.340> E

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
minor so let's use Aeon the base G and E

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.870 
minor so let's use Aeon the base G and E
on<00:01:16.820> the<00:01:16.940> right<00:01:17.090> hand

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880

impressed with each of the left hand so

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.670 
impressed with each of the left hand so
one<00:01:35.900> need<00:01:36.260> to<00:01:36.290> be<00:01:36.560> 3d<00:01:37.430> 40<00:01:38.180> and<00:01:38.690> now<00:01:39.320> we<00:01:39.380> do

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
one need to be 3d 40 and now we do

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.010 
one need to be 3d 40 and now we do
exactly<00:01:39.830> the<00:01:40.160> same<00:01:40.190> thing<00:01:40.610> in<00:01:40.790> a<00:01:41.060> minor<00:01:43.840> we<00:01:44.840> use

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020

with G on the base G B D on the right
let's<00:03:05.990> start<00:03:06.230> with<00:03:06.350> Basin<00:03:07.069> right<00:03:07.250> hand<00:03:08.380> 1g<00:03:09.380> 2g

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
let's start with Basin right hand 1g 2g

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.600 
let's start with Basin right hand 1g 2g
3G<00:03:10.880> 4G<00:03:11.360> so<00:03:12.350> we<00:03:12.770> move<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.010> right<00:03:13.310> hand<00:03:13.370> down<00:03:15.610> and

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
3G 4G so we move the right hand down and

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.840 
3G 4G so we move the right hand down and
then<00:03:16.760> we<00:03:16.880> go<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.060> a<00:03:17.390> minor<00:03:18.250> and<00:03:19.250> we<00:03:19.520> do<00:03:19.700> exactly

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
then we go to a minor and we do exactly

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.350 
then we go to a minor and we do exactly
the<00:03:20.390> same<00:03:20.420> thing<00:03:20.900> we<00:03:21.110> start<00:03:21.410> with<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.650> base<00:03:21.890> a

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
the same thing we start with the base a

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.250 
the same thing we start with the base a
and<00:03:23.360> G<00:03:23.780> seen<00:03:24.470> on<00:03:24.709> the<00:03:24.830> right<00:03:24.980> hand<00:03:25.630> come<00:03:26.630> on

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
and G seen on the right hand come on

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:38.020 
and G seen on the right hand come on
a<00:03:27.290> 2<00:03:28.069> a<00:03:28.370> 3<00:03:28.400> a<00:03:29.120> 4<00:03:29.150> K<00:03:30.250> G<00:03:31.250> a<00:03:35.320> so<00:03:36.320> this<00:03:37.190> is<00:03:37.340> the<00:03:37.519> end<00:03:37.730> of

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
a 2 a 3 a 4 K G a so this is the end of

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.380 
a 2 a 3 a 4 K G a so this is the end of
the<00:03:38.780> verse<00:03:39.080> and<00:03:39.410> now<00:03:40.100> we'll<00:03:40.310> go<00:03:40.459> to<00:03:40.489> the<00:03:40.670> chorus

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
the verse and now we'll go to the chorus

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.690 
the verse and now we'll go to the chorus
so<00:03:41.989> let's<00:03:42.319> play<00:03:42.440> one<00:03:42.590> more<00:03:42.650> time<00:03:42.800> the<00:03:43.130> best<00:03:43.400> and

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
so let's play one more time the best and

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.059 
so let's play one more time the best and
then<00:03:43.819> we<00:03:43.970> can<00:03:44.120> explain<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.660> chord<00:03:44.959> so<00:03:45.800> the

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
then we can explain the chord so the

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:52.360 
then we can explain the chord so the
verse<00:03:46.280> starts<00:03:46.519> like<00:03:46.880> the<00:03:47.569> introduction

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:04:02.949 

you

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.500 

and<00:04:03.530> now<00:04:03.620> we've<00:04:03.769> got<00:04:03.799> the<00:04:04.099> course<00:04:04.400> so<00:04:05.359> the

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
and now we've got the course so the

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.240 
and now we've got the course so the
first<00:04:05.750> part<00:04:06.049> of<00:04:06.109> the<00:04:06.230> course<00:04:06.439> C<00:04:06.980> major

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.760 

then<00:04:09.820> we<00:04:10.030> have<00:04:10.240> G<00:04:10.510> major<00:04:11.160> then<00:04:12.160> is<00:04:12.310> B<00:04:12.610> major<00:04:12.910> and

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
then we have G major then is B major and

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.970 
then we have G major then is B major and
then<00:04:14.770> is<00:04:15.100> email<00:04:15.700> so<00:04:16.660> let's<00:04:16.870> start<00:04:17.709> from<00:04:17.829> the

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
then is email so let's start from the

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.650 
then is email so let's start from the
first<00:04:18.010> part<00:04:18.519> would<00:04:18.609> you<00:04:18.670> C<00:04:18.970> major

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
first part would you C major

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.410 
first part would you C major
we<00:04:20.049> started<00:04:20.380> with<00:04:20.500> C<00:04:20.709> on<00:04:20.829> the<00:04:20.950> base<00:04:21.130> G<00:04:21.730> see<00:04:22.090> me

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
we started with C on the base G see me

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.620 
we started with C on the base G see me
on<00:04:22.660> the<00:04:22.690> right<00:04:22.930> hand<00:04:23.550> one<00:04:24.550> then<00:04:25.180> we<00:04:25.300> move<00:04:25.510> the

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
on the right hand one then we move the

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.060 
on the right hand one then we move the
right<00:04:25.720> hand<00:04:25.780> down<00:04:26.350> one<00:04:27.930> and<00:04:28.930> we<00:04:29.110> presently<00:04:29.620> see

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
right hand down one and we presently see

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.560 
right hand down one and we presently see
when<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:30.550> right<00:04:30.700> hands<00:04:31.000> up<00:04:31.300> so<00:04:31.660> 1<00:04:32.110> C<00:04:32.560> 2<00:04:32.590> C

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
when the right hands up so 1 C 2 C

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.570 
when the right hands up so 1 C 2 C
always<00:04:34.570> keep<00:04:34.840> pressing<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.320> base<00:04:35.530> but<00:04:36.340> once
