00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.570
 Welcome to this edition from October 13 to 15 due to concacaf signals 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.960
 today we will review the previous of the matches on Wednesday by the last 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.400
 2010 South Africa qualifying date will also see how it went at 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.430
 rich in the U-20 world in our window to the confederation 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.859
 to close with the question of the day 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:25.460
 and we begin by reviewing what the duels will be for the tenth and last date of 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.000
 World Cup qualifiers on Wednesday 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.590
 in a hexagonal that finally has two classified to the world 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.420
 united states that leads the group with 19 points 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.810
 and mexico that after being scared at the beginning of the process 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.010
 he secured his passage by being second with 18 units disputing the last pass 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.090
 straight to the World Cup joust is in costa rica that came back to the 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.019
 third position with 15 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.029
 and honduras that as things are at this moment would be playing the 

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:59.020
 repechaje with a conmebol team that could be uruguay 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.050
 ecuador coín trusa the same argentina 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.519
 completely eliminated are the savior and trinidad tobago 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.080
 and perhaps one of the main concacaf classics is that of Honduras 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.300
 and the savior 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.510
 this time it will be the cuscatlecos who will have the location in a meeting 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.210
 scheduled for 6 o'clock local time 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.060
 and although he is already out of the race 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.220
 the savior will not be easy prey for the Honduran Yankee wants to keep 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.340
 all its good performance at the cuscatlán stadium 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.789
 although they have only achieved one win and four losses in the last five 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:33.070
 dates of the hexagonal 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.110
 scoring only one goal in the last four 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.260
 in the history of the qualifiers the Salvadorans have won three and lost 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.200
 four of the confrontations against the catrachos playing at home but the 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.970
 coach Carlos de los Cobos will not be able to count this time with Mar Borque or 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:48.740
 henriquez 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.850
 nor with the author of the goal against mexico julio martínez 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.850
 both suspended by accumulation of cards 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.390
 in front you will be Honduras who will arrive with everything to try to secure your pass 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.210
 direct to the world although for this you need not only win this match 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.690
 but it depends on which costa rica loses or ties before the united states the 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.770
 same rival who gave his second consecutive loss to the catrachos the 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:13.930
 Last Saturday 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.719
 and this time playing at home 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:19.540
 and although the record as a visit in these qualifiers is not very good with only 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.489
 a victory in eight games the good news for the coach is that 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.680
 both dani turcios and beloved guevara will be available after fulfilling the 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.879
 suspension of a game by accumulation of yellow 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.900
 on the other hand the other contender to the last direct square to south africa coast 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.379
 rich should visit an already classified united states in their redoubt of the 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.189
 Freshly grapes, at 8 pm Eastern time 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:47.450
 although already thinking about what will be its sixth consecutive world championship 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:51.919
 by Bob Bradley they want to extend their winning streak to four and keep 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:54.459
 the paternity they have over the tricolor 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.770
 with five wins and a draw in seven games playing at home 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.090
 they will also have the extra motivation to avenge the defeat suffered by 1 to 3 against 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.279
 the ticos in the first leg 

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:10.499
 while Costa Rica comes with the spirit up after his new coach 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:12.790
 the Brazilian rené simoes 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.440
 I will bring victory under his arm 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.279
 but only a triumph helps him to qualify directly to South Africa 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:22.279
 in what would be his second world cup after Spain'82 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:27.409
 and they will also be fighting against history that says that in 24 years the 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:31.189
 tricolor has not been able to take a triumph playing for eliminatory in 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:32.650
 American terrain 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.960
 unable to score a single goal in the last four matches 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.620
 but at least for this duel the technician simoes will be able to count on 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.919
 full campus 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.510
 and closing the 2010 elimination process 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.870
 mexico already classified to its fifth consecutive world 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.840
 will visit the eliminated trinidad tobago in a match that will also start 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.880
 at 8 pm local time 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.370
 the trinitarios add only five points of the 27 that have disputed 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.489
 and they come on a three-game losing streak where they have scored only one 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.620
 goal although the registration ones are given a hope since at home the 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.310
 Red and Black have fallen to Mexico only once in four games but it will be 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.540
 the tati will not be able to count on and this logo bupa care both suspended 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.410
 something that Mexico will try to take advantage of to try to extend its run of 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.120
 five consecutive victories 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.910
 and depending on costa rica get the first place in this hexagonal but 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.340
 plays something that especially at the beginning of the campaign was 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.340
 he fascinated by getting only two wins in eight games 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.520
 In addition to the injured, he has not two saints, the Basque Aguirre will not be able to 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.919
 influence frank guillermo who had to return to his club nor to the captain and 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.979
 newly recovered Ricardo Marquez who is suspended for accumulation of 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:47.990
 cards 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.139
 well things 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.849
 final lines and points in his return on Friday with a full 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:56.949
 summary of what these 2010 concacaf qualifiers were and with 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:01.150
 this we go to our window to the confederation with the world sub-20 of 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.919
 Egypt-2009 where on Tuesday the youth of Costa Rica fell by the 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:06.789
 minimum account 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:08.470
 before its similar from brazil 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.150

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.960
 lonely both of victory for the South Americans was scored by Alan 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.960
 kardec at minute 67 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.160
 and now the escrache prepares to face ghana for the title but 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.110
 beyond the result the Ticos who were the only representatives of 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.599
 concacaf still alive 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:30.320
 they return with a great achievement 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.400
 after being the first tricolor team to make it to the semifinals in a 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.210
 fifa official tournament 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.279

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:46.800
 go to england 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.439

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:50.180
 the olympia of honduras 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.460
