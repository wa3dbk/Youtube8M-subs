00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.580 
we see that despite how strong oh there
is<00:00:49.890> as<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.219> jungler<00:00:50.609> the<00:00:51.149> enemy<00:00:51.510> Shaco<00:00:51.870> was<00:00:52.140> able

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
are two examples of how I deal with

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.229 
are two examples of how I deal with
counter<00:01:01.230> junglers<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.519> first<00:01:02.760> game<00:01:03.030> I'm

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
counter junglers in the first game I'm

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.479 
counter junglers in the first game I'm
on<00:01:03.390> purple<00:01:03.809> side<00:01:04.019> facing<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.530> jungle<00:01:04.860> rengar<00:01:05.220> I

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
on purple side facing a jungle rengar I

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.820 
on purple side facing a jungle rengar I
figured<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.420> rengar<00:01:06.750> will<00:01:06.960> try<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.350> kill<00:01:07.650> me

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
figured that rengar will try to kill me

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.130 
figured that rengar will try to kill me
at<00:01:07.980> my<00:01:08.100> blue<00:01:08.310> buff<00:01:08.520> if<00:01:08.730> I<00:01:09.270> start<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.600> grump<00:01:09.870> as

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
at my blue buff if I start a grump as

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.430 
at my blue buff if I start a grump as
usual<00:01:11.060> since<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.180> can't<00:01:12.420> fight<00:01:12.630> rengar<00:01:13.020> early

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
usual since I can't fight rengar early

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.380 
usual since I can't fight rengar early
on<00:01:13.620> and<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.070> can't<00:01:14.340> rely<00:01:14.610> on<00:01:14.640> teammates<00:01:15.240> to

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
on and it can't rely on teammates to

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.690 
on and it can't rely on teammates to
bail<00:01:15.570> me<00:01:15.750> out<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:16.230> decided<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.280> go<00:01:17.430> on<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
bail me out I decided to go on the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.760 
bail me out I decided to go on the
offensive<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.570> 1<00:01:18.750> minute<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.170> 40<00:01:19.410> seconds

offensive and a 1 minute and 40 seconds

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.310 
offensive and a 1 minute and 40 seconds
I<00:01:20.010> go<00:01:20.580> into<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.000> enemy<00:01:21.300> jungle<00:01:21.660> and<00:01:21.870> start<00:01:22.170> at

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
I go into the enemy jungle and start at

I go into the enemy jungle and start at

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
levels one way to go about this is to

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.120 
levels one way to go about this is to
take<00:04:25.240> both<00:04:25.570> the<00:04:25.750> topside<00:04:26.229> jungle<00:04:26.620> buffs<00:04:26.830> and

the other way to do this

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.750 
the other way to do this
is<00:04:28.810> to<00:04:29.020> start<00:04:29.290> at<00:04:29.440> your<00:04:29.710> bottom<00:04:29.920> side<00:04:30.250> buff<00:04:30.490> and

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
is to start at your bottom side buff and

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.720 
is to start at your bottom side buff and
work<00:04:31.300> your<00:04:31.540> way<00:04:31.660> up<00:04:31.690> top<00:04:32.140> in<00:04:32.770> either<00:04:33.100> case<00:04:33.430> this

work your way up top in either case this

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.760 
work your way up top in either case this

will throw off counter junglers who

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.830 
will throw off counter junglers who
normally<00:04:36.280> do<00:04:36.430> not<00:04:36.610> encounter<00:04:36.910> these<00:04:37.240> counter
