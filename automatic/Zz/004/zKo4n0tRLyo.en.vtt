00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:27.190
 here we had a real problem in 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:30.730
 what is the tomato 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.560
 where we were already a little distressed 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.950
 truth is that we could not control it 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.950
 the 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.270
 one had gotten her a bad re like 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:44.450
 true but and now we are seeing 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.970
 that the tomato is already there 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.850
 recovering with the microorganisms of 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.450
 mountain that we are applying it to 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.570
 foliage now 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:58.810
 here you see the production that is taking 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:02.800
 after he had already left 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:05.290
 true a little stuck the micro 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.080
 organisms is functioning in the 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.830
 system that is the 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:15.250
 the production of the plant we want 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.690
 make this emphasis on the benefits 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.760
 really what they have 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.200
 mountain microorganisms this crop 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.180
 of tomato this 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.340
 in the first stage of growth to 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.020
 this height more or less that has a 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.350
 one and a half meters began to have problems 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.630
 really serious about what this is and they are 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.250
 early and late blight this disease 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.530
 it is technically very difficult 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.110
 control them when they are already in 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.579
 cultivation in a traditional system the 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.770
 producers when they already have this 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.990
 rick problem usually have it 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.539
 what they do is that the harvest reaches 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:53.180
 there then it is important that now 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:55.280
 let's make this this difference that 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.890
 We were already with serious problems 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.660
 we are a little disappointed with the 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.420
 cultivation we thought that I was not going to continue 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.940
 but we started to apply microorganisms 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.580
 of mountains activated in pure form and 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.410
 foliage applications every two days what 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.980
 that has allowed us to after that 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.830
 you got here the problem of blight is 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.690
 this plant has grown already and has new 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.959
 new crops have here we can see 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.660
 new segments with production is to say that 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:27.470
 it was interrupted for a while but now 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.910
 they continue that is very important because if 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.310
 it would not have been for microorganisms was 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.920
 very difficult that we could continue 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.020
 producing besides that I would like 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.640
 also a little see the difference of the 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.150
 microbiological activity in the soil 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.790
 because when we work this in this 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.190
 culture normally this this soil 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.350
 I was like pretty hard and you 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.260
 can see here the difference we have 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.980
 now this ground has already worked with 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:58.099
 applications of organic fertilizer boccazzi 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.290
 to 8 days and after we apply the 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.569
 fertilizer that we apply to you 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.090
 microorganisms also to the ground we 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.099
 is allowing to see improvements in the soil 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.409
 that normally in other systems are 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:12.890
 very difficult that we can have this 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:15.170
 soil right now we can compare it with what 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.690
 that we had here on the natural ground if 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.680
 you could see here a floor 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:24.069
 hard then to see the difference with 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.940
 the soil already organically worked 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.280
 You can perfectly see the difference 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.590
 that for us I think it has also 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.170
 been like the experience in which this 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.720
 tomato crop that is handled here 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.180
 be under the conditions of a house 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:42.739
 maya has been able to improve that we have already 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:47.090
 harvested although when it came east this 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:49.670
 the problem of de taco we could also 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.370
 have already fruits that went on lasting 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.620
 but that were not affected this as 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.410
 we can see here when they arrive blight is 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.080
 in growing normally also will 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.750
 a stain comes the fruits 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:06.170
 that means that the system of 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.870
 organic management is totally kind 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.170
 for that for the subject of production 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.540
 in the greenhouses they are handled in stock 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.640
 or are handled in qüetta this system is 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.290
 a system that is the ground which 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.690
 allows the plant to have the 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.000
 conditions of the soil and be 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.800
 covers with the Mayan house to avoid all 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.660
 insect problems but here 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.850
 inside the greenhouse for some 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.010
 natural soil conditions but the most 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.710
 successful of this is that it was possible to control 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.840
 the tails and that now the plant 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.720
 he did not die and we have hope of 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.790
 production during possibly ones 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.849
 three to four months more things than in 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:46.969
 other conditions would have been impossible 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:48.939
 I eat as a producer as a worker 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:53.509
 can be had the experience of seeing 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:56.749
 the tomato that yes that we thought that already 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:05:00.600
 it was going to be lost that we had to 

00:04:56.749 --> 00:05:02.670
 I was going to produce better but 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.129
 but serving that with the microorganism 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.349
 of Mountain 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:11.939
 apply the application has not worked 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:14.759
 then we see that if in the first 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:19.050
 experiences that one has had as 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:21.500
 organic producer and I see that the 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:25.740
 tomato 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:30.350
 this one that takes a trip of which it is seen 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.350
 that we will continue to produce more 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:42.580
 my hands produce sowing the earth 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.200
 if we all sow there will be no more 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:48.169
 working in the field and martín to the 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.830
 life itself they produce us sowing the 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:51.620
 land 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:55.120
 If we all sow more misery 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.120
 working in the field
