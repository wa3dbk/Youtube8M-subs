00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.060 

so<00:00:08.760> I'm<00:00:09.000> going<00:00:09.180> to<00:00:09.240> show<00:00:09.540> you<00:00:09.570> how<00:00:10.260> to

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.000 

thing<00:00:13.219> together<00:00:13.490> and<00:00:14.349> grafting<00:00:15.349> is<00:00:15.469> a<00:00:15.530> really

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
thing together and grafting is a really

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.589 
thing together and grafting is a really
nice<00:00:16.219> way<00:00:16.610> of<00:00:16.910> sewing<00:00:18.760> basically<00:00:19.760> cast<00:00:20.330> on<00:00:20.570> or

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:20.599 
nice way of sewing basically cast on or

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:22.450 
nice way of sewing basically cast on or
cast<00:00:21.020> off<00:00:21.320> bits<00:00:21.619> of<00:00:21.770> stocking<00:00:22.220> stitch

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
cast off bits of stocking stitch

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.130 
cast off bits of stocking stitch
together<00:00:22.939> so<00:00:23.180> I'm<00:00:23.270> going<00:00:23.419> to<00:00:23.480> put<00:00:23.630> these<00:00:23.810> two

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
together so I'm going to put these two

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.440 
together so I'm going to put these two
pieces<00:00:24.169> together<00:00:24.860> and<00:00:25.400> the<00:00:25.939> way<00:00:26.060> I'm<00:00:26.210> going<00:00:26.360> to

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.450 
pieces together and the way I'm going to

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.120 
pieces together and the way I'm going to
do<00:00:26.689> it<00:00:26.930> is<00:00:28.750> by<00:00:29.750> actually<00:00:30.170> creating<00:00:30.560> the

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
do it is by actually creating the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.970 
do it is by actually creating the
knitted<00:00:31.460> stitch<00:00:31.789> using<00:00:32.509> a<00:00:32.900> needle<00:00:33.110> and<00:00:33.320> piece

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
knitted stitch using a needle and piece

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.030 
knitted stitch using a needle and piece
of<00:00:34.190> yarn<00:00:34.460> so<00:00:35.059> you<00:00:35.090> can't<00:00:35.510> really<00:00:35.989> see<00:00:36.650> the<00:00:36.800> join

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
of yarn so you can't really see the join

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.400 
of yarn so you can't really see the join
and<00:00:37.850> so<00:00:38.089> it<00:00:38.180> looks<00:00:38.330> like<00:00:38.390> I've<00:00:38.660> just<00:00:38.690> created

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
and so it looks like I've just created

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.340 
and so it looks like I've just created
an<00:00:39.530> extra<00:00:40.129> row<00:00:40.430> of<00:00:40.580> stitches<00:00:41.120> here<00:00:41.540> now<00:00:42.199> if

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
an extra row of stitches here now if

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.660 
an extra row of stitches here now if
you're<00:00:42.500> doing<00:00:42.800> my<00:00:44.079> alphabet<00:00:45.079> blanket<00:00:45.829> then

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
you're doing my alphabet blanket then

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.160 
you're doing my alphabet blanket then
you<00:00:46.940> will<00:00:47.059> have<00:00:47.210> lots<00:00:47.510> of<00:00:47.660> different<00:00:47.930> kind<00:00:48.110> of

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
you will have lots of different kind of

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.350 
you will have lots of different kind of
squares<00:00:48.530> like<00:00:48.860> these<00:00:49.219> and<00:00:49.670> you<00:00:49.789> want<00:00:49.940> to<00:00:50.149> sew

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
squares like these and you want to sew

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.369 
squares like these and you want to sew
them<00:00:50.510> all<00:00:50.629> together<00:00:50.840> in<00:00:51.590> a<00:00:52.250> long<00:00:52.730> column<00:00:53.629> first

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
them all together in a long column first

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.590 
them all together in a long column first
and<00:00:54.920> you<00:00:55.460> need<00:00:55.699> to<00:00:55.969> use<00:00:56.329> the<00:00:56.840> color<00:00:57.170> of<00:00:57.550> the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
and you need to use the color of the

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.529 
and you need to use the color of the
letter<00:00:59.600> that<00:00:59.809> goes<00:01:00.230> above<00:01:00.760> for<00:01:01.760> your<00:01:01.879> grafting

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
letter that goes above for your grafting

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.960 
letter that goes above for your grafting
all<00:01:03.230> the<00:01:03.410> way<00:01:03.559> through<00:01:03.890> so<00:01:04.250> for<00:01:04.550> I'm<00:01:04.759> going<00:01:04.910> to

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
all the way through so for I'm going to

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.480 
all the way through so for I'm going to
join<00:01:05.149> D<00:01:05.479> and<00:01:05.660> H<00:01:05.750> here<00:01:06.140> together<00:01:06.350> and<00:01:06.830> I'm<00:01:07.310> going

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
join D and H here together and I'm going

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.469 
join D and H here together and I'm going
to<00:01:07.520> use<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:08.360> sugared<00:01:09.259> almond<00:01:09.680> color<00:01:10.009> to<00:01:10.970> graft

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
to use the sugared almond color to graft

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.080 
to use the sugared almond color to graft
these<00:01:11.780> two<00:01:12.080> pieces<00:01:12.440> together<00:01:12.830> but<00:01:13.729> if<00:01:13.910> you're

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
these two pieces together but if you're

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.940 
these two pieces together but if you're
grafting<00:01:14.840> anything<00:01:15.229> else<00:01:15.380> it<00:01:15.530> doesn't<00:01:15.679> matter

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
grafting anything else it doesn't matter

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.140 
grafting anything else it doesn't matter
you're<00:01:16.130> probably<00:01:16.310> just<00:01:16.550> using<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:16.940> same

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
you're probably just using the same

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.649 
you're probably just using the same
color<00:01:17.450> so<00:01:17.930> it's<00:01:18.890> a<00:01:19.009> bit<00:01:19.159> simpler<00:01:19.610> now<00:01:20.240> first<00:01:20.540> of

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
color so it's a bit simpler now first of

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.020 
color so it's a bit simpler now first of
all<00:01:20.750> you<00:01:20.810> need<00:01:20.960> a<00:01:21.020> length<00:01:21.350> of<00:01:21.680> yarn<00:01:22.100> throw<00:01:22.909> it

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
all you need a length of yarn throw it

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.300 
all you need a length of yarn throw it
on<00:01:23.150> to<00:01:23.420> a<00:01:23.450> a<00:01:24.729> sewing<00:01:25.729> up<00:01:25.939> needle<00:01:26.590> now<00:01:27.590> when<00:01:28.220> you

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
on to a a sewing up needle now when you

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.160 
on to a a sewing up needle now when you
look<00:01:28.460> at<00:01:28.640> your<00:01:28.820> stitches<00:01:29.450> before<00:01:29.720> we<00:01:29.840> start

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
look at your stitches before we start

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.499 
look at your stitches before we start
it's<00:01:30.409> probably<00:01:30.680> just<00:01:30.920> worth<00:01:31.270> dissecting<00:01:32.270> the

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
it's probably just worth dissecting the

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.649 
it's probably just worth dissecting the
knitted<00:01:32.840> stitch<00:01:33.170> and<00:01:33.979> if<00:01:34.100> you<00:01:34.280> can<00:01:34.490> see<00:01:34.880> here

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
knitted stitch and if you can see here

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.109 
knitted stitch and if you can see here
if<00:01:36.619> we<00:01:36.740> look<00:01:36.890> at<00:01:36.979> this<00:01:37.100> stitch<00:01:37.400> here<00:01:37.700> every

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
if we look at this stitch here every

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.810 
if we look at this stitch here every
stitch<00:01:38.420> of<00:01:38.689> stocking<00:01:39.140> stitch<00:01:39.409> is<00:01:39.740> a<00:01:39.979> V<00:01:40.430> so

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
stitch of stocking stitch is a V so

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.580 
stitch of stocking stitch is a V so
you've<00:01:40.939> got<00:01:41.119> one<00:01:41.360> side<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.840> V<00:01:42.020> there<00:01:42.259> and

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
you've got one side the V there and

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.130 
you've got one side the V there and
there's<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.460> other<00:01:43.549> side<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:44.090> V<00:01:44.299> and<00:01:44.930> when

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
there's the other side the V and when

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.080 
there's the other side the V and when
we're<00:01:45.290> grafting<00:01:45.829> you<00:01:45.950> need<00:01:46.100> to<00:01:46.310> focus<00:01:46.520> on<00:01:46.939> the

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
we're grafting you need to focus on the

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.240 
we're grafting you need to focus on the
center<00:01:47.540> of<00:01:47.659> the<00:01:47.810> V<00:01:47.990> which<00:01:48.470> is<00:01:48.500> there<00:01:48.950> and

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
center of the V which is there and

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.319 
center of the V which is there and
either<00:01:50.210> side<00:01:50.659> of<00:01:50.689> the<00:01:51.020> V<00:01:51.340> which<00:01:52.340> is<00:01:52.640> there<00:01:53.000> and

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
either side of the V which is there and

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.050 
either side of the V which is there and
there<00:01:53.840> okay<00:01:54.310> and<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.369> bottom<00:01:55.790> piece<00:01:56.030> of

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
there okay and the bottom piece of

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.819 
there okay and the bottom piece of
knitting<00:01:56.329> we're<00:01:56.719> always<00:01:56.960> going<00:01:57.409> into<00:01:57.710> the

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
knitting we're always going into the

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.609 
knitting we're always going into the
center<00:01:58.040> of<00:01:58.250> the<00:01:59.149> V<00:01:59.360> and<00:01:59.390> the<00:01:59.930> top<00:02:00.170> piece<00:02:00.409> were

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
center of the V and the top piece were

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.160 
center of the V and the top piece were
always<00:02:00.829> going<00:02:01.189> round<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:01.820> V<00:02:02.000> so<00:02:02.780> hopefully

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
always going round the V so hopefully

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.069 
always going round the V so hopefully
that<00:02:03.290> will<00:02:03.380> become<00:02:03.469> clear<00:02:04.009> while<00:02:04.610> we<00:02:04.820> go<00:02:05.600> along

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
that will become clear while we go along

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.190 
that will become clear while we go along
the<00:02:06.290> knitting<00:02:06.969> so<00:02:07.969> first<00:02:08.239> of<00:02:08.390> all<00:02:08.479> see<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.049> bit

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
the knitting so first of all see the bit

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.130 
the knitting so first of all see the bit
in<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.380> corner<00:02:09.739> is<00:02:09.860> really<00:02:10.250> tricky<00:02:10.480> but<00:02:11.480> my<00:02:11.780> I

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
in the corner is really tricky but my I

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.520 
in the corner is really tricky but my I
know<00:02:12.620> that<00:02:13.010> this<00:02:13.130> is<00:02:13.280> 17<00:02:13.790> stitches<00:02:14.120> long<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:15.440> I

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
know that this is 17 stitches long and I

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.979 
know that this is 17 stitches long and I
also<00:02:15.739> know<00:02:16.250> that<00:02:16.610> I<00:02:16.970> just<00:02:17.329> need<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.630> go<00:02:17.780> into

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
also know that I just need to go into

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.350 
also know that I just need to go into
the<00:02:18.110> center<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.650> V<00:02:18.829> just<00:02:19.160> on<00:02:19.670> this<00:02:19.880> right<00:02:20.150> hand

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
the center the V just on this right hand

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.050 
the center the V just on this right hand
corner<00:02:20.959> so<00:02:21.530> it's<00:02:21.799> easy<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.190> see<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.400> second

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
corner so it's easy to see the second

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.380 
corner so it's easy to see the second
stitch

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390
