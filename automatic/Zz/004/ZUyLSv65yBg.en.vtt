00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:06.439
 Hey guys and here i am buying the i watch now the community has something 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:10.499
 Also, the conservation of the Katar not the declared Zschau 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:14.360
 and now I show you my father has already seen at home 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.319
 Streller 

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:16.179
 RP 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:17.090
 around 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.210
 but a cross here you see herbs and sounds AFK had extreme 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.329
 boring 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:28.529
 but m I have to explain again that here is a direction so one 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.749
 two-step what the other direction 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.749
 in the design makes the race 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.910
 this one on the side you drive there long after the command action 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.040
 Christians 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.329
 as the England is actually now a case of I think that Gaza from above 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.429
 It took me an awful lot of time to get a fur hat 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.310
 it's also quite complicated yes i just built the intersection and by doing so 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.370
 further developed because that is supposed to be everything for the city the Dambacher 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.989
 Theater man as trouble burning 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:01.859
 the nice weather Dennis percent 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.220
 that the ECB has to put Norman on 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.220
 that is this problem 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.159
 Decades later, the easy thing about it is easy for me 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.570
 would not have him the duty for the open source and the environment 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.890
 Wetzlar were 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:19.810
 work that way 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.600
 then, of course, everything has to make a lot of noise I can 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.560
 constantly in the way and even a few times as we or 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.640
 dodge 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.600
 which tel 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.890
 you do not take it 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.890
 with which customer when the principle so you could this 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.820
 so it says at this stage, tell you my husband is on this level 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.280
 corresponding too fast 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.350
 on this track a few accumulated leaves hit the stand I had 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.740
 just find it 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.750
 The school in America has actually ruined the chancellor 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.450
 we will see again 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.649
 I hope briefly with the only daughter worst fix so right 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.500
 firm voice is from the 7th 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.890
 back in Sirte 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.030
 Deal as long as the old ones do it all 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.319
 receive 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:09.799
 dpa SchÃ¤chter 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:10.549
 Polke 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.159
 So you could easily slowed down the fathers of this roughage 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.559
 I deserve to be energized 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:19.839
 if we get to that divide, in my case that more will be deployed 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:21.269
 Herten glasshouse 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.269
 and here now left to the left of these two tracks 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.249
 one always drives one can always turn left on the right defender 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:28.719
 on 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:31.549
 can either start from the message for rulers 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.169
 but then out 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:37.169
 Winterstein's other boss Mike Ott 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.409
 I'm going to protect it for a while 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:44.819
 Bochumer can do that 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.329
 I thank you for the so-called 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.709
 he can look here again either one drives straight through IT 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.209
 off followed by off 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.389
 which often haggled judges new chaos was again rather parried up 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.489
 and then, of course, slowed down some degree 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:04.609
 up to 2 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.249
 Persevere, "it once said a bit hard because it really is 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:11.589
 no longer Ellens alike but needs to be concerned 

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:15.809
 You have to do it everywhere and because of good traders so hard 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:18.179
 and to make that clear 

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:22.239
 Rashy because that's a bit bigger among the pet owners just once 

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:25.929
 because for the little trip tip 

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:29.929
 because we always come over 

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:32.929
 I showed somewhere 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.059
 Percent the 8th 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.980
 I understand 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.790
 one could indecently have that 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.829
 the keys it goes without saying 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.630
 flirtatious 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.549
 yes that is one 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.549
 simply kept it simple with her not always done so 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:53.909
 and, of course, beautiful lighting, of course, one thing is for sure 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.909
 Percent is yes so regulated 

00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:59.810
 and that's extreme, of course 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.749
 made a lot of work 

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:06.949
 Pfizer need called awesome job I would do the same thing times 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:08.499
 here the one-lane is over 

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:13.209
 that is easier it is around the picture he will also like to do if Voigt me 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.799
 would know where such a person and consumption 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:16.919
 if Kate 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.060
 Hamburg Rossi was because that's really quite complicated for people 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.309
 like me the 10 o'clock big IOC to things 

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:26.139
 but off 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.280
 "But I will never sponsor myself had the most rain myself 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.909
 but not with the freight 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:36.059
 so have gotten special stuff from ANANDA 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.139
 So again I have said as much work in it percent I've got 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:41.919
 there 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.050
 no idea 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.629
 five six days 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:46.919
 I have not been there for so long 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.240
 Percent 40 celebrated regrets that I know how to build everything 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.380
 not as much 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.919
 that had too much time all the time 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.779
 and so on 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:57.580
 he has buck Robin Moller 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.379
 around 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:00.240
 is she really sounds 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.520
 as if the individual parties went on and everything went 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.840
 Although trying to build it yourself 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.669
 I hereby to the double eliminated and thereby offended and 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:11.099
 around 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:14.879
 It's really extremely heavy all over the dark circle 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:15.439
 demonstrate 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:17.259
 that's why I really would 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:20.729
 In fact, during the week, I always have clouds of smoke for me 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.180
 of copper or something like that 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.180
 Something also Cougar criticism I find good but 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:30.729
 I really want to follow the extreme clock that cost me a lot of work 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:32.589
 around 

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:35.139
 and also become a sensible city 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:36.970
 yes, you can already see it here 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.050
 Mundt goes under us everything becomes 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.259
 since there are quite similar to similar 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:45.259
 I think it has become the ship with the trophy 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:48.470
 generally the philosophers Edmund Stoiber 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.450
 she also wants to see the waking and torches on the ground but haunts her 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.450
 always off 

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:56.240
 Yes 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.240
 I know she inherited the city is not 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:02.759
 I think what the opponents of the government are not 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.619
 Perfect driving 

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:12.249
 BZ talk with video about everytime we commit him 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.819
 60 people from above are a bit strange 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:21.029
 I've got the OSCE extruder so unfamiliar with it 

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:23.119
 also not so great and 

00:06:23.119 --> 00:06:26.309
 so the file east is not so big but 

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:28.249
 Craig Gillespie asked to see 

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:32.599
 So that was the last word for this intersection 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:34.589
 to look is weather right 

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:37.059
 agree one for the construction 

00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:40.499
 and the web server sticks it all out that it's too complicated 

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:44.289
 if he wants to protect a brittle with a simple form 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:48.979
 Vettel also made sure to write in the comments or just as well 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:50.080
 under 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.729
 my wish Heuel so this video 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:56.419
 With tax data EURUSD could give off wood if I also use the technique 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:06:58.669
 in the picture 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:01.479
 If he had written a comment there 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:04.249
 That's what it's all about at the podium and I do not know 

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:07.960
 yes so it says important i really think we were way too high or 

00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:09.899
 Criticism or suggestions from outside 

00:07:09.899 --> 00:07:12.289
 to say something percent means 

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:13.830
 is really successful 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.499
 Dr the whole lot of work was 

00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:18.139
 taken to the city 

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:20.330
 larger 

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.460
 real solid that had grown 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.570
 He is also going to make the CEO and then get ready then 

00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:28.779
 Of course, a detailed comes from the CEO 

00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:33.249
 Pulling out of this fabric for length is going around and then the day is over 

00:07:33.249 --> 00:07:34.399
 watch 

00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:37.369
 As I've always said before commenting I forgot Falsterbo 

00:07:37.369 --> 00:07:38.730
 Cards you liked 

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:41.460
 and then until next time I work
