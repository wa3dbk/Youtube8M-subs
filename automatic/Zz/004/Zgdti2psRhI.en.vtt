00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
alright so this first level is pretty

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.399 
alright so this first level is pretty
straightforward<00:01:11.869> it's<00:01:12.869> just<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.110> one-on-one

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.649 
bottom there are rocket launchers on
either<00:01:29.280> side<00:01:29.640> now<00:01:34.700> I'm<00:01:35.700> using<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.090> Dreamcast

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
either side now I'm using the Dreamcast

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.910 
either side now I'm using the Dreamcast
keyboard<00:01:37.050> and<00:01:37.200> mouse<00:01:37.290> for<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.680> playthrough

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
keyboard and mouse for this playthrough

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.859 
keyboard and mouse for this playthrough
that's<00:01:38.729> why<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.909> want<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.180> do<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.479> master

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
that's why I want to do it on master

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.230 
that's why I want to do it on master
difficulty<00:01:40.440> just<00:01:41.009> because<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.310> haven't<00:01:41.550> really

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
difficulty just because I haven't really

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.940 
difficulty just because I haven't really
ever<00:01:42.360> used<00:01:42.690> the<00:01:42.840> keyboard<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.289> mouse<00:01:43.410> before

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
ever used the keyboard and mouse before

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.010 
ever used the keyboard and mouse before
I<00:01:43.979> mean<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.310> played<00:01:44.429> shooters<00:01:44.940> before<00:01:45.119> but<00:01:45.570> it

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
I mean I played shooters before but it

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.120 
I mean I played shooters before but it
feels<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.320> little<00:01:46.530> bit<00:01:46.619> different<00:01:46.950> on<00:01:46.979> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
feels a little bit different on the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.690 
feels a little bit different on the
Dreamcast

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
Dreamcast

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.520 
Dreamcast
especially<00:01:48.090> since<00:01:48.300> I'm<00:01:48.929> used<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.320> playing

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
especially since I'm used to playing

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.620 
especially since I'm used to playing
this<00:01:49.679> game<00:01:49.830> with<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.070> controller<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.850> we'll<00:01:51.479> see

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
this game with a controller so we'll see

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.600 
this game with a controller so we'll see
how<00:01:51.750> far<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.020> get<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.500> might<00:01:53.220> have<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.460> switch

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
how far I get I might have to switch

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.950 
how far I get I might have to switch
back<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.060> controller<00:01:54.420> if<00:01:54.630> it's<00:01:54.780> too

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
back to the controller if it's too

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:27.130 
back to the controller if it's too
difficult

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.360 

now<00:02:28.140> just<00:02:28.350> some<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.590> basics<00:02:29.010> each<00:02:29.130> weapon

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.430 
now just some of the basics each weapon
has<00:02:29.580> an<00:02:29.910> alternate<00:02:30.300> fire<00:02:30.510> with<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.020> rockets

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810
