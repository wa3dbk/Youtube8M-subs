different i started at all it's true

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.130 
different i started at all it's true
that<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.430> stages<00:02:59.850> are<00:02:59.880> longer<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:00.990> it

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
that the stages are longer and so it

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.680 
that the stages are longer and so it
