00:00:00.419 --> 00:00:03.000
 Mayday - DNA 

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:06.000
 Song / Word: Ashin Arranger: Mayday 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:18.510
 Who used my toothpaste? 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.780
 Who is wearing my shoes and jacket? 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.790
 Who is taking a shower in my house? 

00:00:24.799 --> 00:00:28.120
 He looks like me before the mirror 

00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:31.220
 Who moved into my brain 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:34.020
 Who tied my hands and feet 

00:00:34.029 --> 00:00:37.550
 Is DNA sings me against 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.930
 Still my destiny is not self-directed 

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:44.190
 If you want to call it, then you can call it and jump. 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.300
 Jump higher, don’t rely on the heart, the gunpowder 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.000
 Do you want someone to help you decide? 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.490
 Ok, now I’m going back to my heartbeat. 

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:57.860
 Own heartbeat 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.890
 Who is always saying that there is enough decline? 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.020
 Who is the only one who prays? 

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:12.140
 Who is being wanted to escape? 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.410
 The crime is kidnapping his own smile 

00:01:15.419 --> 00:01:18.500
 Who moved into my brain 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.540
 Who tied my hands and feet 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.670
 Is DNA sings me against 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:28.470
 Still my destiny is not self-directed 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.620
 If you want to call it, then you can call it and jump. 

00:01:31.629 --> 00:01:34.640
 Jump higher, don’t rely on the heart, the gunpowder 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.830
 Do you want someone to help you decide? 

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:42.490
 Ok, now I’m going back to my heartbeat. 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.660
 If you want to call it, then you can call it and jump. 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:15.720
 Jump higher, don’t rely on the heart, the gunpowder 

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:18.930
 Do you want someone to help you decide? 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:22.550
 Ok, now I’m going back to my heartbeat. 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:28.120
 Heartbeat jumps and runs
