00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
video okay so to start things off we're

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.840 
video okay so to start things off we're
going<00:00:53.350> to<00:00:53.410> reset<00:00:53.800> our<00:00:53.920> image<00:00:54.280> and<00:00:54.519> we're<00:00:54.730> going

going to reset our image and we're going

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.700 
going to reset our image and we're going
to<00:00:54.879> go<00:00:55.000> to<00:00:55.059> the<00:00:55.210> develop<00:00:55.660> tab<00:00:55.899> up<00:00:56.170> here<00:00:56.230> and

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
to go to the develop tab up here and

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.419 
to go to the develop tab up here and
start<00:00:57.699> at<00:00:57.879> the<00:00:58.000> very<00:00:58.210> top<00:00:58.649> okay<00:00:59.649> so<00:00:59.710> the<00:01:00.219> first

00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:00.429 
start at the very top okay so the first

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:02.790 
start at the very top okay so the first
thing<00:01:00.579> we<00:01:00.670> see<00:01:00.850> is<00:01:01.090> white<00:01:01.359> balance<00:01:01.750> now<00:01:02.260> you

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
thing we see is white balance now you

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.250 
thing we see is white balance now you
can<00:01:02.949> either<00:01:03.100> set<00:01:03.399> this<00:01:03.550> to<00:01:03.820> as<00:01:04.120> shot<00:01:04.570> adjust<00:01:05.140> it

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
can either set this to as shot adjust it

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.830 
can either set this to as shot adjust it
manually<00:01:05.560> or<00:01:05.860> you<00:01:06.700> know<00:01:06.820> select<00:01:07.120> a<00:01:07.210> preset<00:01:07.420> now

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
manually or you know select a preset now

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.900 
manually or you know select a preset now
the<00:01:07.900> way<00:01:08.080> I<00:01:08.110> usually<00:01:08.590> do<00:01:08.770> it<00:01:08.890> is<00:01:09.070> select<00:01:09.550> order

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
the way I usually do it is select order

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.850 
the way I usually do it is select order
and<00:01:10.180> then<00:01:10.390> adjust<00:01:10.990> it<00:01:11.080> from<00:01:11.200> there<00:01:11.290> to<00:01:11.740> my

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
and then adjust it from there to my

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.420 
and then adjust it from there to my
taste

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
taste

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.980 
taste
since<00:01:12.670> auto<00:01:13.030> usually<00:01:13.450> does<00:01:13.600> a<00:01:13.630> pretty<00:01:13.930> good

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
since auto usually does a pretty good

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.570 
since auto usually does a pretty good
job<00:01:14.140> of<00:01:14.410> figuring<00:01:14.590> out<00:01:14.890> where<00:01:15.130> it's<00:01:15.250> meant<00:01:15.400> to

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
job of figuring out where it's meant to

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.670 
job of figuring out where it's meant to
be<00:01:15.700> and<00:01:16.000> then<00:01:16.300> you<00:01:16.330> can<00:01:16.510> stylize<00:01:17.350> it<00:01:17.380> a<00:01:17.530> bit

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
be and then you can stylize it a bit

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.680 
be and then you can stylize it a bit
from<00:01:17.830> there<00:01:18.040> you<00:01:18.580> can<00:01:18.730> also<00:01:18.850> select<00:01:19.150> black<00:01:19.510> and

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
from there you can also select black and

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.390 
from there you can also select black and
white<00:01:19.840> or<00:01:20.200> you<00:01:20.590> can<00:01:20.740> use<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:21.040> white<00:01:21.190> balance

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
white or you can use the white balance

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.700 
white or you can use the white balance
selector<00:01:21.670> which<00:01:22.420> I<00:01:22.780> don't<00:01:23.020> usually<00:01:23.140> use<00:01:23.350> all

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
selector which I don't usually use all

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.560 
selector which I don't usually use all
of<00:01:23.860> that<00:01:23.890> much<00:01:24.340> asked<00:01:24.850> that<00:01:25.120> seems<00:01:25.390> pretty

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
of that much asked that seems pretty

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.970 
of that much asked that seems pretty
good<00:01:25.780> for<00:01:25.960> now<00:01:26.050> now<00:01:26.350> if<00:01:26.410> you<00:01:26.530> go<00:01:26.650> down<00:01:26.830> to

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:26.980 
good for now now if you go down to

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.290 
good for now now if you go down to
exposure<00:01:27.370> you<00:01:27.520> can<00:01:27.640> either<00:01:27.820> click<00:01:27.970> the<00:01:28.150> auto

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
exposure you can either click the auto

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.360 
exposure you can either click the auto
button<00:01:28.540> to<00:01:28.780> help<00:01:28.930> sort<00:01:29.260> it<00:01:29.380> all<00:01:29.470> out<00:01:29.650> but<00:01:29.980> it's

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
button to help sort it all out but it's

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.130 
button to help sort it all out but it's
obviously<00:01:31.210> not<00:01:31.390> as<00:01:31.540> good<00:01:31.690> as<00:01:31.810> doing<00:01:31.960> it

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
obviously not as good as doing it

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.890 
obviously not as good as doing it
yourself<00:01:32.260> since<00:01:33.160> the<00:01:33.730> program<00:01:34.180> doesn't<00:01:34.720> have

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
yourself since the program doesn't have

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.110 
yourself since the program doesn't have
the<00:01:35.020> same<00:01:35.200> taste<00:01:35.470> in<00:01:35.620> pictures<00:01:35.950> as<00:01:36.070> you<00:01:36.120> so

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
the same taste in pictures as you so

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.010 
the same taste in pictures as you so
what<00:01:37.240> I'm<00:01:37.330> going<00:01:37.450> to<00:01:37.480> do<00:01:37.600> is<00:01:37.720> I'm<00:01:37.840> going<00:01:37.870> to

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.840 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
bring<00:01:38.140> up<00:01:38.290> the<00:01:38.380> exposure<00:01:38.470> here<00:01:39.100> and<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.730> way

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
bring up the exposure here and the way

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.460 
bring up the exposure here and the way
I'm<00:01:39.970> adjusting<00:01:40.420> these<00:01:40.540> sliders<00:01:41.020> is<00:01:41.200> I'm<00:01:41.440> just

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
I'm adjusting these sliders is I'm just

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.050 
I'm adjusting these sliders is I'm just
holding<00:01:41.860> my<00:01:41.950> mouse<00:01:42.130> over<00:01:42.340> that<00:01:42.580> slider<00:01:42.880> and

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
holding my mouse over that slider and

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.910 
holding my mouse over that slider and
using<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.450> up<00:01:43.630> and<00:01:43.780> down<00:01:43.870> arrow<00:01:44.260> keys<00:01:44.410> and

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
using the up and down arrow keys and

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.500 
using the up and down arrow keys and
that<00:01:45.310> way<00:01:45.460> it<00:01:45.550> just<00:01:45.730> jumps<00:01:45.970> up<00:01:46.060> in<00:01:46.240> small

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
that way it just jumps up in small

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.660 
that way it just jumps up in small
amounts<00:01:46.900> instead<00:01:47.320> of<00:01:47.440> using<00:01:47.950> your<00:01:48.100> mouse<00:01:48.340> okay

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
amounts instead of using your mouse okay

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.950 
amounts instead of using your mouse okay
so<00:01:48.880> now<00:01:49.060> that<00:01:49.090> we've<00:01:49.270> done<00:01:49.420> that<00:01:49.600> you<00:01:49.690> can<00:01:49.780> see

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
so now that we've done that you can see

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.210 
so now that we've done that you can see
it<00:01:50.020> helped<00:01:50.200> bring<00:01:50.380> out<00:01:50.500> this<00:01:50.650> lens<00:01:50.860> flare<00:01:51.130> up

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
it helped bring out this lens flare up

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.130 
it helped bring out this lens flare up
in<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.430> tree<00:01:51.640> here<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.630> Sun<00:01:52.840> coming

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
in the tree here and the Sun coming

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.780 
in the tree here and the Sun coming
through<00:01:53.290> the<00:01:53.410> trees<00:01:53.650> okay<00:01:54.160> so<00:01:54.220> we're<00:01:54.580> going<00:01:54.700> to

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
through the trees okay so we're going to

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.520 
through the trees okay so we're going to
skip<00:01:54.940> recovery<00:01:55.480> and<00:01:55.690> fill<00:01:55.960> lights<00:01:56.170> since<00:01:56.410> we

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
skip recovery and fill lights since we

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.750 
skip recovery and fill lights since we
don't<00:01:56.710> need<00:01:56.830> any<00:01:57.070> of<00:01:57.160> that<00:01:57.250> in<00:01:57.430> this<00:01:57.550> specific

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
don't need any of that in this specific

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.000 
don't need any of that in this specific
photo<00:01:58.330> and<00:01:58.600> we<00:01:59.140> might<00:01:59.350> want<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.590> bring<00:01:59.740> up<00:01:59.860> the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
photo and we might want to bring up the

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.280 
photo and we might want to bring up the
black<00:02:00.280> value<00:02:00.850> just<00:02:01.150> a<00:02:01.360> tiny<00:02:01.630> bit<00:02:01.900> okay<00:02:02.260> so

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
black value just a tiny bit okay so

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.720 
black value just a tiny bit okay so
moving<00:02:02.620> down<00:02:02.710> to<00:02:02.920> brightness<00:02:03.310> brightness

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
moving down to brightness brightness

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.370 
moving down to brightness brightness
works<00:02:03.970> someone<00:02:04.330> to<00:02:04.420> exposure<00:02:04.840> however<00:02:05.200> I

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
works someone to exposure however I

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.110 
works someone to exposure however I
think<00:02:05.590> I<00:02:05.860> read<00:02:06.070> somewhere<00:02:06.340> that<00:02:06.490> exposure

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
think I read somewhere that exposure

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.389 
think I read somewhere that exposure
focuses<00:02:07.780> more<00:02:08.020> on<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.590> highlighted<00:02:09.099> parts

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
focuses more on the highlighted parts

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.040 
focuses more on the highlighted parts
but<00:02:09.610> don't<00:02:10.360> quote<00:02:10.509> me<00:02:10.690> on<00:02:10.720> that<00:02:10.840> you're

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
but don't quote me on that you're

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.449 
but don't quote me on that you're
probably<00:02:11.230> better<00:02:11.680> off<00:02:11.770> finding<00:02:12.129> out<00:02:12.340> for

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
probably better off finding out for

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.640 
probably better off finding out for
yourself<00:02:12.790> since<00:02:13.090> I'm<00:02:13.480> not<00:02:14.110> completely<00:02:14.470> sure

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
yourself since I'm not completely sure

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.410 
yourself since I'm not completely sure
myself<00:02:15.159> and<00:02:15.340> I<00:02:15.370> just<00:02:15.400> do<00:02:15.640> it<00:02:15.670> from<00:02:15.819> taste<00:02:16.150> so

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
myself and I just do it from taste so

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.759 
myself and I just do it from taste so
what<00:02:16.510> I'm<00:02:16.569> going<00:02:16.719> to<00:02:16.780> do<00:02:16.900> is<00:02:17.170> I'm<00:02:17.409> going<00:02:17.439> to

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.530 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
bring<00:02:17.920> up<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.219> contrast<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:18.879> little<00:02:18.909> bit<00:02:19.209> and

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
bring up the contrast a little bit and

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.080 
bring up the contrast a little bit and
then

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
then

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.940 
then
up<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:20.629> brightness<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:21.170> compensate<00:02:21.709> for<00:02:21.890> that

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
up the brightness to compensate for that

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.740 
up the brightness to compensate for that
and<00:02:22.280> actually<00:02:22.640> we<00:02:22.730> might<00:02:22.910> go<00:02:23.030> back<00:02:23.209> up<00:02:23.360> to<00:02:23.510> fill

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
and actually we might go back up to fill

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.150 
and actually we might go back up to fill
that<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.080> just<00:02:24.200> bring<00:02:24.410> it<00:02:24.500> up<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.709> five<00:02:24.920> to

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
that and just bring it up to five to

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.309 
that and just bring it up to five to
help<00:02:25.310> bring<00:02:25.489> out<00:02:25.640> some<00:02:26.090> detail<00:02:26.480> in<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:27.080> branch

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
help bring out some detail in the branch

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.170 
help bring out some detail in the branch
here<00:02:27.560> so<00:02:27.800> now<00:02:27.890> if<00:02:27.950> we<00:02:28.069> just<00:02:28.099> reset<00:02:28.760> that<00:02:28.790> you

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
here so now if we just reset that you

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.270 
here so now if we just reset that you
can<00:02:29.330> see<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.660> difference<00:02:30.080> already<00:02:30.410> is<00:02:30.590> quite

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
can see the difference already is quite

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.880 
can see the difference already is quite
significant<00:02:31.940> and<00:02:32.060> we<00:02:32.840> still<00:02:33.110> got<00:02:33.290> a<00:02:33.560> lot<00:02:33.769> of

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
significant and we still got a lot of

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.320 
significant and we still got a lot of
options<00:02:34.069> to<00:02:34.370> go<00:02:34.489> over<00:02:34.670> okay<00:02:34.940> so<00:02:35.000> I'm<00:02:35.120> going<00:02:35.269> to

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
options to go over okay so I'm going to

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.150 
options to go over okay so I'm going to
bring<00:02:35.480> up<00:02:35.599> contrast<00:02:36.110> a<00:02:36.260> little<00:02:36.290> bit<00:02:36.830> more<00:02:37.010> and

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
bring up contrast a little bit more and

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.680 
bring up contrast a little bit more and
maybe<00:02:37.340> bring<00:02:37.549> the<00:02:37.700> brightness<00:02:37.910> down<00:02:38.239> sorry

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
maybe bring the brightness down sorry

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.539 
maybe bring the brightness down sorry
but<00:02:39.049> that's<00:02:39.650> looking<00:02:39.950> pretty<00:02:40.099> good<00:02:40.220> now<00:02:40.280> and

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
but that's looking pretty good now and

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.369 
but that's looking pretty good now and
the<00:02:40.819> next<00:02:41.030> one<00:02:41.150> down<00:02:41.269> is<00:02:41.330> clarity<00:02:42.019> now<00:02:42.230> what

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
the next one down is clarity now what

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:43.990 
the next one down is clarity now what
clarity<00:02:42.739> does<00:02:42.830> is<00:02:43.099> it<00:02:43.220> pretty<00:02:43.340> much<00:02:43.519> helps<00:02:43.849> to

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
clarity does is it pretty much helps to

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000 
clarity does is it pretty much helps to
find<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.299> edges<00:02:44.599> of<00:02:44.870> your<00:02:44.900> photo<00:02:45.440> now<00:02:45.709> just<00:02:45.920> be

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
find the edges of your photo now just be

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.199 
find the edges of your photo now just be
careful<00:02:46.129> you<00:02:46.310> don't<00:02:46.340> go<00:02:46.549> overboard<00:02:46.790> you<00:02:47.000> can

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
careful you don't go overboard you can

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.520 
careful you don't go overboard you can
see<00:02:47.360> if<00:02:47.450> we<00:02:47.510> bring<00:02:47.750> this<00:02:47.930> up<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.349> background

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
see if we bring this up the background

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.860 
see if we bring this up the background
here<00:02:48.950> gets<00:02:49.250> quite<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.819> bad<00:02:50.060> black<00:02:50.390> haloing

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
here gets quite a bad black haloing

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.120 
here gets quite a bad black haloing
effect<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.500> some<00:02:51.709> of<00:02:51.769> the<00:02:51.860> out-of-focus

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
effect and some of the out-of-focus

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.729 
effect and some of the out-of-focus
parts<00:02:52.700> here<00:02:52.940> just<00:02:53.239> don't<00:02:53.420> look<00:02:53.630> as<00:02:53.810> nice<00:02:54.049> so

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
parts here just don't look as nice so

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.740 
parts here just don't look as nice so
you<00:02:54.799> either<00:02:55.099> better<00:02:55.430> off<00:02:55.670> using<00:02:55.970> it<00:02:56.239> to<00:02:56.480> very

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
you either better off using it to very

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.470 
you either better off using it to very
slight<00:02:57.110> amounts<00:02:57.530> so<00:02:57.769> plus<00:02:58.069> 30<00:02:58.400> or<00:02:58.579> so<00:02:58.760> just<00:02:59.360> to

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
slight amounts so plus 30 or so just to

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.030 
slight amounts so plus 30 or so just to
help<00:02:59.630> bring<00:02:59.840> out<00:02:59.959> the<00:03:00.079> branch<00:03:00.319> or<00:03:00.620> you<00:03:00.739> can<00:03:00.890> use

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
help bring out the branch or you can use

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.309 
help bring out the branch or you can use
the<00:03:01.190> adjustment<00:03:01.640> brush<00:03:01.760> tool<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.360> just<00:03:03.200> go

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
the adjustment brush tool and just go

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.680 
the adjustment brush tool and just go
over<00:03:03.349> the<00:03:03.560> branch<00:03:03.799> itself<00:03:04.220> and<00:03:04.670> miss<00:03:05.390> all<00:03:05.660> of

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
over the branch itself and miss all of

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.770 
over the branch itself and miss all of
the<00:03:05.870> out-of-focus<00:03:06.799> parts<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.489> that's<00:03:08.329> one

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
the out-of-focus parts and that's one

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.930 
the out-of-focus parts and that's one
way<00:03:08.959> that<00:03:09.170> I<00:03:09.349> tend<00:03:09.709> to<00:03:09.799> do<00:03:09.950> things<00:03:10.220> quite<00:03:10.670> a<00:03:10.760> bit

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
way that I tend to do things quite a bit

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.490 
way that I tend to do things quite a bit
okay<00:03:11.329> so<00:03:11.390> now<00:03:11.599> down<00:03:11.780> to<00:03:11.900> vibrance<00:03:12.319> and

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
okay so now down to vibrance and

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.080 
okay so now down to vibrance and
saturation<00:03:12.590> I'm<00:03:13.489> going<00:03:13.610> to<00:03:13.670> just<00:03:13.790> bring<00:03:14.000> up

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
saturation I'm going to just bring up

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.400 
saturation I'm going to just bring up
the<00:03:14.120> parents<00:03:14.599> a<00:03:14.629> little<00:03:14.690> bit<00:03:14.930> to<00:03:15.079> help<00:03:15.170> bring

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
the parents a little bit to help bring

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.050 
the parents a little bit to help bring
out<00:03:15.530> those<00:03:15.680> colors<00:03:15.920> and<00:03:16.370> leave<00:03:16.910> the

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
out those colors and leave the

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.150 
out those colors and leave the
saturation<00:03:17.510> at<00:03:17.840> zero<00:03:18.110> and<00:03:18.349> then<00:03:18.829> what<00:03:18.950> tone

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
saturation at zero and then what tone

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.979 
saturation at zero and then what tone
curves<00:03:19.400> is<00:03:19.579> pretty<00:03:20.090> much<00:03:20.269> you<00:03:20.450> can<00:03:20.569> adjust<00:03:20.900> the

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
curves is pretty much you can adjust the

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.050 
curves is pretty much you can adjust the
highlights<00:03:21.379> light<00:03:21.799> stalks<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:22.430> shadows<00:03:22.790> all

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
highlights light stalks and shadows all

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.330 
highlights light stalks and shadows all
individually<00:03:23.750> along<00:03:24.109> this<00:03:24.319> tone<00:03:24.829> curve<00:03:25.069> line

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
individually along this tone curve line

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.160 
individually along this tone curve line
or<00:03:25.639> you<00:03:25.730> can<00:03:25.850> just<00:03:26.000> select<00:03:26.120> a<00:03:26.299> preset<00:03:26.810> I

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
or you can just select a preset I

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.410 
or you can just select a preset I
usually<00:03:27.859> leave<00:03:28.040> it<00:03:28.069> at<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.519> default<00:03:28.670> medium

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
usually leave it at the default medium

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.360 
usually leave it at the default medium
or<00:03:29.600> in<00:03:29.989> some<00:03:30.230> cases<00:03:30.470> depending<00:03:30.859> on<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.160> photo

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
or in some cases depending on the photo

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.340 
or in some cases depending on the photo
I<00:03:31.430> might<00:03:31.639> adjust<00:03:31.970> some<00:03:32.299> slightly<00:03:32.840> but<00:03:33.019> for<00:03:33.260> now

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
I might adjust some slightly but for now

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.240 
I might adjust some slightly but for now
that's<00:03:33.590> looking<00:03:33.709> pretty<00:03:33.859> good

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
that's looking pretty good

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.160 
that's looking pretty good
now<00:03:34.489> what<00:03:34.639> hue<00:03:34.880> saturation<00:03:35.090> and<00:03:35.510> luminance<00:03:35.660> do

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
now what hue saturation and luminance do

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.229 
now what hue saturation and luminance do
is<00:03:36.440> pretty<00:03:37.280> much<00:03:37.430> self-explanatory<00:03:37.760> however

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
is pretty much self-explanatory however

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.120 
is pretty much self-explanatory however
a<00:03:38.569> cool<00:03:38.810> feature<00:03:38.989> in<00:03:39.200> Lightroom<00:03:39.560> is<00:03:39.799> these

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
a cool feature in Lightroom is these

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.680 
a cool feature in Lightroom is these
adjustment<00:03:40.700> sliders<00:03:41.000> here<00:03:41.209> and<00:03:41.420> now<00:03:41.569> I'll

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
adjustment sliders here and now I'll

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.360 
adjustment sliders here and now I'll
demonstrate<00:03:41.810> this<00:03:42.349> on<00:03:42.620> a<00:03:42.650> different<00:03:43.160> photo

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
demonstrate this on a different photo

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.250 
demonstrate this on a different photo
for<00:03:43.639> you<00:03:43.760> so<00:03:43.970> if<00:03:44.030> we<00:03:44.150> go<00:03:44.269> to<00:03:44.299> here<00:03:44.599> and<00:03:44.900> we<00:03:45.230> just

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
for you so if we go to here and we just

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.170 
for you so if we go to here and we just
reset<00:03:45.920> this<00:03:46.099> we<00:03:46.370> can<00:03:46.489> see<00:03:46.639> if<00:03:46.700> we<00:03:46.760> go<00:03:46.940> down<00:03:47.120> to

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
reset this we can see if we go down to

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.890 
reset this we can see if we go down to
here<00:03:47.630> and<00:03:47.980> we<00:03:48.980> go<00:03:49.639> to<00:03:49.700> the<00:03:49.910> luminance<00:03:50.239> tab<00:03:50.569> and

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
here and we go to the luminance tab and

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.490 
here and we go to the luminance tab and
select<00:03:51.500> this<00:03:51.680> slider<00:03:52.069> what<00:03:52.790> it<00:03:52.940> does<00:03:53.150> is<00:03:53.720> lets

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
select this slider what it does is lets

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.319 
select this slider what it does is lets
you<00:03:54.620> select<00:03:54.859> any<00:03:55.130> color<00:03:55.459> slide<00:03:55.819> up<00:03:56.030> or<00:03:56.150> down

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
you select any color slide up or down

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:57.909 
you select any color slide up or down
and<00:03:56.630> Lightroom<00:03:56.930> or<00:03:57.019> automatically<00:03:57.650> adjust

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:57.919 
and Lightroom or automatically adjust

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.140 
and Lightroom or automatically adjust
the<00:03:57.980> sliders<00:03:58.400> that<00:03:58.430> correspond<00:03:58.940> to<00:03:58.970> those

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
the sliders that correspond to those

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.120 
the sliders that correspond to those
colors<00:03:59.480> so<00:04:00.169> you'll<00:04:00.290> see<00:04:00.410> if<00:04:00.470> we<00:04:00.590> click<00:04:00.739> on<00:04:00.859> the

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
colors so you'll see if we click on the

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.059 
colors so you'll see if we click on the
blue<00:04:01.310> sky<00:04:01.579> here<00:04:01.760> and<00:04:01.910> drag<00:04:02.120> it<00:04:02.269> down<00:04:02.590> it<00:04:03.590> pretty

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
blue sky here and drag it down it pretty

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:05.770 
blue sky here and drag it down it pretty
much<00:04:04.220> just<00:04:04.280> adjusts<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:05.030> blue<00:04:05.209> but<00:04:05.450> slightly

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
much just adjusts the blue but slightly

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.940 
much just adjusts the blue but slightly
green<00:04:06.200> and<00:04:06.609> same<00:04:07.609> at<00:04:07.730> saturation<00:04:08.239> and<00:04:08.950> that's

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
green and same at saturation and that's

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.470 
green and same at saturation and that's
just<00:04:10.130> a<00:04:10.220> cool<00:04:10.430> way<00:04:10.549> to<00:04:10.579> really<00:04:10.940> help<00:04:11.030> enhance

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
just a cool way to really help enhance

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.509 
just a cool way to really help enhance
the<00:04:11.780> skies<00:04:12.049> or<00:04:12.500> anything<00:04:12.829> in<00:04:13.069> your<00:04:13.190> photos

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
the skies or anything in your photos

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.520 
the skies or anything in your photos
without<00:04:13.810> individually<00:04:14.810> playing<00:04:15.079> around<00:04:15.349> with

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
without individually playing around with

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.949 
without individually playing around with
sliders<00:04:16.180> so<00:04:17.180> yeah<00:04:17.359> I<00:04:17.570> just<00:04:17.599> thought<00:04:17.840> I'd

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
sliders so yeah I just thought I'd

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.360 
sliders so yeah I just thought I'd
demonstrate<00:04:18.109> it<00:04:18.530> on<00:04:18.590> an<00:04:18.769> image<00:04:19.070> where<00:04:19.250> you'd

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
demonstrate it on an image where you'd

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.890 
demonstrate it on an image where you'd
actually<00:04:19.459> be<00:04:19.700> able<00:04:19.880> to<00:04:20.030> see<00:04:20.180> it<00:04:20.269> so<00:04:20.720> back<00:04:20.870> to

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
actually be able to see it so back to

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.770 
actually be able to see it so back to
this<00:04:21.109> one<00:04:21.320> and<00:04:21.760> moving<00:04:22.760> down<00:04:22.970> to<00:04:23.180> split<00:04:23.539> toning

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
this one and moving down to split toning

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.900 
this one and moving down to split toning
and<00:04:24.050> again<00:04:24.860> I'll<00:04:24.950> have<00:04:25.070> to<00:04:25.190> swap<00:04:25.400> em<00:04:25.580> just<00:04:25.789> for

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
and again I'll have to swap em just for

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.300 
and again I'll have to swap em just for
this<00:04:26.000> one<00:04:26.210> sorry<00:04:26.479> but<00:04:26.750> you<00:04:27.710> can<00:04:27.830> see<00:04:27.979> I<00:04:28.010> used

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
this one sorry but you can see I used

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.339 
this one sorry but you can see I used
split<00:04:28.849> toning<00:04:29.150> in<00:04:29.539> this<00:04:29.719> image<00:04:30.020> to<00:04:30.140> create

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:30.349 
split toning in this image to create

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:35.529 
split toning in this image to create
that<00:04:30.560> nice<00:04:30.800> soft<00:04:31.840> pink<00:04:32.840> effect<00:04:33.409> if<00:04:34.060> we<00:04:35.060> reset

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
that nice soft pink effect if we reset

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:37.270 
that nice soft pink effect if we reset
that<00:04:35.719> you<00:04:35.810> can<00:04:35.960> see<00:04:36.110> it's<00:04:36.260> got<00:04:36.469> no<00:04:36.620> pink<00:04:37.010> and

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
that you can see it's got no pink and

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.029 
that you can see it's got no pink and
this<00:04:37.640> one<00:04:37.849> is<00:04:38.659> a<00:04:38.719> bit<00:04:38.930> softer<00:04:39.380> has<00:04:39.620> that<00:04:39.860> nice

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 
this one is a bit softer has that nice

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.339 
this one is a bit softer has that nice
glowing<00:04:40.460> about<00:04:40.849> it<00:04:41.000> and<00:04:41.210> that's<00:04:41.990> what<00:04:42.140> you<00:04:42.229> can

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:42.349 
glowing about it and that's what you can

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:43.600 
glowing about it and that's what you can
do<00:04:42.409> it<00:04:42.530> split<00:04:42.770> toning<00:04:42.950> create<00:04:43.310> some<00:04:43.490> nice

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
do it split toning create some nice

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.130 
do it split toning create some nice
tones<00:04:43.909> within<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:44.270> images<00:04:44.690> and<00:04:44.930> it<00:04:44.990> also

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
tones within the images and it also

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.779 
tones within the images and it also
works<00:04:45.440> really<00:04:45.650> well<00:04:45.919> on<00:04:45.979> black<00:04:46.490> and<00:04:46.669> white

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
works really well on black and white

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.330 
works really well on black and white
photos<00:04:47.289> such<00:04:48.289> as<00:04:48.440> this<00:04:48.590> one<00:04:48.800> with<00:04:48.979> a<00:04:49.010> bit<00:04:49.219> of

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
photos such as this one with a bit of

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.850 
photos such as this one with a bit of
brown<00:04:50.330> split<00:04:50.630> tone<00:04:50.810> but<00:04:51.080> that's<00:04:51.500> a<00:04:51.590> horrible

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
brown split tone but that's a horrible

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.589 
brown split tone but that's a horrible
image<00:04:52.070> in<00:04:52.310> my<00:04:52.430> opinion<00:04:52.789> so<00:04:53.000> just<00:04:53.510> a

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:53.599 
image in my opinion so just a

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:55.390 
image in my opinion so just a
demonstration<00:04:53.780> okay<00:04:54.409> so<00:04:54.620> that's<00:04:54.860> pretty<00:04:55.310> much

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
demonstration okay so that's pretty much

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.550 
demonstration okay so that's pretty much
it<00:04:55.580> for<00:04:55.700> that<00:04:55.849> and<00:04:56.060> moving<00:04:56.539> down<00:04:56.719> to<00:04:56.990> detail

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
it for that and moving down to detail

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.200 
it for that and moving down to detail
okay<00:04:58.130> so<00:04:58.190> this<00:04:58.370> box<00:04:58.580> here<00:04:58.700> is<00:04:58.820> pretty<00:04:59.030> much<00:04:59.150> a

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
okay so this box here is pretty much a

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.630 
okay so this box here is pretty much a
magnified<00:04:59.719> view<00:04:59.990> of<00:05:00.050> your<00:05:00.469> photo<00:05:00.830> and<00:05:01.130> it

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
magnified view of your photo and it

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.360 
magnified view of your photo and it
allows<00:05:02.000> you<00:05:02.270> to<00:05:02.570> monitor<00:05:03.260> your<00:05:03.500> sharpness<00:05:04.070> and

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
allows you to monitor your sharpness and

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.790 
allows you to monitor your sharpness and
noise<00:05:05.150> levels<00:05:05.539> I<00:05:05.690> guess<00:05:05.870> and<00:05:06.140> you<00:05:06.560> can<00:05:06.680> see

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
noise levels I guess and you can see

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.260 
noise levels I guess and you can see
there's<00:05:06.979> a<00:05:07.099> little<00:05:07.460> bit<00:05:07.550> of<00:05:07.729> noise<00:05:07.820> here<00:05:08.150> you

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
there's a little bit of noise here you

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.250 
there's a little bit of noise here you
might<00:05:08.419> not<00:05:08.570> be<00:05:08.690> able<00:05:08.810> to<00:05:08.870> see<00:05:09.080> it<00:05:09.169> on<00:05:09.200> the

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
might not be able to see it on the

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.750 
might not be able to see it on the
screen<00:05:09.500> recorder<00:05:10.010> but<00:05:10.130> since<00:05:10.550> there's<00:05:10.729> a

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
screen recorder but since there's a

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.159 
screen recorder but since there's a
readi<00:05:10.940> noise<00:05:11.120> without<00:05:11.360> me<00:05:11.630> playing<00:05:11.870> about<00:05:12.050> the

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
readi noise without me playing about the

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.600 
readi noise without me playing about the
sharpness<00:05:12.469> I'm<00:05:12.680> just<00:05:12.830> going<00:05:12.950> to<00:05:12.979> probably<00:05:13.190> add

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
sharpness I'm just going to probably add

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.339 
sharpness I'm just going to probably add
a<00:05:13.640> little<00:05:14.150> bit<00:05:14.300> of<00:05:14.390> luminance<00:05:14.780> in<00:05:14.960> to<00:05:15.140> help

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:15.349 
a little bit of luminance in to help

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:17.110 
a little bit of luminance in to help
hide<00:05:15.590> that<00:05:15.830> and<00:05:16.070> that's<00:05:16.460> looking<00:05:16.789> pretty<00:05:16.820> good

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
hide that and that's looking pretty good

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.480 
hide that and that's looking pretty good
there<00:05:17.390> okay<00:05:17.810> now<00:05:17.960> down<00:05:18.169> to<00:05:18.469> lens<00:05:18.860> Corrections

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
there okay now down to lens Corrections

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.310 
there okay now down to lens Corrections
you<00:05:19.610> can<00:05:19.820> either<00:05:20.000> set<00:05:20.300> this<00:05:20.419> to<00:05:20.599> profile<00:05:21.080> and

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
you can either set this to profile and

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.959 
you can either set this to profile and
it'll<00:05:21.500> automatically<00:05:21.950> detect<00:05:22.430> your<00:05:22.520> lens<00:05:22.760> or

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:22.969 
it'll automatically detect your lens or

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:24.909 
it'll automatically detect your lens or
you<00:05:23.060> can<00:05:23.210> select<00:05:23.390> it<00:05:23.690> so<00:05:24.229> I've<00:05:24.289> got<00:05:24.469> my<00:05:24.620> right

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
you can select it so I've got my right

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.580 
you can select it so I've got my right
which<00:05:25.460> it<00:05:25.669> says<00:05:25.880> I<00:05:26.000> used<00:05:26.240> a<00:05:26.360> Canon<00:05:26.690> 16<00:05:27.050> to<00:05:27.169> 35

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
which it says I used a Canon 16 to 35

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.250 
which it says I used a Canon 16 to 35
lens<00:05:28.130> and<00:05:28.460> it'll<00:05:29.300> automatically<00:05:29.870> try<00:05:30.169> and

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
lens and it'll automatically try and

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.350 
lens and it'll automatically try and
correct<00:05:30.530> the<00:05:31.099> distortion<00:05:31.729> and<00:05:32.060> the<00:05:32.210> been

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
correct the distortion and the been

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.600 
correct the distortion and the been
getting<00:05:32.690> from<00:05:32.960> that<00:05:33.200> lens<00:05:33.440> we<00:05:34.099> can<00:05:34.190> do<00:05:34.400> it<00:05:34.490> all

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
getting from that lens we can do it all

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.330 
getting from that lens we can do it all
manually<00:05:34.969> and<00:05:35.330> I<00:05:35.930> prefer<00:05:36.409> this<00:05:36.590> way<00:05:36.800> since<00:05:37.130> I

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
manually and I prefer this way since I

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.940 
manually and I prefer this way since I
usually<00:05:37.520> like<00:05:37.880> to<00:05:38.120> add<00:05:38.330> in<00:05:38.599> a<00:05:38.690> nice<00:05:38.950> vignette

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
usually like to add in a nice vignette

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.880 
usually like to add in a nice vignette
from<00:05:40.159> the<00:05:40.880> lens<00:05:41.060> Corrections<00:05:41.599> and<00:05:41.810> yes<00:05:42.680> there

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:42.890 
from the lens Corrections and yes there

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:44.589 
from the lens Corrections and yes there
is<00:05:43.010> another<00:05:43.280> vignette<00:05:43.700> option<00:05:44.030> down<00:05:44.180> here<00:05:44.419> but

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:44.599 
is another vignette option down here but

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:46.420 
is another vignette option down here but
I<00:05:44.630> prefer<00:05:44.990> that<00:05:45.139> one<00:05:45.200> I<00:05:45.349> think<00:05:45.680> it<00:05:45.800> gives<00:05:45.919> more

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
I prefer that one I think it gives more

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.100 
I prefer that one I think it gives more
of<00:05:46.490> a<00:05:46.639> subtle<00:05:46.849> and<00:05:47.120> soft<00:05:47.330> effect<00:05:47.690> but<00:05:47.930> that's

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
of a subtle and soft effect but that's

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.870 
of a subtle and soft effect but that's
just<00:05:48.229> my<00:05:48.409> personal<00:05:48.800> opinion<00:05:48.889> and<00:05:49.550> mine

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
just my personal opinion and mine

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.940 
just my personal opinion and mine
appeals<00:05:50.330> as<00:05:50.510> well<00:05:50.750> okay<00:05:51.289> so<00:05:51.320> there<00:05:51.590> we<00:05:51.620> go<00:05:51.800> if

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:51.950 
appeals as well okay so there we go if

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.129 
appeals as well okay so there we go if
we<00:05:52.010> reset<00:05:52.669> this<00:05:52.820> we<00:05:52.969> can<00:05:53.120> see<00:05:53.419> the<00:05:53.630> difference

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:54.139 
we reset this we can see the difference

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:57.430 
we reset this we can see the difference
is<00:05:54.550> quite<00:05:55.550> dramatic<00:05:56.150> and<00:05:56.539> I<00:05:56.780> hope<00:05:56.960> this<00:05:57.139> helped

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
is quite dramatic and I hope this helped
