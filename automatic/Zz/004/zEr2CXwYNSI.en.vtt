00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
the major complaint you see with these

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.830 
the major complaint you see with these
is<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.670> heads<00:00:41.910> come<00:00:42.120> loose<00:00:42.300> after<00:00:42.510> like

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
is that the heads come loose after like

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.229 
is that the heads come loose after like
five<00:00:43.079> minutes<00:00:43.320> well

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
five minutes well

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.369 
five minutes well
tomahawks<00:00:45.239> weren't<00:00:45.510> meant<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.870> have<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.050> set

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
tomahawks weren't meant to have a set

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.020 
tomahawks weren't meant to have a set
screw<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.710> them<00:00:46.860> they're<00:00:47.070> meant<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.520> have<00:00:47.730> a

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
screw in them they're meant to have a

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.319 
screw in them they're meant to have a
friction<00:00:48.930> fit<00:00:49.200> on<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.920> handle<00:00:50.309> by<00:00:50.910> having<00:00:51.210> a

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
friction fit on the handle by having a

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.740 
friction fit on the handle by having a
kind<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.350> bulging<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.309> now<00:00:54.030> even<00:00:54.480> create<00:00:54.719> a

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
kind of a bulging and now even create a

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.970 
kind of a bulging and now even create a
friction<00:00:55.649> fit<00:00:55.829> with<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:57.320> when<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.410> have<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.649> set

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
friction fit with so when you have a set

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.709 
friction fit with so when you have a set
screw<00:00:59.660> that<00:01:01.039> keeps<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.280> head<00:01:02.489> as<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:03.090> swing

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
screw that keeps the head as you swing

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.289 
screw that keeps the head as you swing
this<00:01:04.189> Center<00:01:05.189> grow<00:01:05.369> Forrest<00:01:05.820> centrifugal

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
this Center grow Forrest centrifugal

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.210 
this Center grow Forrest centrifugal
force<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.869> going<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.080> push<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.439> upwards<00:01:07.619> and

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
force is going to push it upwards and

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.250 
force is going to push it upwards and
off<00:01:08.729> like<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.240> wants<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.689> fly<00:01:09.900> off<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.110> handle

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
off like it wants to fly off the handle

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.830 
off like it wants to fly off the handle
but<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.400> bulge<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.939> going<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.180> stop<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.659> and

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
but that bulge is going to stop it and

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.320 
but that bulge is going to stop it and
that<00:01:13.350> force<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.860> gonna<00:01:13.979> create<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.820> friction

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
that force is gonna create a friction

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.840 
that force is gonna create a friction
fit<00:01:15.570> upwards<00:01:16.080> if<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.890> have<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.369> stupid

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
fit upwards if you have this stupid

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.719 
fit upwards if you have this stupid
little<00:01:18.000> set<00:01:18.270> screw<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.689> there<00:01:19.520> you're<00:01:20.520> not

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
little set screw in there you're not

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.690 
little set screw in there you're not
gonna<00:01:20.880> get<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.360> it's<00:01:22.229> gonna<00:01:22.350> stay<00:01:22.590> put<00:01:22.890> and

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
gonna get that it's gonna stay put and

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.880 
gonna get that it's gonna stay put and
it's<00:01:24.180> never<00:01:24.390> gonna<00:01:24.540> squeeze<00:01:25.049> its<00:01:25.290> way<00:01:25.439> up<00:01:25.650> and

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
it's never gonna squeeze its way up and

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.620 
it's never gonna squeeze its way up and
get<00:01:26.009> tighter<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.790> handle<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.270> you

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
get tighter on to the handle so you

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.330 
get tighter on to the handle so you
really<00:01:27.840> need<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.049> take<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.650> set<00:01:28.920> screw<00:01:29.040> out

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
really need to take that set screw out

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.969 
really need to take that set screw out
so<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.210> thing<00:01:30.270> can<00:01:30.799> adjust<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
so that this thing can adjust to the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.319 
so that this thing can adjust to the
handle<00:01:32.189> because<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.520> know<00:01:32.610> let's<00:01:32.759> face<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:32.970> if

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
handle because you know let's face it if

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.660 
handle because you know let's face it if
you're<00:01:33.810> in<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.960> really<00:01:34.170> dry<00:01:34.409> climate<00:01:35.040> or<00:01:35.280> you

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
you're in a really dry climate or you

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.620 
you're in a really dry climate or you
know<00:01:35.759> maybe<00:01:35.939> someplace<00:01:36.299> with<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.479> lot<00:01:36.509> of

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
know maybe someplace with a lot of

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.840 
know maybe someplace with a lot of
moisture<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:37.409> handle<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:37.950> gonna<00:01:38.100> shrink<00:01:38.490> or

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
moisture this handle is gonna shrink or

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.249 
moisture this handle is gonna shrink or
maybe<00:01:39.380> expand<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.250> want<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:42.110> handle<00:01:43.110> to

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
maybe expand so you want this handle to

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.350 
maybe expand so you want this handle to
be<00:01:43.290> able<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.799> want<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.009> do<00:01:44.130> your<00:01:44.360> tomahawk

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
be able to you want to do your tomahawk

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.539 
be able to you want to do your tomahawk
had<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.810> be<00:01:45.930> able<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.200> kind<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.439> move<00:01:47.220> and

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
had to be able to kind of move and

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.399 
had to be able to kind of move and
breathe<00:01:47.759> with<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.540> take<00:01:48.630> off<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.200> set

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
breathe with it so you take off that set

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.499 
breathe with it so you take off that set
screw<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.710> don't<00:01:49.890> need<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.390> you<00:01:51.390> know

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
screw you don't need it you know

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.300 
screw you don't need it you know
