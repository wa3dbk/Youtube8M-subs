00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
to do with starting the server so you

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.069 
to do with starting the server so you
can<00:01:49.200> call<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.500> starter<00:01:49.950> anything<00:01:50.780> so<00:01:51.780> just

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
can call it starter anything so just

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.600 
can call it starter anything so just
call<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.350> server<00:01:52.619> starter<00:01:53.100> now<00:01:53.340> what<00:01:53.520> you

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
call that server starter now what you

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.920 
call that server starter now what you
want<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.790> do<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.060> want<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.270> open<00:01:54.329> this<00:01:54.720> with

notepad so go ahead and open that now
there<00:01:57.450> will<00:01:57.600> be<00:01:57.659> some<00:01:58.500> codes<00:01:59.189> in<00:01:59.399> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
there will be some codes in the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.969 
there will be some codes in the
description<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.869> depends<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:01.469> if<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.740> have<00:02:01.950> a

description it depends on if you have a

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.569 
description it depends on if you have a
32-bit<00:02:02.759> system<00:02:02.969> or<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.479> 64-bit<00:02:03.810> system<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.340> I

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
32-bit system or a 64-bit system so I

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.180 
32-bit system or a 64-bit system so I
have<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.060> 64-bit<00:02:06.840> system<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.409> copied<00:02:08.009> that

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
have the 64-bit system so I copied that

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.550 
have the 64-bit system so I copied that
code<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.759> I'm<00:02:08.879> gonna<00:02:09.000> paste<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.539> in<00:02:09.660> here<00:02:09.690> so

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
code and I'm gonna paste it in here so

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.650 
code and I'm gonna paste it in here so
I<00:02:11.620> so<00:02:12.489> what<00:02:12.610> you<00:02:12.730> need<00:02:12.849> to<00:02:12.910> do<00:02:13.090> is<00:02:13.270> open<00:02:13.540> up<00:02:13.599> the

what you want it to do
and<00:02:58.780> then<00:02:58.930> it'll<00:02:59.080> start<00:02:59.470> to<00:02:59.500> prepare<00:02:59.830> the

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
and then it'll start to prepare the

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.240 
and then it'll start to prepare the
spawn<00:03:00.400> area<00:03:01.380> so<00:03:02.380> once<00:03:02.530> it<00:03:02.650> gets<00:03:02.739> to<00:03:02.860> a<00:03:02.950> hundred

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
spawn area so once it gets to a hundred

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:19.710 
spawn area so once it gets to a hundred
percent<00:03:03.340> we'll<00:03:03.819> stop<00:03:04.660> it

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.960 

all<00:03:20.720> right<00:03:20.990> now<00:03:21.350> that<00:03:21.380> it<00:03:21.890> is<00:03:22.130> done<00:03:22.460> you<00:03:22.670> can<00:03:22.820> go

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
all right now that it is done you can go

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.140 
all right now that it is done you can go
ahead<00:03:23.000> and<00:03:23.530> type<00:03:24.530> in<00:03:24.740> stop<00:03:25.190> then<00:03:25.760> hit<00:03:26.000> enter

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
ahead and type in stop then hit enter

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.290 
ahead and type in stop then hit enter
it'll<00:03:26.780> say<00:03:27.230> stopping<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.770> server<00:03:28.040> and<00:03:28.300> saving

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
it'll say stopping the server and saving

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.780 
it'll say stopping the server and saving
chunks<00:03:29.720> and<00:03:29.950> eventually<00:03:30.950> it'll<00:03:31.130> close<00:03:31.430> on<00:03:31.640> its

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
chunks and eventually it'll close on its

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.010 
chunks and eventually it'll close on its
own<00:03:32.830> that<00:03:33.830> the<00:03:34.640> preparing<00:03:35.060> spawn<00:03:35.330> area<00:03:35.690> the

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
own that the preparing spawn area the

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.660 
own that the preparing spawn area the
first<00:03:36.260> time<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:36.590> do<00:03:36.710> it<00:03:36.740> will<00:03:37.100> probably<00:03:37.310> take

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
first time you do it will probably take

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.510 
first time you do it will probably take
a<00:03:37.700> little<00:03:38.030> bit<00:03:38.150> and<00:03:38.330> the<00:03:39.140> second<00:03:39.470> times<00:03:39.650> the

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
a little bit and the second times the

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.090 
a little bit and the second times the
more<00:03:40.670> times<00:03:40.910> you<00:03:41.000> do<00:03:41.120> it<00:03:41.270> it'll<00:03:41.420> get<00:03:41.660> faster<00:03:42.590> so

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
more times you do it it'll get faster so

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.610 
more times you do it it'll get faster so
now<00:03:43.340> what<00:03:43.490> you<00:03:43.670> realize<00:03:44.120> now<00:03:44.480> that<00:03:44.510> it<00:03:45.350> just

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
now what you realize now that it just

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.020 
now what you realize now that it just
created<00:03:45.950> a<00:03:46.070> bunch<00:03:46.250> of<00:03:46.400> stuff<00:03:46.640> in<00:03:46.790> your<00:03:46.820> new

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
created a bunch of stuff in your new

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.350 
created a bunch of stuff in your new
