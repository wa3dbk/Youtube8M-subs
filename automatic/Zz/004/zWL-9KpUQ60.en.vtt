00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:21.259
 the river system succeeded the Japanese these 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:26.480
 Russian simple sticks cured not one 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:28.099
 a hundred people among my patients who 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.700
 thus restored themselves 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:34.480
 completely spine we put 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.480
 centimeter distance 3 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.060
 cover with a towel for softness 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:44.420
 sticks are from any drawer and you can 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:48.350
 take very hard to overestimate this 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.690
 tool he really saves people from 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.910
 disability from pain and depth should 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.920
 at least be the same centimeter yourself 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.260
 here's 20 half here a little more 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.079
 no longer interferes with less than 2 so what 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.899
 the spine did not reach the floor 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:08.990
 cover with a towel and so this 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:09.829
 works after which the spine 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:17.060
 fits between 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:21.560
 and so i can in this way strengthen 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:24.590
 pressure on the joints of the artist but not 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.840
 injure vertebral bodies, spinous 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.939
 spikes 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.009
 if at some point it feels dressed in 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.600
 discomfort pain here we find this 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:37.100
 specific point twist back 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.439
 we stretch and at this point we do 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.999
 additionally rocking on one plus 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.999
 minus yourself from a couple of centimeters 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.539
 piece of log 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:58.810
 who has propylene to a depth of 2 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.729
 centimeter such a notch as you 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:05.469
 guess too we will quickly 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:07.990
 we will put the spine and towels 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:10.780
 the size of the logs have not really any 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.830
 values ​​ie form can be 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:18.220
 round can be any good of it 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:30.299
 extraordinary but I highly recommend it 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:45.370
 this rolls the whole back loose 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:46.170
 rober blocks and loins very well 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.290
 . 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.290
 click on three pieces are dangerous 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:12.890
 essentially these two things are batteries 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:14.810
 Do you recognize this Kazan replace the session 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.239
 good chiropractor if you 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:22.840
 feel your body 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:26.840
 here but these exercises are sticks with a log 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.640
 it is they very powerful impact if you 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.250
 unsure of yourself first surely better 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.590
 Nalchik go to look 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.079
 because a person can get scared if 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:40.780
 suddenly blocks are revealed in this way 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:42.709
 Here is a picture of the spine from the side behind 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.870
 the spine is arranged like this 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.239
 called spinous processes if we 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.060
 we will just give tension to them on 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.769
 mat on the floor that find shoots coming 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.129
 very strong load is painful 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:57.200
 can transform them to give 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:59.599
 powerful load we here sets these 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.909
 sticks and this is a log with kerfs 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.859
 so the spine gets its 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:06.970
 load without any risk 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:06.970
 bone damage
