00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
different food ok as you can see I get

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.349 
different food ok as you can see I get
70<00:03:36.209> popularity<00:03:36.870> from<00:03:37.049> from<00:03:37.950> food<00:03:38.220> and<00:03:38.430> I

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
70 popularity from from food and I

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:46.280 
70 popularity from from food and I
produce<00:03:40.140> a<00:03:40.440> lot<00:03:41.000> but<00:03:42.000> I<00:03:42.060> have<00:03:44.510> well<00:03:45.510> you<00:03:46.109> need

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
produce a lot but I have well you need

peasants<00:03:53.730> also<00:03:54.239> you<00:03:54.299> have<00:03:54.660> to<00:03:54.690> research<00:03:55.200> the

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
peasants also you have to research the

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.259 
peasants also you have to research the
full<00:03:55.680> productivity<00:03:56.489> because<00:03:57.530> two<00:03:58.530> buildings

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
full productivity because two buildings

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.460 
full productivity because two buildings
won't<00:04:00.269> be<00:04:00.750> able<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:01.459> to<00:04:02.459> produce<00:04:03.150> off<00:04:03.720> if<00:04:04.260> you

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
won't be able to to produce off if you

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.490 
won't be able to to produce off if you
don't<00:04:04.910> research<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.209> productivity<00:04:07.019> so<00:04:07.319> it's

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
don't research the productivity so it's

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.340 
don't research the productivity so it's
good<00:04:07.680> to<00:04:07.709> research<00:04:08.069> the<00:04:08.220> productivity<00:04:09.000> and

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
good to research the productivity and

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.620 
good to research the productivity and
let<00:04:10.350> only<00:04:10.650> two<00:04:10.980> peasants<00:04:11.250> work

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
let only two peasants work

for type of food then if you need the
more<00:04:17.760> stone<00:04:18.060> than<00:04:18.480> would<00:04:18.750> turn<00:04:19.440> off<00:04:19.680> the<00:04:19.860> wood

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
more stone than would turn off the wood
