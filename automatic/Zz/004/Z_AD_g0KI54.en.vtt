00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
takes a couple practice sessions to get

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.950 
takes a couple practice sessions to get
it<00:01:11.550> right<00:01:11.700> but<00:01:11.910> this<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.210> how<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.600> do<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:14.390> and<00:01:15.390> how

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
now I'm just pulsing it so that means

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.250 
now I'm just pulsing it so that means
you're<00:02:37.340> good<00:02:37.460> to<00:02:37.550> go<00:02:38.380> so<00:02:39.380> open<00:02:39.710> it<00:02:39.830> up<00:02:40.930> go<00:02:41.930> ahead

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
and pour it in and this makes just a

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.180 
and pour it in and this makes just a
little<00:02:53.570> more<00:02:53.930> than<00:02:54.170> a<00:02:54.200> glass<00:02:54.410> but<00:02:54.740> that's<00:02:54.890> okay

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
little more than a glass but that's okay

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.820 
little more than a glass but that's okay
and<00:02:55.820> then<00:02:56.240> of<00:02:56.330> course<00:02:56.570> you<00:02:56.930> can<00:02:57.170> always<00:02:57.350> top<00:02:57.650> it

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
and then of course you can always top it

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:14.850 
and then of course you can always top it
with<00:02:58.040> some<00:02:58.310> spray<00:02:59.150> whip<00:02:59.540> cream<00:03:05.440> caramel<00:03:06.440> syrup
