00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
because um normally I you would use a

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.369 
because um normally I you would use a
cleanser<00:02:35.099> and<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:36.030> scrub<00:02:36.870> cream<00:02:37.879> um<00:02:39.379> like

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
cleanser and a scrub cream um like

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.890

separate<00:02:40.769> from<00:02:41.040> each<00:02:41.190> other<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:41.879> this<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.390> like

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
separate from each other so this is like

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.580 
separate from each other so this is like
a<00:02:43.170> yeah<00:02:43.739> it<00:02:44.040> says<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:44.970> like<00:02:45.180> do<00:02:45.450> action<00:02:46.019> so<00:02:46.349> I

a yeah it says it like do action so I

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.379
