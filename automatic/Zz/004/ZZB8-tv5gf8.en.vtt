00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
does not launch a cinematic but I think

does not launch a cinematic but I think
it's<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.860> nice<00:01:08.070> touch<00:01:08.540> so<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.930> game<00:01:10.140> opens<00:01:10.590> up<00:01:10.770> a

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
it's a nice touch so the game opens up a

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.980 
it's a nice touch so the game opens up a
whole<00:01:11.070> new<00:01:11.220> mini<00:01:11.460> location<00:01:12.119> after<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.750> kill

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.410 
pagan in the helicopter okay so first up
then<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.070> means<00:01:17.430> we<00:01:17.610> can<00:01:17.790> discount<00:01:18.210> the
