00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
I'm proud of you what is the story with

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.580 
I'm proud of you what is the story with
the<00:01:44.270> correct<00:01:44.569> pronunciation<00:01:44.840> of<00:01:45.319> your<00:01:45.440> last

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
the correct pronunciation of your last

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.090 
the correct pronunciation of your last
name<00:01:45.920> it's<00:01:46.220> not<00:01:46.280> technically<00:01:47.119> George's<00:01:48.100> we're

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
name it's not technically George's we're

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.590 
name it's not technically George's we're
German<00:01:49.490> and<00:01:49.670> I<00:01:49.700> think<00:01:49.939> the<00:01:50.090> proper

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
German and I think the proper

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.249 
German and I think the proper
pronunciation<00:01:50.810> is<00:01:51.590> Girgis<00:01:52.989> but<00:01:53.989> I<00:01:54.019> think<00:01:54.200> it

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
pronunciation is Girgis but I think it

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:55.749 
pronunciation is Girgis but I think it
was<00:01:54.379> also<00:01:54.500> spelled<00:01:54.950> different<00:01:55.280> I<00:01:55.369> think<00:01:55.610> there

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
was also spelled different I think there

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.990 
was also spelled different I think there
was<00:01:55.910> an<00:01:56.149> e<00:01:56.300> in<00:01:56.690> it<00:01:56.869> before<00:01:57.489> and<00:01:58.489> I<00:01:58.610> think<00:01:58.670> ever

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
was an e in it before and I think ever

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.430 
was an e in it before and I think ever
since<00:01:59.060> we<00:01:59.300> came<00:01:59.420> over<00:01:59.479> to<00:01:59.660> Canada<00:02:00.080> they

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
since we came over to Canada they
