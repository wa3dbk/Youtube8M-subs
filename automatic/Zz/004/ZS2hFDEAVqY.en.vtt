00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.580
 that looks like 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.740
 a little balan &amp; design that is that is 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.400
 and so on it wind costs a lot 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.920
 functions 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.260
 Firstly this button using which 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.660
 This candy is activated but now 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.829
 she is not active and we have not lost anything 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:46.190
 this is a lever to choose which 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.860
 candy we need blue and time and ems 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:59.180

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.280
 here is the hole from which the coin falls 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.440
 which does not suit us and it is normal 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.220
 coin acceptor accepting money also 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:16.300
 there is a little bank in the back 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:20.000

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.009
 so first demonstrate how 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.409
 This candy works with coins 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.390
 which do not fit 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:31.569
 if we take the usual five-kopeck 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.569
 Kazakhstan coin it will not work 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:40.190
 even if she stuck in if we press 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:46.509
 let us nothing falls to us to fall 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:53.950
 I can only push the mechanism myself 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:53.950
 what a cog and in the end it falls 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.310
 the mechanism is very heavy and ordinary 5 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.310
