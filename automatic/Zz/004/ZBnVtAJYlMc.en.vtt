so it's coming out soon so Roberto is
going<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.510> help<00:00:18.720> us<00:00:18.840> understand<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.800> game<00:00:19.920> a

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
going to help us understand the game a

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.849 
going to help us understand the game a
little<00:00:20.160> bit<00:00:20.279> yes<00:00:21.000> so<00:00:21.539> galaxy<00:00:22.109> defenders<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.740> a

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
little bit yes so galaxy defenders is a

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.859 
little bit yes so galaxy defenders is a
competitive<00:00:23.490> game<00:00:23.699> science<00:00:24.269> fiction<00:00:24.420> game

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
competitive game science fiction game

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.169 
competitive game science fiction game
where<00:00:25.320> players<00:00:25.820> will<00:00:27.380> run<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.680> team<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.189> Ages

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
where players will run a team of Ages

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.930 
where players will run a team of Ages
which<00:00:30.390> are<00:00:30.660> facing<00:00:31.140> off<00:00:31.320> an<00:00:31.590> hourly<00:00:31.920> basis<00:00:32.340> so

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
which are facing off an hourly basis so

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.720 
which are facing off an hourly basis so
125<00:00:33.870> players<00:00:34.230> can<00:00:34.620> play<00:00:34.770> each<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.550> them

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
125 players can play each of them

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.700 
125 players can play each of them
controlling<00:00:36.270> with<00:00:36.510> an<00:00:36.690> agent<00:00:37.079> all<00:00:37.530> agents

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
controlling with an agent all agents

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.850 
controlling with an agent all agents
have<00:00:38.129> very<00:00:39.090> strong<00:00:39.530> characteristics<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:40.710> they

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
have very strong characteristics so they

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.549 
have very strong characteristics so they
are<00:00:40.980> somehow<00:00:41.219> archetypes<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.270> their<00:00:42.510> own<00:00:42.690> kind

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
are somehow archetypes of their own kind

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.979 
are somehow archetypes of their own kind
so<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.489> like<00:00:44.520> an<00:00:44.879> infiltrator<00:00:45.450> which<00:00:45.809> is

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
so that is like an infiltrator which is

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.750 
so that is like an infiltrator which is
very<00:00:46.230> vicious<00:00:46.710> very<00:00:47.070> good<00:00:47.280> be<00:00:47.370> sneaking

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
very vicious very good be sneaking

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.560 
very vicious very good be sneaking
around<00:00:48.590> there<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.770> sniper<00:00:50.610> there<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.329> right

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
around there is a sniper there is right

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.810 
around there is a sniper there is right
a<00:00:51.600> marine<00:00:52.079> there<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> Hulk<00:00:53.039> which<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.670> can

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
a marine there is a Hulk which you can

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.049 
a marine there is a Hulk which you can
deal<00:00:54.750> with<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:55.050> lot<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.469> damage<00:00:55.800> egos<00:00:56.340> get<00:00:56.610> my

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
deal with a lot of damage egos get my

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.260 
deal with a lot of damage egos get my
attack<00:00:57.390> which<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.949> specialist<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.550> using<00:01:00.000> tech

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
attack which is specialist in using tech

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.609 
attack which is specialist in using tech
devices<00:01:00.629> like<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.980> GT<00:01:02.340> go<00:01:02.550> 200<00:01:03.239> online<00:01:03.629> drone

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
devices like the GT go 200 online drone

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.730 
devices like the GT go 200 online drone
of<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.460> century<00:01:05.939> Gong<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:08.119> the<00:01:09.500> cool<00:01:10.500> feature

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
of the century Gong and the cool feature

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.700 
of the century Gong and the cool feature
is<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.299> if<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.570> play<00:01:12.780> against<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.290> alien

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
is that if you play against the alien

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.190 
is that if you play against the alien
which<00:01:14.250> are<00:01:14.460> handled<00:01:15.090> by<00:01:15.600> an<00:01:15.840> artificial

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
which are handled by an artificial

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.899 
which are handled by an artificial
intelligence<00:01:16.830> system<00:01:16.860> which<00:01:17.340> works<00:01:17.640> really

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
intelligence system which works really

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.240 
intelligence system which works really
nicely<00:01:18.330> because<00:01:19.110> each<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.920> alien

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
nicely because each of the alien

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.550 
nicely because each of the alien
different<00:01:20.729> alien<00:01:21.060> brings<00:01:21.330> as<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.990> different

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
different alien brings as a different

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.490 
different alien brings as a different
behavior<00:01:22.979> which<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.119> handled<00:01:24.630> by<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.900> alien

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
behavior which is handled by the alien

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.830 
behavior which is handled by the alien
cards<00:01:25.950> ok<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.820> then<00:01:26.970> cards<00:01:27.360> essentially

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
cards ok and then cards essentially

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.200 
cards ok and then cards essentially
directs<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.530> with<00:01:29.159> different<00:01:29.369> behavior

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
directs you with different behavior

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.170 
directs you with different behavior
works<00:01:30.689> too

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
works too

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.140 
works too
you<00:01:32.360> want<00:01:32.690> the<00:01:33.110> alien<00:01:33.830> behavior<00:01:34.280> will<00:01:34.520> be<00:01:34.670> so

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
you want the alien behavior will be so

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.820 
you want the alien behavior will be so
for<00:01:35.300> example<00:01:35.390> we<00:01:35.720> will<00:01:35.810> have<00:01:36.110> aliens<00:01:36.620> that

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
for example we will have aliens that

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.100 
for example we will have aliens that
want<00:01:37.130> to<00:01:37.250> get<00:01:37.370> in<00:01:37.580> close<00:01:37.790> combat<00:01:38.120> against<00:01:38.840> your

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
want to get in close combat against your

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.410 
want to get in close combat against your
agencies<00:01:39.830> are<00:01:39.950> we<00:01:40.040> trying<00:01:40.280> to<00:01:40.490> close<00:01:41.060> and

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
agencies are we trying to close and

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.140 
agencies are we trying to close and
attack<00:01:41.750> it<00:01:42.260> was<00:01:42.950> come<00:01:43.220> up<00:01:43.430> as<00:01:43.610> fast<00:01:43.790> as<00:01:44.000> they

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
attack it was come up as fast as they

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.540 
attack it was come up as fast as they
can<00:01:44.360> you<00:01:44.870> will<00:01:45.020> have<00:01:45.140> aliens<00:01:46.040> which<00:01:46.310> would

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
can you will have aliens which would

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.030 
can you will have aliens which would
prefer<00:01:46.940> to<00:01:47.270> attack<00:01:47.750> from<00:01:47.990> a<00:01:48.050> distance<00:01:48.620> so<00:01:48.890> that

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
prefer to attack from a distance so that

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.670 
prefer to attack from a distance so that
we<00:01:49.190> try<00:01:49.460> to<00:01:49.520> get<00:01:49.850> far<00:01:50.479> from<00:01:50.750> the<00:01:50.870> air<00:01:51.320> from<00:01:51.619> your

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
we try to get far from the air from your

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.609 
we try to get far from the air from your
agents<00:01:52.400> and<00:01:52.700> shoot<00:01:53.119> them<00:01:53.360> you<00:01:54.080> have<00:01:54.200> in<00:01:54.440> an

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
agents and shoot them you have in an

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.040 
agents and shoot them you have in an
alien<00:01:55.250> some<00:01:55.460> very<00:01:55.790> specific<00:01:56.090> special

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
look for the most wanted agents and try

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:07.560 
look for the most wanted agents and try
to<00:02:01.970> adopt<00:02:02.390> them<00:02:02.690> in<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:02.930> web<00:02:03.140> to<00:02:03.410> drag<00:02:03.979> them<00:02:04.330> away

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.229 

Allen<00:02:08.570> cars<00:02:08.869> are<00:02:09.170> half<00:02:09.739> of<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.369> artificial

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
Allen cars are half of the artificial

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.180 
Allen cars are half of the artificial
