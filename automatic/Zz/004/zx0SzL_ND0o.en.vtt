attack or preventing recurrent heart
disease<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.699> we<00:00:21.090> do<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.449> through<00:00:21.930> several

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
disease and we do this through several

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.920 
disease and we do this through several
week<00:00:23.100> several<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.300> we<00:00:24.420> do<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.660> through

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
week several and we do this through

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.460 
week several and we do this through
several<00:00:25.580> mechanisms<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:27.180> first<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.689> by

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
several mechanisms the first is by

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.339 
several mechanisms the first is by
seeing<00:00:28.890> patients<00:00:29.160> in<00:00:29.730> our<00:00:30.050> outpatient<00:00:31.050> clinic

seeing patients in our outpatient clinic

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.190 
seeing patients in our outpatient clinic
as<00:00:31.500> well<00:00:31.710> as<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.430> hospital<00:00:32.910> and

as well as in the hospital and

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.660 
as well as in the hospital and
discussing<00:00:34.200> with<00:00:34.380> them<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.770> importance<00:00:35.370> of

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
discussing with them the importance of

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.810 
discussing with them the importance of
lifestyle<00:00:36.510> changes<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.500> order<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.370> reduce

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
lifestyle changes in order to reduce

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.690 
lifestyle changes in order to reduce
their<00:00:39.090> risk<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.890> a<00:00:40.890> heart<00:00:40.920> attack<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.579> that

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
their risk of a heart attack and that

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.170 
their risk of a heart attack and that
might<00:00:41.910> include<00:00:43.010> ways<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.250> quit<00:00:44.460> smoking<00:00:44.579> or

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
might include ways to quit smoking or

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.360 
might include ways to quit smoking or
improve<00:00:45.510> their<00:00:45.690> diet<00:00:45.989> lowering<00:00:46.980> cholesterol

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
improve their diet lowering cholesterol

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.700 
improve their diet lowering cholesterol
and<00:00:48.059> blood<00:00:48.180> put<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.750> lowering<00:00:49.500> cholesterol

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
and blood put and lowering cholesterol

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.610 
and blood put and lowering cholesterol
and<00:00:50.309> blood<00:00:50.579> pressure<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:51.360> several<00:00:52.079> different

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
and blood pressure so several different

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.520 
and blood pressure so several different
fast<00:00:52.920> several<00:00:53.910> different<00:00:54.120> factors<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.750> go

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
fast several different factors that go

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.529 
fast several different factors that go
into<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.980> we<00:00:56.760> also<00:00:56.910> have<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.180> research

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
into this we also have a research

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.330 
into this we also have a research
program<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.289> our<00:00:58.379> research<00:00:58.680> program<00:00:59.190> is

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
program and our research program is

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.720 
program and our research program is
really<00:00:59.609> involved<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.300> identifying<00:01:00.559> either

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
really involved in identifying either

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.090 
really involved in identifying either
new<00:01:02.730> exciting<00:01:03.350> treatment<00:01:04.350> or<00:01:04.500> existing

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
new exciting treatment or existing

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.000 
new exciting treatment or existing
therapies<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:06.000> have<00:01:06.659> not<00:01:06.990> been<00:01:07.049> proven<00:01:07.770> yet

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
therapies that have not been proven yet

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.060 
therapies that have not been proven yet
to<00:01:08.549> reduce<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.390> risk<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:10.110> having<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.890> heart

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
to reduce the risk of of having a heart

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.550 
to reduce the risk of of having a heart
attack<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.580> our<00:01:12.060> research<00:01:12.510> runs<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.350> gamut

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
attack so our research runs the gamut

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.999 
attack so our research runs the gamut
from<00:01:13.740> looking<00:01:14.580> at<00:01:14.729> new<00:01:15.240> medications<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.740> may

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
from looking at new medications that may

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.200 
from looking at new medications that may
raise<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.369> level<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> good<00:01:18.000> cholesterol

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
raise the level of the good cholesterol

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.560 
raise the level of the good cholesterol
to<00:01:19.080> reduce<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.530> risk<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.860> heart<00:01:19.890> attack

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
to reduce the risk of a heart attack

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.030 
to reduce the risk of a heart attack
looking<00:01:21.570> at<00:01:23.630> emotions<00:01:24.630> how<00:01:25.259> do<00:01:25.320> emotions

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
looking at emotions how do emotions

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.249 
looking at emotions how do emotions
affect<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.670> heart<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.810> we've<00:01:28.020> done

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
affect the heart and so we've done

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.980 
affect the heart and so we've done
studies<00:01:28.680> looking<00:01:29.220> at<00:01:29.430> both<00:01:30.060> laughter<00:01:30.689> and

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
studies looking at both laughter and

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.100 
studies looking at both laughter and
more<00:01:31.560> recently<00:01:31.740> joyful<00:01:32.579> music<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.869> fact

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
more recently joyful music and the fact

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.870 
more recently joyful music and the fact
that<00:01:34.229> they<00:01:34.820> interplay<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:37.430> mind<00:01:38.430> heart

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
that they interplay so this mind heart

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.249 
that they interplay so this mind heart
connection<00:01:39.240> we<00:01:39.600> think<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.320> important<00:01:41.070> in

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
connection we think is is important in

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.840 
connection we think is is important in
effecting<00:01:43.259> heart<00:01:43.500> healthy<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.189> think<00:01:44.430> some

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
effecting heart healthy so I think some

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.620 
effecting heart healthy so I think some
of<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.060> uniqueness<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.979> our<00:01:46.979> Center<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.820> that

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
of the uniqueness of our Center is that

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.639 
of the uniqueness of our Center is that
we<00:01:49.310> incorporate<00:01:50.310> both<00:01:50.810> traditional<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:51.869> less

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
we incorporate both traditional and less

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.889 
we incorporate both traditional and less
traditional<00:01:53.960> modes<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.350> therapy<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.899> so

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
traditional modes of therapy and so

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.230 
traditional modes of therapy and so
we're<00:01:58.290> not<00:01:58.469> just<00:01:58.740> looking<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.579> give<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.210> a

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
we're not just looking to give you a

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.450 
we're not just looking to give you a
medication<00:02:00.719> we're<00:02:01.590> looking<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.130> really

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
medication we're looking to really

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.249 
medication we're looking to really
discuss<00:02:03.119> what<00:02:03.990> other<00:02:05.060> behavioral<00:02:06.060> factors<00:02:06.780> or

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
discuss what other behavioral factors or

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.350 
discuss what other behavioral factors or
what<00:02:07.439> other<00:02:09.379> non-traditional<00:02:10.379> or

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
what other non-traditional or

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.210 
what other non-traditional or
nonpharmacologic<00:02:12.500> ways

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
nonpharmacologic ways

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.980 
nonpharmacologic ways
reduce<00:02:14.700> your<00:02:14.910> risk<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.270> heart<00:02:15.480> disease<00:02:15.540> I

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
reduce your risk of heart disease I

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.940 
reduce your risk of heart disease I
think<00:02:16.440> our<00:02:16.800> specialty<00:02:17.460> allows<00:02:18.020> us<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.440> really

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
think our specialty allows us to really

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.420 
think our specialty allows us to really
evolve<00:02:20.430> in<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.820> new<00:02:20.970> manner<00:02:21.210> so<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:22.620> area<00:02:23.070> of

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
evolve in a new manner so the area of

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.540 
evolve in a new manner so the area of
prevention<00:02:24.210> has<00:02:24.690> really<00:02:25.140> not<00:02:25.440> gained<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.250> lot

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550
