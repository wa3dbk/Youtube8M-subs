00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 and so hello lovers of powerful 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.089
 firecracker 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.400
 broadcast a thorough review today 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.200
 We are the second novelty from Russian fer bright 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.059
 firecracker grenade and so honestly 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.220
 Once upon a time Russian server to her husband 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.770
 let loose petard grenades i'm not even 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.580
 caught the photo I think you will now 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.920
 see on their screens now where else 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.250
 the fifteenth year they decided to revive 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.099
 this petard and made here such 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.130
 a huge torch as if you really 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.649
 In fact, this is really the official petard 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:40.350
 size larger than corsair 8 first 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.250
 true that these are two combined firecrackers 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.170
 in fact this is just a pen 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.770
 made of cardboard so you can 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:54.899
 take here here is set on fire and far from 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.710
 ask right here on the pen written 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.109
 instruction 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.809
 I did not have a whole box because 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:05.790
 that in the box 6 pieces and then it was worth 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:08.840
 100 164 rubles 130 I do not remember this one 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.159
 6 pieces go broke it was not cool so 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.170
 photos of packaging I think here I am too 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.270
 see everything on their screens 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.759
 presented as a general looks as well here 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.189
 we will deal with petards already with me 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.130
 I took two pieces of hell for analysis but also one 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.939
 on tests compared to stranded 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.060
 corsair 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.420
 she's like that a-star is longer 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.640
 David firecracker but he's a grenade like before 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.710
 a grenade will make you see anything 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.430
 so measurements 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:45.320
 measuring the length of the petard 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:47.880
 how many 12 centimeters is your diameter 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:52.229
 three and a half centimeters as they could 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.049
 Jumbo diameter handle length 14 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.170
 centimeters of this 26 centimeters length 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:02.579
 structural axes 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:06.060
 is it somehow dismantle the hooks and 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:09.330
 I went to the wreath with pitch that here and then 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.929
 let's see the petard itself and so the hotel is on 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.420
 a pen 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.219
 and there you can still see that the pen is usually 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.560
 goes deep in put on 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:18.390
 for you but I can say that the seal 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.219
 starts somewhere here 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.040
 grenade in this one that's just 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:26.340
 cardboard case from above when as below 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.530
 there was such a red film 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.409
 colors cool 9 like 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.049
 new behavior punched so 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:36.420
 click cool and here it is the usual 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:40.019
 not thick on itself usually wick on 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.909
 from the plaster filling and there will be further 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.310
 Rosstat but as you understand the effect is just 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:46.439
 clap i speak loudly 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.840
 the clap is just a loud clap and 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:52.290
 so proceed to conceal 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.400
 firecrackers if you need to kindle a fireplace on 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.340
 bring a fire even a grenade 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.810
 shoot yourself all this cardboard and 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.139
 run restlessly your fireplace 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.139
 well, in the meantime, and true size 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:10.530
 firecracker here is this but it is more than 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:10.680
 true size okromya corsair its length 6 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.469
 cm 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.040
 still they are four and a half here 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:18.150
 diapers 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.840
 if you know here on top of a gypsum 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.129
 below 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:29.129
 a mixture of clay and gypsum which I do not know what 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:32.129
 such but we will be introduced but boy I 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:35.729
 Of course I suffered, but I am beautiful and opened 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:39.540
 and so here is the whole cast in her to 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:42.150
 which is poured into a grenade was x took off to 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.129
 hands so sticky to this cardboard then 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.329
 but I took it off and here it is possible 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:52.500
 see here the composition and here such here 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:54.090
 second stone framed present so 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:04:00.359
 only now we need to know where I should be 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:08.159
 the composition pour out and now everyone has found 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:09.659
 fire crucible and pour out the composition so here 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.130
 so in one fell swoop I think there already 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.800
 almost all up 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.610
 such decent we will find as a handful 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.930
 composition 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.560
 straight grenade comrades here and here is all 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:25.590
 before 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:28.800
 or it seems to me yeah like now 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.370
 the whole composition and there sticks out a piece 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.910
 wick 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:37.050
 which sets you on fire it costs 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:39.690
 like that, on the side of the sharpness and out yet 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.680
 then here it is shorter than everyone wanted now 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.100
 will get 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:47.700
 here and we will experience it later and let's go 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:51.690
 let's wait for this composition and test it in practice 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:55.740
 our grenade and so the composition tests 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:58.080
 no grenades and peal mega gorman no matter how 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.000
 strange in pomegranate 108 and beauty 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.490
 and lit from behind athletes corsairs 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.710
 The transfer system I wrote can 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:08.160
 count how many gaetano 19 and a half 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.040
 centimeters and the wick here and you can 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.040
 case watch something i have 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.040
 pushing 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:22.409
 but 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.529
 mute 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:24.529
 this 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:45.400
 fame went crazy and attacked let's him 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:48.390
 it's different to burn this thing and 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.390
 very thought out 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:45.810
 and so on so on 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:48.569
 the composition of the grenades but today we do not all go 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:52.259
 is experiencing the most grenade and watch 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:54.839
 how powerful is it and so is the mega review 

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:57.930
 Mega eat after corsairs do not know 

00:06:54.839 --> 00:07:00.389

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:03.770
 poods will not leave well to see 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:03.770
 ok, how do we work 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:32.580
 yes it was more powerful than it was left 

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:34.860
 Only such a stick that 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.420
