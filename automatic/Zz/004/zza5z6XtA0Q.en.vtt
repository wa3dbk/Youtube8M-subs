the conditioner doesn't um it dissolves
very<00:02:37.080> quickly<00:02:37.620> like<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.370> can<00:02:38.490> put<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.670> lot<00:02:38.880> on

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
like I said so you have to put a lot of

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.860 
like I said so you have to put a lot of
it<00:02:52.860> on<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.910> then<00:02:54.060> on<00:02:54.120> top<00:02:54.330> of<00:02:54.390> that<00:02:54.540> I<00:02:54.630> also

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
it on and then on top of that I also

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.750 
it on and then on top of that I also
purchased<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.550> sulfate-free<00:02:56.550> smoothing

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
purchased the sulfate-free smoothing

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.660 
purchased the sulfate-free smoothing
system<00:02:57.510> humidity<00:02:58.290> define<00:02:58.800> leave<00:02:59.070> and<00:02:59.250> cream

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
system humidity define leave and cream

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.110 
system humidity define leave and cream
and<00:03:00.260> it's<00:03:01.260> for<00:03:01.500> frizz<00:03:01.830> control<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.790> it's<00:03:02.940> also

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
and it's for frizz control and it's also

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.600 
and it's for frizz control and it's also
silicone<00:03:03.630> free<00:03:03.870> so<00:03:04.500> if<00:03:05.190> you<00:03:05.310> guys<00:03:05.400> know

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
silicone free so if you guys know

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.310 
silicone free so if you guys know
biosilk<00:03:06.150> i<00:03:06.239> use<00:03:06.390> biosilk<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:06.959> then<00:03:07.050> actually

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
biosilk i use biosilk and then actually

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.750 
biosilk i use biosilk and then actually
has<00:03:07.440> silicones<00:03:07.860> in<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:08.100> which<00:03:08.280> makes<00:03:08.459> it<00:03:08.550> a<00:03:08.640> lot

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
has silicones in it which makes it a lot

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.680 
has silicones in it which makes it a lot
more<00:03:08.820> harder<00:03:09.270> to<00:03:09.360> wash<00:03:09.540> out<00:03:10.670> so<00:03:11.670> this<00:03:12.450> one<00:03:12.600> is

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
more harder to wash out so this one is

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.850 
more harder to wash out so this one is
silicon<00:03:13.019> free<00:03:13.200> so<00:03:13.380> it's<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.620> lot<00:03:13.830> more

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
silicon free so it's a lot more

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.949 
silicon free so it's a lot more
lightweight<00:03:14.310> than<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.730> Bioscope<00:03:15.269> you<00:03:15.660> all

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
lightweight than the Bioscope you all

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:16.850 
lightweight than the Bioscope you all
you<00:03:16.019> have<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.200> do<00:03:16.260> is<00:03:16.350> literally<00:03:16.590> put<00:03:16.830> a

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.090 
hair um it doesn't feel thick it doesn't
feel<00:03:21.209> heavy<00:03:21.420> it<00:03:21.630> doesn't<00:03:21.930> look<00:03:22.049> Gracie<00:03:22.320> the
