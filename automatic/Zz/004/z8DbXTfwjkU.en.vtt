 once made interviews with artists of the globe called chapter 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.759
 and the popular news newspaper published in this interview on October 1, 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.210
 1999 on a Friday 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.479
 ask with cadu 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.900
 when he is doing that novel his life 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.190
 germain 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.260

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
 your children watch vision 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.850

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.250
 in a sixth division 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.590
 not why in today's trading session 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.710
 We are going to work on television buildings in the sixth edition 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.780
 that's why 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.710
 the sixth division 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.810
 but if you can explain why I wanted in the sixth edition the production brings 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.600
 messages with the index 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.140
 I can see the inter talking 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.089
 and teaches us 

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:13.430
 television is bad for children 3 to interfere negatively 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.050
 the formation of a person there is protocol - they will publish what is 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.709
 Speaking 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.080
 This is not afraid of the chiefs of the globe of what you're talking about. 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.429
 can only suffer some reprisal 

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:26.899
 and said no, I'm not afraid 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:29.899
 before I'm a professional I'm a citizen 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:33.399
 and in my house, I'm the boss 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.739
 Who's the boss in your house? 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.559

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:47.869

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:50.869
 Who's the boss in your house? 

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:53.449
 in crisis 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:56.449
 it's difficult 

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:59.819
 and pedro gomes I intend 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.199
 since today 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:04.289
 make it 

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:06.729

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:08.859
 I sent you to my house 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.639
 we are being honest 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.639
 depends on what happened 

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:21.769
 the terminal with which they have something think a very large project that 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:22.560
 go 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.489
 bring comfort you 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.459
 the spiritual side of the material side you will leave here can not 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.159
 accompany accompany here there pain goes behind the bed 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.669
 that family there was pedro júnior ptb and pdt that already learned to run 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.489
 behind it will not be able to accompany each one 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.489
 but each one is aware of the break when leaving here 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:46.479
 but there is someone who will accompany you to your home 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.189
 and will see what you will get night on the hypothesis quite a bit angry 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:53.179
 your side 

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:56.609
 He's not going to tell you to eat at least to me. He never said that. 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.689
 the complex 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:00.449
 xii suspicion accompanies 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.289
 in sorrow and in joy 

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:07.389
 and when you sit in front of the television set watched side be sensitive 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:08.749
 the lia 

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:12.299
 take a can of coke for you to open or tapuio on the side watch who is 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.739
 who is on the side with you shares 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.939
 Jesus 

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:19.940
 if you watch what you watch today 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.150
 if jesus were sitting next door with the pig base - together with you 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.300
 if he said yes or no 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.300
 the cet-rio does not 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.270
 would watch with him because you watch today 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.580
 but we're watching eight jesus in the state on our side but I can 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.449
 to affirm that this is what we are forgetting 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.639
 it's routine people who can feel 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.919
 ah I go to church Sunday in the church you can not miss our house we have 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:51.780
 a room 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.810
 we can not have a prayer room 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.810
 We can not raise or vote at your house. 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:02.029
 will be that all the cases that are designed are designed the room of the 

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:04.250
 bathroom to do the necessities with a shower 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.630
 The kitchen chat room to cook the room power room from the beginning of a 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.720
 prayer room in addition to the television room in the reading room will be 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.809
 has ever seen some house has room for prayer 

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:18.809
 so people stop any kind of wave 

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:23.309
 Apr the first john chapter 2 

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:26.710
 I finish reading this exercise in three weeks 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.540
 be careful with the type of music you are listening to the music in the car 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.249
 when you connect the diabolical one it generates in people in modernity 

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:45.430
 rebellion 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.430
 witchcraft 

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:53.629
 we speak of praise we speak of worship but what does one mean 

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:55.509
 praise 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:57.230
 I can tell 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.229
 and count 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:02.409
 would be patting for the new year be there or ben there 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:05.409
 in place of this year's camilo highlighting 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.830
 Why it is to be worshiped said that it is important to know 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:16.289
 is to attract the presence of God 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:19.509
 people attracting the manifestation of holy spirit people who have feet 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:23.070
 That's why God seeks true worshipers who love spirit and truth. 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.070
 which is true because there are false durations 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:30.949
 and not about having sex in the car if I put a praise 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:33.229
 I put a song of praise 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:35.520
 can be done indoors 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.629
 we leave and cover sound equipment already connected on evangelical radios has 

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:40.960
 so many here in Campinas to 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.840
 most everything that dates but at least one sees with something the antenna 

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:52.119
 the goalkeeper 

00:06:52.119 --> 00:06:52.329
