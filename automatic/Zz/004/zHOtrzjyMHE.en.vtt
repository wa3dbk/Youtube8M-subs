well<00:00:00.329> my<00:00:00.480> project<00:00:00.870> today<00:00:00.989> is<00:00:01.170> I'm<00:00:01.860> going<00:00:01.949> to<00:00:02.010> go

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
well my project today is I'm going to go

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.329 
well my project today is I'm going to go
ahead<00:00:02.220> and<00:00:02.580> change<00:00:03.210> the<00:00:03.929> freewheel<00:00:04.710> on<00:00:05.069> this

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
ahead and change the freewheel on this

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.650 
ahead and change the freewheel on this
bike<00:00:06.470> this<00:00:07.470> has<00:00:07.649> got<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:08.069> Sachs<00:00:08.820> freewheel<00:00:09.510> on

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
bike this has got a Sachs freewheel on

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.410 
bike this has got a Sachs freewheel on
there<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:09.990> it's<00:00:10.139> a<00:00:10.200> bit<00:00:10.349> worn<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:11.420> shifting

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
there and it's a bit worn and shifting

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.759 
there and it's a bit worn and shifting
is<00:00:12.540> not<00:00:12.719> too<00:00:12.870> great<00:00:13.049> so<00:00:13.110> I'm<00:00:13.530> going<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.710> go

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
is not too great so I'm going to go

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.390 
is not too great so I'm going to go
ahead<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.160> put<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.400> brand<00:00:14.730> new<00:00:15.350> Shimano

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
ahead and put a brand new Shimano

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.510 
ahead and put a brand new Shimano
freewheel<00:00:17.510> what<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.539> freewheel<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.140> it's<00:00:20.130> a

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
freewheel what a freewheel is it's a

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.580 
freewheel what a freewheel is it's a
self-contained<00:00:21.180> little<00:00:21.570> unit<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.199> screws

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
self-contained little unit it screws

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.200 
self-contained little unit it screws
onto<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.430> hub<00:00:23.609> so<00:00:23.789> it's<00:00:23.910> got<00:00:24.000> like<00:00:24.090> little

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
onto the hub so it's got like little

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.470 
onto the hub so it's got like little
threads<00:00:24.630> back<00:00:24.810> here<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.460> it's<00:00:26.460> got<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.300> whole

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
threads back here and it's got the whole

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.500 
threads back here and it's got the whole
bearing<00:00:28.230> part<00:00:28.470> system<00:00:29.039> inside<00:00:29.490> there<00:00:29.820> so<00:00:30.359> it

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
bearing part system inside there so it

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.380 
bearing part system inside there so it
spins<00:00:30.810> on<00:00:31.140> there<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.859> it's<00:00:32.219> got<00:00:32.309> Paul's<00:00:32.669> so

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
spins on there and it's got Paul's so

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.840 
spins on there and it's got Paul's so
what<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.660> does<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.230> allows<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.829> spin<00:00:35.219> free

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
what it does is allows it to spin free

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.940 
what it does is allows it to spin free
in<00:00:36.030> one<00:00:36.210> direction<00:00:36.360> but<00:00:37.230> then<00:00:37.350> catch<00:00:37.649> in<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
in one direction but then catch in the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.040 
in one direction but then catch in the
other<00:00:38.100> direction<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.790> turns<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.270> wheel<00:00:39.420> so

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
other direction so it turns the wheel so

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.810 
other direction so it turns the wheel so
that's<00:00:40.200> why<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.379> freewheel<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.950> not<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.700> be

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
that's why the freewheel is not to be

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.610 
that's why the freewheel is not to be
confused<00:00:42.300> with<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.840> cassette<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.770> which<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
confused with a cassette in which the

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.920 
confused with a cassette in which the
little<00:00:46.620> bearing<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.340> hull<00:00:47.670> stuff<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.809> a

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
little bearing and hull stuff is in a

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.869 
little bearing and hull stuff is in a
part<00:00:49.230> another<00:00:49.770> part<00:00:50.070> that's<00:00:50.129> attached<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
part another part that's attached to the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.900 
part another part that's attached to the
hub<00:00:51.000> called<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.329> free<00:00:51.510> hub<00:00:52.640> but<00:00:53.640> I'll<00:00:53.760> probably

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
hub called a free hub but I'll probably

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.240 
hub called a free hub but I'll probably
do<00:00:54.059> another<00:00:54.090> video<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.690> too<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.289> first

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
do another video on that too so first

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.400 
do another video on that too so first
thing<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.399> want<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.550> do<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:57.079> remove<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.230> wheel

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
thing I want to do is remove the wheel

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.279 
thing I want to do is remove the wheel
and<00:00:58.739> just<00:00:59.399> for<00:00:59.550> ease<00:00:59.699> of<00:01:00.000> use<00:01:00.180> I've<00:01:00.359> got<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
and just for ease of use I've got the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.429 
and just for ease of use I've got the
chain<00:01:01.559> shifted<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> smallest<00:01:02.760> ring<00:01:03.570> just

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
chain shifted to the smallest ring just

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.140 
chain shifted to the smallest ring just
go<00:01:04.559> ahead<00:01:04.680> pop<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.100> down<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.729> makes<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.090> a

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
the other two types of tools I usually

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.710 
the other two types of tools I usually
do<00:03:09.989> it<00:03:10.079> but<00:03:10.109> on<00:03:10.260> this<00:03:10.379> kind<00:03:10.590> I<00:03:10.859> generally<00:03:11.250> don't

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
do it but on this kind I generally don't

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.869 
do it but on this kind I generally don't
so<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.750> slide<00:03:13.049> this<00:03:13.200> in<00:03:13.410> here<00:03:13.799> and<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:14.549> have<00:03:14.670> a<00:03:14.700> big

so I slide this in here and I have a big

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.910 
so I slide this in here and I have a big
crescent<00:03:15.329> wrench<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:15.780> I'm<00:03:16.650> going<00:03:16.769> to<00:03:16.829> fit

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
crescent wrench and I'm going to fit

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.110 
crescent wrench and I'm going to fit
this<00:03:17.040> onto<00:03:17.340> here<00:03:17.549> and<00:03:17.970> what<00:03:18.060> I<00:03:18.120> want<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.329> do<00:03:18.450> is

this onto here and what I want to do is

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.319 
this onto here and what I want to do is
turn<00:03:21.120> this<00:03:21.450> counterclockwise<00:03:22.849> now<00:03:23.849> if<00:03:24.150> this

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
turn this counterclockwise now if this

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.270 
turn this counterclockwise now if this
freewheels<00:03:24.810> been<00:03:25.109> on<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.560> bike<00:03:25.769> for<00:03:25.799> a<00:03:26.130> while

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
freewheels been on the bike for a while

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.400 
freewheels been on the bike for a while
what<00:03:27.030> happens<00:03:27.450> is<00:03:27.630> this<00:03:27.930> is<00:03:27.989> turning

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
what happens is this is turning

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.039 
what happens is this is turning
clockwise<00:03:29.130> it's<00:03:29.849> actually<00:03:30.419> tightening<00:03:30.930> this

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
clockwise it's actually tightening this

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.449 
clockwise it's actually tightening this
thing<00:03:31.290> on<00:03:31.470> so<00:03:31.650> if<00:03:31.739> this<00:03:31.829> has<00:03:31.980> been<00:03:32.010> on<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.250> bike

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
thing on so if this has been on the bike

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.849 
thing on so if this has been on the bike
for<00:03:32.489> a<00:03:32.669> while<00:03:33.410> these<00:03:34.410> things<00:03:34.680> can<00:03:34.829> be

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
for a while these things can be

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:38.210 
for a while these things can be
extremely<00:03:35.849> tight<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.620> you<00:03:37.620> may<00:03:37.739> need<00:03:37.980> more

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
extremely tight and you may need more

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.900 
extremely tight and you may need more
than<00:03:38.280> just<00:03:38.669> a<00:03:38.910> wrench<00:03:39.299> to<00:03:39.630> remove<00:03:39.840> it<00:03:40.760> so<00:03:41.760> what

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
than just a wrench to remove it so what

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.330 
than just a wrench to remove it so what
I'm<00:03:42.000> going<00:03:42.090> to<00:03:42.150> use<00:03:42.239> is<00:03:42.769> a<00:03:44.480> big<00:03:45.480> cheater<00:03:46.290> bar<00:03:46.590> so

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
I'm going to use is a big cheater bar so

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.979 
I'm going to use is a big cheater bar so
just<00:03:47.519> going<00:03:47.639> to<00:03:47.700> slide<00:03:47.940> this<00:03:48.180> over<00:03:48.239> the

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
just going to slide this over the

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.080 
just going to slide this over the
crescent<00:03:49.410> wrench<00:03:49.500> here<00:03:49.919> to<00:03:50.489> give<00:03:50.669> me<00:03:50.849> more

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
crescent wrench here to give me more

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.680 
crescent wrench here to give me more
leverage<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:53.150> usually<00:03:54.150> I'll<00:03:54.239> just<00:03:54.389> hold<00:03:54.540> the

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
leverage and usually I'll just hold the

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.270 
leverage and usually I'll just hold the
wheel<00:03:54.889> if<00:03:55.889> it's<00:03:56.069> real<00:03:57.410> tough<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:58.769> can<00:03:59.129> actually

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
wheel if it's real tough I can actually

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.520 
wheel if it's real tough I can actually
brace<00:03:59.970> this<00:04:00.180> up<00:04:00.359> against<00:04:00.599> maybe<00:04:00.900> a<00:04:00.989> wall<00:04:01.260> or

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
brace this up against maybe a wall or

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.069 
brace this up against maybe a wall or
something<00:04:01.889> but<00:04:02.459> usually<00:04:02.790> I<00:04:02.879> really<00:04:03.870> have<00:04:03.989> to

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
something but usually I really have to

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:08.420 
something but usually I really have to
do<00:04:04.200> that<00:04:04.340> usually<00:04:05.340> just<00:04:05.609> do<00:04:06.599> this<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:07.430> break

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
do that usually just do this and break

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.539 
do that usually just do this and break
that<00:04:08.609> thing<00:04:08.790> loose<00:04:10.099> and<00:04:11.099> once<00:04:11.310> you<00:04:11.400> get<00:04:11.519> a

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:17.870 
that thing loose and once you get a
loose<00:04:14.510> then<00:04:15.510> you<00:04:15.720> can<00:04:15.870> just<00:04:16.310> unscrew<00:04:17.310> this<00:04:17.579> off

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
loose then you can just unscrew this off

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.129 
loose then you can just unscrew this off
just<00:04:19.459> just<00:04:20.459> turn<00:04:20.669> this<00:04:20.760> tool

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.529 

now<00:04:23.409> come<00:04:23.650> loose<00:04:26.610> there<00:04:27.610> it<00:04:28.150> comes<00:04:28.330> right<00:04:28.479> off

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
now come loose there it comes right off

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.670 
now come loose there it comes right off
and<00:04:28.900> so<00:04:29.650> there's<00:04:29.860> that<00:04:29.949> the<00:04:30.460> threads<00:04:30.759> that<00:04:31.150> the

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
and so there's that the threads that the

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.610 
and so there's that the threads that the
freewheel<00:04:32.680> just<00:04:33.129> screws<00:04:33.460> right<00:04:33.490> on<00:04:33.819> to<00:04:34.620> okay

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
freewheel just screws right on to okay

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.309 
freewheel just screws right on to okay
I'm<00:04:35.710> ready<00:04:35.860> to<00:04:36.009> install<00:04:36.159> the<00:04:36.639> new<00:04:36.669> freewheel

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:37.319 
I'm ready to install the new freewheel

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:42.869 
I'm ready to install the new freewheel
just<00:04:38.319> slide<00:04:38.949> it<00:04:39.069> on<00:04:39.159> here<00:04:39.699> and<00:04:41.069> turn<00:04:42.069> it<00:04:42.219> on<00:04:42.400> get

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:42.879 
just slide it on here and turn it on get

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:46.379 
just slide it on here and turn it on get
the<00:04:42.969> threading<00:04:43.930> started<00:04:44.409> and<00:04:45.310> should<00:04:46.150> thread

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
the threading started and should thread

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:47.640 
the threading started and should thread
on<00:04:46.539> pretty<00:04:46.750> easy<00:04:46.930> then<00:04:47.169> just<00:04:47.349> go<00:04:47.409> ahead<00:04:47.469> and

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
on pretty easy then just go ahead and

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:54.480 
on pretty easy then just go ahead and
spin<00:04:48.069> it<00:04:48.189> on<00:04:51.870> till<00:04:52.870> it's<00:04:53.020> tight<00:04:53.289> there<00:04:53.650> then

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
spin it on till it's tight there then

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.520 
spin it on till it's tight there then
you<00:04:54.639> can<00:04:54.699> take<00:04:54.939> the<00:04:55.090> tool<00:04:55.330> slide<00:04:56.020> that<00:04:56.349> on

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
you can take the tool slide that on

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:03.020 
you can take the tool slide that on
there<00:04:59.159> use<00:05:00.159> the<00:05:00.370> wrench<00:05:00.610> to<00:05:01.569> go<00:05:01.659> ahead<00:05:01.780> and

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.670 
there use the wrench to go ahead and
tighten<00:05:04.030> it<00:05:04.180> on<00:05:04.300> there<00:05:04.659> I<00:05:04.840> don't<00:05:05.259> need<00:05:05.530> the

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
tighten it on there I don't need the

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.029 
tighten it on there I don't need the
cheater<00:05:06.159> bar<00:05:06.400> to<00:05:06.900> tighten<00:05:07.900> it<00:05:07.990> let's<00:05:08.199> use<00:05:08.860> the

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
cheater bar to tighten it let's use the

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:10.529 
cheater bar to tighten it let's use the
other<00:05:09.069> wrench<00:05:09.490> to<00:05:09.610> tighten<00:05:09.759> it<00:05:09.940> on<00:05:10.090> there<00:05:10.360> and

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
other wrench to tighten it on there and

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.749 
other wrench to tighten it on there and
that'll<00:05:11.440> be<00:05:11.530> good<00:05:11.560> enough<00:05:11.949> as<00:05:12.219> I<00:05:12.909> write<00:05:13.180> it<00:05:13.389> the

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 
that'll be good enough as I write it the

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:16.800 
that'll be good enough as I write it the
freewheel<00:05:15.759> itself<00:05:16.180> will<00:05:16.389> go<00:05:16.479> ahead<00:05:16.569> and

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
freewheel itself will go ahead and

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.300 
freewheel itself will go ahead and
tighten<00:05:17.020> itself<00:05:17.469> on<00:05:19.650> now<00:05:20.650> I<00:05:20.680> want<00:05:21.250> to

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
tighten itself on now I want to
