 [Music] 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.289
 Now when you go up on a motorcycle 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:28.140
 four cylinders the ears are only 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:31.590
 promoter through the subject matter that 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.810
 turn up the TV volume 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.820
 one of the main characteristics of 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:44.850
 four-cylinder engine is the snore 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:47.370
 there were only people who think a little 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.350
 lost but it is homogeneous 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.040
 now want to see let's compare with snoring 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.040
 of 12 cylinders 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.270
 [Music] 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.440
 it's already a shuffling deal, right? 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.180
 finding a better sound than the other is a 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.610
 matter of personal taste 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.030
 but this snore has been successful there 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.030
 Brazil 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.340
 the round sold more than 7 thousand units in the 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.790
 last year 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.450
 yamaha now debuts at xj6 to enter 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.550
 in the cake 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.530
 this type of bike fell in the taste of 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.410
 consumer because it goes well in several 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.420
 situations for example is agile to walk 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.940
 in the city and a motorcycle to the end 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.190
 I can put croup backpacks 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.480
 I have strength has the touch too much 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:40.010
 comfort to take trips trips and 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.290
 same time I can go to a track 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.240
 a day of training and have fun with 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.680
 because it only has a motor 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.680
 originating from sports motorcycles 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.860
 are compact and capable modern engines 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:00.760
 to surprise at the power the delivery is 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.760
 of 77 horses on yamaha and 102 on the wave 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:06.930
 force that satisfies even those who are 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.019
 accustomed to big bikes and the secret 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.319
 Guess where exactly it is in the four 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.319
 cylinders 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.560
 four cylinders you old you know 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.120
 100% how much you want to deliver 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.189
 power to the wheel then that 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.290
 softness you can do if you were driving 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:25.870
 200 horsepower bike you walk slowly 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.209
 but other classes of super soft dotz 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.680
 at the same time you want power passes 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.430
 8,000 rpm it becomes 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.799
 extremely aggressive in the engine 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.659
 monolithic or rises and falls 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.120
 leaps that often have to be 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:42.430
 compensated by softness counterweights 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.650
 of the four cylinders comes from the 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.409
 of the game of forces when two cylinders 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:52.569
 they are on top the others are down and 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:54.669
 this 10 consumption is greater on the other hand 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.989
 of my need to stay exchanging 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:03:01.060
 every hour as the engine is larger 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.040
 it is also heavier but the position 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.049
 it transforms the framework that would 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.939
 made with quality 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:13.030
 it is clear that the greatest weight would be the mode of 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:14.319
 mixed use of long suspensions but in the 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.299
 urban motorbikes 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.340
 this higher concentrated weight near the 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.470
 center of gravity that is the point of 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.359
 motorcycle balance up to 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.280
 because near the center of gravity you 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.280
 keep motorcycle more balanced 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.920
 some machines have already made history with 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.320
 the four cylinders 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.890
 recently the suzuki bandit and 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.530
 returning even more in time to 750 outside 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.510
 of the wheel that in the 70s became known 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.490
 by the nickname of seven rooster 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.680
 first that she called attention or she 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.270
 passing a straight on a street looks like a 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.130
 formula 1 was very similar to 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.760
 season's formation 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.290
 she is considered the motorcycle of the century 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.900
 this new generation has a strong design 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.050
 but when the four cylinders come in 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.180
 action and agility and steal the scene 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.640
 already who likes to see to believe the 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.739
 accelerator brands quick answers from 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.739
 engine may increase the sound 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.510

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:18.080
