hundreds of books hundreds of videos and
it<00:02:06.830> just<00:02:07.009> opened<00:02:07.459> up<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:07.940> whole<00:02:08.090> world<00:02:08.360> to<00:02:08.599> me

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
it just opened up the whole world to me

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.410 
it just opened up the whole world to me
which<00:02:09.080> I'm<00:02:09.259> so<00:02:09.530> grateful<00:02:09.560> for<00:02:09.979> I<00:02:10.220> mean<00:02:10.610> I<00:02:10.970> can't

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
was diagnosed with with inoperable brain

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.320 
was diagnosed with with inoperable brain
cancer<00:02:27.709> but<00:02:27.830> no<00:02:27.980> she<00:02:28.040> had<00:02:28.459> to<00:02:28.489> surgery<00:02:29.030> yes

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.990 
to surgery surgery when she was young
right<00:02:31.640> when<00:02:32.390> she<00:02:32.510> was<00:02:32.629> 13<00:02:33.050> both<00:02:33.770> them<00:02:34.010> they

couldn't get it all out they could not
get<00:02:36.410> oil<00:02:36.680> right<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.220> basically<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.690> then

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
get oil right and basically and then

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.540 
get oil right and basically and then
Laura<00:02:39.050> I<00:02:39.290> told<00:02:39.470> her<00:02:39.590> no<00:02:39.770> more<00:02:39.950> brain<00:02:40.160> surgery

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
Laura I told her no more brain surgery

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.729 
Laura I told her no more brain surgery
they<00:02:41.330> well<00:02:41.629> no<00:02:41.840> said<00:02:42.140> that<00:02:42.379> they<00:02:42.530> couldn't

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
they well no said that they couldn't

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.020 
they well no said that they couldn't
really<00:02:42.920> don't<00:02:43.160> win<00:02:43.280> it<00:02:43.430> that's<00:02:43.550> gonna<00:02:43.730> go<00:02:43.879> in

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
really don't win it that's gonna go in

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.650 
really don't win it that's gonna go in
the<00:02:44.720> margins<00:02:45.489> surgery<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:47.030> other<00:02:47.180> thing<00:02:47.510> they

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
the margins surgery the other thing they

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.290 
the margins surgery the other thing they
couldn't<00:02:47.930> treat<00:02:48.110> with<00:02:48.290> chemo<00:02:48.530> or<00:02:48.800> radiation

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
couldn't treat with chemo or radiation

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.240 
couldn't treat with chemo or radiation
because<00:02:50.300> she<00:02:50.810> had<00:02:51.050> a<00:02:51.349> glioma<00:02:51.739> roto<00:02:52.190> tumor

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
because she had a glioma roto tumor

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.580 
because she had a glioma roto tumor
so<00:02:53.450> basically<00:02:54.450> she<00:02:55.140> could<00:02:55.260> explain<00:02:55.500> this

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
so basically she could explain this

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.620 
so basically she could explain this
better<00:02:55.650> okay<00:02:58.280> she's<00:02:59.280> very<00:02:59.580> scientific<00:03:00.330> very

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
better okay she's very scientific very

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.220 
better okay she's very scientific very
scientific<00:03:01.170> this<00:03:01.890> is<00:03:02.670> a<00:03:03.150> anyway<00:03:03.930> basically

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
scientific this is a anyway basically

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.100 
scientific this is a anyway basically
the<00:03:05.130> cells<00:03:05.820> are<00:03:06.030> growing<00:03:06.120> from<00:03:06.390> glial<00:03:06.810> cells

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
the cells are growing from glial cells

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.010 
the cells are growing from glial cells
and<00:03:07.350> neuronal<00:03:08.040> cells<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.540> treat<00:03:09.780> one

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
and neuronal cells and you treat one

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.110 
and neuronal cells and you treat one
working<00:03:10.320> or<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.650> other<00:03:10.800> with<00:03:11.100> radiation<00:03:11.640> and

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
working or the other with radiation and

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.110 
working or the other with radiation and
if<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:13.020> treat<00:03:13.410> both<00:03:14.190> of<00:03:14.430> them<00:03:14.550> with<00:03:14.670> one<00:03:14.880> thing

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
if you treat both of them with one thing

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.540 
if you treat both of them with one thing
you'll<00:03:15.480> want<00:03:15.570> to<00:03:15.810> be<00:03:15.990> in<00:03:16.080> chemo<00:03:16.350> resistant<00:03:16.890> so

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
you'll want to be in chemo resistant so

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.420 
you'll want to be in chemo resistant so
it's<00:03:17.700> basically<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.360> death<00:03:18.690> sentence<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:19.920> we

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
it's basically a death sentence and we

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.030 
it's basically a death sentence and we
thought<00:03:20.820> first<00:03:21.720> of<00:03:21.870> all<00:03:22.050> I<00:03:22.260> wanted<00:03:22.830> her<00:03:22.980> to

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
thought first of all I wanted her to

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.430 
thought first of all I wanted her to
have<00:03:23.250> a<00:03:23.280> good<00:03:23.640> quality<00:03:23.820> of<00:03:24.150> life<00:03:24.330> that's<00:03:25.140> very

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
have a good quality of life that's very

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.060 
have a good quality of life that's very
important<00:03:25.920> to<00:03:26.010> me<00:03:26.160> and<00:03:26.400> I<00:03:27.390> knew<00:03:28.140> that<00:03:28.500> if<00:03:28.860> we

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
important to me and I knew that if we

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.970 
important to me and I knew that if we
can<00:03:29.280> just<00:03:29.489> get<00:03:30.209> her<00:03:30.420> on<00:03:30.450> track<00:03:30.870> with<00:03:31.200> nutrition

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
can just get her on track with nutrition

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.400 
can just get her on track with nutrition
which<00:03:32.310> she<00:03:32.489> was<00:03:32.640> really<00:03:33.030> lacking<00:03:33.330> in<00:03:33.660> I<00:03:33.930> knew

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
which she was really lacking in I knew

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.340 
which she was really lacking in I knew
we<00:03:34.650> could<00:03:34.830> really<00:03:35.190> make<00:03:35.340> some<00:03:35.700> headway<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:36.660> so

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
we could really make some headway and so

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.240 
we could really make some headway and so
let<00:03:37.739> me<00:03:37.830> tell<00:03:37.950> you<00:03:38.040> what<00:03:38.160> happened<00:03:38.840> we<00:03:40.250> took

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
let me tell you what happened we took

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.710 
let me tell you what happened we took

rid of the high fat diet she was

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.960

basically<00:04:28.290> eating<00:04:28.590> about<00:04:29.010> 90<00:04:29.340> grams<00:04:29.520> of<00:04:29.760> fat

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
basically eating about 90 grams of fat

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.900 
basically eating about 90 grams of fat
minimum<00:04:30.600> a<00:04:30.930> day<00:04:31.620> not<00:04:32.250> to<00:04:32.400> mention<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.760> high

protein
so<00:04:35.160> she<00:04:36.160> wasn't<00:04:36.370> able<00:04:36.640> to<00:04:36.790> heal<00:04:37.120> but<00:04:37.390> once<00:04:37.630> we

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
so she wasn't able to heal but once we

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.770 
so she wasn't able to heal but once we
stopped<00:04:38.170> that<00:04:38.410> and<00:04:38.710> that<00:04:38.890> was<00:04:39.070> two<00:04:39.580> years<00:04:39.850> next

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
stopped that and that was two years next

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.390 
stopped that and that was two years next
month

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
month

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.780 
month
the<00:04:42.400> last<00:04:42.610> MRI<00:04:42.880> we<00:04:43.150> went<00:04:43.390> to<00:04:43.600> to<00:04:44.410> get<00:04:44.560> she<00:04:45.220> had

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
the last MRI we went to to get she had

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.370 
the last MRI we went to to get she had
basically<00:04:46.030> it<00:04:46.570> had<00:04:46.720> stopped<00:04:46.930> growing

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
basically it had stopped growing

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.570 
basically it had stopped growing
so<00:04:47.500> she<00:04:47.560> was<00:04:47.800> technically<00:04:48.190> in<00:04:48.340> remission
