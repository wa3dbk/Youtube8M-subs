00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
 me 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.790
 of two hands of honda fire and friends e 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.440
 22 years the super sports car 45 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.150
 your appointment until the last show 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.820
 eicma di milano where it was presented 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.340
 this lesson is definitely super 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.590
 sport in particular modified a 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.900
 cycling level 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.750
 I arrived 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.829
 that at the level of mono rear are 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.809
 audience is true but they have been united 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.850
 that this bike in front 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.000
 the fork used in the championship 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.000
 world supersport behind the mono ttx 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.190
 then developed surely 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.580
 in addition to the tasks and the super-runs 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.930
 defined that not by chance 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.090
 we tried here on the curbs of 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.460
 vadena let's go together to find out how 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.460
 behaves this honda fireblade sp 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.290
 once in the lsp room we immediately notice one 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.780
 Triangulation saddle handlebars platforms not 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.250
 so slightly abundant push but 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.710
 this also depends on our height 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.420
 the rubber from 55 however lifts 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.159
 more the rear for 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.979
 a more loaded setting 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.570
 on the front the half handlebars are more 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.159
 open compared to the basic model is that 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.810
 even if the position leads from the real 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.860
 elbows more closed than rivals 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.860
 bmw and cannes 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.430
 incredibly quiet engine e 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.950
 linear followed almost old style 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.440
 linear and fluid as it prefers this 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.630
 four cylinders is not abrupt but one 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.560
 very strong back especially above 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.320
 9,000 rounds 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.720
 once this threshold is passed, it is unleashed 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.030
 a very good malice with its 180 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.840
 and more horses however controllable from 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.580
 right wrist 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.220
 and this is the beauty of the feeling 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.330
 perfect response control the gas 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.330
 from the rear 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.410
 the cyclists from the top this porcia she him 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.480
 state of the art you can warn 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.910
 work to perfection as well as every 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.910
 minimum variation of the mantle the wet e 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.250
 braking but free however is capable of 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.110
 absorbing every imperfection is a motorcycle 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.090
 precise as a laser seems to drive 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.240
 on tracks with stability 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.710
 incredible but also control 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.570
 liberation is true but fluidity 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.490
 of cycling education 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.980
 extremely precisely they sell the pilot 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.960
 real and absolute protagonist perhaps 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.910
 slightly slower on the descent 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.430
 in the fold compared to the opponents but 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.560
 this spa a sincere sliding bike 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.990
 clean a return to the future 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.970
 in short, the CBR 1000 spa shadows what we 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.890
 get in the saddle for the first time and after 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.140
 little seems to have guided her for years 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.630
 offers direct and immediate feedback 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.420
 thanks to a chassis and it hit us 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.880
 it is so much a clean communicative bike 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.950
 sharp but accommodating company 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.750
 true and sincere enter your symptoms 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.459
 you will discover a world every time 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.140
 you will face your very own 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.140
 challenge between the curves of a circuit
