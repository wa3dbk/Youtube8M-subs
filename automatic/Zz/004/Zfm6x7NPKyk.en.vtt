00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:04.060
 Today is a glorious day for our Sonic Hedgehog fans. 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.630
 The Sonic sprint has landed and it looks amazing! 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.320
 For those titles you just heard, the Sonic Sprint is a never-ending runner-up on the collapse and endless opinions. 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.909
 Developed by the glare studio. 

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:15.249
 Sonic sprints happen in the seaside mountains. One of the stages found 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:17.630
 Sonic adventure Sonic generation. 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.509
 How do you fold the game together? 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:21.949
 Let us... jump... straight 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.299
 As an endless runner, it's not in ugly to be inspired by Sonic's sprint. 

00:00:26.299 --> 00:00:28.769
 This game is in the style of "The Temple Run" - 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.329
 A 3D third person action game that uses tap water and swipe gestures to guide your hero. 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.790
 In fact, the sound waves are so incredibly good for this style of game, it is very difficult 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.180
 Imagine why SEGA waits 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.430
 This long time brought us such a title. 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.320
 Your little blue hedgehog is running, endless. 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.530
 Player swipe left and right change lane Sonic 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.070
 Stroke up so that the character jumps and swipes, not only causing sound waves 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.330
 Performing rolling maneuvers 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.440
 But it allows you to quickly return to a solid foundation if in the air. 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.500
 As all sonic titles, of course, you will collect rings when you go. 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.140
 This not only acts as a major currency game, but gives players exemptions 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.420
 Death, the obstacle you should run... 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.050
 ...own in all the auras at your cost. 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.840
 Sonic sprints "bank deposits" that require every stage of the game between players 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.180
 Characters that are not hit when upgrading. 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.890
 Interestingly, players have the choice to do this, not all 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.960
 Ring you have collected so far selected not to the bank, not one of the choices 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.619
 Alternative path. 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.209
 By doing this, you have a chance to get a reward ring and see different 

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:29.450
 Various games, such as Sonic's signature loop. 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.160
 In these chapters, the lens zooms in and gives more of the feel of the movie. 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.370
 Players can also operate Sonic in this part, although it's hard 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.750
 Look at what happened, it's still a good feeling, collecting a few rings 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.780
 The way forward. 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.230
 This is almost it. Run, as long as you can, jump, rotate and attack, and 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.740
 Collect the ring and energize. Like a magnet will temporarily make you endless runner staples 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.230
 Collect all the rings and you ran over without touching them. 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.090
 There are a few major differences between Sonic Sprint and its far away temple run. 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.810
 First of all, while this game is in line with the graphical temple run, Sonic sprints 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.100
 It seems to be much faster. 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.180
 From our little blue-haired friends, your sense of speed is quite good and 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.279
 The iconic Retina display looks amazing on the iPhone 5. 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:14.209
 With most endless runners, the game was heavily skewed to in-app purchases. 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.939
 No, you don't necessarily have two ring nets and spend your cash in the game. 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.740
 The second currency, Red Star, can earn again. 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.219
 Despite the slow speed, play through normal. 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:27.139
 Even unfortunate, especially the gaming industry and mobile games 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:30.129
 Heading this road, I generally don't have a problem with it. 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.219
 However, some games tend to feel a little bit heavy, almost exploited and 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:37.139
 Unfortunately, Sonic Dash is an exception. 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:40.639
 The cost of unlocking characters is quite high. You need to hit one 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.739
 A large number of formerly able to afford these without spending the real world 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.689
 World currency. Unfortunately, unlocking extra characters, nothing compares 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:49.599
 Change the hero of the skin. 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.149
 The game is exactly the same. 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:55.369
 The current game will issue some bonus stars here and there, but this seems to be 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:58.169
 Nothing is more than a mind washing technique - 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.669
 Let the player in these thought frames of shiny red stars not only be necessary, 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:03.549
 But rare, special. 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.089
 This relationship is largely related to my second complaint. 

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:09.229
 When the player dies, instead of spending a boost purchase 

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:12.819
 The main currency (such as running with the original temple allows you to do this), you now have 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.699
 There is an opportunity to continue to consume red stars that continue to be purchased. 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.290
 Unfortunately, let the players who spend a lot of cash quickly rise to 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.599
 On the top of the leaderboard, this gives me the next point for me. 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.849
 I hate to say this, but the feeling of danger in this game is unfair. 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.870
 You see, the level of design, or more specifically, the layout of the tracks 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.979
 Can... and... difficult. 

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:38.159
 This is a very common occurrence, you will find a pointed enemy 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:39.710
 Opposite side wall 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.470
 Or the wall beam segment packaging is closely linked, there is nothing to say about the player 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.809
 What can be done, in addition to the obstacles encountered, makes their run end. 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:49.869
 I am not saying that this is impossible, but it is extremely difficult - 

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:52.169
 This is not a casual runner. 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:55.829
 There are several game mechanics that are clearly not included in this tutorial. 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.279
 The first is that you need to cross the gaps and dashes 

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:01.589
 Attack the gap between sharks. 

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:05.180
 The game will tell you to jump, then click accordingly, but the speed you need, 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.319
 Understand and implement this move, 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.629
 Especially the first few times, very stupid. 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:13.949
 In addition, the ability to swipe down quickly back to the ground is not included. 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:17.739
 Believe me, this is very important. In those chapters that are tightly packed together, I mean the former. 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.999
 It will also always look good on tilting moving machinery more 0:04:21.999,0:04:26. ​​050 visceral experience, instead of constantly changing fixed lanes, 0:04:26. ​​050,0 :04:29.569 But in most cases, this does not hinder too much experience. 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.580
 Sonic sprint is a good game, no doubt - 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.770
 But it just feels real business. 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.080
 Make sure the company needs to make money, but considering this game will already 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.449
 Set you back to $1.99, 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:42.580
 It will always be happy to see that the game is a little more tolerant. 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.729
 Fans of sexual intercourse, and endless runner-style fans will find great enjoyment here. 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.629
 This game is universal, so it can run on iPad and iPhone. 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:52.520
 In the description below, there will be a link. 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.800
