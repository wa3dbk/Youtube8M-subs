00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello how good are I do not know if I tell you 

00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:07.080
 Welcome to this series in 2.0 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.050
 since the little that remains is not going to 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.640
 be in 2.0 why why has it been so 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.440
 smart to lose the file of 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.510
 video where I was recorded the last 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.310
 block of matches is worth recording it 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.140
 jerk it turns out that I lost it I erase it 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.210
 I imagine that unintentionally so 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.249
 unfortunately I do not have it but good 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.319
 At least I keep the recorded games 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:26.999
 of the fifa so I'm going to make a kind 

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:29.099
 of summary divided into two parts of the 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:31.439
 last games of the series 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.300
 we go with the first of these parts that 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.920
 they're going to be two pretty parties 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.540
 different among them you are going to see 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.430
 good first is an athletic one from madrid 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.110
 against the Munich bayern and well let's go 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.120
 to let us talk I'll leave you with 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.380
 a little the summary of what happened in the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.380
 first part there we go 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.989
 welcome here we are again for 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.989
 we are not going to talk 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.130
 play with mario gÃ³mez 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.690
 what a move could be dangerous 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.510
 you have to look for them 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.190
 in the room Antonio from here has been 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.100
 seen how he hurt his ankle 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.710
 but he has quickly reassured 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.990
 the bench had a shot 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.479
 the goalkeeper rejects and stops the semen 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.810
 keep playing thanks microphone 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.159
 wireless ton to wheel 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.159
 inside in danger zone 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.369
 connect with your partner 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.050
 the connection is completed to avoid 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.790
 support to continue looks like 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.710
 he will return later 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.490
 the attention that your position begins to 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.490
 be dangerous 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.979
 it can be yours put your head and to the 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.689
 final had to reach the goal because no 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.670
 there was more choice great center shot 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.170
 perfect nothing to object 10 and I 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.210
 frankly I did not know where I was going 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.979
 gave the air to see if espabila goes from one 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.800
 time 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:05.000
 I think the goalie is not always 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.000
 they have defended well 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.959
 as always it is interesting have 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:12.959
 preferred to clear 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.870
 is missing more and more near the goal 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:27.290
 rival 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:30.430
 fortune and beat on the head 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:35.290
 go cannon a very strong shot 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.290
 answered you are not alone 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.020
 the center is great 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.150
 I knew why 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.740
 and if as expected this game that 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.840
 we know that he rewards that he plays badly and in 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.660
 this case it was my turn to play fatal but 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.130
 in the end this draw came I'm not going to 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.930
 say no but good is the story and 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.220
 I feel with this game they promised me 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.050
 very happy with this undeserved tie 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.050
 however, here everything had not ended 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:18.040
 the pass can be dangerous 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:20.349
 and if I narrowly free a party 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.359
 he had to have lost 40 30 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.290
 easily tie it to 1 the same thing 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.239
 happened upside down a few 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.530
 episodes so this game and not 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.719
 we can do nothing to avoid it but 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.299
 good and for once it has been good for me 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:33.370
 so we're going to the next game and 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:38.370
 the easiest of all fifa history 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.370
 13 athletic of madrid against chelsea 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.290
 a very smart pass 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.849
 I touch the camera on goal 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.849
 and the doorman for 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.950
 and if it is exactly what you are 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.870
 thinking minute 8 of match and you lose 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.850
 the connection a moment of tension the 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.000
 victory was for him for me not what 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.250
 we knew but in the end as you can see 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.990
 game won to know if it was for a 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.210
 error of her servers for a 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.430
 error of your connection whatever but the 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.870
 case it is that he gave me the victory as I say 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.720
 the easiest victory in the history of 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.610
 fifa 13 and good a balm of 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.320
 quiet because I really needed 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.180
 these three points I do not like to win 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.160
 well but good and since they give me they do not 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.560
 I can say no, of course, because 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.290
 I do not have an option either, so we'll see each other 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.260
 in the last episode of this series that 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.610
 is no longer in 2.0 with the latest over 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.660
 last game you'll see soon 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.660
 see you later goodbye
