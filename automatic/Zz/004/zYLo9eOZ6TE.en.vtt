00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:15.550
 Today we are going to see hairstyles for 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.380
 short hair so let's start let's 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.740
 take a lock of hair from the side 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.230
 right and we're just going to go 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.140
 twisting we will also take from the 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.300
 degrees another strand we will go turning 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.039
 let's join with the list and we're going to 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.599
 take a last turn and then you're going to 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.880
 apply an entrepreneur brooch needs 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.280
 Something you like is very hairstyle 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.380
 simple and that's very bohemian that's left 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.410
 very good in both short hair and 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.410
 long 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.970
 the hairstyle 2 we're just going to start 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.650
 to make a French braid is to say no 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.780
 being able to because the hair is short not 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.250
 because with what comes to your shoulder 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.250
 you can return this braid 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.470
 Take your three hairs, take advantage 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.170
 to start from the neck and it's a list 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.270
 of three strands normal right in the middle 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.300
 left to the middle and you are feeding from 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.070
 both sides will be a little hair you put 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.070
 some pin and nothing happens 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.860
 at the end you can put some kind of 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.190
 Decoration much I like these 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.190
 little flowers 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.720
 and this is the end 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.840
 and the last hairstyle will be a semi-contracted 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.430
 with volume you will take a comb 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.220
 preference in baraka of having hair and 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.299
 the acp across the front of the 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.950
 hair and then spend about 2 million and 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.710
 you're going to start polishing when you 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.539
 have ready you are going to be like a trunk and 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.430
 it will be because they are pins and 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.290
 then you will grab the hair of 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.420
 in front of you that you have needed to 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.860
 complete your semi collected and you accommodate it 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.760
 as seen in the video that the form 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.000
 it is very nice something crossed and you can 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.070
 finish by applying some pins or 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.300
 a doll that you like or 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.600
 just pop and ask 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.420
 and preferably hairspray 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.060
 and it is semi-recumbent bulged very father 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.740
