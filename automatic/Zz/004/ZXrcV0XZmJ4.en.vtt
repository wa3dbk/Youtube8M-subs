00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
it's a 60 gallon air compressor tank and

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.609 
it's a 60 gallon air compressor tank and
a<00:00:15.960> 25<00:00:16.440> gallon<00:00:16.949> propane<00:00:17.190> tank<00:00:19.520> smokestacks<00:00:20.520> I

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
a 25 gallon propane tank smokestacks I

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.710 
a 25 gallon propane tank smokestacks I
wanted<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:23.000> mounted<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.119> propane<00:00:24.449> tank

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
wanted the mounted the propane tank

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.179 
wanted the mounted the propane tank
behind<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.320> smoke<00:00:25.500> tank<00:00:25.800> with<00:00:26.250> smoke<00:00:26.519> chamber

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
behind the smoke tank with smoke chamber

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:29.890 
behind the smoke tank with smoke chamber
being<00:00:28.789> a<00:00:28.849> little<00:00:28.939> bit<00:00:29.089> of<00:00:29.419> a<00:00:29.509> different<00:00:29.810> design

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
being a little bit of a different design

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.100 
being a little bit of a different design
then<00:00:30.349> I<00:00:30.880> started<00:00:31.880> out<00:00:32.029> with<00:00:32.180> but<00:00:32.480> it<00:00:32.570> seems<00:00:32.960> to

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
then I started out with but it seems to

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.790 
then I started out with but it seems to
work<00:00:33.140> though<00:00:33.500> so<00:00:37.690> then<00:00:38.690> smoke<00:00:38.989> chamber<00:00:39.199> the

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
work though so then smoke chamber the

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.399 
work though so then smoke chamber the
handle<00:00:41.230> counterweight<00:00:42.230> got<00:00:43.070> two

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:44.409 
handle counterweight got two

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:48.970 
handle counterweight got two
thermometers<00:00:45.409> on<00:00:45.860> here<00:00:47.500> so<00:00:48.500> I<00:00:48.559> can<00:00:48.710> make<00:00:48.949> sure

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
thermometers on here so I can make sure

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.530 
thermometers on here so I can make sure
the<00:00:49.190> temperature<00:00:49.339> is<00:00:49.579> even<00:00:49.760> dual<00:00:50.239> smoke

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
the temperature is even dual smoke

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.889 
the temperature is even dual smoke
stacks

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.340 

so<00:00:53.899> inside<00:00:55.780> totally<00:00:56.780> just<00:00:56.930> have<00:00:57.050> a<00:00:57.079> single

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
so inside totally just have a single

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.950 
so inside totally just have a single
great<00:00:57.680> right<00:00:57.890> now<00:00:58.070> what<00:00:58.910> I<00:00:59.030> plan<00:00:59.629> to<00:00:59.660> do<00:00:59.930> for

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
great right now what I plan to do for

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.410 
great right now what I plan to do for
modification<00:01:00.949> is<00:01:01.100> to<00:01:01.129> create<00:01:01.760> another<00:01:02.030> frame

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
modification is to create another frame

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.399 
modification is to create another frame
that<00:01:03.199> just<00:01:03.379> has<00:01:04.540> some<00:01:05.540> bar<00:01:05.750> coming<00:01:06.020> up<00:01:06.229> and

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
that just has some bar coming up and

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.050 
that just has some bar coming up and
across<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:06.680> top<00:01:06.830> that<00:01:07.040> I<00:01:07.220> can<00:01:07.369> hang<00:01:07.549> sausage

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
across the top that I can hang sausage

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.580 
across the top that I can hang sausage
and<00:01:08.540> wieners<00:01:08.869> from<00:01:09.170> for<00:01:09.950> roasting<00:01:11.590> that's

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
and wieners from for roasting that's

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:23.380 
and wieners from for roasting that's
basically<00:01:12.950> just<00:01:13.070> square<00:01:13.460> to<00:01:22.119> inside<00:01:23.119> you<00:01:23.270> can

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
basically just square to inside you can

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.639 
basically just square to inside you can
see<00:01:23.509> my<00:01:23.690> supports<00:01:24.200> for<00:01:24.409> the<00:01:24.500> roll<00:01:25.270> you<00:01:26.440> can<00:01:27.440> see

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
see my supports for the roll you can see

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.770 
see my supports for the roll you can see
the<00:01:27.770> smoke<00:01:28.539> tubes<00:01:29.539> coming<00:01:29.929> from<00:01:30.289> the<00:01:30.560> firebox

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
the smoke tubes coming from the firebox

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
that just to act as a heat sink and to

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.649 
that just to act as a heat sink and to
make<00:01:36.710> sure<00:01:36.830> that<00:01:36.979> nothing<00:01:37.190> drips<00:01:37.880> down<00:01:38.149> inside

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
make sure that nothing drips down inside

make sure that nothing drips down inside
of<00:01:38.810> those<00:01:38.899> tubes<00:01:40.119> you<00:01:41.119> can<00:01:41.179> see<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.630> smoke

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
of those tubes you can see the smoke

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.300 
of those tubes you can see the smoke
stacks<00:01:42.530> are<00:01:44.170> penetrating<00:01:45.170> a<00:01:45.289> little<00:01:45.500> bit<00:01:45.679> but

like a normal barbecue grill and I ended

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.400 
like a normal barbecue grill and I ended
up<00:02:16.870> having<00:02:17.739> to<00:02:17.980> adapt<00:02:18.250> that<00:02:18.989> to<00:02:19.989> put<00:02:20.200> four

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
casters on it it just got too heavy and

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.770 
casters on it it just got too heavy and
also<00:02:23.380> ended<00:02:23.650> up<00:02:23.739> pushing<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.910> two<00:02:25.090> legs<00:02:25.360> out<00:02:25.540> a

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
also ended up pushing the two legs out a

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.650 
also ended up pushing the two legs out a
little<00:02:25.959> bit<00:02:26.140> farther<00:02:26.319> to<00:02:26.650> be<00:02:26.739> under<00:02:26.980> that

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
little bit farther to be under that

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.059 
little bit farther to be under that
firebox<00:02:28.660> because<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.319> weight<00:02:29.470> was<00:02:29.709> too<00:02:29.890> heavy

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069

so<00:02:32.760> like<00:02:33.760> drew<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:33.970> bit<00:02:34.090> of<00:02:34.180> a<00:02:34.239> challenge<00:02:34.599> on

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
so like drew a bit of a challenge on

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.809 
so like drew a bit of a challenge on
this<00:02:35.160> partly<00:02:36.160> because<00:02:36.280> I<00:02:36.430> was<00:02:36.519> doing<00:02:36.760> it

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
this partly because I was doing it

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:37.410 
this partly because I was doing it
myself

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
myself

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.020 
myself
and<00:02:37.660> partly<00:02:38.410> because<00:02:38.560> I<00:02:38.830> tried<00:02:39.459> building<00:02:39.940> the

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
and partly because I tried building the

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.259 
and partly because I tried building the
legs<00:02:40.239> on<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.950> kind<00:02:41.950> of<00:02:42.160> a<00:02:42.340> chamber<00:02:42.849> rather

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
legs on to the kind of a chamber rather

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:44.789 
legs on to the kind of a chamber rather
than<00:02:43.540> building<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:43.900> legs<00:02:44.140> first<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.709> I'm

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
than building the legs first and I'm

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:52.070 
than building the legs first and I'm
just<00:02:45.010> setting<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.730> chamber

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.220 

my<00:02:52.710> events<00:02:53.130> on<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.400> smoke<00:02:53.640> chamber<00:02:54.140> kind<00:02:55.140> of

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
my events on the smoke chamber kind of

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.510 
my events on the smoke chamber kind of
came<00:02:55.380> up<00:02:55.500> with<00:02:55.590> a<00:02:55.650> simple<00:02:55.860> little<00:02:56.160> design

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
came up with a simple little design

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.800 
came up with a simple little design
where<00:02:56.820> I<00:02:56.850> basically<00:02:57.480> just<00:02:58.640> welded<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.850> little

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
where I basically just welded a little

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.650 
where I basically just welded a little
piece<00:03:01.050> of<00:03:02.180> half-inch<00:03:03.180> black<00:03:03.720> pipe<00:03:04.050> inside<00:03:04.650> and

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
piece of half-inch black pipe inside and

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.960 
piece of half-inch black pipe inside and
welded<00:03:06.660> a<00:03:06.810> half-inch<00:03:07.230> rod<00:03:07.520> onto<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.610> bottom

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
welded a half-inch rod onto the bottom

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.150 
welded a half-inch rod onto the bottom
and<00:03:09.330> that<00:03:09.420> just<00:03:09.660> simply<00:03:09.930> sits<00:03:10.200> in<00:03:10.320> there<00:03:10.470> and

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
and that just simply sits in there and

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.460 
and that just simply sits in there and
these<00:03:11.310> they<00:03:11.490> pivot<00:03:11.880> so<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.210> can<00:03:12.390> control<00:03:12.810> how

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
these they pivot so I can control how

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.120 
these they pivot so I can control how
much<00:03:13.620> that's<00:03:13.860> open<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:14.550> won't<00:03:14.700> tip<00:03:14.940> out<00:03:16.130> nice

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
much that's open and won't tip out nice

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.630 
much that's open and won't tip out nice
little<00:03:17.370> handle<00:03:17.610> on<00:03:17.670> there<00:03:17.820> to<00:03:17.910> keep<00:03:18.000> it<00:03:18.120> cool

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
little handle on there to keep it cool

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:26.000 
little handle on there to keep it cool
on<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:20.760> firebox<00:03:24.320> basically<00:03:25.320> this<00:03:25.530> is<00:03:25.650> 25

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
on the firebox basically this is 25

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.480 
on the firebox basically this is 25
pound<00:03:26.250> propane<00:03:26.430> tank<00:03:28.040> built<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.100> handle<00:03:29.400> off

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
pound propane tank built the handle off

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.760 
pound propane tank built the handle off
to<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.700> side<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:31.790> see<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.910> great<00:03:33.120> in<00:03:33.360> here

to the side you see the great in here

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.300 
to the side you see the great in here
there's<00:03:34.770> two<00:03:34.920> by<00:03:35.070> three<00:03:36.110> tubing<00:03:37.110> to<00:03:37.860> carry<00:03:38.100> the

there's two by three tubing to carry the

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.530 
there's two by three tubing to carry the
heat<00:03:38.520> and<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.850> smoke<00:03:39.030> into<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.360> smoke

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
heat and the smoke into the smoke

square<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.580> gain<00:03:50.330> support<00:03:51.330> I<00:03:52.170> have<00:03:52.950> an<00:03:53.040> ash

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
square to gain support I have an ash

horns<00:04:03.810> video<00:04:04.370> on<00:04:05.370> how<00:04:05.640> to<00:04:05.700> do<00:04:05.910> it<00:04:06.530> did<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.560> little

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
horns video on how to do it did a little

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.440 
horns video on how to do it did a little
bit<00:04:07.920> different<00:04:08.220> than<00:04:08.340> marked<00:04:08.580> it<00:04:08.700> in<00:04:08.820> his<00:04:09.060> he

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
bit different than marked it in his he

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.890 
bit different than marked it in his he
basically<00:04:09.810> I<00:04:10.320> think<00:04:10.709> he<00:04:10.860> had<00:04:10.980> a<00:04:11.010> similar

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
basically I think he had a similar

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.210 
basically I think he had a similar
connection<00:04:12.900> this<00:04:13.170> is<00:04:13.230> a<00:04:13.350> 25<00:04:13.770> pound<00:04:13.980> propane

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
connection this is a 25 pound propane

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.729 
connection this is a 25 pound propane
tank<00:04:14.700> so<00:04:14.850> it<00:04:14.940> had<00:04:15.120> a<00:04:15.150> 3/4<00:04:15.750> inch

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
tank so it had a 3/4 inch

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.060 
tank so it had a 3/4 inch
threading<00:04:17.430> on<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:17.669> top<00:04:17.910> and<00:04:18.320> I<00:04:19.320> just<00:04:19.709> welded<00:04:19.980> a

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
threading on the top and I just welded a

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.860 
threading on the top and I just welded a
nipple<00:04:20.400> on<00:04:20.520> to<00:04:20.640> that<00:04:20.790> so<00:04:20.940> I<00:04:21.000> had<00:04:21.150> three<00:04:21.570> quarter

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
nipple on to that so I had three quarter

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
nipple on to that so I had three quarter
inch<00:04:22.020> tubing<00:04:22.350> coming<00:04:23.070> in<00:04:23.310> on<00:04:23.880> both<00:04:24.120> ends

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
inch tubing coming in on both ends

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.110 
inch tubing coming in on both ends
whereas<00:04:25.890> mark<00:04:26.130> just<00:04:26.250> kind<00:04:26.460> of<00:04:26.490> routed<00:04:26.820> it<00:04:27.030> out

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
whereas mark just kind of routed it out

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.460 
whereas mark just kind of routed it out
so<00:04:27.300> he<00:04:27.419> could<00:04:27.570> send<00:04:27.720> a<00:04:27.840> pipe<00:04:28.050> all<00:04:28.230> the<00:04:28.260> way

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
so he could send a pipe all the way

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.860 
so he could send a pipe all the way
through<00:04:28.820> mark<00:04:29.820> had<00:04:29.940> a<00:04:29.970> better<00:04:30.180> idea<00:04:30.270> because

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
through mark had a better idea because

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.080 
through mark had a better idea because
this<00:04:30.990> really<00:04:31.169> limits<00:04:31.500> my<00:04:32.000> connectivity<00:04:35.090> so

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
this really limits my connectivity so

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.720 
this really limits my connectivity so
this<00:04:37.050> works<00:04:37.260> pretty<00:04:37.410> well<00:04:37.590> I<00:04:37.710> can<00:04:38.070> turn<00:04:38.220> it<00:04:38.310> on

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.480

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
and if drilling holes in the tube

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:57.909 
and if drilling holes in the tube
instead<00:04:44.940> of<00:04:45.120> coming<00:04:45.950> slices

I<00:05:06.790> really<00:05:07.150> have<00:05:07.240> too<00:05:07.330> many<00:05:07.419> holes<00:05:07.750> in<00:05:08.020> my<00:05:08.169> bore

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
I really have too many holes in my bore

I really have too many holes in my bore

on<00:05:13.330> these<00:05:13.419> holes<00:05:13.660> I<00:05:13.810> actually<00:05:13.960> get<00:05:14.229> a<00:05:14.440> little

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
on these holes I actually get a little

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.439 
on these holes I actually get a little
more<00:05:14.830> yellow<00:05:15.400> flame<00:05:15.820> which<00:05:16.030> is<00:05:16.060> what<00:05:16.300> you'd

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
more yellow flame which is what you'd

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.629 
more yellow flame which is what you'd
want<00:05:16.660> an<00:05:16.750> introspection<00:05:17.229> fire<00:05:17.530> so<00:05:17.919> I'll<00:05:18.520> just

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
want an introspection fire so I'll just

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.040 
want an introspection fire so I'll just
have<00:05:18.790> to<00:05:18.880> block<00:05:19.090> a<00:05:19.120> couple<00:05:19.360> use<00:05:19.600> holes<00:05:19.810> when<00:05:20.020> I

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
have to block a couple use holes when I

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.810 
have to block a couple use holes when I
actually<00:05:20.229> go<00:05:20.440> to<00:05:20.500> use<00:05:20.710> it<00:05:20.740> although<00:05:21.610> I<00:05:21.699> just

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
actually go to use it although I just

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.120 
actually go to use it although I just
thing<00:05:22.150> looks<00:05:22.330> like<00:05:22.510> it's<00:05:22.750> doing<00:05:23.620> exactly<00:05:23.740> what

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
thing looks like it's doing exactly what

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:30.629 
thing looks like it's doing exactly what
it's<00:05:24.250> intended<00:05:24.370> to<00:05:24.699> do<00:05:28.770> so<00:05:29.770> not<00:05:30.100> much<00:05:30.220> else<00:05:30.460> of

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
it's intended to do so not much else of

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:32.070 
it's intended to do so not much else of
note<00:05:30.669> on<00:05:31.150> the<00:05:31.300> firebox

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
note on the firebox

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.640 
note on the firebox
I<00:05:32.680> did<00:05:33.370> have<00:05:33.790> this<00:05:33.940> door<00:05:34.360> open<00:05:34.810> down<00:05:35.050> so<00:05:35.500> that

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
I did have this door open down so that

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.750 
I did have this door open down so that
it<00:05:35.889> I<00:05:36.130> can<00:05:36.880> have<00:05:37.030> a<00:05:37.090> more<00:05:37.330> compact<00:05:37.750> form<00:05:38.139> factor

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
it I can have a more compact form factor

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.100 
it I can have a more compact form factor
opening<00:05:39.760> away<00:05:39.970> from<00:05:40.270> the<00:05:40.450> main<00:05:40.960> smoke<00:05:41.260> box<00:05:41.560> I

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
opening away from the main smoke box I

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.950 
opening away from the main smoke box I
guess<00:05:44.110> the<00:05:44.200> other<00:05:44.290> damper<00:05:45.100> control<00:05:45.780> mark<00:05:46.780> had

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
guess the other damper control mark had

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.040 
guess the other damper control mark had
some<00:05:47.260> ideas<00:05:47.889> I'm<00:05:48.040> using<00:05:48.250> a<00:05:48.400> c-clamp<00:05:48.820> okay<00:05:49.810> I'll

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
some ideas I'm using a c-clamp okay I'll

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.650 
some ideas I'm using a c-clamp okay I'll
just<00:05:50.229> do<00:05:50.380> the<00:05:50.500> same<00:05:50.680> thing<00:05:51.270> this<00:05:52.270> design

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
just do the same thing this design

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.779 
just do the same thing this design
basically<00:05:53.050> just<00:05:53.260> really<00:05:53.800> uses<00:05:54.070> a<00:05:54.100> c-clamp<00:05:54.580> I

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:54.789 
basically just really uses a c-clamp I

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.050 
basically just really uses a c-clamp I
welded<00:05:55.150> it<00:05:55.270> directly<00:05:55.630> to<00:05:55.750> the<00:05:55.900> cap<00:05:56.169> and<00:05:56.820> I<00:05:57.820> can

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
welded it directly to the cap and I can

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.850 
welded it directly to the cap and I can
have<00:05:58.539> a<00:05:58.600> lot<00:05:58.750> of<00:05:58.780> finite<00:05:59.020> control<00:05:59.380> opening

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
have a lot of finite control opening

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.370 
have a lot of finite control opening
this<00:06:00.010> and<00:06:00.370> I'm<00:06:00.760> thinking<00:06:01.199> these<00:06:02.199> will

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
this and I'm thinking these will

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.810 
this and I'm thinking these will
probably<00:06:02.680> go<00:06:02.800> away<00:06:02.919> at<00:06:03.130> some<00:06:03.310> point<00:06:03.550> I'll<00:06:03.699> come

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
probably go away at some point I'll come

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.100 
probably go away at some point I'll come
up<00:06:03.910> with<00:06:03.940> a<00:06:04.060> different<00:06:04.360> design<00:06:04.449> it's<00:06:04.900> just<00:06:05.050> a

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
up with a different design it's just a

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.230 
up with a different design it's just a
little<00:06:05.320> tedious<00:06:05.500> to<00:06:05.919> just<00:06:06.760> sit<00:06:06.850> here<00:06:06.940> and<00:06:07.060> try

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
little tedious to just sit here and try

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.230 
little tedious to just sit here and try
and<00:06:07.360> open<00:06:07.450> these<00:06:07.780> by<00:06:08.020> cranking<00:06:08.470> them<00:06:08.530> out<00:06:09.210> so<00:06:10.210> I

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
and open these by cranking them out so I

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.310 
and open these by cranking them out so I
might<00:06:10.450> end<00:06:10.570> up<00:06:10.720> doing<00:06:11.020> something<00:06:11.200> a<00:06:11.289> little

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
might end up doing something a little

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.190 
might end up doing something a little
bit<00:06:11.470> different<00:06:11.860> but<00:06:12.010> they'll<00:06:12.280> work<00:06:12.310> I<00:06:13.210> haven't

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.200 
bit different but they'll work I haven't

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.590 
bit different but they'll work I haven't
done<00:06:14.350> a<00:06:14.410> burn<00:06:14.650> yet<00:06:14.889> so<00:06:15.250> haven't<00:06:16.180> had<00:06:16.300> to<00:06:16.389> really

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
done a burn yet so haven't had to really

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.400 
done a burn yet so haven't had to really
mess<00:06:16.750> with<00:06:16.900> them<00:06:17.050> but<00:06:18.479> they<00:06:19.479> work<00:06:19.630> okay<00:06:19.810> again

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.410 
mess with them but they work okay again

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.589 
mess with them but they work okay again
I'm<00:06:20.560> just<00:06:20.650> using<00:06:20.889> the<00:06:21.190> cut<00:06:21.760> out<00:06:21.910> that<00:06:22.210> I<00:06:22.270> used

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:22.599 
I'm just using the cut out that I used

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:25.140 
I'm just using the cut out that I used
when<00:06:22.780> I<00:06:22.840> cut<00:06:23.349> for<00:06:23.740> the<00:06:23.830> tube<00:06:24.039> flattened<00:06:24.940> it<00:06:25.060> out

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
when I cut for the tube flattened it out

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.310 
when I cut for the tube flattened it out
rounded<00:06:25.990> it<00:06:26.110> out<00:06:26.229> and<00:06:26.530> made<00:06:26.650> it<00:06:26.680> the<00:06:26.860> caf<00:06:28.320> again

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.320 
rounded it out and made it the caf again

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.350 
rounded it out and made it the caf again
you<00:06:29.470> can<00:06:29.590> see<00:06:29.710> the<00:06:29.800> caster's<00:06:30.280> here<00:06:30.729> had<00:06:31.330> to

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
you can see the caster's here had to

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.700 
you can see the caster's here had to
move<00:06:31.599> the<00:06:31.750> legs<00:06:31.960> out<00:06:32.200> do<00:06:32.470> a<00:06:32.500> little

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
move the legs out do a little

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.500 
move the legs out do a little
reinforcement<00:06:32.919> on<00:06:33.430> the<00:06:33.520> end<00:06:33.669> here<00:06:33.910> to<00:06:34.090> support

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:34.510 
reinforcement on the end here to support

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:38.010 
reinforcement on the end here to support
the<00:06:34.870> leg<00:06:35.470> weight<00:06:36.090> just<00:06:37.090> like<00:06:37.360> a<00:06:37.539> head<00:06:37.720> to<00:06:37.810> shim

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020 
the leg weight just like a head to shim

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.050 
the leg weight just like a head to shim
a<00:06:38.050> little<00:06:38.320> bit<00:06:38.470> but<00:06:38.820> otherwise<00:06:39.820> everything

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
a little bit but otherwise everything

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.870 
a little bit but otherwise everything
seems<00:06:40.630> to<00:06:40.720> be<00:06:41.200> in<00:06:41.830> good<00:06:41.950> shape<00:06:42.010> this<00:06:42.460> is<00:06:42.610> just<00:06:42.789> a

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 
seems to be in good shape this is just a

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.339 
seems to be in good shape this is just a
rough<00:06:43.060> coat<00:06:43.330> of<00:06:43.450> paint<00:06:43.599> on<00:06:43.780> here<00:06:44.020> right<00:06:44.169> now<00:06:44.320> I

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:44.349 
rough coat of paint on here right now I

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:46.770 
rough coat of paint on here right now I
still<00:06:44.680> have<00:06:44.770> to<00:06:45.099> do<00:06:45.820> a<00:06:45.849> couple<00:06:46.060> of<00:06:46.270> coats<00:06:46.450> with

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:46.780 
still have to do a couple of coats with

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:52.950 
still have to do a couple of coats with
the<00:06:47.820> brush<00:06:48.820> on<00:06:49.000> paint<00:06:49.360> the<00:06:49.570> high-temp

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.040 

again<00:06:53.960> back<00:06:54.170> on<00:06:54.290> the<00:06:54.410> front

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.050 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.330 

or<00:06:57.560> the<00:06:57.970> dual<00:06:58.970> thermometers<00:06:59.720> and<00:07:00.069> then<00:07:01.069> I<00:07:01.160> put

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:01.340 
or the dual thermometers and then I put

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:08.619 
or the dual thermometers and then I put
in<00:07:01.430> a<00:07:01.520> ball<00:07:05.169> flow<00:07:06.169> valve<00:07:06.440> to<00:07:06.949> clean<00:07:07.879> it<00:07:08.030> out<00:07:08.120> so

00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:08.629 
in a ball flow valve to clean it out so

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:10.960 
in a ball flow valve to clean it out so
close<00:07:09.259> that<00:07:09.319> when<00:07:09.650> I'm<00:07:09.770> smoking<00:07:10.250> and<00:07:10.490> can<00:07:10.759> open

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:10.970 
close that when I'm smoking and can open

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.219 
close that when I'm smoking and can open
it<00:07:11.060> when<00:07:11.150> they're<00:07:11.270> ready<00:07:11.419> to<00:07:11.479> clean<00:07:11.780> it<00:07:11.900> out<00:07:13.210> so

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:14.229 
it when they're ready to clean it out so

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:17.320 
it when they're ready to clean it out so
that's<00:07:15.229> it<00:07:15.560> this<00:07:15.800> is<00:07:15.860> all<00:07:16.129> again<00:07:16.699> inspired<00:07:17.180> by

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:17.330 
that's it this is all again inspired by
