00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
I wanted the kitchen to have a brick

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.510 
I wanted the kitchen to have a brick
wall<00:01:33.229> background<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.560> thought<00:01:35.009> we<00:01:35.159> really<00:01:35.189> nice

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
wall background I thought we really nice

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.830 
wall background I thought we really nice
to<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:35.939> open<00:01:36.060> brick<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.540> kitchen

is<00:01:36.990> although<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.680> don't<00:01:37.920> think<00:01:38.070> it's<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.520> most

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
is although I don't think it's the most

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.490 
is although I don't think it's the most
hygienic<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.659> have<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.990> kitchen<00:01:40.110> but<00:01:40.470> I

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
hygienic to have in the kitchen but I

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.109 
hygienic to have in the kitchen but I
always<00:01:40.860> think<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.310> looks<00:01:41.490> really<00:01:41.820> really

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
always think it looks really really

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.969 
always think it looks really really
awesome<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.930> went<00:01:43.380> ahead<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.680> put<00:01:43.829> that

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
awesome so I went ahead and put that

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.950 
awesome so I went ahead and put that
nice<00:01:44.220> brick<00:01:44.579> at<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.939> back<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.360> then

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
nice brick at the back and then

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.780 
nice brick at the back and then
definitely<00:01:46.740> went<00:01:47.280> with<00:01:47.369> white<00:01:47.579> kitchen

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790

definitely went with white kitchen
cabinets<00:01:48.329> it's<00:01:48.600> very<00:01:48.869> traditional<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.850> it's

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
brick that we have in the back as the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.300 
brick that we have in the back as the
same<00:02:09.899> brick<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.319> think<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:10.800> do<00:02:10.860> actually<00:02:11.220> go

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
same brick I think I do actually go

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.080 
same brick I think I do actually go
ahead<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.489> change<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:11.910> overall<00:02:12.239> but

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
ahead and change it overall but

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.300 
ahead and change it overall but
we<00:02:13.150> gave<00:02:13.269> them<00:02:13.420> up<00:02:13.569> gave<00:02:13.930> him<00:02:14.410> let's<00:02:14.980> say<00:02:15.129> him

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
we gave them up gave him let's say him

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.430 
we gave them up gave him let's say him
we<00:02:15.459> gave<00:02:15.610> him<00:02:15.790> a<00:02:15.970> breakfast<00:02:16.420> bar<00:02:16.599> right<00:02:17.260> in<00:02:17.290> the

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
we gave him a breakfast bar right in the

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.559 
we gave him a breakfast bar right in the
center<00:02:17.860> I<00:02:18.069> wanted<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:19.030> have<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:19.269> so<00:02:19.390> that<00:02:19.420> he

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
center I wanted to have it so that he

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.000 
center I wanted to have it so that he
could<00:02:19.690> sit<00:02:19.810> on<00:02:19.900> either<00:02:20.019> side<00:02:20.319> but<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.769> space

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
could sit on either side but the space

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.400 
could sit on either side but the space
is<00:02:21.040> really<00:02:21.430> cluttered<00:02:21.670> so<00:02:22.060> I<00:02:22.269> decided<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.290> just

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
is really cluttered so I decided to just

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.020 
is really cluttered so I decided to just
do<00:02:23.560> one<00:02:23.769> side<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.310> since<00:02:24.430> he's<00:02:24.580> living<00:02:24.819> on<00:02:24.879> his

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
do one side and since he's living on his

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.150 
do one side and since he's living on his
own<00:02:25.150> it<00:02:25.330> really<00:02:25.510> doesn't<00:02:25.810> matter<00:02:26.010> whether<00:02:27.010> he

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
own it really doesn't matter whether he

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.100 
own it really doesn't matter whether he
only<00:02:27.310> has<00:02:27.430> one<00:02:27.459> seat<00:02:28.060> or<00:02:28.209> not<00:02:28.390> in<00:02:28.629> the<00:02:28.959> living

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110

after shelf after shelf and this kind of

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.180 
after shelf after shelf and this kind of
reminded<00:02:53.140> me<00:02:53.170> of<00:02:53.230> that<00:02:53.349> so<00:02:53.680> I<00:02:53.709> thought<00:02:53.920> let<00:02:54.130> me

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
reminded me of that so I thought let me

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.920 
reminded me of that so I thought let me
incorporate<00:02:54.459> this<00:02:54.730> into<00:02:54.910> this<00:02:55.090> house<00:02:55.329> be

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
incorporate this into this house be

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.420 
incorporate this into this house be
really<00:02:56.200> nice<00:02:56.380> it<00:02:56.650> would<00:02:56.769> be<00:02:56.799> a<00:02:56.860> really<00:02:57.220> awesome

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
really nice it would be a really awesome

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.309 
really nice it would be a really awesome
feature<00:02:57.910> that<00:02:58.150> I<00:02:58.209> think<00:02:58.480> would<00:02:58.629> really<00:02:58.660> just

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
feature that I think would really just

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.690 
feature that I think would really just
bring<00:02:59.530> up<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.680> price<00:02:59.980> value<00:03:00.190> of<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:00.549> house

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
bring up the price value of the house

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.289 
bring up the price value of the house
and<00:03:01.200> make<00:03:02.200> it<00:03:02.410> worth<00:03:02.799> more<00:03:03.220> than<00:03:03.430> it<00:03:03.849> really<00:03:04.060> is

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
and make it worth more than it really is

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:05.400 
and make it worth more than it really is
because<00:03:04.510> it's<00:03:04.599> not<00:03:04.720> really<00:03:04.900> much<00:03:05.019> in<00:03:05.200> there

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
because it's not really much in there

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.770 
because it's not really much in there
we're<00:03:06.310> giving<00:03:06.519> it<00:03:06.640> some<00:03:06.819> kitchen<00:03:07.269> elements

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
we're giving it some kitchen elements

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.319 
we're giving it some kitchen elements
now<00:03:07.930> so<00:03:08.290> I'm<00:03:08.410> going<00:03:08.680> through<00:03:08.950> my

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
now so I'm going through my

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.729 
now so I'm going through my
