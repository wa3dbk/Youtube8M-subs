next<00:02:58.140> turn<00:02:58.320> actually<00:02:59.930> maybe<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:01.050> should<00:03:01.320> have

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
next turn actually maybe I should have

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:08.630 
next turn actually maybe I should have
done<00:03:01.530> that<00:03:02.540> I<00:03:04.010> think<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.100> should<00:03:05.340> have<00:03:07.520> you<00:03:08.520> know

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
done that I think I should have you know

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:24.080 
done that I think I should have you know
what<00:03:08.850> I'm<00:03:09.060> gonna<00:03:09.270> take<00:03:09.540> it<00:03:19.160> that<00:03:20.810> I<00:03:23.000> think<00:03:24.000> it

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
what I'm gonna take it that I think it

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.699 
what I'm gonna take it that I think it
was<00:03:24.209> better<00:03:24.390> not<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.690> Orlan<00:03:25.200> because<00:03:25.470> it's<00:03:25.620> a

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
was better not to Orlan because it's a

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.680 
was better not to Orlan because it's a
for<00:03:25.980> attack<00:03:26.670> creature<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.239> you<00:03:27.300> can't<00:03:27.510> deal

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
for attack creature and you can't deal

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.840 
for attack creature and you can't deal
with<00:03:27.840> it<00:03:27.989> yeah<00:03:28.980> it's<00:03:29.340> probably<00:03:29.580> better<00:03:29.730> off

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
with it yeah it's probably better off

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.330 
with it yeah it's probably better off
the<00:03:30.000> world<00:03:30.120> one
