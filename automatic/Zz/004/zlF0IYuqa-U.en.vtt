and i'm using the breville juicer i love
it<00:01:58.229> i<00:01:58.409> think<00:01:58.860> it's<00:01:59.040> an<00:01:59.189> awesome<00:01:59.369> juicer<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.270> used

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
it i think it's an awesome juicer I used

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.389 
it i think it's an awesome juicer I used
to<00:02:00.869> drink<00:02:01.049> green<00:02:01.320> smoothies<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.070> used<00:02:02.250> to

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
to drink green smoothies and I used to

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.340 
to drink green smoothies and I used to
blend<00:02:02.640> them

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
blend them

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.990 
blend them
the<00:02:03.650> ninja<00:02:04.750> ninja<00:02:05.750> blender<00:02:06.340> but<00:02:07.340> now<00:02:07.640> that<00:02:07.909> I'm

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
the ninja ninja blender but now that I'm

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.860 
the ninja ninja blender but now that I'm
juicing<00:02:08.539> I<00:02:08.979> definitely<00:02:10.060> feel<00:02:11.060> different<00:02:11.660> and

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
juicing I definitely feel different and

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.040 
juicing I definitely feel different and
it<00:02:12.830> definitely<00:02:13.040> tastes<00:02:13.910> different<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:14.989> I

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
it definitely tastes different and I

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.390 
it definitely tastes different and I
think<00:02:15.080> juicers<00:02:15.950> are<00:02:16.459> better<00:02:17.030> um<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:18.680> be<00:02:18.980> honest

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
think juicers are better um to be honest

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.300 
think juicers are better um to be honest
it<00:02:19.580> just<00:02:19.790> tastes<00:02:20.300> better<00:02:20.330> I<00:02:20.830> feel<00:02:21.830> like<00:02:22.010> it

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
it just tastes better I feel like it

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.670 
it just tastes better I feel like it
just<00:02:22.340> kind<00:02:22.819> of<00:02:22.940> gets<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.330> way<00:02:23.510> of<00:02:23.720> trying<00:02:24.110> to<00:02:24.319> go

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
just kind of gets a way of trying to go

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.040 
just kind of gets a way of trying to go
all<00:02:24.920> that<00:02:25.160> stuff<00:02:25.430> down<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:25.970> of<00:02:26.090> course<00:02:26.330> when

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
all that stuff down and of course when

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.620
