00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
confusing at first however it does you

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.060 
confusing at first however it does you
get<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.809> understand<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.410> after<00:00:49.680> playing<00:00:49.890> it

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070

for<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.250> while<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.300> top<00:00:51.510> here<00:00:51.719> we<00:00:51.840> have

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
for a while so the top here we have

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.010 
for a while so the top here we have
froze<00:00:52.710> gold<00:00:53.219> best<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.510> pause<00:00:54.719> button

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
froze gold best and the pause button

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.779

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
or this little green machine I guess I'm

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.070 
or this little green machine I guess I'm
a<00:01:10.140> genius<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.650> rhymes<00:01:10.970> so<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.900> little

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
to make the green thing blow up and then

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.899 
to make the green thing blow up and then
you<00:01:19.590> have<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.159> then<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.400> little<00:01:20.670> tunnel

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
person can walk through the tunnel then

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.899 
person can walk through the tunnel then
it's<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.350> end<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.590> level<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.460> let's<00:01:26.759> just

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.819 
the except the accelerometer so I decide
to<00:01:45.240> move<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.840> bombs<00:01:46.049> which<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.439> pretty<00:01:46.590> cool

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
to move the bombs which is pretty cool

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.190 
to move the bombs which is pretty cool
nice<00:01:47.490> little<00:01:47.670> add-on<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.240> as<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.960> can<00:01:49.020> see

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
nice little add-on that as you can see

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.450 
nice little add-on that as you can see
when<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.500> hit<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.740> green<00:01:49.890> things<00:01:50.159> they<00:01:50.310> turn

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
when you hit the green things they turn

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.969 
when you hit the green things they turn
into<00:01:50.610> light<00:01:50.880> green<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:52.680> start

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
into light green and the start

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.980 
into light green and the start
moving<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.579> then<00:01:54.119> obviously<00:01:54.270> we<00:01:54.509> can<00:01:54.810> just

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
moving and then obviously we can just

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.080 
moving and then obviously we can just
put<00:01:55.200> throw<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.920> bombs<00:01:56.130> onto<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.579> cogs<00:01:56.820> and

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
put throw the bombs onto the cogs and

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.910 
put throw the bombs onto the cogs and
then<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:57.990> will<00:01:58.079> do<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.290> pretty<00:01:58.590> much<00:01:58.710> by

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
then that will do it pretty much by

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.590 
then that will do it pretty much by
itself<00:01:59.159> then<00:01:59.490> obviously<00:01:59.759> unless<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.420> mess<00:02:00.570> up

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
itself then obviously unless you mess up

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.289 
itself then obviously unless you mess up
like<00:02:00.899> me<00:02:04.759> there's<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.790> little<00:02:05.909> fuse<00:02:06.180> on<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
like me there's a little fuse on the

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.429 
like me there's a little fuse on the
bomb<00:02:06.390> as<00:02:06.630> well<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.810> don't<00:02:06.990> if<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.110> guys<00:02:07.229> see

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
bomb as well I don't if you guys see

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.169 
bomb as well I don't if you guys see
that<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.829> when<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.280> fuse<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.729> goes<00:02:08.970> down

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
that and when the fuse that goes down

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.750 
that and when the fuse that goes down
I'll<00:02:09.330> see<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.539> bomb<00:02:09.690> blows<00:02:09.929> up<00:02:10.430> you<00:02:11.430> guys<00:02:11.550> see

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
I'll see the bomb blows up you guys see

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.680 
I'll see the bomb blows up you guys see
out<00:02:11.879> there

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
out there

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.570 
out there
let's<00:02:12.810> go<00:02:12.930> ahead<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:13.230> get<00:02:13.320> a<00:02:13.380> bomb<00:02:13.620> on<00:02:13.830> 28<00:02:14.220> cogs

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
let's go ahead and get a bomb on 28 cogs

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.150 
let's go ahead and get a bomb on 28 cogs
before<00:02:15.090> they<00:02:15.180> stop<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:19.590> that's<00:02:19.800> pretty<00:02:20.010> much

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
before they stop so that's pretty much

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.760 
before they stop so that's pretty much
by<00:02:20.310> itself<00:02:20.580> but<00:02:20.850> very<00:02:21.420> cool<00:02:21.720> game<00:02:21.900> guys<00:02:22.140> highly
