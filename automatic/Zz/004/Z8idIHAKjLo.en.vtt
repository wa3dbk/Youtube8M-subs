note<00:00:54.960> for<00:00:55.170> note<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.559> because<00:00:55.920> it's<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.550> hard<00:00:57.090> to

mainly<00:01:01.500> not<00:01:01.859> because<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.340> number<00:01:02.519> of<00:01:02.609> notes

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
mainly not because the number of notes

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.320 
mainly not because the number of notes
but<00:01:02.969> because<00:01:03.860> John<00:01:04.860> Bonham<00:01:05.250> plays<00:01:05.580> out<00:01:05.970> of

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
but because John Bonham plays out of

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.020

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.650 
plays thing to just feel good and sound
great<00:01:20.160> but<00:01:20.640> now<00:01:20.819> aren't<00:01:21.209> necessarily

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
great but now aren't necessarily

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.040 
great but now aren't necessarily
technically<00:01:22.590> 100%<00:01:23.280> correct<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.840> has

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
technically 100% correct so this has

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.630 
technically 100% correct so this has
been<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> real<00:01:25.440> challenge<00:01:25.470> for<00:01:25.890> me<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.340> try<00:01:26.610> and

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
been a real challenge for me to try and

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.690 
been a real challenge for me to try and
write<00:01:27.450> out<00:01:27.690> something<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.770> it's<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.520> as

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
write out something that it's that is as

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.660 
write out something that it's that is as
close<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.569> solo<00:01:30.780> as<00:01:30.959> possible<00:01:31.670> it's

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
close to the solo as possible it's

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.550 
close to the solo as possible it's
actually<00:01:33.000> impossible<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.750> notate<00:01:34.170> using

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
actually impossible to notate using

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.040 
actually impossible to notate using
actual<00:01:34.860> music<00:01:35.099> notation<00:01:35.869> exactly<00:01:36.869> why<00:01:36.989> you

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
actual music notation exactly why you

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.809 
actual music notation exactly why you
plays<00:01:37.410> unless<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.920> want<00:01:38.069> to<00:01:38.160> be<00:01:38.280> really

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
plays unless you want to be really

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:41.059 
plays unless you want to be really
really<00:01:39.060> really<00:01:39.509> complicated<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.830> what<00:01:40.979> I've

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:41.069 
really really complicated so what I've

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:43.279 
really really complicated so what I've
done<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.310> I've<00:01:41.670> given<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.450> exact<00:01:42.959> number

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
done is I've given you the exact number

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:45.740 
done is I've given you the exact number
of<00:01:43.410> notes<00:01:43.679> in<00:01:43.979> exactly<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.970> right<00:01:45.090> places<00:01:45.479> on

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
of notes in exactly the right places on

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.550 
of notes in exactly the right places on
the<00:01:45.840> drums<00:01:46.819> and<00:01:47.819> we<00:01:48.179> explain<00:01:48.599> it<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.989> how

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
the drums and we explain it to you how

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.639 
the drums and we explain it to you how
the<00:01:50.160> notation<00:01:50.880> I've<00:01:51.090> written<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:52.020> slightly

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
the notation I've written is slightly

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.380 
the notation I've written is slightly
different<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.979> how<00:01:53.129> we<00:01:53.190> actually<00:01:53.340> plays<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:54.000> so

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
different to how we actually plays it so

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.699 
different to how we actually plays it so
with<00:01:54.539> that<00:01:54.629> combination<00:01:54.929> at<00:01:55.349> the<00:01:55.410> end<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.619> it

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:55.709 
with that combination at the end of it

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:57.680 
with that combination at the end of it
you<00:01:55.800> should<00:01:55.890> be<00:01:56.160> able<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.429> play<00:01:57.090> note<00:01:57.539> from

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
you should be able to play note from

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.270 
you should be able to play note from
though<00:01:57.810> exactly<00:01:58.020> how<00:01:58.410> he<00:01:58.470> does<00:01:58.800> it<00:01:58.950> with<00:01:59.220> a

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
though exactly how he does it with a

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.949 
though exactly how he does it with a
little<00:01:59.489> bit<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.670> practice<00:01:59.849> listening<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.869> the

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:00.959 
little bit of practice listening to the

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:02.900 
little bit of practice listening to the
way<00:02:01.080> he<00:02:01.200> plays<00:02:01.440> it<00:02:01.619> as<00:02:01.739> well<00:02:01.979> it's<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.520> very<00:02:02.729> kind

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
way he plays it as well it's a very kind

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.969 
way he plays it as well it's a very kind
of<00:02:03.060> feeling<00:02:03.420> kind<00:02:03.599> of<00:02:03.810> thing<00:02:04.050> but<00:02:04.709> what<00:02:04.860> you're

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
of feeling kind of thing but what you're

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.589 
of feeling kind of thing but what you're
going<00:02:05.220> to<00:02:05.310> get<00:02:05.399> from<00:02:05.550> this<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.879> all<00:02:06.179> the<00:02:06.390> notes

00:02:06.589 --> 00:02:06.599 
going to get from this is all the notes

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:08.869 
going to get from this is all the notes
ended<00:02:07.050> up<00:02:07.140> in<00:02:07.289> the<00:02:07.379> correct<00:02:07.560> order<00:02:07.830> but<00:02:08.729> not
