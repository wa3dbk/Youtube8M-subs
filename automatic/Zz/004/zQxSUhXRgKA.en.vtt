00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.110
 I know I and just hit them 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.279
 with 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:10.480
 if you want to set up in a greenhouse, you need that 

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:12.210
 mindful 8 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.149
 strict requirements 

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:16.169
 going into greenhouse paper 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:19.169
 and to be able to adjust that 6 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:21.919
 to begin 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:26.150
 Harry bush ice upside down and I have several colors on it at the same time 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.019
 iron 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.019
 I choose you get two colors 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.930
 so I'm also on the pier with his restaurant 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.470
 and brings out had gone on the paper 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.320
 in addition, various techniques can be used 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.450
 for example, next week 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.450
 as you see with the classic as a matter of course 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.430
 that for example 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.430
 to be busy 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.350
 for example by the hairdresser 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.350
 so lift the iron 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.570
 then the most beautiful creations 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.230
 you can make a line by using the iron sector 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.970
 some flowers 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.670
 also interacted, for example 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.670
 create artwork 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.870
 if you are not satisfied you can always go again 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:12.899
 painting a grenade again and again 

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:15.899
 close to the wash 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:19.759
 optionally you can color 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:23.899
 if you have used pain as pain 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:29.289
 add some extra details 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:40.929
 like anything possible 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:47.219
 more different tools that you can use 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:51.449
 this is the steel 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:53.079
 because the rpm 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.109
 as you can see a happy ing 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.109
 nizar cupboard where the booty was on 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:01.719
 you can write and draw on this 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:10.589
 you can add extra details 

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:13.589
 but I can still make it difficult 

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:41.720
 and also strengthen 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.720
 all kinds of different attachments 

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:48.839
 bear burdens due to the suspension 

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:53.439
 you can replace signs at twente with, for example, the circle 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:56.439
 and thereby apply as in 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.079
 also by a little bit on your own 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.989
 and here a smaller version 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.599
 so there are many more attachments 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.709
 the nice thing about stijn parties is that you handle it 

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:19.090
 can pick up at 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.090
 if you iron this orbit this falls 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:26.370
 6 I get you and like from mini complete 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:33.509
 with it you can do anything again 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.009
 I found demanded the silver 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:43.319
 and just call extra cards 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:46.319
 year card 

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:51.309
 therefore your card must be more expressive 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:00.779
 by sliding it curved over the ice 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.580
 arises 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.580
 silvercare 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:15.009
 in addition, you also have for example 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:16.180
 a writer 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.400
 but the medal was switch away 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.400
 thus giving you even more 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:30.199
 can make details 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.499
 well if you are satisfied 

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:38.499
 pack it in chili 

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:41.499
 fetsie painting o 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:47.629
 then the color comes out even more intensively 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:55.099
 the minimap suffered 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:58.099
 has many more options 

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:04.089
 I'll show you one more 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:10.069
 by and I become emperor like old paper directly in the attic 

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:16.619
 so that you can start using beeswax immediately 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:27.270
 receive the dress scraps 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.270
 as scripture criticism 

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:34.999
 by using different colors 

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:46.999
 also the most beautiful creations arise 

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:05.400
 as you can see 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.819
 dry it in no time 

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:10.819
 ok very suitable for children 

00:07:13.339 --> 00:07:16.339
 yet it stands as it were 

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:19.759
 you get very beautiful creations 

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:21.509
 it is dry 

00:07:21.509 --> 00:07:23.759
 further a light on 

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:26.759
 caroline can take time 

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:32.259
 and this is the end result 

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:36.050
 also have a look on my website www.schillertheater.nl 

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:36.889
 refuse 

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:38.059
 much more 

00:07:38.059 --> 00:07:40.289
 example and inspiration 

00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:41.999
 I hope you 

00:07:41.999 --> 00:07:43.789
 got the inspiration from
