need it but I just felt like being a
little<00:03:36.310> bit<00:03:36.580> extra<00:03:36.970> so<00:03:37.390> I<00:03:37.690> twist<00:03:38.200> apart<00:03:38.650> in

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
little bit extra so I twist apart in

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.890 
little bit extra so I twist apart in
space<00:03:38.920> and<00:03:39.400> I<00:03:39.490> like<00:03:39.700> how<00:03:39.880> it<00:03:40.090> came<00:03:40.270> out<00:03:40.540> I<00:03:40.570> think

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
space and I like how it came out I think

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.350 
space and I like how it came out I think
it<00:03:40.990> came<00:03:41.140> out<00:03:41.200> really<00:03:41.440> nice<00:03:41.950> this<00:03:42.910> unit<00:03:43.270> is

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
it came out really nice this unit is

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.650 
it came out really nice this unit is
like<00:03:43.600> eight<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:44.560> ten<00:03:44.860> inches<00:03:44.890> all<00:03:45.700> around<00:03:45.760> it

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
like eight to ten inches all around it

00:03:46.660 --> 00:04:01.500 
like eight to ten inches all around it
has<00:03:46.900> really<00:03:47.350> nice<00:03:47.590> layers<00:03:59.610> is<00:04:00.610> like<00:04:00.940> a<00:04:01.150> wavy

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
has really nice layers is like a wavy

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.640 
has really nice layers is like a wavy
texture<00:04:02.140> and<00:04:02.980> it's<00:04:03.850> not<00:04:04.240> really<00:04:04.900> silky<00:04:05.290> but

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
texture and it's not really silky but

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.670 
texture and it's not really silky but
it's<00:04:05.830> not<00:04:06.010> yucky<00:04:06.370> either<00:04:07.050> so<00:04:08.050> that<00:04:08.080> is<00:04:08.500> your

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
it's not yucky either so that is your

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.430 
it's not yucky either so that is your
close-up<00:04:09.190> on<00:04:09.370> the<00:04:09.490> texture<00:04:09.880> I<00:04:10.360> think<00:04:11.110> it<00:04:11.260> is<00:04:11.410> a

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
close-up on the texture I think it is a

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.950 
close-up on the texture I think it is a
really<00:04:12.040> really<00:04:12.190> nice<00:04:12.460> texture<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.540> luster<00:04:13.930> on

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
really really nice texture the luster on

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.170 
really really nice texture the luster on
each<00:04:14.230> unit<00:04:14.470> is<00:04:14.770> like<00:04:14.980> a<00:04:15.190> medium<00:04:15.490> luster<00:04:16.150> I

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
each unit is like a medium luster I

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.990 
each unit is like a medium luster I
think<00:04:16.630> it<00:04:16.750> is<00:04:16.900> a<00:04:16.930> really<00:04:17.350> natural<00:04:17.820> you<00:04:18.820> don't

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
think it is a really natural you don't

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.820 
think it is a really natural you don't
need<00:04:19.180> any<00:04:19.390> powder<00:04:19.780> or<00:04:20.109> anything<00:04:20.410> like<00:04:20.770> that

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
you just can spritz it with a little bit

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.720 
you just can spritz it with a little bit

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
a medium to a folder density and I

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.420 
a medium to a folder density and I
really<00:04:37.870> love<00:04:38.080> that<00:04:38.350> even<00:04:38.860> though<00:04:39.100> I<00:04:39.130> did

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
really love that even though I did

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.760 
really love that even though I did
manipulate<00:04:40.060> the<00:04:40.210> part<00:04:40.480> in<00:04:40.570> space<00:04:40.870> and<00:04:41.200> tweeze

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
manipulate the part in space and tweeze

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:42.390 
manipulate the part in space and tweeze
it

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
it

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.390 
it
did<00:04:42.550> not<00:04:42.729> get<00:04:43.600> much<00:04:44.020> shedding<00:04:44.590> at<00:04:44.740> all<00:04:44.979> and<00:04:45.340> I

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
did not get much shedding at all and I

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.980 
did not get much shedding at all and I
don't<00:04:45.460> expect<00:04:45.850> it<00:04:46.270> to<00:04:46.300> have<00:04:46.660> a<00:04:46.690> lot<00:04:46.930> of

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
don't expect it to have a lot of

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.040 
don't expect it to have a lot of
shedding<00:04:47.380> because<00:04:47.650> this<00:04:48.580> is<00:04:48.880> a<00:04:48.910> short<00:04:49.060> unit<00:04:49.810> so

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
shedding because this is a short unit so

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.120 
shedding because this is a short unit so
you<00:04:50.080> don't<00:04:50.350> really<00:04:50.470> have<00:04:50.650> to<00:04:50.800> worry<00:04:50.979> about

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
you don't really have to worry about

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.480 
you don't really have to worry about
much<00:04:51.820> shedding<00:04:52.449> or<00:04:52.690> tangling<00:04:53.650> with<00:04:53.830> shorter
