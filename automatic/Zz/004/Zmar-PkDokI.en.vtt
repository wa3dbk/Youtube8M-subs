00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
much chromosome damage but we found

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.839 
much chromosome damage but we found
something<00:01:41.179> else<00:01:41.770> in<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.979> stomach<00:01:43.459> of<00:01:43.670> that

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
but this one anyway had apparently eaten

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.510

we<00:02:06.410> removed<00:02:06.800> him<00:02:07.180> yes<00:02:08.180> the<00:02:08.390> creature<00:02:08.600> was

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
we removed him yes the creature was

mailed from the stomach for further

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.540 
mailed from the stomach for further
study<00:02:11.380> then<00:02:12.380> I<00:02:12.410> decided<00:02:12.950> that<00:02:13.100> we<00:02:13.340> would

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
study then I decided that we would

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.180 
study then I decided that we would
extract<00:02:13.970> a<00:02:14.150> sperm<00:02:14.510> specimen<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.770> attempt

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
extract a sperm specimen and attempt

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.590 
extract a sperm specimen and attempt
fertilization

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
fertilization

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.990

using<00:02:18.170> my<00:02:18.410> or<00:02:18.800> from<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.850> in<00:02:20.210> my<00:02:20.690> room<00:02:20.750> I

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
using my or from and in my room I

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.950 
using my or from and in my room I
decided<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.720> give<00:02:23.930> birth<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.590> a<00:02:24.620> hybrid<00:02:25.220> child

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960

fathered by this rumored human the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.410 
fathered by this rumored human the
fertilization<00:02:30.470> was<00:02:30.680> successful<00:02:31.460> but<00:02:32.270> the

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
fertilization was successful but the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.330 
fertilization was successful but the
embryo<00:02:32.870> developed<00:02:33.470> without<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:33.920> trace<00:02:34.310> of
