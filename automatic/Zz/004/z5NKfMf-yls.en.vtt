that so move that to a cold burner and
let<00:02:05.660> this<00:02:05.780> cool<00:02:06.290> down<00:02:06.530> to<00:02:06.770> room<00:02:06.800> temperature

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
let this cool down to room temperature

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:13.210 
let this cool down to room temperature
and<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:08.060> water<00:02:09.040> the<00:02:10.040> yeast<00:02:10.250> cake<00:02:10.520> here<00:02:12.220> and

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
and the water the yeast cake here and

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.540 
and the water the yeast cake here and
I'm<00:02:13.580> just<00:02:13.730> going<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.770> swirl<00:02:15.770> it<00:02:15.830> around<00:02:16.040> for<00:02:16.520> a

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
I'm just going to swirl it around for a

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.240 
I'm just going to swirl it around for a
minute<00:02:16.850> or<00:02:16.970> two<00:02:17.590> all<00:02:18.590> right<00:02:18.620> so<00:02:18.890> if<00:02:18.950> you<00:02:19.010> had<00:02:19.160> a

minute or two all right so if you had a

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:28.860 
minute or two all right so if you had a
good<00:02:19.459> swirl<00:02:19.730> here<00:02:20.120> I'm<00:02:20.480> gonna<00:02:20.709> add<00:02:21.709> it<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:21.980> the

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.440 

so<00:02:29.870> that's<00:02:30.020> where<00:02:30.200> my<00:02:30.850> this<00:02:31.850> third<00:02:32.180> plague

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
so that's where my this third plague

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.710 
so that's where my this third plague
went<00:02:33.130> all<00:02:34.130> right<00:02:34.280> so<00:02:35.320> dump<00:02:36.320> all<00:02:36.470> of<00:02:36.560> these<00:02:36.710> out

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
went all right so dump all of these out

okay<00:02:43.820> so<00:02:43.880> we've<00:02:44.210> had<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:45.010> mason<00:02:46.010> jars<00:02:46.250> in<00:02:46.430> the

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
okay so we've had the mason jars in the

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.790 
okay so we've had the mason jars in the
fridge<00:02:46.820> for<00:02:46.850> a<00:02:47.210> little<00:02:47.540> while<00:02:47.720> it's<00:02:48.500> called

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
fridge for a little while it's called

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.310 
fridge for a little while it's called
cold<00:02:49.100> crashing<00:02:49.670> since<00:02:50.510> this<00:02:50.600> is<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.990> summer

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
cold crashing since this is the summer

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.040 
cold crashing since this is the summer
it's<00:02:52.100> just<00:02:52.340> too<00:02:52.490> hot<00:02:52.670> in<00:02:52.820> here<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.210> wait<00:02:53.810> for

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
it's just too hot in here to wait for

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.770 
it's just too hot in here to wait for
them<00:02:54.140> to<00:02:54.170> do<00:02:54.320> it<00:02:54.410> at<00:02:54.500> room<00:02:54.680> temperature<00:02:55.220> so<00:02:55.490> you

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
them to do it at room temperature so you

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.670 
them to do it at room temperature so you
can<00:02:56.780> always<00:02:56.900> just<00:02:56.990> throw<00:02:57.260> them<00:02:57.380> in<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.500> fridge

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
can always just throw them in the fridge

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.560 
can always just throw them in the fridge
if<00:02:57.860> you<00:02:57.980> want<00:02:58.160> now<00:02:58.910> as<00:02:58.970> you<00:02:59.090> can<00:02:59.210> see<00:02:59.330> you<00:02:59.450> can

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
if you want now as you can see you can

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.090 
if you want now as you can see you can
almost<00:02:59.690> make<00:03:00.700> out<00:03:01.700> three<00:03:02.360> distinct<00:03:03.140> colors

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
almost make out three distinct colors

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.970 
almost make out three distinct colors
like<00:03:04.310> almost<00:03:04.460> like<00:03:04.610> a<00:03:04.670> beer<00:03:05.210> parfait<00:03:05.950> like<00:03:06.950> a

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
like almost like a beer parfait like a

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.800 
like almost like a beer parfait like a
light<00:03:07.250> color<00:03:07.520> up<00:03:07.730> here<00:03:08.090> you<00:03:08.510> know<00:03:08.600> a<00:03:08.630> little

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
light color up here you know a little

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.990 
light color up here you know a little
bit<00:03:08.930> darker<00:03:09.380> right<00:03:09.590> here<00:03:09.920> and<00:03:10.040> then<00:03:10.160> you<00:03:10.970> have

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
bit darker right here and then you have

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.100 
bit darker right here and then you have
your<00:03:11.500> looks<00:03:12.500> like<00:03:12.650> you<00:03:12.860> know<00:03:12.950> hop<00:03:13.280> sediment

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
your looks like you know hop sediment

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.650 
your looks like you know hop sediment
settles<00:03:15.110> at<00:03:15.350> the<00:03:15.440> bottle<00:03:15.770> bottom<00:03:16.250> there<00:03:16.660> so

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
settles at the bottle bottom there so

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.120 
settles at the bottle bottom there so
what<00:03:17.840> we're<00:03:17.930> going<00:03:18.050> to<00:03:18.230> do<00:03:18.440> is<00:03:18.680> this<00:03:18.890> is<00:03:18.950> the

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
what we're going to do is this is the

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.300 
what we're going to do is this is the
yeast<00:03:19.490> right<00:03:19.760> here<00:03:20.000> at<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.210> top<00:03:21.190> we're<00:03:22.190> going

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
yeast right here at the top we're going

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.460 
yeast right here at the top we're going
to<00:03:22.370> do<00:03:22.520> is<00:03:22.700> pour<00:03:23.200> two<00:03:24.200> bottles<00:03:24.740> into<00:03:25.100> an<00:03:25.460> empty

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
to do is pour two bottles into an empty

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.930 
to do is pour two bottles into an empty
mason<00:03:27.470> jar<00:03:27.740> some<00:03:28.430> of<00:03:28.520> their<00:03:28.640> new<00:03:28.760> is<00:03:28.910> just

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
mason jar some of their new is just

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:36.390 
mason jar some of their new is just
basically<00:03:30.250> very<00:03:31.250> gently<00:03:31.820> for<00:03:34.300> just<00:03:35.300> the<00:03:35.480> yeast

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
basically very gently for just the yeast

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.880 
basically very gently for just the yeast
into<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.550> mason<00:03:37.940> jar<00:03:38.380> it's<00:03:39.380> hard<00:03:39.590> to<00:03:39.680> tell

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
into the mason jar it's hard to tell

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.030 
into the mason jar it's hard to tell
when<00:03:40.130> you're<00:03:40.250> pouring<00:03:40.550> it<00:03:41.650> if<00:03:42.650> you<00:03:42.800> want<00:03:42.980> to

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
when you're pouring it if you want to

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.530 
when you're pouring it if you want to
err<00:03:43.190> on<00:03:43.459> the<00:03:43.520> side<00:03:43.760> of<00:03:43.820> caution<00:03:43.940> you<00:03:44.390> can

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
err on the side of caution you can

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.990 
err on the side of caution you can
always<00:03:44.630> pour<00:03:44.990> try<00:03:45.830> better<00:03:46.070> to<00:03:46.459> pour<00:03:46.700> less

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
always pour try better to pour less

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.940 
always pour try better to pour less
yeast<00:03:48.520> but<00:03:49.630> sediment<00:03:50.630> I<00:03:50.720> should<00:03:50.930> say<00:03:51.140> it's

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
yeast but sediment I should say it's

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.020 
yeast but sediment I should say it's
kind<00:03:52.130> of<00:03:52.160> like<00:03:52.280> that<00:03:52.430> like<00:03:52.640> I<00:03:52.730> said<00:03:52.760> it's<00:03:53.000> like

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
kind of like that like I said it's like

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.100 
kind of like that like I said it's like
a<00:03:53.180> parfait<00:03:53.420> I<00:03:53.690> know

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
a parfait I know

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.710 
a parfait I know
I<00:03:54.350> also<00:03:55.040> recommend<00:03:55.400> doing<00:03:55.670> this<00:03:55.850> over

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
I also recommend doing this over

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.190 
I also recommend doing this over
towel<00:03:57.290> because<00:03:57.710> you're<00:03:57.890> deaf<00:03:58.040> Waco<00:03:58.370> spill<00:03:59.200> it

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
towel because you're deaf Waco spill it

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.040 
towel because you're deaf Waco spill it
looks<00:04:00.380> like<00:04:00.500> I'll<00:04:00.620> be<00:04:00.770> able<00:04:00.800> to<00:04:00.950> get<00:04:01.600> all<00:04:02.600> four

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
looks like I'll be able to get all four

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.440 
looks like I'll be able to get all four
jars<00:04:04.570> into<00:04:05.570> one<00:04:05.780> jar<00:04:06.880> that's<00:04:07.880> pretty<00:04:08.150> much<00:04:08.270> all

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
jars into one jar that's pretty much all

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.170 
jars into one jar that's pretty much all
I<00:04:08.510> need<00:04:08.780> anyways<00:04:11.050> we're<00:04:12.050> gonna<00:04:12.940> take<00:04:13.940> one<00:04:14.150> of

stick<00:04:20.299> this<00:04:20.420> in<00:04:20.600> the<00:04:20.690> fridge<00:04:20.720> you'll<00:04:21.110> slap<00:04:21.410> a

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
stick this in the fridge you'll slap a

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.740 
stick this in the fridge you'll slap a
label<00:04:21.709> on<00:04:21.980> it<00:04:22.130> with<00:04:22.280> some<00:04:22.310> duct<00:04:23.270> tape<00:04:23.390> or
