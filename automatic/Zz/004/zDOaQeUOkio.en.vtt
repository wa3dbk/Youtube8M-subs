00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.860
I am worried about a long time how I say to you

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:35.920
Just time goes by, maybe

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.500
You are busy a little. You don't reply yet

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.100
I wait your text message all day long

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:57.940
Maybe you don't like my words that I send to you

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.100
You don't reply yet

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.620
I don't know your feeling today. Oh

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.140
Can you feel my mind of forcing smile

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.400
You don't answer, well

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.980
It may be just me today

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.520
Do you worried about me, too?

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.980
You don't reply again

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.980
Perhaps you are kidding. Oh

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.080
I want to ask that you like me or not

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.580
Don't you know or try to read my mind?

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.100
I don't know your mind. Don't you like me?

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.920
Why are you trying to plow around me

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.280
Will I say frankly?

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.780
Don't you know my heart pounding?

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.620
I don't know your feeling today

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.060
Can you feel my mind of forcing smile

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.980
You don't answer, well

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.760
It may be just me today

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.040
Do you worried about me, too?

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.540
You don't reply again

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.180
Honestly saying

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.280
My heart is pounding again and again

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.680
Is this love?

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.020
Is your feeling the same as mine?

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.940
I wonder about your feeling

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.380
I'm not kidding

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.580
You confuse me

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.300
It's strange or I made a mistake

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.600
Do you worried about me, too?

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.220
You don't reply again

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.520
Perhaps you are kidding

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.080
I want to ask that you like me or not

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.300
Don't you know or try to read my mind?
