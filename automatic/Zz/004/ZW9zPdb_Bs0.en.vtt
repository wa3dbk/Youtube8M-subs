vector into a suitable host the process

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.830 
vector into a suitable host the process
is<00:01:03.660> called<00:01:03.840> as<00:01:04.049> transformation<00:01:05.570> we<00:01:06.570> need<00:01:06.720> to

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
is called as transformation we need to

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.899 
is called as transformation we need to
select<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.530> transformed<00:01:08.189> host<00:01:08.460> cell<00:01:08.700> and

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
select the transformed host cell and

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.600 
select the transformed host cell and
finally<00:01:09.510> our<00:01:09.750> indention<00:01:10.490> multiplication<00:01:11.490> our

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
finally our indention multiplication our

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.090 
finally our indention multiplication our
expression<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.900> introduced<00:01:13.380> gene<00:01:13.650> inside

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100

expression of the introduced gene inside
the<00:01:14.250> host<00:01:15.500> so<00:01:16.500> let<00:01:16.650> us<00:01:16.770> move<00:01:16.979> into<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.580> first

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
the host so let us move into the first

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.030 
the host so let us move into the first
step<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.960> identification<00:01:19.830> and

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
step that is identification and

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.660 
step that is identification and

bacteria this is a coli bacterium I have

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.350 
bacteria this is a coli bacterium I have

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
interest that is a human insulin gene so

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.190 
interest that is a human insulin gene so
first<00:03:09.620> of<00:03:09.770> all<00:03:09.980> we<00:03:10.670> need<00:03:10.880> to<00:03:10.940> make<00:03:11.090> a<00:03:11.540> cut<00:03:11.960> in

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
first of all we need to make a cut in

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.310 
first of all we need to make a cut in
the<00:03:12.470> vector<00:03:12.680> using<00:03:13.130> a<00:03:13.400> restriction<00:03:13.730> enzyme

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
the vector using a restriction enzyme

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.600 
the vector using a restriction enzyme
resolution<00:03:15.320> enzymes<00:03:15.680> are<00:03:15.920> enzymes<00:03:16.040> that<00:03:16.550> are

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
resolution enzymes are enzymes that are

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.820 
resolution enzymes are enzymes that are
capable<00:03:16.850> of<00:03:17.180> making<00:03:17.450> internal<00:03:18.350> cuts<00:03:18.620> at

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
capable of making internal cuts at

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.850 
capable of making internal cuts at
specific<00:03:19.490> sites<00:03:19.760> in<00:03:20.000> a<00:03:20.090> DNA<00:03:20.300> molecule<00:03:20.680> so<00:03:21.680> we

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
specific sites in a DNA molecule so we

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.280 
specific sites in a DNA molecule so we
need<00:03:22.100> to<00:03:22.220> incorporate<00:03:22.610> our<00:03:23.110> insulin<00:03:24.110> gene

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
need to incorporate our insulin gene

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.880 
need to incorporate our insulin gene
into<00:03:24.710> this<00:03:24.860> vector<00:03:25.750> so<00:03:26.750> what<00:03:26.960> we<00:03:27.080> did<00:03:27.230> was<00:03:27.470> way

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
into this vector so what we did was way

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.160 
into this vector so what we did was way
I<00:03:27.920> made<00:03:28.400> a<00:03:28.430> cut<00:03:28.700> using<00:03:28.910> restriction<00:03:29.810> enzyme

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
I made a cut using restriction enzyme

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.760 
I made a cut using restriction enzyme
and<00:03:30.410> now<00:03:31.100> I<00:03:31.130> have<00:03:31.460> the<00:03:31.610> gene<00:03:32.230> so<00:03:33.230> I<00:03:33.530> have

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
and now I have the gene so I have

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.160 
and now I have the gene so I have
incorporated<00:03:34.550> my<00:03:34.820> insulin<00:03:35.420> gene<00:03:35.600> into<00:03:36.050> the

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
incorporated my insulin gene into the

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.640 
incorporated my insulin gene into the
vector<00:03:36.350> and<00:03:36.730> I<00:03:37.730> seal<00:03:38.210> that<00:03:38.420> gene<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:39.170> cutting

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
vector and I seal that gene the cutting

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.790 
vector and I seal that gene the cutting
ends<00:03:39.980> with<00:03:40.340> enzyme<00:03:40.910> ligase<00:03:41.120> now<00:03:41.990> we<00:03:42.050> have<00:03:42.470> the

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
ends with enzyme ligase now we have the

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.610 
ends with enzyme ligase now we have the

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
as it is simple to manipulate and we

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.930

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
is called as transformation now step

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.020

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:53.830 
synthesizing human insulin inside and so

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.680 
synthesizing human insulin inside and so
we<00:07:53.980> need<00:07:54.190> to<00:07:54.220> culture<00:07:54.640> these<00:07:54.850> in<00:07:55.150> large<00:07:55.330> scale

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:55.690 
we need to culture these in large scale

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.660 
we need to culture these in large scale
for<00:07:56.020> getting<00:07:56.440> large-scale<00:07:57.130> production<00:07:57.640> of
