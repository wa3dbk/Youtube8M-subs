00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.760
 so Kasparov grabbed back 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:20.060
 but there is still a very new almost 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.740
 last minute 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.160
 In this game nothing fiddler came from 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.640
 from uganda this very well known 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.480
 position played came all the way 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.730
 unexpectedly little co2 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.960
 that was not going to happen in a partie 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:45.719
 important is played but practical 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:52.289
 a euro the idea wants to know 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:54.600
 the connection can not be avoided and it 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.140
 There is also a risk because the king is in 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:06.430
 a pan 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:13.110
 on one of the city ​​that hitler one 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:13.110
 concrete preparation fit and played 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:24.479
 And that is already this order 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:27.670
 pretty similar to kramnik lego 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.490
 knows has a specialist area and can 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.780
 that plays a good part with pressure 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:38.759
 on both wings 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:42.850
 you can find the lot 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:47.530
 It shows a very good position 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:52.690
 but here is the critical third train 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:59.399
 is who i am grad 5 and make short 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:59.399
 After the changed was his internships 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:16.239
 in which white film plays itself 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:26.410
 normal train the normal we know 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:31.930
 that we, for example, a king 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:38.700
 the 16 then after such an exchange 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.700
 there will still almost months 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:51.579
 somebody has that runner d7 the 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:58.630
 Partie one can not know if that one 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:03:02.470
 a friendlier crap was or the 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:06.480
 variant I had a pretty good double 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:11.440
 it was a few small ones 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:18.550
 Keller I do not support them 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:20.050
 Not quite I know plays that is 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:26.830
 not the best 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:34.690
 it was good to frequent night'm 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:35.380
 nice if he plays so around the farmers 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.400
 cover up 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:42.360
 then takes place and with strong attack of 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:48.690
 The whole king will wake up and 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.690
 afterwards in this position 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:04:11.890
 and he regains the figure and the 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:12.460
 Partie the game knows what nobody has 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.310
 imagine 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.770
 although this king is a bit weak 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.390
 but that is not so black is 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:25.180
 active and there were some small ones 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:31.290
 little things on the way for example 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:36.120
 here could whiten the six 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:46.480
 the problem is that on dispenser 26 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:49.320
 runners could at 58 could be white 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.780
 and claim more builds 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.940
 maybe you can black the 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:05:01.810
 monthly winner but this always stays 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:04.230
 very strong and almost for example 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:08.230
 six play law to prepare 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:10.000
 then it becomes real and it is 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:14.180
 but not clear like me in front of his stomach 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.780
 or back you want 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.940
 it is best way he says the same about 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.970
 play 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:29.150
 because now is not about the statute 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:31.870
 not so good finds from the 6 king will be in 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.870
 danger 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:39.430
 very fast 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:46.490
 So the king has to go and then 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:51.970
 Black would have such a game 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:54.020
 He will be very clear about this order 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.289
 there is building right now 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:00.500
 but that is not someone else 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:04.370
 The city of white may want children 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:07.130
 and block to the farmers 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:11.410
 There are still chances for a one 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:16.160
 fight in this lot said position 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:21.050
 maybe it was not and does not say so 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:23.470
 best train black could start playing though 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:27.139
 Runner then happens 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:30.979
 then she will go back again 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:35.449
 in the variant of the part and if 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:38.380
 the six black ones themselves too soon 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:41.750
 play there now with the king on co2 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:44.860
 the player becomes very strong there 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:50.360
 not only the game but you can see it too 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:52.820
 Missed and that means sacher 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:59.380
 sixth black an excellent 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:59.380
 position so you can say that 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:06.979
 I'm just fine that's five 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:10.870
 I have no no advantage for far 

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:14.880
 not at all pursued for it white found 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:25.490
 maybe the future will be 

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:25.490
 do not realize my opinion
