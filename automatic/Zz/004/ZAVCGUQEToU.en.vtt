stadium not surprising I don't think

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.459 
stadium not surprising I don't think
we'll<00:00:33.969> see<00:00:34.000> any<00:00:34.090> in<00:00:34.300> the<00:00:34.390> OSL<00:00:34.719> and<00:00:34.960> those<00:00:35.440> are

00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:35.469 
we'll see any in the OSL and those are

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:37.110 
we'll see any in the OSL and those are
quite<00:00:35.860> near<00:00:36.040> the<00:00:36.160> front<00:00:36.430> row<00:00:36.579> as<00:00:36.699> well<00:00:36.850> so

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
quite near the front row as well so

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.400 
quite near the front row as well so
that's<00:00:37.329> that<00:00:37.629> definitely<00:00:38.020> is<00:00:38.110> a<00:00:38.170> little<00:00:38.320> bit

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
that's that definitely is a little bit

surprising<00:00:38.710> I<00:00:38.980> think<00:00:39.370> it's<00:00:39.460> so<00:00:39.610> cool<00:00:39.820> the<00:00:39.940> way

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030

the<00:00:40.059> Koreans<00:00:40.480> can<00:00:40.600> actually<00:00:40.930> fill<00:00:41.199> a<00:00:41.230> stadium

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
the Koreans can actually fill a stadium

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.490 
the Koreans can actually fill a stadium
for<00:00:41.649> an<00:00:41.710> eSports<00:00:42.040> game<00:00:42.220> considering<00:00:42.610> that

for an eSports game considering that

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.420 
for an eSports game considering that
essentially<00:00:44.500> you're<00:00:44.620> just<00:00:44.649> looking<00:00:45.010> at<00:00:45.129> giant

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
essentially you're just looking at giant

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.979 
essentially you're just looking at giant
TV<00:00:45.699> screens<00:00:46.000> and<00:00:46.239> the<00:00:46.480> players<00:00:46.690> are<00:00:46.870> just

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
TV screens and the players are just

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.110 
TV screens and the players are just
sitting<00:00:47.140> in<00:00:47.260> boxes<00:00:47.409> so<00:00:47.820> that's<00:00:48.820> quite<00:00:49.030> an

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
sitting in boxes so that's quite an

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.399 
sitting in boxes so that's quite an
achievement<00:00:49.210> if<00:00:49.629> they<00:00:49.720> can<00:00:49.839> get<00:00:49.900> players<00:00:50.199> into

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:50.409 
achievement if they can get players into

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:52.380 
achievement if they can get players into
stadiums<00:00:50.769> when<00:00:50.980> most<00:00:51.640> of<00:00:51.790> the<00:00:51.879> time<00:00:52.059> it's<00:00:52.329> just

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
stadiums when most of the time it's just

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.600 
stadiums when most of the time it's just
player<00:00:52.750> sitting<00:00:52.989> in<00:00:53.110> boxes<00:00:53.290> and<00:00:53.620> obviously

player sitting in boxes and obviously

the<00:00:54.699> games<00:00:54.879> are<00:00:55.030> seen<00:00:55.149> on<00:00:55.239> screens<00:00:55.540> and<00:00:55.690> you

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
the games are seen on screens and you

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.939 
the games are seen on screens and you
could<00:00:55.870> probably<00:00:56.019> watch<00:00:56.229> it<00:00:56.290> better<00:00:56.649> from<00:00:56.800> the

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
could probably watch it better from the

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:58.170 
could probably watch it better from the
comfort<00:00:57.250> of<00:00:57.309> your<00:00:57.370> own<00:00:57.460> home<00:00:57.579> than<00:00:57.909> watching

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
it on a giant screen so it just shows

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.649

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
two players and I I for one out hoping

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.880 
two players and I I for one out hoping
that<00:01:28.600> store<00:01:28.810> takes<00:01:29.020> Monty<00:01:29.350> halls<00:01:29.500> that<00:01:29.650> we<00:01:29.740> get

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
that store takes Monty halls that we get

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.539 
that store takes Monty halls that we get
a<00:01:29.920> fifth<00:01:30.130> game<00:01:30.310> but<00:01:31.000> I<00:01:31.420> think<00:01:31.780> at<00:01:32.200> this<00:01:32.350> stage

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
a fifth game but I think at this stage

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.980 
a fifth game but I think at this stage
even<00:01:33.549> if<00:01:33.640> PC<00:01:33.820> wins<00:01:34.060> it's<00:01:34.240> obvious<00:01:34.600> he<00:01:34.689> deserved

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
even if PC wins it's obvious he deserved

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.899 
even if PC wins it's obvious he deserved

fast-expanding because I think store

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.069 
fast-expanding because I think store
first<00:01:51.460> of<00:01:51.579> all<00:01:51.670> does<00:01:52.270> generally<00:01:52.749> like<00:01:52.869> to<00:01:52.899> play

first of all does generally like to play
a<00:01:53.109> standard<00:01:53.409> game<00:01:53.530> even<00:01:53.770> though<00:01:53.829> he<00:01:53.920> was

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
a standard game even though he was

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:56.160 
a standard game even though he was
unorthodox<00:01:54.280> in<00:01:54.759> in<00:01:54.939> that<00:01:55.299> game<00:01:55.539> on<00:01:55.749> desperado

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
unorthodox in in that game on desperado

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.679 
unorthodox in in that game on desperado
which<00:01:56.380> he<00:01:56.499> won<00:01:57.060> excuse<00:01:58.060> me<00:01:58.149> but<00:01:58.270> I<00:01:58.299> do<00:01:58.389> think<00:01:58.569> he

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
which he won excuse me but I do think he

00:01:58.689 --> 00:01:59.999 
which he won excuse me but I do think he
likes<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:58.929> play<00:01:59.020> standard<00:01:59.380> game<00:01:59.530> I<00:01:59.679> think<00:01:59.889> be

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
likes to play standard game I think be

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.550 
likes to play standard game I think be
sooo<00:02:00.189> on<00:02:01.179> Monty<00:02:01.600> Hall<00:02:01.780> likes<00:02:02.020> to<00:02:02.139> fastest<00:02:02.439> man

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
sooo on Monty Hall likes to fastest man

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.840 
sooo on Monty Hall likes to fastest man
though<00:02:02.679> he<00:02:02.770> has<00:02:02.889> been<00:02:03.069> cheese<00:02:03.280> so<00:02:03.520> many<00:02:03.700> times

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
though he has been cheese so many times

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.609 
though he has been cheese so many times
on<00:02:03.939> Monty<00:02:04.149> Hall<00:02:04.270> he<00:02:04.389> will<00:02:04.509> be<00:02:04.600> very<00:02:04.869> wary<00:02:05.139> of<00:02:05.289> it

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
on Monty Hall he will be very wary of it

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.520 
on Monty Hall he will be very wary of it
but<00:02:06.189> I<00:02:06.219> think<00:02:06.459> once<00:02:07.179> he<00:02:07.270> Scouts<00:02:07.990> aggressively

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
but I think once he Scouts aggressively

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.809 
but I think once he Scouts aggressively
it<00:02:08.619> is<00:02:08.709> aware<00:02:09.009> of<00:02:09.039> what<00:02:09.190> his<00:02:09.399> opponent<00:02:09.700> might

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
it is aware of what his opponent might

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.610 
it is aware of what his opponent might
try<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.030> do<00:02:10.209> I<00:02:10.240> think<00:02:10.539> he'll<00:02:10.660> be<00:02:10.690> okay<00:02:11.050> and<00:02:11.500> it

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
try to do I think he'll be okay and it

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.540 
try to do I think he'll be okay and it
definitely<00:02:11.830> looked<00:02:12.190> like<00:02:12.220> any<00:02:12.430> of<00:02:12.490> the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
definitely looked like any of the

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.070 
definitely looked like any of the
players<00:02:12.730> that<00:02:12.819> said<00:02:13.060> any<00:02:13.209> early<00:02:13.660> probes<00:02:13.930> out

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
players that said any early probes out

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.940 
players that said any early probes out
just<00:02:14.380> yet<00:02:14.590> so<00:02:15.069> that<00:02:15.550> suggests<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:16.000> me<00:02:16.060> that<00:02:16.150> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
just yet so that suggests to me that the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
just yet so that suggests to me that the
possibility<00:02:17.950> of<00:02:17.980> cheese<00:02:18.220> is<00:02:18.340> unlikely<00:02:18.700> and

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
possibility of cheese is unlikely and

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.340 
possibility of cheese is unlikely and
storage<00:02:19.240> is<00:02:19.330> putting<00:02:19.569> up<00:02:19.630> his<00:02:19.720> probe<00:02:19.990> next<00:02:20.290> to

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
storage is putting up his probe next to

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.930 
storage is putting up his probe next to
his<00:02:20.470> base<00:02:20.650> and<00:02:20.830> peace<00:02:21.340> who<00:02:21.430> looks<00:02:21.610> like<00:02:21.670> he's

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
his base and peace who looks like he's

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.250 
his base and peace who looks like he's
doing<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.240> same<00:02:22.420> putting<00:02:22.810> up<00:02:22.870> his<00:02:22.930> pile<00:02:23.140> on

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
doing the same putting up his pile on

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.240 
doing the same putting up his pile on
next<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.500> his<00:02:23.590> base<00:02:23.709> and<00:02:23.860> pieces<00:02:24.069> put<00:02:24.100> the

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
next to his base and pieces put the

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.590 
next to his base and pieces put the
power<00:02:24.370> all<00:02:24.430> right<00:02:24.520> next<00:02:24.640> Nexus<00:02:25.000> so<00:02:25.420> this

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
power all right next Nexus so this

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.699 
power all right next Nexus so this
suggests<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:25.990> me<00:02:26.020> that<00:02:26.110> both<00:02:26.380> players<00:02:26.530> are

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
suggests to me that both players are

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.040 
suggests to me that both players are
looking<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:27.010> fast<00:02:27.190> expand<00:02:27.610> or<00:02:28.330> or<00:02:28.630> tech<00:02:28.870> and

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
looking to fast expand or or tech and

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.000 
looking to fast expand or or tech and
then<00:02:29.140> expand<00:02:29.410> but<00:02:29.560> neither<00:02:29.709> player

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
then expand but neither player

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.140 
then expand but neither player
definitely<00:02:30.400> looking<00:02:30.580> to<00:02:30.640> eddie's<00:02:30.880> do<00:02:31.000> any

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
definitely looking to eddie's do any

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.330 
definitely looking to eddie's do any
sort<00:02:31.240> of<00:02:31.360> cheese<00:02:31.599> and<00:02:31.810> I<00:02:32.440> think<00:02:32.770> this<00:02:32.950> is<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.130> big

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
sort of cheese and I think this is a big

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.320 
sort of cheese and I think this is a big
game<00:02:33.370> I<00:02:33.550> don't<00:02:33.670> think<00:02:33.790> store<00:02:33.940> would<00:02:34.090> want<00:02:34.270> to

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
game I don't think store would want to

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.790 
game I don't think store would want to
risk<00:02:34.480> a<00:02:34.599> cheese<00:02:34.810> in<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:35.020> game<00:02:35.140> like<00:02:35.170> this<00:02:35.470> where

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
risk a cheese in a game like this where

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.589 
risk a cheese in a game like this where
if<00:02:36.190> he<00:02:36.340> cheeses<00:02:36.730> and<00:02:36.880> fails<00:02:37.120> he<00:02:37.330> would<00:02:37.420> go<00:02:37.480> out

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
if he cheeses and fails he would go out

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.720 
if he cheeses and fails he would go out
it<00:02:37.690> takes<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:37.870> lot<00:02:38.050> of<00:02:38.080> a<00:02:38.350> lot<00:02:39.100> of<00:02:39.220> guts<00:02:39.460> to<00:02:39.640> be

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.130 
very wary of the cheese and scouting and
luckily<00:03:01.819> neither<00:03:02.180> neither<00:03:02.450> player<00:03:02.750> has<00:03:02.930> gone

luckily neither neither player has gone

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.360 
luckily neither neither player has gone
for<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.319> teens<00:03:03.500> because<00:03:03.739> surely<00:03:04.159> if<00:03:04.220> they'd

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
for the teens because surely if they'd

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.559 
for the teens because surely if they'd
gone<00:03:04.489> for<00:03:04.700> it<00:03:04.730> they<00:03:04.849> would<00:03:04.970> have<00:03:05.060> they<00:03:05.420> would

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
gone for it they would have they would

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.179 
gone for it they would have they would
be<00:03:05.659> failing<00:03:05.900> in<00:03:06.109> that<00:03:06.200> right<00:03:06.349> now<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:06.680> both

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:07.189 
be failing in that right now and both

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:09.309 
be failing in that right now and both
players<00:03:07.489> checking<00:03:07.879> so<00:03:08.269> this<00:03:08.750> is<00:03:08.780> very

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
players checking so this is very

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.589 
players checking so this is very
reminiscent<00:03:09.739> of<00:03:10.040> stork<00:03:10.400> vs<00:03:10.730> reach<00:03:10.939> on<00:03:11.180> Monty

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
reminiscent of stork vs reach on Monty

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.920 
reminiscent of stork vs reach on Monty
Hall<00:03:11.750> which<00:03:11.989> stork<00:03:12.290> lost<00:03:13.269> crucially<00:03:14.269> but<00:03:14.780> it

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
Hall which stork lost crucially but it

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.599 
Hall which stork lost crucially but it
is<00:03:15.049> very<00:03:15.079> reminiscent<00:03:15.590> off<00:03:15.859> that<00:03:16.010> matchup<00:03:16.220> and

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
is very reminiscent off that matchup and

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:18.190 
is very reminiscent off that matchup and
of<00:03:16.970> course<00:03:17.030> in<00:03:17.329> that<00:03:17.420> matchup<00:03:17.599> reach<00:03:17.900> to<00:03:18.170> the

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
of course in that matchup reach to the

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.690 
of course in that matchup reach to the
unique<00:03:18.500> strategy<00:03:18.859> where<00:03:18.980> he<00:03:19.040> put<00:03:19.220> two<00:03:19.400> rivers

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
unique strategy where he put two rivers

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.800 
unique strategy where he put two rivers
down<00:03:19.849> in<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.060> middle<00:03:20.299> of<00:03:20.359> a<00:03:20.450> band<00:03:20.599> that<00:03:20.629> was

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
down in the middle of a band that was

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.330 
down in the middle of a band that was
brilliant<00:03:20.989> play<00:03:21.260> by<00:03:21.290> reach<00:03:21.590> and<00:03:21.799> he<00:03:22.099> can't

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
brilliant play by reach and he can't

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.039 
brilliant play by reach and he can't
start<00:03:22.579> completely<00:03:23.030> off<00:03:23.209> guard<00:03:23.419> with<00:03:23.870> those

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
start completely off guard with those

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.420

with the orbs with the observer but

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.080 
with the orbs with the observer but
definitely<00:03:28.250> this<00:03:28.340> is<00:03:28.489> going<00:03:28.609> to<00:03:28.669> give<00:03:28.790> stork<00:03:29.000> a

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
definitely this is going to give stork a

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.569 
definitely this is going to give stork a
good<00:03:29.209> chance<00:03:29.450> here<00:03:29.720> and<00:03:30.129> starting<00:03:31.129> to<00:03:31.189> mind

identical<00:04:26.479> bills<00:04:27.020> this<00:04:27.229> far<00:04:27.380> in<00:04:27.470> the<00:04:27.500> game<00:04:27.650> and

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
identical bills this far in the game and

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.439 
identical bills this far in the game and
it'll<00:04:28.130> be<00:04:28.280> interesting<00:04:28.430> when<00:04:29.060> one<00:04:29.120> of<00:04:29.389> these

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
it'll be interesting when one of these

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:30.939 
it'll be interesting when one of these
players<00:04:29.690> decides<00:04:30.050> to<00:04:30.229> actually<00:04:30.500> try<00:04:30.710> and<00:04:30.740> go

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
players decides to actually try and go

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:32.770 
players decides to actually try and go
for<00:04:31.099> that<00:04:31.190> expansion<00:04:31.550> again<00:04:32.210> the<00:04:32.599> great<00:04:32.750> thing

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
for that expansion again the great thing

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.779 
for that expansion again the great thing
about<00:04:32.930> expanding<00:04:33.620> on<00:04:33.740> Monty<00:04:34.070> Hall<00:04:34.220> well<00:04:34.639> not

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 
about expanding on Monty Hall well not

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:35.770 
about expanding on Monty Hall well not
the<00:04:34.940> grating<00:04:35.210> the<00:04:35.240> unfortunate<00:04:35.720> about

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
the grating the unfortunate about

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.060 
the grating the unfortunate about
spending<00:04:36.080> money<00:04:36.169> on<00:04:36.320> it<00:04:36.500> that's<00:04:36.650> very<00:04:36.830> hard<00:04:37.010> to

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
spending money on it that's very hard to

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.469 
spending money on it that's very hard to
actually<00:04:37.220> attack<00:04:37.610> a<00:04:37.639> player's<00:04:37.909> expansion<00:04:38.330> and

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
actually attack a player's expansion and

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.570 
actually attack a player's expansion and
be<00:04:39.229> so<00:04:39.380> just<00:04:39.560> trying<00:04:39.770> to<00:04:39.919> get<00:04:40.039> down<00:04:40.220> off<00:04:40.430> that

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
be so just trying to get down off that

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.649 
be so just trying to get down off that
side<00:04:40.759> maybe<00:04:40.940> he's<00:04:41.120> trying<00:04:41.240> to<00:04:41.360> go<00:04:41.449> and<00:04:41.539> try<00:04:41.630> to

00:04:41.649 --> 00:04:41.659 
side maybe he's trying to go and try to

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:42.879 
side maybe he's trying to go and try to
the<00:04:41.870> proxy<00:04:42.110> or<00:04:42.169> something<00:04:42.349> but<00:04:42.440> he's<00:04:42.650> failed

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
the proxy or something but he's failed

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:44.379 
the proxy or something but he's failed
two<00:04:43.039> times<00:04:43.250> with<00:04:43.370> that<00:04:43.430> pylon<00:04:43.789> trick<00:04:44.030> to

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
two times with that pylon trick to

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:45.219 
two times with that pylon trick to
actually<00:04:44.630> get<00:04:44.720> through<00:04:44.840> that<00:04:44.930> mineralized

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
actually get through that mineralized

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:46.499 
actually get through that mineralized
managed<00:04:45.620> to<00:04:45.740> get<00:04:45.830> through<00:04:46.009> this<00:04:46.099> time<00:04:46.310> and

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:46.509 
managed to get through this time and

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:48.370 
managed to get through this time and
gets<00:04:47.509> through<00:04:47.659> just<00:04:47.870> before<00:04:48.139> that<00:04:48.229> you're

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
gets through just before that you're

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.420 
gets through just before that you're
gonna<00:04:48.530> rise<00:04:48.650> so<00:04:48.770> that's<00:04:48.949> great<00:04:49.130> he's

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
gonna rise so that's great he's

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.089 
gonna rise so that's great he's
preserved<00:04:49.759> that<00:04:50.349> program<00:04:51.349> stork<00:04:51.800> has<00:04:51.860> done

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099 
preserved that program stork has done

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:53.950 
preserved that program stork has done
the<00:04:52.219> same<00:04:52.400> so<00:04:52.700> both<00:04:52.940> players<00:04:53.270> mirroring<00:04:53.870> each

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
the same so both players mirroring each

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
the same so both players mirroring each
other<00:04:54.200> move<00:04:54.860> from<00:04:55.190> move

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
other move from move

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.110 
other move from move
and<00:04:56.220> I<00:04:56.280> suppose<00:04:56.550> that's<00:04:56.670> a<00:04:56.820> little<00:04:57.030> bit

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
and I suppose that's a little bit

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.790 
and I suppose that's a little bit
appropriate<00:04:57.630> for<00:04:57.750> a<00:04:57.810> final<00:04:58.080> of<00:04:58.260> this<00:04:58.410> caliber

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
appropriate for a final of this caliber

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.500 
appropriate for a final of this caliber
but<00:04:59.280> they're<00:04:59.670> bound<00:04:59.910> to<00:05:00.000> know<00:05:00.150> that<00:05:00.390> the

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
but they're bound to know that the

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.030 
but they're bound to know that the
probes<00:05:00.780> are<00:05:00.990> in<00:05:01.110> those<00:05:01.260> lanes<00:05:01.500> and<00:05:01.770> that<00:05:01.890> there

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
probes are in those lanes and that there

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.530 
probes are in those lanes and that there
might<00:05:02.160> be<00:05:02.220> some<00:05:02.460> sort<00:05:02.580> of<00:05:02.670> proxy<00:05:03.090> build<00:05:03.270> going

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
might be some sort of proxy build going

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.510 
might be some sort of proxy build going
on<00:05:03.660> there<00:05:03.870> and<00:05:04.020> that<00:05:04.920> was<00:05:05.010> I<00:05:05.100> think<00:05:05.160> storks

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
on there and that was I think storks

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.220 
on there and that was I think storks

to<00:05:14.160> see<00:05:14.280> if<00:05:14.340> either<00:05:14.550> players<00:05:14.910> trying<00:05:15.120> a<00:05:15.240> sort

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.420 
to see if either players trying a sort

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.410 
to see if either players trying a sort
of<00:05:15.450> a<00:05:15.510> proxy<00:05:15.840> thing<00:05:15.960> and<00:05:16.140> peace<00:05:17.210> peace<00:05:18.210> was

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.420 
of a proxy thing and peace peace was

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.760 
of a proxy thing and peace peace was
actually<00:05:18.690> managed<00:05:18.960> to<00:05:18.990> get<00:05:19.140> a<00:05:19.200> true<00:05:19.440> goon<00:05:19.590> out

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
actually managed to get a true goon out

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.140 
actually managed to get a true goon out
of<00:05:20.010> those<00:05:20.220> mineralize<00:05:20.670> he's<00:05:20.820> managed<00:05:21.000> to<00:05:21.030> use

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
of those mineralize he's managed to use

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.220 
of those mineralize he's managed to use
a<00:05:21.180> probe<00:05:21.420> to<00:05:21.450> push<00:05:21.690> that<00:05:21.780> you're<00:05:21.930> good<00:05:22.020> not<00:05:22.110> to

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
a probe to push that you're good not to

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.930 
a probe to push that you're good not to
kill<00:05:22.500> off<00:05:22.620> that<00:05:22.800> probe<00:05:23.040> stork<00:05:23.580> hasn't<00:05:23.850> been

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
kill off that probe stork hasn't been

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.540 
kill off that probe stork hasn't been
the<00:05:24.060> same<00:05:24.090> so<00:05:24.750> that's<00:05:25.320> a<00:05:25.440> little<00:05:25.710> bit<00:05:25.830> that's

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
the same so that's a little bit that's

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.860 
the same so that's a little bit that's
definitely<00:05:26.730> more<00:05:27.000> clever<00:05:27.240> by<00:05:27.390> me<00:05:27.540> sue<00:05:27.690> and

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
definitely more clever by me sue and

him<00:05:40.770> is<00:05:40.920> that<00:05:41.040> he's<00:05:41.250> managed<00:05:41.580> to<00:05:41.610> kill<00:05:41.850> that

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
him is that he's managed to kill that

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.690 
him is that he's managed to kill that
probe<00:05:42.300> just<00:05:43.050> to<00:05:43.320> the<00:05:43.410> right<00:05:43.440> of<00:05:43.620> his<00:05:43.830> base<00:05:44.010> to

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
probe just to the right of his base to

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.130 
probe just to the right of his base to
the<00:05:44.790> rest<00:05:45.090> of<00:05:45.210> his<00:05:45.330> bit<00:05:45.540> to<00:05:45.660> the<00:05:45.810> east<00:05:45.930> of<00:05:46.020> his

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
the rest of his bit to the east of his

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
the rest of his bit to the east of his
base<00:05:46.260> and<00:05:46.440> that's<00:05:46.530> going<00:05:46.800> to<00:05:46.860> give<00:05:46.980> him<00:05:47.100> a

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
base and that's going to give him a

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.240 
base and that's going to give him a
little<00:05:47.340> bit<00:05:47.400> of<00:05:47.520> a<00:05:47.580> chance<00:05:47.790> to<00:05:48.890> get<00:05:49.890> a<00:05:49.950> scouting

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
little bit of a chance to get a scouting

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.340 
little bit of a chance to get a scouting
advantage<00:05:50.700> over<00:05:50.880> stork<00:05:51.270> because<00:05:51.960> his<00:05:52.080> probe

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
advantage over stork because his probe

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.570 
advantage over stork because his probe
is<00:05:52.470> still<00:05:52.620> alive<00:05:52.830> sitting<00:05:53.280> outside<00:05:53.400> the

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
is still alive sitting outside the

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.090 
is still alive sitting outside the
mineral<00:05:53.850> line<00:05:53.940> of<00:05:54.060> pieces<00:05:54.330> and<00:05:54.480> thus<00:05:55.100> sitting

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
mineral line of pieces and thus sitting

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.740 
mineral line of pieces and thus sitting
outside<00:05:56.220> storks<00:05:56.610> mineral<00:05:57.180> line<00:05:57.300> and<00:05:57.480> pieces

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
outside storks mineral line and pieces

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.150 
outside storks mineral line and pieces
just<00:05:57.840> brought<00:05:58.050> back<00:05:58.170> to<00:05:58.320> go<00:05:58.440> down<00:05:58.620> so<00:05:58.980> he's

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
just brought back to go down so he's

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.110 
just brought back to go down so he's
gonna<00:05:59.280> know<00:05:59.430> his<00:05:59.520> truck<00:05:59.670> tries<00:05:59.850> to<00:05:59.880> expanded

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
gonna know his truck tries to expanded

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.670 
gonna know his truck tries to expanded
that<00:06:00.300> top<00:06:00.510> and<00:06:00.690> historic<00:06:00.990> now<00:06:01.080> just<00:06:01.290> mining

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
that top and historic now just mining

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.080 
that top and historic now just mining
both<00:06:01.950> lanes<00:06:02.220> so<00:06:02.340> I'm<00:06:02.430> not<00:06:02.490> sure<00:06:02.550> what<00:06:02.700> what

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
both lanes so I'm not sure what what

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.940 
both lanes so I'm not sure what what
stroke<00:06:03.300> is<00:06:03.420> doing<00:06:03.600> here<00:06:03.750> we<00:06:04.170> saw<00:06:04.200> this

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950 
stroke is doing here we saw this

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.190 
stroke is doing here we saw this
yesterday<00:06:05.280> where<00:06:05.880> flash<00:06:06.210> exposed<00:06:06.840> his<00:06:07.020> base

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.200 
yesterday where flash exposed his base

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.750 
yesterday where flash exposed his base
by<00:06:07.380> unnecessarily<00:06:08.010> revealing<00:06:08.520> one<00:06:08.610> of<00:06:08.700> the

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:08.760 
by unnecessarily revealing one of the

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.240 
by unnecessarily revealing one of the
lanes<00:06:08.940> and<00:06:09.180> that<00:06:10.050> was<00:06:10.170> a<00:06:10.380> huge<00:06:10.680> mistake<00:06:10.890> and<00:06:11.070> he

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
lanes and that was a huge mistake and he

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.830 
lanes and that was a huge mistake and he
paid<00:06:11.460> the<00:06:11.550> price<00:06:11.670> for<00:06:11.730> that<00:06:11.940> but<00:06:12.120> stork<00:06:12.420> mining

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
paid the price for that but stork mining

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.780 
paid the price for that but stork mining
minerals<00:06:13.020> at<00:06:13.290> both<00:06:13.560> of<00:06:13.590> those<00:06:13.890> names<00:06:14.160> trying

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
minerals at both of those names trying

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:16.340 
minerals at both of those names trying
trying<00:06:15.060> to<00:06:15.240> open<00:06:15.420> up<00:06:15.540> i'm<00:06:15.660> not<00:06:15.900> sure<00:06:16.050> what<00:06:16.200> the

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:16.350 
trying to open up i'm not sure what the

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:17.480 
trying to open up i'm not sure what the
person<00:06:16.620> that<00:06:16.710> is<00:06:16.800> maybe<00:06:16.920> it's<00:06:17.070> obviously<00:06:17.310> give

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
person that is maybe it's obviously give

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:18.800 
person that is maybe it's obviously give
himself<00:06:17.610> more<00:06:17.760> options<00:06:18.240> and<00:06:18.300> attack<00:06:18.570> but<00:06:18.750> it

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
himself more options and attack but it

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.420 
himself more options and attack but it
also<00:06:18.930> makes<00:06:19.560> him<00:06:19.740> more<00:06:19.860> vulnerable<00:06:19.920> and

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
also makes him more vulnerable and

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.520 
also makes him more vulnerable and
defense<00:06:20.730> should<00:06:21.390> be<00:06:21.960> sooo<00:06:22.140> gain<00:06:22.290> the<00:06:22.410> upper

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
defense should be sooo gain the upper

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:23.840 
defense should be sooo gain the upper
hand<00:06:22.650> in<00:06:22.950> the<00:06:23.070> game<00:06:23.220> at<00:06:23.340> some<00:06:23.490> point<00:06:23.670> will<00:06:23.760> make

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:23.850 
hand in the game at some point will make

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.520 
hand in the game at some point will make
it<00:06:23.940> difficult<00:06:24.090> more<00:06:24.690> difficult<00:06:24.720> for<00:06:25.170> short<00:06:25.440> to

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
it difficult more difficult for short to

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:26.900 
it difficult more difficult for short to
come<00:06:25.650> back<00:06:25.770> if<00:06:25.980> he<00:06:26.010> opens<00:06:26.250> up<00:06:26.490> both<00:06:26.700> of<00:06:26.730> those

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
come back if he opens up both of those

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.250 
come back if he opens up both of those
lanes<00:06:27.090> opening<00:06:27.450> up<00:06:27.540> both<00:06:27.720> inside<00:06:27.960> lanes<00:06:28.140> and

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
lanes opening up both inside lanes and

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.360 
lanes opening up both inside lanes and
crucially<00:06:28.590> doesn't<00:06:28.800> seem<00:06:28.890> to<00:06:28.980> be<00:06:29.040> opening<00:06:29.310> up

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
crucially doesn't seem to be opening up

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.340 
crucially doesn't seem to be opening up
the<00:06:29.520> middle<00:06:29.700> lane<00:06:29.940> or<00:06:30.120> he<00:06:30.750> is<00:06:30.870> opening<00:06:31.080> up<00:06:31.200> the

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.350 
the middle lane or he is opening up the

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.930 
the middle lane or he is opening up the
middle<00:06:31.500> name<00:06:31.650> as<00:06:31.770> well<00:06:31.920> so<00:06:32.190> he's<00:06:32.670> obviously

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
middle name as well so he's obviously

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.000 
middle name as well so he's obviously
willing<00:06:33.210> to<00:06:33.330> sacrifice<00:06:33.480> the<00:06:34.320> resource<00:06:34.680> loss

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.010 
willing to sacrifice the resource loss

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.040 
willing to sacrifice the resource loss
of<00:06:35.670> using<00:06:36.030> three<00:06:36.240> probes<00:06:36.450> to<00:06:36.600> be<00:06:36.690> to<00:06:36.990> be

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
of using three probes to be to be

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.510 
of using three probes to be to be
opening<00:06:37.350> up<00:06:37.410> those<00:06:37.590> lanes<00:06:37.800> obviously<00:06:38.460> it

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
opening up those lanes obviously it

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.680 
opening up those lanes obviously it
means<00:06:38.640> he's<00:06:38.820> gonna<00:06:38.910> be<00:06:39.060> able<00:06:39.120> to<00:06:39.240> pressure<00:06:39.420> be

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:39.690 
means he's gonna be able to pressure be

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.630 
means he's gonna be able to pressure be
sooo<00:06:39.840> on<00:06:40.050> either<00:06:40.260> front<00:06:40.650> but<00:06:41.070> be<00:06:41.220> so<00:06:41.370> hasn't

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:41.640 
sooo on either front but be so hasn't

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.860 
sooo on either front but be so hasn't
open<00:06:41.820> up<00:06:41.880> any<00:06:42.030> of<00:06:42.090> his<00:06:42.180> own<00:06:42.300> lane<00:06:42.450> so<00:06:42.570> be<00:06:42.720> sooo

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:42.870 
open up any of his own lane so be sooo

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.210 
open up any of his own lane so be sooo
can<00:06:43.020> really<00:06:43.200> decide<00:06:43.470> which<00:06:43.770> direction<00:06:43.920> the

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 
can really decide which direction the

can really decide which direction the

he had sent in and store has much sneak
that<00:06:54.870> probe<00:06:55.080> through<00:06:55.260> and<00:06:55.650> he's<00:06:55.740> just<00:06:55.800> trying

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.010 
that probe through and he's just trying

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.170 
that probe through and he's just trying
to<00:06:56.070> see<00:06:56.190> a<00:06:56.220> peace<00:06:56.400> conference<00:06:56.580> passion

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 
to see a peace conference passion

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.880 
to see a peace conference passion
anywhere<00:06:57.390> he<00:06:57.540> realized<00:06:57.810> that<00:06:57.870> be<00:06:58.470> so<00:06:58.620> hasn't

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:58.890 
anywhere he realized that be so hasn't

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.140 
anywhere he realized that be so hasn't
opened<00:06:59.010> up<00:06:59.250> any<00:06:59.370> of<00:06:59.460> the<00:06:59.520> mineral<00:06:59.790> lines<00:06:59.940> yet

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.150 
opened up any of the mineral lines yet

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.130 
opened up any of the mineral lines yet
but<00:07:00.240> Miss<00:07:00.360> wouldn't<00:07:00.600> said<00:07:00.720> I<00:07:00.750> probe<00:07:01.020> through

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:01.140 
but Miss wouldn't said I probe through

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.480 
but Miss wouldn't said I probe through
down<00:07:01.350> at<00:07:01.440> the<00:07:01.530> middle<00:07:01.740> and<00:07:01.860> I<00:07:02.280> think<00:07:02.430> the

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.490 
down at the middle and I think the

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:03.860 
down at the middle and I think the
purpose<00:07:02.700> they<00:07:02.850> might<00:07:03.000> meet<00:07:03.330> the<00:07:03.420> Scout<00:07:03.600> again

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:03.870 
purpose they might meet the Scout again

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.150 
purpose they might meet the Scout again
obviously<00:07:04.020> store<00:07:04.350> unable<00:07:04.620> to<00:07:04.650> get<00:07:04.860> these<00:07:05.040> two

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 
obviously store unable to get these two

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.730 
obviously store unable to get these two
strategy<00:07:05.640> and<00:07:06.300> stork<00:07:06.930> has<00:07:06.990> got<00:07:07.260> that<00:07:07.380> shuttle

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:07.740 
strategy and stork has got that shuttle

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:08.690 
strategy and stork has got that shuttle
out<00:07:07.860> he's<00:07:08.040> got<00:07:08.220> his<00:07:08.310> robotics<00:07:08.610> facility

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:08.700 
out he's got his robotics facility

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:09.740 
out he's got his robotics facility
building<00:07:09.210> and<00:07:09.330> straw

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:09.750 
building and straw

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.780 
building and straw
is<00:07:09.930> has<00:07:10.230> open<00:07:10.500> up<00:07:10.590> the<00:07:10.680> bottom<00:07:10.920> path<00:07:11.070> so<00:07:11.340> but<00:07:11.760> I

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:11.790 
is has open up the bottom path so but I

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.160 
is has open up the bottom path so but I
that's<00:07:12.060> not<00:07:12.180> gonna<00:07:12.330> bother<00:07:12.450> be<00:07:12.720> soo<00:07:12.840> too<00:07:13.020> much

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:13.170 
that's not gonna bother be soo too much

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:14.540 
that's not gonna bother be soo too much
because<00:07:13.320> he<00:07:13.440> can<00:07:13.620> easily<00:07:13.830> defend<00:07:14.130> that<00:07:14.220> inside

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:14.550 
because he can easily defend that inside

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:15.710 
because he can easily defend that inside
his<00:07:14.670> own<00:07:14.730> Mason<00:07:14.880> be<00:07:15.090> so<00:07:15.150> actually<00:07:15.480> gone<00:07:15.570> for

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720 
his own Mason be so actually gone for

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.480 
his own Mason be so actually gone for
the<00:07:15.780> for<00:07:16.020> the<00:07:16.050> expansion<00:07:16.320> so<00:07:16.860> be<00:07:17.040> so<00:07:17.100> going<00:07:17.370> for

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:17.490 
the for the expansion so be so going for

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:18.560 
the for the expansion so be so going for
the<00:07:17.550> expansion<00:07:17.760> for<00:07:18.060> this<00:07:18.240> is<00:07:18.330> going<00:07:18.450> to<00:07:18.510> be

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:18.570 
the expansion for this is going to be

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:19.520 
the expansion for this is going to be
the<00:07:18.630> first<00:07:18.780> divergence<00:07:19.170> we're<00:07:19.260> going<00:07:19.380> to<00:07:19.440> see

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:19.530 
the first divergence we're going to see

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.740 
the first divergence we're going to see
or<00:07:19.620> basically<00:07:19.890> for<00:07:20.100> that<00:07:20.220> expansion<00:07:20.910> now<00:07:21.180> just

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:21.750 
or basically for that expansion now just

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.520 
or basically for that expansion now just
at<00:07:22.530> the<00:07:22.770> 1130<00:07:23.220> position<00:07:23.670> and<00:07:23.850> so<00:07:24.240> obviously

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:24.530 
at the 1130 position and so obviously

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.870 
at the 1130 position and so obviously
he's<00:07:25.530> not<00:07:25.560> going<00:07:25.920> to<00:07:25.980> get<00:07:26.100> his<00:07:26.280> Reavers<00:07:26.610> up<00:07:26.730> as

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:26.880 
he's not going to get his Reavers up as

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:27.950 
he's not going to get his Reavers up as
quickly<00:07:27.120> he's<00:07:27.300> not<00:07:27.390> gonna<00:07:27.510> have<00:07:27.630> as<00:07:27.780> many

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:27.960 
quickly he's not gonna have as many

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.140 
quickly he's not gonna have as many
rivers<00:07:28.470> and<00:07:28.710> shuttle<00:07:29.070> as<00:07:29.190> stroke<00:07:29.490> is<00:07:29.670> strong

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:30.150 
rivers and shuttle as stroke is strong

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.150 
rivers and shuttle as stroke is strong
or<00:07:30.480> he's<00:07:30.720> not<00:07:30.870> gonna<00:07:30.960> have<00:07:31.080> as<00:07:31.200> many<00:07:31.290> goons<00:07:31.620> so

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160 
or he's not gonna have as many goons so

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.340 
or he's not gonna have as many goons so
the<00:07:32.550> crucial<00:07:33.090> thing<00:07:33.120> go<00:07:33.360> is<00:07:33.540> if<00:07:33.810> if<00:07:33.990> stork<00:07:34.290> is

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:34.350 
the crucial thing go is if if stork is

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:35.510 
the crucial thing go is if if stork is
actually<00:07:34.590> gonna<00:07:34.680> be<00:07:34.770> able<00:07:35.070> to<00:07:35.250> effect<00:07:35.430> an

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 
actually gonna be able to effect an

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.730 
actually gonna be able to effect an
attack
