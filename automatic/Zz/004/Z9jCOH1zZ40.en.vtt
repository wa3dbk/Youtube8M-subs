00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
during the show as long as somebody is

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.929 
during the show as long as somebody is
playing<00:01:25.020> well<00:01:25.320> at<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.680> position<00:01:25.939> you're

every single position group is set but

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.240 
every single position group is set but
one<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.290> it's<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.530> most<00:02:01.740> important<00:02:02.219> one

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
one and it's the most important one

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.160 
one and it's the most important one
cornerback<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.240> mean<00:02:03.689> going<00:02:03.840> into<00:02:03.960> this

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
cornerback and I mean going into this

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.109 
cornerback and I mean going into this
year<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.770> likelihood<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.369> Bob<00:02:05.790> unless

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
year the likelihood is Bob unless

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.819 
year the likelihood is Bob unless
tarvaris<00:02:06.570> jackson<00:02:06.600> wins<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.320> job<00:02:07.530> which<00:02:07.740> i

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
tarvaris jackson wins the job which i

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:08.520 
tarvaris jackson wins the job which i
don't<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:08.039> anyone

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
don't like anyone

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.109 
don't like anyone
is<00:02:08.709> a<00:02:08.740> good<00:02:08.950> scenario<00:02:09.190> just<00:02:09.759> because<00:02:10.000> of<00:02:10.090> the

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
is a good scenario just because of the

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.180 
is a good scenario just because of the
scenario<00:02:10.509> he's<00:02:10.750> in<00:02:10.929> that<00:02:11.650> be<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:11.920> third

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
scenario he's in that be the third

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.710 
scenario he's in that be the third
different<00:02:12.670> starting<00:02:12.940> quarterback<00:02:13.360> in<00:02:13.510> three

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
different starting quarterback in three

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.809 
different starting quarterback in three
years<00:02:13.900> yeah<00:02:14.440> mana<00:02:14.920> it's<00:02:15.310> tough<00:02:15.490> to<00:02:15.670> win

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
years yeah mana it's tough to win

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.130 
years yeah mana it's tough to win
ultimately<00:02:16.270> when<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.510> do<00:02:16.630> it<00:02:16.750> at<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:16.930> which

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
ultimately when you do it at that which

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.840 
ultimately when you do it at that which
they<00:02:17.319> do<00:02:17.380> need<00:02:17.770> some<00:02:18.010> stability<00:02:18.190> there<00:02:18.670> this

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
they do need some stability there this

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.340 
they do need some stability there this
year<00:02:18.970> yeah<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.450> only<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.840> we<00:02:19.990> talked<00:02:20.230> about

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
year yeah the only and we talked about

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.380 
year yeah the only and we talked about
tavaris<00:02:20.860> before<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.340> advantage<00:02:21.700> he<00:02:21.850> has<00:02:22.060> is

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
tavaris before the advantage he has is

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.790 
tavaris before the advantage he has is
having<00:02:22.750> been<00:02:22.930> here<00:02:23.230> knowing<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.680> terminology

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
having been here knowing the terminology

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.860 
having been here knowing the terminology
knowing<00:02:24.700> his<00:02:24.819> receivers<00:02:25.270> but<00:02:25.420> I<00:02:25.510> think<00:02:25.720> we've

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
knowing his receivers but I think we've

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.140 
knowing his receivers but I think we've
seen<00:02:26.290> who<00:02:26.620> he<00:02:26.860> is<00:02:27.100> and<00:02:27.400> it's<00:02:27.580> not<00:02:27.700> just<00:02:27.880> last

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
seen who he is and it's not just last

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.640 
seen who he is and it's not just last
year<00:02:28.239> he's<00:02:28.450> been<00:02:28.660> that<00:02:28.900> guy<00:02:29.140> when<00:02:29.350> he<00:02:29.410> was<00:02:29.530> in

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
year he's been that guy when he was in

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.740 
year he's been that guy when he was in
Minnesota<00:02:30.040> so<00:02:30.370> if<00:02:30.970> he<00:02:31.120> were<00:02:31.270> to<00:02:31.300> win<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.600> job

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
Minnesota so if he were to win the job

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.300 
Minnesota so if he were to win the job
then<00:02:32.050> again<00:02:32.319> you're<00:02:32.530> like<00:02:32.739> all<00:02:32.950> right<00:02:32.980> this<00:02:33.100> is

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
then again you're like all right this is

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.890 
then again you're like all right this is
a<00:02:33.489> big<00:02:33.880> swing<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.239> a<00:02:34.330> Miss<00:02:34.480> on<00:02:34.600> those<00:02:34.780> other
