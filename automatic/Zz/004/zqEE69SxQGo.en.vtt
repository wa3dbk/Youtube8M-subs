guess<00:00:11.509> got<00:00:12.509> it<00:00:12.599> all<00:00:12.719> white<00:00:12.990> on<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.590> white<00:00:13.710> helmet

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:14.420 
guess got it all white on a white helmet

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.330 
guess got it all white on a white helmet
like<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.570> all-white<00:00:15.960> look<00:00:16.260> I<00:00:16.619> think<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.160> looks

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
like the all-white look I think it looks

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.269 
like the all-white look I think it looks
nice<00:00:17.520> but<00:00:18.350> 580<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.500> pretty<00:00:19.890> much<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.130> same

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
nice but 580 is pretty much the same

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.790 
nice but 580 is pretty much the same
thing<00:00:20.490> as<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.670> 480<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.289> only<00:00:22.410> slight

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
thing as the 480 the the only slight

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.060 
thing as the 480 the the only slight
differences<00:00:23.400> are<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:24.029> straps<00:00:24.570> themselves

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
differences are the straps themselves

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.429 
differences are the straps themselves
are<00:00:26.070> this<00:00:26.550> kind<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.880> leather<00:00:27.330> material<00:00:28.140> that

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
are this kind of leather material that

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.650 
are this kind of leather material that
uh<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:29.279> won't<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:30.000> know<00:00:30.060> it's<00:00:30.330> obviously

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
uh that won't you know it's obviously

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.209 
uh that won't you know it's obviously
it's<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.960> little<00:00:31.080> more<00:00:31.349> durable<00:00:31.710> than<00:00:32.070> what

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
it's a little more durable than what

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.120 
it's a little more durable than what
they<00:00:32.309> had<00:00:32.430> on<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.610> 480<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:34.350> chin<00:00:34.620> cup<00:00:34.860> is

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
they had on the 480 and the chin cup is

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.670 
they had on the 480 and the chin cup is
has<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.000> different<00:00:36.480> material<00:00:36.750> on<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.320> inside

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
has a different material on the inside

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.979 
has a different material on the inside
that's<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.610> little<00:00:38.790> better<00:00:38.969> for<00:00:39.270> for<00:00:39.780> when<00:00:39.870> you

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
that's a little better for for when you

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.369 
that's a little better for for when you
sweat<00:00:40.489> doesn't<00:00:41.489> know<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:42.300> know<00:00:42.420> grass<00:00:43.110> and

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
sweat doesn't know you know grass and

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.410 
sweat doesn't know you know grass and
moldy<00:00:44.010> or<00:00:44.040> whatever<00:00:44.370> does<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.030> pretty<00:00:45.210> good<00:00:45.300> job

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
moldy or whatever does a pretty good job

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.040 
moldy or whatever does a pretty good job
of<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:47.180> that's<00:00:48.180> really<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.719> mean<00:00:48.870> it's

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
of that and that's really it I mean it's

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.569 
of that and that's really it I mean it's
got<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.410> very<00:00:50.039> similar<00:00:50.700> look<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:52.579> obviously

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
got a very similar look and obviously

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.700

580 is that if you do have to put Jay

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.929 
580 is that if you do have to put Jay
clips<00:01:06.479> on<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:07.439> cage<00:01:08.040> won't<00:01:08.430> actually<00:01:08.700> fit

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
clips on the cage won't actually fit

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.030 
clips on the cage won't actually fit
it's<00:01:09.479> actually<00:01:09.810> too<00:01:09.960> wide<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.650> size<00:01:10.860> of

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
it's actually too wide for the size of

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.890 
it's actually too wide for the size of
this<00:01:11.159> helmet<00:01:11.400> at<00:01:12.000> least<00:01:12.150> for<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.330> medium<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.810> is

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
this helmet at least for a medium it is

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.630 
this helmet at least for a medium it is
so<00:01:13.200> like<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.560> can<00:01:13.680> see<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.920> just<00:01:14.100> comes<00:01:14.520> off

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
so like you can see it just comes off

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.590 
so like you can see it just comes off
the<00:01:14.790> side<00:01:14.970> laid<00:01:15.180> back<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:16.290> um<00:01:16.970> yeah<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.299> figured

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
the side laid back so um yeah I figured

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.270 
the side laid back so um yeah I figured
there's<00:01:18.750> no<00:01:18.810> point<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.200> me<00:01:19.290> having<00:01:19.619> Jay<00:01:20.009> clips

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
there's no point of me having Jay clips

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.210 
there's no point of me having Jay clips
here<00:01:20.479> for<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.570> gear<00:01:21.750> guards<00:01:22.080> either<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.740> yeah

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
here for the gear guards either so yeah

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.830 
here for the gear guards either so yeah

fine<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.790> mean<00:02:03.180> just<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.630> picture<00:02:04.020> whatever<00:02:04.170> a

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
fine I mean just a picture whatever a

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.859 
fine I mean just a picture whatever a
480<00:02:04.829> would<00:02:05.070> look<00:02:05.250> like<00:02:05.399> on<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:06.420> helmet<00:02:06.719> and

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
480 would look like on that helmet and

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.359 
480 would look like on that helmet and
this<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.229> pretty<00:02:07.409> much<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.710> same<00:02:07.890> thing<00:02:08.129> just

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
this is pretty much the same thing just

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.780 
this is pretty much the same thing just
a<00:02:08.580> couple<00:02:09.149> slight<00:02:09.450> upgrades<00:02:10.430> as<00:02:11.430> far<00:02:11.610> as<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
a couple slight upgrades as far as the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.890 
a couple slight upgrades as far as the
4500

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
4500

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.890 
4500
so<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.819> really<00:02:14.819> like<00:02:14.970> this<00:02:15.150> helmet<00:02:15.390> I<00:02:15.690> mean

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
obviously because it looks good in my

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.729 
obviously because it looks good in my
opinion<00:02:18.480> it's<00:02:18.659> the<00:02:18.690> best<00:02:18.930> looking<00:02:19.140> helmet<00:02:19.650> out

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.490 
opinion it's the best looking helmet out
there<00:02:20.010> which<00:02:20.849> might<00:02:21.540> seem<00:02:21.720> stupid<00:02:22.049> to<00:02:22.290> worry

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
there which might seem stupid to worry

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.110 
there which might seem stupid to worry
about<00:02:22.799> but<00:02:23.069> it's<00:02:23.310> an<00:02:23.489> important<00:02:23.819> thing<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.060> do

the<00:04:36.090> straps<00:04:36.900> here<00:04:37.140> because<00:04:37.440> under<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:38.100> tape

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
is a little CCM logo so I just thought

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.650 
is a little CCM logo so I just thought
that<00:04:41.220> would<00:04:41.430> look<00:04:41.640> better<00:04:41.820> to<00:04:42.060> block<00:04:42.390> that<00:04:42.600> out

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660

that would look better to block that out
as<00:04:42.990> well<00:04:43.140> as<00:04:43.290> the<00:04:43.380> chin<00:04:43.620> Cup<00:04:43.830> which<00:04:44.100> I'm<00:04:44.460> sure<00:04:44.610> a
