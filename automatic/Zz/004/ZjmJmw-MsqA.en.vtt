of<00:00:10.830> 23<00:00:11.429> if<00:00:11.490> you<00:00:11.550> kept<00:00:11.759> going<00:00:11.910> up<00:00:12.269> at<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.509> river

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
of 23 if you kept going up at the river

of 23 if you kept going up at the river
you<00:00:12.900> would<00:00:13.019> wind<00:00:13.230> up<00:00:13.349> in<00:00:13.469> making<00:00:14.150> this<00:00:15.150> truster

you would wind up in making this truster
looks<00:00:15.750> just<00:00:16.080> like<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.680> one<00:00:16.710> that<00:00:17.210> crosses<00:00:18.210> the

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
looks just like the one that crosses the

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.230 
looks just like the one that crosses the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
to tell me that is this the same maybe

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.819 
to tell me that is this the same maybe
the<00:00:33.390> same<00:00:33.630> railroad<00:00:33.930> I'm<00:00:34.230> not<00:00:34.380> sure<00:00:34.590> I'm<00:00:34.739> gonna

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
the same railroad I'm not sure I'm gonna

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.280 
the same railroad I'm not sure I'm gonna
want<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.040> get<00:00:35.160> home<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.340> look<00:00:35.550> at<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> map<00:00:35.969> and

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
want to get home and look at a map and

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.650 
want to get home and look at a map and
try<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.350> figure<00:00:37.590> out<00:00:38.180> if<00:00:39.180> it's<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.420> same

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
try to figure out if it's the same

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.600 
try to figure out if it's the same
railroad<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.350> sure<00:00:40.469> looks<00:00:40.710> like<00:00:40.890> possibly<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
railroad it sure looks like possibly the

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.940 
railroad it sure looks like possibly the
same<00:00:41.820> thing<00:00:42.170> but<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.320> sure<00:00:43.559> looks<00:00:43.770> like<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
same thing but it sure looks like the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.590 
same thing but it sure looks like the
same<00:00:44.840> structure<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.170> brick<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:47.180> turret<00:00:48.180> and

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
same structure the brick the turret and

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.420 
same structure the brick the turret and
everything<00:00:49.020> looks<00:00:49.200> exactly<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.770> same<00:00:49.829> as<00:00:50.070> the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
everything looks exactly the same as the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.750 
everything looks exactly the same as the
one<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.850> across<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:52.020> Oconee<00:00:52.440> River<00:00:52.640> near<00:00:53.640> up

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
one that across the Oconee River near up

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.920 
one that across the Oconee River near up
Coney<00:00:54.000> Georgia

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.750 

I'd<00:01:01.930> like<00:01:02.200> to<00:01:02.290> spin<00:01:02.560> days<00:01:03.220> up<00:01:03.460> there<00:01:03.490> in<00:01:03.700> that

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
I'd like to spin days up there in that

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.570 
I'd like to spin days up there in that
hot<00:01:04.000> metal<00:01:04.420> box<00:01:07.770> these<00:01:08.770> pylons<00:01:09.280> that<00:01:09.430> you're

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
hot metal box these pylons that you're

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.920 
hot metal box these pylons that you're
looking<00:01:09.820> at<00:01:09.940> right<00:01:10.090> here<00:01:10.150> I<00:01:10.360> think<00:01:10.780> we'll

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
looking at right here I think we'll

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.960 
looking at right here I think we'll
probably<00:01:11.050> put<00:01:11.560> here<00:01:11.800> to<00:01:12.040> keep<00:01:13.030> large<00:01:14.970> boats

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
probably put here to keep large boats

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.140 
probably put here to keep large boats
and<00:01:16.240> barges<00:01:16.420> from<00:01:17.170> hitting<00:01:18.300> this<00:01:19.300> turret<00:01:21.150> this

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
and barges from hitting this turret this

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.580 
and barges from hitting this turret this
is<00:01:22.270> very<00:01:22.510> interesting<00:01:22.900> all<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.140> intricate

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
is very interesting all the intricate

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.190 
is very interesting all the intricate
gears<00:01:23.979> I<00:01:24.310> don't<00:01:25.240> know<00:01:25.390> if<00:01:25.510> you<00:01:25.630> can<00:01:25.780> see<00:01:26.020> those

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
gears I don't know if you can see those

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:48.140 
gears I don't know if you can see those
are<00:01:26.350> not<00:01:26.500> really<00:01:27.330> something

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:55.030 

and<00:01:48.630> that's<00:01:48.810> highway<00:01:48.990> 23

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.400 

and<00:01:55.730> we<00:01:55.820> get<00:01:55.940> on<00:01:56.030> down<00:01:56.210> down<00:01:56.930> the<00:01:57.110> river<00:01:57.260> across

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
and we get on down down the river across

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.840 
and we get on down down the river across
the<00:01:57.710> Altamaha<00:01:58.130> River<00:01:58.190> there's<00:01:58.610> another

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
the Altamaha River there's another

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.030 
the Altamaha River there's another
trestle<00:01:59.240> that's<00:01:59.420> no<00:01:59.540> longer<00:01:59.780> used<00:02:00.710> by<00:02:00.980> the

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
trestle that's no longer used by the

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.820 
trestle that's no longer used by the
railroad<00:02:01.810> but<00:02:02.810> this<00:02:02.990> one's<00:02:03.170> obviously<00:02:03.320> still

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
railroad but this one's obviously still

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.000 
railroad but this one's obviously still
used<00:02:04.070> by<00:02:04.190> the<00:02:04.220> railroad<00:02:04.670> because<00:02:04.940> it<00:02:05.090> has

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
used by the railroad because it has

00:02:06.010 --> 00:03:07.490 
used by the railroad because it has
brand-new<00:02:07.010> cross<00:02:07.190> ties<00:02:07.520> on

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.840 

looks<00:03:08.500> like<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:08.830> mechanism<00:03:09.490> right<00:03:09.610> there

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
looks like that mechanism right there

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.030 
looks like that mechanism right there
unlocked<00:03:10.270> it<00:03:10.480> so<00:03:10.660> it<00:03:10.810> could<00:03:12.030> pivot
