short and simple glitch yeah so what so
what<00:00:25.019> this<00:00:25.140> glitch<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.529> about<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.279> on<00:00:26.640> scene

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
what this glitch is about is on scene

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.650 
what this glitch is about is on scene
Carlson<00:00:27.660> these<00:00:28.199> trees<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:29.580> big<00:00:29.820> trunk<00:00:30.210> trees

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
Carlson these trees the big trunk trees

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.400 
Carlson these trees the big trunk trees
like<00:00:30.990> this<00:00:31.199> one<00:00:32.480> sometimes<00:00:33.480> will<00:00:33.930> glitch<00:00:34.170> up

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
like this one sometimes will glitch up

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.190 
like this one sometimes will glitch up
when<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.680> put<00:00:34.860> c4<00:00:35.370> on<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.820> boil<00:00:36.300> but<00:00:36.690> see<00:00:36.960> the

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
when you put c4 on and boil but see the

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.139 
when you put c4 on and boil but see the
first<00:00:37.440> time<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.710> tried<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.370> didn't<00:00:38.640> work

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
first time I tried it it didn't work

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.930 
first time I tried it it didn't work
we<00:00:39.719> ended<00:00:39.840> up<00:00:40.020> blowing<00:00:40.260> up<00:00:40.530> all<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.250> trees<00:00:41.550> in

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
we ended up blowing up all the trees in

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.510 
we ended up blowing up all the trees in
this<00:00:42.149> area<00:00:42.390> I'm<00:00:42.930> until<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.559> noticed<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.160> last

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
this area I'm until I noticed this last

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.170 
this area I'm until I noticed this last
one<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:44.850> we<00:00:45.149> didn't<00:00:45.539> blow<00:00:45.719> up<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:47.180> was

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
one that we didn't blow up so I was

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.900 
one that we didn't blow up so I was
about<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.570> just<00:00:48.840> say<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.860> we're<00:00:50.399> not<00:00:50.610> gonna<00:00:50.760> get

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
about to just say it we're not gonna get

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.720 
about to just say it we're not gonna get

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
um the see how my c4 goes through the

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.270 
um the see how my c4 goes through the
tree<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.930> don't<00:01:01.170> not<00:01:01.680> supposed<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.070> do<00:01:02.250> that

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
tree you don't not supposed to do that

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.530 
tree you don't not supposed to do that
but<00:01:02.899> as<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:03.930> see<00:01:04.229> right<00:01:04.409> here<00:01:05.090> the<00:01:06.090> tree<00:01:06.360> did

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
but as you see right here the tree did

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.280 
but as you see right here the tree did
not<00:01:06.750> fall<00:01:07.080> but<00:01:07.409> only<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:08.130> fail<00:01:08.810> so<00:01:09.810> now<00:01:09.990> watch

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
not fall but only on fail so now watch

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.910 
not fall but only on fail so now watch
when<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.619> point<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.979> c-4<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.670> tree<00:01:12.920> it

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
when I point the c-4 on the tree it

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.010 
when I point the c-4 on the tree it
don't<00:01:14.850> actually<00:01:15.000> go<00:01:15.330> on<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.810> trunk<00:01:18.020> miles

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
don't actually go on the trunk miles

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.840 
don't actually go on the trunk miles
wait<00:01:19.320> for<00:01:19.530> me<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.740> record<00:01:20.070> must<00:01:20.310> see<00:01:20.610> how<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
wait for me to record must see how the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.340 
wait for me to record must see how the
c4<00:01:21.540> just<00:01:21.960> like<00:01:22.140> sticks<00:01:22.650> out<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:24.290> this<00:01:25.290> is

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
c4 just like sticks out of it this is

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.660 
c4 just like sticks out of it this is
what<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.710> want<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.159> tree<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.490> do<00:01:28.070> see<00:01:29.070> yeah

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
what you want the tree to do see yeah

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.690 
what you want the tree to do see yeah
you<00:01:29.729> blow<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.390> up<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:31.320> now<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.009> should<00:01:32.549> be

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
you blow it up and now you should be

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.340 
you blow it up and now you should be
able<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.939> get<00:01:33.119> inside<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.750> tree<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.020> can't

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
able to get inside the tree I can't

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.609 
able to get inside the tree I can't
guarantee<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:35.009> will<00:01:35.159> work<00:01:35.310> every<00:01:36.119> time<00:01:36.619> but

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
guarantee this will work every time but

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.940 
guarantee this will work every time but
it<00:01:38.490> worked<00:01:38.790> for<00:01:38.909> me<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.689> very<00:01:39.869> last<00:01:40.200> tree

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
it worked for me on the very last tree

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.060 
it worked for me on the very last tree
that<00:01:41.310> found<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.150> could<00:01:42.299> try<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.920> so<00:01:43.920> as<00:01:43.979> you

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
that found and could try it on so as you

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.389 
that found and could try it on so as you
see<00:01:44.390> it'll<00:01:45.390> it'll<00:01:45.810> try<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.049> eject<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.100> out<00:01:47.280> of

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
see it'll it'll try to eject you out of

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.170 
see it'll it'll try to eject you out of
this<00:01:47.549> tree

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
this tree

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.480 
this tree
so<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.750> just<00:01:48.899> gotta<00:01:49.110> keep<00:01:49.350> forcing<00:01:50.159> yourself

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
so you just gotta keep forcing yourself

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.020 
so you just gotta keep forcing yourself
in<00:01:51.060> until<00:01:51.810> it'll<00:01:52.079> hold<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.530> like<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.880> now

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
in until it'll hold you like this so now

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.639 
in until it'll hold you like this so now
I'm<00:01:54.180> waiting<00:01:54.479> for<00:01:54.509> Thomas<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.049> get<00:01:55.290> over<00:01:55.500> here

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
cannot kill me through the tree as you

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.319 
cannot kill me through the tree as you
see<00:02:01.020> he's<00:02:01.229> shooting<00:02:01.680> at<00:02:01.829> me<00:02:01.979> he's<00:02:02.909> an<00:02:03.149> enemy
