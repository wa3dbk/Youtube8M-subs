00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:03.770
 There are about 50 students who annually in the main study painting 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.930
 Well, half of them are trying to make money with the art of making money 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.669
 from normal also in the course targeted for exhibitions 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:13.129
 others are there for their own pleasure 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.680
 who has already attended courses at the European Art Academy 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:20.660
 meanwhile, he has convinced in the course it is about the own style of the 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.169
 Recognizing and promoting painters is therefore most important to the patient 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.249
 the discussion in the workplace with the respective 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:28.749
 Students here 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:32.529
 Of course we also meet in the group being with a group of 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.570
 28 is often not so easy, then the percent loose 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.940
 Conversation that comes about by chance about God and the world and art 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.980
 and that's what makes Elmshorn all the harder in such a big group 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.310
 Of course, it also occurs in small groups 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.460
 the people are also he then undertook course then in discussion sit then times 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.650
 three or four at tables and discuss will fit there I come 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.010
 Of course, like to and then it is talked about more general 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.839
 There are no requirements in the main study 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:05.930
 The students should only bring their own topic 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.140
 Waltraud councilman Scalzo has been painting several times at the main study 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.550
 IT this time rides over land now missing in nature 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.470
 photographed and processed excerpts into pictures 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.860
 the criticism of the discreet is very helpful also for one's own work too 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.010
 home 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.130
 she always took something from the courses, even if every lecturer 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.740
 different worker 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.880
 sometimes thats for example 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.920
 the documentary is let to the picture 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.520
 then you also learn the answers the picture layout and so on 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.670
 on loans again more emphasis on first time actually on the Aach 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.760
 sketch 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.760
 and that means there are two installations then, for example 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.180
 in some patients unclear it should also be as many times as 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.200
 Something she gives her dog 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.110
 others can also argue at the main beach of painting 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.909
 Interested parties participate several times 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.660
 the artist changes his direction so no discreet accompany this change 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.870
 It is important for the European Art Academy that the lecturers are experienced 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.700
 we will employ here only one skilled artist one 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.920
 traded additional training forester craftsman or 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.350
 As arts pedagogue Regina all our instructors are teachers have drive 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.739
 so been teaching for several years 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.599
 and not just here with us but also at colleges at stately 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:22.879
 Academies 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.620
 in part, the professors and Meyer play at the bauhaus university Weimar 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.560
 We work together with them or with 4 percent at the other partner city 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:33.069
 six weeks, the main study painting 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.929
 At the end, all students present their works 

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:39.209
 Applications for the autumn 2007 course are already accepted 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.079
