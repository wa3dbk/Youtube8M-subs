00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.039 
other people so I've always got two
things<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:53.579> gives<00:01:53.939> some<00:01:54.240> default<00:01:54.750> ones

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
things and it gives some default ones

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.530 
things and it gives some default ones
that<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.680> could<00:01:55.829> choose<00:01:56.009> from<00:01:56.070> like<00:01:56.969> black

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
that you could choose from like black

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.740 
that you could choose from like black
glow<00:01:58.229> hot<00:01:59.009> pink<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.700> ice

glow hot pink and ice

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.709 
glow hot pink and ice
