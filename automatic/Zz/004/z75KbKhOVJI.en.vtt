hello friends I went up to this video
today<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:14.759> have<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.089> tell<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.480> little<00:00:15.929> trick

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
today I have to tell you a little trick

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.689 
today I have to tell you a little trick
and<00:00:16.500> that<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:16.949> not<00:00:17.100> really<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.310> trick<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.670> a

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
and that is not really a trick is a

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.970 
and that is not really a trick is a
function<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.480> camera<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.529> there<00:00:19.770> but

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
function of the camera that is there but

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.710 
function of the camera that is there but
it's<00:00:20.189> not<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:20.550> obvious<00:00:20.580> at<00:00:21.150> least<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.570> was<00:00:21.689> not

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
it's not so obvious at least it was not

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.660 
it's not so obvious at least it was not
so<00:00:21.960> obvious<00:00:22.199> for<00:00:22.350> me<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.400> how<00:00:23.430> to

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
so obvious for me and that is how to

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.599 
so obvious for me and that is how to
have<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.660> zoom<00:00:25.019> or<00:00:25.289> zoom<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:25.710> or<00:00:25.830> out<00:00:26.010> in<00:00:26.340> your

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
have a zoom or zoom in or out in your

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.400 
have a zoom or zoom in or out in your
pictures<00:00:27.090> that's<00:00:27.689> pretty<00:00:27.930> cool<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.289> an

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
pictures that's pretty cool is an

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.679 
pictures that's pretty cool is an
awesome<00:00:28.800> feature<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.340> again<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.420> had<00:00:30.570> to

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
awesome feature that I again I had to

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.120 
awesome feature that I again I had to
admit<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:31.050> didn't<00:00:31.320> know<00:00:31.439> about<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.740> until

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
admit I didn't know about it until

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.970 
admit I didn't know about it until
recently<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.930> -<00:00:34.170> let's<00:00:34.469> just<00:00:34.649> go<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.829> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
recently so and - let's just go to the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.310 
recently so and - let's just go to the
camera<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.480> have<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> low<00:00:36.809> battery<00:00:36.960> here

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
camera and I have a low battery here

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.380 
camera and I have a low battery here
let's<00:00:37.800> open<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.160> camera<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:39.059> opens<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
let's open the camera and this opens the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
camera and I'm going to just move it to

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.490 
camera and I'm going to just move it to
the<00:00:42.030> landscape<00:00:42.480> mode<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.230> see<00:00:43.410> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
the landscape mode so you see the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.139 
the landscape mode so you see the
comment<00:00:43.800> now<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.040> kind<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.460> focused<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.000> that

would do when you want to make a zoom in

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.540 
would do when you want to make a zoom in
Safari<00:00:54.420> or<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.110> webpage<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:56.010> it's<00:00:56.430> pretty

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
Safari or in a webpage so it's pretty

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.310 
Safari or in a webpage so it's pretty
simple<00:00:56.760> just<00:00:57.149> go<00:00:57.300> ahead<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.690> do<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:57.930> this

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
simple just go ahead and do like this

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.160 
simple just go ahead and do like this
and<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:58.949> see<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.399> zoom<00:00:59.579> started<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.420> if

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
and you see that it zoom started and if

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.529 
and you see that it zoom started and if
you<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> nice<00:01:01.949> zoom<00:01:02.460> bar<00:01:02.670> here<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.090> goes

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
you have a nice zoom bar here that goes

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.170 
you have a nice zoom bar here that goes
from<00:01:03.750> minus<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.170> plus<00:01:04.379> indicating<00:01:05.220> how<00:01:06.030> much

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
from minus to plus indicating how much

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.210 
from minus to plus indicating how much
zoom<00:01:06.540> you're<00:01:06.780> applying<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.590> think<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.100> up

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
zoom you're applying to it I think is up

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.910 
zoom you're applying to it I think is up
to<00:01:08.340> 5x<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.150> maybe<00:01:09.570> mistaken<00:01:09.840> but<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.470> think

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
to 5x and maybe mistaken but I think

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.800 
to 5x and maybe mistaken but I think
that's<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.280> maximum<00:01:11.520> zoom<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.299> it's<00:01:12.600> pretty

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
that's the maximum zoom and it's pretty

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.649 
that's the maximum zoom and it's pretty
cool<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.200> see<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:14.040> camera<00:01:14.250> it's<00:01:14.729> kind

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
cool you see that the camera it's kind

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.320 
cool you see that the camera it's kind
of<00:01:15.720> focusing<00:01:16.290> really<00:01:16.830> well<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.610> see<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> DD

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
of focusing really well you see a DD

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.620 
of focusing really well you see a DD
focus<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:19.759> square<00:01:20.759> has<00:01:21.030> just<00:01:21.330> appeared

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
focus in square has just appeared

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.539 
focus in square has just appeared
indicating<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.439> camera<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.830> focused<00:01:23.310> on

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
indicating that the camera is focused on

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.030 
indicating that the camera is focused on
that<00:01:24.030> object<00:01:24.299> on<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.659> circle<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.350> it's

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
that object on that circle and it's

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.539 
that object on that circle and it's
pretty<00:01:26.250> cool<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.840> my<00:01:28.560> hand<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.920> shaking

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
pretty cool so and my hand is shaking

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.510 
pretty cool so and my hand is shaking
but<00:01:29.850> not<00:01:30.420> as<00:01:30.540> much<00:01:30.750> as<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.049> think<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.829> it's

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
but not as much as you think is it's

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.190 
but not as much as you think is it's
kind<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.729> noticeable<00:01:33.210> on<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.479> camera<00:01:33.780> because

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
kind of noticeable on the camera because

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.399 
kind of noticeable on the camera because
we<00:01:35.189> have<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.369> really<00:01:35.759> strong<00:01:35.820> zoom<00:01:36.240> applied<00:01:36.840> now

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
we have a really strong zoom applied now

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.800 
we have a really strong zoom applied now
to<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.400> vibrations<00:01:39.270> are<00:01:39.450> magnified

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
to it so that vibrations are magnified

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.260 
to it so that vibrations are magnified
but<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.710> doesn't<00:01:41.040> really<00:01:41.130> affect<00:01:41.970> the

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
but that doesn't really affect the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.270 
but that doesn't really affect the
quality<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.750> picture<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.560> camera<00:01:43.920> snaps

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
quality of the picture the camera snaps

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.560 
quality of the picture the camera snaps
and<00:01:44.640> I'm<00:01:44.790> going<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.000> show<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.270> picture

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
and I'm going to show you the picture

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.200 
and I'm going to show you the picture
it's<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.200> really<00:01:46.530> nice<00:01:46.710> clear<00:01:47.159> picture<00:01:47.579> again<00:01:48.119> I

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
it's a really nice clear picture again I
