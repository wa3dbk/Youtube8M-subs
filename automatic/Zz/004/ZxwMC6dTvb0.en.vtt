on<00:00:03.090> my<00:00:04.250> the<00:00:05.250> max<00:00:05.460> back<00:00:05.700> pump<00:00:05.940> pumps<00:00:06.330> here<00:00:06.509> I

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
on my the max back pump pumps here I

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.110 
on my the max back pump pumps here I
ended<00:00:07.830> up<00:00:07.859> getting<00:00:08.160> two<00:00:08.340> of<00:00:08.370> these<00:00:08.550> originally

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
ended up getting two of these originally

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.910 
ended up getting two of these originally
my<00:00:09.240> plan<00:00:09.269> was<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.780> put<00:00:09.900> one<00:00:10.110> in<00:00:10.260> this<00:00:10.349> tank<00:00:10.620> and

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
my plan was to put one in this tank and

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.350 
my plan was to put one in this tank and
one<00:00:11.130> in<00:00:12.019> my<00:00:13.019> 300<00:00:13.500> gallon<00:00:13.710> tank<00:00:14.000> but<00:00:15.000> one<00:00:15.120> thing

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
one in my 300 gallon tank but one thing

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.060 
one in my 300 gallon tank but one thing
is<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:16.310> these<00:00:17.310> pumps<00:00:17.820> are<00:00:18.000> pretty<00:00:18.630> wide<00:00:19.039> so<00:00:20.039> I

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
is that these pumps are pretty wide so I

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.859 
is that these pumps are pretty wide so I
couldn't<00:00:20.580> mount<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:21.000> easily<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:21.570> my<00:00:21.630> three

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
couldn't mount it easily in my three

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:22.910 
couldn't mount it easily in my three
grand<00:00:22.080> gallon<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.380> only<00:00:22.500> way<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.650> could<00:00:22.769> mount

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
grand gallon the only way I could mount

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.170 
grand gallon the only way I could mount
and<00:00:23.130> my<00:00:23.250> good<00:00:23.400> friend<00:00:23.730> gallon<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.439> vertically

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
and my good friend gallon is vertically

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.910 
and my good friend gallon is vertically
and<00:00:28.609> I<00:00:29.609> didn't<00:00:30.119> want<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.330> do<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.599> because

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
and I didn't want to do that because

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.290 
and I didn't want to do that because
that<00:00:31.920> part<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.430> white<00:00:32.550> tank<00:00:32.850> had<00:00:33.149> to

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
that part of the white tank had to

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.959 
that part of the white tank had to
essentially<00:00:33.780> take<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.170> pump<00:00:34.410> out<00:00:34.670> and<00:00:35.670> clean

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
essentially take the pump out and clean

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.990 
essentially take the pump out and clean
the<00:00:36.000> glass<00:00:36.390> right<00:00:36.719> through<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:38.309> really

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
the glass right through and I really

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.240 
the glass right through and I really
like<00:00:39.360> one<00:00:39.660> thing<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.930> do<00:00:39.989> like<00:00:40.320> about<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.950> W

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
like one thing I do like about the W

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.170 
like one thing I do like about the W
p-40s<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.329> but<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.899> MP<00:00:43.140> for<00:00:43.170> T's<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.770> that

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
p-40s is that but the MP for T's is that

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.459 
p-40s is that but the MP for T's is that
you<00:00:45.180> know<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.360> just<00:00:45.570> basically<00:00:45.840> take<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.320> wet

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
you know you just basically take the wet

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.910 
you know you just basically take the wet
side<00:00:46.680> off<00:00:47.420> move<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.809> dry<00:00:49.350> side<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.649> little<00:00:49.829> bit

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
side off move the dry side a little bit

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.450 
side off move the dry side a little bit
and<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.219> put<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.960> an<00:00:51.960> algae<00:00:52.320> magnet<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.250> I

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
and you put a an algae magnet in and I

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.130 
and you put a an algae magnet in and I
would<00:00:53.579> use<00:00:53.699> magnet<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:54.840> basically

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
would use magnet and just basically

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.610 
would use magnet and just basically
clean<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:56.660> with<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.079> would<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.410> mess

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
clean it with this I would have to mess

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.990 
clean it with this I would have to mess
with<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.829> cabling<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.430> all<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.820> just

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
with the cabling and all that and I just

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.889 
with the cabling and all that and I just
didn't<00:01:00.149> wanna<00:01:00.270> deal<00:01:00.420> with<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.690> so

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
didn't wanna deal with that so

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.599 
didn't wanna deal with that so
originally<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.739> was<00:01:01.890> gonna<00:01:01.980> try<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.190> mount<00:01:02.460> it

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
originally I was gonna try to mount it

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.130 
originally I was gonna try to mount it
on<00:01:02.730> my<00:01:02.879> overflow<00:01:03.420> which<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.780> don't<00:01:03.960> have<00:01:04.049> to

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
on my overflow which I don't have to

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.570 
on my overflow which I don't have to
clean<00:01:04.320> obviously<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:05.040> then<00:01:05.129> just<00:01:05.309> leave<00:01:05.460> it

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
clean obviously and then just leave it

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.109 
clean obviously and then just leave it
there<00:01:05.760> but<00:01:07.460> it<00:01:08.460> just<00:01:08.610> didn't<00:01:08.850> work<00:01:08.880> out

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
there but it just didn't work out

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.030 
there but it just didn't work out
because<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:09.540> pretty<00:01:09.810> wide<00:01:09.930> my<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.770> prank

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
because it's pretty wide my this prank

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.580 
because it's pretty wide my this prank
tank<00:01:11.280> here<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.700> 4<00:01:12.240> feet<00:01:12.420> by<00:01:12.479> 2<00:01:12.750> feet<00:01:12.900> by<00:01:13.320> 12

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
tank here is 4 feet by 2 feet by 12

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.390 
tank here is 4 feet by 2 feet by 12
inches<00:01:13.830> tall<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:15.150> it's<00:01:15.780> pretty<00:01:15.930> not<00:01:16.770> very<00:01:16.950> not

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
inches tall so it's pretty not very not

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.600 
inches tall so it's pretty not very not
very<00:01:17.900> tall<00:01:19.280> so<00:01:21.380> and<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:23.250> one<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.549> the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
very tall so and that is one of the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.130 
very tall so and that is one of the
problems<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:23.970> had<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.390> tank<00:01:24.630> before<00:01:24.780> is

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
problems I had in this tank before is

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.560 
problems I had in this tank before is
that<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.560> had<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:27.770> MPs<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:28.979> here<00:01:29.280> 2<00:01:29.970> MP<00:01:30.180> tens<00:01:30.420> on

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
that I had the MPs in here 2 MP tens on

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.300 
that I had the MPs in here 2 MP tens on
this<00:01:30.720> side<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.259> if<00:01:31.439> before<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.860> on<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.100> side

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
this side and if before you on that side

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.370 
this side and if before you on that side
and<00:01:32.610> one<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.479> challenge<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.930> those<00:01:34.110> kind

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
and one of the challenge of those kind

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.840 
and one of the challenge of those kind
of<00:01:34.470> pumps<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.950> can't<00:01:35.189> mount<00:01:35.369> them<00:01:35.640> very

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
of pumps is you can't mount them very

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.999 
of pumps is you can't mount them very
high<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.509> end<00:01:37.049> up<00:01:37.290> putting<00:01:37.470> about<00:01:37.799> halfway

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
high so end up putting about halfway

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.010 
high so end up putting about halfway
down<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.340> tank<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.880> then<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.659> case<00:01:39.869> I

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
down the tank and then in that case I

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.480 
down the tank and then in that case I
could<00:01:40.079> really<00:01:40.409> crank<00:01:40.890> them<00:01:41.040> way<00:01:41.189> up<00:01:41.220> because

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
could really crank them way up because

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.810 
could really crank them way up because
they<00:01:41.729> were<00:01:41.790> blasting<00:01:42.329> everything<00:01:42.619> so<00:01:43.820> so

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
they were blasting everything so so

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.910 
they were blasting everything so so
that's<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.750> these<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.350> have<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:46.740> one

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
that's that so these I have this one

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.770 
that's that so these I have this one
mounted<00:01:47.189> about<00:01:47.340> 2<00:01:47.490> inches<00:01:47.759> down<00:01:48.030> it's<00:01:48.479> towards

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
mounted about 2 inches down it's towards

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.510 
mounted about 2 inches down it's towards
the<00:01:48.869> back<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> little<00:01:49.290> bit<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.220> one<00:01:50.430> is

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
the back a little bit and this one is

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.429 
the back a little bit and this one is
probably<00:01:50.610> about<00:01:50.820> 3<00:01:51.119> inch<00:01:51.299> 3/4<00:01:51.990> inches<00:01:52.259> down

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
probably about 3 inch 3/4 inches down

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.810 
probably about 3 inch 3/4 inches down
and<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:52.829> towards<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.159> front<00:01:53.399> so<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.579> offset

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
and it's towards the front so I offset

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.179 
and it's towards the front so I offset
them<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.299> little<00:01:54.570> bit<00:01:54.689> just<00:01:54.720> thinking<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:56.159> I

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
them a little bit just thinking that I

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.679 
them a little bit just thinking that I
didn't<00:01:56.640> want<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.939> opposing<00:01:57.329> photo<00:01:57.540> to

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
didn't want the opposing photo to

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.230 
didn't want the opposing photo to
collide<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.320> each<00:01:58.409> other<00:01:59.090> first<00:02:00.090> thing<00:02:00.210> I

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
collide to each other first thing I

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.560 
collide to each other first thing I
wanna<00:02:00.390> show<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:02.030> this<00:02:03.030> mode<00:02:03.390> here<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:05.570> the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
wanna show you is this mode here is the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.029 
wanna show you is this mode here is the
pump<00:02:06.810> running<00:02:07.020> in<00:02:07.170> Reverse<00:02:07.469> they're<00:02:07.890> what

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
pump running in Reverse they're what

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.619 
pump running in Reverse they're what
they<00:02:08.160> call<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.399> guess<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.819> gyre<00:02:09.060> mode<00:02:09.420> or

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
they call I guess the gyre mode or

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.089 
they call I guess the gyre mode or
something<00:02:09.720> like<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:10.020> where<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:10.979> goes

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
something like that where it goes

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.290 
something like that where it goes
forward<00:02:11.489> for<00:02:11.640> X<00:02:11.849> minutes

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
forward for X minutes

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.560 
forward for X minutes
it<00:02:12.450> goes<00:02:12.570> to<00:02:12.690> reverse<00:02:12.990> an<00:02:13.230> X<00:02:13.530> minute<00:02:14.420> you<00:02:15.420> can

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
it goes to reverse an X minute you can

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.390 
it goes to reverse an X minute you can
see<00:02:15.720> there's<00:02:15.960> minimal<00:02:16.200> flow<00:02:16.560> this<00:02:16.860> is<00:02:16.920> reverse

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
see there's minimal flow this is reverse

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.500 
see there's minimal flow this is reverse
in<00:02:17.670> full<00:02:17.910> full<00:02:18.300> black<00:02:18.510> sorry<00:02:19.470> full<00:02:19.740> glass<00:02:20.510> so

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
in full full black sorry full glass so

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.360 
in full full black sorry full glass so
minimal<00:02:21.930> amount<00:02:22.080> of<00:02:22.140> flow<00:02:22.350> I'll<00:02:23.040> come<00:02:23.250> down

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
minimal amount of flow I'll come down

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.940 
minimal amount of flow I'll come down
here<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:23.760> can<00:02:23.880> look<00:02:24.030> at<00:02:24.210> it<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.480> is<00:02:24.950> pushing

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
here you can look at it it is pushing

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.590 
here you can look at it it is pushing
some<00:02:26.130> water<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.610> can<00:02:26.730> see<00:02:26.940> that's<00:02:27.330> on<00:02:27.510> the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
some water you can see that's on the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.810 
some water you can see that's on the
course<00:02:27.840> move<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.290> around<00:02:28.380> there<00:02:28.740> clearly<00:02:29.610> it's

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
course move it around there clearly it's

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.550 
course move it around there clearly it's
coming<00:02:30.150> kind<00:02:30.360> of<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.570> is<00:02:31.050> a<00:02:31.170> little<00:02:31.470> bit

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
coming kind of that is a little bit

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.280 
coming kind of that is a little bit
diagonally<00:02:31.770> down<00:02:32.450> maybe<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:33.600> saw<00:02:33.990> I<00:02:34.020> don't

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
diagonally down maybe you saw I don't

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.410 
diagonally down maybe you saw I don't
know<00:02:34.380> stirring<00:02:34.770> stuff<00:02:34.950> up<00:02:35.190> down<00:02:35.880> below<00:02:36.030> here

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
know stirring stuff up down below here

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.910 
know stirring stuff up down below here
but<00:02:36.600> certainly<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:37.050> give<00:02:37.260> up<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.560> heck<00:02:37.710> of<00:02:37.830> a

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
but certainly you give up a heck of a

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.580 
but certainly you give up a heck of a
lot<00:02:38.070> of<00:02:38.190> flow<00:02:38.400> there<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:39.780> be<00:02:40.170> in<00:02:40.410> this

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
lot of flow there to be in this

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.440 
lot of flow there to be in this
essential<00:02:41.130> reverse<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.880> that<00:02:42.000> makes<00:02:42.210> sense

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
essential reverse and that makes sense

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.850 
essential reverse and that makes sense
this<00:02:42.630> coral<00:02:42.960> cage<00:02:43.170> is<00:02:43.380> definitely<00:02:43.770> a

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
this coral cage is definitely a

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.380 
this coral cage is definitely a
directional<00:02:44.610> thing<00:02:45.320> so<00:02:46.910> I'll<00:02:47.910> wait<00:02:48.090> for<00:02:48.240> it<00:02:48.300> to

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
directional thing so I'll wait for it to

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.960 
directional thing so I'll wait for it to
switch<00:02:48.600> back<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:49.050> forward<00:02:49.320> mode<00:02:50.100> so<00:02:50.940> you

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
switch back to the forward mode so you

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.520 
switch back to the forward mode so you
can<00:02:51.180> see<00:02:51.360> what<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:51.570> looks<00:02:51.750> like<00:02:51.810> this<00:02:52.290> is

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
can see what it looks like this is

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.750 
can see what it looks like this is
running<00:02:52.800> full<00:02:52.980> glass<00:02:53.250> in<00:02:53.790> both<00:02:54.030> directions<00:02:54.560> so

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
running full glass in both directions so

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.640 
running full glass in both directions so
be<00:02:56.760> quiet<00:02:57.060> in<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.420> reverse<00:02:57.780> for<00:02:58.320> about<00:02:58.470> two

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
be quiet in the reverse for about two

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.930 
be quiet in the reverse for about two
minutes

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
minutes

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.580 
minutes
watch<00:03:00.480> my<00:03:00.690> clownfish<00:03:01.680> here<00:03:02.750> that<00:03:03.750> kicks<00:03:03.990> on<00:03:04.230> I

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
watch my clownfish here that kicks on I

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.110 
watch my clownfish here that kicks on I
will<00:03:05.430> tell<00:03:05.640> you<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.210> flow<00:03:06.630> is<00:03:08.120> pretty

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
will tell you the the flow is pretty

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.380 
will tell you the the flow is pretty
linear<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.780> flat<00:03:10.020> so<00:03:10.550> you<00:03:11.550> can<00:03:11.730> I<00:03:11.970> think

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
linear and flat so you can I think

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.300 
linear and flat so you can I think
you'll<00:03:12.540> be<00:03:12.690> able<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.870> clearly<00:03:13.110> see<00:03:13.440> it'll<00:03:14.070> pick

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
you'll be able to clearly see it'll pick

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.699 
you'll be able to clearly see it'll pick
up<00:03:14.430> a<00:03:14.550> bunch<00:03:14.760> of<00:03:14.880> chunk<00:03:15.240> because<00:03:16.110> what<00:03:16.290> happens

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
up a bunch of chunk because what happens

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.650 
up a bunch of chunk because what happens
is<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.160> stuff<00:03:17.400> settles<00:03:17.790> back<00:03:17.970> down<00:03:20.660> settles

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
is the stuff settles back down settles

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.150 
is the stuff settles back down settles
back<00:03:21.810> now<00:03:22.020> and<00:03:22.260> when<00:03:22.350> it<00:03:22.440> cranks<00:03:22.770> back<00:03:22.800> up

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
back now and when it cranks back up

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.500 
back now and when it cranks back up
they'll<00:03:23.370> pick<00:03:23.580> it<00:03:23.700> up<00:03:23.820> and<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:24.090> gives<00:03:24.270> you<00:03:24.390> the

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
they'll pick it up and it gives you the

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.420 
they'll pick it up and it gives you the
impression<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:25.200> think<00:03:25.920> that<00:03:26.010> it's<00:03:26.130> picking<00:03:26.280> up

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
impression I think that it's picking up

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.510 
impression I think that it's picking up
all<00:03:26.580> this<00:03:26.670> extra<00:03:26.970> stuff<00:03:27.239> with<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:28.160> yeah<00:03:29.160> it

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
all this extra stuff with it yeah it

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.190 
all this extra stuff with it yeah it
definitely<00:03:29.640> does<00:03:29.880> a<00:03:30.000> better<00:03:30.239> job<00:03:30.510> keeping<00:03:30.930> the

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
definitely does a better job keeping the

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.680 
definitely does a better job keeping the
bottom<00:03:31.500> of<00:03:31.590> my<00:03:31.709> tank<00:03:31.980> clean<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:32.520> would<00:03:33.180> say<00:03:33.300> I'll

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
bottom of my tank clean I would say I'll

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:34.460 
bottom of my tank clean I would say I'll
give<00:03:33.840> it<00:03:33.959> that

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
give it that

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.910 
give it that
it<00:03:34.950> goes<00:03:36.290> and<00:03:37.290> you<00:03:37.350> can<00:03:37.770> see<00:03:39.350> the<00:03:40.350> fish<00:03:40.560> react

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
it goes and you can see the fish react

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.840 
it goes and you can see the fish react
there<00:03:41.190> I<00:03:41.430> think<00:03:41.790> because<00:03:42.209> of<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.390> linear<00:03:43.080> flow

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
there I think because of the linear flow

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.229 
there I think because of the linear flow
pattern<00:03:44.850> the<00:03:45.570> fish<00:03:45.750> do<00:03:46.020> seem<00:03:46.380> to<00:03:47.030> don't<00:03:48.030> mind

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
pattern the fish do seem to don't mind

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:54.089 
pattern the fish do seem to don't mind
the<00:03:48.420> direct<00:03:49.110> car<00:03:49.320> as<00:03:49.590> much

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:55.770 

they're<00:03:54.640> stirring<00:03:54.909> up<00:03:55.090> quite<00:03:55.299> a<00:03:55.329> bit<00:03:55.510> you<00:03:55.659> can

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
they're stirring up quite a bit you can

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.110 
they're stirring up quite a bit you can
see<00:03:55.810> um<00:03:56.459> doesn't<00:03:57.459> create<00:03:57.579> a<00:03:57.670> necessarily<00:03:58.090> a

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
see um doesn't create a necessarily a

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.809 
see um doesn't create a necessarily a
lot<00:03:58.150> of<00:03:58.359> vortex<00:03:59.010> action<00:04:00.010> but<00:04:00.159> man<00:04:00.430> there's<00:04:00.730> a

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
lot of vortex action but man there's a

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.630 
lot of vortex action but man there's a
lot<00:04:01.000> of<00:04:01.180> a<00:04:01.209> lot<00:04:01.569> of<00:04:01.599> flow<00:04:01.870> there<00:04:02.280> I'm<00:04:03.280> surprised

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
lot of a lot of flow there I'm surprised

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.949 
lot of a lot of flow there I'm surprised
I'm<00:04:03.760> not<00:04:03.819> splashing<00:04:04.329> water<00:04:04.480> all<00:04:04.780> over<00:04:04.810> the

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
I'm not splashing water all over the

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.349 
I'm not splashing water all over the
place<00:04:05.019> in<00:04:05.379> this<00:04:05.469> tank<00:04:05.969> having<00:04:06.969> it<00:04:07.060> to<00:04:07.180> smote

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
place in this tank having it to smote

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:08.610 
place in this tank having it to smote
obviously<00:04:07.780> I<00:04:07.810> wouldn't<00:04:08.049> run<00:04:08.170> it<00:04:08.319> like<00:04:08.560> this

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
obviously I wouldn't run it like this

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.349 
obviously I wouldn't run it like this
all<00:04:09.159> the<00:04:09.340> time<00:04:09.549> I<00:04:09.579> just<00:04:09.730> want<00:04:09.909> to<00:04:10.120> show<00:04:10.269> you

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
all the time I just want to show you

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:14.250 
all the time I just want to show you
what<00:04:10.599> the<00:04:10.720> full<00:04:10.900> power<00:04:11.109> looks<00:04:11.409> like<00:04:12.599> and<00:04:13.599> let's

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
what the full power looks like and let's

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:23.189 
what the full power looks like and let's
see<00:04:14.500> you<00:04:14.709> see<00:04:14.950> some<00:04:15.220> stuff<00:04:15.519> being<00:04:15.760> picked<00:04:15.970> up

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:26.129 

so<00:04:23.949> this<00:04:24.340> gives<00:04:24.520> a<00:04:24.759> kind<00:04:25.000> of<00:04:25.120> reference<00:04:25.870> there

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
so this gives a kind of reference there

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.689 
so this gives a kind of reference there
that<00:04:26.919> pump<00:04:27.280> is<00:04:27.610> pretty<00:04:28.710> quite<00:04:29.710> a<00:04:29.740> bit<00:04:29.889> hired

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
that pump is pretty quite a bit hired

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:33.779 
that pump is pretty quite a bit hired
and<00:04:30.970> then<00:04:31.740> where<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:32.830> corals<00:04:33.250> will<00:04:33.400> actually

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
and then where the corals will actually

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:44.520 
and then where the corals will actually
add<00:04:33.970> so

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.850 

okay<00:04:45.190> so<00:04:45.250> there<00:04:45.520> you<00:04:45.610> have<00:04:45.640> it<00:04:45.820> it's<00:04:46.150> the<00:04:46.360> gyro

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
okay so there you have it it's the gyro

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.260 
okay so there you have it it's the gyro
you<00:04:47.860> saw<00:04:48.040> the<00:04:48.100> reversed<00:04:48.490> mode<00:04:48.730> as<00:04:48.910> well<00:04:49.060> as<00:04:49.180> the

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
you saw the reversed mode as well as the

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.270 
you saw the reversed mode as well as the
forward<00:04:49.540> obviously<00:04:50.350> can<00:04:50.710> put<00:04:50.860> these<00:04:50.980> in

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
forward obviously can put these in

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.410 
forward obviously can put these in
impulse<00:04:52.680> which<00:04:53.680> you<00:04:54.010> know<00:04:54.100> just<00:04:54.580> essentially

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
impulse which you know just essentially

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.690 
impulse which you know just essentially
turns<00:04:55.660> it<00:04:55.810> on<00:04:55.900> and<00:04:56.140> off<00:04:56.200> and<00:04:57.190> then<00:04:57.400> I<00:04:57.430> think

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
turns it on and off and then I think

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.870 
turns it on and off and then I think
there's<00:04:57.850> a<00:04:57.910> feed<00:04:58.120> mode<00:04:58.390> and<00:04:58.540> a<00:04:58.570> constant<00:04:59.110> mode

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
there's a feed mode and a constant mode

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.730 
there's a feed mode and a constant mode
this<00:05:00.880> gyro<00:05:01.270> mode<00:05:01.540> I<00:05:01.570> was<00:05:01.930> almost<00:05:02.260> considered

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
this gyro mode I was almost considered

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.770 
this gyro mode I was almost considered
like<00:05:03.010> a<00:05:03.040> long<00:05:03.580> pulse<00:05:03.940> you<00:05:04.330> know<00:05:04.420> about<00:05:04.600> two

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
like a long pulse you know about two

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.580 
like a long pulse you know about two
minutes<00:05:04.990> minimum<00:05:05.590> I<00:05:06.390> can<00:05:07.390> go<00:05:07.510> much<00:05:08.170> longer<00:05:08.560> I

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
minutes minimum I can go much longer I

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.890 
minutes minimum I can go much longer I
sit<00:05:08.890> in<00:05:08.980> that<00:05:09.130> mode<00:05:09.340> I<00:05:09.520> think<00:05:09.720> the<00:05:10.720> way<00:05:10.840> you

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
sit in that mode I think the way you

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.750 
sit in that mode I think the way you
want<00:05:11.260> to<00:05:11.350> do<00:05:11.470> that<00:05:11.680> if<00:05:11.890> you<00:05:11.980> have<00:05:12.070> two<00:05:12.280> pumps<00:05:12.640> is

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
want to do that if you have two pumps is

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.360 
want to do that if you have two pumps is
to<00:05:12.970> offset<00:05:13.360> the<00:05:13.480> timing<00:05:13.930> so<00:05:14.080> that<00:05:14.160> you<00:05:15.160> create

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
to offset the timing so that you create

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.370 
to offset the timing so that you create
some<00:05:15.670> variability<00:05:16.120> in<00:05:16.510> terms<00:05:16.840> of<00:05:17.140> the<00:05:17.200> flow

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
some variability in terms of the flow

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.630 
some variability in terms of the flow
pattern<00:05:18.870> another<00:05:19.870> thing<00:05:20.020> is<00:05:20.200> that<00:05:20.340> up<00:05:21.340> here

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
pattern another thing is that up here

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.830 
pattern another thing is that up here
you<00:05:21.730> can<00:05:21.850> see<00:05:22.030> how<00:05:22.410> the<00:05:23.410> water<00:05:23.560> flows<00:05:24.010> I<00:05:24.840> hope

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
you can see how the water flows I hope

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.580 
you can see how the water flows I hope
the<00:05:25.990> color<00:05:26.200> comes<00:05:26.440> out<00:05:26.590> okay<00:05:28.230> so<00:05:29.230> because<00:05:29.500> I

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
the color comes out okay so because I

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.130 
the color comes out okay so because I
have<00:05:29.710> these<00:05:29.860> two<00:05:30.010> pumps<00:05:30.480> the<00:05:31.480> flow<00:05:31.720> is<00:05:31.870> almost

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
have these two pumps the flow is almost

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.580 
have these two pumps the flow is almost
like<00:05:32.410> in<00:05:32.620> this<00:05:32.800> clockwise<00:05:33.220> direction<00:05:34.590> there

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
like in this clockwise direction there

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.830 
like in this clockwise direction there
you<00:05:35.680> go<00:05:35.770> just<00:05:36.040> kicked<00:05:36.340> into<00:05:36.880> reverse<00:05:37.210> in<00:05:37.600> one

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
you go just kicked into reverse in one

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.980 
you go just kicked into reverse in one
side<00:05:38.610> and<00:05:39.610> I<00:05:39.850> think<00:05:40.060> I'm<00:05:40.210> kicking<00:05:40.540> reversing

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
side and I think I'm kicking reversing

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.100 
side and I think I'm kicking reversing
the<00:05:41.050> other<00:05:41.169> side<00:05:42.360> things<00:05:43.360> settle<00:05:43.690> down<00:05:43.720> quite

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
the other side things settle down quite

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.950 
the other side things settle down quite
a<00:05:44.140> bit

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
a bit

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.860 
a bit
okay<00:05:46.960> this<00:05:47.440> is<00:05:47.500> a<00:05:47.560> video<00:05:47.650> shoot<00:05:48.310> me<00:05:48.490> a<00:05:49.180> PM<00:05:49.720> or

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
okay this is a video shoot me a PM or

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.370 
okay this is a video shoot me a PM or
anything<00:05:50.020> to<00:05:50.200> get<00:05:50.290> any<00:05:50.440> questions<00:05:50.800> thanks<00:05:51.190> bye
