00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.200 

well<00:00:01.920> guys<00:00:02.129> I<00:00:02.490> was<00:00:02.850> able<00:00:03.030> to<00:00:03.480> make<00:00:04.020> my

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:05.210 
well guys I was able to make my

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.509 
well guys I was able to make my
adjustment<00:00:06.210> or<00:00:07.250> reconfiguration<00:00:08.250> I'm<00:00:08.340> not

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
adjustment or reconfiguration I'm not

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.490 
adjustment or reconfiguration I'm not
sure<00:00:08.730> what<00:00:08.910> you<00:00:09.000> want<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.240> call<00:00:09.389> it<00:00:09.599> this<00:00:10.290> is

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
sure what you want to call it this is

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.110 
sure what you want to call it this is
what<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:10.800> did<00:00:11.780> as<00:00:13.280> you<00:00:14.280> can<00:00:14.429> see<00:00:14.639> there's<00:00:14.880> no

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
what I did as you can see there's no

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.680 
what I did as you can see there's no
vortex<00:00:15.420> right<00:00:16.049> there<00:00:17.000> the<00:00:18.000> water<00:00:18.210> goes<00:00:18.480> in

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
vortex right there the water goes in

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.849 
vortex right there the water goes in
here<00:00:19.609> down<00:00:20.609> here<00:00:21.140> through<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.260> dial<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.680> can

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
here down here through the dial I can

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.950 
here down here through the dial I can
adjust<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.490> dial<00:00:23.730> as<00:00:23.939> needed<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.689> get<00:00:24.840> the

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
adjust the dial as needed to get the

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.560 
adjust the dial as needed to get the
bubbles<00:00:25.170> out<00:00:26.210> and<00:00:27.349> you<00:00:28.349> go<00:00:28.500> down<00:00:28.680> here<00:00:28.740> and

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
bubbles out and you go down here and

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:38.600 
bubbles out and you go down here and
then<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.900> exit<00:00:32.090> and<00:00:35.059> uh-oh<00:00:37.129> if<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.370> look

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
then the exit and uh-oh if you look

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.180 
then the exit and uh-oh if you look
really<00:00:39.140> closely<00:00:41.030> here<00:00:42.030> let<00:00:42.390> me<00:00:42.420> get<00:00:42.629> closer<00:00:43.190> if

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
really closely here let me get closer if

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.610 
really closely here let me get closer if
you<00:00:44.309> look<00:00:44.579> really<00:00:44.940> closely<00:00:45.660> there's<00:00:46.260> still<00:00:46.590> a

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
you look really closely there's still a

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.860 
you look really closely there's still a
few<00:00:47.399> bubbles<00:00:49.579> yeah<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.570> didn't<00:00:51.930> work<00:00:52.789> so

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
few bubbles yeah so that didn't work so

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:02.420 
few bubbles yeah so that didn't work so
my<00:00:56.000> thought<00:00:57.000> was<00:00:57.530> I<00:01:00.559> know<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.680> can<00:01:01.980> dial<00:01:02.190> this

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
my thought was I know I can dial this

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.539 
my thought was I know I can dial this
down<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:03.149> get<00:01:03.480> no<00:01:03.780> bubbles<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.739> problem<00:01:05.369> is

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
down and get no bubbles the problem is

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.480 
down and get no bubbles the problem is
when<00:01:06.180> i<00:01:06.210> dial<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.750> beyond<00:01:07.170> let's<00:01:08.040> take<00:01:08.280> this

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
when i dial that beyond let's take this

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.320 
when i dial that beyond let's take this
out<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.970> equation<00:01:09.450> right<00:01:09.479> now<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:10.229> and

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
out of the equation right now this and

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.880 
out of the equation right now this and
this<00:01:12.330> take<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.780> out<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.200> equation<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.740> this

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
this take it out of the equation so this

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.969 
this take it out of the equation so this
is<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> 90<00:01:14.869> right<00:01:15.869> that's<00:01:16.770> 90<00:01:17.780> and<00:01:18.780> that's<00:01:19.470> 90

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
is a 90 right that's 90 and that's 90

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.130 
is a 90 right that's 90 and that's 90
make<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.939> top<00:01:21.150> part<00:01:21.330> out<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.630> equation

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
make that top part out of the equation

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.469 
make that top part out of the equation
if<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.979> can<00:01:23.189> get<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.640> water<00:01:23.909> level<00:01:24.360> up<00:01:24.450> to

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
if I can get that water level up to

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.160 
if I can get that water level up to
there<00:01:24.960> then<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.189> don't<00:01:26.520> have<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:27.630> vortex

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
there then I don't have this vortex

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.980 
there then I don't have this vortex
coming<00:01:28.770> down<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.970> maybe<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.420> can<00:01:30.540> ride<00:01:30.810> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
coming down so maybe I can ride the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.380 
coming down so maybe I can ride the
water<00:01:31.110> level<00:01:31.530> around<00:01:31.770> here<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.520> everything

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
water level around here and everything

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.749 
water level around here and everything
can<00:01:33.540> be<00:01:33.630> fine<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:34.170> know<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:35.009> can<00:01:35.310> do<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.700> know

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
can be fine I know I can do that I know

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.200 
can be fine I know I can do that I know
I<00:01:35.939> can<00:01:36.240> do<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.720> there<00:01:37.140> will<00:01:37.259> be<00:01:37.290> no

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
I can do that and there will be no

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.940 
I can do that and there will be no
bubbles<00:01:39.860> but<00:01:41.360> this<00:01:42.360> gets<00:01:42.540> clogged<00:01:43.049> anything

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
bubbles but this gets clogged anything

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.100 
bubbles but this gets clogged anything
gets<00:01:44.130> clogged<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.670> here<00:01:44.939> it's<00:01:45.450> just<00:01:45.840> too

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
gets clogged in here it's just too

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.109 
gets clogged in here it's just too
unstable<00:01:46.460> this<00:01:47.460> Rises<00:01:48.390> Rises<00:01:48.810> Rises<00:01:49.619> oh<00:01:50.100> hey<00:01:50.850> I

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
unstable this Rises Rises Rises oh hey I

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.149 
unstable this Rises Rises Rises oh hey I
think<00:01:51.479> I'll<00:01:51.600> come<00:01:51.810> right<00:01:52.079> over<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.680> top<00:01:52.890> there

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
think I'll come right over the top there

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.980 
think I'll come right over the top there
yeah<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.149> don't<00:01:54.270> want<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.540> do<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.860> so<00:01:55.860> I

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
yeah I don't want to do that so I

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.149 
yeah I don't want to do that so I
envisioned<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.619> wanted<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.009> have<00:01:59.130> a

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
envisioned that and I wanted to have a

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.760 
envisioned that and I wanted to have a
safety<00:01:59.640> feature<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:01.170> wanted<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.649> have

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
safety feature so I wanted to have

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.730 
safety feature so I wanted to have
basically<00:02:02.159> another<00:02:02.549> pipe<00:02:02.880> here<00:02:03.469> going<00:02:04.469> over

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
basically another pipe here going over

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.779 
basically another pipe here going over
and<00:02:04.920> down<00:02:06.560> but<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.590> tried<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.039> incorporate<00:02:08.459> it

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
and down but I tried to incorporate it

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.070 
and down but I tried to incorporate it
into<00:02:08.940> one

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
into one

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.000 
into one
my<00:02:11.080> mistake<00:02:11.380> was<00:02:12.250> that<00:02:13.060> I<00:02:13.120> assumed<00:02:13.750> this<00:02:14.680> water

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
my mistake was that I assumed this water

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.280 
my mistake was that I assumed this water
level<00:02:16.230> would<00:02:17.230> be<00:02:17.440> here<00:02:18.600> so<00:02:19.600> if<00:02:19.720> I<00:02:19.810> take<00:02:20.050> this

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
level would be here so if I take this

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.970 
level would be here so if I take this
water<00:02:20.620> level<00:02:20.890> up<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:21.850> here<00:02:22.530> this<00:02:23.530> will<00:02:23.770> be<00:02:23.860> up

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
water level up to here this will be up

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.910 
water level up to here this will be up
to<00:02:24.160> here<00:02:24.660> this<00:02:25.660> will<00:02:25.840> all<00:02:26.050> be<00:02:26.260> water<00:02:26.500> through

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
to here this will all be water through

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.150 
to here this will all be water through
here<00:02:26.950> we<00:02:27.280> won't<00:02:27.430> be<00:02:27.610> sucking<00:02:28.090> air<00:02:28.920> go<00:02:29.920> down

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
here we won't be sucking air go down

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.380 
here we won't be sucking air go down
still<00:02:30.820> water<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:33.420> don't<00:02:34.420> know<00:02:34.540> I<00:02:34.840> just<00:02:35.320> I<00:02:35.650> I

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
still water I don't know I just I I

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.110 
still water I don't know I just I I
didn't<00:02:37.390> really<00:02:37.630> factor<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.770> air<00:02:38.980> in<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.910> top

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
didn't really factor the air in the top

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.390 
didn't really factor the air in the top
part<00:02:40.450> into<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.290> equation<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:44.860> it's<00:02:45.070> still

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
part into the equation so it's still

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.360 
part into the equation so it's still
majorly<00:02:46.300> sucking<00:02:46.780> air<00:02:46.990> it's<00:02:47.950> not<00:02:48.040> sucking

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
majorly sucking air it's not sucking

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.630 
majorly sucking air it's not sucking
there<00:02:48.840> it's<00:02:49.840> just<00:02:50.050> sucking<00:02:50.440> here<00:02:50.650> it's<00:02:51.190> fine

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
there it's just sucking here it's fine

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.520 
there it's just sucking here it's fine
it's<00:02:52.180> just<00:02:52.270> getting<00:02:52.570> a<00:02:52.630> plot<00:02:52.840> air<00:02:53.080> from<00:02:53.320> there

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
it's just getting a plot air from there

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:00.570 
it's just getting a plot air from there
this<00:02:54.190> isn't<00:02:54.400> really<00:02:54.730> I<00:02:59.100> can't<00:03:00.100> really<00:03:00.250> see<00:03:00.490> up

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
this isn't really I can't really see up

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:09.570 
this isn't really I can't really see up
there<00:03:00.730> but<00:03:00.940> maybe<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.270> camera<00:03:01.570> can<00:03:01.780> I<00:03:08.580> don't

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
there but maybe the camera can I don't

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.060 
there but maybe the camera can I don't
know<00:03:09.640> what<00:03:09.820> you<00:03:09.940> saw<00:03:10.150> but<00:03:11.080> it<00:03:11.680> looks<00:03:11.860> like<00:03:11.950> a

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
know what you saw but it looks like a

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.540 
know what you saw but it looks like a
lot<00:03:12.310> of<00:03:12.340> bubbling<00:03:13.440> so<00:03:14.440> what<00:03:14.680> I'm<00:03:14.830> going<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.250> do

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
lot of bubbling so what I'm going to do

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:21.710 
lot of bubbling so what I'm going to do
tomorrow<00:03:16.470> not<00:03:17.470> tonight<00:03:17.940> is<00:03:19.230> I'm<00:03:20.230> gonna<00:03:20.380> cut

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
tomorrow not tonight is I'm gonna cut

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.270 
tomorrow not tonight is I'm gonna cut
here<00:03:22.720> and<00:03:23.310> cap<00:03:24.310> it<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.870> I'm<00:03:26.380> gonna<00:03:26.560> cut<00:03:26.830> over

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
here and cap it and I'm gonna cut over

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.280 
here and cap it and I'm gonna cut over
here<00:03:27.610> and<00:03:28.290> cap<00:03:29.290> it<00:03:29.340> so<00:03:30.340> this<00:03:30.959> little<00:03:31.959> bottom

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
here and cap it so this little bottom

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.949 
here and cap it so this little bottom
part<00:03:33.100> will<00:03:33.970> be<00:03:34.090> just<00:03:34.300> independent<00:03:34.870> of

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
part will be just independent of

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.110 
part will be just independent of
everything<00:03:35.260> cuz<00:03:35.680> I<00:03:35.770> know<00:03:35.830> I<00:03:36.070> can<00:03:36.490> do<00:03:36.610> that<00:03:36.760> I

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
everything cuz I know I can do that I

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.440 
everything cuz I know I can do that I
can<00:03:37.630> crank<00:03:37.870> this<00:03:38.880> so<00:03:39.880> you<00:03:39.970> can<00:03:40.120> already<00:03:40.239> hear

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
can crank this so you can already hear

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.750 
can crank this so you can already hear
it<00:03:40.510> get<00:03:41.170> less<00:03:41.440> bubbles<00:03:41.890> let's<00:03:42.459> see<00:03:42.580> when<00:03:42.730> I

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
it get less bubbles let's see when I

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.220 
it get less bubbles let's see when I
crank<00:03:43.060> that<00:03:43.300> see<00:03:43.780> what<00:03:43.900> happens<00:03:44.140> over<00:03:44.260> here

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.380 

it'll<00:03:50.230> go<00:03:50.349> up<00:03:50.439> over<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:50.830> top<00:03:51.010> so<00:03:51.310> we<00:03:52.060> won't<00:03:52.269> do

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
it'll go up over the top so we won't do

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.750 
it'll go up over the top so we won't do
that<00:03:54.060> open<00:03:55.060> that<00:03:55.180> back<00:03:55.360> up<00:03:55.470> suck<00:03:56.470> air<00:03:56.739> and<00:03:57.459> that

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
that open that back up suck air and that

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.530 
that open that back up suck air and that
goes<00:03:57.909> back<00:03:57.939> down<00:03:58.709> so<00:03:59.709> yeah<00:03:59.860> I'm<00:03:59.980> gonna<00:04:00.069> isolate

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
goes back down so yeah I'm gonna isolate

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.759 
goes back down so yeah I'm gonna isolate
this<00:04:01.540> part<00:04:01.840> of<00:04:02.049> the<00:04:02.409> loop<00:04:02.590> and<00:04:04.110> then<00:04:05.110> I<00:04:05.409> am

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
this part of the loop and then I am

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.280 
this part of the loop and then I am
going<00:04:06.040> to<00:04:06.810> actually<00:04:07.810> I<00:04:07.870> think<00:04:08.049> I'll<00:04:08.140> probably

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
going to actually I think I'll probably

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.680 
going to actually I think I'll probably
isolate<00:04:09.069> that<00:04:09.250> and<00:04:09.819> see<00:04:10.030> if<00:04:10.120> I<00:04:10.239> can<00:04:10.390> just<00:04:10.540> get

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
isolate that and see if I can just get

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.809 
isolate that and see if I can just get
no<00:04:10.930> bubbles<00:04:11.319> going<00:04:11.560> cuz<00:04:12.159> I'm<00:04:12.250> pretty<00:04:12.519> sure<00:04:12.790> I

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
no bubbles going cuz I'm pretty sure I

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.809 
no bubbles going cuz I'm pretty sure I
can<00:04:12.909> and<00:04:13.420> then<00:04:14.140> if<00:04:14.379> that<00:04:14.709> works<00:04:15.190> and<00:04:15.579> I<00:04:15.640> can

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
can and then if that works and I can

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.729 
can and then if that works and I can
keep<00:04:16.000> the<00:04:16.180> water<00:04:16.329> level<00:04:16.479> about<00:04:19.500> wherever<00:04:20.500> it

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
keep the water level about wherever it

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.180 
keep the water level about wherever it
could<00:04:20.919> be<00:04:21.270> safely<00:04:22.270> without<00:04:22.419> a<00:04:22.630> vortex<00:04:23.289> coming

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
could be safely without a vortex coming

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.790 
could be safely without a vortex coming
down<00:04:24.490> sucking<00:04:25.060> air<00:04:25.210> into<00:04:25.720> there<00:04:25.900> so<00:04:26.560> I'll<00:04:26.650> get

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
down sucking air into there so I'll get

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.480 
down sucking air into there so I'll get
that<00:04:26.979> all<00:04:27.340> tuned<00:04:27.820> in<00:04:28.030> and<00:04:28.860> then<00:04:29.860> I<00:04:30.070> will<00:04:30.280> build

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
that all tuned in and then I will build

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.960 
that all tuned in and then I will build
my<00:04:30.610> emergency<00:04:32.039> up<00:04:33.039> here<00:04:33.310> I'll<00:04:33.490> drill<00:04:33.729> another

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
my emergency up here I'll drill another

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.520 
my emergency up here I'll drill another
hole<00:04:34.090> really<00:04:34.660> didn't<00:04:34.900> think<00:04:34.930> I<00:04:35.080> need<00:04:35.289> to<00:04:35.410> do

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
hole really didn't think I need to do

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.279 
hole really didn't think I need to do
that<00:04:35.740> but<00:04:36.039> that's<00:04:36.880> cool<00:04:37.240> wasn't<00:04:37.840> factoring

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
that but that's cool wasn't factoring

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.770 
that but that's cool wasn't factoring
one<00:04:39.130> of<00:04:39.250> the<00:04:39.310> air<00:04:39.460> pressures<00:04:39.940> in<00:04:40.120> or<00:04:40.330> something

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
one of the air pressures in or something

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.379 
one of the air pressures in or something
so<00:04:41.620> so<00:04:42.340> I'll<00:04:42.490> basically<00:04:42.760> have<00:04:43.150> two

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
so so I'll basically have two

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.600 
so so I'll basically have two
independent<00:04:43.750> systems<00:04:44.440> that<00:04:44.919> are<00:04:45.070> not<00:04:45.100> talking

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
independent systems that are not talking

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.879 
independent systems that are not talking
to<00:04:45.760> each<00:04:45.850> other<00:04:46.030> no<00:04:46.720> pressures<00:04:47.139> involved<00:04:47.740> and

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
to each other no pressures involved and

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.909 
to each other no pressures involved and
I<00:04:48.699> think<00:04:49.210> we'll<00:04:49.330> be<00:04:49.449> good<00:04:49.600> the<00:04:50.530> protein

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
I think we'll be good the protein

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.969 
I think we'll be good the protein
skimmer<00:04:51.070> over<00:04:51.490> here<00:04:52.560> it's<00:04:53.560> actually<00:04:53.680> not

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
skimmer over here it's actually not

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:55.740 
skimmer over here it's actually not
running<00:04:54.310> right<00:04:54.370> now<00:04:54.639> well<00:04:54.880> it's<00:04:55.030> kind<00:04:55.660> of

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
running right now well it's kind of

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.629 
running right now well it's kind of
running<00:04:55.990> does<00:04:56.560> that<00:04:56.740> line<00:04:56.889> shoots<00:04:57.220> bubbles

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
running does that line shoots bubbles

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.140 
running does that line shoots bubbles
but<00:04:57.970> instead<00:04:58.690> of<00:04:58.810> just<00:04:58.960> coming<00:04:59.139> out<00:04:59.380> and<00:04:59.650> down

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
but instead of just coming out and down

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.180 
but instead of just coming out and down
and<00:05:01.150> then<00:05:02.139> dropping<00:05:02.380> into<00:05:02.650> the<00:05:02.710> water<00:05:02.800> which

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
and then dropping into the water which

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.770 
and then dropping into the water which
created<00:05:03.520> a<00:05:03.550> lot<00:05:03.580> of<00:05:03.760> bolts<00:05:03.910> I<00:05:04.150> just<00:05:04.599> did<00:05:04.750> a

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
created a lot of bolts I just did a

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:12.570 
created a lot of bolts I just did a
little<00:05:05.050> tube<00:05:05.229> there<00:05:05.590> and<00:05:06.460> it<00:05:06.910> goes<00:05:07.090> down<00:05:11.580> let

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
little tube there and it goes down let

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.330 
little tube there and it goes down let
me<00:05:12.729> move<00:05:12.910> it<00:05:13.620> so<00:05:14.620> it's<00:05:14.800> going<00:05:14.979> down<00:05:15.160> there

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
me move it so it's going down there

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.129 
me move it so it's going down there
problem<00:05:16.270> is<00:05:18.060> there<00:05:19.060> are<00:05:19.210> still<00:05:19.539> some<00:05:19.810> tiny

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
problem is there are still some tiny

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.760 
problem is there are still some tiny
bubbles<00:05:20.680> coming<00:05:21.280> out<00:05:21.370> of<00:05:21.550> there<00:05:22.590> you<00:05:23.590> might

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
bubbles coming out of there you might

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.040 
bubbles coming out of there you might
not<00:05:23.949> be<00:05:24.039> able<00:05:24.160> to<00:05:24.250> see<00:05:24.460> him<00:05:24.580> but<00:05:24.729> that<00:05:25.090> there<00:05:25.449> no

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
not be able to see him but that there no

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.050 
not be able to see him but that there no
there's<00:05:26.320> you<00:05:26.620> can<00:05:26.770> see<00:05:26.919> him<00:05:27.010> there's<00:05:27.820> still

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
there's you can see him there's still

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
there's you can see him there's still
bubbles<00:05:28.470> but<00:05:29.470> it's<00:05:29.620> much<00:05:29.889> better<00:05:30.479> so<00:05:31.479> what<00:05:32.050> I

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
bubbles but it's much better so what I

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.180 
bubbles but it's much better so what I
might<00:05:32.440> do<00:05:32.830> with<00:05:32.860> that<00:05:33.370> is<00:05:33.699> just<00:05:34.949> run<00:05:35.949> the

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
might do with that is just run the

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.610 
might do with that is just run the
output<00:05:36.460> of<00:05:36.789> that<00:05:38.070> over<00:05:39.070> here<00:05:39.460> near<00:05:39.789> this<00:05:39.970> guy

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
output of that over here near this guy

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.360 
output of that over here near this guy
and<00:05:41.760> then<00:05:42.760> build<00:05:43.000> a<00:05:43.060> bubble<00:05:43.330> trap<00:05:43.570> here

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
and then build a bubble trap here

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.770 
and then build a bubble trap here
because<00:05:45.370> I'm<00:05:45.490> gonna<00:05:45.639> have<00:05:45.789> a<00:05:45.820> fusion<00:05:46.240> here<00:05:46.630> at

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
because I'm gonna have a fusion here at

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.350 
because I'm gonna have a fusion here at
some<00:05:47.080> point<00:05:47.349> anyway<00:05:47.610> so<00:05:48.610> that's<00:05:48.970> what<00:05:49.210> we'll

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
some point anyway so that's what we'll

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.339 
some point anyway so that's what we'll
try<00:05:49.539> tomorrow<00:05:49.900> I<00:05:51.900> really<00:05:52.900> thought<00:05:53.050> my<00:05:53.110> idea

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:53.349 
try tomorrow I really thought my idea

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:56.240 
try tomorrow I really thought my idea
would<00:05:53.680> work<00:05:53.710> but<00:05:54.250> looking<00:05:55.000> at<00:05:55.120> it<00:05:55.240> right<00:05:55.389> now

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
would work but looking at it right now

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.180 
would work but looking at it right now
I'm<00:05:57.250> starting<00:05:57.610> to<00:05:57.760> understand<00:05:58.620> why<00:05:59.620> it<00:05:59.680> didn't

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190 
I'm starting to understand why it didn't

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.350 
I'm starting to understand why it didn't
work

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
work

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.970 
work
for<00:06:01.990> some<00:06:02.140> of<00:06:02.230> these<00:06:02.290> projects<00:06:02.740> that<00:06:02.890> would

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:02.980 
for some of these projects that would

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.880 
for some of these projects that would
sure<00:06:03.220> help<00:06:03.250> to<00:06:03.790> have<00:06:04.000> clear<00:06:04.930> PVC<00:06:05.170> which<00:06:05.680> I<00:06:05.830> know

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:05.890 
sure help to have clear PVC which I know

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.240 
sure help to have clear PVC which I know
is<00:06:06.220> available<00:06:07.080> it's<00:06:08.080> just<00:06:08.350> so<00:06:08.530> expensive<00:06:08.890> when

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
is available it's just so expensive when

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.430 
is available it's just so expensive when
you<00:06:09.280> make<00:06:09.490> mistakes<00:06:09.910> like<00:06:10.090> this<00:06:10.360> it'll<00:06:11.230> cost

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 
you make mistakes like this it'll cost

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.710 
you make mistakes like this it'll cost
you<00:06:11.770> and<00:06:12.040> I'm<00:06:12.460> just<00:06:12.730> not<00:06:12.940> I'm<00:06:13.300> not<00:06:13.480> at<00:06:13.630> that

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
you and I'm just not I'm not at that

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.810 
you and I'm just not I'm not at that
level<00:06:13.780> if<00:06:14.140> I'm<00:06:14.290> really<00:06:14.800> to<00:06:15.370> a<00:06:15.400> point<00:06:15.640> where

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820 
level if I'm really to a point where

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.210 
level if I'm really to a point where
like<00:06:16.030> I<00:06:16.270> don't<00:06:16.650> understand<00:06:17.650> why<00:06:17.830> this<00:06:17.890> is

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
like I don't understand why this is

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.130 
like I don't understand why this is
doing<00:06:18.520> this<00:06:18.670> then<00:06:18.970> I'll<00:06:19.120> do<00:06:19.300> the<00:06:19.420> PVC<00:06:19.870> the

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.140 
doing this then I'll do the PVC the

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.010 
doing this then I'll do the PVC the
clear<00:06:20.380> PVC<00:06:20.560> but<00:06:21.100> right<00:06:21.760> now<00:06:22.000> I<00:06:22.330> will<00:06:22.990> just

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
clear PVC but right now I will just

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.500 
clear PVC but right now I will just
stick<00:06:23.380> with<00:06:23.530> this<00:06:23.770> and<00:06:24.010> I<00:06:24.100> will<00:06:24.360> continue<00:06:25.360> to

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.510 
stick with this and I will continue to

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.790 
stick with this and I will continue to
learn<00:06:25.750> so<00:06:26.590> we'll<00:06:27.070> see<00:06:27.430> you<00:06:27.460> tomorrow
