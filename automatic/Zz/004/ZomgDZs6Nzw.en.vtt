00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.039 
again it opened the second free pack the
wish<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.549> should<00:01:29.790> be<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.119> last<00:01:30.270> repack<00:01:30.869> we

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
wish that should be the last repack we

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.800 
wish that should be the last repack we
get<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.710> saw<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.070> there<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.630> yeah<00:01:33.630> we've

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
get you saw it there and yeah we've
