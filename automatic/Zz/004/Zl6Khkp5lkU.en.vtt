00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:37.579

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.140
 but who rafaela rodrigues on her side 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.670
 there is not even the arm in front 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.559
 fight we wait between the streaks 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.020

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.719
 federal district and in the five rafaela 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.399
 swimmer of the paraná and the perhaps is the capital

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.180
 meters and rafaela will be in 1º arraiá 5 and 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.840
 in second place the dolphin featherweight 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.840
 from argentina 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.830
 rafaela is already starting to put a 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.830
 advantage over opponents 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:19.280
 in a green swimsuit you see the colors of the 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.280
 flag white panama green and blue 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.399
 now the dolphin in front of Argentina in 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:29.909
 streak 6 at the end will have ice with the surprise 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.799
 135 1 against 1 391 of the raem coming 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.690
 only at this moment is Argentina going to 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.580
 now she starts to move 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.039
 the other Brazilian are also actually 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.140
 are at the margin of cnaa 4 began to 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:45.630
 grow as aaa the favela but is less 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:49.950
 five is already trying to put more 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:53.270
 distance in argentina tries to grow 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.700
 also in the test the most of the full baraka 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.100
 but still in front of the paulista gives 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.979
 in fact the district swimmer 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.860
 federal rafael ricci on streak two in 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.300
 in front of them argentina delfina pilatti 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.489
 link 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.799
 pay attention mainly at the turn 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.500
 now when rafaela saw the time she 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.050
 is underwater 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.420
 now is to know if the turn of the 200 meters 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.400
 that is to say half as much evidence as 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.500
 three are already aligned 3 must turn 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.970
 together and this moment until one passes a 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.800
 little ahead is still Argentine rafael 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.450
 pay attention and the one that goes in the middle 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.280
 rafael the time that she is under the 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.290
 water there she goes out there in front of her 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.000
 really takes a lot of use and turned 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.550
 in front is the senator from the 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.500
 paraná 2 11 9 partial part of the Brazilian 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:42.650
 in the hard 45 exactly the favorite of the 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.430
 parana in front of 200 meters 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.140
 The fight is very interesting to Argentina. 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.430
 at the end of the sentence she begins to become 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.980
 bit backwards who enters the 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.120
 Proof is also lower and baraka 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.980
 stroke stroke 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.150
 the two are competing for meters within 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:03.310
 pool of the sports association 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:05.330
 mocoquense the turn of the 250 still 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.780
 rafaela rodrigues at the front for only 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.780
 two tenths 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.080
 the idea is the difference kaká rafaela time 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.360
 on the turn is very big she can 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.340
 stay a long time in the race below 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.840
 water and oil makes a difference is 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.130
 this one we'll see now if the turn 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.930
 two 300 meters 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.490
 and hey, I've grown up on the sidelines and 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.170
 argentina stayed behind 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.030
 In other words, the dispute is now between 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.410
 4 and 5 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.070
 will turn on the front of the 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.540
 apparently comes first hits no 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.970
 still 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.620
 rafaela rodrigues at the end for three 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.760
 tenths was able to stay ahead in this 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.740
 turning 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.280
 there are less than one hundred meters to the end 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.280
 of the test 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.060
 It's shameful the picket in the 200 meters 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.490
 just it is no more the cable screen 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.020
 there will be dispute returned to be real 45 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.220
 at this moment a little bit of advantage 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.750
 to rafaela 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.060
 Look how the girls have already implemented 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.980
 alternately you see that they just know 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.740
 high in the water is exactly one end of 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.520
 proves the last turn 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:11.820
 we see that seen in front took the 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.790
 rafaela amalric already opening a little bit 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:19.470
 four tenths in relation to the march 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:21.690
 Missing baraka is about 30 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.200
 meters to the end of the test zon arrived 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:28.200
 in the middle of the pool and goes away 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.290
 rafaela amalric a perfect proof 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.690
 tactically leaving the paranaense with 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:37.260
 enough advantage over the swimmer of the 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:42.840
 federal district but found baraka well already 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:44.640
 for eu to win with four 2351 is 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:49.490
 record is record 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:53.310
 broke the record since 2004 was 4 23 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:57.419
 92 sensational sensational result to 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.740
 proof of rafaela áurich do paraná won 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.740
 the first test of the swimming pool trophy 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.790
 is the new record holder of the hit competition 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.950
 the red hot 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.950
 the African national record lasted 10
