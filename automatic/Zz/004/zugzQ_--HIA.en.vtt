in<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.260> 20s<00:00:28.680> around<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.980> Prohibition<00:00:29.640> era

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
in the 20s around the Prohibition era

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.900 
in the 20s around the Prohibition era

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
and it was a prison off the mainland and

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.569 
and it was a prison off the mainland and
was<00:00:33.780> basically<00:00:34.620> for<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.920> worst<00:00:35.100> prisoners

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
was basically for the worst prisoners

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.580 
was basically for the worst prisoners
because<00:00:35.910> it's<00:00:36.390> very<00:00:36.750> hard<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.050> escape<00:00:37.260> because

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
because it's very hard to escape because

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.860 
because it's very hard to escape because
you're<00:00:37.980> off<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.730> mainland<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.600> had<00:00:39.750> to

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
you're off the mainland and you had to

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.200 
you're off the mainland and you had to
swim<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.410> shore<00:00:40.710> which<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.820> basically

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
swim to shore which is basically

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.450 
swim to shore which is basically
impossible<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.840> do<00:00:43.020> i'm<00:00:43.920> not<00:00:44.100> sure<00:00:44.280> but<00:00:44.309> i
