rub<00:01:48.009> that<00:01:48.069> in<00:01:48.490> and<00:01:48.789> it's<00:01:48.969> not<00:01:49.299> as<00:01:49.539> bad<00:01:49.779> as<00:01:49.840> a

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
rub that in and it's not as bad as a

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.289 
rub that in and it's not as bad as a
gray<00:01:50.349> as<00:01:50.619> some<00:01:50.950> dry<00:01:51.189> shampoos<00:01:51.639> and<00:01:51.969> it's

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
gray as some dry shampoos and it's

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.719 
gray as some dry shampoos and it's
really<00:01:52.569> easy<00:01:52.749> to<00:01:52.869> rub<00:01:53.109> in<00:01:53.289> so<00:01:54.159> I<00:01:54.189> don't<00:01:54.579> think

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
really easy to rub in so I don't think

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.669 
really easy to rub in so I don't think
that's<00:01:54.880> bad<00:01:55.149> at<00:01:55.359> all<00:01:55.479> and<00:01:55.899> it<00:01:55.990> completely

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
that's bad at all and it completely

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:59.159 
that's bad at all and it completely
takes<00:01:56.889> away<00:01:57.369> any<00:01:57.579> grease<00:01:58.119> hope<00:01:58.630> you<00:01:58.749> guys<00:01:58.899> can

my head I'll do right there
guys<00:02:09.130> see<00:02:09.399> I<00:02:09.430> have<00:02:09.790> some<00:02:10.090> not<00:02:10.300> gray<00:02:10.690> roots<00:02:11.520> but

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
guys see I have some not gray roots but

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.760 
guys see I have some not gray roots but
just<00:02:13.210> rub<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.450> in<00:02:13.630> and<00:02:14.020> it<00:02:14.200> totally<00:02:14.530> goes<00:02:14.890> away

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
just rub it in and it totally goes away

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.640 
just rub it in and it totally goes away
and<00:02:17.770> then<00:02:18.550> also<00:02:18.820> you<00:02:19.060> can<00:02:19.510> brush<00:02:20.170> it<00:02:20.230> out<00:02:20.500> with

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
and then also you can brush it out with

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.950 
and then also you can brush it out with
a<00:02:20.680> brush<00:02:21.010> but<00:02:21.280> i<00:02:21.400> think<00:02:21.640> that<00:02:21.700> rubbing<00:02:22.270> does<00:02:22.930> a

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
a brush but i think that rubbing does a

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.190 
a brush but i think that rubbing does a
fine<00:02:23.320> job<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:23.920> so<00:02:24.550> this<00:02:24.910> does<00:02:25.450> give<00:02:25.780> your<00:02:25.960> hair

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
fine job and so this does give your hair

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.110 
fine job and so this does give your hair
a<00:02:26.230> lot<00:02:26.590> more<00:02:26.800> body<00:02:27.160> and<00:02:27.520> volume<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:29.550> it<00:02:30.550> just

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
a lot more body and volume and it just

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.580 
a lot more body and volume and it just
like<00:02:31.300> it<00:02:31.330> looks<00:02:31.720> like<00:02:31.930> i<00:02:32.020> just<00:02:32.230> washed<00:02:32.350> my<00:02:32.500> hair

and true brit one because we all keep
british<00:03:04.450> but<00:03:05.080> most<00:03:05.470> importantly<00:03:06.070> is<00:03:06.400> that<00:03:06.670> it

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
british but most importantly is that it

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.310 
british but most importantly is that it
doesn't<00:03:07.209> have<00:03:07.300> a<00:03:07.330> strong<00:03:07.630> smell<00:03:07.870> it<00:03:08.140> works

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.020 
doesn't have a strong smell it works
really<00:03:08.500> well<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:09.100> it<00:03:09.310> doesn't<00:03:09.610> it's<00:03:09.970> not

really well and it doesn't it's not

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.530 
really well and it doesn't it's not
promising<00:03:10.840> anything<00:03:11.310> that<00:03:12.310> it<00:03:12.430> does<00:03:12.550> do<00:03:12.910> like

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
promising anything that it does do like

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.940 
promising anything that it does do like
the<00:03:13.690> black<00:03:13.900> one<00:03:13.930> even<00:03:14.470> though<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.650> black<00:03:14.800> one

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
the black one even though the black one

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.890 
the black one even though the black one
was<00:03:15.070> awesome<00:03:15.519> and<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:16.269> works<00:03:16.450> really<00:03:16.750> well

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
was awesome and it works really well

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.750 
was awesome and it works really well
this<00:03:17.380> one<00:03:17.650> i<00:03:17.860> think<00:03:18.070> just<00:03:18.250> works<00:03:18.400> a<00:03:18.489> little<00:03:18.580> bit

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
this one i think just works a little bit

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.960 
this one i think just works a little bit
better<00:03:18.880> has<00:03:19.660> a<00:03:19.690> better<00:03:19.900> smell<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:20.500> such<00:03:20.970> okay

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
better has a better smell and such okay
