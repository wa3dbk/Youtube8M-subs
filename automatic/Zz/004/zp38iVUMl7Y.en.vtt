just<00:02:49.450> by<00:02:49.630> pre<00:02:49.810> taping<00:02:50.169> material<00:02:50.650> I<00:02:51.000> think<00:02:52.000> it

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
just by pre taping material I think it

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.520 
just by pre taping material I think it
should<00:02:52.239> be<00:02:52.419> and<00:02:52.690> I<00:02:52.870> think<00:02:52.900> it's<00:02:53.230> going<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.410> come

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
should be and I think it's going to come

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.129 
should be and I think it's going to come
to<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:53.709> point<00:02:53.919> where<00:02:54.069> like<00:02:54.519> the<00:02:55.150> store<00:02:55.450> power<00:02:55.720> is

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139 
to a point where like the store power is

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:58.290 
to a point where like the store power is
getting<00:02:56.470> smaller<00:02:56.620> and<00:02:56.980> smaller<00:02:57.069> and<00:02:57.459> you<00:02:58.030> know

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
getting smaller and smaller and you know

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.130 
getting smaller and smaller and you know
they're<00:02:58.450> going<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.630> have<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:58.780> create<00:02:59.020> new

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
they're going to have to create new

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.780 
they're going to have to create new
