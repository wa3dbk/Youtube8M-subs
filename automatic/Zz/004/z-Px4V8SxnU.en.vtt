00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.430
 hello to everyone alexander djibo forum 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.830
 francophone then rather of the day 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.550
 turn on and off anti bots 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.040
 via windows under windows environment 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.270
 with a small application at the end of 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.910
 account a small order that is very 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.380
 very convenient called nir cmd to 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.560
 which we add what's called a 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.440
 argument that achieves a 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.820
 specific action then point out dose 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.890
 so we can clan and the tasks we 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.559
 can create a task and schedule it 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.910
 only thing is that we ask a 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.770
 account and an administrator password 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.960
 to plan the task 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.190
 so what are we going to do in a 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.380
 first time is that we will disable 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.880
 this option by going to the base 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.330
 of registry so watch out in the base 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.220
 register 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.320
 Of course, you do not have to do anything 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.700
 what since it's a bit of the core of 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.010
 system if we are not a problem 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.390
 change keys without knowing we're going 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.220
 obviously disturb the environment 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.040
 windows 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.869
 so let's go to reissue 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.240
 so windows seven search bar 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.560
 see you at peri says windows xp 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.380
 executed reggae says 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.320
 and so we get to the core a moment 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.400
 there as we define it so I have my 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.050
 little girl still worries with me 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.159
 today and still makes noise 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.260
 so I hope she does not go too much 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.640
 disturb but it's a baby of which against 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.140
 not obviously so I leave it 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.760
 free of his acts 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.850
 so once you're in reggae 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.049
 said you go in hkey local machine 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.570
 control system 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.490
 curan to control this forgiveness control 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.430
 and wanted while up files 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.900
 and the breasts on the right is not displayed 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.570
 the excesses in the end 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.270
 and then we will stop on blank limit 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.470
 password use or modify it and on the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.610
 decimal exact value you type 0 ok 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.060
 so we close that and we have now 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.790
 simply released 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.409
 returning and a password to 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.329
 every time now we will have more so 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:04.189
 this hotel asked me by windows 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:05.899
 so next we'll download there the 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.179
 small applications that you will have your 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.560
 browser is called google in the 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.760
 google search bar you type 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.880
 hold these m17 the returned issue to the links 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.530
 nir soft point net so you click on 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.620
 go down the bottom of the home page 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.269
 of the site and click on download or rct 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.700
 then led once there was 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.530
 downloaded en masse went away without 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.540
 on purpose he must have 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.110
 downloaded so there form under 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.840
 zip format 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:37.790
 we will just hesitate to unzip 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:40.819
 archives so pack so I'm going for less 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:45.230
 open the downloads folder copy 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:47.090
 ultimately the total on record 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.120
 my office and I'm going to extract from 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.590
 from here are the files so you'll have 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.720
 two applications inside coming 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.720
 cld and so we whoever 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.600
 interested and nir cnb ok there is nice nir 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.049
 cmt it's no we're not going to come cmd you 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.209
 copy or copÃ© you cut forgiveness 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.670
 and we will milk them directly to the 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.739
 root of these two points tac 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.590
 go I stick so me there is already 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.600
 necessarily I replace a whole 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.650
 simply 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.780
 the important thing is that he is here 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.980
 just make sure that the will of school property 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.109
 so we can close this page 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.209
 now and we will go to the 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.519
 windows task scheduler for 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:29.180
 start the tasks while the 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.829
 planner then seven vista you 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.400
 type planner does not have any 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:36.500
 search and you have it in windows xp 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.569
 of memory all programs 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.560
 accessories or ten system tools 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.150
 task scheduler 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.590
 if you ever do not find a small 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.690
 Google search invites easily 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.139
 find so we will create a task 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.239
 just create a task so is 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:53.180
 will call him me I will call him your 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.989
 monitor then offers the little starts 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.760
 to make some noise 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:04:00.500
 I will see what she asks me so 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.629
 monitor offers since the first task 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.140
 will consist of turning off the screen so 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:08.269
 in the trigger we will configure in 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.400
 ultimately the qualification 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.560
 so I want it to be every 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.290
 week I want it to be on monday the 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.049
 Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.840
 on Saturday for example and then as we 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.599
 turn it off game paint them at night you 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.090
 see my sweetheart you're pretty then tac 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:27.950
 so there ok I planned my task so 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.210
 you will see his sweetheart under xp that's 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.890
 not necessarily the same is a little bit 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.820
 different but if you are looking for yourself 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.430
 will find exactly the same 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.090
 functions 1 so in action but one 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:40.360
 will fetch 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:44.180
 nir cmd simply so I go 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:47.120
 I go to the root of these the point tac 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.830
 I go down to get my cmd he's there and 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.010
 so I'm going to add the argument here 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.360
 monitor to respect this well 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.320
 writing otherwise it will not work 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:00.710
 not molitor off off that takes 2 f and I 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:03.050
 click on ok so the trigger 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.580
 it is created every week of Monday 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.390
 Friday to Saturday forgiveness 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.250
 and then it was activated at 8 pm 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.990
 the action is the start of 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.310
 the application with like a carrot 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.050
 for ignition 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.669
 although you are doing exactly the same 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.820
 thing except that you type here mollicone 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.870
 and you change of course the timing is 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.700
 to say that if you want it started at 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.080
 8am starting at 10am this morning at 9am 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.729
 hours 9 hours to his parents when he 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.919
 there are conditions there are parameters 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:29.180
 I did not necessarily need to 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.919
 touch for now if you want 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.129
 look a little bit at what's going on but I 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.319
 leave you yourself 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:35.520
 discover a little bit this windows that 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:38.729
 bring you in terms of configuration 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.409
 in any case as it is there we should 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:41.239
 to be able to work then we will test 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:44.699
 the task now 

00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:47.159
 now that she is made so tac I 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:49.199
 returns library of tasks I 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:52.649
 go down to get my job from the monitor of 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:55.409
 right-click ejected tac - the screen is a 

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:56.639
 well that means his section then 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:58.800
 maybe on the record it does not 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:00.119
 will not be seen anyway there such as 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.740
 it's the computer is off 

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:06.629
 I touch the screen to reactivate the 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.119
 reactivate the rock monitor display so 

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:10.499
 we are almost flats likewise the 

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:13.709
 same procedure is a function of arguments 

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:15.449
 molitor ok so here with tea it's 

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:17.429
