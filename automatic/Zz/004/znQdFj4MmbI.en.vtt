00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.230
 [music] 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.700
 I greet you, dear connoisseurs 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.570
 chamotte with you in touch 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.330
 master fit maxim crashes and we start 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:23.550
 Another blitz so but I have a comp 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:28.199
 for the worst so most likely not 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:34.440
 will cut down the flag will play quickly so much 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:35.120
 rival make a move already Olga trout horse 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.000
 f3 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.219
 let's go out of the wand 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.070
 to order 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:48.809
 let's swap option spanish party 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:50.960
 who loved since phisher himself that 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.760
 you i loved him 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.550
 at one time he played his classics as 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.940
 basic option 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.150
 now without blitz on now about mountains 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.150
 pathfinder 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:11.170
 every break wanted to collect at 4 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:17.920
 competently 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:20.970
 let it break river up to 2 scraps 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.970
 no advertising on 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:30.690
 so what to do now somehow the same realms of sleep 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.690
 3 costs a little awkwardly in the end 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:41.940
 or in 4 to carry out the plan or let's without and 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.940
 bream 34 I will spend 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.840
 but if so then I will knight on and 4 will introduce 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.680
 just a rook on e1 will now lead 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.229
 such a game 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.530
 Firs seems our 2 is no longer needed here 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.180
 Now we will put it back on the same 3 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.990
 because here is the wording in 4 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:05.259
 hold already makes no sense 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:09.459
 as the e5 pawn is an isolated weak 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:13.740
 let it be so and that school g3 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:18.430
 You can play of course the table that 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.260
 let's see where he goes on the water and all 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:29.740
 the course is a normal adjusted elephant 5 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:31.510
 will be owning the whole but i am back so needed 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.400
 three don't want to play already three all the same 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.800
 it makes sense that you knock out this horse 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.160
 6 let's play firmly on the 2 then 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.160
 translate 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.640
 horse e6 now does not get on 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.129
 good fields horse up to 2 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.900
 displacing frets from here to me 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:55.860
 annoying queen put on a wand attacking 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.860
 on the b7 pawn to the next move like this 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:09.629
 forced c6 easing now play me 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.629
 rings 40 and begin the siege of the e5 pawn 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:19.840
 walk 5 years can bring but not yet 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:24.549
 I see how fine when you play the elephant to 23 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:31.870
 translation is now I can double 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:35.319
 just owning 2 or even lanites on his 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:38.459
 not hanging so far the truth will be later 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.459
 I came out to hang barely 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:53.970
 to e3 we are still not afraid of the end of 4 horse right now 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:58.109
 on waited steel forcing out puts here 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.109
 here and not welcome 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:09.000
 but they even asked me to leave once 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:09.000
 insist big on 630 horse h2 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:21.329
 so where does the next move take the sun 3 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.329
 I do not know whether it makes sense to erase h4 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.460
 not to let h4 collect black but 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:31.889
 number 5 then your 4 like that 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:35.249
 revision next move 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:45.259
 I'm all alone then ran out f1 goes to 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:48.569
 people or even through f3 already through f3 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:51.870
 now elephants back see d2 because 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:54.539
 caress dancing itching with dancing with the stars 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:58.020
 it turns out such a maneuverable game so on 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:05:01.650
 pawn 2 on the field and and we give not at all 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:06.500
 bound to edges b3 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:09.029
 or a3 and a4 you want to play under your age 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.909
 underbrush strong move bo3 ira and time 

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:16.199
 no 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:22.349
 for 42 follow the principle of nothing 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:27.439
 scary so here that he conceived it 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:27.439
 pawn can not be beat because after 5-6 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:36.689
 some who will be left without a villain on foot 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.879
 passes after dc shorter win 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:41.460
 on foot and friends pawn can not be beat because 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:48.860

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:50.300
 ella uncle for 6 rating is not really bad 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.770
 99 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.139
 it is necessary to correct well in short all the move 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:58.529
 nonsense to ash complete now all glorious 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:05.159
