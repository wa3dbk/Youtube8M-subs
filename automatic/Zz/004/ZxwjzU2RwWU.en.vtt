 fashion photographer

 first it's a son of photographers 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.320
 so that's important his father was 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.789
 a very great photographer who was a 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.649
 star in the seventies who has 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.300
 had a very big influence on 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.680

 shehem who associated with jimmy choo and 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.049
 it was he who was chosen to fill 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.490
 the 2010 pirelli calendar of bombs 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.380

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.390
 the months visibly the shoot was 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.590
 wild proof in pictures 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.590
 [Music] 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.720
 so we went to london to 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.280
 the launch of the story calendar of 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.840

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.130
 from daisy love to miranda kerr by the way 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.390
 by the top lily school that flashes on everything 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.670
 which moves even in broad daylight 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.750
 who was this gentleman who wagne dedication 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.340
 to all those men in tuxedos 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.210
 weird phrases he made king 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.350
 so we went to ask him if 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.479
 he was the best photographer 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.360
 in the world as some say then 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.189

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.640

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.750
 best samba hockey in any case he 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.100
 just ask people who 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.569
 work with him to understand that 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.710
 it's a photographer jean titteri his 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:08.840
 assistant is thrilled 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.890
 it's almost heaven he's got 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.670
 luck and I'm lucky to 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.650
 work with him 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.870
 the editor of English vogue is 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.319
 crazy he enumerates beaulieu and I love 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:24.670
 eva herzigova gaga 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:26.620
 he is a top model donkament here and there 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.329
 terry it sounds like mystery but then 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.420
 what's his thing to this photographer 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:32.829
 he has in any case this shift that had 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.900
 newton in these pictures where he was 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.629
 able to play with the proportions of 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.180
 size of the people there to how to do 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.170
 pose very original mannequins 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.340
 actually there are some things that 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.810
 photographers love the 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.960
 producer of the calendar our finalists 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.450
 friendly 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.250
 and at the break of the girls who 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.830
 kiss the break challenge at four 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.180
 paws break the girl in the water there 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.120
 at a few pauses that come back all 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.650
 time yes there is also the girl who is the 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.120
 play arms crossed on jersey tighten her 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.620
 we were not going to believe that terry 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.140
 richardson vice shocked it's not at all 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.880
 that I'm not looking for the shocking or the 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.170
 too openly sexual but we want that 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.430
 people stop and look at the card 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.840
 photo go look at me yes it's good 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.520
 in fact the secret of this photographer 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.810
 so-called trash is that he was having fun 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.500
 that he is rather good-natured with his 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.300
 girlfriends models 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.100
 he is warm but he is not 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.360
 familiar interests so it's he has 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:25.100
 a lot of respect for the models 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.420
 and I think that he is in everything 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.470
 case in his human side and let's dance 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.200
 people in his behavior 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.000
 staff very far from these pictures ago 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.440
 respect in how to deal with 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.050
 people and the dummies and the baule and 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.660
 photographed in dot that passes on 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.070
 a table there is no discomfort there 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.450
 not a moment where you say where it 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.770
 flip into something that I put the 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.060
 people uncomfortable or who throws first 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.880
 he forces nobody to do the photos that 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.560
 done and yes every break every photo 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.420
 what did you do for yourself? 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.710
 he does not have if we wanted to wear 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.680
 clothes or bras on 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.060
 could he have not asked for anything 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.230
 and then the advantage with terry richardson 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.810
 it's that he has ideas that do not cost 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.940
 cheap to produce 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.770
 40a on our calendars pictures of 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.600
 Catherine McNeil with milk on her 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:12.950
 chest is actually the choice of a 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:14.780
 camshaft% natural I was free 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.230
 a gift from the rubber trees of the 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.120
 latex is not a spendthrift photographer 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:24.320
 he takes and is inspired by what he 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.670
 or everything is a game for him so here is 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.440
 a photographer who does not take himself for 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.920
 a star but whose goal is to 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.590
 photograph still full of water 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.820
 example brad pitt I always wanted the 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.510
 to photograph but I 'm never going 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.620
 photographed who else madonna I 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.420
 always wanted her to pose for me 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.620
 but it's still to be done I still have 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.690
 a lot of people to photograph well 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.240
 sure carla burnished but also johnny 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:51.060
 hallyday johnny hallyday formidable bond 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:53.160
