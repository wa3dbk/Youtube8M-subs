these elements in the background I

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.650 
these elements in the background I
should<00:00:29.340> also<00:00:29.490> point<00:00:29.609> out<00:00:29.970> with<00:00:30.179> all<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.539> these

layers<00:00:33.180> turned<00:00:33.630> on<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:34.559> way<00:00:34.739> we<00:00:34.890> can<00:00:34.920> do<00:00:35.219> this

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
layers turned on that way we can do this

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.670

retouching<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.270> separate<00:00:36.719> layer<00:00:36.930> now

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
retouching to a separate layer now

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.560 
retouching to a separate layer now
because<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.100> background<00:00:38.550> out<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.790> focus<00:00:38.940> this

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
because the background out of focus this

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.690 
because the background out of focus this
isn't<00:00:39.960> essential<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.800> do<00:00:40.920> these<00:00:41.100> little

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
isn't essential to do these little

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.880

retouch<00:00:42.030> work<00:00:42.270> here<00:00:42.600> but<00:00:43.140> nonetheless<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.710> just

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
retouch work here but nonetheless I just

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.680 
retouch work here but nonetheless I just
want<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.100> reduce<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.640> simplify<00:00:44.670> as<00:00:45.270> much<00:00:45.510> as

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
possible because we know that the eye

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.690 
possible because we know that the eye
goes<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.450> areas<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:48.899> brightness<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.890> also

intent<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> image<00:01:43.079> now<00:01:43.860> one<00:01:44.009> thing<00:01:44.040> I

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
intent of the image now one thing I

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.100 
intent of the image now one thing I
should<00:01:44.369> point<00:01:44.579> out<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.210> because<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:46.079> a

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
should point out that because this is a

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.620 
should point out that because this is a
guy<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.770> because<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.579> person<00:01:48.329> who<00:01:48.479> is

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
guy and because this is a person who is

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.719 
guy and because this is a person who is
an<00:01:48.780> athlete<00:01:49.229> we<00:01:49.860> don't<00:01:49.950> want<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.220> soften<00:01:50.430> this

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
an athlete we don't want to soften this

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.060 
an athlete we don't want to soften this
up<00:01:50.939> too<00:01:51.270> much<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:52.290> want<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.560> leave<00:01:52.770> some

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
up too much you want to leave some

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.590 
up too much you want to leave some
blemishes<00:01:53.310> here<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.060> want<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.329> make<00:01:54.450> the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
blemishes here you want to make the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.660 
blemishes here you want to make the
person<00:01:54.810> seemed<00:01:55.619> real<00:01:55.920> because<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.399> lot<00:01:56.640> of

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
person seemed real because a lot of

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.480 
person seemed real because a lot of
times<00:01:57.020> athletes<00:01:58.020> have<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.740> edge<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.369> them

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
times athletes have that edge to them

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.520 
times athletes have that edge to them
and<00:01:59.759> we<00:01:59.850> don't<00:01:59.939> want<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.210> soften<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.869> so

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
and we don't want to soften that so

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.920 
and we don't want to soften that so
again<00:02:01.799> as<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.310> reduce<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.880> simplify<00:02:02.930> i'm

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
again as I reduce and simplify i'm

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.560 
again as I reduce and simplify i'm
looking<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.439> create<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.920> stylized<00:02:05.570> perspective

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
looking to create a stylized perspective

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.240 
looking to create a stylized perspective
of<00:02:06.719> this<00:02:06.930> person<00:02:07.380> but<00:02:07.860> i<00:02:07.890> don't<00:02:08.069> want<00:02:08.190> to

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
of this person but i don't want to

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.729 
of this person but i don't want to
create<00:02:08.429> something<00:02:08.520> that's<00:02:08.849> surreal<00:02:09.569> so<00:02:09.989> we'll

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
create something that's surreal so we'll

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.740 
create something that's surreal so we'll
just<00:02:10.979> look<00:02:11.190> at<00:02:11.370> how<00:02:11.520> we<00:02:11.580> can<00:02:11.760> reduce<00:02:12.420> and

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
just look at how we can reduce and

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.790 
just look at how we can reduce and
simplify<00:02:12.780> here

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
simplify here

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.800 
simplify here
as<00:02:13.860> much<00:02:14.490> as<00:02:14.670> possible<00:02:14.880> without<00:02:15.420> going

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
as much as possible without going

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.620 
as much as possible without going
overboard<00:02:17.090> whenever<00:02:18.090> you're<00:02:18.240> doing<00:02:18.510> this

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
overboard whenever you're doing this

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.360 
overboard whenever you're doing this
detail<00:02:19.080> work<00:02:19.290> it's<00:02:19.530> always<00:02:19.800> a<00:02:19.830> good<00:02:20.010> idea<00:02:20.070> to

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
detail work it's always a good idea to

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.150 
detail work it's always a good idea to
put<00:02:20.640> on<00:02:20.760> some<00:02:21.000> good<00:02:21.150> music<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.770> also<00:02:22.770> you<00:02:22.830> may

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
put on some good music and also you may

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.100 
put on some good music and also you may
be<00:02:23.220> noticing<00:02:23.820> that<00:02:23.940> as<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.390> do<00:02:24.450> this<00:02:24.900> I'm

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
be noticing that as I do this I'm

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.830 
be noticing that as I do this I'm
pressing<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.040> option<00:02:26.610> key<00:02:26.850> quite<00:02:27.330> often<00:02:27.570> a

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
pressing the option key quite often a

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.200 
pressing the option key quite often a
sample<00:02:28.320> from<00:02:28.440> different<00:02:28.890> areas<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.520> I<00:02:30.030> want

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
sample from different areas and I want

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.270 
sample from different areas and I want
to<00:02:30.300> do<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:30.540> so<00:02:30.930> that<00:02:30.960> I<00:02:31.110> don't<00:02:31.200> ever<00:02:31.620> sample

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
to do that so that I don't ever sample

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.340 
to do that so that I don't ever sample
from<00:02:32.460> the<00:02:32.610> same<00:02:32.880> area<00:02:33.180> more<00:02:33.930> than<00:02:34.080> just<00:02:34.260> a

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
from the same area more than just a

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.290 
from the same area more than just a
couple<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.830> times<00:02:35.010> because<00:02:35.790> in<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.060> real

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
couple of times because in a real

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.090 
couple of times because in a real
workflow<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:36.840> need<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.200> be<00:02:37.350> incredibly<00:02:38.070> careful

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
workflow I need to be incredibly careful

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.910 
workflow I need to be incredibly careful
that<00:02:38.760> I'm<00:02:38.880> not<00:02:39.090> repeating<00:02:39.900> any<00:02:40.200> patterns<00:02:40.710> or

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
that I'm not repeating any patterns or

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.560 
that I'm not repeating any patterns or
textures<00:02:41.490> that's<00:02:42.150> going<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.420> become

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
textures that's going to become

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.380 
textures that's going to become
noticeable<00:02:43.440> later<00:02:43.710> so<00:02:44.400> again<00:02:44.700> just<00:02:44.730> doing<00:02:45.300> a

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
noticeable later so again just doing a

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.780 
noticeable later so again just doing a
lot<00:02:45.600> of<00:02:45.660> little<00:02:45.960> teeny<00:02:46.290> work<00:02:46.620> but<00:02:47.340> trying<00:02:47.700> to

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
lot of little teeny work but trying to

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.820 
lot of little teeny work but trying to
have<00:02:47.940> my<00:02:48.090> sample<00:02:48.630> area<00:02:48.870> come<00:02:49.290> from<00:02:49.620> different

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
have my sample area come from different

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.670 
have my sample area come from different
areas<00:02:50.370> so<00:02:51.120> that<00:02:51.150> we<00:02:51.630> can<00:02:51.810> hide<00:02:52.020> this<00:02:52.260> as<00:02:52.470> much

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
areas so that we can hide this as much

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.070 
areas so that we can hide this as much
as<00:02:52.710> possible<00:02:53.270> the<00:02:54.270> trick<00:02:54.540> with<00:02:54.720> this<00:02:54.870> of

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
as possible the trick with this of

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.530 
as possible the trick with this of
course<00:02:55.110> is<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.650> right<00:02:55.980> now<00:02:56.190> we're<00:02:57.090> zoomed

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
course is that right now we're zoomed

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.290 
course is that right now we're zoomed
way<00:02:57.720> in<00:02:58.290> what<00:02:58.950> we<00:02:59.070> need<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.310> do<00:02:59.490> pretty<00:02:59.730> soon<00:03:00.090> as

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
way in what we need to do pretty soon as

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.870 
way in what we need to do pretty soon as
zoom<00:03:00.600> out<00:03:00.830> because<00:03:01.830> sometimes<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.430> can<00:03:02.610> zoom

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
zoom out because sometimes you can zoom

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.720 
zoom out because sometimes you can zoom
so<00:03:03.240> far<00:03:03.510> in<00:03:03.750> that<00:03:04.080> you're<00:03:04.800> really<00:03:05.130> missing<00:03:05.400> the

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
so far in that you're really missing the

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.090 
so far in that you're really missing the
overall<00:03:06.240> point<00:03:06.630> or<00:03:06.930> that<00:03:07.110> you<00:03:07.260> focus<00:03:07.560> too<00:03:07.890> much

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
overall point or that you focus too much

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.700 
overall point or that you focus too much
on<00:03:08.520> little<00:03:08.940> details<00:03:09.150> that<00:03:09.660> you<00:03:10.290> miss<00:03:10.500> some<00:03:10.680> of

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
on little details that you miss some of

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.340 
on little details that you miss some of
the<00:03:10.830> bigger<00:03:11.040> details<00:03:11.660> we<00:03:12.660> also<00:03:12.870> want<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.260> be

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
the bigger details we also want to be

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.900 
the bigger details we also want to be
asking<00:03:13.680> ourselves<00:03:13.770> as<00:03:14.280> we<00:03:14.670> make<00:03:14.880> these

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
asking ourselves as we make these

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.030 
asking ourselves as we make these
adjustments<00:03:15.210> are<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:16.050> improving<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.770> image

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
adjustments are the improving the image

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.860 
adjustments are the improving the image
not<00:03:17.310> are<00:03:17.550> we<00:03:17.970> doing<00:03:18.300> them<00:03:18.450> just<00:03:18.720> because

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
not are we doing them just because

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.979 
not are we doing them just because
Photoshop<00:03:19.620> can<00:03:19.980> but<00:03:20.820> rather<00:03:21.030> does<00:03:21.870> this

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
Photoshop can but rather does this

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.140 
Photoshop can but rather does this
improve<00:03:22.470> our<00:03:22.680> vision<00:03:23.130> for<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.430> photograph<00:03:23.910> is

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
improve our vision for the photograph is

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.630 
improve our vision for the photograph is
this<00:03:24.330> leading<00:03:24.690> us<00:03:24.930> somewhere<00:03:25.250> go<00:03:26.250> ahead<00:03:26.489> and

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
this leading us somewhere go ahead and

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.930 
this leading us somewhere go ahead and
just<00:03:26.760> remove<00:03:27.090> some<00:03:27.360> of<00:03:27.390> these<00:03:27.660> up<00:03:27.959> here<00:03:27.989> and

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
just remove some of these up here and

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.490 
just remove some of these up here and
I'm<00:03:29.940> going<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.150> zoom<00:03:30.180> out<00:03:30.480> I<00:03:30.750> want<00:03:31.110> to<00:03:31.170> see<00:03:31.350> how

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
I'm going to zoom out I want to see how

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.620 
I'm going to zoom out I want to see how
we're<00:03:31.680> doing<00:03:31.709> so<00:03:32.160> far<00:03:32.370> I<00:03:32.610> think<00:03:33.330> we're<00:03:33.450> doing

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
we're doing so far I think we're doing

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.030 
we're doing so far I think we're doing
pretty<00:03:33.750> good<00:03:34.170> if<00:03:34.380> we<00:03:34.500> look<00:03:34.709> at<00:03:34.800> our<00:03:34.920> before

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
pretty good if we look at our before

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.060 
pretty good if we look at our before
here's<00:03:35.640> before<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.480> then<00:03:37.110> there's<00:03:37.470> after

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
here's before and then there's after

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.880 
here's before and then there's after
it's<00:03:38.820> not<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:39.390> real<00:03:39.660> it's<00:03:39.989> not<00:03:40.200> unrealistic

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
it's not so real it's not unrealistic

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.010 
it's not so real it's not unrealistic
but<00:03:41.310> it's<00:03:41.459> just<00:03:41.610> reducing<00:03:42.300> and<00:03:42.420> simplifying

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
but it's just reducing and simplifying

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.020 
but it's just reducing and simplifying
this<00:03:43.230> a<00:03:43.290> little<00:03:43.530> bit<00:03:43.800> it's<00:03:44.280> creating<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:44.850> look

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
this a little bit it's creating a look

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.820 
this a little bit it's creating a look
that<00:03:45.090> has<00:03:45.390> a<00:03:45.420> little<00:03:45.690> bit<00:03:45.900> more<00:03:46.110> soft<00:03:46.470> light

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
that has a little bit more soft light

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.280 
that has a little bit more soft light
now<00:03:47.670> I<00:03:47.700> liked<00:03:48.060> it<00:03:48.209> there<00:03:48.360> are<00:03:48.510> still<00:03:48.810> some<00:03:48.989> skin

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
now I liked it there are still some skin

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.650 
now I liked it there are still some skin
variations<00:03:49.950> here<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:50.430> with<00:03:50.610> this<00:03:50.790> image<00:03:51.000> I'm

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
variations here and with this image I'm

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.780 
variations here and with this image I'm
not<00:03:51.870> interested<00:03:52.230> in<00:03:52.620> softening<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.310> skin<00:03:53.340> out

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
not interested in softening the skin out

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.940 
not interested in softening the skin out
so<00:03:53.820> that<00:03:54.270> it<00:03:54.360> looks<00:03:54.600> like<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:55.380> beauty<00:03:55.830> or

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
so that it looks like a beauty or

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.860 
so that it looks like a beauty or
fashion<00:03:56.430> shot<00:03:56.700> or<00:03:56.880> something<00:03:57.030> like<00:03:57.360> that<00:03:57.420> I

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
fashion shot or something like that I

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.440 
fashion shot or something like that I
want<00:03:58.350> to<00:03:58.440> have<00:03:58.560> a<00:03:58.590> bit<00:03:58.830> of<00:03:58.860> grit<00:03:59.310> yet<00:04:00.060> it<00:04:00.239> is

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
want to have a bit of grit yet it is

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.660 
want to have a bit of grit yet it is
nice<00:04:00.720> how<00:04:00.989> we<00:04:01.050> reduced<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:01.800> simplified<00:04:02.400> I

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
nice how we reduced and simplified I

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.520 
nice how we reduced and simplified I
think<00:04:03.420> it's<00:04:03.570> a<00:04:03.690> little<00:04:03.900> bit<00:04:04.050> more<00:04:04.350> of<00:04:04.500> a

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
think it's a little bit more of a

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.220 
think it's a little bit more of a
flattering<00:04:05.100> look<00:04:05.400> I<00:04:05.670> think<00:04:05.970> that<00:04:06.450> Chris<00:04:07.050> would

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
flattering look I think that Chris would

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.900 
flattering look I think that Chris would
actually<00:04:07.590> like<00:04:07.739> this<00:04:08.010> knowing<00:04:08.250> Chris<00:04:08.640> he's

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
actually like this knowing Chris he's

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.820 
actually like this knowing Chris he's
into<00:04:09.360> looks<00:04:09.780> that<00:04:09.959> are<00:04:10.050> authentic<00:04:10.590> that<00:04:10.709> her

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
into looks that are authentic that her

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.120 
into looks that are authentic that her
real<00:04:11.070> that<00:04:11.820> capture<00:04:12.300> a<00:04:12.330> bit<00:04:12.570> of<00:04:12.720> who<00:04:12.900> he<00:04:13.110> is<00:04:13.140> so

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
real that capture a bit of who he is so
