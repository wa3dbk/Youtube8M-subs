hey<00:00:00.980> folks<00:00:01.249> androidcentral<00:00:02.149> here<00:00:02.389> we<00:00:02.570> have

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:02.810 
hey folks androidcentral here we have

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.830 
hey folks androidcentral here we have
got<00:00:03.020> a<00:00:03.290> droid<00:00:03.770> eris<00:00:04.070> and<00:00:04.370> a<00:00:04.940> motorola<00:00:05.420> droid

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:05.840 
got a droid eris and a motorola droid

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.410 
got a droid eris and a motorola droid
both<00:00:06.080> on<00:00:06.290> verizon<00:00:06.320> and<00:00:07.070> so<00:00:07.820> it<00:00:07.970> only<00:00:08.060> seems

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:08.420 
both on verizon and so it only seems

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.570 
both on verizon and so it only seems
fitting<00:00:08.660> that<00:00:08.840> we<00:00:09.260> do<00:00:09.470> a<00:00:09.500> comparison<00:00:10.400> between

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580 
fitting that we do a comparison between

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.940 
fitting that we do a comparison between
the<00:00:10.850> two<00:00:11.120> we're<00:00:11.420> going<00:00:11.540> to<00:00:11.600> do<00:00:11.930> a<00:00:11.960> browser

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
the two we're going to do a browser

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.710 
the two we're going to do a browser
comparison<00:00:13.640> between<00:00:13.760> the<00:00:13.940> two<00:00:14.150> we<00:00:14.330> know<00:00:14.450> that

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:14.720 
comparison between the two we know that

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.529 
comparison between the two we know that
the<00:00:15.050> moto<00:00:15.710> droid<00:00:15.830> has<00:00:16.279> got<00:00:16.490> a<00:00:16.849> little<00:00:17.029> bit<00:00:17.210> more

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
the moto droid has got a little bit more

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:19.749 
the moto droid has got a little bit more
speed<00:00:18.169> in<00:00:18.380> its<00:00:18.499> processor<00:00:19.099> and<00:00:19.369> we<00:00:19.579> know<00:00:19.730> that

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:19.759 
speed in its processor and we know that

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:22.659 
speed in its processor and we know that
the<00:00:20.269> sense<00:00:20.539> takes<00:00:20.779> up<00:00:20.929> a<00:00:21.019> lot<00:00:21.169> of<00:00:21.199> space<00:00:21.560> on<00:00:21.800> the

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:22.669 
the sense takes up a lot of space on the

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.749 
the sense takes up a lot of space on the
erest<00:00:23.060> in<00:00:23.810> terms<00:00:24.050> of<00:00:24.230> overheads<00:00:24.739> so<00:00:25.159> we're

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:25.759 
erest in terms of overheads so we're

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:26.979 
erest in terms of overheads so we're
going<00:00:25.849> to<00:00:25.939> clear<00:00:26.119> both<00:00:26.300> the<00:00:26.419> cash<00:00:26.599> is<00:00:26.779> on<00:00:26.899> the

00:00:26.979 --> 00:00:26.989 
going to clear both the cash is on the

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:29.950 
going to clear both the cash is on the
browsers<00:00:27.380> and<00:00:27.739> we<00:00:28.069> are<00:00:28.310> going<00:00:28.609> to<00:00:29.119> see<00:00:29.689> which

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
browsers and we are going to see which

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.139 
browsers and we are going to see which
can<00:00:30.199> render<00:00:30.649> a<00:00:30.679> page<00:00:30.919> better<00:00:31.159> one<00:00:31.909> quick<00:00:32.119> note

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
can render a page better one quick note

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:33.759 
can render a page better one quick note
it's<00:00:32.539> really<00:00:32.960> difficult<00:00:33.109> to<00:00:33.379> tell<00:00:33.530> from<00:00:33.559> the

00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:33.769 
it's really difficult to tell from the

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:35.920 
it's really difficult to tell from the
screen<00:00:34.070> here<00:00:34.340> but<00:00:34.910> actually<00:00:35.090> the<00:00:35.480> on<00:00:35.750> the

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
screen here but actually the on the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.410 
screen here but actually the on the
right<00:00:36.170> the<00:00:36.920> droid<00:00:37.489> actually<00:00:38.030> has<00:00:38.149> a<00:00:38.179> much

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
right the droid actually has a much

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.240 
right the droid actually has a much
nicer<00:00:38.629> looking<00:00:39.050> screen<00:00:39.469> not<00:00:39.739> just<00:00:39.980> because<00:00:40.100> of

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
nicer looking screen not just because of

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.520 
nicer looking screen not just because of
the<00:00:40.370> extra<00:00:40.789> pixels<00:00:41.120> but<00:00:41.690> also<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.320> white

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
the extra pixels but also the white

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.169 
the extra pixels but also the white
comes<00:00:42.859> through<00:00:43.100> much<00:00:43.399> wider<00:00:43.670> whereas<00:00:44.030> there's

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:44.179 
comes through much wider whereas there's

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:46.599 
comes through much wider whereas there's
a<00:00:44.239> red<00:00:44.510> tint<00:00:44.780> on<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.710> ears<00:00:45.920> which<00:00:46.280> is<00:00:46.399> on<00:00:46.519> the

00:00:46.599 --> 00:00:46.609 
a red tint on the ears which is on the

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:47.979 
a red tint on the ears which is on the
left<00:00:46.789> but<00:00:47.089> you<00:00:47.329> can't<00:00:47.480> really<00:00:47.629> tell<00:00:47.780> from<00:00:47.809> the

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
left but you can't really tell from the

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.049 
left but you can't really tell from the
video<00:00:48.079> here<00:00:48.469> and<00:00:48.649> you<00:00:49.339> can<00:00:49.460> see<00:00:49.670> here<00:00:49.910> I<00:00:49.940> am

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
video here and you can see here I am

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.750 
video here and you can see here I am
attempting<00:00:50.449> to<00:00:50.750> type<00:00:51.109> on<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:51.800> default

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
attempting to type on the default

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.470 
attempting to type on the default
android<00:00:53.239> keyboard<00:00:53.449> and<00:00:54.160> well<00:00:55.160> I<00:00:55.460> need<00:00:56.300> some

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
android keyboard and well I need some

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.770 
android keyboard and well I need some
practice<00:00:56.629> to<00:00:57.109> say<00:00:57.649> the<00:00:57.800> least<00:00:58.539> this<00:00:59.539> is<00:00:59.749> a

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
practice to say the least this is a

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.020 
practice to say the least this is a
reason<00:01:00.170> to<00:01:00.379> consider<00:01:00.859> the<00:01:01.129> ira's<00:01:01.489> over<00:01:01.850> the

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
reason to consider the ira's over the

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.880 
reason to consider the ira's over the
droid<00:01:02.269> even<00:01:02.600> though<00:01:02.749> the<00:01:02.960> droid<00:01:03.199> is<00:01:03.409> the<00:01:03.559> more

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
droid even though the droid is the more

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.800 
droid even though the droid is the more
popular<00:01:04.400> phone<00:01:05.180> at<00:01:05.450> least<00:01:05.600> in<00:01:05.720> the

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
popular phone at least in the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.770 
popular phone at least in the
blogosphere<00:01:06.020> right<00:01:06.530> now<00:01:07.270> because<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.450> the

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
blogosphere right now because the the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.690 
blogosphere right now because the the
keyboard<00:01:09.200> on<00:01:09.410> the<00:01:09.440> eris<00:01:10.130> is<00:01:10.280> just<00:01:10.460> so<00:01:10.580> much

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
keyboard on the eris is just so much

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.880 
keyboard on the eris is just so much
easier<00:01:10.760> to<00:01:11.090> use<00:01:11.240> software<00:01:11.660> wise<00:01:11.900> one<00:01:12.740> other

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
easier to use software wise one other

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.140 
easier to use software wise one other
notable<00:01:13.250> thing<00:01:13.370> you<00:01:13.460> see<00:01:13.580> me<00:01:13.700> jammed<00:01:13.970> my

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
notable thing you see me jammed my

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.660 
notable thing you see me jammed my
finger<00:01:14.180> around<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:14.900> eris<00:01:15.890> defaults<00:01:16.640> to

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
finger around the eris defaults to

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.540 
finger around the eris defaults to
hiding<00:01:17.270> all<00:01:17.420> of<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:17.960> extra<00:01:18.770> elements<00:01:19.190> whereas

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
hiding all of the extra elements whereas

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.970 
hiding all of the extra elements whereas
on<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:20.570> droid<00:01:20.810> they've<00:01:21.170> got<00:01:21.380> that<00:01:21.530> menu<00:01:21.740> bar

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
on the droid they've got that menu bar

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.650 
on the droid they've got that menu bar
up<00:01:22.100> at<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:22.310> top<00:01:22.460> which<00:01:22.760> is<00:01:22.940> kind<00:01:23.450> of<00:01:23.480> funny

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
up at the top which is kind of funny

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.660 
up at the top which is kind of funny
Here<00:01:24.530> I<00:01:24.560> am<00:01:24.650> typing<00:01:24.890> away<00:01:25.070> at<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:25.370> ears<00:01:25.520> and

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
Here I am typing away at the ears and

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.700 
Here I am typing away at the ears and
you<00:01:26.090> can<00:01:26.300> see<00:01:26.510> I<00:01:26.540> am<00:01:26.810> having<00:01:27.200> a<00:01:27.290> much<00:01:27.500> easier

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
you can see I am having a much easier

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.650 
you can see I am having a much easier
time<00:01:28.100> of<00:01:28.160> it<00:01:28.370> it's<00:01:28.760> a<00:01:28.820> much<00:01:29.060> better<00:01:29.090> software

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
time of it it's a much better software

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.990 
time of it it's a much better software
keyboard<00:01:30.080> all<00:01:31.070> right<00:01:31.190> well<00:01:31.310> let's<00:01:31.460> hit<00:01:31.640> go<00:01:31.820> and

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
keyboard all right well let's hit go and

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.730 
keyboard all right well let's hit go and
let's<00:01:32.810> start<00:01:33.020> counting<00:01:33.700> and<00:01:35.140> we<00:01:36.140> are<00:01:36.320> loading

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
let's start counting and we are loading

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.450 
let's start counting and we are loading
and<00:01:36.980> it<00:01:37.640> is<00:01:38.000> taken<00:01:38.870> a<00:01:39.020> fair<00:01:39.860> bit<00:01:40.070> of<00:01:40.130> time<00:01:40.220> I

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
and it is taken a fair bit of time I

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.190 
and it is taken a fair bit of time I
think<00:01:40.910> we're<00:01:41.180> actually<00:01:41.330> suffering<00:01:41.960> under

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
think we're actually suffering under

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.320 
think we're actually suffering under
some<00:01:42.440> traffic<00:01:42.950> load<00:01:43.310> over<00:01:43.550> at<00:01:43.670> androidcentral

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
some traffic load over at androidcentral
