00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.350
 something very important when we talk about the correct selection of food 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.039
 is that today we have many foods since last past Thursday 

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:12.309
 that means we already have processed impediments 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.980
 and that already come with a very important information that is the label montilla 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.109
 jump like eaves 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.109
 Following success 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.609
 when there is no supermarket to buy 

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:38.289
 many times to select the products that use texts like the 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:44.499
 taste maybe the presentations the settlers two ties even if there 

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:47.850
 some demonstration had some outside the product 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.570
 but something very important that we ignore is the nutritional value 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.040
 and many times people do not leave out because they do not know how this would be 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.190
 correctly an artist label 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.880
 that's why we'll see what I accepted with screens that explain in detail what 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.790
 are steps with the transfer very simple is going to be able to learn 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.150
 how the bad etiquette is interpreted 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.750
 the first step to correctly interpret the information 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.650
 nutritional and nutritional label 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.140
 this touch terminal the bad performance that is experienced in the top 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.970
 of the label always well the money of the nation sector 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.440
 in that information so that it was in opposition in this case 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.790
 apple with a gross margin that is a major threat to prepare and up 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.200
 it tells us that the nutritional information the singer in any 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.870
 case 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.470
 is what a quarter cup means 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.930
 and that is the function entrusted descend 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.160
 we also observe being part of this tie for example 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.030
 the architect in using 6 12 parts of a living room in this 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.820
 presentation 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.050
 and that's very important because she's all the labeling information there 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.320
 I was with respect to the whole pregnancy 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.120
 not only with respect to the training that in this case 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.560
 this in four decades 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.470
 another example can be this the case of the average for example in this space 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.729
 we can see that in the first part he says 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:15.080
 he says it's wrong 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.629
 - That's why I'm very happy to be here 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.379
 in another order synopsis of the following year that has 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.359
 it is more difficult two portions 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.929
 this is the size of the efforts of public companies 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:30.669
 the rest of vegetable formations 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:33.729
 Astrated with respect to first level 

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:35.759
 in this session this Tuesday 

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:38.159
 there is no more unemployment 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.559
 now in the case of those temptations 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:43.699
 rivals much easier for example here I have 

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:45.339
 the weight fighter 

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:48.289
 in which the label 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:52.509
 goodbye to the Palestinian question good the package from cc oo the four crimes 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.950
 efe 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.029
 in this context it is necessary to easier 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:56.549
 because we know that this added 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.939
 formation this label with respect to getafe 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.299
 for example in the case of 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.299
 in the third quarter 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.039
 the diplomat label 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:10.729
 the Celtic to places draw without goals 

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:12.560
 but when we have both hobbies 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.859
 in more quantity 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.539
 percent 

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:18.929
 you have to be careful because many times the official information the state 

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:21.069
 for an outpatient consultation 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.029
 the second factor was the argentine star which is the position of the 

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:29.689
 food is what the label tells us now yes we are going to proceed 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:31.209
 in the lecture 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.449
 of the motrileÃ±os December we started by the genre that the reading that the 

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:40.099
 telemedicine then let's get ahead the first fact that is how many 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:41.259
 skin calories 

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:46.309
 per serving of that food this is very important because the calories all the 

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:48.649
 energy that we use 

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:51.629
 while those of feeding plans 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.059
 the director of theaters 

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:57.059
 to determine the amount of calories a cheerful person 

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:01.649
 then because you are using a packaged product because 

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:03.460
 see progress 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.590
 the amount of calories they are consuming in different products 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.290
 packed reading the dgt also in that part gives us information about this 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.970
 amount of fats will split two proteins and also in some cases 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.860
 retail and some aspects such as vitamins and lion 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.120
 the third step to be able to interpret properly 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.189
 the end of the digital era 

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:30.629
 civil and this is something that few years 

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:33.629
 and it is important that you know 

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:35.379
 the apple trees 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:37.650
 this disease that means that 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.650
 the first year 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:48.020
 the mallorca 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.770
 if the following 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.059
 information 

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:55.050
 so that on Monday 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.050
 this time in 13 matches 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:00.599
 for example that I have 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:03.289
 was the case of the president of the body of 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:05.219
 the list of ingredients deficit 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:07.520
 if the first ingredient of state 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.939
 means that it allows more 

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:14.159
 and the second ingredient of his house the third is his fault 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:17.909
 then the fourth this village 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:21.649
 but that in this case is the first attempt is flattering the second the 

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:24.729
 classic is to say that those are the ingredients of this year 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.180
 luckily the largest amount fires 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.169
 in the case of the truth we go to the list of ingredients and it does not mean that 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.969
 in the first line the text little in those of bird 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:37.629
 the second one is dehydrated fruit 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:40.419
 I have composed of apples and chance 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:41.860
 tiger third time 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.150
 He has also benefited 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.000
 so that when he read the list he entered then the first golfer in 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.340
 greater quantity and the other important orders that yes 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:56.169
 so remember that the next time you go to the supermarket to buy not only 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:59.780
 that have no price in the presentation the tie 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.629
 efe in the manifestation of the movement 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:06.610
 but also check the nutrition information with these three simple steps 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.289
 simple questions 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:10.689
 first I end up taking 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:15.409
 according to buck and some customers starting with the calories the low taxes 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:17.879
 they are carbohydrates fat proteins 

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:21.110
 and the micronutrients that are vitamins and nutrients 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.479
 and third after utility the list of ingredients which 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:28.479
 the winning actor with the largest amount in the smallest amount 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:32.309
 this will allow you to make better pressure 

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:35.309
