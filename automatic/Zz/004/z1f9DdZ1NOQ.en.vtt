given some of the kids here at home
Chromebooks<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.490> think<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.300> great<00:00:27.599> choice<00:00:27.930> for

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
Chromebooks I think a great choice for

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.519 
Chromebooks I think a great choice for
kids<00:00:28.730> partly<00:00:29.730> because<00:00:29.880> there<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.390> Mac<00:00:31.140> an

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
kids partly because there is a Mac an

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.049 
kids partly because there is a Mac an
iMac<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.130> living<00:00:32.399> room<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:32.820> if<00:00:32.880> there's

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
iMac in the living room so if there's

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.500 
iMac in the living room so if there's
anything<00:00:33.270> any<00:00:33.680> your<00:00:34.680> lifting<00:00:35.010> or<00:00:35.510> especially

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
anything any your lifting or especially

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.000 
anything any your lifting or especially
printing<00:00:36.989> printing<00:00:37.410> seems<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.710> be<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> little

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
printing printing seems to be a little

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.670 
printing printing seems to be a little
problematic<00:00:38.460> on<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:38.879> original<00:00:39.780> Chromebook

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
problematic on that original Chromebook

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.190 
problematic on that original Chromebook

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
that we got that reason a little 11 inch

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.819 
that we got that reason a little 11 inch

a MacBook Air now it's an 11 inch but I

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.010 
a MacBook Air now it's an 11 inch but I

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
think for a student that's a perfect

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.070 
think for a student that's a perfect
choice<00:01:19.140> very<00:01:19.470> light<00:01:19.799> very<00:01:20.070> small<00:01:20.600> I<00:01:21.600> think

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
choice very light very small I think

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.050 
choice very light very small I think
that's<00:01:22.200> actually<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.530> great<00:01:22.650> choice<00:01:23.030> yeah<00:01:24.030> I

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
that's actually a great choice yeah I

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.850 
that's actually a great choice yeah I

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
twos that are supposed to come out any

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.719 
twos that are supposed to come out any
day<00:01:27.659> now<00:01:27.840> including<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.920> Samsung<00:01:29.369> one<00:01:29.549> with

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
day now including that Samsung one with

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.840 
day now including that Samsung one with
the<00:01:29.850> faux<00:01:30.180> leather<00:01:30.630> top<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.530> was<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.340> skeptical

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
the faux leather top I was so skeptical

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.340 
the faux leather top I was so skeptical
about<00:01:33.150> Chromebooks<00:01:33.659> when<00:01:33.780> they<00:01:33.869> first<00:01:34.110> came

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
about Chromebooks when they first came

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.749 
about Chromebooks when they first came
out<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.590> thought<00:01:34.829> why<00:01:35.009> would<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.369> spend<00:01:35.610> money

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
out I thought why would you spend money

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.969 
out I thought why would you spend money
on<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.119> computer<00:01:37.110> that's<00:01:37.259> nothing<00:01:37.619> more<00:01:37.770> than<00:01:37.920> a

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
on a computer that's nothing more than a

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.210 
on a computer that's nothing more than a
glorified<00:01:38.490> browser<00:01:39.530> but<00:01:40.530> what's<00:01:40.770> happened

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
glorified browser but what's happened

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.950 
glorified browser but what's happened
over<00:01:41.280> time<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.670> we<00:01:42.119> first<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.540> all<00:01:42.630> we<00:01:42.750> could<00:01:42.840> do

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
over time is we first of all we could do

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.469

four tabs but he just learns to live
with<00:03:45.780> that<00:03:45.959> these<00:03:46.380> have<00:03:46.590> more<00:03:46.769> RAM<00:03:47.040> they've

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
with that these have more RAM they've

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.890 
with that these have more RAM they've
two<00:03:47.400> gigs<00:03:47.609> of<00:03:47.730> RAM<00:03:47.970> I<00:03:48.299> think<00:03:48.720> it's<00:03:49.370> even<00:03:50.370> better

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
two gigs of RAM I think it's even better

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.120 
two gigs of RAM I think it's even better
okay<00:03:51.900> even<00:03:52.200> better<00:03:52.380> yeah<00:03:52.620> you're<00:03:52.829> not<00:03:52.950> gonna

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
okay even better yeah you're not gonna

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.039 
okay even better yeah you're not gonna
have<00:03:53.250> any<00:03:53.400> trouble<00:03:53.579> and<00:03:54.269> these<00:03:54.510> are<00:03:54.660> faster

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
have any trouble and these are faster

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.120 
have any trouble and these are faster
processors<00:03:55.680> they're<00:03:55.889> a<00:03:55.920> little<00:03:56.040> more

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
processors they're a little more

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.039 
processors they're a little more
expensive<00:03:56.250> this<00:03:57.120> is<00:03:57.329> what<00:03:57.480> I<00:03:57.510> always<00:03:57.780> thought

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
expensive this is what I always thought

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.390 
expensive this is what I always thought
Google<00:03:58.380> should<00:03:58.530> do<00:03:58.709> it's<00:03:58.980> good<00:03:59.130> to<00:03:59.220> have<00:03:59.370> a

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
Google should do it's good to have a

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.809 
Google should do it's good to have a

$200 $250 model they also sell for

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.789

Chromebook<00:04:05.310> pixel<00:04:05.340> that's<00:04:06.299> way<00:04:06.630> crazy

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
Chromebook pixel that's way crazy

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.710 
Chromebook pixel that's way crazy
I<00:04:07.319> actually<00:04:07.859> I<00:04:08.220> have<00:04:08.549> that<00:04:08.819> one<00:04:08.970> it's<00:04:09.120> nice<00:04:09.329> but

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
I actually I have that one it's nice but

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.670 
I actually I have that one it's nice but
it's<00:04:09.870> crazy

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
it's crazy

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.229 
it's crazy
but<00:04:11.220> I<00:04:11.430> always<00:04:11.639> thought<00:04:11.880> that<00:04:11.940> should<00:04:12.120> have

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
but I always thought that should have

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.699 
but I always thought that should have
something<00:04:12.450> in<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.630> middle<00:04:12.750> three<00:04:13.170> to<00:04:13.410> five

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
something in the middle three to five

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.440 
something in the middle three to five
hundred<00:04:13.739> bucks<00:04:14.190> that<00:04:14.850> has<00:04:15.000> more<00:04:15.269> horsepower

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
hundred bucks that has more horsepower

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.870 
hundred bucks that has more horsepower
there's<00:04:16.289> a<00:04:16.410> nicer<00:04:16.769> computer<00:04:17.220> better<00:04:17.400> screen

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
there's a nicer computer better screen

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.879 
there's a nicer computer better screen
higher<00:04:18.419> res<00:04:18.720> screen<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.260> I<00:04:19.560> think<00:04:19.769> that's

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
higher res screen and I think that's

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.199 
higher res screen and I think that's
what<00:04:19.979> these<00:04:20.070> Chromebook<00:04:20.459> twos<00:04:20.669> are<00:04:20.849> aimed<00:04:21.000> at

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
what these Chromebook twos are aimed at

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.990 
what these Chromebook twos are aimed at
and<00:04:21.390> I<00:04:21.419> do<00:04:22.049> think<00:04:22.470> they're<00:04:22.620> fine<00:04:22.860> you<00:04:23.760> should

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
and I do think they're fine you should

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.370 
and I do think they're fine you should
think<00:04:24.210> about<00:04:24.360> what<00:04:24.630> you're<00:04:24.810> gonna<00:04:24.870> lose<00:04:25.140> so

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
think about what you're gonna lose so

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.980 
think about what you're gonna lose so

one<00:04:26.169> you<00:04:26.440> don't<00:04:26.560> have<00:04:26.650> iTunes<00:04:26.949> but<00:04:27.669> I<00:04:27.729> think

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
one you don't have iTunes but I think

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.339 
one you don't have iTunes but I think
there's<00:04:28.090> a<00:04:28.180> way<00:04:28.210> around<00:04:28.419> that<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:29.199> other

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:29.349 
there's a way around that the other

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:32.219 
there's a way around that the other
maybe<00:04:29.590> more<00:04:29.889> important<00:04:30.520> in<00:04:30.610> this<00:04:30.940> only<00:04:31.270> the

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
maybe more important in this only the

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.680 
maybe more important in this only the
school<00:04:32.470> know<00:04:32.800> will<00:04:33.460> instructors<00:04:34.120> require<00:04:34.270> her

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
school know will instructors require her

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.529 
school know will instructors require her
to<00:04:34.810> run<00:04:34.990> software<00:04:35.520> because<00:04:36.520> she<00:04:36.669> can't<00:04:36.970> she'll

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
to run software because she can't she'll

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:38.939 
to run software because she can't she'll
have<00:04:37.660> to<00:04:37.720> go<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:37.990> computer<00:04:38.500> lab<00:04:38.650> to<00:04:38.710> do

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949 
have to go to the computer lab to do

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:41.430 
have to go to the computer lab to do
that<00:04:39.160> so<00:04:39.430> if<00:04:39.970> she's<00:04:40.270> taking<00:04:40.599> a<00:04:40.750> computer-aided

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
that so if she's taking a computer-aided

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.760 
that so if she's taking a computer-aided
design<00:04:41.949> course<00:04:42.610> for<00:04:42.880> instance<00:04:43.000> and<00:04:43.560> and<00:04:44.560> they

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
design course for instance and and they

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.409 
design course for instance and and they
say<00:04:44.979> well<00:04:45.160> you<00:04:45.340> got<00:04:45.460> to<00:04:45.550> have<00:04:45.639> auto<00:04:45.819> cad<00:04:46.180> well

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
say well you got to have auto cad well

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:47.249 
say well you got to have auto cad well
you're<00:04:46.539> not<00:04:46.660> gonna<00:04:46.780> run<00:04:46.960> that<00:04:47.110> on<00:04:47.229> a

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 
you're not gonna run that on a

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:49.860 
you're not gonna run that on a
Chromebook<00:04:47.530> so<00:04:48.060> right<00:04:49.060> that<00:04:49.270> would<00:04:49.449> be<00:04:49.509> that

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
Chromebook so right that would be that

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.510 
Chromebook so right that would be that
would<00:04:49.990> be<00:04:50.020> one<00:04:50.380> area<00:04:50.590> where<00:04:50.830> not<00:04:51.069> having<00:04:51.460> a

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
would be one area where not having a

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.610 
would be one area where not having a
computer<00:04:51.880> might<00:04:52.090> be<00:04:52.240> a<00:04:52.270> disadvantage<00:04:52.509> is<00:04:53.410> this

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
computer might be a disadvantage is this

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.939 
computer might be a disadvantage is this
her<00:04:53.740> first<00:04:53.800> year<00:04:54.599> yeah<00:04:55.630> no<00:04:55.930> no<00:04:56.229> freshman<00:04:56.560> class

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
her first year yeah no no freshman class

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:02.219 
her first year yeah no no freshman class
is<00:04:57.099> gonna<00:04:57.310> require<00:04:58.440> no<00:05:00.509> well<00:05:01.509> it<00:05:01.720> might<00:05:01.930> now

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
is gonna require no well it might now

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:03.270 
is gonna require no well it might now
that's<00:05:02.470> interesting<00:05:02.830> there<00:05:03.099> may<00:05:03.250> be

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
that's interesting there may be

those early Chromebook ads they had a

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:45.060 
those early Chromebook ads they had a
dog<00:05:42.430> and<00:05:43.000> it<00:05:43.750> was<00:05:43.900> that<00:05:44.289> the<00:05:44.320> point<00:05:44.770> of<00:05:44.889> it<00:05:44.979> was

this<00:05:45.190> is<00:05:45.340> such<00:05:45.490> a<00:05:45.580> cheap<00:05:45.759> computer<00:05:46.150> you<00:05:46.240> don't

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:46.389 
this is such a cheap computer you don't

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:48.600 
this is such a cheap computer you don't
care<00:05:46.570> if<00:05:46.630> the<00:05:46.719> dog<00:05:46.870> slurps<00:05:47.380> on<00:05:47.620> it<00:05:47.800> because<00:05:48.490> you

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
care if the dog slurps on it because you

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:56.520 
care if the dog slurps on it because you
just<00:05:48.789> buy<00:05:54.449> no<00:05:55.449> I<00:05:55.479> think<00:05:55.719> you'd<00:05:55.990> be<00:05:56.080> very<00:05:56.229> I

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
just buy no I think you'd be very I

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.050 
just buy no I think you'd be very I
think<00:05:57.039> you'd<00:05:57.159> be<00:05:57.250> very<00:05:57.520> happy<00:05:57.789> with<00:05:58.000> the

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
think you'd be very happy with the

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.059 
think you'd be very happy with the
Chromebook<00:05:58.300> I've<00:05:58.870> completely<00:05:59.500> come<00:05:59.830> full

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:00.069 
Chromebook I've completely come full

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:02.100 
Chromebook I've completely come full
circle<00:06:00.099> on<00:06:00.580> that<00:06:00.789> I<00:06:00.969> think<00:06:01.449> schools<00:06:01.780> that<00:06:02.020> are

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
circle on that I think schools that are

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.959 
circle on that I think schools that are
doing<00:06:02.169> one-to-one<00:06:02.770> programs<00:06:03.219> instead<00:06:03.880> of

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:03.969 
doing one-to-one programs instead of

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:06.749 
doing one-to-one programs instead of
giving<00:06:04.180> students<00:06:04.449> iPads<00:06:04.930> or<00:06:05.430> laptops<00:06:06.430> really

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:06.759 
giving students iPads or laptops really

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:08.159 
giving students iPads or laptops really
should<00:06:06.940> consider<00:06:07.000> Chromebooks<00:06:07.690> they're

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 
should consider Chromebooks they're

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:10.589 
should consider Chromebooks they're
secure<00:06:08.860> you<00:06:09.550> can't<00:06:09.880> get<00:06:10.030> in<00:06:10.120> trouble<00:06:10.479> with

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:10.599 
secure you can't get in trouble with

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:13.350 
secure you can't get in trouble with
them<00:06:10.840> if<00:06:11.770> you<00:06:11.949> do<00:06:12.159> the<00:06:12.460> power<00:06:12.669> wash<00:06:12.969> makes<00:06:13.240> it

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
them if you do the power wash makes it

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.879 
them if you do the power wash makes it
easy<00:06:13.509> and<00:06:13.719> and<00:06:14.080> everything's<00:06:14.500> stored<00:06:14.740> in<00:06:14.800> the

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:14.889 
easy and and everything's stored in the

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:16.379 
easy and and everything's stored in the
cloud<00:06:15.069> so<00:06:15.669> if<00:06:15.729> she<00:06:15.880> wants<00:06:16.000> something<00:06:16.270> more
