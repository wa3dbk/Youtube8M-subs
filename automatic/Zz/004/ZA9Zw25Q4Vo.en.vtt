this<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.200> best<00:00:10.410> variant<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.250> HBR<00:00:11.730> that

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880

I<00:00:11.910> know<00:00:12.000> of<00:00:12.389> I<00:00:12.660> think<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:12.990> second<00:00:13.380> best

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.709 
I know of I think the second best
variant<00:00:13.889> has<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.730> be<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.969> average<00:00:15.150> Joe

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.599 
variant has to be the average Joe
because<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.260> has<00:00:16.379> up<00:00:16.650> one<00:00:16.859> ranging<00:00:17.340> up<00:00:17.460> one

from<00:03:03.989> especially<00:03:04.470> in<00:03:04.739> called<00:03:04.980> video<00:03:05.220> ghosts

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
from especially in called video ghosts

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.580 
from especially in called video ghosts
never<00:03:06.150> capture<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:06.870> flag<00:03:07.079> when<00:03:07.349> you're<00:03:07.500> on<00:03:07.560> a

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
never capture a flag when you're on a

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.900 
never capture a flag when you're on a
killer<00:03:07.829> trick<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.220> that<00:03:08.579> should<00:03:08.760> make<00:03:08.849> sense

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
killer trick and that should make sense

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.460 
killer trick and that should make sense
anyways<00:03:09.510> because<00:03:09.780> whenever<00:03:09.959> you<00:03:10.140> capture<00:03:10.440> a

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
anyways because whenever you capture a

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.530 
anyways because whenever you capture a
flag<00:03:10.620> it's<00:03:11.010> you<00:03:11.610> know<00:03:11.700> telling<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.120> enemy<00:03:12.209> oh

the enemies over at a go kill him and he

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.610

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
your guys's mini-map your mini-map is

your guys's mini-map your mini-map is
your<00:03:38.190> best<00:03:38.459> friend<00:03:38.730> it<00:03:39.000> really<00:03:39.420> is<00:03:39.569> the

your best friend it really is the

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.050 
your best friend it really is the
mini-map<00:03:40.290> is<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:41.010> most<00:03:41.190> important<00:03:41.700> thing<00:03:41.880> in

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
mini-map is the most important thing in

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.940 
mini-map is the most important thing in
this<00:03:42.180> game<00:03:42.299> and<00:03:42.720> it<00:03:42.840> was<00:03:42.959> in<00:03:43.200> black<00:03:43.350> ops<00:03:43.560> 2<00:03:43.799> as

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
this game and it was in black ops 2 as

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.879 
this game and it was in black ops 2 as
well<00:03:44.130> and<00:03:45.060> called<00:03:45.780> it<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:45.989> ghost<00:03:46.170> on<00:03:46.410> the

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
well and called it a ghost on the

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.949 
well and called it a ghost on the
mini-map<00:03:47.220> wasn't<00:03:47.639> as<00:03:47.760> important<00:03:48.540> because<00:03:48.660> you

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
mini-map wasn't as important because you

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.349 
mini-map wasn't as important because you
can<00:03:49.109> actually<00:03:49.260> hear<00:03:50.040> people's<00:03:50.489> footsteps<00:03:51.120> and

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
can actually hear people's footsteps and

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:52.940 
can actually hear people's footsteps and
that's<00:03:51.720> what<00:03:51.930> kind<00:03:52.079> of<00:03:52.230> made<00:03:52.350> ghosts<00:03:52.799> you<00:03:52.920> know

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
that's what kind of made ghosts you know

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.590 
that's what kind of made ghosts you know
easy<00:03:53.400> you<00:03:53.639> can<00:03:53.760> hear<00:03:53.940> footsteps<00:03:54.180> and

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
easy you can hear footsteps and

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.839 
easy you can hear footsteps and
therefore<00:03:55.500> hearing<00:03:55.889> footsteps<00:03:56.069> there<00:03:56.579> for

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
therefore hearing footsteps there for

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.270 
therefore hearing footsteps there for
killing<00:03:57.660> them<00:03:57.840> pre-file<00:03:58.380> in<00:03:58.680> this<00:03:58.829> game<00:03:59.040> you

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
killing them pre-file in this game you

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.059 
killing them pre-file in this game you
can't<00:03:59.519> hear<00:03:59.730> footsteps<00:03:59.940> well<00:04:00.359> you<00:04:00.510> can<00:04:01.069> you

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
to your mini-map your mini-map is the

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.969 
to your mini-map your mini-map is the
most<00:04:15.900> important<00:04:16.530> thing<00:04:16.680> in<00:04:16.799> this<00:04:16.889> game

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
most important thing in this game

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.740 
most important thing in this game
because<00:04:17.340> in<00:04:17.579> black<00:04:17.760> ops<00:04:17.940> 2<00:04:18.060> wasn't<00:04:18.510> it

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
because in black ops 2 wasn't it

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.750 
because in black ops 2 wasn't it
black<00:04:19.019> ops<00:04:19.200> 2<00:04:19.380> it<00:04:19.829> was<00:04:19.979> important<00:04:20.400> as<00:04:20.549> well

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
black ops 2 it was important as well

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.069 
black ops 2 it was important as well
because<00:04:20.940> you<00:04:21.030> couldn't<00:04:21.239> hear<00:04:21.329> footsteps<00:04:21.630> in

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.140 
because you couldn't hear footsteps in
this<00:04:22.320> game<00:04:22.500> your<00:04:23.130> mini-map<00:04:23.430> is<00:04:23.580> important<00:04:24.060> the

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
this game your mini-map is important the

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.909 
this game your mini-map is important the
reason<00:04:24.419> why<00:04:24.539> I<00:04:24.570> said<00:04:24.870> this<00:04:24.990> is<00:04:25.169> because<00:04:25.530> if

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
reason why I said this is because if

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.770 
reason why I said this is because if
you're<00:04:26.159> 25<00:04:26.760> gun<00:04:27.150> Street

you're 25 gun Street

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.600 
you're 25 gun Street
and<00:04:27.900> you<00:04:28.290> don't<00:04:28.620> have<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:28.920> UAV<00:04:29.280> you're<00:04:29.490> not
