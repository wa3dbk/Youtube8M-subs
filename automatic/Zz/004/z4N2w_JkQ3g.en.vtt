00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.590 
here probably gonna use another one if
it<00:00:48.600> if<00:00:48.960> my<00:00:49.140> manectric<00:00:49.559> lives<00:00:49.950> here<00:00:50.399> let<00:00:51.329> me<00:00:51.420> go

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600

it if my manectric lives here let me go
ahead<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.870> use<00:00:52.230> another<00:00:53.300> quick<00:00:54.300> attack<00:00:54.539> here

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.020 

and<00:01:02.510> I<00:01:03.830> just<00:01:04.830> realized<00:01:05.370> something<00:01:05.520> if<00:01:05.880> this

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
and I just realized something if this

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.940 
and I just realized something if this
thing<00:01:06.300> keeps<00:01:06.600> uh<00:01:09.320> kidding<00:01:10.320> itself<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:10.860> you

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
thing keeps uh kidding itself so you

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.250 
thing keeps uh kidding itself so you
didn't<00:01:11.160> do<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> lot<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.550> recoil<00:01:12.360> girl<00:01:12.870> I<00:01:13.050> don't

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
didn't do a lot of recoil girl I don't

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.350 
didn't do a lot of recoil girl I don't
know<00:01:13.410> if<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.650> should<00:01:13.680> try<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.460> master<00:01:14.850> ball<00:01:15.030> I

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
know if I should try and master ball I

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.350 
know if I should try and master ball I
can't<00:01:15.870> believe<00:01:15.990> I'm<00:01:16.200> even<00:01:16.320> thinking<00:01:16.470> about

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
can't believe I'm even thinking about

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.520 
can't believe I'm even thinking about
master<00:01:18.360> balling<00:01:18.690> this<00:01:18.810> Pikachu<00:01:19.230> which<00:01:19.380> is

master balling this Pikachu which is

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.200 
master balling this Pikachu which is
really<00:01:19.740> stupid<00:01:20.160> because<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.820> didn't<00:01:21.060> think

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
really stupid because I didn't think

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:29.230 
really stupid because I didn't think
about<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.780> even<00:01:22.260> I'm<00:01:22.670> killing<00:01:23.670> himself<00:01:23.820> um<00:01:24.860> I

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.950 

don't<00:01:30.240> know<00:01:30.510> what<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.900> do<00:01:31.020> i'm<00:01:31.170> gonna<00:01:31.350> i<00:01:32.960> think

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
don't know what to do i'm gonna i think

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.710 
don't know what to do i'm gonna i think
i<00:01:34.050> can<00:01:34.200> go<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.380> my<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:35.100> Swampert<00:01:35.910> and<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.450> won't

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
i can go to my a Swampert and it won't

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.930 
i can go to my a Swampert and it won't
do<00:01:37.320> um<00:01:38.869> it<00:01:39.869> won't<00:01:40.140> do<00:01:40.350> leak<00:01:40.740> oil<00:01:40.979> since<00:01:41.520> its<00:01:41.790> not

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
do um it won't do leak oil since its not

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.940 
do um it won't do leak oil since its not
I<00:01:42.000> won't<00:01:42.270> affect<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.440> I'm<00:01:43.500> going<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.710> try

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
I won't affect it so I'm going to try

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.940 
I won't affect it so I'm going to try
and<00:01:44.010> throw<00:01:44.280> my<00:01:44.400> first<00:01:44.430> fall<00:01:44.850> out<00:01:45.030> there<00:01:45.270> I

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
and throw my first fall out there I

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.710 
and throw my first fall out there I
think<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.100> won't<00:01:47.190> recoil<00:01:47.700> since<00:01:48.060> it's<00:01:48.270> um<00:01:48.479> it

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
think it won't recoil since it's um it

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.590 
think it won't recoil since it's um it
doesn't<00:01:48.960> affect<00:01:49.350> me<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:50.090> I'm<00:01:51.090> just<00:01:51.360> go<00:01:51.509> ahead

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
doesn't affect me so I'm just go ahead

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.170 
doesn't affect me so I'm just go ahead
and<00:01:51.720> throw<00:01:51.900> up<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.080> mirror<00:01:52.290> ball<00:01:52.440> up<00:01:52.619> here<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:54.060> I

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
and throw up a mirror ball up here and I

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.580 
and throw up a mirror ball up here and I
think<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.660> won't<00:01:54.720> kill<00:01:54.960> itself<00:01:55.259> with<00:01:55.440> this

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
think it won't kill itself with this

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.310 
think it won't kill itself with this
much<00:01:55.860> HP<00:01:56.280> even<00:01:56.850> if<00:01:56.940> it<00:01:57.060> hits<00:01:57.240> me<00:01:58.670> here<00:01:59.670> we<00:01:59.759> go

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
much HP even if it hits me here we go

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.440 
much HP even if it hits me here we go
one<00:02:01.940> ok<00:02:04.070> ok<00:02:05.070> it's<00:02:05.340> just<00:02:05.369> using<00:02:05.729> agility<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.330> I'm

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
one ok ok it's just using agility so I'm

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.870 
one ok ok it's just using agility so I'm
not<00:02:06.600> sure<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.620> sure<00:02:08.250> hope<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:08.580> doesn't

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
not sure I I sure hope this doesn't

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.930 
not sure I I sure hope this doesn't
