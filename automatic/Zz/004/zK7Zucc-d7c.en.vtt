00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.750
 Hello everyone today I propose the recipe 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.460
 a really quick and easy bread 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.619
 very good with this dough you can 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.029
 do many things including pizza one 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.029
 beautiful focaccia but let's proceed 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:29.269
 first in warm water 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.269
 we will choose abundant spoons of honey 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:48.900
 we combine our cube with honey 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:50.879
 brewer's yeast and mix everything 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.329
 well until it's all 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.329
 melted 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.220
 at this point we will put the flour in 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.399
 a large bowl was we will mix with 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.420
 a fork adding flush to the 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.289
 our honey yeast water mixture 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.660
 simply mixing with the 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:22.350
 fork without doing anything else 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.990
 we mix well until not 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.500
 we will reach a soggy consistency 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.750
 a good choir should not come out 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.750
 very soft and sticky paste 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.210
 I recommend the bowl must be 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:41.880
 big enough because we'll leave it 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:45.000
 rise in. add to the 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.650
 compound I also recommend the salt not 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.110
 do as I do that I was forgotten 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.110
 put a little later but just ok 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.380
 we have finished adding the mixture 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.650
 we are adding salt and stirring 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.650
 well 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.200
 once finished kneading 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.200
 we will add oil 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.340
 oil I can't tell you how far up 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:34.060
 I would say two tablespoons if you really want the 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.430
 however, I add it up to how much 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:41.180
 I don't see the compound a little 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.840
 I can stand out from 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.840
 from the bowl 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.610
 then once finished sprinkle mo the 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.920
 our flour dough and buy it 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.650
 with the film we let it rise 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.300
 two hours and after two hours our dough 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.320
 will be leavened 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.570
 of course you let it rise better 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.240
 at this point you just need to sprinkle 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.400
 of the flour worktop 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.890
 I now have the nail polish so I will try to 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.640
 touch the dough not even possible e 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:48.400
 trying to keep the top 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:52.170
 of the dough towards the top so not 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.730
 turn it over try to get it out 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:58.450
 helping you with your hands in such a way 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:01.630
 of the part above that made type 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:07.170
 a crust here is honest resting 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.170
 upwards i hope i was being tender 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.459
 put the dough and very sticky 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:17.280
 so it will take a little patience to 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:20.530
 let it come out and now you cut it 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.380
 but I assure you that it's worth it 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:26.860
 at this point I will help with one 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.720
 spatula that sprinkle it with flour in 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.250
 in case you throw away even a little above 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:35.470
 to download it because present and much 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:39.070
 sticky you see I'll take from this 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.350
 I knead three strands that I will put on one 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:45.610
 baking sheet covered with parchment paper and 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:50.110
 corner or at 250 degrees putting the dough 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:53.139
 first under soon as the step position 18 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.070
 for 10 minutes in the middle and then finish the 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.070
 cooking upstairs 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.870
 at this point we fire it 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.840
 then our seek are ready 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:17.100
 here they are not nice then me in 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.720
 meanwhile I saw in the fridge 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:31.020
 olives 4 precise olives I have studied and 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:39.510
 put pressure with the sighted finger 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:41.940
 I am beautiful with this same world 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.650
 dough I also made pizza there 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.010
 focaccia you can also do the 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:49.830
 crushed so many things are a bit of 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.660
 patience because it's sticky maybe 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.860
 hands me the oil is a bit of 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.860
 flour to help you 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.100
