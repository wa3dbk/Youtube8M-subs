00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.060
 and welcomes the many questions a third gives she was doing by 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.500
 and I have long thought that we have one with a show like this also 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.179
 started very often to talk to everyone 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:11.009
 So 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:14.900
 yes why should i show more what iran has to say she is sitting i can fly 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.109
 so that makes a difference 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.029
 easy to show cadel, we actually only start once 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.460
 starts when it's over and that's over here 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.490
 he said here 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.140
 also once inside and then you can go in certain directions and 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.550
 that also here in knack a very nice country 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.920
 put squares with the tree in the afternoon 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.060
 then you just suffer from anything and everything 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.610
 the butchery najib childish why is lightning fast things 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.880
 the damage seems to be less than expected, because it is not really seconds down but just 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.050
 cozy 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.100
 so this is the children 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.360
 yes there you see them jerking 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.360
 simply look out at the euro 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.690
 every move 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.410
 i'm so bad and see that 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.660
 we think 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.660
 but can be a sign 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.750
 no one thought of a plastic and I would 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.580
 and then no longer on 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.850
 after built-in 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.960
 x I take it I have you in there and then you can make a move at the 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.350
 third place you see Nieuwpoort is what 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.510
 what you hit and sport 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.820
 I'd say that 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.820
 ah well bit it is starting this newspaper 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.259
 we have here once a year because this is just chef 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.200
 ksg cafÃ© palop december 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.550
 medium-sized bank 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.360
 but then you have an extra thingy of ships and separate rs 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.510
 and you can work faster in that sense, secondly, anyway 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.990
 and yes that would be very cool of course so in itself both then do not have to 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.719
 for the rest you can also do without 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:47.259
 money we do all this fun stuff it's not like anyone ever 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.600
 is they can zoom the area mountains 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.600
 so but it is what you can do 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.380
 I am 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.000
 yes that's what I stuck to the explanation though 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.460
 I am a little let in after it 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.240
 it is an old not i see this as a game it is never that anyone 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.230
 paid money that it is better 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.550
 it's nice that I agree on the nature that is 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.440
 of course there is also if you check that test you can not pay girl has 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.419
 or whatever 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:19.599
 nac that doesn't matter at all for your game and that it is clear that it is 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:20.540
 just nice for on 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.230
 the tgv lobby especially and golden of our sport natural that it happens there 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.259
 Finally 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:27.540
 network port check 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.549
 eext this is from peter 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.439
 and that is even closer comes naturally then takes after silver 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.479
 especially Filipino against the timepiece 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:39.309
 we continue where jan plan again outpost church he says there myself 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:42.339
 very little of music can not explain 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:47.069
 but that will certainly come more information crossing PGGM also on itself 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.649
 count me if I know more about it myself 

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:53.309
 her husband eric wiebes and we see david and things standing 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:57.619
 And this is of course where you will find time and later that we have flat TVs and 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:59.009
 anticipate 

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:01.049
 with me again nice extra 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.360
 this is a trampoline and that is normal 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.360
 without a helmet because it is possible because it is fun 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:10.299
 and we are looking again 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.599
 as you see ien kear eventually get things with the points you 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.429
 finds in this it is so classification points if it is right 

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:18.869
 I don't know exactly how it is said to be 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:22.219
 and you have it with him who shot by writing his heart and theirs 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.789
 because that is simply no longer possible 

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:26.639
 and 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.490
 this is paranoia most soldiers this is also possible but it has been hit by 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:31.710
 very cool game 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.299
 I go I think I also have my bottleneck 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.409
 I am not sure yet whether it is a handsome or just separate from the channel 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:40.769
 I'm going to play it anyway 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.249
 So 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:44.699
 I'd say go and try it out 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:46.430
 then we still have mots here 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.639
 I sat down as the Veb Sky are going 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:53.519
 for that ends here if you what you can appart here in states 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.279
 intended for the quieter place because the images are normally very busy 

00:03:58.279 --> 00:03:59.480
 who's coming with me 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.430
 I am also on I am also the afternoon in which most of them are in school 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.249
 to sit 

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:07.249
 does not make an easy sing out of a diving suit 

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:11.650
 and this is still still there are other ways and things 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.390
 nice extras the bouncer this is the this game 

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:20.529
 and who are during a euro pole dance act on zombies that is possible here? 

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:22.409
 the band in a corner 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.710
 grando kitchens of the favorite 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:25.850
 that's the idea 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.070
 and I can clean up here in a crater you also have your giant if you 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.660
 be right to certain and you want the best that now stand that carrie 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.900
 switches as you see 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.849
 with both 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.720
 but in doing so choose changing your work in a mini game 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.910
 save by year 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.910
 And then your naggers go to everything silently 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.050
 so i would say just go see i am also often show design 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.090
 also to be found often also a realization you always at all times to mobile phone duels 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.969
 find 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:57.509
 so if you like konsekwent I would look at his concert 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:04:59.349
 appointment not yet the epd 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:00.389
 and then you can 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:03.810
 certainly in congo cozy it is of course it is that you can me 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.289
 telling what he is worth does not attract 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:08.430
 so that is just as important to know 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.149
 each two ladies then wear his bus are people who can call 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:14.110
 and then she gets used to it 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.210
 so just make sure you are not going it would have a headset and that is in gouda one 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.050
 kind of well-behaved she leaves the alpine land 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.599
 and oh yeah very tasty 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:27.180
 dow jones greenhouse with inflatables and that is why it was right 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.060
 very funny people who have that can handle people nicely 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:32.900
 Yes 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.469
 the foundation 9 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:37.479
 Tuesday I am very nice and 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.830
 yes I say I also have a nice chat and I am not going to talk to these people either 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.099
 it's for now I'm going to close 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:48.379
 so the liveability and 5 3 to browse despite knowing what you are now heading out of 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.770
 from the director and whether he likes the g7 door 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.150
 and then I'll just see it again next time 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.720
 still people
