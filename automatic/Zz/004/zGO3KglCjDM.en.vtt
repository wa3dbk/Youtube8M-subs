00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.490
 we kids who already bought everyone 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.809
 the only thing i miss only i 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.070
 sweets for the dinner and some ideas 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.070
 because I had prepared together with some 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.760
 Castagnette are innocent from Puglia 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.210
 good 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.490
 I can help you my friend Cecilia 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.130
 today we will see how to prepare the 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.019
 small chestnuts of the typical biscuits 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.439
 its region or the Puglia that yes 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.880
 prepare during the Christmas season 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.190
 we should use a pound of flour 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.579
 double zero a kilo of sugar 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:42.829
 granulated one packet of yeast per 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:51.920
 sweets a kilo of almonds and coffee 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:54.530
 what we need now we recite 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.530
 toasted almonds inside 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.640
 a medium-high heat pan for about 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.350
 10 minutes 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.000
 we have used almonds already 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.479
 peeled but you can very well 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.369
 use almonds with the skin 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:11.840
 once toasted the cicilia almonds 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:14.930
 puts inside a blender and the 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.470
 it collapses a little to get 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.540
 almonds like these for us 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.759
 question of comfort we have decided to 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.950
 halve the doses and mix everything 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.900
 twice simply to do less 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.000
 fatigue 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.830
 in fact we have united 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.050
 of sugar half a kilo of flour n 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.120
 thin almonds thrown now 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.080
 we're going to add second bass for 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.080
 get a soft dough 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.020
 let's try to use coffee 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.310
 room temperature because if it were 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.530
 too hot the mixture would tend to 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.490
 become too soft so we should 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.270
 add flour biscuits 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.039
 then they would be too hard 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.729
 we continue to knead until 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:08.149
 get a dough like this beautiful 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.149
 compact 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.550
 at this point we can go to 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.590
 add the Sicilian yeast told me 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.200
 that the peculiarity of these cookies 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.060
 and just the crunchiness, however, we do not 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.010
 we want them to get too hard 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.420
 so a little bit of yeast there 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.920
 we put even if in the recipe 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.920
 original was not expected 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:43.290
 let's mix everything well see you in 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.530
 at this point we float the phase of 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.049
 work the rolling pin and the dough e 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.890
 we pull a sheet that is about thick 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.890
 an inch 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.170
 at this point cecilia cuts out the 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.810
 puff to get diamond shapes with 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.519
 these doses we will get about 60 70 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.049
 cookies 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.950
 light the oven at 180 degrees 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:11.379
 let's heat it up very well and then 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:15.480
 we inform our cookies that 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.480
 they must cook for about 10 minutes 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:23.319
 let 's cool we sprinkle there 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:29.560
 with a little icing sugar and I am 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:30.489
 ready gifts There are teachers there and 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:36.030
 we have to do 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:36.030
 eat good appetite and merry christmas
