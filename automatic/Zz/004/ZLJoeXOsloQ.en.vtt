that<00:00:23.029> wasn't<00:00:23.330> my<00:00:23.390> position<00:00:23.750> was<00:00:23.869> very

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050

dangerous but I didn't see any clear win

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.769 
dangerous but I didn't see any clear win
for<00:00:26.929> him<00:00:27.320> so<00:00:27.679> and<00:00:27.890> at<00:00:28.880> the<00:00:29.060> end<00:00:29.090> okay<00:00:29.269> so<00:00:29.630> that

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
for him so and at the end okay so that

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.080 
for him so and at the end okay so that
this<00:00:29.960> a<00:00:30.170> 5<00:00:30.410> was<00:00:30.800> probably<00:00:31.099> giving<00:00:31.400> me<00:00:31.550> draw<00:00:31.789> so

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
this a 5 was probably giving me draw so

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.230 
this a 5 was probably giving me draw so
in<00:00:32.480> the<00:00:32.630> opening<00:00:33.400> when<00:00:34.400> he<00:00:34.550> played<00:00:34.730> Bishop<00:00:35.060> g2

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:35.240 
in the opening when he played Bishop g2

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.880 
in the opening when he played Bishop g2
I<00:00:35.420> realized<00:00:35.870> that<00:00:35.930> last<00:00:36.200> time<00:00:36.440> i<00:00:36.470> looked<00:00:36.590> at

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
I realized that last time i looked at

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.710 
I realized that last time i looked at
the<00:00:36.920> position<00:00:37.490> was<00:00:37.850> maybe<00:00:38.060> three<00:00:38.330> years<00:00:38.480> ago

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
the position was maybe three years ago

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.260 
the position was maybe three years ago
and<00:00:39.050> of<00:00:39.170> course<00:00:39.410> it's<00:00:39.620> too<00:00:40.580> big<00:00:40.760> amount<00:00:41.060> of

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
and of course it's too big amount of

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.610 
and of course it's too big amount of
time<00:00:41.540> to<00:00:41.750> remember<00:00:42.250> the<00:00:43.250> details<00:00:43.430> and<00:00:44.620> rocky

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
time to remember the details and rocky

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.080 
time to remember the details and rocky
it<00:00:45.710> is<00:00:45.860> probably<00:00:46.160> the<00:00:46.280> worst<00:00:46.310> possible<00:00:46.700> move

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
it is probably the worst possible move

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.290 
it is probably the worst possible move
in<00:00:47.210> that<00:00:47.360> position<00:00:48.010> okay<00:00:49.010> so<00:00:49.070> so<00:00:49.850> nothing<00:00:49.970> to

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
in that position okay so so nothing to

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.140 
in that position okay so so nothing to
be<00:00:50.390> proud<00:00:50.420> of<00:00:50.660> the<00:00:50.960> opening<00:00:51.260> and<00:00:51.500> then<00:00:51.650> huge<00:00:52.490> my

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
be proud of the opening and then huge my

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.670 
be proud of the opening and then huge my
opening<00:00:53.450> mistake<00:00:53.750> very<00:00:53.990> well<00:00:54.170> he<00:00:54.320> got<00:00:54.470> some

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
opening mistake very well he got some

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.060 
opening mistake very well he got some
tragically<00:00:55.300> better<00:00:56.300> position<00:00:56.840> basically<00:00:57.410> he

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
tragically better position basically he

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.530 
tragically better position basically he
played<00:00:58.310> a<00:01:00.190> an<00:01:01.190> unnecessary<00:01:01.880> move<00:01:02.060> order<00:01:02.390> with

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
played a an unnecessary move order with

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
played a an unnecessary move order with
rupee<00:01:02.840> 8th<00:01:02.930> and<00:01:03.140> a<00:01:03.230> 6<00:01:03.550> which<00:01:04.550> I<00:01:04.730> anticipated

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
rupee 8th and a 6 which I anticipated

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.720 
rupee 8th and a 6 which I anticipated
because<00:01:06.560> you<00:01:06.830> know<00:01:06.950> in<00:01:07.550> this<00:01:08.380> well<00:01:09.380> I

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:09.730 
because you know in this well I

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.880 
because you know in this well I
anticipated<00:01:10.780> considering<00:01:11.780> how<00:01:11.990> how<00:01:12.500> bad<00:01:12.710> luck

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
anticipated considering how how bad luck

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.040 
anticipated considering how how bad luck
he<00:01:13.040> has<00:01:13.220> in<00:01:13.610> this<00:01:13.760> match<00:01:13.940> I<00:01:14.180> thought<00:01:14.660> it<00:01:14.900> would

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
he has in this match I thought it would

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.330 
he has in this match I thought it would
be<00:01:15.200> in<00:01:15.260> the<00:01:15.380> style<00:01:15.620> of<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:15.860> mesh<00:01:16.010> that<00:01:16.160> he

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
be in the style of the mesh that he

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.490 
be in the style of the mesh that he
would<00:01:16.460> again<00:01:16.700> have<00:01:16.760> bad<00:01:17.060> luck<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:17.390> make<00:01:18.350> the

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
would again have bad luck and make the

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.590 
would again have bad luck and make the
wrong<00:01:18.620> move<00:01:18.800> order<00:01:19.100> so<00:01:19.820> if<00:01:20.030> this<00:01:20.180> actually<00:01:20.330> was

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
wrong move order so if this actually was

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.970 
wrong move order so if this actually was
hoping<00:01:20.930> for<00:01:20.960> this<00:01:21.200> that<00:01:21.380> I<00:01:21.470> would<00:01:21.590> get<00:01:21.770> some

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
hoping for this that I would get some

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.580 
hoping for this that I would get some
tricks<00:01:22.430> like<00:01:22.580> 95<00:01:23.120> now<00:01:23.750> opening<00:01:24.020> one's<00:01:24.200> right<00:01:24.380> I

tricks like 95 now opening one's right I

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.800 
tricks like 95 now opening one's right I
cant<00:01:25.220> cannot<00:01:25.820> say<00:01:26.060> anything<00:01:26.240> because<00:01:26.450> I<00:01:26.570> had<00:01:26.780> a

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
very pleasant position just the thing is

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.390 
very pleasant position just the thing is
that<00:01:28.490> at<00:01:29.330> some<00:01:29.540> point<00:01:29.570> it<00:01:30.140> looked<00:01:30.350> looked<00:01:31.280> to

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
that at some point it looked looked to

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.640 
that at some point it looked looked to
me<00:01:31.520> better<00:01:31.730> than<00:01:31.880> it<00:01:32.000> actually<00:01:32.090> was<00:01:32.330> ant<00:01:32.720> and

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
me better than it actually was ant and

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.070 
me better than it actually was ant and
ok<00:01:33.860> then<00:01:34.040> I<00:01:34.159> was<00:01:34.610> bit<00:01:34.790> to<00:01:34.909> maximal<00:01:35.240> istic<00:01:35.510> then

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
ok then I was bit to maximal istic then

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.850 
ok then I was bit to maximal istic then
except<00:01:37.600> little<00:01:38.600> dogs<00:01:38.810> that<00:01:38.990> I<00:01:39.110> was<00:01:39.260> clearly

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
except little dogs that I was clearly

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.920 
except little dogs that I was clearly
worse<00:01:40.130> but<00:01:40.400> still<00:01:41.120> a<00:01:41.150> hope<00:01:41.420> that<00:01:41.450> there<00:01:41.720> is<00:01:41.810> no

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
worse but still a hope that there is no

worse but still a hope that there is no
force<00:01:42.170> to<00:01:42.320> win<00:01:42.440> for<00:01:42.650> him<00:01:42.860> and<00:01:43.100> unfortunately

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
force to win for him and unfortunately

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.960 
force to win for him and unfortunately
there<00:01:44.659> was<00:01:44.810> almost<00:01:45.050> for<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:45.950> first<00:01:46.250> win<00:01:46.490> for<00:01:46.550> him

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
there was almost for a first win for him

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.660 
there was almost for a first win for him
which<00:01:47.180> he<00:01:47.210> tried<00:01:47.600> to<00:01:48.100> show<00:01:49.100> in<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.460> game

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
which he tried to show in the game

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.180 
which he tried to show in the game
unfortunately<00:01:50.600> it<00:01:51.290> happened<00:01:51.710> to<00:01:51.800> be<00:01:51.920> false

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
unfortunately it happened to be false

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.820 
unfortunately it happened to be false
drawer<00:01:52.400> at<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.640> end<00:01:52.790> so<00:01:53.110> so<00:01:54.110> probably<00:01:54.470> he<00:01:54.530> had

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
drawer at the end so so probably he had

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.820 
drawer at the end so so probably he had
to<00:01:55.070> look<00:01:55.729> for<00:01:56.030> some<00:01:56.240> less<00:01:56.900> concrete<00:01:57.110> solutions

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
to look for some less concrete solutions

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.020 
to look for some less concrete solutions
and<00:01:58.010> he<00:01:58.130> would<00:01:58.220> problem<00:01:58.580> in<00:01:58.700> turn<00:01:58.850> his

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
and he would problem in turn his

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.390 
and he would problem in turn his
advantage<00:01:59.540> the<00:02:00.110> way<00:02:00.229> he<00:02:00.409> played<00:02:00.650> at<00:02:01.220> some

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
advantage the way he played at some

all his pieces that can jump I exchanged

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.109 
all his pieces that can jump I exchanged
all<00:02:06.799> the<00:02:06.920> pieces<00:02:07.100> that<00:02:07.220> can<00:02:07.430> give<00:02:07.610> me<00:02:07.729> checks<00:02:07.970> I

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
all the pieces that can give me checks I

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.400 
all the pieces that can give me checks I
exchanged<00:02:08.479> basically<00:02:08.840> all<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.110> pieces<00:02:09.289> that

I<00:02:09.590> want<00:02:09.740> to<00:02:09.770> exchange<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.280> it<00:02:11.150> was<00:02:11.330> about<00:02:11.510> to

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
I want to exchange and it was about to

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.670 
I want to exchange and it was about to
become

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
become

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.890 
become
very<00:02:13.189> very<00:02:13.459> bad<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:13.760> game<00:02:13.939> for<00:02:14.090> him<00:02:14.209> but<00:02:14.390> there

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
very very bad and game for him but there

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.229 
very very bad and game for him but there
was<00:02:15.019> suddenly<00:02:15.310> some<00:02:16.310> concrete<00:02:16.609> issues<00:02:16.849> that

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
was suddenly some concrete issues that

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.539 
was suddenly some concrete issues that
you<00:02:17.420> know<00:02:17.540> I<00:02:17.569> cannot<00:02:17.870> I<00:02:18.439> saw<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:19.099> coming<00:02:19.519> a

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
you know I cannot I saw it coming a

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.429 
you know I cannot I saw it coming a
little<00:02:19.760> bit<00:02:19.969> too<00:02:20.150> late<00:02:20.329> I<00:02:20.599> think<00:02:20.989> after<00:02:21.200> Queen

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:21.439 
little bit too late I think after Queen

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:24.069 
little bit too late I think after Queen
City<00:02:21.739> already<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.129> I<00:02:22.879> still<00:02:23.629> thought<00:02:23.840> that

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.079 
City already and I still thought that

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.679 
City already and I still thought that
there<00:02:24.290> should<00:02:24.409> be<00:02:24.530> something<00:02:24.709> from<00:02:25.069> me<00:02:25.219> I

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:25.689 
there should be something from me I

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:28.119 
there should be something from me I
first<00:02:26.689> wanted<00:02:27.260> to<00:02:27.379> make<00:02:27.500> sure<00:02:27.530> i'm<00:02:27.739> not<00:02:27.920> losing

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
first wanted to make sure i'm not losing

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.789 
first wanted to make sure i'm not losing
just<00:02:28.609> to<00:02:28.700> be<00:02:28.790> sure<00:02:28.819> I<00:02:29.540> saw<00:02:30.139> the<00:02:30.200> damage<00:02:30.500> music

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
just to be sure I saw the damage music

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.920 
just to be sure I saw the damage music
and<00:02:31.250> after<00:02:31.489> that<00:02:31.609> I<00:02:31.849> started<00:02:32.329> recalculating

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
and after that I started recalculating

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.280 
and after that I started recalculating
and<00:02:33.230> I<00:02:34.159> thought<00:02:34.549> I'm<00:02:34.849> probably<00:02:35.269> winning<00:02:36.049> the

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
and I thought I'm probably winning the

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.800 
and I thought I'm probably winning the
winning<00:02:37.040> upon<00:02:37.310> and<00:02:37.700> have<00:02:38.299> very<00:02:38.450> good<00:02:38.629> winning

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
winning upon and have very good winning

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.619 
winning upon and have very good winning
chances<00:02:39.219> but<00:02:40.219> then<00:02:40.400> I<00:02:40.849> realized<00:02:41.269> the<00:02:41.450> end<00:02:41.569> the

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 
chances but then I realized the end the

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.720 
chances but then I realized the end the
type<00:02:41.780> for<00:02:41.959> God's<00:02:42.139> that's<00:02:42.530> i<00:02:43.010> forgot<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:43.489> smoke

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
type for God's that's i forgot the smoke

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.399 
type for God's that's i forgot the smoke
windy<00:02:44.000> ate<00:02:44.090> when<00:02:44.840> I<00:02:44.900> was<00:02:44.930> cooperating<00:02:45.230> the

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
windy ate when I was cooperating the

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:46.479 
windy ate when I was cooperating the
push<00:02:45.530> in<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.650> second<00:02:46.010> time<00:02:46.099> because<00:02:46.250> I<00:02:46.370> saw

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
push in the second time because I saw

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.280 
push in the second time because I saw
the<00:02:46.549> first<00:02:46.819> time<00:02:46.970> I<00:02:47.000> saw<00:02:47.209> I<00:02:47.239> have<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.480> draw<00:02:47.720> but<00:02:48.230> I

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
the first time I saw I have a draw but I

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.899 
the first time I saw I have a draw but I
forgot<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:48.709> check<00:02:49.129> whether<00:02:49.310> that<00:02:49.549> wins<00:02:49.760> as

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:49.909 
forgot to check whether that wins as

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:51.940 
forgot to check whether that wins as
well<00:02:50.090> so<00:02:50.269> it<00:02:50.569> was<00:02:50.959> a<00:02:50.989> little<00:02:51.319> bit<00:02:51.530> unpleasant

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
well so it was a little bit unpleasant

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.250 
well so it was a little bit unpleasant
surprise<00:02:52.159> didn't<00:02:52.750> let<00:02:53.750> it<00:02:53.780> was<00:02:54.019> a<00:02:54.049> draw

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
surprise didn't let it was a draw

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.750 
surprise didn't let it was a draw
because<00:02:54.409> I<00:02:55.299> already<00:02:56.299> assumed<00:02:57.260> maybe<00:02:57.469> I'm

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
because I already assumed maybe I'm

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.729 
because I already assumed maybe I'm
maybe<00:02:58.760> I<00:02:58.879> calculated<00:02:59.389> got<00:03:00.200> a<00:03:00.230> little<00:03:00.379> better

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
maybe I calculated got a little better

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.830 
maybe I calculated got a little better
but<00:03:00.950> but<00:03:01.549> ok<00:03:01.730> here's<00:03:01.939> the<00:03:02.000> smoke<00:03:02.239> windy<00:03:02.510> agent

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
but but ok here's the smoke windy agent

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.280 
but but ok here's the smoke windy agent
I<00:03:03.219> have<00:03:04.219> a<00:03:04.879> draw<00:03:05.239> but<00:03:05.389> nothing<00:03:05.959> more<00:03:06.079> than<00:03:06.139> that

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
I have a draw but nothing more than that

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.069 
I have a draw but nothing more than that
you<00:03:06.439> you<00:03:06.889> analyzed<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:07.459> bit<00:03:07.609> the<00:03:08.209> board<00:03:08.450> which

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
you you analyzed a bit the board which

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.170 
you you analyzed a bit the board which
doesn't<00:03:09.650> happen<00:03:09.769> too<00:03:10.010> often<00:03:10.189> anymore<00:03:10.370> in<00:03:10.730> top

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
doesn't happen too often anymore in top

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.539 
doesn't happen too often anymore in top
Jason<00:03:11.569> aren't<00:03:11.900> you<00:03:12.019> really<00:03:12.530> curious<00:03:12.950> what<00:03:13.519> the

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
Jason aren't you really curious what the

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.459 
Jason aren't you really curious what the
computer<00:03:13.819> says<00:03:13.969> while<00:03:14.689> you<00:03:14.840> were<00:03:14.930> at<00:03:15.079> that<00:03:15.109> the

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:15.469 
computer says while you were at that the

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:21.520 
computer says while you were at that the
board<00:03:15.680> analyzing<00:03:16.159> oh<00:03:19.870> yeah<00:03:20.870> it's<00:03:21.019> hard<00:03:21.229> to<00:03:21.349> say

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
board analyzing oh yeah it's hard to say

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.189 
board analyzing oh yeah it's hard to say
because<00:03:21.760> once<00:03:22.760> you<00:03:23.060> consult<00:03:23.959> with<00:03:24.019> the

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:24.199 
because once you consult with the

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:26.110 
because once you consult with the
computer<00:03:24.620> then<00:03:24.829> it<00:03:24.949> makes<00:03:25.159> no<00:03:25.760> sense<00:03:25.790> to

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
computer then it makes no sense to

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.770 
computer then it makes no sense to
analyze<00:03:26.479> like<00:03:26.690> that<00:03:26.930> but<00:03:27.669> especially<00:03:28.669> for<00:03:29.209> me

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
analyze like that but especially for me

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.509 
analyze like that but especially for me
as<00:03:30.019> a<00:03:30.049> player<00:03:30.260> of<00:03:30.470> the<00:03:30.590> old<00:03:30.709> generation<00:03:31.220> of

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
as a player of the old generation of

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.050 
as a player of the old generation of
course<00:03:31.760> still<00:03:32.120> I'd<00:03:32.689> known<00:03:32.959> it<00:03:33.169> was<00:03:33.760> nice<00:03:34.760> to

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
course still I'd known it was nice to

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.089 
course still I'd known it was nice to
analyze<00:03:35.750> something<00:03:36.019> on<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:36.379> board<00:03:36.560> and<00:03:36.799> just

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
analyze something on the board and just

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.580 
analyze something on the board and just
try<00:03:37.849> to<00:03:37.879> work<00:03:38.150> with<00:03:38.180> your<00:03:38.449> own<00:03:38.629> brains<00:03:38.930> so<00:03:39.290> and

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
try to work with your own brains so and

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.849 
try to work with your own brains so and
ok<00:03:40.030> i'm<00:03:41.030> happy<00:03:41.299> that<00:03:41.509> i<00:03:41.989> just<00:03:42.349> get<00:03:42.560> although

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
ok i'm happy that i just get although

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.939 
ok i'm happy that i just get although
he's<00:03:43.159> from<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.579> new<00:03:43.699> generation<00:03:44.269> but<00:03:44.449> he<00:03:44.949> he

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:45.949 
he's from the new generation but he he

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.249 
he's from the new generation but he he
found<00:03:46.189> it<00:03:46.340> interesting<00:03:46.639> too<00:03:47.060> so<00:03:47.329> yeah<00:03:47.930> I<00:03:47.959> don't

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:48.259 
found it interesting too so yeah I don't

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:50.499 
found it interesting too so yeah I don't
know<00:03:48.349> actually<00:03:48.439> why<00:03:48.970> why<00:03:49.970> you<00:03:50.030> are<00:03:50.180> doing<00:03:50.209> it

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:50.509 
know actually why why you are doing it

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:53.800 
know actually why why you are doing it
basically<00:03:51.259> it's<00:03:51.590> much<00:03:51.829> more<00:03:52.689> much<00:03:53.689> more

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
basically it's much more much more

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.089 
basically it's much more much more
convenient<00:03:54.169> to<00:03:54.379> look<00:03:54.530> at<00:03:54.650> the<00:03:54.739> computer<00:03:55.040> and

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
convenient to look at the computer and

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:56.679 
convenient to look at the computer and
also<00:03:55.459> the<00:03:55.549> conclusion<00:03:55.970> is<00:03:56.120> much<00:03:56.359> more<00:03:56.540> quick

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:56.689 
also the conclusion is much more quick

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:59.050 
also the conclusion is much more quick
and<00:03:56.840> precise<00:03:57.109> but<00:03:57.489> ok<00:03:58.489> the<00:03:58.609> main<00:03:58.790> thing<00:03:59.030> is

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
and precise but ok the main thing is

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.929 
and precise but ok the main thing is
that<00:03:59.180> it's<00:04:00.019> not<00:04:00.199> your<00:04:00.709> you<00:04:01.370> know<00:04:01.459> you<00:04:01.519> used<00:04:01.790> to

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:01.939 
that it's not your you know you used to

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:04.360 
that it's not your you know you used to
look<00:04:02.090> for<00:04:02.299> truth<00:04:02.540> back<00:04:03.259> in<00:04:03.379> the<00:04:03.439> days<00:04:03.620> now<00:04:04.310> we

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
look for truth back in the days now we

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.240 
look for truth back in the days now we
are<00:04:04.819> just<00:04:05.419> trying<00:04:05.569> to<00:04:05.780> see<00:04:05.959> what<00:04:06.139> what<00:04:07.129> the

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
are just trying to see what what the

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.339 
are just trying to see what what the
other<00:04:07.370> one<00:04:07.519> so<00:04:07.989> because<00:04:08.989> that's<00:04:09.169> an

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
other one so because that's an

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:10.780 
other one so because that's an
interesting<00:04:09.739> thing<00:04:09.949> itself<00:04:10.310> you<00:04:10.489> know<00:04:10.519> what

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
interesting thing itself you know what

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.809 
interesting thing itself you know what
your<00:04:10.939> opponent's<00:04:11.359> thought<00:04:11.659> about<00:04:11.900> because

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
your opponent's thought about because

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.879 
your opponent's thought about because
you<00:04:13.819> know<00:04:13.939> he<00:04:14.120> was<00:04:14.239> also<00:04:14.389> sitting<00:04:14.599> there<00:04:14.889> not

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
you know he was also sitting there not

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.649 
you know he was also sitting there not
counting<00:04:16.340> flies<00:04:16.459> you<00:04:16.759> know<00:04:16.880> although<00:04:17.509> there

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:17.659 
counting flies you know although there

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:19.930 
counting flies you know although there
are<00:04:17.720> many<00:04:17.750> now<00:04:18.019> but<00:04:18.229> he<00:04:18.979> was<00:04:19.070> he<00:04:19.729> is<00:04:19.789> sitting

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
are many now but he was he is sitting

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.370 
are many now but he was he is sitting
there<00:04:20.209> he<00:04:20.389> is<00:04:20.449> working<00:04:20.630> hard<00:04:20.900> he's

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
there he is working hard he's

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.750 
there he is working hard he's
calculating<00:04:21.859> and<00:04:22.010> he's<00:04:22.099> a<00:04:22.130> great<00:04:22.370> calculator

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
calculating and he's a great calculator

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.960 
calculating and he's a great calculator
so<00:04:23.360> it<00:04:23.930> was<00:04:24.050> interesting<00:04:24.200> what<00:04:25.010> is<00:04:25.159> too

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
so it was interesting what is too

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.580 
so it was interesting what is too
to<00:04:26.030> see<00:04:26.180> what<00:04:26.270> what<00:04:26.540> he<00:04:26.660> saw<00:04:26.840> and<00:04:27.050> turn<00:04:27.320> and

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
to see what what he saw and turn and

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.340 
to see what what he saw and turn and
yeah<00:04:28.160> now<00:04:28.340> we'll<00:04:28.580> find<00:04:29.540> out<00:04:29.660> the<00:04:29.780> truth<00:04:29.990> once

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
yeah now we'll find out the truth once

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.370 
yeah now we'll find out the truth once
we<00:04:30.710> get<00:04:30.830> to<00:04:30.890> the<00:04:31.010> laptops
