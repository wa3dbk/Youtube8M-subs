00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
is dissolved it hasn't quite come to a

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.179 
is dissolved it hasn't quite come to a
boil<00:01:19.740> yet<00:01:20.780> but<00:01:21.780> once<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.140> comes<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.560> boil<00:01:22.830> I'm

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
boil yet but once it comes to a boil I'm

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.060 
boil yet but once it comes to a boil I'm
going<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.640> let<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.820> cook<00:01:24.500> and<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.619> can<00:01:25.770> do<00:01:25.920> that

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
going to let it cook and you can do that

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.740 
going to let it cook and you can do that
on<00:01:26.280> high<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:26.820> not<00:01:27.000> going<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.330> burn<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.720> can

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
on high it's not going to burn you can

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.120 
on high it's not going to burn you can
do<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.140> for<00:01:28.320> five<00:01:28.560> minutes

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
do that for five minutes

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.429 
do that for five minutes
and<00:01:29.689> then<00:01:30.689> we're<00:01:30.780> going<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.930> let<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.110> cool<00:01:31.380> down

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
and then we're going to let it cool down

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.620 
and then we're going to let it cool down
a<00:01:31.680> little<00:01:31.860> bit<00:01:32.189> before<00:01:32.400> we<00:01:32.610> add<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.119> extracts

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.810 

so<00:01:37.260> this<00:01:37.549> boiled<00:01:38.549> for<00:01:39.590> five<00:01:40.590> minutes<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.369> I

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
so this boiled for five minutes and I

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.310 
so this boiled for five minutes and I
let<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.119> cool<00:01:42.299> for<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.630> little<00:01:42.840> while

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
let it cool for a little while

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.300 
let it cool for a little while
and<00:01:44.189> then<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.790> want<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.060> put<00:01:45.270> vanilla<00:01:46.310> it's

I'm not processing this syrup I'm just
using<00:02:51.450> this<00:02:51.840> particular<00:02:52.910> glass<00:02:53.910> container

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
using this particular glass container

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.660 
using this particular glass container
because<00:02:54.750> it<00:02:54.870> holds<00:02:54.990> heat<00:02:55.380> very<00:02:55.620> well<00:02:55.740> so<00:02:56.490> this

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
because it holds heat very well so this

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.870 
because it holds heat very well so this
still<00:02:56.940> needs<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.420> be<00:02:57.570> refrigerated<00:02:58.820> okay<00:02:59.820> so

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
still needs to be refrigerated okay so

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.160 
still needs to be refrigerated okay so
now<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.240> just<00:03:00.330> want<00:03:00.600> to<00:03:00.660> go<00:03:00.750> ahead<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:00.990> pour

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
now you just want to go ahead and pour

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.680 
now you just want to go ahead and pour
gently<00:03:01.560> pour<00:03:01.770> that<00:03:01.950> in<00:03:02.160> carefully<00:03:02.760> very<00:03:03.390> hot

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
gently pour that in carefully very hot

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.730 
gently pour that in carefully very hot
syrup<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.550> it's<00:03:05.550> very<00:03:05.730> thin<00:03:06.030> looks<00:03:06.240> very<00:03:06.510> thin

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
syrup and it's very thin looks very thin

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.990 
syrup and it's very thin looks very thin
when<00:03:07.740> you<00:03:07.890> first<00:03:08.130> make<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.580> this<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.820> nice

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
when you first make and this is a nice

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.270 
when you first make and this is a nice
little<00:03:09.240> 2<00:03:09.510> cup<00:03:09.750> container<00:03:10.230> that's<00:03:10.680> just<00:03:11.010> about

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
little 2 cup container that's just about

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.230 
little 2 cup container that's just about
what<00:03:11.430> this<00:03:11.580> makes<00:03:12.530> and<00:03:13.530> then<00:03:14.400> I<00:03:14.430> take<00:03:14.760> my<00:03:14.790> lids

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
what this makes and then I take my lids

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.610 
what this makes and then I take my lids
and<00:03:15.480> I<00:03:15.510> just<00:03:15.750> go<00:03:15.840> ahead<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.080> close<00:03:16.260> it<00:03:16.290> but

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
and I just go ahead and close it but

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.310 
and I just go ahead and close it but
remember<00:03:17.190> this<00:03:17.490> is<00:03:17.670> not<00:03:17.790> processed<00:03:18.450> it<00:03:18.960> has<00:03:19.140> to

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
remember this is not processed it has to

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.040 
remember this is not processed it has to
go<00:03:19.470> into<00:03:19.710> the<00:03:19.890> refrigerator<00:03:20.450> so<00:03:21.450> beaker<00:03:21.870> and

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
go into the refrigerator so beaker and

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.340 
go into the refrigerator so beaker and
I'll<00:03:22.830> show<00:03:23.100> you<00:03:23.160> just<00:03:23.930> made<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:24.960> couple<00:03:25.200> of

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
I'll show you just made a couple of

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.730 
I'll show you just made a couple of
pancakes<00:03:25.920> for<00:03:26.190> us

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.490 

so<00:03:31.280> this<00:03:31.580> is<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:31.940> syrup<00:03:32.180> now<00:03:32.930> this<00:03:33.290> was

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
so this is the syrup now this was

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.100 
so this is the syrup now this was
refrigerated<00:03:34.220> overnight<00:03:34.310> and<00:03:34.970> so<00:03:35.270> you<00:03:35.930> see

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
refrigerated overnight and so you see

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.170 
refrigerated overnight and so you see
that<00:03:36.140> it's<00:03:36.710> pretty<00:03:36.980> mean<00:03:37.580> it's<00:03:37.700> not<00:03:37.790> very

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
that it's pretty mean it's not very

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.920 
that it's pretty mean it's not very
thick<00:03:38.480> but<00:03:38.540> it<00:03:38.780> has<00:03:38.900> a<00:03:38.930> nice<00:03:40.450> it<00:03:41.450> has<00:03:41.600> a<00:03:41.630> nice

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
thick but it has a nice it has a nice

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:48.640 
thick but it has a nice it has a nice
little<00:03:42.170> texture<00:03:42.770> to<00:03:42.800> it<00:03:44.050> okay<00:03:45.050> so<00:03:46.990> that<00:03:47.990> is<00:03:48.020> a

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
little texture to it okay so that is a

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.920 
little texture to it okay so that is a
it's<00:03:49.400> maple<00:03:49.580> service<00:03:50.120> not<00:03:50.300> real<00:03:50.540> maple<00:03:50.750> syrup

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
it's maple service not real maple syrup

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.170 
it's maple service not real maple syrup
it's<00:03:51.320> a<00:03:51.410> maple<00:03:51.620> syrup<00:03:51.800> extract<00:03:52.610> that<00:03:52.820> some

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
it's a maple syrup extract that some

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.260 
it's a maple syrup extract that some
actually<00:03:53.870> says<00:03:54.020> imitation<00:03:54.710> on<00:03:54.860> here<00:03:55.270> but

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
actually says imitation on here but

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.700 
actually says imitation on here but
that's<00:03:56.390> the<00:03:56.570> only<00:03:56.750> kind<00:03:56.930> that<00:03:57.170> you<00:03:57.290> really<00:03:57.530> can

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710
