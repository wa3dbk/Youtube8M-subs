00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.290
 Let's exercise a little 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.775
 on the subtraction of mixed numbers. 

00:00:02.775 --> 00:00:06.791
 Let's say I have 2 and 5/8 

00:00:06.791 --> 00:00:11.791
 minus 1 and 2/8. 

00:00:13.606 --> 00:00:15.788
 How much will it be? 

00:00:15.788 --> 00:00:16.984
 I recommend pausing the video 

00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:18.167
 and try to solve it. 

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:20.502
 Okay, we can write 

00:00:20.502 --> 00:00:21.663
 numbers on top of each other, 

00:00:21.663 --> 00:00:24.797
 we can say that this with the pink color is 2, 

00:00:24.797 --> 00:00:27.955
 let's say it's 2 and 5/8, 

00:00:27.955 --> 00:00:30.612
 actually let me write it a little longer, 

00:00:30.612 --> 00:00:33.976
 2 5/8, 

00:00:33.976 --> 00:00:38.492
 minus 1 and 2/8. 

00:00:39.403 --> 00:00:41.816
 And then we can get out. 

00:00:41.816 --> 00:00:43.531
 We can say, well, see, in this column 

00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:45.704
 Here we get the eighth. 

00:00:45.704 --> 00:00:47.887
 We have 5 eighths and will 

00:00:47.887 --> 00:00:49.047
 2 out of them. 

00:00:49.047 --> 00:00:50.208
 If I have 5 of something and I have to pull out 

00:00:50.208 --> 00:00:52.943
 2 of it, I will have 3 of this thing left, 

00:00:52.943 --> 00:00:54.144
 in this case we are talking about eighth. 

00:00:54.144 --> 00:00:55.583
 So, 5 eight minus 2 osmin 

00:00:55.583 --> 00:00:57.500
 will be 3 osmin, 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.137
 and then you have 2 units minus 1 unit 

00:01:00.137 --> 00:01:02.875
 or 2 minus 1, which will be 1. 

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:07.875
 This will be equal to 1 and 3/8. 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.216
 Now let's do something a little more interesting. 

00:01:10.216 --> 00:01:12.933
 Let's say I have 3, only yes 

00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:17.933
 invent a number here, 3 and 2/5 

00:01:18.993 --> 00:01:23.993
 minus 2 and 3/5. 

00:01:25.056 --> 00:01:28.202
 And as always, pause the video and try to solve it. 

00:01:28.202 --> 00:01:31.186
 Let's try to solve it just the same way. 

00:01:31.186 --> 00:01:33.657
 So I will write it like 3, 

00:01:33.657 --> 00:01:37.341
 let me write it with the same pink color, change the colors, 

00:01:37.341 --> 00:01:41.879
 we have 3 and 2 on 5 

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:46.879
 minus 2 and 3 on 5. 

00:01:48.056 --> 00:01:50.262
 2 and 3/5. 

00:01:50.262 --> 00:01:51.979
 And when you try to do it for the first time, 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.734
 here it was 5/8 minus 2/8, 

00:01:53.734 --> 00:01:56.384
 it was easy to find, it's 3/8. 

00:01:56.384 --> 00:02:00.209
 But then we have 2/5 minus 3/5. 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:01.346
 Ok, that's hard! 

00:02:01.346 --> 00:02:03.413
 3/5 is greater than 2/5. 

00:02:03.413 --> 00:02:05.410
 So what can you do here? 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.964
 Well, one option is to regroup. 

00:02:07.964 --> 00:02:10.343
 Let's take 1, I guess you can say 

00:02:10.343 --> 00:02:13.651
 the place of the units here, so let's get from here 1 

00:02:13.651 --> 00:02:15.811
 and then it will become 2. 

00:02:15.811 --> 00:02:18.795
 And then 1 is the same thing as 5/5. 

00:02:18.795 --> 00:02:23.694
 So 2 plus 5/5 is equal to 7/5. 

00:02:23.694 --> 00:02:25.436
 Another way to look at it, 

00:02:25.436 --> 00:02:28.861
 I will write it here, we can write, 

00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:32.932
 3 and 2/5 is the same as 2 and 7/5. 

00:02:32.932 --> 00:02:37.932
 2 and 7/5. These two are equivalent. 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.753
 Why? Well I took 1 from here to get 2 

00:02:41.753 --> 00:02:43.913
 and then I added 1 here. 

00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:46.236
 1 is the same as 5/5. 

00:02:46.236 --> 00:02:48.337
 2/5 plus 5/5 is 7/5. 

00:02:48.337 --> 00:02:53.050
 So now if we look at this as 2 and 7/5, 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.035
 we are ready to pull out. 

00:02:55.035 --> 00:03:00.035
 If you say 7/5 minus 3/5, 

00:03:00.201 --> 00:03:04.033
 this will be 4/5. 

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:06.120
 And then we have 2 minus 2 is 0 units, 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.581
 so you only stay with 4/5. 

00:03:08.581 --> 00:03:11.321
 So it will only be 4/5. 

00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:12.923
 Let's do that again. 

00:03:12.923 --> 00:03:14.816
 Let's solve a problem in which we will have to regroup again. 

00:03:14.816 --> 00:03:16.742
 And I will just write it in a column, 

00:03:16.742 --> 00:03:18.472
 top to bottom with which to start. 

00:03:18.472 --> 00:03:21.049
 Let's say we have 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:26.049
 7 and 1/6 minus 

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:32.117
 4 5/6. 

00:03:35.487 --> 00:03:37.714
 How will this be equal? 

00:03:37.714 --> 00:03:40.616
 Well when we try to draw 5/6 of 1/6, 

00:03:40.616 --> 00:03:43.158
 well, it's hard, 5/6 is bigger than 1/6. 

00:03:43.158 --> 00:03:44.656
 But we can regroup. 

00:03:44.656 --> 00:03:46.455
 We'll get 1 out of here, so 7 

00:03:46.455 --> 00:03:48.974
 will become 6. 

00:03:48.974 --> 00:03:51.238
 And then we take that 1 which is 

00:03:51.238 --> 00:03:54.292
 same as 6/6 and add it to 1/6. 

00:03:54.292 --> 00:03:59.292
 So 1/6 plus 6/6 will be 7/6. 

00:04:02.514 --> 00:04:03.793
 Let me know what I did. 

00:04:03.793 --> 00:04:06.370
 I took 1 of 7 and it became 6, 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.025
 and 1 is equal to 6/6, and so I added 

00:04:11.025 --> 00:04:13.963
 6/6 to this 1/6, and I received 7/6. 

00:04:13.963 --> 00:04:16.586
 I took 1 from here and added it here, 

00:04:16.586 --> 00:04:21.113
 and the purpose of this is that now 7/6 is greater than 5/6. 

00:04:21.733 --> 00:04:26.733
 7/6 minus 5/6 is, I will write it in orange, 

00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:29.956
 is 2/6, 

00:04:29.956 --> 00:04:34.246
 and 6 minus 4 is 2. 

00:04:34.404 --> 00:04:36.342
 This will be 2 and 2/6 or if we want to 

00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:39.988
 we write 2/6 in another way, we see that both are divided into 2, 

00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:44.545
 this is the same as 2 and 1/3 is equivalent to 2/6. 

00:04:44.545 --> 00:04:47.743
 So you can also write it this way.
