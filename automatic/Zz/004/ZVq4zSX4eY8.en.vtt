00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.350
 we have to talk about digital campaigns 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.230
 The first thing we have to remember is 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.390
 old spice and how I change the webb spice 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.340
 eng ny absolutely everything that came 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.860
 then in terms of media use in 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.170
 how much storytelling is happening 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.640
 in the middle that was a campaign that still 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.570
 to this day it is still pulling 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.610
 Mileage about the hallucinatory use of 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.920
 nonsense as a creative tool 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.260
 but from then on and assaulting 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.620
 several generations we have to get to 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.860
 things that impact as much as the wave 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.239
 type-r that is this great use they have 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.400
 of youtube as a tool 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.720
 storytelling in which they are counting on 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.309
 two parallel stories within a 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.680
 only product that this sector that is 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.540
 this car that can be in the morning a 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.520
 quiet and family car and at night 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.189
 a sports car, that's not amazing 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.540
 but already things that impact you and that 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.020
 you can see what are happening here 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.689
 We can see from Peru, not him 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.039
 2014 fahrenheit for mcdonald's is a 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.840
 incredible campaign that was level 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:25.819
 digital is that of play with me 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.710
 mcdonald's and it was this campaign where you 

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:29.299
 you were getting mcdonald's for the day 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.069
 of the child and instead of following a combo and 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.409
 pay it normally to this one of this 

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:34.670
 are going to play the junk aft and this more or 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.679
 less sets the tone for what the 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.240
 digital has to do this 2015 not 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:40.520
 you have to get into the digital as 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.920
 we are going to do post in social media or 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.780
 we're just going to make viral videos 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.849
 you have to start thinking that you can 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.560
 break the digital and that is interesting 

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:50.030
 so that people see outside and 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.530
 start playing a bit with this that 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.140
 many people call as activations 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.929
 digital or digital TV that is in 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.179
 actually think about the campaign not so much 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.310
 in terms of what medium is going to come out 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.929
 because support is going to have but in what 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.299
 we want to say and in what way we achieve 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.969
 better the impact does not and if we think about that 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:12.079
 let's see that for example the campaign 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:13.819
 of mcdonald's with compare to the plan plays 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:16.670
 with me or campaigns that have come 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.739
 later as the same campaign to whistle 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.840
 your mother have all the component of 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.609
 becoming viral is because they are things 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.840
 that people want to see us what 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:25.580
 we have also done 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.769
 part of my agency with skies guys from 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:33.140
 circus for lenovo with moviegoers and 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.780
 we converted to a product that was 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.370
 totally vigil and that people wanted 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.810
 see that he had the content 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.930
 interesting enough to be able 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.879
 be something click talk and enjoy in 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.010
 the first brand grandmother or the first 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:49.010
 mark of the first spot that became 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.049
 in a totally digital content and 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.540
 sponsored online he took the first 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:56.090
 online product as such properly 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.709
 said that if there are networks because it is 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.860
 interesting then the guideline has to 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.840
 be interesting and according to what it is 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.519
 interesting start your choosing your 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.620
 supports and give the best way to tell 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.049
 the story but if you're going to be thinking 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.760
 in that that has to be bike and this 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.640
 has to go in social and this has to 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.670
 go on youtube where you will get to 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.379
 campaigns that are going to be very good but 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.120
 that they will not contribute anything and 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.680
 matter if it is not digitally not 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.569
 matter if it is not clearly interactive 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.610
 the idea is to tell the story well and 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.150
 that is interesting and there we are going to be able 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.150
 build something
