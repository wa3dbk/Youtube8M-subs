have the same amount of armor so it's

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.500 
have the same amount of armor so it's
quite<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.260> lot<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.620> resources<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.370> upgrade<00:01:02.969> that

them<00:01:08.850> if<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.630> have<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> look<00:01:09.930> at<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.260> how<00:01:10.680> much

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
them if you have a look at the how much

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.969 
them if you have a look at the how much
resources<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.520> cost<00:01:11.900> you<00:01:12.900> notice<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:13.409> only

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
resources that cost you notice it's only

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.010 
resources that cost you notice it's only
seems<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.280> be<00:01:14.460> food<00:01:14.700> that's<00:01:15.540> because<00:01:15.840> one<00:01:15.990> of

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
seems to be food that's because one of

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.109 
seems to be food that's because one of
the<00:01:16.170> Spanish<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:17.450> bonuses<00:01:18.450> which<00:01:18.720> i<00:01:18.990> think<00:01:19.080> is

the Spanish is bonuses which i think is

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.429 
the Spanish is bonuses which i think is
probably<00:01:21.119> one<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.540> best<00:01:21.810> actually<00:01:22.049> out

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
probably one of the best actually out

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.420 
probably one of the best actually out
there<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:24.470> blacksmith<00:01:25.470> upgrades<00:01:25.860> only

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430

missionary they cost the same amount as

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.890 
missionary they cost the same amount as
a<00:02:33.420> monk<00:02:33.629> but<00:02:34.440> if<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.560> show<00:02:34.769> you<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.950> speed

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
a monk but if I show you the speed

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.199 
a monk but if I show you the speed
they're<00:02:36.900> much<00:02:37.290> faster<00:02:37.849> so<00:02:38.849> they're<00:02:39.000> brilliant

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
they're much faster so they're brilliant

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.050 
they're much faster so they're brilliant
to<00:02:39.510> get<00:02:39.690> into<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.049> enemy<00:02:40.410> that's<00:02:40.860> or<00:02:41.400> even<00:02:41.970> to

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
to get into the enemy that's or even to

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.210 
to get into the enemy that's or even to
the<00:02:42.150> ally<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.569> converting<00:02:43.470> or<00:02:43.709> heating<00:02:44.040> them

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
the ally and converting or heating them

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.750 
the ally and converting or heating them
however<00:02:45.060> they<00:02:45.390> can't<00:02:45.690> pick<00:02:45.959> up<00:02:46.049> relic<00:02:46.470> so<00:02:46.760> you

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
however they can't pick up relic so you

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.400 
however they can't pick up relic so you
can't<00:02:48.030> just<00:02:48.120> rely<00:02:48.510> on<00:02:48.540> getting<00:02:48.930> missionaries

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
can't just rely on getting missionaries

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.759 
can't just rely on getting missionaries
all<00:02:49.980> by<00:02:50.280> themselves<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:52.170> think<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.530> believe

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
all by themselves and I think I believe

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.800 
all by themselves and I think I believe
they<00:02:52.920> are<00:02:52.950> affected<00:02:53.730> as<00:02:53.849> well<00:02:53.880> by<00:02:54.299> all<00:02:54.329> of<00:02:54.569> the

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
they are affected as well by all of the

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.039 
they are affected as well by all of the
upgrade<00:02:55.319> so<00:02:56.250> they<00:02:56.400> seem<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:56.760> move<00:02:57.450> faster<00:02:57.930> with

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
upgrade so they seem to move faster with

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.360 
upgrade so they seem to move faster with
further<00:03:00.140> so<00:03:01.140> what<00:03:01.290> they<00:03:01.410> on<00:03:01.500> 30<00:03:01.799> hit<00:03:02.040> points

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
further so what they on 30 hit points

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:09.110 
further so what they on 30 hit points
yet<00:03:03.150> they<00:03:03.299> go<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.510> 45<00:03:04.110> with<00:03:04.440> sanctity<00:03:05.069> &amp;<00:03:07.940> +<00:03:08.940> 3

yet they go to 45 with sanctity &amp; + 3
conversion<00:03:09.510> rent<00:03:09.660> yet<00:03:09.840> they<00:03:10.049> go<00:03:10.079> from<00:03:10.319> seven

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
conversion rent yet they go from seven

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.949 
conversion rent yet they go from seven
to<00:03:10.829> 10<00:03:11.280> which<00:03:11.549> is<00:03:11.579> quite<00:03:11.910> useful<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:14.959> now

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
to 10 which is quite useful and now

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.430 
to 10 which is quite useful and now
that's<00:03:16.470> really<00:03:16.709> all<00:03:17.069> I<00:03:17.099> can<00:03:17.310> do<00:03:17.430> about<00:03:17.670> that

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
that's really all I can do about that

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.199 
that's really all I can do about that
the<00:03:19.440> unit<00:03:19.739> technology<00:03:20.310> for<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:20.609> thousands<00:03:21.060> is

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
the unit technology for the thousands is

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.059 
the unit technology for the thousands is
called<00:03:22.170> supremacy<00:03:22.950> and<00:03:24.410> it's<00:03:25.410> an<00:03:25.530> unusual<00:03:25.650> one

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
called supremacy and it's an unusual one

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.729 
called supremacy and it's an unusual one
because<00:03:26.329> it<00:03:27.329> focuses<00:03:27.480> on<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.139> villager<00:03:28.530> as

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
because it focuses on the villager as

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:34.819 
because it focuses on the villager as
opposed<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:30.200> some<00:03:31.200> form<00:03:31.470> of<00:03:32.480> military<00:03:33.709> but<00:03:34.709> it

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
opposed to some form of military but it

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.830 
opposed to some form of military but it
focuses<00:03:34.980> on<00:03:35.370> getting<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:35.790> villager<00:03:36.209> to<00:03:36.420> be<00:03:36.599> a

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
focuses on getting the villager to be a

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.860 
focuses on getting the villager to be a
military<00:03:37.410> unit<00:03:37.950> so<00:03:38.670> you<00:03:38.730> can<00:03:38.880> see<00:03:39.030> here<00:03:39.269> 40<00:03:39.720> hit

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
military unit so you can see here 40 hit

military unit so you can see here 40 hit
points<00:03:40.230> 3<00:03:41.160> attack<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:44.150> silly<00:03:45.150> helicopter<00:03:45.630> I

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.420 
points 3 attack and silly helicopter I
will<00:03:46.049> just

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
will just

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.730 
will just

stop and I close my window to avoid that
noise<00:03:50.890> so<00:03:51.670> do<00:03:51.730> a<00:03:51.790> Supremacy<00:03:52.920> 48.3<00:03:53.920> attack<00:03:54.310> and

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
noise so do a Supremacy 48.3 attack and

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.000 
noise so do a Supremacy 48.3 attack and

then do to loom which you most likely

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.500 
then do to loom which you most likely

will get in the dark age or at least a
few<00:03:58.660> delays<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.800> I<00:03:59.920> was<00:04:00.040> a<00:04:00.070> villager<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.550> have

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
few delays and I was a villager to have

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.340 
few delays and I was a villager to have
12<00:04:01.180> armor<00:04:02.400> so<00:04:03.400> supremacy<00:04:04.030> cost<00:04:04.570> 400<00:04:05.020> food<00:04:05.170> and

250 gold now that's actually very good

speed<00:06:07.440> for<00:06:08.100> building<00:06:08.690> but<00:06:09.690> Spanish<00:06:10.020> can't<00:06:10.230> get

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.410 
speed for building but Spanish can't get

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:11.720

for<00:06:21.270> the<00:06:21.300> Spanish<00:06:21.900> is<00:06:22.940> another<00:06:23.940> really<00:06:24.270> good

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
for the Spanish is another really good

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.050 
for the Spanish is another really good
one<00:06:24.570> actually<00:06:24.920> so<00:06:25.920> not<00:06:26.250> only<00:06:26.280> do<00:06:26.580> the

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
one actually so not only do the

one actually so not only do the
blacksmith<00:06:27.450> upgrades<00:06:27.870> don't<00:06:28.170> cost<00:06:28.410> gold<00:06:28.740> they

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
blacksmith upgrades don't cost gold they

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:34.550 
blacksmith upgrades don't cost gold they
have<00:06:30.540> this<00:06:30.660> one<00:06:30.900> which<00:06:31.140> is<00:06:32.840> that<00:06:33.840> their<00:06:34.200> cannon

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
have this one which is that their cannon

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.100 
have this one which is that their cannon
galleons<00:06:35.030> fire<00:06:36.030> faster<00:06:36.720> they<00:06:37.160> benefit<00:06:38.160> from

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.110 
galleons fire faster they benefit from

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:44.360 
galleons fire faster they benefit from
ballistics<00:06:40.130> so<00:06:41.360> if<00:06:42.360> I<00:06:42.510> were<00:06:42.810> to<00:06:43.250> create<00:06:44.250> a

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.370 
ballistics so if I were to create a

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:49.430 
ballistics so if I were to create a
university<00:06:45.090> and<00:06:45.710> i<00:06:47.000> can't<00:06:48.000> get<00:06:48.440> canon

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 
university and i can't get canon

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.540 
university and i can't get canon
guardians<00:06:49.680> at<00:06:49.800> moment<00:06:50.070> so<00:06:50.190> if<00:06:50.280> i<00:06:50.370> get

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550 
guardians at moment so if i get

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.460 
guardians at moment so if i get
chemistry<00:06:51.060> i<00:06:51.270> can<00:06:51.810> now<00:06:51.900> get<00:06:52.080> the<00:06:52.170> cannon

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:52.470 
chemistry i can now get the cannon

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:55.250 
chemistry i can now get the cannon
gallium<00:06:52.830> and<00:06:53.460> let's<00:06:54.210> just<00:06:54.360> get<00:06:54.510> the<00:06:54.720> elite

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:55.260 
gallium and let's just get the elite

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.960 
gallium and let's just get the elite
clan<00:06:55.440> in<00:06:55.560> gallium<00:06:57.200> now<00:06:58.220> you<00:06:59.220> can<00:06:59.340> see<00:06:59.520> there<00:06:59.760> he

00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.970 
clan in gallium now you can see there he

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:06.050 
clan in gallium now you can see there he
fired<00:07:00.240> much<00:07:00.720> faster<00:07:01.230> and<00:07:04.580> this<00:07:05.580> how<00:07:05.790> great

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.060

yet<00:07:10.850> you<00:07:11.850> can<00:07:12.000> see<00:07:12.180> in<00:07:12.570> spying<00:07:12.900> much<00:07:13.260> faster

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 
yet you can see in spying much faster

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.630 
yet you can see in spying much faster
and<00:07:14.210> if<00:07:15.210> i<00:07:15.360> were<00:07:15.540> to<00:07:15.720> get<00:07:15.900> ballistics<00:07:16.560> he<00:07:17.370> fires

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:17.640 
and if i were to get ballistics he fires

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.920 
and if i were to get ballistics he fires
even<00:07:18.120> faster<00:07:18.630> and<00:07:18.900> it's<00:07:19.230> much<00:07:19.500> more<00:07:19.770> accurate

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:20.930 
even faster and it's much more accurate

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.590 
even faster and it's much more accurate
so<00:07:22.520> they're<00:07:23.520> very<00:07:23.550> useful<00:07:24.060> that<00:07:24.240> it's<00:07:24.450> almost

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:24.600 
so they're very useful that it's almost

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.100 
so they're very useful that it's almost
like<00:07:24.840> a<00:07:24.870> long<00:07:25.230> ranged<00:07:25.770> turtle<00:07:26.490> ship<00:07:26.930> so<00:07:27.930> that's

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:28.110 
like a long ranged turtle ship so that's

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.980 
like a long ranged turtle ship so that's
quite<00:07:28.410> useful<00:07:28.860> indeed<00:07:29.510> those<00:07:30.510> are<00:07:30.660> all<00:07:30.750> the

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:30.990 
quite useful indeed those are all the

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.760 
quite useful indeed those are all the
upgrades<00:07:31.260> for<00:07:31.770> the<00:07:31.830> spanish<00:07:33.500> think<00:07:34.500> very<00:07:34.680> much

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:34.770 
upgrades for the spanish think very much

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.440
