00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
also has the longest range of the three

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.779 
also has the longest range of the three
usually<00:04:47.900> good<00:04:48.139> for<00:04:48.440> the<00:04:48.710> first<00:04:48.860> shot<00:04:49.130> and<00:04:49.460> if

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:49.789 
usually good for the first shot and if

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.090 
usually good for the first shot and if
the<00:04:49.910> enemy<00:04:50.060> ship<00:04:50.419> is<00:04:50.570> trying<00:04:50.840> to<00:04:50.960> flee<00:04:51.169> the

the enemy ship is trying to flee the
chain<00:04:52.370> shot<00:04:52.699> which<00:04:52.940> does<00:04:53.240> damage<00:04:53.660> to<00:04:53.870> the<00:04:53.960> sail

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
chain shot which does damage to the sail

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:56.500 
chain shot which does damage to the sail
which<00:04:54.470> affects<00:04:54.860> the<00:04:55.070> ship<00:04:55.310> speed<00:04:55.639> probably

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
which affects the ship speed probably

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.270 
which affects the ship speed probably
the<00:04:56.690> best<00:04:56.960> shot<00:04:57.199> of<00:04:57.380> the<00:04:57.500> three<00:04:57.770> because

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
the best shot of the three because

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.550 
the best shot of the three because
reducing<00:04:59.030> the<00:04:59.150> enemy's<00:04:59.510> speed<00:04:59.870> makes<00:05:00.229> things

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
reducing the enemy's speed makes things

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.439 
reducing the enemy's speed makes things
a<00:05:00.680> lot<00:05:00.860> easier<00:05:01.130> especially<00:05:01.580> if<00:05:02.090> they're<00:05:02.419> a

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
a lot easier especially if they're a

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:04.659 
a lot easier especially if they're a
boarding<00:05:03.080> party<00:05:03.260> rather<00:05:03.680> than<00:05:03.889> a<00:05:04.130> warship

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
boarding party rather than a warship

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.790 
boarding party rather than a warship
then<00:05:05.090> there<00:05:05.360> is<00:05:05.479> the<00:05:05.630> grapeshot<00:05:05.900> which<00:05:06.500> mainly

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
then there is the grapeshot which mainly

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.040 
then there is the grapeshot which mainly
kills<00:05:07.250> a<00:05:07.430> lot<00:05:07.490> of<00:05:07.940> crew<00:05:08.210> on<00:05:08.479> the<00:05:08.630> other<00:05:08.750> ship

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
kills a lot of crew on the other ship

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.290 
kills a lot of crew on the other ship
this<00:05:09.590> is<00:05:09.770> also<00:05:09.949> good<00:05:10.400> to<00:05:10.430> slow<00:05:10.820> down<00:05:11.000> the

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
this is also good to slow down the

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.240 
this is also good to slow down the
reloading<00:05:11.660> time<00:05:11.780> of<00:05:12.229> enemy<00:05:12.620> ship<00:05:12.860> cannons

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
reloading time of enemy ship cannons

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.820 
reloading time of enemy ship cannons
also<00:05:14.210> there<00:05:14.419> can<00:05:14.570> be<00:05:14.630> situations<00:05:15.380> where<00:05:15.710> you

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
also there can be situations where you

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.920 
also there can be situations where you
would<00:05:15.949> attack<00:05:16.400> a<00:05:16.430> ship<00:05:16.580> and<00:05:17.000> its<00:05:17.210> escort<00:05:17.660> where

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
would attack a ship and its escort where

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.200 
would attack a ship and its escort where
there<00:05:18.860> will<00:05:19.010> be<00:05:19.070> two<00:05:19.370> ships<00:05:19.610> attacking<00:05:20.090> you

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
there will be two ships attacking you

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.900 
there will be two ships attacking you
