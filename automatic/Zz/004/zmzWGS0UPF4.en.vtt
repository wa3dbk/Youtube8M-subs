00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
live 09 hustle plays were pretty much

floor guys just kind of watched the

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.240 
floor guys just kind of watched the
water<00:00:24.750> balance<00:00:25.109> or<00:00:25.230> just<00:00:25.380> watched<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.800> sit<00:00:26.220> on

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
the floor in NBA live 10 it's something

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.019 
the floor in NBA live 10 it's something
we<00:00:28.529> really<00:00:28.650> wanted<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.039> have<00:00:29.189> in<00:00:29.339> the<00:00:29.400> game<00:00:29.580> now

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
we really wanted to have in the game now

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.519 
we really wanted to have in the game now
whenever<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.390> ball<00:00:30.539> gets<00:00:30.689> loose<00:00:30.929> there's<00:00:31.439> a

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
whenever the ball gets loose there's a

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.640 
whenever the ball gets loose there's a
steal<00:00:32.040> or<00:00:32.070> collision<00:00:32.550> guys<00:00:33.330> will<00:00:33.750> hustle<00:00:34.320> hard

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
steal or collision guys will hustle hard

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.380 
steal or collision guys will hustle hard
after<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.980> ball<00:00:35.160> they'll<00:00:35.340> scramble<00:00:35.700> they'll

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
after the ball they'll scramble they'll

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.290 
after the ball they'll scramble they'll
dive<00:00:36.899> hit<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.289> floor<00:00:37.530> for<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.800> loose<00:00:38.010> ball<00:00:38.300> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
dive hit the floor for a loose ball the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.520 
dive hit the floor for a loose ball the
balls<00:00:39.450> had<00:00:39.660> not<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.809> balance<00:00:40.200> will<00:00:40.320> die<00:00:40.469> for

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
balls had not a balance will die for

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.290 
balls had not a balance will die for
that<00:00:40.710> save<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.460> bounce<00:00:41.610> back<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.180> their

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
that save it and bounce back to their

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.150 
that save it and bounce back to their
teammates<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.930> what<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.800> does<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.039> it

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
teammates and what that does is it

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160 
teammates and what that does is it
really<00:00:44.460> allows<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.329> game<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.539> flow<00:00:46.110> more

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
really allows the game to flow more

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.529 
really allows the game to flow more
naturally<00:00:46.770> leads<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.850> lot<00:00:47.969> more<00:00:48.030> exciting

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
naturally leads to a lot more exciting

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.700 
naturally leads to a lot more exciting
place<00:00:48.719> because<00:00:48.930> at<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.140> end<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.320> those<00:00:49.410> hustle

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
place because at the end of those hustle

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.349 
place because at the end of those hustle
players<00:00:49.920> usually<00:00:50.190> get<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> nice<00:00:50.730> fast<00:00:51.000> break

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:51.359 
players usually get a nice fast break

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:53.240 
players usually get a nice fast break
and<00:00:51.390> at<00:00:52.109> least<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.440> nice<00:00:52.590> dunk<00:00:52.859> or<00:00:53.039> something

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
and at least to a nice dunk or something

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.400 
and at least to a nice dunk or something
like<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.789> we<00:00:54.660> feel<00:00:54.840> it's<00:00:54.930> really<00:00:55.170> strong

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
like that so we feel it's really strong

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.970 
like that so we feel it's really strong
aspect<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.160> game<00:00:56.190> play<00:00:56.519> like<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:56.969> year

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.390 

in<00:01:01.550> NBA<00:01:01.790> live<00:01:01.970> 09<00:01:02.110> dribble<00:01:03.110> moves<00:01:03.260> were<00:01:03.530> kind

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
in NBA live 09 dribble moves were kind

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.070 
in NBA live 09 dribble moves were kind
of<00:01:04.489> stagnant<00:01:04.790> a<00:01:05.030> little<00:01:05.210> bit<00:01:05.300> robotic<00:01:05.630> but<00:01:05.990> in

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
of stagnant a little bit robotic but in

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.140 
of stagnant a little bit robotic but in
NBA<00:01:06.350> live<00:01:06.530> 10<00:01:06.560> juba<00:01:07.250> moves<00:01:07.460> were<00:01:07.610> a<00:01:07.850> huge

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
NBA live 10 juba moves were a huge

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.880 
NBA live 10 juba moves were a huge
priority<00:01:08.360> for<00:01:08.659> us<00:01:08.870> and<00:01:09.170> we<00:01:09.470> introduced<00:01:09.800> this

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
priority for us and we introduced this

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.100 
priority for us and we introduced this
concept<00:01:09.979> called<00:01:10.490> size<00:01:10.970> ups<00:01:11.240> which<00:01:11.510> is<00:01:12.050> a

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
concept called size ups which is a

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.480 
concept called size ups which is a
really<00:01:12.290> simple<00:01:12.590> mechanic<00:01:12.979> you<00:01:13.070> just<00:01:13.220> hold<00:01:13.340> on

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
really simple mechanic you just hold on

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.130 
really simple mechanic you just hold on
a<00:01:13.520> button<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.030> your<00:01:14.479> players<00:01:14.690> will<00:01:14.900> start<00:01:15.080> to

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
a button and your players will start to

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.200 
a button and your players will start to
do<00:01:15.229> this<00:01:15.380> really<00:01:15.680> nice<00:01:15.830> in<00:01:16.400> place<00:01:16.820> dribble

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
do this really nice in place dribble

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.150 
do this really nice in place dribble
moves<00:01:17.330> that<00:01:17.690> will<00:01:17.900> kind<00:01:18.200> of<00:01:18.259> set<00:01:18.890> up<00:01:19.009> your

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
moves that will kind of set up your

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.890 
moves that will kind of set up your
defender<00:01:19.580> to<00:01:19.759> take<00:01:20.150> him<00:01:20.270> off<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:20.479> dribble<00:01:20.509> and

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
defender to take him off the dribble and

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.450 
defender to take him off the dribble and
one<00:01:21.290> of<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.410> great<00:01:21.560> things<00:01:21.800> about<00:01:21.890> the<00:01:22.250> size

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
one of the great things about the size

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.550 
one of the great things about the size
of<00:01:22.580> mechanic<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:23.479> size<00:01:23.720> of<00:01:23.869> animation<00:01:24.350> so

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
of mechanic and the size of animation so

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.530 
of mechanic and the size of animation so
that<00:01:24.740> we<00:01:25.369> really<00:01:25.400> differentiate<00:01:26.150> between<00:01:26.270> the

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
that we really differentiate between the

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.719 
that we really differentiate between the
different<00:01:26.930> players<00:01:27.170> so<00:01:27.560> LeBron<00:01:28.100> James<00:01:28.490> who

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
different players so LeBron James who

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.430 
different players so LeBron James who
likes<00:01:28.910> to<00:01:29.060> do<00:01:29.180> kind<00:01:29.720> of<00:01:29.750> that<00:01:29.900> bouncing

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
likes to do kind of that bouncing

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.620 
likes to do kind of that bouncing
seismic<00:01:30.950> triple<00:01:31.190> that<00:01:31.280> he<00:01:31.369> has<00:01:31.550> and<00:01:31.880> then<00:01:32.479> the

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
seismic triple that he has and then the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.760 
seismic triple that he has and then the
other<00:01:32.659> end<00:01:32.900> of<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:33.020> spectrum<00:01:33.140> you<00:01:33.530> have<00:01:33.560> your

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
other end of the spectrum you have your

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.710 
other end of the spectrum you have your
bigs<00:01:33.979> who<00:01:34.280> don't<00:01:34.820> have<00:01:34.940> the<00:01:35.090> best<00:01:35.240> handle<00:01:35.570> some

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
bigs who don't have the best handle some

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.749 
bigs who don't have the best handle some
time<00:01:35.930> so<00:01:36.200> that<00:01:36.380> it's<00:01:36.710> a<00:01:36.800> lot<00:01:36.979> more<00:01:37.009> simple<00:01:37.520> just

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
time so that it's a lot more simple just

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.240 
time so that it's a lot more simple just
slower<00:01:37.970> crossovers<00:01:38.690> but<00:01:39.649> they<00:01:39.740> really<00:01:39.920> start

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
slower crossovers but they really start

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.920
