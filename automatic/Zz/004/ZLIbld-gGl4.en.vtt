00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:39.149
 It was again the smaller ducks like Anton 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.989
 Schlecker Qantas the year over 80 percent grow what the vacant lots as 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:50.289
 only region Northern Hesse Greta today we have a lot of air in the hotel 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:56.220
 on the navigation system he probably does not chew we're getting ready now 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.219
 time again 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.470
 Philip of Sweden is raising the voice wanted 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.880
 Airplanes are among the most fascinating means of transport 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.440
 all obstacles are easily overcome 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.750
 also mountains deserts or oceans 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.780
 they are faster than cars trains and ships 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.670
 There are many different models of aircraft that you can use in the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.130
 Air can go 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.430
 for example, with gliders 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.310
 they do not have engines being blown up and gliding similarly 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.310
 Birds silently through the air 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.820
 Creating propeller aircraft, however, is of its own accord in the sky 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.950
 soar 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:39.840
 all 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.250
 so far sat with Martin Braun the speed of the striker 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:53.780
 then there are the passenger machines they are among the biggest and biggest 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.050
 heaviest aircraft experiences heavy colossi with the help of 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.790
 States engines 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.250
 leave above 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.610
 These aircraft can accommodate several hundred people 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.270
 also small or large machines 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.959
 whether with or without engine 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.219
 they all have one thing in common 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:15.749
 they need a 4 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:18.859
 flying for the machine 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:20.259
 this is Oliver w 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:23.259
 he is a pilot by profession and like big passenger planes 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.749
 Here he is on the way to his machine to meet his customers 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.219
 His colleagues include the stewardesses and stewards 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:35.999
 the passengers can 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.149
 without the copilot 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:41.149
 who supports flying in Bern 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.870
 Oliver wants and his team prepare everything for the planned 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.870
 Launch of the passenger plane in front 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.879
 while today we were traveling by plane quite normal 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.939
 For thousands of years this has been an unfulfilled dream for mankind 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.150
 leave the EU and float free as a bird through the air 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.090
 People were already standing back from this fascinating ability 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.739
 Borken in the course of history, inventors tried again and again aircraft 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:22.330
 to build 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.119
 with which they could rise in the air 

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:26.410
 it takes a long time 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.630
 It finally succeeded
