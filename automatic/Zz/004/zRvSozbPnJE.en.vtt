00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.230
 hi to all I am nicola ii gas e 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.760
 today is Friday, March 14, 2014 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.679
 finally it's sunny but this one doesn't have 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.969
 nothing to do with the next two 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.969
 minutes with android world 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.900
 google and lg smartwatch you do 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.120
 he will be more and more concrete 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.310
 first flag bearer of this type of 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.530
 devices 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.680
 so far there has been talk of a display from 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:35.870
 1.65 inches with 280 by 280 resolution 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.320
 pixel while the processor remains longer 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.900
 uncertain the ram should be 512 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.559
 megabytes while the internal memory of 4 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.660
 gigabyte 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.340
 but the most interesting thing that google 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.500
 announced that it will shortly be 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.930
 an SDK for devices is available 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.970
 wearables will really be the spring 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.610
 which will serve to push this kind of 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.550
 device one plus one a wright access 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.500
 control just like moto hicks or i 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.870
 voice checks even when the screen is off 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.879
 thanks to a particular function of the 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.830
 snapdragon 800 on which so far 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.240
 strangely no one had decided to 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.010
 bet 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.290
 the new feature will be possible thanks to 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.630
 cyanogenmod which will precede on purpose 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.370
 of the smartphone software and that though 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.990
 it is not known if he will be able to bring this 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.540
 functionality also on all the others 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.939
 devices equipped with snapdragon 800 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.049
 obviously this is what everyone hopes 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.049
 the community of android users 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.759
 you know you've reached the Olympus of the 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.890
 leaks when yours 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.990
 smartphone not yet announced goes into 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.020
 sale on ebay for $ 500 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.270
 that's what happened to htc all in 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.189
 one or whatever will be his 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.799
 real name that was beaten on 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:50.299
 famous auction site for $ 499.99 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.250
 a figure all in all that we hope 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.109
 to be able to pay also at the time of 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.960
 its put on sale even if much 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:59.420
 it will hardly be so contained in 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.979
 normal conditions the data on the micro sd 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.299
 they are not exposed 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.369
 however if the owner of the 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.880
 device downloads a malware or a 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.609
 virus 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.259
 the phone will be at risk this is the 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:11.030
 whatsapp response to recent 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.730
 safety criticism 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.730
 as we say we leave the front door 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.210
 open if someone then comes in to steal the 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.210
 it's not our fault 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.330
 then pardoned senses
