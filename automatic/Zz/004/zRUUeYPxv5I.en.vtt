00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.160
It’s great fun to play in a courtyard.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.800
But, have you ever seen cats fighting there?

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.560
There was once a town named Sundarpur.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.820
This town had a house with a courtyard where once, a cake was lying.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.600
A cat saw it. She went running to eat the cake.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The first Cat: “Whow! What a feast I shall have today. Hmm….a good spongy cake to eat!”

00:00:41.085 --> 00:00:43.700

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.400
But suddenly, another cat also came there.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:56.640
The second Cat: “Meow, meow! This is my cake, I’ll eat it!!”

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:06.000
The first Cat: “I came here first. Go away from here! Only I will eat this entire cake!!

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.560
Both the cats began fighting to eat the cake.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.000
Both of them starting shouting and fighting with each other.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.020
A monkey was sitting nearby.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.820
He was amused watching the two cats fight with each other.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:51.940
The Monkey said: “First of all, both of you, stop fighting with each other and give me the cake.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.900
I’ll divide it equally in two portions and give one to both of you.”

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.480
Saying that, the monkey divided the cake into two portions.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.160
And he kept them on the two sides of the weighing-scale and started weighing.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.000
As he weighed the two portions, one side of the weighing-scale went down.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:29.960
The Monkey: “Hmm.. it seems this piece of cake is slightly bigger than the other one. Let me make it smaller”

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.040
So the monkey cut off a piece from the bigger portion and ate it.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.600
After weighing again, the other side of the weighing-scale went down.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.960
Even this time, both the sides were not equal.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:51.300
To make both portions of the cake equal,  he start having a bite from each portion.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:03:00.940
Thus, eating the cake from both sides to make them equal, the monkey ended up eating the whole cake.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.020
Seeing this, both the cats looked at each other in disappointment.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.620
They felt very sad and went away from there.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:20.160
SO CHILDREN, WHEN TWO PEOPLE FIGHT, THE THIRD ONE ALWAYS TAKES THE ADVANTAGE OF IT AND WINS

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.600
THAT’S WHY WE SHOULD NOT FIGHT AMONGST EACH OTHER.
