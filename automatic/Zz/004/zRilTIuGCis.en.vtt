 this with you is just a summer romance 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.050
 It is not the true love in the serious 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.710

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.510

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:47.339
 Nothing about my father has anything to do with you 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.949

 but your mother was never taken that 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.079
 my first love was absolutely 

00:00:57.209 --> 00:01:03.049
 incredibly pretty girl with so much 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.729
 You can forget about coal 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:08.450
 In the last two years she has only 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.450

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.750
 Behavior you have never asked why 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.960
