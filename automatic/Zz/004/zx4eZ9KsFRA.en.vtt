00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.730
 very good morning today we are going to 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.959
 Make a bow of two colors similar to 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.629
 that we did the previous tutorial 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:16.299
 use a paper tape in this case 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:18.699
 much thinner on average 50 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.800
 centimeters then we use the tape of 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.660
 red paper and white paper ribbon 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.400
 which are a little wider and 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.119
 usually they should not miss 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.220
 scissors 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.519
 we start first we take out the roll of 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.020
 the red paper tape we stretch it 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.350
 larguita to be able to work better 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.750
 we do the same with the white roll 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.690
 we try after to join them already 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.670
 put the two strips together and try to 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.860
 they are the same size 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.140
 we put the two ends together as you see it here 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.290
 perfect remember that this monkey 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.240
 usually goes 10 laps but as 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.860
 they are two colors then we are going to live 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.990
 the 10 laps in the two colors 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.080
 in this case then we would only give 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.210
 five laps we will do the same thing that 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.640
 in the previous tutorial we got to the 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.320
 main point the two points 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.660
 principals are going to go down with 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.810
 others with the four fingers we fight and 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:16.140
 We keep the size of the bow then 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.800
 in this position we are going to start 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.800
 we take 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.330
 we take a turn 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.869
 we give the other turn 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.439
 we try then to complete the 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.439
 five laps 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.360
 and already arriving here we observe the tip 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.460
 main and the other tip where has 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.369
 finished they have to give very similar or 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.290
 very very close to each other 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.960
 we cut up here and these two points 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.180
 then we're going to put it together like this 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.090
 way we press well here dyn down 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.100
 to start cutting 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.100
 we try to be the same arrowhead 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.210
 we're here 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.210
 and we do the same thing on the other side 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.870
 we cut 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.600
 on average they average 2 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.600
 centimeters 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.900
 and another one towards there perfect now we have 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.110
 the two corners the two thin tips 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.390
 we are going to put them together 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.610
 and we already have a sample of more or less 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.530
 how are you going to see the bow the step 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.140
 next then is to take the strip 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.670
 thin red 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.670
 we tied her in this position 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.080
 we are going to tie very hard in order to 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.180
 that is not going to let go and to be able 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.180
 continue and do the next process 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.620
 well we give it another round to ensure 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.920
 a little more 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:55.180
 and then we started to take out the 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.799
 tapes first we took a first pair 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.260
 remember that every time we go 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.480
 taking out a tape we give half a turn 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:06.299
 so that it is left of this 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:09.299
 way to stable once and do not go to 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.299
 develop 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:16.200
 as we take out the strips is 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.630
 necessary and placing them with this 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.030
 we avoid then that the bow goes to 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.730
 get overloaded to one side and 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.959
 to be very balanced when 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.959
 let's look at the end 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.260
 we take out then each strip 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:42.360
 this is the last process you 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:45.030
 they observe is very easy it is very repetitive 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.880
 remember that this monkey serves to 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.610
 decorating boxes to decorate gifts that 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.910
 they are given in this case a small size 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:57.410
 and we can even attach to any 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.410
 card that we wish to give away 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.790
 We keep pulling until we complete the 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:09.710
 whole bun 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:12.320
 well let's always remember 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.420
 be very careful when tying 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.820
 because in case of not doing it very 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.700
 well the bow can be released and 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.450
 we can have inconveniences we repeat 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.450
 the process 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.330
 we continue we are already finished 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:39.940
 these last two are missing 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:43.000
 and you can see that we have already 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.270
 finished the bun was nice 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.040
 remember that the colors and every here 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.660
 can mix us as you want in this 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.480
 case we are using only two 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:56.780
 colors I hope you liked it 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.250
 see you in a next tutorial not 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.500
 forget to subscribe to follow 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.240
 enjoying much more videos than 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.780
 have a happy evening that is very well
