00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
being a so for example let's say that

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.800 
being a so for example let's say that
the<00:02:12.520> percentage<00:02:12.970> difference<00:02:13.000> between<00:02:13.630> your

core right your stabilizers and your
prime<00:02:17.080> movers<00:02:17.440> was<00:02:18.599> 60/40<00:02:19.630> right<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.170> that's

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
prime movers was 60/40 right and that's

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.620 
prime movers was 60/40 right and that's
what<00:02:21.280> caused<00:02:21.519> this<00:02:21.760> little<00:02:22.150> tweak<00:02:22.390> in<00:02:22.540> your

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
what caused this little tweak in your

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.300 
what caused this little tweak in your
back<00:02:22.780> your<00:02:23.140> herniated<00:02:23.560> disc<00:02:23.800> which<00:02:24.040> is<00:02:24.069> not<00:02:24.280> a

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
big deal but you're gonna have to heal

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.360 
big deal but you're gonna have to heal
they're<00:02:26.440> gonna<00:02:26.530> have<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:26.709> sort<00:02:27.069> of<00:02:27.130> deal<00:02:27.340> with

they're gonna have to sort of deal with

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.420 
they're gonna have to sort of deal with
it<00:02:27.640> cause<00:02:28.300> this<00:02:28.599> to<00:02:28.750> happen<00:02:28.780> right<00:02:29.319> now<00:02:29.560> if<00:02:30.340> you

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
it cause this to happen right now if you

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.890 
it cause this to happen right now if you
go<00:02:30.550> and<00:02:30.580> put<00:02:30.790> on<00:02:30.880> a<00:02:30.910> belt<00:02:31.209> because<00:02:31.750> you're

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
go and put on a belt because you're

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.080 
go and put on a belt because you're
injured<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:33.280> prime<00:02:33.580> mover<00:02:33.849> is<00:02:33.910> gonna

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
injured the prime mover is gonna

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.420 
injured the prime mover is gonna
continue<00:02:34.480> getting<00:02:34.630> stronger<00:02:35.050> right<00:02:35.769> so<00:02:36.190> say

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
continue getting stronger right so say

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.880 
continue getting stronger right so say
they<00:02:36.610> increase<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.810> percent<00:02:38.230> increases<00:02:38.769> the

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
they increase the percent increases the

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.559 
they increase the percent increases the
percentage<00:02:39.310> of<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:39.549> strength<00:02:39.880> difference

to use those stabilizers the belt

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.570 
to use those stabilizers the belt
becomes<00:02:50.410> your<00:02:50.500> stabilizer<00:02:50.860> but<00:02:51.430> you're

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
becomes your stabilizer but you're

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.979 
becomes your stabilizer but you're
continue<00:02:51.910> to<00:02:52.000> get<00:02:52.150> stronger<00:02:52.510> in<00:02:52.720> your<00:02:52.810> prime

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
continue to get stronger in your prime

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.130 
continue to get stronger in your prime
movers<00:02:53.319> so<00:02:53.860> instead<00:02:54.280> of<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:54.489> being<00:02:54.989> 60/40<00:02:55.989> the

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.750 
movers so instead of it being 60/40 the
difference<00:02:56.530> which<00:02:56.739> was<00:02:56.950> just<00:02:57.190> slight<00:02:57.489> and

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
difference which was just slight and

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.559 
difference which was just slight and
caused<00:02:57.940> your<00:02:58.150> injury<00:02:58.540> you're<00:02:58.959> gonna<00:02:59.080> further

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
caused your injury you're gonna further

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.630 
caused your injury you're gonna further
widen<00:03:01.569> the<00:03:01.720> gap<00:03:02.049> between<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.310> two<00:03:03.430> I<00:03:03.459> hope

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
widen the gap between the two I hope

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.949 
widen the gap between the two I hope
this<00:03:03.819> all<00:03:03.970> makes<00:03:04.150> sense<00:03:04.299> are<00:03:04.510> you<00:03:04.599> following

there are exercises that you can do
based<00:04:22.930> on<00:04:23.200> where<00:04:24.010> the<00:04:24.250> Bulge<00:04:24.490> is<00:04:24.880> where<00:04:25.330> it's

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
based on where the Bulge is where it's

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.240 
based on where the Bulge is where it's
herniated<00:04:26.320> right<00:04:26.590> so<00:04:26.860> if<00:04:26.920> this<00:04:27.010> is<00:04:27.130> your

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
herniated right so if this is your

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.000 
herniated right so if this is your
vertebra<00:04:27.780> if<00:04:28.780> it's<00:04:28.930> if<00:04:29.170> the<00:04:29.410> Bulge<00:04:29.770> is

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
vertebra if it's if the Bulge is

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.830 
vertebra if it's if the Bulge is
herniated<00:04:30.640> anteriorly<00:04:31.270> they're<00:04:31.600> gonna<00:04:31.720> be

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
herniated anteriorly they're gonna be

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.990 
herniated anteriorly they're gonna be
exercises<00:04:32.320> associated<00:04:32.740> with<00:04:32.830> that<00:04:33.000> laterally

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000

or posterior lis depending on where the

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.380 
or posterior lis depending on where the
Bulge<00:04:36.130> is<00:04:36.310> you<00:04:36.640> should<00:04:36.820> know<00:04:36.970> if<00:04:37.120> you<00:04:37.150> went<00:04:37.330> to
