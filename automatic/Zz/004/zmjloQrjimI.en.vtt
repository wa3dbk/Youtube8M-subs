00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.770 

today<00:00:01.439> I'm<00:00:01.680> trellising<00:00:02.340> my<00:00:02.520> beans<00:00:02.909> and<00:00:03.240> since

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
today I'm trellising my beans and since

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.329 
today I'm trellising my beans and since
I<00:00:03.899> haven't<00:00:04.049> seen<00:00:04.350> too<00:00:04.589> many<00:00:04.710> people<00:00:04.859> on

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
I haven't seen too many people on

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.480 
I haven't seen too many people on
YouTube<00:00:06.200> do<00:00:07.200> trellis<00:00:07.649> their<00:00:07.830> beans<00:00:08.010> this<00:00:08.309> way

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
YouTube do trellis their beans this way

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.190 
YouTube do trellis their beans this way
I<00:00:08.519> thought<00:00:08.849> that<00:00:09.000> I<00:00:09.030> would<00:00:09.210> do<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.330> video<00:00:09.570> if

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
I thought that I would do a video if

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.749 
I thought that I would do a video if
this<00:00:10.380> is<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.620> way<00:00:10.710> both<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:11.099> my<00:00:11.160> grandmothers

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
this is the way both of my grandmothers

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.169 
this is the way both of my grandmothers
did<00:00:11.790> it<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.590> I<00:00:13.590> thought<00:00:14.340> it<00:00:14.490> was<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.700> only<00:00:14.849> way

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
did it and I thought it was the only way

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.650 
did it and I thought it was the only way
it<00:00:15.450> was<00:00:15.599> done<00:00:15.900> until<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:16.920> watched<00:00:17.250> YouTube<00:00:17.730> but

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
it was done until I watched YouTube but

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.450 
it was done until I watched YouTube but
this<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.020> probably<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.410> cheapest<00:00:19.830> way<00:00:20.010> but

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
this is probably the cheapest way but

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.620 
this is probably the cheapest way but
it's<00:00:20.670> probably<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.029> most<00:00:21.270> labor-intensive

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
it's probably the most labor-intensive

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.490 
it's probably the most labor-intensive
way<00:00:22.400> does<00:00:23.400> take<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.609> lot<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.910> work<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.500> I

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
way does take a lot of work and I

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.950 
way does take a lot of work and I
already<00:00:25.890> set<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.340> post<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:27.119> just<00:00:27.390> dug<00:00:27.720> holes

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
already set the post I just dug holes

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.250 
already set the post I just dug holes
with<00:00:28.230> post<00:00:28.529> hole<00:00:28.710> diggers<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.130> I'm<00:00:29.939> using

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
with post hole diggers and I'm using

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.490 
with post hole diggers and I'm using
landscape<00:00:31.260> timbers<00:00:31.500> for<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.160> post<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:33.500> now

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
landscape timbers for the post and now

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.319 
landscape timbers for the post and now
I'm<00:00:34.590> going<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.920> run<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.340> top<00:00:35.579> wire<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:35.969> bottom

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
I'm going to run the top wire and bottom

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.369 
I'm going to run the top wire and bottom
wire<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.899> for<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.590> wire<00:00:37.800> always<00:00:38.460> use<00:00:38.760> of

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
wire and for the wire always use of

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.030 
wire and for the wire always use of
galvanized<00:00:40.379> wire

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
galvanized wire

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.340 
galvanized wire
here's<00:00:41.250> an<00:00:41.399> old<00:00:41.550> package<00:00:42.090> 16<00:00:43.050> gauge

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
here's an old package 16 gauge

here's an old package 16 gauge
galvanized<00:00:44.160> wire<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.120> use<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.600> because

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
galvanized wire and I use this because

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.920 
galvanized wire and I use this because
it<00:00:46.320> doesn't<00:00:46.469> rust<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.510> that<00:00:48.510> way<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.690> can<00:00:48.899> use

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
it doesn't rust and that way I can use

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.040 
it doesn't rust and that way I can use
the<00:00:49.230> wire<00:00:49.410> year<00:00:49.980> after<00:00:50.340> year<00:00:50.700> there's<00:00:51.050> some

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
the wire year after year there's some

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.130 
the wire year after year there's some
that<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.500> keep<00:00:52.829> reusing<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.660> the<00:00:54.660> first<00:00:54.899> thing

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
that I keep reusing and the first thing

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.529 
that I keep reusing and the first thing
I<00:00:55.170> did<00:00:55.469> was<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:56.129> nailed<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:58.010> staple<00:00:59.010> at<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.239> post

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
I did was I nailed a staple at the post

I did was I nailed a staple at the post
I'm<00:01:01.020> going<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.440> run<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.620> wire<00:01:01.859> from<00:01:02.250> one<00:01:02.820> post<00:01:03.210> to

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390

I'm going to run a wire from one post to
the<00:01:03.570> other<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.170> run<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.830> through<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.189> staple

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
I'm now to keep the wire from sliding up

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.250 
I'm now to keep the wire from sliding up
or<00:01:08.430> down<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.909> will<00:01:09.000> hold<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.420> place<00:01:09.479> and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
or down it will hold it in place and

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.060 
or down it will hold it in place and
always<00:01:10.770> do<00:01:11.720> one<00:01:12.720> separate<00:01:13.409> piece<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.830> wire

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
always do one separate piece of wire

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.999 
always do one separate piece of wire
between<00:01:14.369> each<00:01:14.790> post<00:01:15.229> because<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.560> way<00:01:16.740> if

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
between each post because that way if

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.920 
between each post because that way if
the<00:01:17.189> wire<00:01:17.369> should<00:01:17.640> break<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.210> won't<00:01:18.420> lose<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
the wire should break I won't lose the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.890 
the wire should break I won't lose the
whole<00:01:19.400> row<00:01:20.400> I'll<00:01:21.090> just<00:01:21.299> lose<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.600> one

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
whole row I'll just lose that one

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.590 
whole row I'll just lose that one
section<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.729> I've<00:01:23.729> never<00:01:23.939> had<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.270> wire

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
section and I've never had the wire

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.530 
section and I've never had the wire
break<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.380> don't<00:01:25.979> use<00:01:26.189> rope<00:01:26.549> or<00:01:26.880> anything<00:01:27.299> like

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
break I don't use rope or anything like

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.440 
break I don't use rope or anything like
that<00:01:27.600> because<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.530> tends<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.890> stretch<00:01:29.450> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
that because it tends to stretch the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.340 
that because it tends to stretch the
wire<00:01:30.600> holds<00:01:31.079> up<00:01:31.200> very<00:01:31.470> well<00:01:33.110> okay<00:01:34.110> I've<00:01:34.200> got

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
wire holds up very well okay I've got

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.980 
wire holds up very well okay I've got
the<00:01:34.500> first<00:01:34.770> bottom<00:01:35.250> wire<00:01:35.460> on<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:36.000> just<00:01:36.210> ran<00:01:36.840> it

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
the first bottom wire on I just ran it

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.999 
the first bottom wire on I just ran it
from<00:01:37.200> one<00:01:37.409> post<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.009> other<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:39.829> run<00:01:40.829> the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
from one post to the other and run the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.630 
from one post to the other and run the
wire<00:01:41.220> through<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.759> staple<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:43.280> then<00:01:44.280> just

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
wire through the staple and then just

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.950 
wire through the staple and then just
wrap<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.180> one<00:01:45.930> end<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.290> wire<00:01:46.500> around<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
wrap the one end of the wire around the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.179 
wrap the one end of the wire around the
long<00:01:48.960> piece<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.560> then<00:01:49.680> bend<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:49.979> back<00:01:50.159> on

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
long piece and then bend it back on

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.600 
long piece and then bend it back on
itself<00:01:53.509> okay<00:01:54.509> now<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.869> have<00:01:55.200> my<00:01:55.530> top<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:55.920> bottom

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
itself okay now I have my top and bottom

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.670 
itself okay now I have my top and bottom
wires<00:01:56.850> on<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.719> don't<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:58.049> probably<00:01:58.229> can't

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
wires on and I don't you probably can't

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.490 
wires on and I don't you probably can't
even<00:01:58.860> see<00:01:59.280> this<00:01:59.490> wire<00:01:59.790> but<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.450> left<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.290> lot<00:02:01.439> of

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
even see this wire but I left a lot of

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
even see this wire but I left a lot of
slack<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.719> top<00:02:03.960> wire<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.680> now<00:02:05.369> I'm

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
slack in this the top wire and now I'm

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.449 
slack in this the top wire and now I'm
going<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.880> run<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.090> guide<00:02:06.420> wire<00:02:06.840> from<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.829> end

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
going to run a guide wire from the end

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.940 
going to run a guide wire from the end
post<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.200> stake<00:02:10.679> in<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.009> ground

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
post to that stake in the ground

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.180 
post to that stake in the ground
and<00:02:12.849> I'll<00:02:13.030> pull<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.450> slack<00:02:13.720> out<00:02:14.080> of<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:17.190> the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
and I'll pull the slack out of the the

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.059 
and I'll pull the slack out of the the
top<00:02:18.459> wire<00:02:18.730> I<00:02:21.060> tightening<00:02:22.060> up<00:02:22.209> this<00:02:22.420> guide<00:02:22.660> wire

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
top wire I tightening up this guide wire

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.059 
top wire I tightening up this guide wire
and<00:02:24.069> I<00:02:24.160> have<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.400> staple<00:02:25.330> on<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.510> side<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:26.830> hold

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
and I have a staple on the side to hold

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:33.540 
and I have a staple on the side to hold
that<00:02:27.310> wire<00:02:30.510> okay<00:02:31.510> now<00:02:31.720> I<00:02:31.750> have<00:02:32.050> that<00:02:32.350> on<00:02:32.620> the

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
that wire okay now I have that on the

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.290 
that wire okay now I have that on the
bracing<00:02:34.390> wire<00:02:34.630> up<00:02:35.050> you<00:02:35.890> see<00:02:36.700> that<00:02:36.880> it<00:02:37.000> pulled

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
bracing wire up you see that it pulled

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.180 
bracing wire up you see that it pulled
some<00:02:37.660> of<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.870> slack<00:02:38.170> out<00:02:38.410> of<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.650> top<00:02:38.890> wire

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
some of the slack out of the top wire

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.180 
some of the slack out of the top wire
now<00:02:40.120> I'll<00:02:40.360> go<00:02:40.569> along<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.170> just<00:02:41.560> all<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:41.980> top

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
now I'll go along and just all the top

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.690 
now I'll go along and just all the top
wire<00:02:42.519> try<00:02:43.390> to<00:02:43.450> get<00:02:43.630> that<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:43.900> little<00:02:44.230> tighter<00:02:44.700> it

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
wire try to get that a little tighter it

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.430 
wire try to get that a little tighter it
doesn't<00:02:45.940> have<00:02:46.060> to<00:02:46.120> be<00:02:46.209> perfectly<00:02:46.660> tight<00:02:46.989> but

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
doesn't have to be perfectly tight but

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.820 
doesn't have to be perfectly tight but
when<00:02:48.250> I<00:02:48.280> put<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.819> vertical<00:02:49.330> strings<00:02:49.959> on<00:02:50.319> if

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
when I put the vertical strings on if

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.970 
when I put the vertical strings on if
it's<00:02:51.549> too<00:02:52.030> slack<00:02:52.480> then<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:55.080> top<00:02:56.080> wire<00:02:56.350> wind<00:02:56.680> up

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
it's too slack then the top wire wind up

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.539 
it's too slack then the top wire wind up
pulling<00:02:57.250> down<00:02:58.110> lower<00:02:59.110> it's<00:03:00.069> going<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.370> pull

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
pulling down lower it's going to pull

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.449 
pulling down lower it's going to pull
down<00:03:00.730> some<00:03:01.470> but<00:03:02.470> when<00:03:02.980> we<00:03:03.069> get<00:03:03.250> a<00:03:03.280> little

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
down some but when we get a little

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:04.979 
down some but when we get a little
tighter<00:03:03.819> than<00:03:03.970> that<00:03:04.360> and<00:03:04.569> I'm<00:03:04.630> going<00:03:04.810> to<00:03:04.840> have

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
tighter than that and I'm going to have

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.259 
tighter than that and I'm going to have
to<00:03:05.110> do<00:03:05.230> this<00:03:05.410> tomorrow<00:03:05.790> because<00:03:06.790> I<00:03:06.880> need<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.060> go

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
to do this tomorrow because I need to go

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.050 
to do this tomorrow because I need to go
in<00:03:07.450> and<00:03:07.569> cook<00:03:07.750> dinner<00:03:07.930> now<00:03:08.549> okay<00:03:09.549> I<00:03:09.580> went<00:03:09.790> along

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
in and cook dinner now okay I went along

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.809 
in and cook dinner now okay I went along
and<00:03:10.120> I<00:03:10.420> tightened<00:03:10.810> up<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.200> top<00:03:11.410> wire<00:03:11.739> as<00:03:12.430> best

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
and I tightened up the top wire as best

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.420 
and I tightened up the top wire as best
I<00:03:12.940> could<00:03:13.590> like<00:03:14.590> that<00:03:14.769> doesn't<00:03:14.950> have<00:03:15.190> to<00:03:15.280> be

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
I could like that doesn't have to be

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.650 
I could like that doesn't have to be
perfectly<00:03:15.910> tight<00:03:16.269> and<00:03:16.650> I've<00:03:17.650> started

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
perfectly tight and I've started

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
perfectly tight and I've started
stringing<00:03:19.660> up<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.530> vertical<00:03:20.739> strings<00:03:21.519> and

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
stringing up the vertical strings and

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
stringing up the vertical strings and
what<00:03:23.680> I<00:03:23.709> did<00:03:24.010> was<00:03:24.340> I<00:03:24.780> tied<00:03:25.780> it<00:03:26.140> right<00:03:27.130> here<00:03:27.519> at

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
what I did was I tied it right here at

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.220 
what I did was I tied it right here at
the<00:03:27.790> beginning<00:03:28.120> and<00:03:28.769> then<00:03:29.769> I<00:03:29.980> just<00:03:30.190> run<00:03:30.459> the

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
the beginning and then I just run the

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.410 
the beginning and then I just run the
strings<00:03:32.230> up<00:03:32.620> and<00:03:32.920> down<00:03:33.160> and<00:03:33.579> I'll<00:03:34.060> loop<00:03:34.269> it

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
strings up and down and I'll loop it

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.500 
strings up and down and I'll loop it
twice<00:03:34.750> across<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.739> wire<00:03:36.000> I'll<00:03:37.000> show<00:03:37.239> you<00:03:37.299> how

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
twice across the wire I'll show you how

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.099 
twice across the wire I'll show you how
I<00:03:37.540> do<00:03:37.660> that<00:03:38.519> okay<00:03:39.519> for<00:03:39.579> this<00:03:39.850> I<00:03:40.060> use<00:03:40.420> a<00:03:40.450> bailing

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
I do that okay for this I use a bailing

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.229 
I do that okay for this I use a bailing
twine<00:03:41.290> I<00:03:41.440> found<00:03:41.980> that<00:03:42.280> something<00:03:42.700> like<00:03:42.790> cotton

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
twine I found that something like cotton

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.130 
twine I found that something like cotton
string<00:03:43.630> won't<00:03:44.320> hold<00:03:44.620> up<00:03:44.950> long<00:03:45.130> enough<00:03:45.549> to<00:03:45.880> work

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
string won't hold up long enough to work

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.680 
string won't hold up long enough to work
it<00:03:47.140> will<00:03:47.320> usually<00:03:47.920> rotten<00:03:48.850> break<00:03:49.120> before<00:03:49.600> the

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
it will usually rotten break before the

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.840 
it will usually rotten break before the
season<00:03:50.049> is<00:03:50.170> over<00:03:50.380> and<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:51.370> last<00:03:51.609> thing<00:03:51.820> you

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
season is over and the last thing you

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.920 
season is over and the last thing you
want<00:03:52.150> to<00:03:52.269> do<00:03:52.660> is<00:03:52.959> have<00:03:53.650> your<00:03:54.269> your<00:03:55.269> string

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
want to do is have your your string

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.280 
want to do is have your your string
break<00:03:56.260> on<00:03:56.530> you<00:03:56.850> so<00:03:57.850> all<00:03:58.090> I<00:03:58.120> do<00:03:58.420> is<00:03:58.720> loop<00:03:59.109> it

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
break on you so all I do is loop it

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.830 
break on you so all I do is loop it
around<00:03:59.380> the<00:03:59.739> wire<00:04:00.010> twice<00:04:00.489> at<00:04:00.880> the<00:04:00.910> bottom<00:04:01.480> and

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
around the wire twice at the bottom and

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.680 
around the wire twice at the bottom and
then<00:04:02.829> go<00:04:03.069> up<00:04:03.370> and<00:04:03.609> loop<00:04:03.819> it<00:04:03.940> around<00:04:04.060> the<00:04:04.359> top

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
then go up and loop it around the top

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.270 
then go up and loop it around the top
twice<00:04:05.440> and<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:07.510> reason<00:04:07.989> you<00:04:08.079> want<00:04:08.260> to<00:04:08.410> loop<00:04:09.130> it

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
twice and the reason you want to loop it

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.440 
twice and the reason you want to loop it
around<00:04:09.340> twice<00:04:09.910> is<00:04:10.329> because<00:04:13.350> when<00:04:14.350> the<00:04:14.620> vine

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
around twice is because when the vine

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.560 
around twice is because when the vine
grabs<00:04:16.450> hold<00:04:16.720> of<00:04:17.049> the<00:04:17.760> string<00:04:18.760> it<00:04:19.060> can<00:04:19.239> create<00:04:19.510> a

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
grabs hold of the string it can create a

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.539 
grabs hold of the string it can create a
little<00:04:19.810> bit<00:04:19.959> of<00:04:20.109> a<00:04:20.200> slack<00:04:20.560> there

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
little bit of a slack there

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.610 
little bit of a slack there
and<00:04:21.639> if<00:04:22.210> you<00:04:22.389> have<00:04:22.569> the<00:04:22.750> double<00:04:23.139> loop<00:04:23.319> at<00:04:23.590> the

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
and if you have the double loop at the

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.230 
and if you have the double loop at the
bottom<00:04:23.860> and<00:04:24.280> at<00:04:24.370> the<00:04:24.430> top<00:04:24.550> then<00:04:25.539> this<00:04:27.240> string

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
bottom and at the top then this string

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.710 
bottom and at the top then this string
will<00:04:28.419> tighten<00:04:28.780> up<00:04:28.870> there<00:04:29.199> at<00:04:30.069> that<00:04:30.129> loop

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
will tighten up there at that loop

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
slack in it the vine will just pull out

keep going and I'll go along several
feet<00:05:01.810> and<00:05:02.139> then<00:05:02.650> I'll<00:05:02.860> go<00:05:03.039> back<00:05:03.280> and<00:05:03.610> tighten

feet and then I'll go back and tighten

each one edge young strings you spaced

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:15.529 
each one edge young strings you spaced
them<00:05:08.440> out<00:05:08.590> maybe<00:05:09.569> 10<00:05:10.569> or<00:05:10.750> 12<00:05:10.990> inches<00:05:11.289> apart

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:15.539 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:19.290 

okay<00:05:16.539> that's<00:05:16.750> what<00:05:16.990> I<00:05:17.020> have<00:05:17.259> so<00:05:17.289> far<00:05:17.889> and<00:05:18.300> ran

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
okay that's what I have so far and ran

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.990 
okay that's what I have so far and ran
the<00:05:19.539> string<00:05:20.159> and<00:05:21.159> I<00:05:21.250> stopped<00:05:21.550> it<00:05:21.729> at<00:05:21.879> the

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
the string and I stopped it at the

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.059 
the string and I stopped it at the
halfway<00:05:22.210> point<00:05:22.419> tied<00:05:23.289> it<00:05:23.469> off<00:05:23.620> and<00:05:23.979> then

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:24.069 
halfway point tied it off and then

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:25.589 
halfway point tied it off and then
started<00:05:24.400> a<00:05:24.460> new<00:05:24.580> piece<00:05:24.849> of<00:05:24.879> string<00:05:25.300> and<00:05:25.509> that

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
started a new piece of string and that

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:27.570 
started a new piece of string and that
way<00:05:25.810> if<00:05:26.110> it<00:05:26.289> should<00:05:26.469> break<00:05:26.710> I<00:05:26.979> wouldn't<00:05:27.490> lose

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
way if it should break I wouldn't lose

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.100 
way if it should break I wouldn't lose
the<00:05:27.759> whole<00:05:27.909> section<00:05:28.240> that<00:05:28.449> would<00:05:28.659> only<00:05:28.810> be<00:05:28.990> a

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
the whole section that would only be a

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.920 
the whole section that would only be a
half<00:05:29.409> a<00:05:29.560> section<00:05:30.039> and<00:05:30.219> I<00:05:30.789> could<00:05:30.969> go<00:05:31.659> in<00:05:31.780> and

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
half a section and I could go in and

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.510 
half a section and I could go in and
correct<00:05:32.050> it<00:05:32.380> easier<00:05:32.770> if<00:05:33.069> that<00:05:33.280> should<00:05:33.460> happen

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
correct it easier if that should happen

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.399 
correct it easier if that should happen
it<00:05:34.330> rarely<00:05:34.659> happens<00:05:36.360> so<00:05:37.360> I'm<00:05:37.750> done<00:05:38.110> with<00:05:38.169> the

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:38.409 
it rarely happens so I'm done with the

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:40.649 
it rarely happens so I'm done with the
trellis<00:05:39.039> it<00:05:39.310> took<00:05:39.550> me<00:05:39.789> about<00:05:40.120> an<00:05:40.330> hour<00:05:40.449> to

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:40.659 
trellis it took me about an hour to

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:43.290 
trellis it took me about an hour to
string<00:05:41.080> it<00:05:41.199> up<00:05:41.380> I<00:05:41.860> planted<00:05:42.460> Kentucky<00:05:42.909> wonder

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
string it up I planted Kentucky wonder

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.409 
string it up I planted Kentucky wonder
pole<00:05:43.779> beans<00:05:44.080> here<00:05:44.710> and<00:05:44.969> that's<00:05:45.969> what<00:05:46.180> my

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
pole beans here and that's what my

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.290 
pole beans here and that's what my
grandma<00:05:46.930> always<00:05:47.169> liked<00:05:47.560> the<00:05:47.710> best<00:05:48.270> over<00:05:49.270> the

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
grandma always liked the best over the

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.570 
grandma always liked the best over the
past<00:05:49.840> several<00:05:50.110> years<00:05:50.259> I've<00:05:50.740> used<00:05:50.770> Blue<00:05:51.340> Lake

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
past several years I've used Blue Lake

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.600 
past several years I've used Blue Lake
pole<00:05:52.150> beans<00:05:52.449> and<00:05:53.169> I've<00:05:53.830> started<00:05:54.219> having

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
pole beans and I've started having

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.050 
pole beans and I've started having
problems<00:05:54.759> with<00:05:55.240> them<00:05:55.529> they<00:05:56.529> would<00:05:57.060> grow

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
problems with them they would grow

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.999 
problems with them they would grow
beautifully<00:05:58.779> but<00:05:59.349> they<00:05:59.469> wouldn't<00:05:59.650> produce<00:05:59.800> a

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:00.009 
beautifully but they wouldn't produce a

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:01.559 
beautifully but they wouldn't produce a
whole<00:06:00.159> lot<00:06:00.370> of<00:06:00.400> beans<00:06:00.699> and<00:06:00.969> I<00:06:01.060> thought<00:06:01.270> it<00:06:01.419> was

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:01.569 
whole lot of beans and I thought it was

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:05.850 
whole lot of beans and I thought it was
due<00:06:01.900> to<00:06:02.069> hot<00:06:03.069> weather<00:06:03.400> or<00:06:03.849> a<00:06:04.389> lack<00:06:04.930> of<00:06:04.960> bees<00:06:05.409> or

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
due to hot weather or a lack of bees or

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.939 
due to hot weather or a lack of bees or
something<00:06:06.340> but<00:06:06.870> I've<00:06:07.870> seen<00:06:08.139> comments<00:06:08.710> on<00:06:08.860> the

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:08.949 
something but I've seen comments on the

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:10.320 
something but I've seen comments on the
internet<00:06:09.340> from<00:06:09.490> other<00:06:09.699> people<00:06:10.060> and<00:06:10.210> they've

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
internet from other people and they've

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.850 
internet from other people and they've
had<00:06:10.509> the<00:06:10.630> same<00:06:10.840> problem<00:06:11.259> with<00:06:11.380> them<00:06:11.529> so<00:06:11.710> I'm

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
had the same problem with them so I'm

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.070 
had the same problem with them so I'm
done<00:06:12.069> with<00:06:12.130> the<00:06:12.370> blue<00:06:12.669> lakes<00:06:13.000> and<00:06:13.270> a<00:06:13.300> couple

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
done with the blue lakes and a couple

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.930 
done with the blue lakes and a couple
years<00:06:14.199> ago<00:06:14.469> I<00:06:14.560> planted<00:06:14.979> some<00:06:15.039> Blue<00:06:15.370> Lake<00:06:15.610> bush

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
years ago I planted some Blue Lake bush

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.740 
years ago I planted some Blue Lake bush
beans<00:06:16.300> and<00:06:18.029> they<00:06:19.029> started<00:06:19.389> putting<00:06:19.569> out

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
beans and they started putting out

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.529 
beans and they started putting out
runners<00:06:20.319> so<00:06:20.590> I<00:06:20.650> had<00:06:20.889> to<00:06:21.039> run<00:06:21.880> out<00:06:22.029> here<00:06:22.360> and

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:22.539 
runners so I had to run out here and

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:25.559 
runners so I had to run out here and
string<00:06:23.139> those<00:06:23.440> up<00:06:23.800> and<00:06:24.190> it<00:06:24.729> turned<00:06:24.969> out<00:06:25.180> that

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:25.569 
string those up and it turned out that

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:28.499 
string those up and it turned out that
about<00:06:25.719> 1/4<00:06:26.229> of<00:06:26.590> them<00:06:26.800> were<00:06:27.090> some<00:06:28.090> kind<00:06:28.300> of<00:06:28.360> off

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:28.509 
about 1/4 of them were some kind of off

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:30.600 
about 1/4 of them were some kind of off
flat<00:06:28.930> Italian<00:06:29.589> bean<00:06:29.830> and<00:06:30.099> they<00:06:30.159> didn't<00:06:30.430> taste

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:30.610 
flat Italian bean and they didn't taste

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.990 
flat Italian bean and they didn't taste
good<00:06:30.759> either<00:06:31.149> so<00:06:31.960> I<00:06:32.440> am<00:06:32.979> completely<00:06:33.520> finished

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
good either so I am completely finished

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.040 
good either so I am completely finished
with<00:06:34.120> Blue<00:06:34.479> Lakes

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.050 
with Blue Lakes

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.839 
with Blue Lakes
I'm<00:06:35.440> going<00:06:35.800> back<00:06:35.979> to<00:06:36.159> what<00:06:36.310> my<00:06:36.430> grandma

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:36.849 
I'm going back to what my grandma

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:38.730 
I'm going back to what my grandma
thought<00:06:37.120> was<00:06:37.330> the<00:06:37.419> best<00:06:37.629> and<00:06:38.020> she<00:06:38.319> she

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740 
thought was the best and she she

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.430 
thought was the best and she she
preferred<00:06:39.129> the<00:06:39.159> Kentucky<00:06:39.789> wonders<00:06:40.240> so<00:06:40.990> now<00:06:41.409> I

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 
preferred the Kentucky wonders so now I

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.629 
preferred the Kentucky wonders so now I
need<00:06:41.860> to<00:06:42.360> run<00:06:43.360> another<00:06:43.949> trellis<00:06:44.949> to<00:06:45.250> the<00:06:45.370> left

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:45.639 
need to run another trellis to the left

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:50.249 
need to run another trellis to the left
of<00:06:45.849> this<00:06:46.090> for<00:06:46.509> my<00:06:46.659> butter<00:06:46.870> beans<00:06:47.199> and<00:06:49.259> it

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:50.259 
of this for my butter beans and it

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:52.110 
of this for my butter beans and it
doesn't<00:06:50.590> take<00:06:50.770> all<00:06:50.919> that<00:06:50.949> long<00:06:51.129> it<00:06:51.550> is<00:06:51.699> a<00:06:51.729> bit

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 
doesn't take all that long it is a bit

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.089 
doesn't take all that long it is a bit
of<00:06:52.210> work<00:06:52.419> but<00:06:52.780> I<00:06:52.810> said<00:06:53.289> it's<00:06:53.560> probably<00:06:53.949> the

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:54.099 
of work but I said it's probably the

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:58.110 
of work but I said it's probably the
cheapest<00:06:54.699> way<00:06:54.879> to<00:06:54.909> go<00:06:55.270> and<00:06:56.669> it<00:06:57.669> just<00:06:57.940> doesn't

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.120 
cheapest way to go and it just doesn't

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.899 
cheapest way to go and it just doesn't
feel<00:06:58.599> like<00:06:58.659> a<00:06:58.870> garden<00:06:59.409> to<00:06:59.590> me<00:06:59.740> without<00:07:00.220> without

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:00.909 
feel like a garden to me without without

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:03.990 
feel like a garden to me without without
my<00:07:01.120> being<00:07:01.330> trellis<00:07:01.810> out<00:07:02.020> here<00:07:02.669> so<00:07:03.669> I've<00:07:03.970> got

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:05.620 
everything planted and the beans have

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.459 
everything planted and the beans have
started<00:07:05.949> sprouting<00:07:06.190> through<00:07:06.550> the<00:07:06.639> ground<00:07:06.940> and

00:07:07.459 --> 00:07:07.469 
started sprouting through the ground and

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:10.350

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:24.969 
the tiller up down the rows and push a

00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:28.670 
the tiller up down the rows and push a
little<00:07:25.240> more<00:07:25.509> dirt<00:07:25.870> up<00:07:26.139> around<00:07:26.379> my<00:07:27.190> plants<00:07:27.789> and

just keep it weeded with a hoe up and

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:35.040 
just keep it weeded with a hoe up and
down<00:07:33.099> the<00:07:33.250> rows<00:07:33.460> and<00:07:34.000> it's<00:07:34.180> not<00:07:34.479> a<00:07:34.509> whole<00:07:34.810> lot

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.050 
down the rows and it's not a whole lot

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.899 
down the rows and it's not a whole lot
of<00:07:35.080> work<00:07:35.379> to<00:07:35.590> do<00:07:35.680> a<00:07:35.710> garden<00:07:36.009> like<00:07:36.280> this<00:07:36.580> and<00:07:36.849> a

00:07:36.899 --> 00:07:36.909 
of work to do a garden like this and a

00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:38.700 
of work to do a garden like this and a
lot<00:07:37.090> of<00:07:37.150> people<00:07:37.479> have<00:07:37.659> misconceptions<00:07:37.990> about

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:38.710 
lot of people have misconceptions about

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.879 
lot of people have misconceptions about
it<00:07:39.130> but<00:07:39.340> it<00:07:39.909> really<00:07:40.210> isn't<00:07:40.539> as<00:07:41.080> bad<00:07:41.440> as<00:07:41.500> you

00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:41.889 
it but it really isn't as bad as you

00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:46.350 
it but it really isn't as bad as you
think<00:07:42.779> all<00:07:43.779> I<00:07:43.840> did<00:07:44.110> was<00:07:44.319> till<00:07:44.650> it<00:07:44.800> up<00:07:44.949> and<00:07:45.360> then

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.360 
think all I did was till it up and then

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.830 
think all I did was till it up and then
Hill<00:07:46.690> it<00:07:46.840> up<00:07:46.990> plant<00:07:47.409> it<00:07:47.620> I<00:07:48.419> said<00:07:49.419> now<00:07:49.569> it's<00:07:49.719> just

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.840 
Hill it up plant it I said now it's just

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.010 
Hill it up plant it I said now it's just
a<00:07:49.990> matter<00:07:50.110> of<00:07:50.229> keeping<00:07:50.440> it<00:07:50.740> weeded<00:07:51.159> and<00:07:51.599> a<00:07:52.599> lot

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:53.020 
a matter of keeping it weeded and a lot

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.320 
a matter of keeping it weeded and a lot
of<00:07:53.050> ways<00:07:53.289> it<00:07:53.620> can<00:07:53.740> be<00:07:53.860> easier<00:07:54.159> to<00:07:54.400> weed<00:07:54.669> a<00:07:54.969> big

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:55.330 
of ways it can be easier to weed a big

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.330 
of ways it can be easier to weed a big
garden<00:07:55.539> like<00:07:55.810> this<00:07:55.840> done<00:07:56.409> a<00:07:56.440> very<00:07:56.650> small<00:07:57.039> one

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:57.340 
garden like this done a very small one

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:01.620 
garden like this done a very small one
because<00:07:58.060> you<00:07:58.180> can<00:07:58.389> use<00:07:58.419> the<00:07:59.050> tiller<00:08:00.180> so<00:08:01.180> that's

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:01.630 
because you can use the tiller so that's

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:06.389 
because you can use the tiller so that's
how<00:08:01.900> I<00:08:01.930> do<00:08:02.169> the<00:08:02.650> bean<00:08:03.009> trellis<00:08:03.550> hope<00:08:03.789> it<00:08:03.969> helps
