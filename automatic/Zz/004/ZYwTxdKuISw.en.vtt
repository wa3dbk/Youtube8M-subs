00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
here it's important to me it's very

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.469

cannot<00:01:24.930> always<00:01:25.170> have<00:01:25.530> what<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.799> want

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
cannot always have what you want

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.030 
cannot always have what you want
Peter<00:01:27.180> doesn't<00:01:27.720> want<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.259> be<00:01:28.409> apart<00:01:28.680> from<00:01:28.829> her

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.670 
Peter doesn't want to be apart from her
so<00:01:29.579> that's<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:30.060> deep<00:01:30.479> inner<00:01:30.900> conflict<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.530> he

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
so that's a deep inner conflict that he

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.340 
so that's a deep inner conflict that he
has<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.130> navigate<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.299> painful<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.049> it

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
has to navigate and it's painful and it

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.679 
has to navigate and it's painful and it
creates<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.799> very<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.340> think<00:01:35.759> real<00:01:36.030> dynamic

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
creates a very I think real dynamic

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.179 
creates a very I think real dynamic
between<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.049> two<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.409> them<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.040> question

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
between the two of them and the question

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.249 
between the two of them and the question
becomes<00:01:38.640> whether<00:01:39.000> or<00:01:39.240> not<00:01:39.390> they<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:39.810> share<00:01:40.229> a

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
becomes whether or not they can share a

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.560 
becomes whether or not they can share a
path<00:01:40.590> or<00:01:41.100> whether<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.520> path<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:42.030> gonna<00:01:42.210> take
