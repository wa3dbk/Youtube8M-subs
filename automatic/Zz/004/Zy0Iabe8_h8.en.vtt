00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.550
 calls the advertising campaign is not a matter of two or three days and as I said

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.820
 and are in charge of carrying out all the acts prior to the campaign 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.400
 how is tourism 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.770
 interviews 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.020
 polls 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.680
