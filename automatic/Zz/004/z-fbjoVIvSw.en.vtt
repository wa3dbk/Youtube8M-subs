for<00:00:11.490> so<00:00:11.759> I'm<00:00:11.880> assuming<00:00:12.000> that<00:00:12.389> they're<00:00:12.540> gonna

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
for so I'm assuming that they're gonna

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.419 
for so I'm assuming that they're gonna
announce<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.139> release<00:00:13.290> date<00:00:13.469> sometime<00:00:14.040> soon

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
announce a release date sometime soon

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.460 
announce a release date sometime soon
because<00:00:15.179> generally<00:00:15.630> when<00:00:15.660> they<00:00:15.990> do<00:00:16.049> show<00:00:16.350> off

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
because generally when they do show off

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.200 
because generally when they do show off
stuff<00:00:16.800> they<00:00:16.980> do<00:00:17.039> announce<00:00:17.550> release<00:00:17.850> dates

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
stuff they do announce release dates

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.810 
stuff they do announce release dates
within<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.539> week<00:00:18.779> or<00:00:18.930> two<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.460> this<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.670> this

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
within a week or two and this is this

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.790 
within a week or two and this is this
purely<00:00:21.119> speculation<00:00:21.750> right<00:00:22.080> now<00:00:22.109> bad<00:00:22.439> say<00:00:22.740> you

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
purely speculation right now bad say you

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.189 
purely speculation right now bad say you
could<00:00:23.100> we<00:00:23.310> could<00:00:23.460> probably<00:00:23.730> expect<00:00:24.539> both<00:00:24.779> at

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
could we could probably expect both at

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.349 
could we could probably expect both at
the<00:00:25.650> end<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.920> March<00:00:26.160> beginning<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.730> April<00:00:27.119> and

purely speculation as to what this stuff

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.540 
purely speculation as to what this stuff
is<00:00:54.300> like<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:55.110> top<00:00:55.350> right<00:00:55.680> i<00:00:55.949> would<00:00:56.190> say<00:00:56.340> that's

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
is like the top right i would say that's

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.770 
is like the top right i would say that's
probably<00:00:56.750> a<00:00:57.750> iron<00:00:58.230> golem<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.399> the<00:01:00.180> very<00:01:00.420> metal

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
probably a iron golem and the very metal

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.439 
probably a iron golem and the very metal
a<00:01:00.870> lot<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.109> people<00:01:01.230> seem<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.590> think<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.309> a

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
a lot of people seem to think that is a

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.299 
a lot of people seem to think that is a
engineer<00:01:03.449> from<00:01:03.629> Team<00:01:03.870> Fortress<00:01:04.140> 2<00:01:04.320> but<00:01:05.280> I

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
engineer from Team Fortress 2 but I

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.280 
engineer from Team Fortress 2 but I
don't<00:01:05.700> know<00:01:05.820> maybe<00:01:06.180> it's<00:01:06.330> Bob<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.900> Builder

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290

don't know maybe it's Bob the Builder
you<00:01:07.950> know<00:01:08.100> can<00:01:08.520> he<00:01:08.760> fix<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.210> but<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:10.020> middle

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
you know can he fix it but the middle

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.840 
you know can he fix it but the middle
left<00:01:10.740> people<00:01:11.070> seem<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.250> think<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.820> a

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
left people seem to think that is a

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.440

Spartan top left I don't know you with
that<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.390> somebody<00:01:18.630> said<00:01:18.930> ariel<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.530> mermaid

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
that is somebody said ariel the mermaid

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.929 
that is somebody said ariel the mermaid
but<00:01:20.159> i<00:01:20.220> doubt<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:22.369> you<00:01:23.369> know<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> lot<00:01:23.909> of

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
but i doubt that and you know a lot of

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.670 
but i doubt that and you know a lot of
people<00:01:24.060> really<00:01:24.420> haven't<00:01:24.780> speculated<00:01:25.470> on<00:01:25.619> what

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
people really haven't speculated on what

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.789 
people really haven't speculated on what
the<00:01:26.100> top<00:01:26.460> middle<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:27.000> I'm<00:01:27.930> seeming<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.590> think

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
the top middle is I'm seeming to think

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.830 
the top middle is I'm seeming to think
that<00:01:28.979> since<00:01:29.220> aliens<00:01:29.729> colonial<00:01:29.939> marines<00:01:30.570> came

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
that since aliens colonial marines came

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.569 
that since aliens colonial marines came
out<00:01:31.020> recently<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.950> looks<00:01:32.130> like<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.280> soldier

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
out recently and it looks like a soldier

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.640 
out recently and it looks like a soldier
that<00:01:32.880> I'd<00:01:33.360> say<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:33.810> probably<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.200> skin<00:01:34.439> from

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
that I'd say it's probably a skin from

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.800 
that I'd say it's probably a skin from
that<00:01:34.829> game<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.820> middle<00:01:36.119> for<00:01:36.329> right<00:01:36.630> I

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
that game and the middle for right I

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.359 
that game and the middle for right I
would<00:01:36.930> say<00:01:37.049> that's<00:01:37.259> probably<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.650> skin<00:01:38.100> from

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
would say that's probably a skin from

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.520 
would say that's probably a skin from
Dragon's<00:01:38.909> Dogma<00:01:39.180> but<00:01:39.659> like<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.840> said<00:01:39.990> purely

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
Dragon's Dogma but like I said purely

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.490 
Dragon's Dogma but like I said purely
