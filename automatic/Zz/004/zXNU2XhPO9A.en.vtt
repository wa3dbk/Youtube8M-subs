the Carol's Daughter macadamia heat
protecting<00:01:45.950> serum<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:46.490> I'm<00:01:46.970> going<00:01:47.179> to<00:01:47.240> be

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
protecting serum and I'm going to be

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.919 
protecting serum and I'm going to be
applying<00:01:47.539> that<00:01:47.929> right<00:01:48.289> before<00:01:48.649> my<00:01:48.830> flatiron

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
applying that right before my flatiron

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.749 
applying that right before my flatiron
some<00:01:50.929> concentrating<00:01:51.770> this<00:01:51.860> on<00:01:52.069> the<00:01:52.190> ends<00:01:52.610> and

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
some concentrating this on the ends and

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.630 
some concentrating this on the ends and
then<00:01:53.330> I'm<00:01:53.420> working<00:01:53.690> in<00:01:53.780> sections<00:01:54.229> again

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
then I'm working in sections again

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.340 
then I'm working in sections again
taking<00:01:55.640> a<00:01:55.729> section<00:01:55.940> about<00:01:56.210> an<00:01:56.539> inch<00:01:56.780> thick<00:01:57.200> and

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
taking a section about an inch thick and

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.380 
taking a section about an inch thick and
this<00:01:57.830> is<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.280> method<00:01:58.490> that<00:01:58.700> I<00:01:58.909> use<00:01:58.970> when<00:01:59.360> I

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
this is the method that I use when I

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.240 
this is the method that I use when I
want<00:01:59.540> a<00:01:59.659> really<00:01:59.840> slick<00:02:00.170> style<00:02:00.470> so<00:02:00.799> I'm<00:02:01.040> using

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
want a really slick style so I'm using

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.609 
want a really slick style so I'm using
this<00:02:01.460> cortex<00:02:02.060> Flatiron<00:02:02.570> just<00:02:03.110> at<00:02:03.290> the<00:02:03.409> root

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
this cortex Flatiron just at the root

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.190 
this cortex Flatiron just at the root
and<00:02:03.829> that's<00:02:04.490> because<00:02:04.939> the<00:02:05.329> heat<00:02:05.540> is<00:02:05.689> so<00:02:05.960> high

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
and that's because the heat is so high

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.229 
and that's because the heat is so high
that<00:02:06.229> I<00:02:06.590> prefer<00:02:06.920> not<00:02:07.070> to<00:02:07.130> use<00:02:07.250> it<00:02:07.549> all<00:02:07.729> over<00:02:08.119> my

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
that I prefer not to use it all over my

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:09.699 
that I prefer not to use it all over my
hair<00:02:08.479> and<00:02:08.660> just<00:02:08.959> at<00:02:09.079> the<00:02:09.110> root<00:02:09.380> because<00:02:09.530> it

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
hair and just at the root because it

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.280 
hair and just at the root because it
gets<00:02:09.860> my<00:02:10.040> roots<00:02:10.250> very<00:02:10.489> nicely<00:02:11.000> and<00:02:11.420> then<00:02:12.079> for

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
gets my roots very nicely and then for

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.740 
gets my roots very nicely and then for
the<00:02:12.350> rest<00:02:12.530> of<00:02:12.620> my<00:02:12.769> hair<00:02:12.799> I<00:02:13.040> just<00:02:13.790> chased<00:02:14.480> my

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
the rest of my hair I just chased my

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.920 
the rest of my hair I just chased my
comb<00:02:15.049> with<00:02:15.410> my<00:02:15.620> t3<00:02:16.340> single<00:02:17.030> pass<00:02:17.209> iron<00:02:17.570> and<00:02:17.870> I

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
comb with my t3 single pass iron and I

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.090 
comb with my t3 single pass iron and I
go<00:02:18.049> through<00:02:18.290> my<00:02:18.350> hair<00:02:18.620> at<00:02:18.680> once

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
go through my hair at once

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.650 
go through my hair at once
so<00:02:19.700> I'm<00:02:19.760> just<00:02:19.880> going<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.090> be<00:02:20.150> repeating<00:02:20.570> this

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
so I'm just going to be repeating this

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.449 
so I'm just going to be repeating this
process<00:02:20.870> all<00:02:21.230> over<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.530> hair<00:02:21.709> it<00:02:21.860> seems<00:02:22.100> very

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
process all over the hair it seems very

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.759 
process all over the hair it seems very
tedious<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:23.180> it<00:02:23.269> is<00:02:23.420> but<00:02:24.019> it<00:02:24.049> gets<00:02:24.380> me<00:02:24.620> the

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
tedious and it is but it gets me the

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.470 
tedious and it is but it gets me the
best<00:02:24.950> results<00:02:25.070> without<00:02:25.640> having<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.150> go<00:02:26.239> to<00:02:26.269> the

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
best results without having to go to the

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.120 
best results without having to go to the
salon<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:26.840> it's<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.350> lot<00:02:27.500> more<00:02:27.650> gentle<00:02:28.100> because

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
salon and it's a lot more gentle because

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.250 
salon and it's a lot more gentle because
I<00:02:28.489> can<00:02:28.670> control<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.180> temperature<00:02:29.390> of<00:02:29.930> the

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
I can control the temperature of the

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.990 
I can control the temperature of the
black<00:02:30.410> and<00:02:30.680> white<00:02:30.769> iron<00:02:31.070> but<00:02:31.430> I<00:02:31.459> can't<00:02:31.760> control

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
black and white iron but I can't control

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.569 
black and white iron but I can't control
the<00:02:32.150> temperature<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.660> cortex<00:02:33.230> so<00:02:34.100> I<00:02:34.160> have

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
the temperature of that cortex so I have

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.830 
the temperature of that cortex so I have
the<00:02:35.000> black<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:36.049> white<00:02:36.170> iron<00:02:36.410> at<00:02:36.799> about<00:02:37.840> 360

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
the black and white iron at about 360

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.470 
the black and white iron at about 360
degrees<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.470> that<00:02:40.220> purple<00:02:40.609> iron<00:02:40.790> goes<00:02:41.180> to

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
degrees and that purple iron goes to

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.599 
degrees and that purple iron goes to
about<00:02:41.739> 400<00:02:42.739> so<00:02:42.980> I<00:02:43.010> don't<00:02:43.190> like<00:02:43.310> that<00:02:43.430> all<00:02:43.579> over

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:43.609 
about 400 so I don't like that all over

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:45.940 
about 400 so I don't like that all over
my<00:02:43.820> hair<00:02:44.090> but<00:02:44.359> what<00:02:45.049> I'm<00:02:45.140> doing<00:02:45.410> for<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.680> front

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
my hair but what I'm doing for the front

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.150 
my hair but what I'm doing for the front
of<00:02:46.010> my<00:02:46.070> hair<00:02:46.430> is<00:02:46.640> I'm<00:02:46.970> basically<00:02:47.750> just<00:02:48.160> curling

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
of my hair is I'm basically just curling

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.310 
of my hair is I'm basically just curling
my<00:02:49.459> hair<00:02:49.489> under<00:02:50.060> with<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.810> flick<00:02:51.019> of<00:02:51.140> my<00:02:51.170> wrist

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.229 
my hair under with the flick of my wrist

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
with the iron so I'm just basically

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.720 
with the iron so I'm just basically
twirling<00:02:53.810> my<00:02:53.930> iron<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.470> give<00:02:54.620> me<00:02:54.769> some<00:02:55.459> soft

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
twirling my iron to give me some soft

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.099 
twirling my iron to give me some soft
curls<00:02:56.090> that<00:02:56.299> will<00:02:56.390> give<00:02:56.540> me<00:02:56.660> a<00:02:56.690> little<00:02:56.810> bit<00:02:56.989> of
