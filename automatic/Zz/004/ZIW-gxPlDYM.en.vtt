00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.320
 hello my little guardians and 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.269
 guardians how are you welcome to 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.309
 a new video to define even today 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:15.219
 I have prepared a video where I want 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:18.189
 finally show you the emblems and 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.410
 shaders that have just arrived from the 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.360
 promotion that there was of Nepal as you see 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.670
 right now I just put them here in 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.320
 screen what good is ketchup what 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.270
 combined here the three characters at 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.840
 maximum level and with the emblem this 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:34.210
 blue and red supersweet or spider meant 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.340
 Well first I'll teach you to 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.290
 those that you have acquired this so that 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.810
 this I remember you was in the month of 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.790
 May when they did the promotion for 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.860
 help Nepal for the issue of 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.160
 catastrophes that there were in that area and 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.200
 You could contribute a quantity of 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.540
 good and in return they sent you a 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.399
 T-shirt and now, as I tell you, 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.980
 the codes have just arrived or better 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.660
 told the code to already have the shader 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.100
 and to also have this emblem as 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.629
 Well say so cocky when 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.950
 the code comes and the exchange is what 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.049
 you will have to do will be coming here to 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.640
 this terminal you already know that you should 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.380
 is on vacation well then here in the 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.950
 top we find the shader 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.509
 nepal prayer and in the part 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.939
 lower we will find the emblem 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:15.229
 good nepal pride for now if you 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.670
 it seems we are going to do here a pass of 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.110
 I'm going to show you how they are 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.490
 these shaders in all my characters 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.079
 so be prepared that we started well 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.390
 Well here I present my sorceress 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:28.399
 clear favorite I have no other and if you 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.789
 it seems I will first make a 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:34.789
 rotation for you to try and you can see 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:36.380
 all the details good plus what 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.020
 we do accompanied by a sexy dance 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.420
 which is always good because then you 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.310
 I will also show the menu 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.110
 character so that you can also 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.819
 appreciate all the details first 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.849
 I'll give a little spin here too 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:52.099
 and then I'll show you each one 

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:53.569
 of the different pieces taking advantage 

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:55.360
 that we have the new function you already know 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:57.409
 of being able to rotate each piece of armor 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.060
 individually so let's do what 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.679
 same here sees go how is this 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.270
 hood of the exiled the truth that 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:03.860
 when we do this we can appreciate 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.049
 all the little details you even see those 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.179
 marks that are in the helmet to me 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.940
 personally, I like this shader 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.079
 apart from having that exclusivity me 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.450
 also like the brightness is that to me 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:15.240
 well in fact you do not know but the red 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.580
 It is one 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.650
 my favorite colors the other I'm not going 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.420
 to say because I'll leave it for the 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.590
 questions and answers that are already me 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.690
 asking that I'm already thinking about 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.170
 do it but well we return to the case here 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.700
 come on the chest armor too os 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.620
 I'm going to show the boots so that 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.600
 you see and well as I tell you the truth that 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.600
 it combines very well the tone this blue and 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.450
 red is a bit like it said before halo 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.010
 halo spiderman in a certain way and good 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.250
 Well now if you think we're going to pass 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.430
 also to see how is this shader 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:51.060
 in my favorite windbreaker I do not have 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.310
 another and good as I told you 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.960
 It depends a lot on the piece of armor 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.790
 that it has put and some pieces then 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.320
 that stand out more others stand out less 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.420
 but he was doing some 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.660
 tests and well these have been the ones 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.820
 maybe I liked it more and I thought 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.770
 also that it was worth it then 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.990
 will highlight those little details and that 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.730
 highlight as much as possible so that 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.800
 could appreciate in its maximum splendor 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.770
 good as you see here we are rotating the 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.030
 helmet now let's do the same with 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.130
 the gloves 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.840
 what do you think the truth that especially 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.760
 As I tell you, the subject of brightness 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.430
 I really like how that detail is 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.370
 is very successful and now we are going to 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.900
 move on to the chest armor we're going to 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.970
 do here also the full rotation 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.400
 good although here also really 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.120
 the gauntlets also do not appear but 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.560
 good unless arms are so 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.170
 lowered and allow us to see then the 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.910
 chest armor with its maximum detail 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.470
 and here we have the boots of the exiled 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.120
 that are also very cool because 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.709
 As you can see, it combines very well with the three 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.209
 colors with blue with white and with 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.459
 the red good because I only have left 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.220
 show you my favorite titan now now 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:59.680
 I 'm not going to say it and as you can see, this is 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.300
 armor of osiris is pretty good 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.370
 also has those little details in black 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.250
 that's good particularly as they combine 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.750
 to my taste very well with red and now 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.640
 Well, I'm going to show you this helm 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.290
 exiled it happens a bit like the helmet 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.330
 that has shown the sorcerer to 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.640
 principle that you see in all the notches 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.190
 and that gives it a pretty air 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.560
 realistically like there's been a thousand 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.090
 battles that is seasoned we go and good 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.620
 Well now he showed them the gauntlets 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.090
 they also look pretty good 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.389
 I commented before the glitters in these 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.199
 pieces 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:30.669
 I think they are very well done 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:33.249
 now we are seeing the armor of 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.259
 chest as I said to you because it depends on 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:36.999
 each one of how you go combining 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:38.710
 it has an effect has another and here 

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:40.749
 we have the boots that you see combine 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.210
 very well with the blue background color of 

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:44.740
 pants and now I would miss only 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.830
 do the rotation I'm going to show it 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.289
 here in the inventory menu all the 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.020
 full rotation and nothing else here 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:54.699
 the video because I hope that I have 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.889
 It seemed interesting that you liked it 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:59.199
 you already know how to get this shader and 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.849
 this emblem in case you see it out there 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:03.009
 my part, I'm just gothic and see you 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:06.029
 in the next video with a triple dance 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:06.029
 I say goodbye goodbye
