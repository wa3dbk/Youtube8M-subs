it was installed no nails so it's very
easy<00:01:54.340> to<00:01:54.520> take<00:01:54.670> apart<00:01:55.060> and<00:01:55.750> it's<00:01:55.899> actually<00:01:56.319> in

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
easy to take apart and it's actually in

D how much of that comes into this
facility<00:02:36.719> every<00:02:37.260> day<00:02:37.579> 250<00:02:38.579> ton<00:02:38.819> quite<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.569> bit

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
facility every day 250 ton quite a bit

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.770 
facility every day 250 ton quite a bit
and<00:02:40.200> of<00:02:40.469> that<00:02:40.709> 250<00:02:41.459> tons<00:02:41.700> what<00:02:42.269> percent<00:02:42.629> do<00:02:42.719> you

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
and of that 250 tons what percent do you

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.330 
and of that 250 tons what percent do you
think<00:02:42.989> it's<00:02:43.140> recycled<00:02:43.739> or<00:02:43.829> reused

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.589 

all<00:02:47.610> right<00:02:47.730> so<00:02:47.849> it<00:02:47.910> looks<00:02:47.970> like<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.270> starts

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
all right so it looks like it starts

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.180 
all right so it looks like it starts

that's<00:02:50.819> correct<00:02:51.090> this<00:02:51.269> is<00:02:51.450> just<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.840> typical

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
that's correct this is just a typical

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.229 
that's correct this is just a typical
load<00:02:52.500> coming<00:02:52.950> in<00:02:53.069> off<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.250> construction<00:02:53.970> site

load coming in off a construction site
that's<00:02:54.629> all<00:02:54.900> sorts<00:02:55.440> of<00:02:55.500> things<00:02:55.769> in<00:02:56.040> here

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
that's all sorts of things in here

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.399 
that's all sorts of things in here
and<00:02:57.129> obviously<00:02:58.030> be<00:02:58.299> dumped<00:02:58.689> here<00:02:58.810> into<00:02:59.110> a<00:02:59.140> big

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409 
and obviously be dumped here into a big

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.550 
and obviously be dumped here into a big
pile<00:02:59.909> what's<00:03:00.909> the<00:03:01.030> process<00:03:01.299> well<00:03:02.079> first<00:03:02.379> of

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
pile what's the process well first of

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.740 
pile what's the process well first of
all<00:03:02.709> most<00:03:03.459> of<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.790> material<00:03:04.239> that<00:03:04.269> you<00:03:04.510> see

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
all most of the material that you see

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.690 
all most of the material that you see
here<00:03:04.989> is<00:03:05.230> going<00:03:05.260> into<00:03:05.799> the<00:03:05.980> system<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.489> system

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
here is going into the system the system

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.240 
here is going into the system the system
very<00:03:07.180> automated<00:03:07.870> and<00:03:08.230> will<00:03:08.409> handle<00:03:08.799> that<00:03:08.950> as

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
very automated and will handle that as

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.309 
very automated and will handle that as
it<00:03:09.430> is<00:03:09.579> but<00:03:10.120> there<00:03:10.269> is<00:03:10.390> a<00:03:10.420> presort

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
it is but there is a presort

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.039 
it is but there is a presort
and<00:03:11.500> it's<00:03:11.670> stage<00:03:12.670> that<00:03:13.030> we<00:03:13.150> do<00:03:13.420> a<00:03:13.450> couple<00:03:13.959> of

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
and it's stage that we do a couple of

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.380 
and it's stage that we do a couple of
different<00:03:14.110> things<00:03:14.590> such<00:03:14.829> as<00:03:14.860> one<00:03:15.819> is<00:03:16.030> we<00:03:16.269> need

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
different things such as one is we need

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.210 
different things such as one is we need
to<00:03:16.569> take<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.900> material<00:03:17.049> that<00:03:17.440> we<00:03:17.620> want<00:03:17.890> such

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
to take the material that we want such

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.810 
to take the material that we want such
as<00:03:18.370> wood<00:03:18.670> to<00:03:18.909> break<00:03:19.209> it<00:03:19.390> to<00:03:19.510> a<00:03:19.540> size

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.090 

bringing<00:03:25.870> pokey<00:03:26.870> materials<00:03:27.410> such<00:03:27.680> as<00:03:27.710> glass

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
bringing pokey materials such as glass

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.510 
bringing pokey materials such as glass
there<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:30.170> thing<00:03:30.620> you<00:03:30.740> don't<00:03:30.890> want<00:03:31.160> going

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
there the thing you don't want going

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.250 
there the thing you don't want going
into<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:31.880> automated<00:03:32.330> machine

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
into the automated machine

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.649 
into the automated machine
next<00:03:33.890> step<00:03:34.069> it<00:03:34.220> goes<00:03:34.370> from<00:03:34.550> here<00:03:34.909> onto<00:03:35.569> the

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:35.659 
next step it goes from here onto the

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:40.000 
next step it goes from here onto the
conveyor<00:03:36.080> and<00:03:36.319> into<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.769> system

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.740 

so<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:40.340> second<00:03:40.730> step<00:03:40.819> starts<00:03:41.330> here<00:03:41.510> in<00:03:41.629> this

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
so the second step starts here in this

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.509 
so the second step starts here in this
excavator<00:03:42.230> picking<00:03:42.680> it<00:03:42.800> out<00:03:42.890> of<00:03:43.069> pile<00:03:43.310> and

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
excavator picking it out of pile and

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.380 
excavator picking it out of pile and
drop<00:03:43.760> it<00:03:43.909> on<00:03:44.120> to<00:03:44.360> a<00:03:44.390> conveyor<00:03:45.140> belt

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
drop it on to a conveyor belt

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.660 
drop it on to a conveyor belt
this<00:03:46.720> conveyor<00:03:47.200> carries<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.920> material<00:03:48.460> up

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
this conveyor carries the material up

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.330 
this conveyor carries the material up
into<00:03:48.819> our<00:03:49.090> trommel<00:03:49.650> trommel<00:03:50.650> that's<00:03:50.920> that<00:03:51.100> big

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
into our trommel trommel that's that big

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.670 
into our trommel trommel that's that big
spinning<00:03:51.760> drum<00:03:52.060> up<00:03:52.240> there<00:03:52.450> that's<00:03:53.020> a<00:03:53.140> series

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
spinning drum up there that's a series

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.260 
spinning drum up there that's a series
of<00:03:53.709> streams<00:03:54.340> that<00:03:54.610> short<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.360> material<00:03:57.240> so<00:03:58.240> I

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
of streams that short the material so I

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.750 
of streams that short the material so I
can<00:03:58.600> see<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:58.990> conveyor<00:03:59.380> belt<00:03:59.680> at<00:03:59.830> the<00:03:59.860> far<00:04:00.250> end

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
can see the conveyor belt at the far end

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.460 
can see the conveyor belt at the far end
feeding<00:04:01.240> the<00:04:01.360> trommel<00:04:01.840> I<00:04:01.930> guess<00:04:02.080> the<00:04:02.200> small

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
feeding the trommel I guess the small

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.650 
feeding the trommel I guess the small
stuff<00:04:02.740> goes<00:04:02.950> to<00:04:03.100> that<00:04:03.220> first<00:04:03.459> stream<00:04:03.820> and<00:04:04.450> then

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
stuff goes to that first stream and then

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.390 
stuff goes to that first stream and then
these<00:04:04.780> larger<00:04:05.290> holes<00:04:05.500> here<00:04:05.890> that's<00:04:06.160> the

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
these larger holes here that's the

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.199 
these larger holes here that's the
second<00:04:06.760> screen

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
second screen

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.030 
second screen
that's<00:04:07.390> correct<00:04:07.720> Kevin<00:04:08.080> that's<00:04:08.170> a<00:04:08.380> 12<00:04:08.709> inch

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
that's correct Kevin that's a 12 inch

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.640 
that's correct Kevin that's a 12 inch
three<00:04:09.550> and<00:04:09.790> what<00:04:10.600> happens<00:04:11.020> in<00:04:11.110> the<00:04:11.170> material

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
three and what happens in the material

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.170 
three and what happens in the material
that<00:04:11.680> doesn't<00:04:12.100> go<00:04:12.400> through<00:04:12.610> the<00:04:12.730> 12<00:04:13.000> inch

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
that doesn't go through the 12 inch

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.360 
that doesn't go through the 12 inch
strain<00:04:13.480> that<00:04:13.930> carries<00:04:14.470> through<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:14.860> trommel

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
strain that carries through the trommel

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.400 
strain that carries through the trommel
unto<00:04:15.700> another<00:04:16.000> conveyor<00:04:16.419> belt<00:04:16.720> and<00:04:17.019> into<00:04:17.290> the

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
unto another conveyor belt and into the

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.380 
unto another conveyor belt and into the
main<00:04:17.680> picking<00:04:18.250> cell<00:04:18.489> and<00:04:18.880> the<00:04:19.060> smaller

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
main picking cell and the smaller

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.849 
main picking cell and the smaller
material<00:04:19.840> that<00:04:19.959> does<00:04:20.169> go<00:04:20.380> through<00:04:20.560> the<00:04:20.620> 12

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
material that does go through the 12

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.070 
material that does go through the 12
inch<00:04:21.040> street<00:04:21.280> that<00:04:21.700> Jerry's<00:04:22.210> out<00:04:22.390> into<00:04:22.750> an<00:04:22.900> air

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
inch street that Jerry's out into an air

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.590 
inch street that Jerry's out into an air
system<00:04:23.410> then<00:04:24.190> into<00:04:24.460> a<00:04:24.490> water<00:04:24.880> system<00:04:25.419> where

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
system then into a water system where

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.310 
system then into a water system where
it's<00:04:25.750> where<00:04:26.020> they're<00:04:26.230> separated<00:04:28.140> so<00:04:29.140> you've

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
it's where they're separated so you've

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.990 
it's where they're separated so you've
got<00:04:29.500> to<00:04:29.650> shove<00:04:29.890> another<00:04:30.070> station<00:04:30.760> where<00:04:30.910> you

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
got to shove another station where you

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.030 
got to shove another station where you
actually<00:04:31.150> use<00:04:31.360> water<00:04:31.870> to<00:04:32.020> separate<00:04:32.590> the<00:04:32.770> trash

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
actually use water to separate the trash

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.100 
actually use water to separate the trash
that's<00:04:33.790> correct<00:04:34.150> what<00:04:34.450> comes<00:04:34.690> in<00:04:34.840> on<00:04:34.990> the

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
that's correct what comes in on the

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.440 
that's correct what comes in on the
conveyor<00:04:35.470> belt<00:04:35.500> drops<00:04:36.160> into<00:04:36.430> the<00:04:36.520> water<00:04:36.820> and

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
conveyor belt drops into the water and

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.050 
conveyor belt drops into the water and
what<00:04:37.840> floats<00:04:38.200> carries<00:04:39.160> across<00:04:39.310> under<00:04:39.940> this

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
what floats carries across under this

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.330 
what floats carries across under this
conveyor<00:04:40.480> belt<00:04:40.750> so<00:04:41.410> we've<00:04:41.770> got<00:04:41.950> some<00:04:42.130> of<00:04:42.160> the

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
conveyor belt so we've got some of the

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.030 
conveyor belt so we've got some of the
obvious<00:04:42.760> stuff<00:04:42.940> we've<00:04:43.840> got<00:04:44.020> wood<00:04:44.320> there's

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
obvious stuff we've got wood there's

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.070 
obvious stuff we've got wood there's
some<00:04:45.220> random<00:04:45.640> plastic<00:04:45.880> I've<00:04:46.360> gotten<00:04:46.720> in<00:04:46.840> there

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
some random plastic I've gotten in there

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.030 
some random plastic I've gotten in there
spits<00:04:48.010> up<00:04:48.190> look<00:04:48.990> what<00:04:49.990> happens<00:04:50.470> to<00:04:50.650> this<00:04:50.770> stuff

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
spits up look what happens to this stuff

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.630 
spits up look what happens to this stuff
that<00:04:51.340> doesn't<00:04:51.610> flow<00:04:52.140> everything<00:04:53.140> else<00:04:53.640> sinks

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
that doesn't flow everything else sinks

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.180 
that doesn't flow everything else sinks
through<00:04:55.120> the<00:04:55.330> water<00:04:55.570> and<00:04:55.990> onto<00:04:56.200> a<00:04:56.380> conveyor

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
through the water and onto a conveyor

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.280 
through the water and onto a conveyor
belt<00:04:57.490> which<00:04:57.940> is<00:04:58.120> carried<00:04:58.540> up<00:04:58.660> to<00:04:58.900> this<00:04:59.020> point

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
belt which is carried up to this point

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.560 
belt which is carried up to this point
and<00:04:59.979> so<00:05:00.220> in<00:05:00.370> here<00:05:00.580> I<00:05:00.610> can<00:05:00.940> see<00:05:01.120> that<00:05:01.240> we've<00:05:01.390> got

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
and so in here I can see that we've got

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.240 
and so in here I can see that we've got
the<00:05:01.720> mass<00:05:01.900> fall<00:05:02.290> we'll<00:05:02.680> take<00:05:02.860> some<00:05:03.010> concrete

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
the mass fall we'll take some concrete

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.700 
the mass fall we'll take some concrete
there<00:05:03.760> some<00:05:04.510> metal<00:05:04.840> pieces<00:05:05.050> where<00:05:05.470> is<00:05:05.590> this

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
there some metal pieces where is this

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:06.860 
there some metal pieces where is this
going

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
going

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.960 
going
years<00:05:07.350> it's<00:05:07.650> going<00:05:07.860> to<00:05:08.070> a<00:05:08.100> magnet<00:05:08.700> where<00:05:08.850> all

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
years it's going to a magnet where all

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.719 
years it's going to a magnet where all
the<00:05:09.120> ferrous<00:05:09.540> metals<00:05:09.960> of

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
the ferrous metals of

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:12.670 
the ferrous metals of
then<00:05:11.270> into<00:05:11.539> the<00:05:11.569> cabin<00:05:12.169> where<00:05:12.349> it's<00:05:12.469> all

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
then into the cabin where it's all

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.710 
then into the cabin where it's all
hands-on

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.270 

so<00:05:17.080> this<00:05:17.230> is<00:05:17.380> the<00:05:17.470> labor-intensive<00:05:18.190> part

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
so this is the labor-intensive part

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.130 
so this is the labor-intensive part
where<00:05:18.430> everything's<00:05:18.700> picked<00:05:18.940> by<00:05:19.090> hands<00:05:19.540> yes

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
where everything's picked by hands yes

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.320 
where everything's picked by hands yes
it<00:05:20.350> is<00:05:20.470> this<00:05:20.770> is<00:05:20.920> where<00:05:21.130> everything<00:05:21.880> ends<00:05:22.090> up

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
it is this is where everything ends up

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.000 
it is this is where everything ends up
that<00:05:22.510> didn't<00:05:22.870> go<00:05:22.990> through<00:05:23.200> the<00:05:23.350> screens<00:05:23.710> of

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
that didn't go through the screens of

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.920 
that didn't go through the screens of
the<00:05:24.040> trouble<00:05:24.580> so<00:05:25.000> this<00:05:25.150> is<00:05:25.270> all<00:05:25.450> of<00:05:25.630> the<00:05:25.720> big

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
the trouble so this is all of the big

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.270 
the trouble so this is all of the big
debris<00:05:26.260> and<00:05:26.410> I<00:05:26.560> can<00:05:26.740> see<00:05:26.890> these<00:05:26.980> guys<00:05:27.040> are

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
debris and I can see these guys are

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.640 
debris and I can see these guys are
actually<00:05:27.520> grabbing<00:05:28.120> it<00:05:28.240> goes<00:05:29.020> into<00:05:29.260> various

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
actually grabbing it goes into various

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.530 
actually grabbing it goes into various
bins<00:05:29.920> you've<00:05:30.190> got<00:05:30.340> one<00:05:30.550> here<00:05:30.790> for<00:05:30.820> wood<00:05:31.240> and

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
bins you've got one here for wood and

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.480 
bins you've got one here for wood and
one<00:05:31.720> for<00:05:31.960> metal<00:05:32.260> how<00:05:32.920> about<00:05:33.100> everything<00:05:33.340> that

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
one for metal how about everything that

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.210 
one for metal how about everything that
went<00:05:33.790> through<00:05:34.090> the<00:05:34.210> water<00:05:34.480> sorting<00:05:35.080> back<00:05:35.260> that

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
went through the water sorting back that

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.070 
went through the water sorting back that
ends<00:05:36.580> up<00:05:36.670> on<00:05:36.820> this<00:05:36.970> picking<00:05:37.390> station<00:05:37.840> over

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
ends up on this picking station over

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.230 
ends up on this picking station over
here<00:05:38.110> this<00:05:38.440> is<00:05:38.500> results<00:05:39.490> with<00:05:39.640> the<00:05:39.760> floatable

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
here this is results with the floatable

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.030 
here this is results with the floatable
so<00:05:40.660> this<00:05:40.810> is<00:05:40.930> all<00:05:41.080> the<00:05:41.260> wooden<00:05:41.470> stuff<00:05:41.770> and<00:05:41.920> what

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.040 
so this is all the wooden stuff and what

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.500 
so this is all the wooden stuff and what
are<00:05:42.130> they<00:05:42.220> picking<00:05:42.400> off<00:05:42.700> and<00:05:43.210> they're<00:05:43.360> picking

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
are they picking off and they're picking

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.150 
are they picking off and they're picking
off<00:05:43.750> some<00:05:43.780> of<00:05:43.990> this<00:05:44.140> is<00:05:44.320> ham<00:05:44.530> and<00:05:44.740> and<00:05:44.830> such<00:05:45.010> as

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
off some of this is ham and and such as

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.640 
off some of this is ham and and such as
plastic<00:05:45.850> and<00:05:46.120> paper<00:05:46.330> and<00:05:47.140> then<00:05:47.230> every<00:05:47.410> once<00:05:47.530> in

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
plastic and paper and then every once in

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:48.990 
plastic and paper and then every once in
a<00:05:47.740> while<00:05:47.920> I<00:05:47.950> can<00:05:48.070> see<00:05:48.340> it's<00:05:48.490> going<00:05:48.640> to<00:05:48.760> would

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
a while I can see it's going to would

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.790 
a while I can see it's going to would
you<00:05:49.570> know<00:05:49.690> another<00:05:49.930> bin<00:05:50.140> here<00:05:50.290> labeled<00:05:50.620> wood

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
you know another bin here labeled wood

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.980 
you know another bin here labeled wood
and<00:05:51.130> the<00:05:51.430> stuff<00:05:51.700> that<00:05:51.910> didn't<00:05:52.270> float<00:05:52.660> is<00:05:52.840> that

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
and the stuff that didn't float is that

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.510 
and the stuff that didn't float is that
what's<00:05:53.170> coming<00:05:53.410> into<00:05:53.560> the<00:05:53.710> bar<00:05:53.950> conveyor<00:05:54.280> belt

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
what's coming into the bar conveyor belt

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.400 
what's coming into the bar conveyor belt
that's<00:05:55.120> what's<00:05:55.330> coming<00:05:55.480> in<00:05:55.750> over<00:05:55.990> there<00:05:56.170> and

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410 
that's what's coming in over there and

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.970 
that's what's coming in over there and
then<00:05:56.560> being<00:05:56.800> hit

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:00.980 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.530 

so<00:06:01.980> this<00:06:02.130> is<00:06:02.250> where<00:06:02.430> it<00:06:02.550> ends<00:06:02.730> up<00:06:02.880> sorted<00:06:03.420> in

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540 
so this is where it ends up sorted in

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.930 
so this is where it ends up sorted in
all<00:06:03.720> these<00:06:03.900> separate<00:06:04.260> bins<00:06:04.500> so<00:06:05.490> it<00:06:05.610> does<00:06:05.790> as

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
all these separate bins so it does as

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.670 
all these separate bins so it does as
you<00:06:06.060> can<00:06:06.180> see<00:06:06.360> it's<00:06:06.510> a<00:06:06.600> pretty<00:06:06.630> clean<00:06:07.140> product

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
you can see it's a pretty clean product

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.920 
you can see it's a pretty clean product
we<00:06:07.830> have<00:06:08.040> here<00:06:08.340> the<00:06:08.850> wood<00:06:09.030> is<00:06:09.180> used<00:06:09.390> as<00:06:09.600> fuel

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
we have here the wood is used as fuel

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.220 
we have here the wood is used as fuel
and<00:06:10.290> it's<00:06:10.890> burned<00:06:11.160> to<00:06:11.400> create<00:06:11.700> electricity

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:12.230 
and it's burned to create electricity

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.810 
and it's burned to create electricity
how<00:06:13.230> about<00:06:13.440> the<00:06:13.650> metal<00:06:14.190> that's<00:06:14.430> going<00:06:14.670> to<00:06:14.730> go

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
how about the metal that's going to go

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.850 
how about the metal that's going to go
to<00:06:14.910> a<00:06:14.970> local<00:06:15.210> scrapyard<00:06:15.690> be<00:06:16.200> melted<00:06:16.620> down<00:06:16.800> and

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
to a local scrapyard be melted down and

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.400 
to a local scrapyard be melted down and
reuse<00:06:17.730> the<00:06:17.940> steel<00:06:18.240> I<00:06:18.540> bet<00:06:18.900> that<00:06:19.050> that's<00:06:19.110> pretty

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
reuse the steel I bet that that's pretty

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.380 
reuse the steel I bet that that's pretty
valuable<00:06:19.590> how<00:06:20.040> about<00:06:20.220> the<00:06:20.400> plastic<00:06:21.030> the

valuable how about the plastic the

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.900 
valuable how about the plastic the
plastics<00:06:21.900> we<00:06:22.050> bail<00:06:22.290> here<00:06:22.590> on<00:06:22.770> site<00:06:23.070> and<00:06:23.310> that

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:23.910 
plastics we bail here on site and that

the corrugated cardboard here corrugated
we<00:06:34.320> bail<00:06:34.560> here<00:06:34.830> on-site<00:06:35.220> as<00:06:35.460> well<00:06:35.730> that's

we bail here on-site as well that's

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.800 
we bail here on-site as well that's
reused<00:06:36.930> this<00:06:37.260> corrugated<00:06:37.980> boxes<00:06:38.450> at<00:06:39.450> the<00:06:39.570> same

reused this corrugated boxes at the same
this<00:06:40.200> is<00:06:40.350> probably<00:06:40.680> the<00:06:40.800> most<00:06:40.950> sophisticated

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:41.450 
this is probably the most sophisticated

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.730 
this is probably the most sophisticated
facility<00:06:42.450> I've<00:06:42.570> ever<00:06:42.750> been<00:06:42.930> to<00:06:43.110> it's

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
facility I've ever been to it's

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.370 
facility I've ever been to it's
certainly<00:06:43.950> one<00:06:44.340> of<00:06:44.370> the<00:06:44.520> most<00:06:44.670> automated

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:45.380 
certainly one of the most automated

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.660 
certainly one of the most automated
systems<00:06:46.380> in<00:06:46.560> the<00:06:46.650> country<00:06:46.830> so<00:06:47.400> do<00:06:47.550> you<00:06:47.610> think

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:47.670 
systems in the country so do you think

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:48.830 
systems in the country so do you think
this<00:06:47.970> is<00:06:48.090> the<00:06:48.120> wave<00:06:48.330> of<00:06:48.360> the<00:06:48.510> future

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 
this is the wave of the future

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.390 
this is the wave of the future
I<00:06:49.020> sure<00:06:49.470> do<00:06:49.680> certainly<00:06:50.130> here<00:06:50.370> in

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 
I sure do certainly here in

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.160 
I sure do certainly here in
Massachusetts<00:06:51.240> with<00:06:51.390> the<00:06:51.480> waistbands

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:52.170 
Massachusetts with the waistbands

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.200 
Massachusetts with the waistbands
but<00:06:52.560> also<00:06:52.740> throughout<00:06:53.160> the<00:06:53.310> country<00:06:53.850> it's

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:54.210 
but also throughout the country it's

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.659 
but also throughout the country it's
really<00:06:54.720> the<00:06:54.840> thing

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:55.669 
really the thing

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:57.070 
really the thing
well<00:06:56.090> thank<00:06:56.270> you<00:06:56.330> for<00:06:56.419> showing<00:06:56.539> us<00:06:56.689> around<00:06:56.810> -
