 eric the kitty 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:15.129
 gervinho at the bergerette 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.129
 crozon sin 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.460
 its peculiarity is that under a shady garden half place 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.169
 that led me to make decisions in the establishment of the garden 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:34.279
 we will do more research were the fires there is a game evolves 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.170
 leaf associations color associations in the air 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.310
 too many on is downright gerland 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.610
 I wanted an existing structure I did not want to start from a choice 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.890
 and for 100 th it's what happened here the oak on tuesday although chain 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.730
 called me when I arrived here 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.470
 this oak marks the entrance of the garden 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.400
 my goal 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.360
 primordial it was at least one really to draw for 100 m to apply 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.720
 measure my theory 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.360
 1 my garden that it was for her was also crazy and that's how 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.140
 I see it I had a 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.720
 fnsea trend 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.079
 a few years ago more attracted by the English garden 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:15.669
 and finally I got closer to the gardens of 

00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:17.280
 topiaries or French gardens 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.960
 oula really the intervention of the man is more important 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.780
 and it corresponded more to my personality finally 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.420
 I'm not a maniac I'm pretty meticulous so the garden is always 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.740
 also very neat 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.740
 I felt extremely good in my garden 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.020
 I spend a lot of time people find themselves a little in this style of 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.720
 gervinho 6% 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.250
 we but not overwhelmed 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.180
 well the kind is not too big% sees anyway that everything was 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.070
 maintained 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.890
 and percent

 italian by tourcoing 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.790
 there are some wear-free visitors and experts 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.030
 those who come who even have ideas to take here and that cc it's 

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:59.640
 important to give what will surely be said given the exchange was made 

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:02.760
 is done and it's important 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.920
 or a year ago 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.869
 a lot of people who told me it was a little piece of heaven and that 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.869
 it's really fun it's a little what I did not really want 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.709
 create a little corner of paradise where you feel very good
