00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:47.210

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:32.510
 just look waypoint megaman 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:35.450

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.890
 Of course I know I do not know how 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.120
 The village means I need one more 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.989

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.989
 alpha saved 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:54.760
 and then we just fly like that 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:03:06.430
 through the world and think back to it 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:06.430

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:25.459

 the landlord knocks euro to avoid detection 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.850
 I can always zoom out 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.290
 raussuchen 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.290
 this looks also highly intelligent from 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:59.430

00:03:49.670 --> 00:04:02.640

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:25.500
 especially since how can I do that 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:29.550
 Once again, josko will speed it up 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:33.990

00:04:38.360 --> 00:05:19.260
 no no no, because the city is 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:25.940
 destroyed that wanted what does the type 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:25.940

 populated there again a dog 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:06:15.090
 village inhabits my opinion 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:06:16.410
 villagers in the live stream because 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.450
 here the viewer on youtube is not 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.910
 we probably have to get it 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:23.010
 as soon as possible away from the city and 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:26.580
 we are ridden a brand new city 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:35.270

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.090

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:57.870
