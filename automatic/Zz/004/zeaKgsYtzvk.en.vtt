00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
sound and let you know where the monster

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.889 
sound and let you know where the monster
is<00:01:49.619> at<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:49.979> moment<00:01:50.220> he<00:01:50.970> can<00:01:51.090> also<00:01:51.240> deploy<00:01:51.600> a

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
is at that moment he can also deploy a

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.929 
is at that moment he can also deploy a
mobile<00:01:52.350> arena<00:01:52.710> which<00:01:53.100> traps<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.549> monster

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
mobile arena which traps the monster

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.749 
mobile arena which traps the monster
temporarily<00:01:54.390> under<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.869> energy<00:01:55.380> dome

quickly into the jungle the monster is
racing<00:02:23.389> to<00:02:23.480> evolve<00:02:23.900> himself<00:02:24.409> and<00:02:24.680> a<00:02:24.739> lot<00:02:24.889> more

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
racing to evolve himself and a lot more

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.920 
racing to evolve himself and a lot more
of<00:02:25.340> his<00:02:25.459> ability<00:02:25.879> so<00:02:26.150> that<00:02:26.299> it's<00:02:26.420> easier<00:02:26.749> for

which is the highest form of evolution
at<00:02:57.379> that<00:02:57.530> point<00:02:57.769> you<00:02:57.859> become<00:02:58.010> a<00:02:58.159> real<00:02:58.459> threat

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
to adapt and adjust the other thing that

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.070 
to adapt and adjust the other thing that
I<00:04:49.950> like<00:04:50.100> is<00:04:50.250> it<00:04:50.370> keeps<00:04:51.090> left<00:04:51.870> 4<00:04:52.050> dead

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
I like is it keeps left 4 dead

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.650 
I like is it keeps left 4 dead
simplicity<00:04:52.890> so<00:04:53.460> when<00:04:53.910> you<00:04:54.000> select<00:04:54.210> the<00:04:54.450> class

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
simplicity so when you select the class

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.180 
simplicity so when you select the class
there's<00:04:54.990> no<00:04:55.230> sort<00:04:55.590> of<00:04:55.650> going<00:04:55.860> through

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
there's no sort of going through

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.980 
there's no sort of going through
inventory<00:04:56.430> of<00:04:56.760> different<00:04:57.060> guns<00:04:57.240> or<00:04:57.570> abilities

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
inventory of different guns or abilities

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.530 
inventory of different guns or abilities
and<00:04:58.140> there's<00:04:58.290> no<00:04:58.470> real<00:04:59.250> major<00:04:59.610> customization

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
and there's no real major customization

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.300 
and there's no real major customization
you<00:05:00.690> know<00:05:00.930> your<00:05:01.170> role<00:05:01.380> and<00:05:01.620> you're<00:05:01.890> drawn<00:05:02.280> to

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
you know your role and you're drawn to

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.790 
you know your role and you're drawn to
do<00:05:02.790> it<00:05:03.000> as<00:05:03.120> well<00:05:03.150> as<00:05:03.600> possible<00:05:04.080> and<00:05:04.260> I<00:05:04.740> think

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
do it as well as possible and I think

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.170 
do it as well as possible and I think
that<00:05:05.040> makes<00:05:05.190> it<00:05:05.250> very<00:05:05.310> easy<00:05:05.460> to<00:05:05.730> jump<00:05:05.970> in

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
that makes it very easy to jump in

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.030 
that makes it very easy to jump in
without<00:05:06.510> feeling<00:05:06.960> intimidated<00:05:07.200> by<00:05:07.680> all<00:05:07.710> of

without feeling intimidated by all of
these<00:05:08.190> moving<00:05:08.550> parts<00:05:08.580> that<00:05:08.940> I<00:05:09.000> mentioned<00:05:13.430> it's

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
these moving parts that I mentioned it's

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.510 
these moving parts that I mentioned it's
a<00:05:14.550> surprisingly<00:05:14.910> complex<00:05:15.510> game<00:05:15.870> I<00:05:15.900> think<00:05:16.520> what

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
a surprisingly complex game I think what
