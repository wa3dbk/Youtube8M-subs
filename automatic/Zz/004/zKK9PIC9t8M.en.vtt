00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
proof of concept right now I'm recording

of focus right now so that you can see

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.500 
of focus right now so that you can see
the<00:00:21.840> screen<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:23.160> show<00:00:23.550> what<00:00:23.939> I'm<00:00:24.060> what<00:00:24.480> I'm

doing with this now the reason I'm doing
this<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.670> later<00:00:30.359> on<00:00:30.630> next<00:00:30.960> month<00:00:31.349> I'm

this is that later on next month I'm
going<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.710> be<00:00:31.769> comparing<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.489> scarlet<00:00:33.030> and

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
going to be comparing the scarlet and

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.120 
going to be comparing the scarlet and
the<00:00:33.329> GH<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.200> scarlet<00:00:34.620> finally<00:00:34.920> comes

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
the GH to and the scarlet finally comes

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.040 
the GH to and the scarlet finally comes
in<00:00:35.340> but<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:35.850> thought<00:00:36.059> I'd<00:00:36.210> show<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.450> how<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.809> get

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
in but I thought I'd show you how to get

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.990 
in but I thought I'd show you how to get
the<00:00:37.290> most<00:00:37.920> optimal<00:00:38.700> image<00:00:39.180> out<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:41.280> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
the most optimal image out of the the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.290 
the most optimal image out of the the
gh2<00:00:42.329> with<00:00:42.899> an<00:00:43.020> anamorphic<00:00:43.559> adapter<00:00:44.129> now<00:00:45.090> if

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
gh2 with an anamorphic adapter now if

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.630 
gh2 with an anamorphic adapter now if
we're<00:00:45.480> going<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:46.050> let<00:00:46.890> say<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.399> case

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
we're going to let say in this case

set<00:02:08.849> this<00:02:09.239> set<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.869> 4,000<00:02:10.679> by<00:02:10.879> 1800<00:02:11.879> which

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
set this set to 4,000 by 1800 which

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.590 
set this set to 4,000 by 1800 which
give<00:02:12.459> us<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:12.700> fairly<00:02:13.209> close<00:02:13.660> to<00:02:14.640> 4k<00:02:15.640> size

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
give us a fairly close to 4k size

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.010 
give us a fairly close to 4k size
project<00:02:17.110> that<00:02:17.260> we<00:02:17.350> can<00:02:17.500> upload<00:02:17.770> to<00:02:17.980> YouTube<00:02:19.020> so

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
project that we can upload to YouTube so

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.190 
project that we can upload to YouTube so
from<00:02:20.410> there<00:02:20.650> we<00:02:21.300> import<00:02:22.300> an<00:02:22.510> interpolator

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
from there we import an interpolator

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.320 
from there we import an interpolator
footage<00:02:23.620> which<00:02:24.220> you<00:02:24.370> can<00:02:24.490> see<00:02:24.700> here<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.209> I'll

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
footage which you can see here and I'll

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.960 
footage which you can see here and I'll
go<00:02:25.510> full<00:02:25.810> screen<00:02:26.170> with<00:02:26.319> that<00:02:28.260> nope<00:02:29.790> it's<00:02:30.790> gonna

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
go full screen with that nope it's gonna

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.660 
go full screen with that nope it's gonna
mess<00:02:31.180> up<00:02:31.360> because<00:02:31.840> I'm<00:02:32.110> going<00:02:32.380> to<00:02:32.890> put<00:02:33.489> it<00:02:33.580> on

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
mess up because I'm going to put it on

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.370 
mess up because I'm going to put it on
this<00:02:33.790> monitor<00:02:34.150> I'm<00:02:34.330> going<00:02:34.600> through<00:02:34.780> Splashtop

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
this monitor I'm going through Splashtop

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.940 
this monitor I'm going through Splashtop
through<00:02:35.590> in<00:02:35.709> another<00:02:36.180> system<00:02:37.180> but<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:40.950> better

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
through in another system but a better

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.020 
through in another system but a better
way<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.160> look<00:02:42.520> at<00:02:42.670> that<00:02:42.819> is<00:02:43.030> if<00:02:43.180> we<00:02:43.330> open<00:02:43.660> up<00:02:43.780> say

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
way to look at that is if we open up say

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.400 
way to look at that is if we open up say
Magic<00:02:46.030> Bullet<00:02:46.209> Looks<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:46.780> we<00:02:46.840> have<00:02:47.050> it<00:02:47.230> in

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
Magic Bullet Looks and we have it in

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:57.300 
Magic Bullet Looks and we have it in
here<00:02:48.310> I<00:02:49.470> found<00:02:50.470> that<00:02:50.830> for<00:02:53.130> 4k<00:02:54.130> and<00:02:56.310> resizing

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
here I found that for 4k and resizing

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.800 
here I found that for 4k and resizing
the<00:02:57.430> image<00:02:57.459> for<00:02:58.030> 4k<00:02:59.160> from<00:03:00.160> a<00:03:00.280> 1080p<00:03:00.810> master

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
the image for 4k from a 1080p master

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.720 
the image for 4k from a 1080p master
which<00:03:01.959> is<00:03:02.080> our<00:03:02.230> gh2<00:03:02.500> footage<00:03:03.010> in<00:03:03.190> anamorphic

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
which is our gh2 footage in anamorphic

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.270 
which is our gh2 footage in anamorphic
if<00:03:04.120> we<00:03:04.959> set<00:03:05.440> a<00:03:06.330> monochromatic<00:03:07.330> grain<00:03:07.870> size

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
if we set a monochromatic grain size

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.449 
if we set a monochromatic grain size
2.2%<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:10.239> grain<00:03:10.780> size<00:03:11.200> will<00:03:11.650> be<00:03:11.680> about<00:03:12.220> the

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
2.2% the grain size will be about the

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.229 
2.2% the grain size will be about the
size<00:03:12.700> of<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.269> pixels<00:03:13.750> and<00:03:13.989> it'll<00:03:14.200> kind<00:03:14.470> of<00:03:15.239> add

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
size of the pixels and it'll kind of add

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.100 
size of the pixels and it'll kind of add
noise<00:03:16.930> which<00:03:17.410> will<00:03:18.269> sort<00:03:19.269> of<00:03:19.450> give<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.900> image

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
noise which will sort of give the image

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.030 
noise which will sort of give the image
more<00:03:20.560> definition<00:03:21.400> when<00:03:22.060> it's<00:03:22.299> 3<00:03:23.260> downsampled

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
more definition when it's 3 downsampled

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.770 
more definition when it's 3 downsampled
so<00:03:24.160> that's<00:03:24.340> what<00:03:24.459> I<00:03:24.489> have<00:03:24.670> set<00:03:24.880> here<00:03:25.060> I've<00:03:25.269> got

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
so that's what I have set here I've got

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.080 
so that's what I have set here I've got
color<00:03:26.079> mode<00:03:26.320> off<00:03:26.530> for<00:03:26.890> film<00:03:27.100> grain<00:03:28.290> 2.2%<00:03:30.090> I've

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
color mode off for film grain 2.2% I've

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.020 
color mode off for film grain 2.2% I've
got<00:03:31.239> a<00:03:31.269> custom<00:03:31.900> through<00:03:32.170> a<00:03:32.760> color<00:03:33.760> corrector

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
got a custom through a color corrector

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.400 
got a custom through a color corrector
you<00:03:34.180> don't<00:03:34.329> need<00:03:34.450> to<00:03:34.510> worry<00:03:34.660> about<00:03:34.750> that<00:03:34.989> the

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
you don't need to worry about that the

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.750 
you don't need to worry about that the
other<00:03:35.530> thing<00:03:35.769> you<00:03:35.860> need<00:03:35.980> to<00:03:36.010> worry<00:03:36.280> about<00:03:36.340> is

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
other thing you need to worry about is

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.330 
other thing you need to worry about is
chromatic<00:03:37.690> amp<00:03:37.900> aberration<00:03:38.709> so<00:03:39.040> width<00:03:40.829> and<00:03:41.829> I

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
chromatic amp aberration so width and I

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.009 
chromatic amp aberration so width and I
think<00:03:42.640> you<00:03:42.760> can<00:03:42.880> see<00:03:43.060> that<00:03:43.239> wasn't<00:03:43.450> I<00:03:43.630> pointing

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
think you can see that wasn't I pointing

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.319 
think you can see that wasn't I pointing
over<00:03:44.140> yeah<00:03:44.650> chromatic<00:03:45.400> aberration<00:03:46.060> which<00:03:46.209> you

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
over yeah chromatic aberration which you

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.910 
over yeah chromatic aberration which you
can<00:03:46.480> see<00:03:46.690> right<00:03:46.720> in<00:03:47.440> this<00:03:48.010> section<00:03:48.310> right<00:03:48.670> here

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
can see right in this section right here

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.030 
can see right in this section right here
it's<00:03:50.920> one<00:03:51.070> of<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:51.250> options<00:03:51.670> and<00:03:51.820> tools<00:03:52.120> for

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
it's one of the options and tools for

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.400 
it's one of the options and tools for
the<00:03:54.660> Magic<00:03:55.660> Bullet<00:03:55.810> Looks

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
the Magic Bullet Looks

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.259 
the Magic Bullet Looks
so<00:03:57.600> we<00:03:58.600> can<00:03:58.810> use<00:03:59.459> chromatic<00:04:00.459> aberration<00:04:01.090> and

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
so we can use chromatic aberration and

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.039 
so we can use chromatic aberration and
we<00:04:01.329> can<00:04:01.450> actually<00:04:01.630> go<00:04:01.959> in<00:04:03.540> zoom<00:04:04.540> into<00:04:04.780> our

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
we can actually go in zoom into our

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.660 
we can actually go in zoom into our
image<00:04:05.850> are<00:04:06.850> now<00:04:07.060> 4k<00:04:07.510> image<00:04:07.780> and<00:04:07.989> we<00:04:08.079> can<00:04:08.230> fix

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
image are now 4k image and we can fix

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.819 
image are now 4k image and we can fix
any<00:04:09.670> edges<00:04:10.299> that<00:04:10.420> might<00:04:10.570> be<00:04:10.720> off<00:04:10.870> so<00:04:11.170> shooting

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
any edges that might be off so shooting

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.590 
any edges that might be off so shooting
this<00:04:11.980> with<00:04:12.130> a<00:04:12.190> 20<00:04:12.609> millimeter<00:04:12.910> lens<00:04:13.269> all<00:04:13.480> in

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
this with a 20 millimeter lens all in

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.900 
this with a 20 millimeter lens all in
this<00:04:13.720> case<00:04:13.900> a<00:04:13.959> 17<00:04:14.560> millimeter<00:04:14.769> lens<00:04:15.280> it's

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
this case a 17 millimeter lens it's

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.090 
this case a 17 millimeter lens it's
going<00:04:16.180> to<00:04:16.239> be<00:04:16.359> less<00:04:16.650> less<00:04:17.650> chromatic

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
going to be less less chromatic

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.770 
going to be less less chromatic
aberration<00:04:18.609> than<00:04:18.760> the<00:04:18.880> 20<00:04:19.150> millimeter<00:04:19.329> line

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
aberration than the 20 millimeter line

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.110 
aberration than the 20 millimeter line
so<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.049> further<00:04:20.650> the<00:04:21.010> focal<00:04:21.549> length<00:04:21.760> of<00:04:21.970> the

depends

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
depends

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.440 
depends
since<00:04:24.130> you're<00:04:24.280> cited<00:04:24.520> so<00:04:24.640> get<00:04:24.820> more<00:04:24.910> chromatic

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
since you're cited so get more chromatic

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.380 
since you're cited so get more chromatic
aberration<00:04:25.990> anyway<00:04:26.740> at<00:04:26.890> 4k<00:04:27.310> it's<00:04:27.820> really<00:04:28.180> easy

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
aberration anyway at 4k it's really easy

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.340 
aberration anyway at 4k it's really easy
to<00:04:28.720> actually<00:04:29.520> knock<00:04:30.520> that<00:04:30.790> out<00:04:30.850> by<00:04:31.350> adjusting

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
to actually knock that out by adjusting

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.710 
to actually knock that out by adjusting
the<00:04:32.500> values<00:04:32.860> for<00:04:33.130> red<00:04:33.160> and<00:04:33.520> cyan<00:04:33.760> blue<00:04:34.360> and

the values for red and cyan blue and
yellow<00:04:34.810> and<00:04:35.110> green<00:04:35.290> and<00:04:35.440> magenta<00:04:35.560> so<00:04:36.520> we<00:04:36.640> can

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
yellow and green and magenta so we can

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.870 
yellow and green and magenta so we can
fix<00:04:38.020> these<00:04:38.260> edges<00:04:38.710> like<00:04:38.920> this<00:04:39.190> so<00:04:39.490> let<00:04:39.670> me<00:04:39.730> zoom

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
fix these edges like this so let me zoom

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.880 
fix these edges like this so let me zoom
in<00:04:40.060> a<00:04:40.150> bit<00:04:40.180> more<00:04:40.420> so<00:04:40.660> you<00:04:40.720> can<00:04:40.780> take<00:04:41.260> a<00:04:41.290> look<00:04:41.740> at

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
in a bit more so you can take a look at

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:47.220 
in a bit more so you can take a look at
that<00:04:44.310> there's<00:04:45.310> just<00:04:45.940> maybe<00:04:46.120> a<00:04:46.300> hint<00:04:46.600> well<00:04:47.050> this

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
that there's just maybe a hint well this

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.410 
that there's just maybe a hint well this
is<00:04:47.350> a<00:04:47.410> perfect<00:04:47.800> time<00:04:47.950> you<00:04:48.760> can<00:04:48.880> see<00:04:49.060> that<00:04:49.240> I<00:04:49.270> can

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420 
is a perfect time you can see that I can

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.190 
is a perfect time you can see that I can
actually<00:04:49.900> adjust<00:04:49.990> and<00:04:50.680> fix<00:04:51.130> that<00:04:51.370> and<00:04:52.200> just

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
actually adjust and fix that and just

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.720 
actually adjust and fix that and just
like<00:04:53.380> I'll<00:04:53.530> do<00:04:53.650> for<00:04:53.830> this<00:04:53.950> video<00:04:54.370> before

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
like I'll do for this video before

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.550 
like I'll do for this video before
uploading<00:04:54.940> it<00:04:56.490> that's<00:04:57.490> essentially<00:04:58.330> a<00:04:58.600> fix

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
uploading it that's essentially a fix

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.680 
uploading it that's essentially a fix
that<00:04:59.860> will<00:04:59.980> give<00:05:00.100> you<00:05:00.190> a<00:05:00.250> better<00:05:00.460> image<00:05:00.700> with

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
that will give you a better image with

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.890 
that will give you a better image with
your<00:05:01.840> la<00:05:02.080> 7200<00:05:02.860> and<00:05:03.070> at<00:05:03.760> 4k<00:05:04.060> we've<00:05:04.480> got<00:05:04.690> more

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
your la 7200 and at 4k we've got more

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.830 
your la 7200 and at 4k we've got more
room<00:05:05.110> to<00:05:05.440> adjust<00:05:05.850> pixel<00:05:06.850> wise<00:05:07.060> or<00:05:07.450> we<00:05:07.660> have

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
room to adjust pixel wise or we have

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.320 
room to adjust pixel wise or we have
more<00:05:08.110> control<00:05:08.500> over<00:05:08.940> fixing<00:05:09.940> some<00:05:10.150> of<00:05:10.180> those

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
more control over fixing some of those

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.920 
more control over fixing some of those
faults<00:05:10.720> like<00:05:10.810> that<00:05:11.610> so<00:05:12.610> that's<00:05:13.000> just<00:05:13.210> a<00:05:13.360> really

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
faults like that so that's just a really

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.250 
faults like that so that's just a really
short<00:05:14.050> tip<00:05:14.980> and<00:05:15.810> essentially<00:05:16.810> the<00:05:16.930> way<00:05:17.080> I'm

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
short tip and essentially the way I'm

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.130 
short tip and essentially the way I'm
going<00:05:17.560> to<00:05:17.620> be<00:05:17.830> uploading<00:05:18.160> 4k<00:05:18.880> videos<00:05:19.270> from<00:05:19.990> the

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
going to be uploading 4k videos from the

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.840 
going to be uploading 4k videos from the
gh2<00:05:20.470> to<00:05:21.220> YouTube<00:05:21.580> so<00:05:21.850> I'm<00:05:22.420> editing<00:05:23.140> and<00:05:23.850> color

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
gh2 to YouTube so I'm editing and color

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.180 
gh2 to YouTube so I'm editing and color
correcting<00:05:25.390> at<00:05:25.600> 4k<00:05:25.900> and<00:05:26.290> then<00:05:26.440> outputting<00:05:27.100> a

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
correcting at 4k and then outputting a

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.180 
correcting at 4k and then outputting a
4k<00:05:27.640> master<00:05:28.420> file<00:05:28.600> for<00:05:28.900> YouTube<00:05:29.200> and<00:05:29.770> I'll<00:05:29.860> show

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
4k master file for YouTube and I'll show

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
4k master file for YouTube and I'll show
you<00:05:30.220> in<00:05:31.000> Vegas<00:05:31.900> you<00:05:32.170> can<00:05:32.200> output<00:05:32.500> any<00:05:33.210> mpeg-4

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
you in Vegas you can output any mpeg-4

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.040 
you in Vegas you can output any mpeg-4
file<00:05:34.480> at<00:05:35.250> sizes<00:05:36.250> larger<00:05:36.760> than<00:05:36.940> 2000<00:05:37.570> other

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
file at sizes larger than 2000 other

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.340 
file at sizes larger than 2000 other
things<00:05:38.440> like<00:05:38.650> MPEG<00:05:39.100> 2<00:05:39.340> will<00:05:39.670> be<00:05:39.790> limited<00:05:40.180> to

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
things like MPEG 2 will be limited to

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.600 
things like MPEG 2 will be limited to
2048<00:05:41.350> pixels<00:05:41.470> across<00:05:43.800> other<00:05:44.800> formats<00:05:45.400> are

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
2048 pixels across other formats are

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.990 
2048 pixels across other formats are
limited<00:05:45.970> to<00:05:46.150> 1920<00:05:46.900> by<00:05:47.020> 1080<00:05:47.440> but<00:05:47.820> mpeg-4<00:05:48.820> or

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
limited to 1920 by 1080 but mpeg-4 or

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.290 
limited to 1920 by 1080 but mpeg-4 or
uncompressed<00:05:49.750> which<00:05:50.110> would<00:05:50.350> be<00:05:50.500> really<00:05:50.710> huge

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
uncompressed which would be really huge

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.180 
uncompressed which would be really huge
can<00:05:52.300> be<00:05:52.540> uploaded<00:05:53.110> to<00:05:53.260> YouTube<00:05:53.620> in<00:05:53.920> their

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
can be uploaded to YouTube in their

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.500 
can be uploaded to YouTube in their
native<00:05:54.610> format<00:05:54.970> so<00:05:56.880> certain<00:05:57.880> that<00:05:58.120> someone

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
native format so certain that someone

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.200 
native format so certain that someone
else<00:05:59.080> will<00:05:59.290> have<00:05:59.440> questions<00:05:59.740> about<00:06:00.610> this

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
else will have questions about this

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.360 
else will have questions about this
process<00:06:01.510> but<00:06:02.080> it<00:06:02.350> is<00:06:02.500> something<00:06:02.830> I'm<00:06:03.190> trying

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
process but it is something I'm trying

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.220 
process but it is something I'm trying
new<00:06:03.700> and<00:06:04.240> I<00:06:04.300> think<00:06:04.510> it<00:06:04.600> gives<00:06:04.720> a<00:06:04.900> little<00:06:05.080> bit

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:05.230 
new and I think it gives a little bit

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.650 
new and I think it gives a little bit
better<00:06:05.440> picture
