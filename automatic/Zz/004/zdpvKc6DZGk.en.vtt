00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.139
 portal glass and finger all mobile 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:17.059
 entertainment on glafi.com crowd weeding 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.059
 here you threw a stall 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.960
 Hello everyone, you are arrogantly 73 in front of you 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.029
 new developer answers so go 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.830
 you said that there are advances 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.140
 metal graphics actually a question 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.410
 mute graphics what will you do 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.199
 old ipad 2 devices 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.839
 iphone 4s and so on all to be 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.329
 ok with them will touch whether improvements and 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:47.949
 their developers respond changes will be 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.110
 scale depending on 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.799
 device performance on the most 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.239
 the weak of course hardly anything will 

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:58.150
 the next question is whether the decrease 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:01.900
 client weights at 18 developers respond 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:04.449
 at 18 there will not be exactly the next question as 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.610
 taip going to sell 59 of the game 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.710
 as a gift or enter in 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.740
 free sale developers are responding 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.659
 will be on sale the next question is why 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.320
 the screens on the tanks are not highlighted 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.150
 red 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.939
 as the rest of the area where it is impossible 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.770
 will this bug be fixed 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:23.710
 developers respond need to watch 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.340
 exactly what zones each tank 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.009
 separately 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.070
 some of them just do not enter college 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.859
 tank model the next question will be either 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.109
 and 7 on 7 of their sides 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:37.659
 from the clan or mouth and into one big platoon 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:39.789
 of 7 people and also against them 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.520
 developers respond to company score 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:45.310
 clan battles still think in particular 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.350
 format 7 to 7 is not sure that 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.439
 will be recruited many willing to play 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.229
 at the same time and coordination can 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:55.299
 be a problem idea make platoons 3 on 3 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.789
 for the clans however not yet 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.340
 we drop but in a separate mode 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.200
 there is in the general randomness 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.060
 the next question in the future hall base 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.979
 three tanks will be issued not 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.429
 declassified what technology 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.380
 but the question is what level they can 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.209
 please tell about which 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.850
 update will be issued tanks for 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:19.560
 combat missions at 19 or later 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.520
 developers answer 3 6 8 level 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.790
 yield will be higher than that of 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.210
 pumped cars later at 19 rather 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.250
 all new combat missions will not 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.080
 whether the next question will be increased by 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.030
 fight time due to frequent draws 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.550
 the developers will answer the cards 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.650
 redo the burning sands first on 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.650
 queues and percentage of draws on the map 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.050
 greatest of all the next question 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.040
 Will the kind of active camouflage appear 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.220
 nets on the tank 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.330
 developers will answer will indicator 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.380
 triggers as for the rest 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.450
 equipment 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.930
 visual display of masks network and on 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.760
 the tank will not have the next question earlier 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.550
 it was said that you are above new graphics 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.840
 working as it affects fps on 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.240
 weak devices 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.730
 developers respond new beauty on 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.890
 weak devices should not expect the 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.360
 there are graphical improvements will be from 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.030
 scaled according to 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.550
 performance full stuffing will 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.290
 only on the most powerful devices 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.750
 these were the most interesting answers 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.610
