00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Today we will look at Dyuk with micro 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.089
 in blocks and so we need us 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:11.280
 need a centrifuge and out of fashion 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.730
 forestry pipes and build engine 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.609
 craft 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:19.890
 as well as the usual chest with directly 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:25.500
 diamond saw from fashion 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:30.029
 red power or projekt red power on 147 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.520
 projekt red 14 and also what blocks 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.820
 for example a diamond block which 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.390
 want to bale and cobble for example or 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.739
 ground or something else like cheap sand for example 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:48.000
 and so we saw 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:52.949
 diamond block in half and sawing 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.500
 all cobblestone we get 2 stacks of cobblestone 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.870
 and two blocks 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.910
 diamond course demigod a 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.329
 so now we have to put in 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:07.890
 the centrifuge is one on your floor block and 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.710
 the rest is all put the chest is important not 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.150
 forget that the centrifuge will fit 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.240
 only sixty-four subjects and 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.150
 the rest will start to fall out therefore 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:23.330
 we put 6 3 subjects 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:28.540
 toni have already gone so we are waiting for time 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.540
 look at the centrifuge and look at us 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:39.340
 cobblestones and a tangle and are already turning into 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:39.340
 diamond wait until dug out so 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.850
 and we got a stack of semi blocks from 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.750
 diamonds 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.380
 now they can both be separated 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.380
 connect 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:19.300
 these are equivalent diamond blocks 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:22.960
 semi-blocks you can create them 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.960
 we get diamond blocks 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.790
 they are also put 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.750
 and so you can bathe with all items 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.820
 which you don't need and get those 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:47.470
 which you need only works with 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:47.470
 in blocks, that's all youtube 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:55.180
 it has already been fixed on many servers 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:03:00.080
 therefore it is quite difficult to find him 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:02.660
 however, there are still such servers being solved 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.230
 happily checking the blocks that 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.250
 enter the centrifuge or other 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.470
 blocks can also be renamed 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:16.790
 Aydishniki in all semi blocks and other 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:20.870
 of these products and thus can 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:25.100
 avoid such dupe dupe of course this 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:28.970
 is that the items which 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.690
 they are already sprayed and the disks are the same 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.290
 there is now for example 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:36.550
 diamond block 25 and 31 4 and plate from 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.550
 cobblestone same go
