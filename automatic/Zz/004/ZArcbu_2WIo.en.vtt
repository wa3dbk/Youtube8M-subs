this<00:00:22.050> exercises<00:00:22.590> accent<00:00:23.430> tap<00:00:23.640> most<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.689> what

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
this exercises accent tap most of what

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.380 
this exercises accent tap most of what
we<00:00:24.960> do<00:00:25.170> is<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.859> controlling<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.670> accidents

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
we do is the controlling of accidents

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.660 
we do is the controlling of accidents
compared<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.080> taps<00:00:28.369> one<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.519> more

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
compared to the taps one of the more

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.460 
compared to the taps one of the more
difficult<00:00:29.820> things<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.480> do<00:00:30.689> for<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.960> performer

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
difficult things to do for a performer

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.950 
difficult things to do for a performer
is<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.710> control<00:00:32.130> those<00:00:32.399> taps<00:00:32.759> into<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.719> low

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
is to control those taps into a low

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.380 
is to control those taps into a low
height<00:00:34.309> so<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.489> works<00:00:35.790> on<00:00:35.969> those<00:00:36.120> two

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
height so this works on those two

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.299 
height so this works on those two
heights<00:00:36.660> we're<00:00:37.200> going<00:00:37.469> from<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.800> full<00:00:38.040> wrist

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
heights we're going from a full wrist

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.490 
heights we're going from a full wrist
extension<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> low<00:00:39.840> three-inch<00:00:40.500> tap<00:00:40.770> height

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.930 

controlling<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.950> getting<00:00:47.190> uniformity

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
controlling this and getting uniformity

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.360 
controlling this and getting uniformity
is<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.690> most<00:00:48.899> important<00:00:49.379> thing<00:00:49.559> we<00:00:49.710> can<00:00:49.860> do<00:00:50.100> in

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
is the most important thing we can do in

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.310 
is the most important thing we can do in
developing<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.360> fundamental<00:00:51.840> sound<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
developing the fundamental sound of the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.520 
developing the fundamental sound of the
ansan<00:00:53.030> pay<00:00:54.030> close<00:00:54.270> attention<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:55.050> what<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
ansan pay close attention to what the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.200 
ansan pay close attention to what the
performers<00:00:56.010> are<00:00:56.160> doing<00:00:56.399> when<00:00:56.579> they<00:00:56.670> execute

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
performers are doing when they execute

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.590 
performers are doing when they execute
the<00:00:57.300> accent<00:00:57.809> compared<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.770> tap<00:00:58.980> an

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
the accent compared to the tap an

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.900 
the accent compared to the tap an
accented<00:01:00.600> stroke<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.230> accented<00:01:01.910> mostly

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
accented stroke is accented mostly

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.490 
accented stroke is accented mostly
because<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.629> fact<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.290> notes

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
because of the fact that the notes

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.130 
because of the fact that the notes
around<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.979> are<00:01:05.100> soft<00:01:05.600> when<00:01:06.600> playing<00:01:06.900> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
around it are soft when playing the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.370 
around it are soft when playing the
accent<00:01:07.619> versus<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.400> tap<00:01:08.689> don't<00:01:09.689> overplay<00:01:10.140> the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
accent versus the tap don't overplay the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.440 
accent versus the tap don't overplay the
accent<00:01:10.860> over<00:01:11.369> playing<00:01:11.610> an<00:01:11.820> accent<00:01:12.270> will

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
accent over playing an accent will

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.320 
accent over playing an accent will
create<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.780> distorted<00:01:13.290> sound<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:14.119> it<00:01:15.119> will

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
create a distorted sound and it will

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.679 
create a distorted sound and it will
create<00:01:15.570> an<00:01:15.900> actual<00:01:16.740> lighter<00:01:17.310> tap<00:01:17.759> sound<00:01:18.119> that

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
create an actual lighter tap sound that

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.920 
create an actual lighter tap sound that
has<00:01:18.869> less<00:01:19.200> control<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.009> less<00:01:20.700> body<00:01:21.030> that's

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
has less control and less body that's

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.780 
has less control and less body that's
going<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.229> become<00:01:22.530> more<00:01:22.770> problematic<00:01:23.040> as<00:01:23.640> we

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
going to become more problematic as we

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.940 
going to become more problematic as we
start<00:01:24.060> adding<00:01:24.330> flam's<00:01:24.659> race<00:01:25.439> notes

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
start adding flam's race notes

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.179 
start adding flam's race notes
diddles<00:01:26.909> rolls<00:01:27.360> things<00:01:27.720> like<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.950> are

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
diddles rolls things like that that are

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.920 
diddles rolls things like that that are
layered<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.360> top<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.840> these<00:01:31.170> taps<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> good

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
layered on top of these taps so a good

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.109 
layered on top of these taps so a good
well<00:01:33.930> balanced<00:01:34.560> accent<00:01:35.189> compared<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.909> tap

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
well balanced accent compared to the tap

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.490 
well balanced accent compared to the tap
is<00:01:36.360> what<00:01:36.570> we're<00:01:36.720> looking<00:01:37.079> for<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.380> this

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
is what we're looking for in this

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.190 
is what we're looking for in this
exercise<00:01:38.630> when<00:01:39.630> we're<00:01:39.810> talking<00:01:39.960> about

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
exercise when we're talking about

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.730 
exercise when we're talking about
melodic<00:01:40.829> instruments<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.549> lot<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.390> times

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
melodic instruments a lot of times

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.139 
melodic instruments a lot of times
accents<00:01:43.740> are<00:01:43.860> created<00:01:44.310> just<00:01:44.340> from<00:01:45.119> changing

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
accents are created just from changing

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:54.380 
accents are created just from changing
pitches

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.120 

it's<00:01:55.390> very<00:01:55.630> important<00:01:56.170> that<00:01:56.410> with<00:01:56.620> the<00:01:56.800> mallet

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
it's very important that with the mallet

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.580 
it's very important that with the mallet
section<00:01:57.550> that<00:01:58.060> they<00:01:58.210> actually<00:01:58.450> execute<00:01:59.380> an

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
section that they actually execute an

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.430 
section that they actually execute an
accented<00:02:00.100> stroke<00:02:00.400> don't<00:02:01.210> just<00:02:01.510> simply<00:02:01.900> hear

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
accented stroke don't just simply hear

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.790 
accented stroke don't just simply hear
an<00:02:02.650> accent<00:02:03.720> sort<00:02:04.720> of<00:02:04.900> because<00:02:05.320> it<00:02:05.470> changed

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
an accent sort of because it changed

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.000 
an accent sort of because it changed
pitch<00:02:06.300> actually<00:02:07.300> make<00:02:07.510> them<00:02:07.750> play<00:02:08.619> an

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.010 
pitch actually make them play an

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.530 
pitch actually make them play an
accented<00:02:09.580> stroke<00:02:09.790> you<00:02:10.060> might<00:02:10.240> even<00:02:10.360> try

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
accented stroke you might even try

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.590 
accented stroke you might even try
having<00:02:11.410> them<00:02:11.710> pick<00:02:11.980> a<00:02:12.250> single<00:02:13.150> note<00:02:13.330> and

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
having them pick a single note and

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.170 
having them pick a single note and
playing<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.530> whole<00:02:14.860> exercise<00:02:15.400> on<00:02:15.670> that<00:02:15.970> one

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
playing the whole exercise on that one

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.390 
playing the whole exercise on that one
note<00:02:16.480> once<00:02:17.320> they<00:02:17.500> get<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.800> concept<00:02:18.280> of

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
note once they get the concept of

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.820 
note once they get the concept of
accented<00:02:19.030> verses<00:02:19.390> on<00:02:19.510> accented<00:02:19.960> notes<00:02:19.990> then

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
accented verses on accented notes then

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:37.670 
accented verses on accented notes then
they<00:02:21.010> can<00:02:21.160> voice<00:02:21.400> around<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.210> instrument<00:02:36.240> as

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
they can voice around the instrument as

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.370 
they can voice around the instrument as
you<00:02:38.680> increase<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.250> speed<00:02:39.370> of<00:02:39.550> the<00:02:39.700> exercise

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
you increase the speed of the exercise

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.840 
you increase the speed of the exercise
and<00:02:41.380> pay<00:02:41.590> careful<00:02:41.920> attention<00:02:42.100> to<00:02:42.550> make<00:02:42.670> sure

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
and pay careful attention to make sure

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.440 
and pay careful attention to make sure
that<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.150> taps<00:02:43.420> remain<00:02:43.930> relaxed<00:02:45.120> when<00:02:46.120> you<00:02:46.270> go

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
that the taps remain relaxed when you go

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.870 
that the taps remain relaxed when you go
faster<00:02:46.990> as<00:02:47.200> a<00:02:47.260> performer<00:02:47.890> it's<00:02:48.100> easy<00:02:48.490> to<00:02:48.700> let

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
faster as a performer it's easy to let

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.500 
faster as a performer it's easy to let
those<00:02:49.060> taps<00:02:49.390> come<00:02:49.660> up<00:02:49.870> in<00:02:50.080> height<00:02:50.290> but<00:02:50.980> again

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
those taps come up in height but again

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.630 
those taps come up in height but again
that<00:02:52.510> muddies<00:02:52.990> the<00:02:53.020> sound<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:53.740> creates<00:02:54.430> more
