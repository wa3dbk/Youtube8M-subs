00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.430
 each directorate has the coordinator of the 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.340
 saresp 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:21.180
 already with the entire schedule 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.150
 expired on material awaiting arrival 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.540
 we as the board receive the proof 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.130
 are organized by school to make the 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.950
 security issue 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.140
 beginning of transportation is when the 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.620
 truck arrives here at the place where he 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.579
 will deliver him to the seal in all 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.310
 the doors 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.039
 so we saw the ft to check with 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.320
 check if everything is ok 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:49.199
 we'll take the evidence that 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.140
 this way the sealed component 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:55.079
 if one is without teaching acre 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.300
 We have to make a new king there. 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.079
 packed in a room where a 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.820
 well-treated door security system 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.280
 cameras etc. 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.570
 the day before the race on the 26th to the 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:14.430
 directors appear to the board of directors for 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:17.310
 withdraw a recall control from them 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.759
 we set up a schedule where 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.159
 the teaching supervisor also assists the 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.020
 I do not receive a withdrawal from this 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.799
 material 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.750
 my boxes with the consul and relief 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.659
 I took the boxes all the boxes 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.759
 You're the girl, if I go tomorrow. 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.450
 receive the applicators together with the 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.270
 tax and we will then make a 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.119
 training with them before as we go 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.189
 to distribute these sealed tests is not 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.610
 all will leave this room 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.039
 I'll show you to the living room if my 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.600
 expectation is that everything works out 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.490
 that space runs smoothly with 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.399
 really like it 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.030
 our expectation of meeting clear 100% 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.030
 of the goal
