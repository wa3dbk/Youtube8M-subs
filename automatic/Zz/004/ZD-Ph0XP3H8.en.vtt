so on the front here we have a very nice
metal<00:00:13.500> finish<00:00:14.630> where<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.750> computer<00:00:16.199> will<00:00:16.350> lie

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
metal finish where the computer will lie

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.769 
metal finish where the computer will lie
on<00:00:16.590> we<00:00:17.340> have<00:00:17.580> some<00:00:17.880> rubber<00:00:18.090> feet<00:00:18.390> right<00:00:18.570> here

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
your computer won't slide off we have

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.370 
your computer won't slide off we have
two<00:00:23.250> rubber<00:00:23.490> pads<00:00:23.820> up<00:00:24.000> here<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.539> we<00:00:25.260> have

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
two rubber pads up here and we have

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.859 
two rubber pads up here and we have
holes<00:00:25.650> all<00:00:26.039> over<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.430> place<00:00:26.760> for<00:00:27.090> airflow<00:00:27.510> and

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
holes all over the place for airflow and

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.019 
holes all over the place for airflow and
for<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.500> fans<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:29.010> blow<00:00:29.130> air<00:00:29.429> through<00:00:29.460> but

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
for the fans to blow air through but

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.490 
for the fans to blow air through but
we'll<00:00:30.179> get<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.539> in<00:00:30.689> just<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:31.050> minute

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
we'll get to that in just a minute

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.590 
we'll get to that in just a minute
if<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.520> look<00:00:32.700> at<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.180> side<00:00:33.570> here

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
if you look at it on the side here

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.080 
if you look at it on the side here
you'll<00:00:34.440> notice<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.280> has<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.489> little<00:00:35.730> stand

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
you'll notice that it has a little stand

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.569 
you'll notice that it has a little stand
here<00:00:36.480> with<00:00:36.870> rubber<00:00:37.110> feet<00:00:37.350> on<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.559> bottom<00:00:37.800> so

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
here with rubber feet on the bottom so

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.610 
here with rubber feet on the bottom so
it<00:00:38.700> doesn't<00:00:39.030> slide<00:00:39.210> around<00:00:39.270> once<00:00:39.960> again<00:00:40.290> and

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
it doesn't slide around once again and

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.670 
it doesn't slide around once again and
this<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.460> where<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:42.120> stands<00:00:42.719> up<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.170> elevates

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
this is where it stands up and elevates

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.029 
this is where it stands up and elevates
so<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.980> air<00:00:44.160> can<00:00:44.430> flow<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:45.260> suck<00:00:46.260> out<00:00:46.440> and

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
so the air can flow and suck out and

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.950 
so the air can flow and suck out and
throughout<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.760> bottom<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.360> that's<00:00:48.660> pretty

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
throughout the bottom so that's pretty

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.680 
throughout the bottom so that's pretty
cool<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.579> then<00:00:50.579> if<00:00:50.910> we<00:00:51.059> take<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.270> look<00:00:51.449> at<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
cool and then if we take a look at the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.600 
cool and then if we take a look at the
back<00:00:51.899> here<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.649> where<00:00:52.860> all<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.100> fans<00:00:53.370> are

demonstrate<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.670> right<00:01:05.850> here<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.330> another

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
demonstrate that right here so another

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.020 
demonstrate that right here so another
reason<00:01:06.900> for<00:01:06.930> all<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.229> holes<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:08.580> can<00:01:08.729> click

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
reason for all the holes so I can click

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.270 
reason for all the holes so I can click
this<00:01:09.180> little<00:01:09.420> button<00:01:09.630> here<00:01:09.799> pick<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.920> up<00:01:11.100> and

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
this little button here pick it up and

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.870 
this little button here pick it up and
say<00:01:12.000> Mike<00:01:12.750> heated<00:01:13.320> areas<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:13.920> right<00:01:14.130> here<00:01:14.430> so

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
say Mike heated areas like right here so

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.640 
say Mike heated areas like right here so
I<00:01:14.939> would<00:01:15.119> just<00:01:15.270> do<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.450> drop<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.530> it

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
I would just do that drop it in and it

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.450 
I would just do that drop it in and it
walks<00:01:16.860> right<00:01:17.009> in<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.960> let<00:01:19.530> me<00:01:19.619> get<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:19.860> USB

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
walks right in on so let me get this USB

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.120 
walks right in on so let me get this USB
thing<00:01:20.909> out<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.659> can<00:01:21.689> show<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.500> so

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
thing out so that you can show that so

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.179 
thing out so that you can show that so
you<00:01:23.220> just<00:01:23.250> go<00:01:23.549> over<00:01:23.640> here<00:01:24.049> push<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.380> find

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
you just go over here push it in find

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.990 
you just go over here push it in find
the<00:01:26.490> holes<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.799> there<00:01:28.799> goes<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:29.490> right<00:01:29.820> in

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
the holes and there goes it's right in

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.600 
the holes and there goes it's right in
there<00:01:30.270> same<00:01:30.659> with<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.930> other<00:01:31.049> one<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.610> could

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
there same with the other one you could

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.870 
there same with the other one you could
do<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.360> one<00:01:33.540> comes<00:01:33.810> with<00:01:34.049> two<00:01:34.439> fans

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
do that so this one comes with two fans

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.789 
do that so this one comes with two fans
I<00:01:35.880> believe<00:01:36.570> there's<00:01:36.810> one<00:01:36.869> with<00:01:37.200> three<00:01:37.530> fans

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
I believe there's one with three fans

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.679 
I believe there's one with three fans
but<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.189> don't<00:01:38.490> think<00:01:38.820> that's<00:01:39.060> really<00:01:39.270> worth<00:01:39.450> it

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
but I don't think that's really worth it

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.950 
but I don't think that's really worth it
and<00:01:39.869> then<00:01:40.380> these<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:41.040> connect<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> USB<00:01:42.600> cable

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
and then these to connect to a USB cable

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.340 
and then these to connect to a USB cable
which<00:01:43.649> gives<00:01:44.040> these<00:01:44.310> two<00:01:44.579> fans<00:01:44.880> power<00:01:45.200> so<00:01:46.200> this

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
which gives these two fans power so this

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.249 
which gives these two fans power so this
is<00:01:46.500> just<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.740> standard<00:01:47.009> USB<00:01:47.369> 2.0<00:01:48.090> port<00:01:48.420> but<00:01:48.869> cool

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
is just a standard USB 2.0 port but cool

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.660 
is just a standard USB 2.0 port but cool
thing<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.619> on<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.890> other<00:01:49.950> end<00:01:50.100> there<00:01:50.490> is

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
thing is on the other end there is

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.210 
thing is on the other end there is
another<00:01:51.180> standard<00:01:51.540> USB<00:01:51.930> port<00:01:52.079> which<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:52.860> used

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
another standard USB port which is used

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.850 
another standard USB port which is used
so<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.759> won't<00:01:53.970> miss<00:01:54.960> any<00:01:55.259> ports<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.710> once

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
so that you won't miss any ports so once

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.469 
so that you won't miss any ports so once
you<00:01:55.979> plug<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.549> can<00:01:56.790> plug<00:01:57.000> USB

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
you plug this in you can plug USB

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.959 
you plug this in you can plug USB
flashdrive<00:01:58.020> mouse<00:01:58.350> whatever<00:01:58.860> into<00:01:59.310> here<00:01:59.579> and

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
flashdrive mouse whatever into here and

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.069 
flashdrive mouse whatever into here and
will<00:02:00.060> work<00:02:00.180> fine<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.600> thought<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.960> was<00:02:01.049> a

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
will work fine so I thought that was a

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.230 
will work fine so I thought that was a
really<00:02:01.350> cool<00:02:01.560> feature<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.729> that's<00:02:02.759> pretty

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
really cool feature so that's pretty

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.310 
really cool feature so that's pretty
much<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.780> for<00:02:04.020> all<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.290> features<00:02:06.140> ok<00:02:07.140> that

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
much it for all the features ok that

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.889 
much it for all the features ok that
just<00:02:07.530> fell<00:02:07.710> off<00:02:07.950> but<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.789> wasn't<00:02:09.390> putting<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.720> on

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
just fell off but I wasn't putting it on

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.020 
just fell off but I wasn't putting it on

laptop<00:02:20.190> sitting<00:02:20.400> on<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:20.790> perfectly<00:02:21.209> fine<00:02:21.450> it's

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
laptop sitting on it perfectly fine it's

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.809 
laptop sitting on it perfectly fine it's
not<00:02:22.140> going<00:02:22.349> to<00:02:22.410> slide<00:02:22.680> off<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:23.220> much<00:02:23.459> unless

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
not going to slide off that much unless

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.270 
not going to slide off that much unless
you<00:02:23.940> pull<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.300> off<00:02:24.450> on<00:02:25.290> this<00:02:25.590> will<00:02:25.739> support<00:02:25.920> up

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
you pull it off on this will support up

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.250 
you pull it off on this will support up
to<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.430> 15<00:02:26.880> inch<00:02:26.910> laptop<00:02:27.150> which<00:02:27.750> is<00:02:27.900> what<00:02:28.110> my

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
to a 15 inch laptop which is what my

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.290 
to a 15 inch laptop which is what my
laptop<00:02:28.770> is<00:02:29.010> I'm<00:02:29.640> sure<00:02:29.849> you<00:02:29.970> could<00:02:30.120> use<00:02:30.269> a

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
laptop is I'm sure you could use a

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.300 
laptop is I'm sure you could use a
little<00:02:30.630> bit<00:02:30.750> bigger<00:02:30.959> but<00:02:31.260> try<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.560> fit<00:02:32.130> around

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
little bit bigger but try to fit around

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.580 
little bit bigger but try to fit around
that<00:02:32.580> area<00:02:32.910> so<00:02:33.660> as<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:33.810> can<00:02:33.959> see<00:02:34.140> here<00:02:34.380> there's

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
that area so as you can see here there's

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.920 
that area so as you can see here there's
tons<00:02:35.069> of<00:02:35.340> airflow<00:02:35.790> this<00:02:36.090> goes<00:02:36.420> through<00:02:36.599> the

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
tons of airflow this goes through the

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.620 
tons of airflow this goes through the
holes<00:02:37.190> elevation<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.430> these<00:02:39.000> vents<00:02:39.390> down

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
holes elevation and these vents down

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.020 
holes elevation and these vents down
here<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.470> right<00:02:40.860> now<00:02:41.010> air<00:02:41.250> is<00:02:41.400> flowing<00:02:41.610> all

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
here so right now air is flowing all

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.110 
here so right now air is flowing all
over<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.420> place<00:02:42.920> and<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.430> fans<00:02:44.730> are<00:02:44.940> also

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
over the place and the fans are also

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.750 
over the place and the fans are also
sucking<00:02:45.720> in<00:02:45.930> hot<00:02:46.590> air<00:02:46.739> blowing<00:02:47.310> them<00:02:47.610> out

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
sucking in hot air blowing them out

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.120 
sucking in hot air blowing them out
through<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.060> bottom<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.510> coming<00:02:48.989> out<00:02:49.110> so<00:02:49.920> I'm

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
through the bottom and coming out so I'm

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.150 
through the bottom and coming out so I'm
they're<00:02:50.600> relatively<00:02:51.600> quiet<00:02:52.170> I<00:02:52.620> don't<00:02:52.980> know<00:02:53.069> if

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
they're relatively quiet I don't know if

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.380 
they're relatively quiet I don't know if
you<00:02:53.250> can<00:02:53.400> hear<00:02:53.580> that<00:02:53.700> on<00:02:53.880> camera

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
you can hear that on camera

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.280 
you can hear that on camera
they're<00:02:54.810> not<00:02:54.989> like<00:02:55.350> silent<00:02:56.100> but<00:02:56.760> for<00:02:57.330> fans<00:02:57.989> to

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
they're not like silent but for fans to

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.559 
they're not like silent but for fans to
fans<00:02:58.739> they're<00:02:59.069> actually<00:02:59.430> pretty<00:02:59.640> good<00:02:59.880> are

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
fans they're actually pretty good are

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.570 
fans they're actually pretty good are
the<00:03:00.780> fans<00:03:01.519> spit<00:03:02.519> out<00:03:02.730> pretty<00:03:03.980> pretty<00:03:04.980> warm<00:03:05.250> air

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
the fans spit out pretty pretty warm air

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.039 
the fans spit out pretty pretty warm air
when<00:03:06.150> you're<00:03:06.269> using<00:03:06.569> it<00:03:06.810> heavily<00:03:08.360> but<00:03:09.360> I<00:03:09.720> think

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
when you're using it heavily but I think

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.190 
when you're using it heavily but I think
overall<00:03:10.349> it's<00:03:10.620> good<00:03:10.769> it<00:03:10.950> also<00:03:11.130> elevates<00:03:11.819> your

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
overall it's good it also elevates your

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.990 
overall it's good it also elevates your
laptop<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.230> little<00:03:13.560> bit<00:03:13.709> so<00:03:14.280> that<00:03:14.549> when<00:03:14.849> you're

a little bit hard to do on camera here
but<00:04:09.569> I'll<00:04:09.840> try

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.520 

but<00:04:16.130> uh<00:04:16.160> it's<00:04:17.090> pretty<00:04:17.360> cool<00:04:17.600> feature<00:04:17.959> it's<00:04:18.350> not

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
but uh it's pretty cool feature it's not

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.920 
but uh it's pretty cool feature it's not
gonna<00:04:18.680> completely<00:04:19.190> hold<00:04:19.610> it<00:04:19.760> um<00:04:20.299> if<00:04:20.600> you<00:04:20.720> hold

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
gonna completely hold it um if you hold

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.120 
gonna completely hold it um if you hold
it<00:04:21.049> like<00:04:21.080> this<00:04:21.230> is<00:04:21.470> gonna<00:04:21.650> slide<00:04:21.920> out<00:04:22.100> of

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
it like this is gonna slide out of

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.220 
it like this is gonna slide out of
course<00:04:22.520> from<00:04:22.790> the<00:04:22.910> sides<00:04:23.150> but<00:04:23.690> putting<00:04:24.020> it<00:04:24.140> at

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
course from the sides but putting it at

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.710 
course from the sides but putting it at
a<00:04:24.320> bag<00:04:24.560> it's<00:04:25.190> nice<00:04:25.460> that<00:04:25.490> it<00:04:25.880> kind<00:04:26.420> of<00:04:26.480> fits

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
a bag it's nice that it kind of fits

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.200 
a bag it's nice that it kind of fits
together<00:04:26.990> more<00:04:27.500> than<00:04:27.530> having<00:04:28.010> just<00:04:28.370> this<00:04:28.880> part

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
together more than having just this part

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.930 
together more than having just this part
since<00:04:29.930> its<00:04:30.170> elevated<00:04:30.770> if<00:04:31.520> you<00:04:31.640> know<00:04:31.760> what<00:04:31.910> I

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
since its elevated if you know what I

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.530 
since its elevated if you know what I
mean<00:04:32.120> it<00:04:32.360> just<00:04:32.830> it<00:04:33.830> just<00:04:34.160> saves<00:04:34.580> more<00:04:34.850> space<00:04:35.210> in

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
mean it just it just saves more space in

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.360 
mean it just it just saves more space in
your<00:04:35.600> laptop<00:04:36.110> bag<00:04:36.290> so<00:04:36.500> this<00:04:36.620> will<00:04:36.800> slide<00:04:37.040> right

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
your laptop bag so this will slide right

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.550 
your laptop bag so this will slide right
into<00:04:37.580> your<00:04:37.790> laptop<00:04:37.940> bag<00:04:38.360> it's<00:04:39.050> a<00:04:39.110> little<00:04:39.410> bit

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
into your laptop bag it's a little bit

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.190 
into your laptop bag it's a little bit
thicker<00:04:40.220> and<00:04:40.490> one<00:04:41.210> downside<00:04:41.660> is<00:04:41.840> that<00:04:41.870> you

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
thicker and one downside is that you

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.750 
thicker and one downside is that you
will<00:04:42.440> have<00:04:42.590> to<00:04:42.710> take<00:04:42.890> out<00:04:43.070> your<00:04:43.100> fans<00:04:43.460> and

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
will have to take out your fans and

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.400 
will have to take out your fans and
carry<00:04:44.000> them<00:04:44.150> separately<00:04:44.660> but<00:04:45.080> they're<00:04:45.200> pretty

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
carry them separately but they're pretty

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.820 
carry them separately but they're pretty
thin<00:04:45.850> not<00:04:46.850> that<00:04:47.060> bad<00:04:47.300> so<00:04:48.020> this<00:04:48.350> is<00:04:48.530> what<00:04:48.710> the

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
thin not that bad so this is what the

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.270 
thin not that bad so this is what the
fans<00:04:49.070> look<00:04:49.280> like<00:04:49.490> up<00:04:49.820> close<00:04:50.920> so<00:04:51.920> there's<00:04:52.100> been

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
fans look like up close so there's been

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.610 
fans look like up close so there's been
pretty<00:04:52.520> fast<00:04:52.850> I'm<00:04:53.420> not<00:04:53.870> really<00:04:54.170> sure<00:04:54.440> exactly

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
pretty fast I'm not really sure exactly

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.940 
pretty fast I'm not really sure exactly
the<00:04:55.100> RPM<00:04:56.140> collect<00:04:57.140> lots<00:04:57.380> of<00:04:57.530> dust<00:04:57.710> so<00:04:57.830> you

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
the RPM collect lots of dust so you

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.320 
the RPM collect lots of dust so you
might<00:04:58.070> want<00:04:58.250> to<00:04:58.280> clean<00:04:58.460> them<00:04:58.610> out<00:04:58.730> regularly

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
might want to clean them out regularly

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.540 
might want to clean them out regularly
and<00:04:59.630> they<00:05:00.440> should<00:05:00.650> last<00:05:00.830> you<00:05:01.070> a<00:05:01.100> pretty<00:05:01.340> long

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
and they should last you a pretty long

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.960 
and they should last you a pretty long
time<00:05:02.020> so<00:05:03.020> that's<00:05:03.830> pretty<00:05:04.250> much<00:05:04.340> the<00:05:04.520> cooler

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
time so that's pretty much the cooler

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.990 
time so that's pretty much the cooler
