00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.240
 I am all rose and today we are in a 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.189
 minecraft video where I'm going to 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.650
 show you a new tutorial 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:21.590
 this time in a trap to move very 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:25.279
 simple the truth and good what 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:29.090
 we will need is to have doors worth 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:32.759
 iron or wooden doors and 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:37.170
 budgeted stone or wood worth 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:41.039
 then very simple we put the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.670
 pressure plate and place the doors 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:43.670
 in this way 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.130
 A) Yes 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.610
 and so and also if we want then we can 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.610
 place 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.940
 a block 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.340
 here in the middle is worth so that the mop does not 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.260
 escape 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.230
 many people will know about this trick but 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.250
 a lot of other people do not, so if I already 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.950
 you know then 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:16.370
 do not see the video ever good I'll do 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:19.700
 now the other with the pressure plate 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:23.080
 and the iron doors are worth to 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.080
 that you see that it works with everything 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:31.530
 and well, here we can do what 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.530
 a fantastic criterion 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:41.150
 you let me put a kripper and as a coward 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:44.050
 Well, I'm going to get another one to see 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.050
 a skeleton 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.330
 I can not 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.689
 well, a chicken 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.640
 there is not in like this 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.270
 and well, for example, we could put 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:14.210
 the whale here we push it 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.210
 and now ibex hello is already locked 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.950
 and the same here 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.260
 tatxan veis is now closed 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.020
 so I hope you liked it 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.650
 ok is a simple way many people 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.680
 There will be but good 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.400
 and nothing nothing else on my part until 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.909
 so 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.909
 happy
