00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
your mini-map so that is a really

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.699 
your mini-map so that is a really
downside<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.520> it<00:03:14.550> and<00:03:17.989> besides<00:03:18.989> that<00:03:19.440> it's

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
downside to it and besides that it's

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.710 
downside to it and besides that it's

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.880 
didn't know they took out stopping power
in<00:03:56.880> this<00:03:56.970> game<00:03:57.030> which<00:03:58.019> i<00:03:58.170> think<00:03:58.230> was<00:03:58.470> an<00:03:58.650> a

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
in this game which i think was an a

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.979 
in this game which i think was an a
great<00:03:59.340> idea<00:03:59.670> because<00:03:59.820> now<00:04:00.570> people<00:04:00.780> will

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
great idea because now people will

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.330 
great idea because now people will
actually<00:04:01.170> pick<00:04:01.500> other<00:04:01.800> perks<00:04:04.130> especially<00:04:05.130> me

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
actually pick other perks especially me

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.580 
actually pick other perks especially me
because<00:04:05.670> i<00:04:05.880> use<00:04:06.090> stopping<00:04:07.019> power<00:04:07.140> probably

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
because i use stopping power probably

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.300 
because i use stopping power probably
ninety<00:04:07.920> five<00:04:08.040> percent<00:04:08.100> at<00:04:08.580> a<00:04:08.640> time<00:04:10.100> this<00:04:11.100> game

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
ninety five percent at a time this game

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.860 
ninety five percent at a time this game
looks<00:04:11.550> to<00:04:11.700> be<00:04:11.820> balanced<00:04:12.300> it<00:04:12.420> takes<00:04:12.630> a<00:04:12.720> lot

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
looks to be balanced it takes a lot

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.350 
looks to be balanced it takes a lot

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
team deathmatch on the firing range i

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:50.129 
team deathmatch on the firing range i
think<00:04:43.509> it's<00:04:43.659> cold<00:04:43.900> and<00:04:46.860> basically<00:04:49.080> there's<00:04:50.080> a

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
think it's cold and basically there's a

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.010 
think it's cold and basically there's a
lot<00:04:50.439> of<00:04:50.650> different<00:04:51.159> types<00:04:51.340> of<00:04:51.520> guns<00:04:51.699> and<00:04:52.150> the

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
lot of different types of guns and the

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.649 
lot of different types of guns and the
LMGs<00:04:53.889> actually<00:04:54.430> reload<00:04:54.819> a<00:04:54.849> little<00:04:55.150> bit<00:04:55.240> faster

00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:55.659 
LMGs actually reload a little bit faster

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:59.040 
LMGs actually reload a little bit faster
and<00:04:55.930> are<00:04:56.729> do<00:04:57.729> a<00:04:57.759> little<00:04:58.060> bit<00:04:58.180> less<00:04:58.389> damage<00:04:58.779> so

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
and are do a little bit less damage so

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.279 
and are do a little bit less damage so
they're<00:04:59.229> more<00:04:59.580> focused<00:05:00.870> like<00:05:01.870> they're<00:05:02.110> more

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
they're more focused like they're more
