00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.480
 hi to all and the power os I hope that 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.920
 you are fine 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.420
 so today a new video that 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.010

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.050
 will consist of introducing you to trees 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.820
 exotic destiny so the goal is to 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.289
 offer you an analysis on the imposing 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.150
 the positives and the points 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.430
 negative for those for example who 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.960
 would still exist bought the figure 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.460
 when available or from 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.380
 the climb to the maximum after having road 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.390
 rather than another weapon that did well 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.700
 sure whether it's worth it or 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.780
 not take your unique location 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.890
 Ahmadou tic in your equipment I 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.989
 start this series by introducing you 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.239
 the icebreaker so you'll get it 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.010
 the icebreaker or ice breakers in 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.629
 English is an exotic sniper rifle 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.339
 with solar guy who is a 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.870
 unique feature that looks like 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:52.850
 that in fact the hull shotgun 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.890
 invective which allows him to re generate 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.510
 automatically his ammunition so he 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.399
 contains six cartridges in the feeder 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.929
 and a regeneration every six 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.539
 about a second of a cartridge in 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:03.710
 your charger you can get this 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.280
 weapon when in the sale are 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.990
 for 17 odd piece or decrypting g 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.450
 legendary in the ass late when the 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.060
 Winner in pvp on the test or in pve 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.620
 black trouble or queen personally 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.710
 I did get in the first chest of 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.970
 reign of crotta before the update 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.380
 so the strengths of this weapon well 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.430
 sure we can again note the fact that 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.990
 this art allows you to have 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.430
 unlimited ammunition in time but 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.050
 we can also note its impact very 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.550
 high which will reward beautiful shot of 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.990
 accuracy by one shot on the 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.940
 most enemies she if he 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.340
 wore the highest of its category 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.750
 plus options that are composed of 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.580
 the improvement of this weapon are very 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.440
 interesting I think about the option 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.510
 second chance that sometimes allows for 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.550
 recover a mission when you miss 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.560
 your target as well as the so-called option 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.090
 icebreaker that will ignite victims 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.510
 to deal damage to enemies 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.420
 relatives 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.320
 the last strong point is that this art 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.570
 allows you to have ammo 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.190
 unlimited not just for her but 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.500
 for all the secondary weapons I 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.500
 so explain to me when you use 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.660
 a special weapon and that it has 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.430
 more balls just take over 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.140
 your tired of waiting for the 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.420
 loader fill up and then you 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.510
 return to your secondary weapon and 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.370
 you'll have half of the ammo the 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.810
 weak points of the hand so the point 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.550
 the most annoying of this weapon they are 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.890
 recoil that's just huge 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.020
 you are so 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.910
 obliged between each shot to take your 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.770
 your time to readjust your viewfinder 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.930
 unfortunately there is no option 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.160
 which improves this point it remains 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.890
 still correct in pve 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.910
 but I think it's going to frustrate more 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.700
 one in pvp 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.620
 to finish in pvp I think also zoom 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.840
 which is very big it is a point 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.459
 positive I think in pve but less 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.959
 interesting in pvp especially with the 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.950
 close friends because he has even more 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.650
 hard to touch them 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.450
 and finally last black point is the 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.250
 does that every time you die 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.650
 the ammo it's true initialized to 0 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.780
 even if at your death the shipper was at 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.890
 its maximum 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.420
 we will now talk about the aspect 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.830
 visual of the puts back so I find the 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.420
 design of this very nice weapon and its 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.070
 noise just at the top it stands out 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.810
 really other men on it 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.940
 recognize immediately after that you point 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.380
 exclusively personal 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.910
 now if we go back to the aspect 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.620
 helpful so we used to see a 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.950
 ammunition indicator on the backs of 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.050
 arms 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.030
 but this time on this weapon 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.340
 the heat indicator when one 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.570
 aims who changes his head from green to red 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.160
 according to the number of balls 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.620
 remaining in the charger that is 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.239
 really very practical and finally for 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.590
 conclude I think this weapon does 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.570
 part without a doubt of the best 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.890
 special weapons of the game the fact that she 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.260
 automatically recognizes his ballets 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.610
 tintin.com not neglect especially during 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.829
 the long missions I think in 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.049
 especially at dark or stiff night and 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.660
 finally it is in direct competition with 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.400
 the second exotic saiper which is the 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.850
 stoic who is certainly the best 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.870
 in pdb for its stability its decline and its 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.340
 rate of fire and that's this video 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.780
 innovative finished I hope you 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.269
 have enjoyed do not hesitate to give me 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.829
 back on this type of video I tell you 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.329
 see you soon for an upcoming video on 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.329
 from destiny go hi to more 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.470
 no no no
