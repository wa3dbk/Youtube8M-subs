00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.370
 hello to all jean pascal roux that your 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.809
 coach today I offer you a 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.269
 exercise that is for players 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.490
 confirmed having already simulated gestures 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.780
 forehand lessons free tennis and 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.699
 in particular the state of the exercises 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.380
 acceleration 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.609
 this scenario is for everyone 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.400
 players who wish to take the 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:29.400
 play on their own and dominate the exchange 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:30.900
 good luck to all this exercise 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.250
 takes place in the form of exchange 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.320
 you are in the skin of the attacker and 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.230
 had to put pressure on each of 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.969
 will only make you play half 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.290
 field trying to never back down 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.020
 behind the bottom line 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.910
 on your side your partner to lead 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.520
 his defensive strikes without 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.870
 never seek to counter attack he has 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.140
 the right to play on the whole surface 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.120
 suddenly except the corridors it takes on 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.280
 each will play want to put in 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.410
 difficulty your opponent 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.140
 the interest of linking at least between 5 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.840
 and 10 exchange he was probably turning 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.090
 accelerated everything will be done against 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.409
 in mind the aggressive side 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.850
 it is recommended to make a good 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.009
 warm up before tackling this 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.609
 exercise because the intensity is very 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.609
 important 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.979
 same exercise but this time you 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.009
 play on the other half of the field 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.780
 this exercise is very physical recover 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.240
 links before moving on to the next point 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.490
 it is similar in intensity when a 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.149
 sending exercise to other basket 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.640
 alternative 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.009
 two players in defense and 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.810
 you in position to attack that you 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.319
 allows you to alternate each keystroke on a 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.319
 half of the field 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.259
 finally to conclude the meeting 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.579
 put yourself in normal play situation 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.610
 the instruction is to be aggressive 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:13.840
 as soon as the opportunity arises 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.940
 will realize that the 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.060
 opportunities to speed up the game are 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.690
 more common than he thought 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.910
 attention however 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.860
 attacked on each hit is not the 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.470
 good option because risk taking is 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.010
 maximum and so the mistakes far more 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.410
 Frequently 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.780
 it's up to you now to judge the moment 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.310
 timely to attack and the others 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.310
 to neutralize or defend 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.740
