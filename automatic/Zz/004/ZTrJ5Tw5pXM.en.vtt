00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
against this brazilian side a bit of a

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.049 
against this brazilian side a bit of a
mix<00:00:33.930> between<00:00:34.079> golds<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.620> silvers<00:00:35.040> but<00:00:35.280> never

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
mix between golds and silvers but never

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.940 
mix between golds and silvers but never
how<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.960> know<00:00:37.079> mickley<00:00:37.410> opens<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.829> scoring

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
how you know mickley opens the scoring

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.700 
how you know mickley opens the scoring
with<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.690> know<00:00:39.809> pretty<00:00:40.079> nice<00:00:40.260> strike<00:00:40.530> into

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
with a you know pretty nice strike into

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.500 
with a you know pretty nice strike into
the<00:00:40.829> bottom<00:00:41.070> left-hand<00:00:41.280> corner<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.850> then<00:00:42.000> you

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the bottom left-hand corner and then you

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.940 
the bottom left-hand corner and then you
have<00:00:42.600> attached<00:00:42.870> powers<00:00:43.260> through<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.590> defense

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
have attached powers through the defense

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.580 
have attached powers through the defense
and<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.610> think<00:00:44.879> he<00:00:45.059> makes<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.539> nil<00:00:45.989> with<00:00:46.559> a

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
and I think he makes it to nil with a

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.319 
and I think he makes it to nil with a
nice<00:00:46.800> deal<00:00:47.010> finesse<00:00:47.610> over<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.059> top<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
nice deal finesse over the top of the

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.260 
nice deal finesse over the top of the
right<00:00:48.510> hand<00:00:48.660> side<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.739> goalkeeper<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.940> you

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
right hand side of the goalkeeper so you

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.939 
right hand side of the goalkeeper so you
know<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.480> was<00:00:51.570> an<00:00:51.690> assembly<00:00:52.079> one<00:00:52.289> minute<00:00:52.710> so

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
know that was an assembly one minute so

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.529 
know that was an assembly one minute so
you<00:00:53.010> know<00:00:53.250> quite<00:00:53.520> big<00:00:53.760> gap<00:00:53.910> between<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.300> first

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
you know quite big gap between the first

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.569 
you know quite big gap between the first
and<00:00:54.660> second<00:00:55.020> goal<00:00:55.199> if<00:00:55.680> any<00:00:55.829> more<00:00:56.010> guys<00:00:56.250> onto

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
and second goal if any more guys onto

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.599 
and second goal if any more guys onto
the<00:00:56.760> fire<00:00:57.120> final<00:00:58.109> goal<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.440> Mick<00:00:59.399> till<00:00:59.520> he

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
the fire final goal and Mick till he

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.279 
the fire final goal and Mick till he
comes<00:00:59.850> through<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.539> defense<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:01.079> like

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
comes through the defense just like

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.830 
comes through the defense just like
Jovetic<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.070> scores<00:01:02.760> again<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.600> make<00:01:03.690> it

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
Jovetic and scores again to make it

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.719 
Jovetic and scores again to make it
three<00:01:04.170> nil<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:04.650> I'm<00:01:04.830> that's<00:01:05.369> how<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.549> game

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
three nil so I'm that's how the game

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.910 
three nil so I'm that's how the game
ended<00:01:05.909> guys<00:01:06.210> three<00:01:06.780> nil<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.470> think<00:01:07.680> weekend

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
ended guys three nil and I think weekend

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.969 
ended guys three nil and I think weekend
around<00:01:08.100> 872<00:01:09.060> coins<00:01:09.479> from<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.869> match<00:01:10.020> sorry

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
around 872 coins from that match sorry

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.240 
around 872 coins from that match sorry
871<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.380> you<00:01:13.380> know<00:01:13.500> that's<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.830> nice<00:01:14.010> little

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
871 and you know that's a nice little

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.730 
871 and you know that's a nice little
pointer<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.479> add<00:01:15.600> two<00:01:15.780> hours<00:01:15.960> at<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.350> moment

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
pointer to add two hours at the moment

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.950 
pointer to add two hours at the moment
so<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:16.920> think<00:01:17.009> we<00:01:17.220> have<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:17.549> under<00:01:17.729> 2k<00:01:18.119> but<00:01:18.869> we

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
so I think we have just under 2k but we

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.480 
so I think we have just under 2k but we
have<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.200> actually<00:01:19.320> go<00:01:19.590> out<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.740> buy<00:01:20.040> to

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
have to actually go out and buy to

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.390 
have to actually go out and buy to
healing<00:01:20.909> cards<00:01:21.240> for<00:01:21.450> two<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.689> us<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.080> backs

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
healing cards for two of us in the backs

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.149 
healing cards for two of us in the backs
you<00:01:23.400> know<00:01:23.520> not<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.420> best<00:01:24.600> thing<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.869> do<00:01:25.159> well

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
you know not the best thing to do well

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.830 
you know not the best thing to do well
obviously<00:01:26.640> we<00:01:27.030> have<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.180> do<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.570> but<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.810> know

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
obviously we have to do it but you know

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.600 
obviously we have to do it but you know
it's<00:01:28.049> kind<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.350> annoying<00:01:28.560> because<00:01:28.829> we<00:01:29.340> want<00:01:29.549> to

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
it's kind of annoying because we want to

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.980 
it's kind of annoying because we want to
save<00:01:29.790> up<00:01:29.909> for<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.119> better<00:01:30.270> centre-back<00:01:30.720> rather

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
save up for a better centre-back rather

completely<00:03:31.919> a<00:03:32.760> really<00:03:33.269> good<00:03:33.419> player<00:03:33.599> really

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
completely a really good player really

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.900 
completely a really good player really
good<00:03:34.139> game<00:03:34.290> was<00:03:34.859> really<00:03:35.129> happy<00:03:35.400> with<00:03:35.519> that<00:03:35.669> and

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
good game was really happy with that and

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.280 
good game was really happy with that and
then<00:03:36.269> we<00:03:36.389> lose<00:03:36.569> connection<00:03:36.900> to<00:03:37.079> the<00:03:37.169> edge

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
then we lose connection to the edge

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.039 
then we lose connection to the edge
servers<00:03:37.739> so<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.340> think<00:03:38.430> that<00:03:38.609> takes<00:03:39.510> down<00:03:39.750> our

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
servers so I think that takes down our

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.839 
servers so I think that takes down our
dnf<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:40.799> don't<00:03:41.099> know<00:03:41.190> what<00:03:41.430> happened<00:03:41.459> there

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
dnf I don't know what happened there

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.509 
dnf I don't know what happened there
kind<00:03:42.480> of<00:03:42.569> annoying<00:03:42.810> but<00:03:43.139> you<00:03:43.199> know<00:03:43.349> we'll<00:03:44.340> get

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
kind of annoying but you know we'll get

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.180 
kind of annoying but you know we'll get
we'll<00:03:44.730> live<00:03:44.910> with<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.239> will<00:03:45.780> be<00:03:45.900> fine<00:03:46.169> but<00:03:47.099> new

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
we'll live with it will be fine but new

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.439 
we'll live with it will be fine but new
guys<00:03:47.340> we<00:03:47.579> have<00:03:47.669> to<00:03:47.790> go<00:03:47.849> into<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.030> market<00:03:48.389> and

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.449 
guys we have to go into the market and

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:51.050 
guys we have to go into the market and
buy<00:03:48.629> two<00:03:48.690> contracts<00:03:49.530> for<00:03:49.919> our<00:03:50.519> players<00:03:50.849> I

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
buy two contracts for our players I

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.759 
buy two contracts for our players I
think<00:03:51.090> it<00:03:51.299> will<00:03:51.389> actually<00:03:51.480> be<00:03:51.780> one<00:03:52.049> just<00:03:52.620> for

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
think it will actually be one just for

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.449 
think it will actually be one just for
Kalani<00:03:54.199> you<00:03:55.199> know<00:03:55.319> just<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.829> you<00:03:56.430> know

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
Kalani you know just a you know

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.009 
Kalani you know just a you know
obviously<00:03:56.669> give<00:03:57.060> them<00:03:57.180> a<00:03:57.209> boost<00:03:57.389> of<00:03:57.599> contracts

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
obviously give them a boost of contracts

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.180 
obviously give them a boost of contracts
but<00:03:58.199> I<00:03:58.290> think<00:03:58.470> this<00:03:58.620> was<00:03:58.799> actually<00:03:58.949> the<00:03:59.099> one

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
but I think this was actually the one

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.789 
but I think this was actually the one
which<00:03:59.549> took<00:04:00.209> me<00:04:00.389> ages<00:04:00.599> to<00:04:01.049> get<00:04:01.319> into<00:04:01.530> a<00:04:01.560> game

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
which took me ages to get into a game

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:02.960 
which took me ages to get into a game
and<00:04:02.099> you<00:04:02.250> know<00:04:02.400> I<00:04:02.430> find<00:04:02.730> this<00:04:02.879> really

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
and you know I find this really

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.309 
and you know I find this really
frustrating<00:04:03.690> when<00:04:03.780> this<00:04:03.900> happens<00:04:04.230> because

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
frustrating when this happens because

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.189 
frustrating when this happens because
you<00:04:04.769> know<00:04:05.280> this<00:04:05.519> is<00:04:05.549> the<00:04:06.209> sort<00:04:06.419> of<00:04:06.480> downside<00:04:07.079> to

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:07.199 
you know this is the sort of downside to

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:09.199 
you know this is the sort of downside to
playing<00:04:07.410> online<00:04:07.620> not<00:04:08.489> a<00:04:08.519> tournament<00:04:09.030> because

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
playing online not a tournament because

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.430 
playing online not a tournament because
you<00:04:09.569> know<00:04:09.690> they<00:04:09.810> can<00:04:09.840> see<00:04:10.109> your<00:04:10.260> player

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
you know they can see your player

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.199 
you know they can see your player
ratings<00:04:10.799> and<00:04:11.010> can<00:04:11.549> just<00:04:11.730> back<00:04:11.879> out<00:04:12.030> whenever

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
ratings and can just back out whenever

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.300 
ratings and can just back out whenever
they<00:04:12.449> want<00:04:12.690> to<00:04:12.750> I<00:04:13.049> think<00:04:13.590> after<00:04:13.739> a<00:04:13.949> few<00:04:14.160> back

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
they want to I think after a few back

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.770 
they want to I think after a few back
out<00:04:14.489> here<00:04:14.790> should<00:04:15.090> you<00:04:15.209> know<00:04:15.329> make<00:04:15.540> you

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
out here should you know make you

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.990 
out here should you know make you
actually<00:04:16.500> go<00:04:16.620> into<00:04:16.739> that<00:04:16.919> game<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:17.519> and

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
actually go into that game and and

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.699 
actually go into that game and and
actually<00:04:18.720> play<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:18.900> person<00:04:19.349> because<00:04:19.500> it<00:04:19.620> is

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
actually play the person because it is

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.529 
actually play the person because it is
kind<00:04:19.919> of<00:04:19.979> frustrating<00:04:20.130> when<00:04:21.000> it<00:04:21.150> was<00:04:21.269> actually

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
kind of frustrating when it was actually

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:22.820 
kind of frustrating when it was actually
happened<00:04:21.840> as<00:04:21.959> you<00:04:22.019> see<00:04:22.200> their<00:04:22.380> connection<00:04:22.800> to

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
happened as you see their connection to

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.920 
happened as you see their connection to
your<00:04:23.130> aunt<00:04:23.340> has<00:04:23.430> lost<00:04:23.700> been<00:04:23.940> lost

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
I think this is the one where we

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.710 
I think this is the one where we
actually<00:04:26.190> get<00:04:26.580> into<00:04:26.699> a<00:04:26.789> game<00:04:27.000> and<00:04:27.240> it's

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
actually get into a game and it's

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.570 
actually get into a game and it's
getting<00:04:27.900> is<00:04:28.050> good<00:04:28.320> against<00:04:28.710> his<00:04:28.889> guy<00:04:29.070> over<00:04:29.400> you
