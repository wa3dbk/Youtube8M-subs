the<00:02:20.549> former<00:02:20.819> head<00:02:20.970> of<00:02:21.000> Kenya<00:02:21.360> Wildlife

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
the former head of Kenya Wildlife

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.899 
the former head of Kenya Wildlife
Service<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:22.409> the<00:02:22.500> founder<00:02:22.890> that<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.489> African

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
Service and the founder that the African

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.240 
Service and the founder that the African
Conservation<00:02:24.540> Center<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:25.709> I<00:02:25.739> think<00:02:25.860> that

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
Conservation Center so I think that

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.190 
Conservation Center so I think that
rebuilding<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:26.940> pride<00:02:27.239> has<00:02:27.540> been<00:02:27.569> very

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
rebuilding the pride has been very

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.009 
rebuilding the pride has been very
important<00:02:28.769> in<00:02:28.980> giving<00:02:29.640> them<00:02:29.970> that<00:02:30.150> sense<00:02:30.599> that

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
important in giving them that sense that

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.080 
important in giving them that sense that
lions<00:02:31.440> not<00:02:31.680> only<00:02:32.069> today<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.580> played<00:02:32.940> that

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
lions not only today that played that

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.699 
lions not only today that played that
traditional<00:02:33.629> role<00:02:33.810> within<00:02:33.989> their<00:02:34.260> culture

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
traditional role within their culture

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.949 
traditional role within their culture
but<00:02:35.370> also<00:02:35.549> can<00:02:35.879> play<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.090> very<00:02:36.330> important<00:02:36.900> role

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
but also can play a very important role

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.530 
but also can play a very important role
in<00:02:37.349> tourism<00:02:37.920> too<00:02:38.280> so<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.150> think<00:02:39.269> they're

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
in tourism too so I think they're

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.030 
in tourism too so I think they're
beginning<00:02:39.660> to<00:02:39.900> see<00:02:39.959> wildlife<00:02:40.500> for<00:02:40.980> the

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
beginning to see wildlife for the

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.220 
beginning to see wildlife for the
ecological<00:02:41.400> value<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.269> it<00:02:42.420> had<00:02:42.629> and<00:02:42.959> the

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
ecological value that it had and the

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.339 
ecological value that it had and the
traditional<00:02:43.739> but<00:02:44.310> also<00:02:44.370> in<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.819> new<00:02:44.940> sense

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
traditional but also in the new sense

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.210 
traditional but also in the new sense
tourism<00:02:46.349> which<00:02:46.470> wasn't<00:02:46.680> there<00:02:46.890> before

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
tourism which wasn't there before

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.710 
tourism which wasn't there before
so<00:02:48.170> rebuilding<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.230> pride<00:02:49.470> as<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.670> said<00:02:50.879> does

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
so rebuilding the pride as you said does

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.530 
so rebuilding the pride as you said does
take<00:02:52.079> that<00:02:52.290> approach<00:02:52.640> it<00:02:54.079> tries<00:02:55.079> to<00:02:55.560> emphasize

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
take that approach it tries to emphasize

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.319 
take that approach it tries to emphasize
them<00:02:57.540> use<00:02:57.870> as<00:02:58.260> much<00:02:58.879> traditional<00:02:59.879> knowledge

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
them use as much traditional knowledge

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.900 
them use as much traditional knowledge
and<00:03:00.660> promote<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:01.859> tradition<00:03:02.340> ology<00:03:02.730> say

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
and promote that tradition ology say

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.910 
and promote that tradition ology say
look<00:03:03.150> our<00:03:03.390> conservation<00:03:03.989> solutions<00:03:04.230> don't

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
look our conservation solutions don't

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.039 
look our conservation solutions don't
have<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.370> come<00:03:05.579> from<00:03:05.819> outside<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.660> best

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
have to come from outside the best

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.660 
have to come from outside the best
people<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.940> decide<00:03:08.940> how<00:03:09.799> lions<00:03:10.799> and<00:03:11.069> zebra<00:03:11.549> and

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
people to decide how lions and zebra and

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.130 
people to decide how lions and zebra and
wildebeest<00:03:11.819> should<00:03:12.299> be<00:03:12.420> conserved<00:03:12.840> in<00:03:12.989> this

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
wildebeest should be conserved in this

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.900 
wildebeest should be conserved in this
area<00:03:13.440> you<00:03:13.620> guys<00:03:13.829> as<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.069> community<00:03:14.640> you've

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
area you guys as a community you've

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.140 
area you guys as a community you've
lived<00:03:15.629> alongside<00:03:16.019> lions<00:03:16.890> for<00:03:17.609> thousands<00:03:18.090> of

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
lived alongside lions for thousands of

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.930 
lived alongside lions for thousands of
years<00:03:18.769> how<00:03:19.769> have<00:03:19.950> you<00:03:20.069> managed<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.519> do<00:03:20.730> that

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
years how have you managed to do that

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.870 
years how have you managed to do that
what<00:03:21.440> what<00:03:22.440> secrets<00:03:23.239> can<00:03:24.239> we<00:03:24.389> gain<00:03:24.690> from

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
what what secrets can we gain from

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.809 
what what secrets can we gain from
tapping<00:03:26.880> into<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.680> long<00:03:28.680> history<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:29.669> so

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
tapping into that long history and so

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.430 
tapping into that long history and so
that<00:03:30.000> is<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.150> story<00:03:30.389> that<00:03:30.510> is<00:03:30.660> powerful<00:03:30.989> that

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
that is a story that is powerful that

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.199 
that is a story that is powerful that
people<00:03:31.500> are<00:03:31.919> able<00:03:32.010> to<00:03:32.220> live<00:03:32.519> with<00:03:32.940> animals

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
people are able to live with animals

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.020 
people are able to live with animals
with<00:03:33.900> wild<00:03:34.230> animals<00:03:34.380> not<00:03:34.799> just<00:03:34.980> animals<00:03:35.250> that

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
with wild animals not just animals that

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.300 
with wild animals not just animals that
are<00:03:36.180> capable<00:03:36.660> of<00:03:36.810> killing<00:03:37.290> people<00:03:37.620> not<00:03:38.280> only

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
are capable of killing people not only

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.250 
are capable of killing people not only
cows<00:03:39.079> but<00:03:40.079> have<00:03:40.889> found<00:03:41.130> friendship<00:03:41.669> in<00:03:41.819> them

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
cows but have found friendship in them

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.800 
cows but have found friendship in them
so<00:03:43.260> that<00:03:43.470> that<00:03:43.500> really<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:44.519> think<00:03:44.579> is<00:03:44.970> what<00:03:45.269> you

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
so that that really I think is what you

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.839 
so that that really I think is what you
know<00:03:45.930> keep<00:03:46.139> the<00:03:46.260> interest<00:03:46.650> here<00:03:47.010> know<00:03:47.700> in

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
know keep the interest here know in

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.930 
know keep the interest here know in
populations<00:03:48.510> all<00:03:48.690> over<00:03:48.870> Africa<00:03:49.410> have<00:03:49.590> been

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
populations all over Africa have been

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.449 
populations all over Africa have been
rapidly<00:03:51.940> collapsing<00:03:52.270> for<00:03:53.080> the<00:03:53.140> last<00:03:53.430> 50<00:03:54.430> years

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
rapidly collapsing for the last 50 years

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.390 
rapidly collapsing for the last 50 years
Kenya's<00:03:55.150> no<00:03:55.390> exception<00:03:56.380> our<00:03:57.040> lion

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
Kenya's no exception our lion

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.160 
Kenya's no exception our lion
populations<00:03:58.090> are<00:03:58.360> down<00:03:58.480> to<00:03:58.720> about<00:03:58.870> two

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
populations are down to about two

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.030 
populations are down to about two
thousand<00:03:59.910> so<00:04:00.910> it's<00:04:00.940> it<00:04:01.780> really<00:04:02.080> is<00:04:02.170> amazing<00:04:02.530> to

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
thousand so it's it really is amazing to

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.270 
thousand so it's it really is amazing to
have<00:04:03.489> a<00:04:03.520> lion<00:04:03.849> population<00:04:04.599> that<00:04:04.720> is<00:04:04.900> growing

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
have a lion population that is growing

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.699 
have a lion population that is growing
what<00:04:06.280> elsewhere<00:04:06.819> in<00:04:06.940> Kenya<00:04:07.420> lion<00:04:08.080> populations

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
what elsewhere in Kenya lion populations

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.910 
what elsewhere in Kenya lion populations
continue<00:04:09.190> to<00:04:09.340> decrease<00:04:09.630> what<00:04:10.630> makes<00:04:11.020> it<00:04:11.290> even

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
continue to decrease what makes it even

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.949 
continue to decrease what makes it even
more<00:04:12.400> incredible<00:04:12.940> is<00:04:13.060> that<00:04:13.120> we're<00:04:13.569> not<00:04:13.690> in<00:04:13.870> a

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
more incredible is that we're not in a

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.009 
more incredible is that we're not in a
national<00:04:14.410> park<00:04:14.590> right<00:04:15.430> well<00:04:16.180> what's<00:04:16.810> the

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
national park right well what's the

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.670 
national park right well what's the
reason<00:04:17.320> for<00:04:17.350> that<00:04:17.620> again<00:04:17.829> it<00:04:18.100> comes<00:04:18.519> back<00:04:18.820> to

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
reason for that again it comes back to

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.900 
reason for that again it comes back to
community<00:04:20.680> but<00:04:20.829> it's<00:04:20.950> conservation<00:04:21.220> it<00:04:21.700> was

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:29.700 
want the same thing but look ahead 10 15
20<00:05:27.250> years<00:05:27.460> the<00:05:28.390> value<00:05:28.870> of<00:05:28.960> livestock<00:05:29.169> is<00:05:29.530> not

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
20 years the value of livestock is not

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.130 
20 years the value of livestock is not
going<00:05:29.860> to<00:05:29.919> increase<00:05:30.220> the<00:05:31.210> value<00:05:31.419> of<00:05:31.660> wildlife

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
going to increase the value of wildlife

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.659 
going to increase the value of wildlife
on<00:05:32.289> the<00:05:32.410> international<00:05:32.860> market<00:05:33.160> is<00:05:33.250> gonna<00:05:33.460> go

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
on the international market is gonna go

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.010 
on the international market is gonna go
through<00:05:34.030> the<00:05:34.180> ceiling<00:05:34.570> because<00:05:34.750> there's

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
through the ceiling because there's

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.810 
through the ceiling because there's
going<00:05:35.140> to<00:05:35.200> be<00:05:35.260> less<00:05:35.500> and<00:05:35.680> less<00:05:35.800> of<00:05:35.979> it<00:05:36.160> so<00:05:36.669> we're

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
going to be less and less of it so we're

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:37.880 
going to be less and less of it so we're
gonna<00:05:36.910> have<00:05:37.150> to<00:05:37.180> go<00:05:37.330> through<00:05:37.570> this<00:05:37.630> transition

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890 
gonna have to go through this transition

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.310 
gonna have to go through this transition
where<00:05:38.890> the<00:05:38.919> Masai<00:05:39.460> who<00:05:40.000> could<00:05:40.150> no<00:05:40.270> longer

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
where the Masai who could no longer

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.080 
where the Masai who could no longer
survive<00:05:41.320> on<00:05:41.500> livestock<00:05:41.860> in<00:05:42.039> any<00:05:42.190> event<00:05:42.490> make

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
survive on livestock in any event make

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.700 
survive on livestock in any event make
that<00:05:43.300> transition<00:05:43.780> to<00:05:44.020> find<00:05:44.320> a<00:05:44.470> new

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
that transition to find a new

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.370 
that transition to find a new
combination<00:05:45.400> of<00:05:46.080> wildlife<00:05:47.080> and<00:05:47.350> livestock

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
combination of wildlife and livestock

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.580 
combination of wildlife and livestock
and<00:05:48.070> I<00:05:48.460> think<00:05:48.700> they<00:05:49.270> will<00:05:49.419> still<00:05:49.690> continue<00:05:50.560> to

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
and I think they will still continue to

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.620 
and I think they will still continue to
see<00:05:50.710> livestock<00:05:51.310> as<00:05:51.460> something<00:05:51.789> symbolic<00:05:52.030> and

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
see livestock as something symbolic and

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.170 
see livestock as something symbolic and
and<00:05:52.870> cultural<00:05:53.710> but<00:05:54.370> a<00:05:54.400> very<00:05:54.789> and<00:05:55.090> an
