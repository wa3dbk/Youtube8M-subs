00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:24.519 
talk about this beacon right here and

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:26.550 
talk about this beacon right here and
why<00:00:24.640> is<00:00:24.699> not<00:00:24.970> on<00:00:25.150> first<00:00:25.840> off<00:00:25.990> it<00:00:26.199> on<00:00:26.380> stuff

underground you could you gotta have a

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.970 
underground you could you gotta have a
way<00:00:28.390> to<00:00:28.449> go<00:00:28.660> like<00:00:28.929> this<00:00:29.140> like<00:00:29.410> I<00:00:29.769> show<00:00:29.890> you

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
right here you got to go all the way up

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.700 
right here you got to go all the way up
which<00:00:31.390> is<00:00:31.509> pretty<00:00:31.869> normal<00:00:32.080> most<00:00:32.379> everything

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
which is pretty normal most everything

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.470 
which is pretty normal most everything
and<00:00:33.010> if<00:00:33.489> you<00:00:33.640> look<00:00:33.790> up<00:00:33.940> on<00:00:34.030> this<00:00:34.149> one<00:00:34.360> right

and if you look up on this one right
here<00:00:34.540> let's<00:00:35.200> go<00:00:35.320> after<00:00:35.530> you<00:00:35.590> make<00:00:35.739> this<00:00:35.890> beacon

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
here let's go after you make this beacon

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.040 
here let's go after you make this beacon
um<00:00:36.550> you're<00:00:36.879> going<00:00:36.969> to<00:00:37.059> know<00:00:37.180> that<00:00:37.390> I<00:00:37.420> do<00:00:37.540> have<00:00:38.020> a

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
um you're going to know that I do have a

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.170 
um you're going to know that I do have a
way<00:00:38.649> to<00:00:38.710> go<00:00:38.980> up<00:00:39.160> there<00:00:39.460> is<00:00:39.579> a<00:00:39.610> way<00:00:39.789> to<00:00:39.820> go<00:00:40.000> up<00:00:40.090> and

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
way to go up there is a way to go up and

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.520 
way to go up there is a way to go up and
you're<00:00:40.270> probably<00:00:40.420> wondering<00:00:40.840> why<00:00:41.050> it<00:00:41.110> does

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
you're probably wondering why it does

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.260 
you're probably wondering why it does
that<00:00:41.559> well<00:00:41.860> the<00:00:42.190> thing<00:00:42.370> is<00:00:42.399> is<00:00:42.730> that<00:00:42.820> sometimes

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
that well the thing is is that sometimes

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.060 
that well the thing is is that sometimes
it<00:00:43.480> glitches<00:00:43.750> in<00:00:44.050> this<00:00:44.289> thing<00:00:44.500> which<00:00:44.890> actually

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
it glitches in this thing which actually

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.590 
it glitches in this thing which actually
is<00:00:45.280> a<00:00:45.340> good<00:00:45.489> thing<00:00:45.640> sometimes<00:00:45.910> because<00:00:46.210> what

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
is a good thing sometimes because what

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.389 
is a good thing sometimes because what
I'm<00:00:46.690> about<00:00:46.780> to<00:00:46.930> show<00:00:47.110> you<00:00:47.140> is<00:00:47.289> basically<00:00:47.800> how

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
I'm about to show you is basically how

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.819 
I'm about to show you is basically how
to<00:00:48.460> make<00:00:48.699> it<00:00:48.879> extend<00:00:49.420> way<00:00:49.690> farther<00:00:50.020> and<00:00:50.320> a<00:00:50.590> new

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
to make it extend way farther and a new

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:52.740 
to make it extend way farther and a new
texture<00:00:51.640> on<00:00:51.879> it<00:00:51.910> whenever<00:00:52.180> it<00:00:52.449> goes<00:00:52.539> so

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
texture on it whenever it goes so

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.849 
texture on it whenever it goes so
basically<00:00:53.079> what<00:00:53.230> you<00:00:53.320> want<00:00:53.379> to<00:00:53.469> do<00:00:53.559> is<00:00:53.680> set<00:00:53.829> it

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:53.859 
basically what you want to do is set it

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:54.990 
basically what you want to do is set it
up<00:00:54.070> it<00:00:54.160> doesn't<00:00:54.219> matter<00:00:54.489> what<00:00:54.579> block<00:00:54.760> it<00:00:54.910> is

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
up it doesn't matter what block it is

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.979 
up it doesn't matter what block it is
i'm<00:00:55.090> just<00:00:55.270> using<00:00:55.390> diamond<00:00:55.690> because<00:00:55.809> i<00:00:55.870> like

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
i'm just using diamond because i like

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.569 
i'm just using diamond because i like
them<00:00:56.140> and<00:00:56.260> you're<00:00:56.739> gonna<00:00:56.829> want<00:00:57.039> to<00:00:57.100> do<00:00:57.550> a

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
them and you're gonna want to do a

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:58.979 
them and you're gonna want to do a
regular<00:00:57.789> beacon<00:00:58.149> okay<00:00:58.329> once<00:00:58.780> you<00:00:58.840> do<00:00:58.960> a

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
regular beacon okay once you do a

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:00.900 
regular beacon okay once you do a
regular<00:00:59.170> beacon<00:00:59.500> is<00:00:59.590> going<00:00:59.620> to<00:00:59.829> power<00:01:00.250> on<00:01:00.550> you

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
regular beacon is going to power on you

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.910 
regular beacon is going to power on you
know<00:01:01.030> which<00:01:01.420> when<00:01:01.719> everyone's<00:01:02.050> now<00:01:02.170> on<00:01:02.379> it's

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
know which when everyone's now on it's

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.590 
know which when everyone's now on it's
got<00:01:03.039> a<00:01:03.070> power<00:01:03.309> on<00:01:03.460> and<00:01:03.820> then<00:01:04.180> what's<00:01:04.390> going<00:01:04.540> to

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
got a power on and then what's going to

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.640 
got a power on and then what's going to
happen<00:01:04.750> you<00:01:04.780> want<00:01:05.080> to<00:01:05.140> destroy<00:01:05.380> everything

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
happen you want to destroy everything

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.710 
happen you want to destroy everything
destroy<00:01:06.100> it<00:01:06.220> is<00:01:06.370> going<00:01:06.580> to<00:01:06.640> extend<00:01:06.880> see<00:01:07.330> so

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
destroy it is going to extend see so

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.180 
destroy it is going to extend see so
what<00:01:07.900> happens<00:01:08.200> is<00:01:08.290> that<00:01:08.320> the<00:01:08.500> bottom<00:01:08.620> of<00:01:08.890> comes

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
what happens is that the bottom of comes

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.560 
what happens is that the bottom of comes
up<00:01:09.370> and<00:01:09.520> you're<00:01:09.700> going<00:01:09.790> to<00:01:09.910> actually<00:01:10.030> see<00:01:10.450> it

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
up and you're going to actually see it

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.110 
up and you're going to actually see it
see<00:01:11.080> me<00:01:11.230> go<00:01:11.380> fly<00:01:11.770> up<00:01:12.010> and<00:01:12.250> everything<00:01:12.640> what's

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
see me go fly up and everything what's

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.300 
see me go fly up and everything what's
called<00:01:13.330> an<00:01:13.510> actual<00:01:13.840> ease<00:01:13.930> um<00:01:14.200> it<00:01:14.710> goes<00:01:14.860> way

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
called an actual ease um it goes way

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.430 
called an actual ease um it goes way
higher<00:01:15.340> than<00:01:15.940> the<00:01:16.450> original<00:01:16.960> way<00:01:17.050> I<00:01:17.080> think

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
higher than the original way I think

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.110 
higher than the original way I think
it's<00:01:17.560> like<00:01:17.650> doubles<00:01:18.130> it<00:01:18.310> as<00:01:18.460> what<00:01:18.760> it<00:01:18.940> would<00:01:19.090> be

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
it's like doubles it as what it would be

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.700 
it's like doubles it as what it would be
if<00:01:19.570> it<00:01:19.720> had<00:01:19.870> two<00:01:20.110> of<00:01:20.140> them<00:01:20.320> you<00:01:20.440> know<00:01:20.560> him

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
if it had two of them you know him
