00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890

great<00:00:29.010> for<00:00:29.279> summer<00:00:29.550> or<00:00:29.820> spring<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.840> formal<00:00:31.170> is

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
great for summer or spring the formal is

a<00:00:31.289> bit<00:00:31.529> running<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:32.160> can<00:00:32.369> do<00:00:32.489> two<00:00:32.700> coats<00:00:32.969> but<00:00:33.630> i

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
a bit running you can do two coats but i

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.360 
a bit running you can do two coats but i
think<00:00:33.989> three<00:00:34.230> coats<00:00:34.469> will<00:00:34.710> be<00:00:34.860> better
