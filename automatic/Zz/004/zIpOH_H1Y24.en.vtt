00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
ice you want to do ISO overnight because

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.870 
ice you want to do ISO overnight because
it<00:06:03.230> really<00:06:03.560> just<00:06:03.740> fuck's<00:06:03.980> up<00:06:04.160> your<00:06:04.220> internet

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.490 
and also it just makes you just mix
everything<00:06:07.340> slower<00:06:07.940> and<00:06:08.330> it<00:06:08.480> takes<00:06:08.750> like<00:06:09.440> a

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
everything slower and it takes like a

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.960 
everything slower and it takes like a
few<00:06:09.740> hours<00:06:09.770> you<00:06:10.280> don't<00:06:10.580> want<00:06:10.700> to<00:06:10.760> be<00:06:10.850> in<00:06:10.910> the
