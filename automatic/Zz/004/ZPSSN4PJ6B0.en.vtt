00:00:18.056 --> 00:00:20.715
 Now it's over. 

00:00:20.857 --> 00:00:24.306
 Inside I know. 

00:00:25.577 --> 00:00:29.520
 No one will ever know. 

00:00:30.724 --> 00:00:35.485
 The melancholy tale of Nightmare Moon ... 

00:00:35.865 --> 00:00:38.586
 and of those who died. 

00:00:39.212 --> 00:00:43.919
 No one should know. 

00:00:46.432 --> 00:00:51.793
 They only see the tragedy. 

00:00:53.163 --> 00:00:56.460
 They do not see my intention. 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.374
 The shadow of the evil of the night. 

00:01:03.154 --> 00:01:05.326
 It will forever kill ... 

00:01:05.597 --> 00:01:12.404
 The good that I meant. 

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:19.570
 Am I a good mare? 

00:01:20.603 --> 00:01:25.201
 Am I an insane mare? 

00:01:26.312 --> 00:01:28.947
 It's such a fine line, 

00:01:30.926 --> 00:01:38.997
 between a good mare and me. 

00:01:44.228 --> 00:01:50.118
 Did you really think I'd let you go? 

00:01:50.118 --> 00:01:55.779
 Did you think I would set you free? 

00:01:56.736 --> 00:02:02.782
 If you have thought so, I am sorry to inform you that it is not that simple. 

00:02:03.114 --> 00:02:08.946
 You'll never get rid of me! 

00:02:09.621 --> 00:02:12.205
 All that you are is a face in the mirror. 

00:02:12.205 --> 00:02:15.508
 I close my eyes and you disappear. 

00:02:15.673 --> 00:02:18.294
 I am what you face when you look in the mirror. 

00:02:18.294 --> 00:02:21.620
 As long as you live, I'll still be here. 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.482
 All that you are is the end of a nightmare. 

00:02:24.482 --> 00:02:27.228
 Whatever you are, it's an agonizing cry. 

00:02:27.376 --> 00:02:33.237
 After tonight I will end this demonic dream! 

00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:39.219
 This is not a dream my dear and it will never end! 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:44.675
 This is a nightmare that will continue! 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:50.645
 I'm here to stay no matter what you want. 

00:02:51.507 --> 00:02:57.910
 And I will blossom soon after you are gone! 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.731
 Soon you will die and my silence will hide you. 

00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:03.415
 You can not choose apart from losing control. 

00:03:03.586 --> 00:03:06.509
 You can not control me, I live deep inside you. 

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:09.627
 Every day you feel me devour your soul. 

00:03:09.627 --> 00:03:12.301
 I do not need you to survive, as you need me. 

00:03:12.301 --> 00:03:15.158
 I will become complete as you dance with death. 

00:03:15.334 --> 00:03:21.322
 And I will rejoice as soon as you give your last breath. 

00:03:21.322 --> 00:03:25.697
 "I'll live inside you forever!" 

00:03:25.697 --> 00:03:26.741
 "I'll live inside you forever!" - Not! 

00:03:27.318 --> 00:03:31.399
 "With your own Darkness beside me!" 

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:32.323
 "With your own Darkness beside me!" - Not! 

00:03:32.323 --> 00:03:44.868
 And I know now and forever they will never be able to separate Luna from the Night! 

00:03:45.073 --> 00:03:49.021
 Can not you see that ... now it's over? 

00:03:49.026 --> 00:03:50.722
 It's time to die! 

00:03:50.722 --> 00:03:53.842
 No not me. Only you! 

00:03:54.002 --> 00:03:56.905
 If I die, you die too! 

00:03:57.058 --> 00:04:00.049
 You will die in me, I will be you! 

00:04:00.367 --> 00:04:03.287
 Damn Night! Set me free! 

00:04:03.455 --> 00:04:06.720
 Can not you see? You are me! 

00:04:07.056 --> 00:04:10.397
 Not! Deep inside... 

00:04:10.397 --> 00:04:13.634
 I am you! You're the Night! 

00:04:13.972 --> 00:04:16.929
 - No, never! - Yes always! 

00:04:17.552 --> 00:04:19.461
 Damn it, Nightmare! 

00:04:19.461 --> 00:04:22.340
 Take your evil intentions and rot in Tartarus! 

00:04:23.105 --> 00:04:25.198
 I'll see you there, Luna! 

00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:26.498
 Never! 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:55.462
