right against that cylinder wall which
is<00:00:46.909> why<00:00:47.030> it's<00:00:47.210> important<00:00:47.629> when<00:00:47.720> you<00:00:47.809> put<00:00:47.989> your

is why it's important when you put your
solder<00:00:48.320> into<00:00:48.680> the<00:00:48.769> spark<00:00:49.040> plug<00:00:49.250> hole<00:00:49.370> into<00:00:49.699> the

engine you want to make sure you do it

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:52.990 
engine you want to make sure you do it
in<00:00:52.010> a<00:00:52.100> way<00:00:52.220> that<00:00:52.370> you<00:00:52.489> get<00:00:52.610> it<00:00:52.729> right<00:00:52.970> up

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
in a way that you get it right up

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.579 
in a way that you get it right up
against<00:00:53.420> that<00:00:53.540> cylinder<00:00:53.960> wall<00:00:54.229> to<00:00:54.350> get<00:00:54.470> an

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
against that cylinder wall to get an

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:58.090 
against that cylinder wall to get an
accurate<00:00:54.739> measurement<00:00:56.739> and<00:00:57.739> when<00:00:57.949> you're

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
accurate measurement and when you're

setting up the squish it's not enough

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.250 
setting up the squish it's not enough
just<00:01:01.610> to<00:01:02.000> make<00:01:02.239> sure<00:01:02.420> that<00:01:02.720> the<00:01:02.839> piston

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
just to make sure that the piston

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.649 
just to make sure that the piston
doesn't<00:01:03.619> contact<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:04.879> cylinder<00:01:05.330> head<00:01:05.479> when

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
doesn't contact the cylinder head when

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:06.850 
doesn't contact the cylinder head when
you're<00:01:05.750> turning<00:01:05.930> it<00:01:06.110> over<00:01:06.290> by<00:01:06.409> hand<00:01:06.650> or

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
you're turning it over by hand or

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.310 
you're turning it over by hand or
kicking<00:01:07.070> it<00:01:07.250> over<00:01:07.420> you<00:01:08.420> actually<00:01:08.780> need<00:01:08.930> to<00:01:08.960> set

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
kicking it over you actually need to set

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.029 
kicking it over you actually need to set
it<00:01:09.469> to<00:01:10.030> minimum<00:01:11.030> clearances<00:01:11.619> because<00:01:12.619> the

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:13.039 
it to minimum clearances because the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:14.709 
it to minimum clearances because the
connecting<00:01:13.549> rod<00:01:13.729> will<00:01:13.939> stretch<00:01:14.329> in<00:01:14.570> higher

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:14.719 
connecting rod will stretch in higher

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:16.719 
connecting rod will stretch in higher
rpms<00:01:15.289> and<00:01:15.649> then<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:15.859> piston<00:01:16.219> will<00:01:16.340> be<00:01:16.430> coming

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
rpms and then the piston will be coming

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.910 
rpms and then the piston will be coming
closer<00:01:16.969> to<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:17.240> head<00:01:17.479> so<00:01:18.200> if<00:01:18.289> you've<00:01:18.439> got<00:01:18.649> just

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
closer to the head so if you've got just

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.560 
closer to the head so if you've got just
a<00:01:19.070> tiny<00:01:19.250> bit<00:01:19.460> of<00:01:19.579> clearance<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:20.060> piston<00:01:20.390> might

a tiny bit of clearance the piston might

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.599 
a tiny bit of clearance the piston might
still<00:01:20.869> hit<00:01:21.049> the<00:01:21.170> head<00:01:21.350> when<00:01:22.130> it<00:01:22.250> gets<00:01:22.399> to<00:01:22.579> a

removing the spark plug wire and spark
plug<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.750> then<00:02:55.350> you<00:02:55.470> need<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.740> bend<00:02:55.890> the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
plug and then you need to bend the

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.850 
plug and then you need to bend the
solder<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:57.300> kind<00:02:57.630> of<00:02:57.720> an<00:02:57.810> L<00:02:57.930> shape<00:02:58.260> like<00:02:58.830> you

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
solder and kind of an L shape like you

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.310 
solder and kind of an L shape like you
see<00:02:59.130> here<00:02:59.490> that<00:03:00.270> way<00:03:00.420> you<00:03:00.450> can<00:03:00.750> maneuver<00:03:01.290> it

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
see here that way you can maneuver it

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.690 
see here that way you can maneuver it
into<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.650> cylinder<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:02.280> get<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.490> right<00:03:02.670> up

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
into the cylinder and get it right up

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.330 
into the cylinder and get it right up
against<00:03:03.210> the<00:03:03.300> edge<00:03:03.420> of<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.630> cylinder<00:03:03.840> wall

like<00:03:05.340> I<00:03:05.430> showed<00:03:05.610> you<00:03:05.760> before<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:08.210> hopefully

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
like I showed you before and hopefully

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.280 
like I showed you before and hopefully
you've<00:03:09.330> got<00:03:09.510> enough<00:03:09.750> left<00:03:10.020> that<00:03:10.140> you<00:03:10.260> can

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
you've got enough left that you can

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.100 
you've got enough left that you can
easily<00:03:10.740> hold<00:03:10.890> it<00:03:11.070> outside<00:03:11.430> of<00:03:11.490> the<00:03:11.640> cylinder

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
easily hold it outside of the cylinder

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.390 
easily hold it outside of the cylinder
so<00:03:13.110> get<00:03:13.260> that<00:03:13.290> in<00:03:13.470> there<00:03:13.740> and<00:03:13.860> get<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:14.070> right<00:03:14.250> up

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
so get that in there and get it right up

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.790 
so get that in there and get it right up
against<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.820> edge<00:03:14.850> of<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.150> cylinder<00:03:15.360> wall<00:03:15.800> up

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
at the top of the cylinder and hold on

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.780 
at the top of the cylinder and hold on
to<00:03:19.530> them<00:03:19.590> obviously<00:03:19.860> make<00:03:20.280> sure<00:03:20.310> none<00:03:20.610> of<00:03:20.700> your

to them obviously make sure none of your
fingers<00:03:21.090> are<00:03:21.240> in<00:03:21.360> there<00:03:22.070> and<00:03:23.070> then<00:03:23.220> you'll

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
fingers are in there and then you'll

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.000 
fingers are in there and then you'll
need<00:03:23.490> to<00:03:23.640> either<00:03:23.730> kick<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.180> over<00:03:24.510> or<00:03:24.830> use<00:03:25.830> the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
need to either kick it over or use the

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.430 
need to either kick it over or use the
electric<00:03:26.400> starter<00:03:26.820> to<00:03:27.660> turn<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.020> engine<00:03:28.320> over

a few times okay now you can remove the

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.540 
a few times okay now you can remove the
solder<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:36.770> you<00:03:37.770> should<00:03:37.950> see<00:03:38.130> that<00:03:38.160> it's<00:03:38.400> been

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
solder and you should see that it's been

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.110

your solder squished you'll need to

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.980 
your solder squished you'll need to
measure<00:03:43.920> it<00:03:44.160> at<00:03:44.250> its<00:03:44.400> thinnest<00:03:44.760> point<00:03:45.030> which

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
measure it at its thinnest point which

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.560 
measure it at its thinnest point which
is<00:03:46.200> usually<00:03:46.560> right<00:03:46.770> at<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.160> tip<00:03:47.340> of<00:03:47.520> it<00:03:50.570> and

ways<00:04:04.470> is<00:04:04.740> obviously<00:04:05.160> head<00:04:05.400> gaskets<00:04:05.910> you<00:04:06.870> can

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
ways is obviously head gaskets you can

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.900 
ways is obviously head gaskets you can
use<00:04:07.230> a<00:04:07.260> thicker<00:04:07.860> head<00:04:08.130> gasket<00:04:08.580> if<00:04:08.670> you<00:04:08.760> need

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
use a thicker head gasket if you need

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.900 
use a thicker head gasket if you need
more<00:04:09.090> clearance<00:04:09.740> for<00:04:10.740> example<00:04:11.190> a<00:04:11.610> lot<00:04:11.820> of

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
more clearance for example a lot of

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.760 
more clearance for example a lot of
stock<00:04:12.150> engines<00:04:12.600> come<00:04:12.810> with<00:04:12.959> these<00:04:13.050> copper

be very careful that you make this

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.930 
be very careful that you make this
surface<00:04:59.379> true<00:04:59.710> so<00:05:00.009> there's<00:05:00.190> no<00:05:00.340> high<00:05:00.550> and<00:05:00.789> low

more clearance another option would be

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
more clearance another option would be
to<00:05:17.979> use<00:05:19.470> additional<00:05:20.470> base<00:05:20.650> gaskets<00:05:22.919> or<00:05:23.919> you

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
to use additional base gaskets or you

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.600 
to use additional base gaskets or you
can<00:05:24.699> get<00:05:24.849> these<00:05:25.680> thin<00:05:26.680> aluminum<00:05:27.159> timing

gaskets you're gonna need to check your

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:51.450 
gaskets you're gonna need to check your
port<00:05:48.490> timing<00:05:48.880> again<00:05:49.889> you<00:05:50.889> can<00:05:51.039> do<00:05:51.130> that<00:05:51.279> with<00:05:51.430> a

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.610 
that you can take the measurements and
they'll<00:05:56.229> calculate<00:05:56.740> your<00:05:56.830> port<00:05:57.069> timings<00:05:57.490> but

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
they'll calculate your port timings but

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.249 
they'll calculate your port timings but
if<00:05:59.620> you<00:05:59.770> have<00:05:59.949> specific<00:06:00.130> timings<00:06:00.819> in<00:06:00.969> mind

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:01.259 
if you have specific timings in mind

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:03.540 
if you have specific timings in mind
especially<00:06:02.259> if<00:06:02.740> you<00:06:02.800> make<00:06:02.919> much<00:06:03.159> of<00:06:03.190> a<00:06:03.370> change

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
especially if you make much of a change

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.980 
especially if you make much of a change
it's<00:06:03.849> very<00:06:04.060> important<00:06:04.419> to<00:06:04.509> check<00:06:04.630> your<00:06:04.690> port

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
it's very important to check your port

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.709 
it's very important to check your port
timings<00:06:05.380> to<00:06:05.529> make<00:06:05.680> sure<00:06:05.830> they're<00:06:06.039> still<00:06:06.250> right

00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:06.719 
timings to make sure they're still right

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:09.240 
timings to make sure they're still right
because<00:06:07.719> any<00:06:07.990> time<00:06:08.199> you<00:06:08.319> raise<00:06:08.529> the<00:06:08.800> cylinder

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
because any time you raise the cylinder

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.010 
because any time you raise the cylinder
you're<00:06:09.699> gonna<00:06:09.819> make<00:06:10.090> the<00:06:10.210> durations<00:06:10.719> a<00:06:10.810> little

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
you're gonna make the durations a little

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.050 
you're gonna make the durations a little
longer<00:06:12.479> any<00:06:13.479> time<00:06:13.750> you<00:06:13.930> lower<00:06:14.199> the<00:06:14.440> cylinder

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
longer any time you lower the cylinder

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.370 
longer any time you lower the cylinder
for<00:06:16.060> example<00:06:16.479> if<00:06:16.569> you<00:06:16.690> took<00:06:16.840> out<00:06:17.020> the<00:06:17.080> base

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
for example if you took out the base

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.890 
for example if you took out the base
gasket<00:06:17.590> and<00:06:18.009> tried<00:06:18.190> to<00:06:18.219> run<00:06:18.400> a<00:06:18.460> our<00:06:19.210> TV<00:06:19.599> or<00:06:19.750> some

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
gasket and tried to run a our TV or some

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.680 
gasket and tried to run a our TV or some
kind<00:06:20.080> of<00:06:20.139> sealant<00:06:20.500> down<00:06:20.650> there<00:06:21.449> then<00:06:22.449> you

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
kind of sealant down there then you

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.529 
kind of sealant down there then you
would<00:06:22.840> make<00:06:23.050> the<00:06:23.289> the<00:06:24.219> poor<00:06:24.460> timings<00:06:24.909> a<00:06:25.180> little

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:25.539 
would make the the poor timings a little

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:28.140 
would make the the poor timings a little
less<00:06:26.009> so<00:06:27.009> it's<00:06:27.190> important<00:06:27.520> to<00:06:27.550> check<00:06:27.789> on<00:06:27.940> those

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
less so it's important to check on those

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.559 
less so it's important to check on those
if<00:06:28.630> you<00:06:29.469> have<00:06:29.680> a<00:06:30.130> cylinder<00:06:30.969> head<00:06:31.150> with<00:06:31.360> that

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:31.569 
if you have a cylinder head with that

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:34.439 
if you have a cylinder head with that
uses<00:06:31.900> an<00:06:32.020> o-ring<00:06:32.460> instead<00:06:33.460> of<00:06:33.550> the<00:06:33.669> the<00:06:34.210> flat

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:34.449 
uses an o-ring instead of the the flat

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:39.060 
uses an o-ring instead of the the flat
style<00:06:34.719> head<00:06:34.930> gasket<00:06:37.529> don't<00:06:38.529> really<00:06:38.770> work<00:06:38.919> with

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:39.070 
style head gasket don't really work with

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.269 
style head gasket don't really work with
you<00:06:39.190> much<00:06:39.430> but<00:06:39.699> you<00:06:40.180> can<00:06:40.210> mill<00:06:40.599> out<00:06:40.889> the<00:06:41.889> o-ring

00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:42.279 
you much but you can mill out the o-ring

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:43.520 
you much but you can mill out the o-ring
area<00:06:42.729> here

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
area here

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:47.270 
area here
and<00:06:43.830> then<00:06:44.670> use<00:06:45.500> standard<00:06:46.500> head<00:06:46.620> gasket<00:06:47.130> you

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 
and then use standard head gasket you

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.920 
and then use standard head gasket you
may<00:06:47.550> be<00:06:47.610> able<00:06:47.790> to<00:06:47.910> use<00:06:48.060> an<00:06:48.210> o-ring<00:06:48.360> and<00:06:48.750> the

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:48.930 
may be able to use an o-ring and the

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:50.330 
may be able to use an o-ring and the
standard<00:06:49.290> head<00:06:49.410> gasket<00:06:49.860> to<00:06:49.980> create<00:06:50.190> more

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 
standard head gasket to create more

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.540 
standard head gasket to create more
clearance<00:06:51.650> but<00:06:52.650> your<00:06:52.830> options<00:06:53.250> are<00:06:53.370> a<00:06:53.400> little

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:53.550 
clearance but your options are a little

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:54.920 
clearance but your options are a little
more<00:06:53.760> limited<00:06:54.210> it's<00:06:54.390> gonna<00:06:54.510> be<00:06:54.690> a<00:06:54.720> little

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
more limited it's gonna be a little

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.950 
more limited it's gonna be a little
trickier<00:06:55.560> with<00:06:55.740> those<00:06:55.920> then<00:06:56.430> with<00:06:56.610> the<00:06:56.960> just

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 
trickier with those then with the just

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.600 
trickier with those then with the just
the<00:06:58.050> flat<00:06:58.290> style<00:06:58.620> head<00:06:58.950> here<00:06:59.160> that<00:06:59.340> use<00:06:59.490> the

00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.610 
the flat style head here that use the

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.390 
the flat style head here that use the
flat<00:06:59.820> gaskets
