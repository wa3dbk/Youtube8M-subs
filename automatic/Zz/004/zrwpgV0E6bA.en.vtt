00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.460
 as cheers 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.720
 and well, welcome here to a 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.310
 new video and well then I bring you a 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.140
 bit of gta online a mission of 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.050
 survival and good since they saw the 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.000
 ls video title gta 5 could 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.800
 see back well jay and well then it's 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.540
 that what I was reading here in 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.900
 level that celebrating the edition 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.400
 New Yorker of the comicon zone let's say 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.590
 that the actor for the character of 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.120
 forest lends to franklin within the 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.370
 game confessed that he would have liked 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.440
 interpret thus the protagonist of gta 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.940
 san andreas but said feel calm 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.980
 about it then in these moments 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.410
 works with john mcclain the actor who 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.790
 he gave life precisely like this jane 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.350
 although font did not omit the details 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.550
 about whether every project fits the 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.170
 possibility that both are 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.079
 involved in downloadable content 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.479
 for big car 5 and why I have not 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.720
 said complement of banks and yale ok 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.610
 so then this confirms more or 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.160
 minus the theory I did with blue gamer 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.220
 that one of the contents and see from 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.869
 come back so the truth is that it is very 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.149
 probable it is very likely that that is the 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.740
 first downloadable content the masses 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:22.479
 they are asking people to be 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.450
 impatient to see like that has gone back 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.950
 then in this good way then 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.810
 we can maybe have the opportunity to 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.509
 experiment like that and maybe like a 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.719
 Billionaire well now that 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:37.539
 going back to grove street and let's say 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:40.000
 let's say of the way to revive maybe 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.610
 the past maybe it's just some 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.850
 some curious fact can be many 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.310
 things that involve the return of follows 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.340
 to the world of great fauto not what 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.289
 important here people is that there are let's say 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.319
 which is no more than a theory maybe 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.520
 already went to next to rumor 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:59.649
 let's say in the way that 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.259
 we could see it back we do not know 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.289
 how or when it will be very 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:08.289
 old that the theory would indicate that yes already 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.940
 I would be around 50 then and 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.819
 Well now maybe we could 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.799
 see it something like 'michael and franklin 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.810
 everything is young because of what it looks like but 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:19.030
 a collaboration between the two and 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.489
 counting that good then let's say that for 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.130
 I am the most interesting character in 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.560
 game of gta 5 and the truth is that it came out 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.480
 pretty well it would be very good that 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.610
 we could see back nothing but 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.220
 see rockstar's confirmation 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.040
 of this tlc that then do not leave us with 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.800
 You get it now, because of this 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.190
 matter and well then now I hope 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.960
 but the truth is that the return was 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.510
 was to enter is between follows and cloud 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.460
 speed the ls I wanted to see but then 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.320
 now yes that one of the things that 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.700
 they could mark the return is also 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.520
 well the fact that wall street 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.100
 in then in gta 5 not that we can go to 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.350
 the house of follows we can give you a role and 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.970
 well, that was like an index about 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.380
 of this not then we are not no 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.930
 we were really crazy was not crazy 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.160
 very big talk about if gay and 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.320
 well for the people who wanted 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.910
 see him back he was interested to know 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.959
 a little of what had happened to him at 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.840
 long history 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.580
 Well, they're just going to be able to 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.130
 confirm it soon I hope so I hope 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.560
 that do not take long with the ls and such 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.300
 about six months, I think more or less 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.560
 to the exit obviously counting the 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.040
 exit from north go to see and would have 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.780
 past this one and it's been a month but 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.730
 The truth is that I really hope I can 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.130
 see well now and back and think so 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.010
 see how many missions this 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.450
 small of the scene you already know that rockstar 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.090
 Well, it's the raffle with the s 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.470
 to anything and well that's a very 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.610
 good signal not for us since 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.700
 we will be able to enjoy an experience 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.950
 very very large if that's how the on the 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.470
 network line network division 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.510
 forgiveness prediction or that of the tandem or 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.099
 its of customary churches ok is 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.440
 good people remember to leave your lex and 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:04:00.750
