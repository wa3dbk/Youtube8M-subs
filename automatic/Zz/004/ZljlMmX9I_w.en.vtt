a minute in be set I mean it's not the

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
fastest vsat in the world but on the

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.330 
fastest vsat in the world but on the
opening<00:01:57.700> run<00:01:57.909> now<00:01:58.090> is<00:01:58.150> a<00:01:58.240> vsat<00:01:58.750> run<00:01:59.040> and<00:02:00.040> i'm

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
opening run now is a vsat run and i'm

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.190 
opening run now is a vsat run and i'm
using<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.820> sentry<00:02:01.420> gun<00:02:01.570> as<00:02:01.720> well<00:02:01.750> as<00:02:01.960> long<00:02:02.080> as

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
using the sentry gun as well as long as

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.899 
using the sentry gun as well as long as
the<00:02:02.259> lightning<00:02:02.619> strike<00:02:02.860> kill<00:02:03.520> streaks<00:02:03.790> are

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
the lightning strike kill streaks are

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.890 
the lightning strike kill streaks are
irrelevant<00:02:04.119> but<00:02:05.020> normally<00:02:05.860> i<00:02:05.890> would<00:02:06.220> not<00:02:06.460> even

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
irrelevant but normally i would not even

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.749 
irrelevant but normally i would not even
attempt<00:02:07.900> to<00:02:08.049> do<00:02:08.439> anything<00:02:08.860> without<00:02:09.159> hard<00:02:09.549> line

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
attempt to do anything without hard line

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.119 
attempt to do anything without hard line
because<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.060> for<00:02:10.869> me<00:02:10.989> it's<00:02:11.290> a<00:02:11.439> little<00:02:11.590> hard<00:02:11.950> to

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
because the for me it's a little hard to

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.089 
because the for me it's a little hard to
get<00:02:12.250> some<00:02:12.459> of<00:02:12.549> the<00:02:12.610> killstreaks<00:02:13.769> well<00:02:14.769> to<00:02:14.980> get

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
get some of the killstreaks well to get

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.319 
get some of the killstreaks well to get
come<00:02:15.279> get<00:02:15.609> some<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.849> the<00:02:15.909> killstreaks

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
come get some of the killstreaks

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.030 
come get some of the killstreaks
consistently<00:02:16.930> so<00:02:17.079> I<00:02:17.109> felt<00:02:17.349> like<00:02:17.439> hardline<00:02:17.859> was

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
consistently so I felt like hardline was

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.930 
consistently so I felt like hardline was
needed<00:02:18.370> but<00:02:18.790> I

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
needed but I

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.820 
needed but I

you can move that with the adjustable

that<00:02:33.040> is<00:02:33.220> like<00:02:33.640> our<00:02:34.320> because<00:02:35.320> like<00:02:35.500> I<00:02:35.650> want<00:02:35.920> to

that is like our because like I want to

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.620 
that is like our because like I want to

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
do the primary gunfighter actually I am

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.030 
do the primary gunfighter actually I am
doing<00:02:37.960> the<00:02:38.050> primary<00:02:38.440> gunfighter<00:02:38.560> at<00:02:38.950> this

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
doing the primary gunfighter at this

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.090 
doing the primary gunfighter at this
point<00:02:39.280> actually<00:02:40.060> drop<00:02:40.300> toughness<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.100> it

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
point actually drop toughness and it

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.310 
point actually drop toughness and it
might<00:02:42.310> seem<00:02:42.550> stupid<00:02:42.820> but<00:02:43.180> I<00:02:43.390> find<00:02:44.020> that<00:02:44.170> the

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
might seem stupid but I find that the

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.380 
might seem stupid but I find that the
weapons<00:02:44.710> that<00:02:44.830> are<00:02:44.950> like<00:02:45.100> semi<00:02:45.400> auto<00:02:45.640> or<00:02:45.970> like

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
weapons that are like semi auto or like

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.420 
weapons that are like semi auto or like
three<00:02:46.720> round<00:02:46.930> burst<00:02:47.170> don't<00:02:47.740> need<00:02:47.920> toughness

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
three round burst don't need toughness

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.250 
three round burst don't need toughness
as<00:02:48.580> much<00:02:48.880> as<00:02:49.030> weapons<00:02:49.300> that<00:02:49.720> are<00:02:49.930> fully

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
as much as weapons that are fully

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.320 
as much as weapons that are fully
automatic<00:02:50.860> like<00:02:51.520> the<00:02:51.670> lighter<00:02:51.880> damage

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
automatic like the lighter damage

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.540 
automatic like the lighter damage
weapons<00:02:52.660> such<00:02:52.780> as<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:53.020> m27<00:02:53.710> and<00:02:54.130> like<00:02:54.340> the

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
weapons such as the m27 and like the

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.970 
weapons such as the m27 and like the
type<00:02:54.760> 25<00:02:54.970> those<00:02:55.600> weapons<00:02:55.840> i<00:02:56.200> find<00:02:56.500> toughness

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
type 25 those weapons i find toughness

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.730 
type 25 those weapons i find toughness
is<00:02:57.130> almost<00:02:57.460> mandatory<00:02:58.020> because<00:02:59.020> they<00:02:59.440> have<00:02:59.650> to

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
is almost mandatory because they have to

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.740 
is almost mandatory because they have to
have<00:02:59.860> such<00:03:00.040> a<00:03:00.070> low<00:03:00.310> bullet<00:03:00.670> damage<00:03:00.790> that<00:03:01.570> you

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
have such a low bullet damage that you

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.420 
have such a low bullet damage that you
can't<00:03:01.990> really<00:03:02.200> get<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.650> bullets<00:03:02.980> off<00:03:03.100> to<00:03:03.250> kill

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
can't really get the bullets off to kill

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.830 
can't really get the bullets off to kill
them<00:03:03.610> where<00:03:03.730> is<00:03:03.820> the<00:03:03.940> stronger<00:03:04.210> weapons<00:03:04.690> such

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
them where is the stronger weapons such

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.100 
them where is the stronger weapons such
as<00:03:04.870> like<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.290> scar<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.890> FAL<00:03:06.310> or<00:03:06.850> like<00:03:07.420> the

as like the scar the FAL or like the

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.260 
as like the scar the FAL or like the
accurate<00:03:08.530> weapons<00:03:08.860> such<00:03:09.160> as<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.640> well<00:03:10.150> the

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
accurate weapons such as the well the

SWAT<00:03:10.540> I<00:03:10.780> considered<00:03:11.140> a<00:03:11.230> SWAT<00:03:11.470> a<00:03:11.500> high<00:03:11.710> damage

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
SWAT I considered a SWAT a high damage

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.260 
SWAT I considered a SWAT a high damage
weaponless<00:03:12.580> three<00:03:12.910> round<00:03:13.120> burst<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:14.920> uh<00:03:15.270> they

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
weaponless three round burst it uh they

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.700 
weaponless three round burst it uh they
doesn't<00:03:16.750> seem<00:03:16.990> though<00:03:17.140> it<00:03:17.350> doesn't<00:03:17.500> seem<00:03:17.680> to

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
doesn't seem though it doesn't seem to

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.830 
doesn't seem though it doesn't seem to
affect<00:03:17.890> them<00:03:18.220> as<00:03:18.310> much<00:03:18.430> mainly<00:03:19.360> because<00:03:19.390> their

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
affect them as much mainly because their

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.990 
affect them as much mainly because their
shots<00:03:20.110> are<00:03:20.290> so<00:03:20.410> close<00:03:20.650> together<00:03:20.860> like<00:03:21.670> a<00:03:21.850> and

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
shots are so close together like a and

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.220 
shots are so close together like a and
94<00:03:22.390> you<00:03:22.600> could<00:03:22.720> probably<00:03:22.870> away<00:03:23.080> with

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
94 you could probably away with

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.720 
94 you could probably away with
toughness<00:03:23.440> because<00:03:23.890> of<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.130> fact<00:03:24.310> it<00:03:24.520> shoots

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
toughness because of the fact it shoots

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.640 
toughness because of the fact it shoots
so<00:03:24.880> fast<00:03:25.120> at<00:03:25.330> the<00:03:25.360> very<00:03:25.540> to<00:03:25.720> first<00:03:26.050> two<00:03:26.260> bullets

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
so fast at the very to first two bullets

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.380 
so fast at the very to first two bullets

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
so the first two bullets are going to

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.790 
so the first two bullets are going to
hit<00:03:28.510> regardless<00:03:29.020> in<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.230> third<00:03:29.410> bullet<00:03:29.590> might

hit regardless in the third bullet might

toughness<00:03:31.840> I<00:03:32.200> know<00:03:32.709> sergeant<00:03:33.220> Merrell<00:03:33.459> did<00:03:33.640> a

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
toughness I know sergeant Merrell did a

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.490 
toughness I know sergeant Merrell did a
very<00:03:34.000> good<00:03:34.150> video<00:03:34.570> on<00:03:34.810> toughness<00:03:35.230> and<00:03:35.380> I'm

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
very good video on toughness and I'm

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
very good video on toughness and I'm
actually<00:03:35.620> gonna<00:03:35.830> link<00:03:36.010> that<00:03:36.130> video<00:03:36.250> in<00:03:36.459> the

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
actually gonna link that video in the

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.440 
actually gonna link that video in the
description<00:03:36.580> below<00:03:36.970> if<00:03:37.239> you're<00:03:37.330> actually

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
description below if you're actually

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.660 
description below if you're actually
wondering<00:03:37.930> what<00:03:38.170> toughness<00:03:38.950> does<00:03:39.190> for<00:03:39.430> you<00:03:39.550> as

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
wondering what toughness does for you as

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.880 
wondering what toughness does for you as
a<00:03:39.700> gun<00:03:39.940> class<00:03:40.209> because<00:03:41.050> for<00:03:41.410> a<00:03:41.440> while<00:03:41.620> there<00:03:41.860> I

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
a gun class because for a while there I

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.130 
a gun class because for a while there I
thought<00:03:42.040> toughness<00:03:42.700> was<00:03:42.880> so<00:03:43.180> pivotal<00:03:43.630> to<00:03:43.959> this

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
thought toughness was so pivotal to this

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.020 
thought toughness was so pivotal to this
game<00:03:44.380> that<00:03:44.620> you<00:03:44.770> can<00:03:44.800> play<00:03:44.950> without<00:03:45.280> it<00:03:45.580> and

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
game that you can play without it and

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.120 
game that you can play without it and
anybody<00:03:46.270> that<00:03:46.420> knows<00:03:46.630> me<00:03:46.660> I<00:03:47.080> use<00:03:47.650> scavenger

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
I've also wondered I wonder what like

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.900 
I've also wondered I wonder what like
the<00:04:10.570> silencers<00:04:11.080> going<00:04:11.230> to<00:04:11.290> be<00:04:11.470> like<00:04:12.250> I<00:04:12.519> spent<00:04:12.820> a

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
the silencers going to be like I spent a

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.190 
the silencers going to be like I spent a
while<00:04:13.000> since<00:04:13.209> I<00:04:13.330> got<00:04:13.480> to<00:04:13.570> use<00:04:13.660> the<00:04:13.780> scar<00:04:14.019> rate

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
while since I got to use the scar rate

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.540 
while since I got to use the scar rate
since<00:04:14.410> the<00:04:14.530> scar-h<00:04:14.769> was<00:04:15.010> the<00:04:15.130> very<00:04:15.400> first

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
since the scar-h was the very first

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.240 
since the scar-h was the very first
weapon<00:04:15.970> that<00:04:16.180> actually<00:04:16.330> got<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.230> gold<00:04:17.890> camo

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
weapon that actually got the gold camo

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.550 
weapon that actually got the gold camo
for<00:04:18.609> and<00:04:19.299> I<00:04:19.419> did<00:04:19.810> that<00:04:19.959> because<00:04:20.200> I<00:04:20.290> felt<00:04:20.470> was

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
for and I did that because I felt was

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.460 
for and I did that because I felt was
gonna<00:04:20.739> be<00:04:20.830> the<00:04:20.919> hardest<00:04:21.280> to<00:04:21.459> get<00:04:21.609> so<00:04:22.300> I'm<00:04:23.260> gonna

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
gonna be the hardest to get so I'm gonna

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.810 
gonna be the hardest to get so I'm gonna
go<00:04:23.650> back<00:04:23.830> and<00:04:24.040> try<00:04:24.220> a<00:04:24.250> couple<00:04:24.700> different

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
go back and try a couple different

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.640 
go back and try a couple different
styles<00:04:25.510> probably<00:04:25.750> later<00:04:25.900> tonight<00:04:26.290> with<00:04:26.500> the

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
styles probably later tonight with the

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.070 
styles probably later tonight with the
scar-h<00:04:27.430> maybe<00:04:27.850> like<00:04:28.060> a<00:04:28.090> silencer<00:04:28.600> adjustable

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080

great the silencer into my game like us
has<00:04:33.349> always<00:04:33.560> been<00:04:33.650> a<00:04:33.710> big<00:04:33.889> pivotal<00:04:34.280> part<00:04:34.430> and

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
has always been a big pivotal part and

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.209 
has always been a big pivotal part and

likes it since this black ops 2 came out
I<00:04:37.430> kind<00:04:38.060> of<00:04:38.180> dropped<00:04:38.360> the<00:04:38.509> silencer<00:04:39.020> from<00:04:39.139> my

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
I kind of dropped the silencer from my

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:40.989 
I kind of dropped the silencer from my
repertoire<00:04:39.560> mainly<00:04:40.009> because<00:04:40.129> it<00:04:40.370> was<00:04:40.460> so<00:04:40.699> far

00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:40.999 
repertoire mainly because it was so far

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:43.929 
repertoire mainly because it was so far
down<00:04:41.029> the<00:04:41.330> assault<00:04:41.599> rifle<00:04:42.550> unlock<00:04:43.550> its<00:04:43.759> like

00:04:43.929 --> 00:04:43.939 
down the assault rifle unlock its like

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:48.070 
down the assault rifle unlock its like
the<00:04:44.749> 12th<00:04:45.110> unlock<00:04:45.560> of<00:04:45.770> like<00:04:45.949> 17<00:04:46.669> and<00:04:47.080> sometimes

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
the 12th unlock of like 17 and sometimes

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.749 
the 12th unlock of like 17 and sometimes
just<00:04:48.229> don't<00:04:48.409> get<00:04:48.560> them<00:04:48.710> and<00:04:48.860> once<00:04:49.340> you<00:04:49.460> do<00:04:49.580> get

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 
just don't get them and once you do get

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:51.219 
just don't get them and once you do get
them<00:04:49.879> you<00:04:49.969> kind<00:04:50.090> of<00:04:50.210> forget<00:04:50.360> to<00:04:50.659> using<00:04:51.050> because

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229 
them you kind of forget to using because

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:52.749 
them you kind of forget to using because
you<00:04:51.319> adjust<00:04:51.650> doing<00:04:51.830> a<00:04:51.860> whole<00:04:52.039> new<00:04:52.219> style<00:04:52.460> all

you adjust doing a whole new style all
together<00:04:53.439> but<00:04:54.439> I<00:04:54.710> wondering<00:04:55.699> how<00:04:55.849> much

00:04:56.019 --> 00:04:56.029 
together but I wondering how much

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:57.369 
together but I wondering how much
different<00:04:56.449> the<00:04:56.509> silencer<00:04:56.930> is<00:04:56.990> going<00:04:57.169> to<00:04:57.229> be

00:04:57.369 --> 00:04:57.379 
different the silencer is going to be

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:58.719 
different the silencer is going to be
I've<00:04:57.770> also<00:04:57.949> probably<00:04:58.310> going<00:04:58.490> to<00:04:58.550> start

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
I've also probably going to start

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:00.159 
I've also probably going to start
integrating<00:04:58.879> ghost<00:04:59.360> on<00:04:59.539> some<00:04:59.689> of<00:04:59.810> my<00:04:59.900> classes

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
integrating ghost on some of my classes

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.230 
integrating ghost on some of my classes
especially<00:05:00.439> in<00:05:00.860> hardline<00:05:01.310> I've<00:05:01.849> gotten<00:05:02.120> so

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
especially in hardline I've gotten so
