00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
only one safety deep i basically just

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.779 
only one safety deep i basically just
put<00:00:52.410> both<00:00:52.590> outside<00:00:53.070> wide<00:00:53.250> receivers<00:00:53.670> on

side<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.949> field<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.460> safety<00:00:56.789> plate

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
side of the field that the safety plate

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.209 
side of the field that the safety plate
just<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.809> get<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> big<00:00:58.140> play<00:00:58.379> or<00:00:58.649> even<00:00:59.010> just<00:00:59.039> to

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
just to get a big play or even just to

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.799 
just to get a big play or even just to
keep<00:00:59.370> them<00:00:59.520> honest<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.059> make<00:01:00.210> them<00:01:00.359> second

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
keep them honest and make them second

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.319 
keep them honest and make them second
guess<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:02.160> best<00:01:02.340> thing<00:01:02.460> about<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:02.879> run

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
guess the best thing about this run

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.479 
guess the best thing about this run
though<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.650> easy<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.250> have

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
though is that it's so easy to have

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.060 
though is that it's so easy to have
success<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.720> play<00:01:06.930> develops<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.560> such<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.799> way

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
success the play develops in such a way

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.280 
success the play develops in such a way
that<00:01:08.100> makes<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.640> easy<00:01:08.880> for<00:01:09.000> literally<00:01:09.600> anyone

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
that makes it easy for literally anyone

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.800 
that makes it easy for literally anyone
to<00:01:11.100> read<00:01:11.340> whether<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.150> should<00:01:12.210> take<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.600> off

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
to read whether you should take it off

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.440 
to read whether you should take it off
tackle<00:01:13.110> or<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.340> outside<00:01:14.729> either<00:01:15.060> way

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
tackle or to the outside either way

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.300 
tackle or to the outside either way
we're<00:01:15.869> going<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.049> pick<00:01:16.200> up<00:01:16.320> huge<00:01:16.710> yards

another thing I'd like to add about this
formation<00:03:57.750> is<00:03:58.080> that<00:03:58.110> I<00:03:58.290> played<00:03:58.620> a<00:03:58.650> lot<00:03:58.890> of

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
formation is that I played a lot of

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.010 
formation is that I played a lot of
ranked<00:03:59.370> games<00:03:59.640> which<00:04:00.060> is<00:04:00.180> on<00:04:00.330> that<00:04:00.480> all-pro

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
ranked games which is on that all-pro

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.530 
ranked games which is on that all-pro
garbage<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:01.709> that<00:04:02.310> just<00:04:02.520> gives<00:04:02.730> bad<00:04:03.120> players

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
garbage and that just gives bad players

tip<00:06:11.159> for<00:06:11.339> the<00:06:11.399> MATLAB<00:06:11.789> or<00:06:11.819> whatever<00:06:12.179> and<00:06:12.439> I

00:06:13.429 --> 00:06:13.439 
tip for the MATLAB or whatever and I

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:14.929 
tip for the MATLAB or whatever and I
definitely<00:06:13.740> throw<00:06:14.129> this<00:06:14.279> formation<00:06:14.610> in<00:06:14.849> a

00:06:14.929 --> 00:06:14.939 
definitely throw this formation in a

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:16.909 
definitely throw this formation in a
couple<00:06:15.209> times<00:06:15.330> here<00:06:15.599> and<00:06:15.689> there<00:06:15.919> now

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
couple times here and there now

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:18.889 
couple times here and there now
obviously<00:06:17.490> tight<00:06:17.849> ends<00:06:18.180> on<00:06:18.269> corner<00:06:18.719> routes

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:18.899 
obviously tight ends on corner routes

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:21.079 
obviously tight ends on corner routes
have<00:06:19.080> been<00:06:19.139> effective<00:06:19.769> for<00:06:19.800> ever<00:06:20.249> in<00:06:20.519> men<00:06:20.699> so

00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:21.089 
have been effective for ever in men so

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:23.480 
have been effective for ever in men so
because<00:06:21.809> of<00:06:22.019> that<00:06:22.139> I<00:06:22.439> also<00:06:22.800> like<00:06:23.099> to<00:06:23.129> throw<00:06:23.399> in

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
because of that I also like to throw in

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.509 
because of that I also like to throw in
the<00:06:23.669> play<00:06:23.849> PA<00:06:24.240> bucks<00:06:24.659> white<00:06:24.899> corner<00:06:25.319> the<00:06:26.219> setup

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:26.519 
the play PA bucks white corner the setup

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:28.009 
the play PA bucks white corner the setup
for<00:06:26.699> this<00:06:26.819> is<00:06:27.119> generally<00:06:27.599> going<00:06:27.689> to<00:06:27.809> be<00:06:27.899> the

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:28.019 
for this is generally going to be the

00:06:28.019 --> 00:06:30.079 
for this is generally going to be the
same<00:06:28.229> every<00:06:28.709> time<00:06:28.740> except<00:06:29.639> once<00:06:29.789> in<00:06:29.879> a<00:06:29.939> while

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:30.089 
same every time except once in a while

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:31.189 
same every time except once in a while
we're<00:06:30.240> going<00:06:30.269> to<00:06:30.419> put<00:06:30.539> a<00:06:30.599> tight<00:06:30.869> end<00:06:31.050> in<00:06:31.169> the

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 
we're going to put a tight end in the

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:34.129 
we're going to put a tight end in the
streak<00:06:31.610> now<00:06:32.610> against<00:06:32.909> man<00:06:33.300> coverage<00:06:33.629> either

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139 
streak now against man coverage either

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:36.290 
streak now against man coverage either
tight<00:06:34.619> end<00:06:34.800> is<00:06:34.919> obviously<00:06:35.339> a<00:06:35.430> nice<00:06:35.639> target<00:06:35.969> and

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 
tight end is obviously a nice target and

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.689 
tight end is obviously a nice target and
the<00:06:36.869> crossing<00:06:37.349> road<00:06:37.499> is<00:06:37.740> a<00:06:37.769> third<00:06:38.189> option<00:06:38.369> to

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699 
the crossing road is a third option to

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:41.029 
the crossing road is a third option to
me<00:06:38.819> man<00:06:39.059> plus<00:06:39.389> all<00:06:39.689> three<00:06:40.559> of<00:06:40.589> those<00:06:40.740> roads

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 
me man plus all three of those roads

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:42.949 
me man plus all three of those roads
actually<00:06:41.519> do<00:06:41.639> a<00:06:41.669> pretty<00:06:41.939> decent<00:06:42.209> job<00:06:42.509> again

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:42.959 
actually do a pretty decent job again

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:45.379 
actually do a pretty decent job again
zone<00:06:43.199> coverage<00:06:43.619> now<00:06:44.490> the<00:06:44.550> B<00:06:44.729> receiver<00:06:45.149> as<00:06:45.269> you

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:45.389 
zone coverage now the B receiver as you

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:46.999 
zone coverage now the B receiver as you
can<00:06:45.509> see<00:06:45.629> right<00:06:45.659> here<00:06:46.050> I<00:06:46.289> like<00:06:46.529> to<00:06:46.649> put<00:06:46.800> on<00:06:46.919> a

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:47.009 
can see right here I like to put on a

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:49.249 
can see right here I like to put on a
smokescreen<00:06:47.490> for<00:06:48.329> when<00:06:48.449> the<00:06:48.599> zone<00:06:48.809> coverage

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:49.259 
smokescreen for when the zone coverage

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:51.409 
smokescreen for when the zone coverage
plays<00:06:49.499> off<00:06:49.829> the<00:06:49.860> wide<00:06:50.249> receiver<00:06:50.729> leaving<00:06:51.329> them

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:51.419 
plays off the wide receiver leaving them

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:53.719 
plays off the wide receiver leaving them
wide<00:06:51.659> open<00:06:52.079> now<00:06:52.860> it's<00:06:52.979> important<00:06:53.399> to<00:06:53.459> note

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:53.729 
wide open now it's important to note

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:55.459 
wide open now it's important to note
that<00:06:53.759> once<00:06:54.269> the<00:06:54.449> receiver<00:06:54.749> catches<00:06:55.199> the<00:06:55.289> bowl

00:06:55.459 --> 00:06:55.469 
that once the receiver catches the bowl

00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:57.859 
that once the receiver catches the bowl
I<00:06:55.680> like<00:06:55.979> to<00:06:56.099> let<00:06:56.249> the<00:06:56.399> CPU<00:06:57.089> move<00:06:57.300> up<00:06:57.449> the<00:06:57.569> field

00:06:57.859 --> 00:06:57.869 
I like to let the CPU move up the field

00:06:57.869 --> 00:06:59.689 
I like to let the CPU move up the field
on<00:06:58.050> that<00:06:58.680> smokescreen<00:06:59.159> you're<00:06:59.399> going<00:06:59.519> to<00:06:59.579> get

00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699 
on that smokescreen you're going to get

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:02.149 
on that smokescreen you're going to get
a<00:06:59.729> lot<00:07:00.029> more<00:07:00.059> yards<00:07:00.599> that<00:07:00.749> way<00:07:00.919> now<00:07:01.919> if<00:07:02.039> the

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:02.159 
a lot more yards that way now if the

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:03.949 
a lot more yards that way now if the
Soudan<00:07:02.550> defender<00:07:02.939> place<00:07:03.180> close<00:07:03.539> to<00:07:03.569> the<00:07:03.839> wide

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:03.959 
Soudan defender place close to the wide

00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:05.749 
Soudan defender place close to the wide
receiver<00:07:04.439> it's<00:07:04.949> going<00:07:05.129> to<00:07:05.189> leave<00:07:05.339> some<00:07:05.519> nice

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 
receiver it's going to leave some nice

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.639 
receiver it's going to leave some nice
room<00:07:06.089> for<00:07:06.119> the<00:07:06.389> tight<00:07:06.599> end<00:07:06.809> to<00:07:06.930> get<00:07:07.050> open<00:07:07.289> on

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:07.649 
room for the tight end to get open on

00:07:07.649 --> 00:07:10.040 
room for the tight end to get open on
the<00:07:07.740> sideline<00:07:08.159> and<00:07:08.599> we're<00:07:09.599> going<00:07:09.719> to<00:07:09.749> have<00:07:09.899> the

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.050 
the sideline and we're going to have the

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.290 
the sideline and we're going to have the
third<00:07:10.319> option<00:07:10.589> of<00:07:11.039> the<00:07:11.309> crossing<00:07:11.550> road

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:14.300

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:16.610 
and finally the halfbacks lamb is

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.820 
and finally the halfbacks lamb is
actually<00:07:17.210> a<00:07:17.240> pretty<00:07:17.599> nice<00:07:17.840> run<00:07:18.259> play<00:07:18.530> as<00:07:18.680> well

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:18.830

actually a pretty nice run play as well
i<00:07:19.190> like<00:07:19.759> to<00:07:19.909> use<00:07:19.940> it<00:07:20.150> against<00:07:20.360> three-man

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:20.840 
i like to use it against three-man

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.559 
i like to use it against three-man
fronts<00:07:21.229> and<00:07:21.379> if<00:07:22.009> you<00:07:22.129> look<00:07:22.370> close<00:07:22.669> just<00:07:23.419> take<00:07:23.539> a

00:07:23.559 --> 00:07:23.569 
fronts and if you look close just take a

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:25.629 
fronts and if you look close just take a
look<00:07:23.659> at<00:07:23.870> how<00:07:23.960> the<00:07:24.020> offensive<00:07:24.560> line<00:07:24.740> loves<00:07:25.340> to

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:25.639 
look at how the offensive line loves to

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:28.360 
look at how the offensive line loves to
attack<00:07:25.970> defenders<00:07:26.479> of<00:07:26.599> the<00:07:26.750> middle<00:07:27.020> also<00:07:27.919> to

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:28.370 
attack defenders of the middle also to
