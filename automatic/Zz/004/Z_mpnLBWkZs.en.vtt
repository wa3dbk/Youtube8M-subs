00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
well you know that's a great question

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.679 
well you know that's a great question
and<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:25.500> true<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.100> basic<00:01:26.490> recipe<00:01:26.670> does<00:01:27.299> use

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
and it's true the basic recipe does use

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.800 
and it's true the basic recipe does use
tomatoes<00:01:28.380> as<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> key<00:01:29.070> ingredient<00:01:29.509> but<00:01:30.509> we<00:01:30.659> have

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
tomatoes as a key ingredient but we have

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.020

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
to provide fluid and/or moisture so I

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.499

picked Tomatoes because it's so easy you
know<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:39.960> easy<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.290> get<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> package<00:01:41.009> of

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
know it's so easy to get a package of

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.030

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
base and it helps so we can make the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.450 
base and it helps so we can make the
meal<00:01:48.509> without<00:01:48.930> having<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.439> add<00:01:49.560> oil<00:01:49.979> or

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
tomatoes have been a key part but we

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.770 
tomatoes have been a key part but we

just<00:02:29.700> plain<00:02:30.060> water<00:02:30.360> works<00:02:30.810> because<00:02:31.710> while

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
just plain water works because while

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.270 
just plain water works because while
you're<00:02:32.550> cooking<00:02:32.850> up<00:02:33.210> the<00:02:33.870> meal<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:35.040> water

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
you're cooking up the meal the water

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.580 
you're cooking up the meal the water
absorbs<00:02:35.910> many<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.480> flavors<00:02:36.990> and<00:02:37.290> you'll

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
absorbs many of the flavors and you'll

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.800 
absorbs many of the flavors and you'll
actually<00:02:37.800> begin<00:02:38.460> to<00:02:38.610> form<00:02:38.880> a<00:02:39.030> little<00:02:39.270> base<00:02:39.510> or

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
actually begin to form a little base or

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.110 
actually begin to form a little base or
a<00:02:39.840> broth<00:02:40.170> in<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.950> preparation<00:02:41.610> of<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.880> meal

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
a broth in the preparation of the meal

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.110 
a broth in the preparation of the meal
so<00:02:42.900> if<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:43.290> just<00:02:43.560> substitute<00:02:44.070> water<00:02:44.700> for<00:02:45.030> the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
so if you just substitute water for the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.210 
so if you just substitute water for the
tomatoes<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:45.780> prepare<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.320> meal<00:02:46.500> you'll

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
tomatoes and prepare the meal you'll

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.860 
tomatoes and prepare the meal you'll
find<00:02:47.550> that<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:47.880> actually<00:02:48.210> comes<00:02:48.420> out<00:02:48.600> pretty

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
find that it actually comes out pretty

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.010
