00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:10.650 
see when you should stop mixing it to

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.650 
see when you should stop mixing it to
see<00:02:10.860> when<00:02:11.100> it's<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.400> best<00:02:11.630> consistency<00:02:12.630> like

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
see when it's the best consistency like

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.540 
see when it's the best consistency like
the<00:02:13.050> same<00:02:13.320> consistency<00:02:14.100> of<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:16.370> normal<00:02:17.370> sugar

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
the same consistency of the normal sugar

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.490 
the same consistency of the normal sugar
scrub<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.840> buy<00:02:19.020> this<00:02:19.590> was<00:02:21.350> so<00:02:22.350> I<00:02:22.380> think
