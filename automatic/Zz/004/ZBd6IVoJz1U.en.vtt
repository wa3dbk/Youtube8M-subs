00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.680
 the arranged one trusts and I hope that 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.730
 you're fine my coach needs to 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.050
 finds for a new rom on the 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.279
 Larvae chain in florian thomas 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.259
 version one form the middle left 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.550
 French Olympic marseille who 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.259
 has a second team from the 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.730
 week from wednesday to wednesday 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.440
 next as usual it lasts 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.910
 for a week you have his stats 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.750
 ideas put forward in parades I 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.610
 invite you to pause 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.140
 to be able to point out to the 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.219
 level of the team a team me france 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.290
 me first league 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.300
 again to note that I have not 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.660
 hesitated to make changes in full 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.550
 match 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.899
 I was going out ben arfa who did not have 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.839
 necessarily the collective to do 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.579
 go back marco royce and I changed 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:53.420
 thauvin I put it right side because 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.629
 that's really where I find 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.710
 better by the way it's one of the games 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.480
 is not developed negative but I 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.429
 let's talk about it now I find 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.980
 pity the fact that the torrent is 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:05.420
 left side and not right so good a 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.110
 left-handed left to center it's 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.640
 really practical 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.860
 but I would have preferred a little right-handed 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.990
 side a small hook right side rather 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.860
 to precisely go in and hit because 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.300
 that he has a left foot really 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.630
 interesting after that's true that against 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.870
 nantes 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.159
 he played on the left so obviously it's 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.360
 logical that they be boost this side 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.219
 so we'll start by talking about 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.329
 prize game florian thauvin in version one 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:24.740
 so its price is around 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.750
 20 miles credit when I get you 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.680
 make the rose where they may fall 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.119
 in the coming days 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.500
 obviously it's okay I think it's okay 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.750
 some swing gradually opened 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.130
 with money sports oms advanced 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.409
 some little rugs to see in the 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.820
 weekend or even after so risk of there 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.710
 still have a lot on live and 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.850
 its price will drop in the weekend 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.979
 so if you want to wait a little 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.149
 beating memories honestly this 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.859
 price there it's really not stolen because 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.909
 that I found them really very very 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:48.289
 right to talk about the points 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.729
 negatives now from thauvin florian 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.100
 so already at the level of the negative points 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.270
 the set pieces they have a thousand 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.250
 stats in a free kick simply 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.899
 disgusting 56 years hit accuracy 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.250
 Frank it's just horrible 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.170
 there are no other words I have 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.579
 tested two or three with his share 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.960
 really no matter how already I 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.630
 draws them badly then with a player that 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.789
 a disgusting stat should not try 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.619
 the r ropes I pulled a few years 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.970
 it's the same it's not really that 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.930
 all the corner they have really strong at 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.250
 level set pieces so 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.870
 it's really not about him that will 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.700
 count to kick kicks 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.040
 arrested and the penaltys 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.540
 I had two teeth review 58 years 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.709
 at the penalty and I put both so 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.780
 it's for when we show that 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.819
 it's still pretty random 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.319
 penaltys and then the other points 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.540
 negatives still more important that 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.250
 stats in strength 66 in strength and 73 in 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.959
 balance I find that they are done 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.870
 to move really very, very much 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.340
 easily in some situations that 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.930
 still pose a lot of problems 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.970
 especially that down the matches where I have that 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.470
 I played with the top 20 I'm often 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.120
 fell against defenders rather 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.980
 physical I fell a lot of times 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.840
 against company and shoulder it was 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.010
 really the crisis after happily 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.330
 that they compensate in particular with the 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.400
 speed there for example I 'm talking to you I 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.170
 at last he does not hold on his legs 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.329
 there strangely there is on his legs that 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.760
 remains random but it is done when 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:01.280
 even move pretty easily and its 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.930
 problematic and after the three 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.450
 bad foot star he has a right foot 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.730
 really mean even though I scored 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.340
 goals right foot with a right foot 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.269
 rather blah it must be specified so 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.769
 now at the level of the positives 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.660
 to drill slowly because after 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.280
 has so much already at the level of 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.650
 speed 84 years speed on the map 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.910
 it's really very correct 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.490
 correct for a winger there are and 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.950
 the ibook faster is true but 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.830
 in the device in which I play 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.960
 it really is really enough 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.600
 the speed he has after technically 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.530
 very impressive 84 in dribbling m 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.360
 with its four stars gestures 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.100
 techniques technically I got 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.210
 feast so be it small 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.160
 casters I have not done very much 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.180
 technique of madness but in execution 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.500
 dribbling honestly it's 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.510
 really very quickly and that's 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.820
 still a big positive con after the 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.380
 finish 77 in finish it's true he 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.030
 are much better players in term 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.230
 finishing but do not forget the 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.740
 guy we're talking about a player that 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.150
 only 79 2 general and his 70th in 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.340
 finish obviously feels in 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.080
 some situations he'll miss he'll 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.790
 miss nine years he will miss the frame have 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.060
 when you expect that that puts 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.460
 basically 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.680
 but here it helps anyway correct 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.410
 for a kind 4.79 of general 1.67 in 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.760
 finish is good 76th shot you 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.110
 you can see on the last clip 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.840
 that far-off strikes is talking 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.549
 really good with him a quality 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.989
 really very interesting password 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.430
 seventy-eight years because it is 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.420
 centers passes lobed passes 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.100
 in depth etc 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.570
 he is really at the rendezvous I 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.060
 first did a lot of beautiful beautiful 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.740
 openings you could see for marco 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.450
 reus I think it's also marco 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.160
 reus who put the most goals through 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.360
 all wind because I did a lot of 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.520
 to pass here so here it is already the last 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.170
 clip a missile in the skylight in the 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.120
 decree skylight yielded rey to 6 end 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:41.600
 for for the little information that 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.070
 was crucified after 79 in vision 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.240
 positioning game I put them in 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.860
 the positives but it's true that 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.600
 I found he had a little bit 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.220
 too much tendency to transplant in the 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.560
 so that that can be a problem a 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.960
 negative point for those who do not like 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.790
 to have adults that transplant in the ax 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.520
 he is enormously in lax it is he is 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:01.180
 very often in lax and do not hesitate 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.160
 not to use the 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.539
 how to say the wing change for 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.160
 that they end up right or even 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:07.780
 make the small change that I made 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.009
 in full match because right side he 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.410
 is still a lot more interesting 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.580
 that on the left side which you have the 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.780
 balance diouf loriot thomas who is 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.180
 displayed before your eyes so at the level 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.610
 positive points vision agility the 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.560
 speed 84 years speed more than correct 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.330
 for a winger finish it's really 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.289
 good in finish in front of the cages even if 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.850
 obviously there are some small 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.710
 imprecision dribbles very comfortable 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.030
 technically longshot control 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.500
 positioning it is very easy to 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.580
 find even though from time to time as 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.169
 I said in the axique 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.300
 its pass quality that is really 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.550
 very very good typing power 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.380
 voices on the last clip that bah he 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.789
 still a good good paw 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.190
 left and so in the negative points 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:43.449
 kicks stopped balance strength 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.949
 three stars bad foot it's mostly 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:47.080
 strength and balanced two points 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:48.460
 most problematic negatives with the 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.960
 florian thomas and so you see the 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.270
 record with seven matches 10 goals 5 assists 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.949
 decisive a very very good balance sheet for a 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.240
 day you what it costs not really 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:57.009
 dear so that's all for the review 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.840
 florian thauvin version it does form 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:05:59.949
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.419
 this video carpet does not hesitate to put 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:02.680

 Sunday no fat the adventurer but the 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.729
