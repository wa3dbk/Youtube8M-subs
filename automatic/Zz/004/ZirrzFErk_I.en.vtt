00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.490
 the resistance of freelander to 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.500
 evoke's sportsmanship was born 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.270
 the land rover discovery sport was 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.190
 presented in the last issue 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.960
 but more than replacing 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.150
 another utility of the brand has 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.520
 own personality bringing items 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.100
 how good a good finish 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.500
 internal fitness off-road and 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.500
 especially great comfort 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.219
 the modern west aspect has been made clear 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.890
 when we look at the design of details 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.890
 front and rear lights 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:08.730
 in addition 20-inch wheels line 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:12.020
 continuous waist and panoramic roof 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.020
 are your differentials 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:27.200
 the engine or even evoke by turbo and 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.200
 direct injection of fuel 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:55.360
 It's interesting the drive of that car is 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.220
 that it emerged as something different in the 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.310
 line you look and talk because he is well 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:05.050
 similar to evoke without a doubt the most 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.479
 remembering that I'm going to solve it and 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.709
 discover the sport a land rover has 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:14.470
 a difference of finish and such however 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.810
 I noticed that the Land Rover it 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.000
 I did not finish this car 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.450
 only in the project also in finishing it 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.550
 there are things that there is the idea of ​​land rover 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:29.220
 the brand is just make this one 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:35.530
 best- selling utility, right? 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:39.239
 There are three versions of this hs and car 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.239
 that he went 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:49.290
 performance is also something here 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.470
 this car has to spare is not the idea 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.360
 it's not being a sportive but in this respect 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:00.920
 he also does very well with the set 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:03.239
 Mechanical same mechanical assembly 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.610
 evoke what I find interesting from 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:09.299
 cigarette that surprised me a lot 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.340
 besides the style is it looks like it 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.989
 I'll start you start to look being in the 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.010
 local traffic being sold for three 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.209
 months are still few in the street so you 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.190
 walking the car on the street and only for one 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.769
 the traffic light was looking here during the 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.769
 Recording also personnel repairing 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.079
 Pretty much at first you think I 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:31.170
 I will keep a good waist line 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:34.459
 and this difference is one of the 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.459
 has predicted that 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.160
 in terms of finishing there that among the 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.740
 differential the idea of ​​this car I spoke 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.930
 there at the head of video comfort is 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.940
 comfort the keyword of land rover 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.700
 to develop this car 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.770
 It takes five passengers that you can 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.690
 place a further row of seats with 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:04.050
 Three banks are left behind because the 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.610
 ceiling is also high in terms of 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.640
 finishing 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.320
 the finishing is a legal point of this 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.710
 car 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:17.250
 we have there as much as she remembers 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:20.270
 and I also come back here at the panel 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:23.580
 typical side the land rovers central screen 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:26.720
 console to this transmission that they 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.550
 have innovated since they are two years 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.430
 the very functional three-spoke steering wheel 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.800
 seams that the finish is very cool 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.380
 I was positively surprised already 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.200
 imagining of course that it was a model of 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.670
 Brand and something else I liked 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.310
 enough 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.710
 it was precisely the audio system already 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.550
 I said that I like listening to music. 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:53.760
 orchestrated classical music and 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:57.270
 Audio of the meridian are 17 speakers 17 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:00.750
 loudspeakers and other features 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:03.120
 sound and really fantastic only you 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.110
 you can hear treble bass all that 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.110
 Do you want it in here? 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:26.989
 the same behavior when I go 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:30.679
 creating is has independent suspension has 

00:05:26.989 --> 00:05:32.149
 The terrain is responsible for the ways 

00:05:30.679 --> 00:05:34.489
 off road, right? 

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:36.259
 land rover does not face anything is 

00:05:34.489 --> 00:05:38.749
 this main characteristic 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:41.269
 but the nine-speed mechanical assembly is the 

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:45.469
 nine-speed transition with good 

00:05:41.269 --> 00:05:47.659
 smooth and in general it is a car 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:50.629
 interesting because he hands you 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:54.169
 precisely the land rover proposal that 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:58.129
 is comfort is a very comfortable car 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:59.659
 too comfortable are not you to do so much 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:01.669
 have walked so much everyday because it is a 

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:04.039
 car that is not too big and at the same time 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:06.559
 time for you to travel and such 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:07.909
 nine marches have sport option can 

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:11.959
 use the butterflies 

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:15.259
 but honestly in this car here 

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:19.459
 I switched on the audio taking advantage of the audio 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:23.989
 meridia classic songs aquino 32 eu 

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:25.009
 I heard and leaving automatic exchanges well 

00:06:23.989 --> 00:06:28.490
 soft 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:30.979
 It's a car to enjoy the ride and if it is 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:33.319
 I must also put on a trail for 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:35.479
 that this is not the true vocation is 

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:38.149
 best original purpose of saying 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:41.569
 land rover models and the network were 

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:44.119
 also moments asking you to see yourself in the 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:47.149
 next subject directing cool stuff 

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:50.439
 comfortable classic at last solve 

00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:50.439
 here in the garage is more
