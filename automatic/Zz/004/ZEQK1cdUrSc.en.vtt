tend to walk into the single on not
quite<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.230> loose<00:00:25.500> on<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.830> ceiling<00:00:26.250> though<00:00:27.260> one

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
quite so loose on the ceiling though one

quite so loose on the ceiling though one
ball<00:00:28.529> will<00:00:28.800> me<00:00:28.980> work<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.929> think<00:00:30.929> it's<00:00:31.230> one<00:00:31.410> of

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
ball will me work I think it's one of

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.290 
ball will me work I think it's one of
the<00:00:31.619> like<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.040> bad<00:00:32.309> connection<00:00:32.669> or<00:00:32.969> something

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
the like a bad connection or something

I'm the new and putting fix in the

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.040 
I'm the new and putting fix in the
electrical<00:01:00.829> connections<00:01:01.870> because<00:01:02.870> this

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
electrical connections because this

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.219 
electrical connections because this
thing<00:01:03.289> had<00:01:03.530> I<00:01:04.000> what<00:01:05.000> I<00:01:05.030> wired<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:05.720> signal

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
thing had I what I wired the signal

thing had I what I wired the signal
really<00:01:06.740> didn't<00:01:07.070> know<00:01:07.130> how<00:01:07.280> to<00:01:07.340> solder<00:01:07.610> them

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
really didn't know how to solder them

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.609 
really didn't know how to solder them
the<00:01:09.799> aluminum<00:01:10.250> ends<00:01:10.520> on<00:01:11.200> there's<00:01:12.200> kind<00:01:12.530> of

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
the aluminum ends on there's kind of

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:13.930 
the aluminum ends on there's kind of
like<00:01:12.680> a<00:01:12.830> special<00:01:13.070> with<00:01:13.399> you<00:01:13.460> got<00:01:13.610> a<00:01:13.640> thought<00:01:13.909> on

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
like a special with you got a thought on

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.480 
like a special with you got a thought on
the<00:01:14.299> other<00:01:14.479> you<00:01:15.229> can't<00:01:15.500> get<00:01:15.680> them<00:01:15.799> too<00:01:15.950> hot<00:01:16.190> or

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
the other you can't get them too hot or

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.570 
the other you can't get them too hot or
you<00:01:16.610> gotta<00:01:17.470> just<00:01:18.470> really<00:01:18.770> get<00:01:18.950> hot<00:01:19.190> the<00:01:19.340> solder

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
you gotta just really get hot the solder

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.929 
you gotta just really get hot the solder
them<00:01:20.770> but<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:21.890> problem<00:01:22.250> I<00:01:22.310> was<00:01:22.430> running<00:01:22.820> into

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
them but the problem I was running into

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
is I didn't have the right connector for

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.270 
is I didn't have the right connector for
in<00:01:25.159> there<00:01:25.369> he's<00:01:26.240> like<00:01:26.360> I<00:01:26.619> got<00:01:27.619> this<00:01:27.740> engine<00:01:28.130> as

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
in there he's like I got this engine as

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.240 
in there he's like I got this engine as
a<00:01:28.310> donor<00:01:28.610> engine<00:01:29.440> from<00:01:30.440> someone<00:01:30.860> else<00:01:31.009> I

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
a donor engine from someone else I

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.490 
a donor engine from someone else I
worked<00:01:31.490> at<00:01:31.670> a<00:01:31.789> deal<00:01:32.000> that<00:01:32.720> I<00:01:32.750> put<00:01:33.140> a<00:01:33.170> new<00:01:33.319> engine

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
worked at a deal that I put a new engine

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.870 
worked at a deal that I put a new engine
on<00:01:33.740> there<00:01:33.950> John<00:01:34.250> Deere<00:01:34.580> at<00:01:35.509> our<00:01:35.899> 70<00:01:36.619> or<00:01:36.800> 92<00:01:37.580> and

fuel tank the fuel tank bracket for this

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.850 
fuel tank the fuel tank bracket for this
one<00:01:45.020> is<00:01:45.709> I'd<00:01:46.250> need<00:01:46.520> retailed<00:01:47.060> in<00:01:47.209> there

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
one is I'd need retailed in there

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:55.750 
one is I'd need retailed in there
something

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.790 

so<00:01:58.520> um<00:01:59.660> right<00:02:00.660> now<00:02:00.720> I'm<00:02:00.960> just<00:02:01.140> fixing<00:02:01.560> up<00:02:01.680> the

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
so um right now I'm just fixing up the

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.160 
so um right now I'm just fixing up the
wires<00:02:02.010> sleep<00:02:02.640> instead<00:02:03.510> of<00:02:03.630> having<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.960> big

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
wires sleep instead of having a big

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.870 
wires sleep instead of having a big
extra<00:02:04.500> wire<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:04.980> runs<00:02:05.040> all<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.460> way<00:02:05.610> over

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
extra wire that runs all the way over

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.950 
extra wire that runs all the way over
there<00:02:06.060> I'm<00:02:06.210> just<00:02:06.330> gonna<00:02:06.510> I<00:02:06.900> saw<00:02:07.650> I<00:02:07.680> started<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
there I'm just gonna I saw I started the

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.830 
there I'm just gonna I saw I started the
sing<00:02:09.960> for<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.740> fuse<00:02:11.040> up<00:02:11.490> so<00:02:11.820> it's<00:02:12.540> even

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
sing for the fuse up so it's even

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.590 
sing for the fuse up so it's even
shorter<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:13.730> don't<00:02:14.730> have<00:02:14.880> as<00:02:15.060> many<00:02:15.210> extra

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
shorter and don't have as many extra

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.970 
shorter and don't have as many extra
wires<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.850> I've<00:02:17.850> took<00:02:18.260> almost<00:02:19.260> two<00:02:19.650> feet<00:02:19.860> of

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
wires and I've took almost two feet of

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.200 
wires and I've took almost two feet of
extra<00:02:20.310> wire<00:02:20.490> rid<00:02:20.820> of<00:02:20.910> it

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
extra wire rid of it

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.580 
extra wire rid of it
that<00:02:21.600> was<00:02:21.750> this<00:02:21.900> kind<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:23.030> accumulated<00:02:24.030> I

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
that was this kind of accumulated I

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.960 
that was this kind of accumulated I
think<00:02:25.590> it's<00:02:25.709> nice<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.130> thick<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.430> wires<00:02:26.610> neat

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
think it's nice and thick the wires neat

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.930
