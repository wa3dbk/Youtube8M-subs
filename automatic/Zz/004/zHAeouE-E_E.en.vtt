a distortion module a tiny single knob
in<00:00:20.480> line<00:00:20.690> distortion<00:00:21.260> it's<00:00:21.860> got<00:00:21.980> a<00:00:22.010> real

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
in line distortion it's got a real

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
natural and fat distortion sound and you

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.630 
natural and fat distortion sound and you
can<00:00:24.260> really<00:00:24.470> unlock<00:00:24.770> it<00:00:24.980> by<00:00:25.070> using<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:25.400> hugger

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
can really unlock it by using the hugger

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.490 
can really unlock it by using the hugger
we've<00:00:26.420> got<00:00:26.539> some<00:00:26.660> one<00:00:26.779> of<00:00:26.810> these<00:00:26.990> modules<00:00:27.199> on

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
we've got some one of these modules on

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.170 
we've got some one of these modules on
the<00:00:27.560> way<00:00:27.710> and<00:00:28.369> the<00:00:28.520> cool<00:00:28.670> thing<00:00:28.699> about<00:00:28.850> them<00:00:29.119> is

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 
the way and the cool thing about them is

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.580 
the way and the cool thing about them is
you<00:00:29.240> can<00:00:29.600> stack<00:00:30.020> them<00:00:30.109> on<00:00:30.170> the<00:00:30.260> loop<00:00:30.410> of<00:00:30.529> the

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
you can stack them on the loop of the

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.740 
you can stack them on the loop of the
hugger<00:00:30.740> in<00:00:31.279> any<00:00:31.490> order<00:00:31.789> and<00:00:31.910> basically<00:00:32.390> create

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
hugger in any order and basically create

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.259 
hugger in any order and basically create
your<00:00:32.809> own<00:00:32.899> effect<00:00:33.500> inside<00:00:33.979> the<00:00:34.129> loop<00:00:34.280> turn<00:00:35.120> it

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:35.269 
your own effect inside the loop turn it

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:37.719 
your own effect inside the loop turn it
on/off<00:00:35.469> overdrive<00:00:36.469> inputs<00:00:36.829> outputs<00:00:37.039> using

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:37.729 
on/off overdrive inputs outputs using

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:39.700 
on/off overdrive inputs outputs using
the<00:00:37.789> hugger<00:00:38.170> you<00:00:39.170> can<00:00:39.289> change<00:00:39.409> the<00:00:39.589> order

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
the hugger you can change the order

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.989 
the hugger you can change the order
around<00:00:40.010> inside<00:00:40.309> the<00:00:40.429> loop<00:00:40.579> for<00:00:40.729> different

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:40.999 
around inside the loop for different

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:42.969 
around inside the loop for different
textures<00:00:41.420> and<00:00:41.749> the<00:00:41.780> modules<00:00:42.649> aren't<00:00:42.889> as

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:42.979 
textures and the modules aren't as

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:45.579 
textures and the modules aren't as
expensive<00:00:43.399> as<00:00:43.729> full-size<00:00:44.300> effects<00:00:44.659> so<00:00:44.960> you

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:45.589 
expensive as full-size effects so you

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:46.750 
expensive as full-size effects so you
really<00:00:45.800> have<00:00:45.889> a<00:00:45.920> lot<00:00:46.010> of<00:00:46.069> fun<00:00:46.249> with<00:00:46.370> them<00:00:46.519> we're

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
really have a lot of fun with them we're

00:00:46.760 --> 00:01:36.860 
really have a lot of fun with them we're
excited<00:00:46.969> about<00:00:47.299> it<00:00:47.510> check<00:00:48.139> the<00:00:48.229> video<00:00:48.409> app

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.770 

hey

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.340 

maybe

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:57.920
