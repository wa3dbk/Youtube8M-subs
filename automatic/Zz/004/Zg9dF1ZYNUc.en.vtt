completely<00:00:13.259> dead<00:00:13.880> first<00:00:14.880> thing<00:00:15.089> I<00:00:15.179> did<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.540> I

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
completely dead first thing I did is I

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.330 
completely dead first thing I did is I
checked<00:00:15.960> my<00:00:16.139> power<00:00:16.379> supply<00:00:16.680> voltages<00:00:17.160> I

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
checked my power supply voltages I

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.700 
checked my power supply voltages I
checked<00:00:17.580> my<00:00:17.760> VA<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:19.020> was<00:00:19.199> normal

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
checked my VA it was normal

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.390 
checked my VA it was normal
57<00:00:20.430> volts<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.760> checked<00:00:21.000> my<00:00:21.150> BS<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.750> was<00:00:21.869> normal<00:00:22.199> I

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
57 volts I checked my BS it was normal I

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.439 
57 volts I checked my BS it was normal I
couldn't<00:00:23.400> find<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:24.260> VSC<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:26.300> fortunately<00:00:27.300> my

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
couldn't find the VSC and fortunately my

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.419 
couldn't find the VSC and fortunately my
friend<00:00:27.750> Dan<00:00:27.990> who's<00:00:28.470> been<00:00:28.680> doing<00:00:28.769> this<00:00:28.949> for<00:00:29.160> 35

years came by this was a good he

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.790 
years came by this was a good he
explained<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.540> me<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.930> just<00:00:34.170> test<00:00:34.440> test

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
explained to me that you just test test

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.860 
explained to me that you just test test
the<00:00:34.950> edge<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.309> resistor<00:00:35.730> here<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.570> doesn't

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
the edge of the resistor here it doesn't

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.470 
the edge of the resistor here it doesn't
say<00:00:36.989> DSC<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.590> says<00:00:37.829> vs<00:00:38.160> CA<00:00:38.430> n<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.059> that's<00:00:39.239> where

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
say DSC it says vs CA n and that's where

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.310 
say DSC it says vs CA n and that's where
you<00:00:39.540> get<00:00:39.690> your<00:00:39.750> -<00:00:40.940> 195<00:00:41.940> volts<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.780> we<00:00:43.050> checked

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
you get your - 195 volts and we checked

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.119 
you get your - 195 volts and we checked
that<00:00:43.469> VA<00:00:43.710> which<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.309> on<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:45.059> top<00:00:45.270> end<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.629> the

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
that VA which is on the top end of the

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.540 
that VA which is on the top end of the
excess<00:00:47.129> stain<00:00:47.370> board<00:00:47.870> right<00:00:48.870> here<00:00:49.039> ve<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.190> mean

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
excess stain board right here ve I mean

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.660 
excess stain board right here ve I mean
did<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:50.879> say<00:00:51.030> VA<00:00:51.210> it's<00:00:51.449> vegan<00:00:51.629> V<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.469> we<00:00:53.430> had<00:00:53.550> our

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
did I say VA it's vegan V and we had our

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.850 
did I say VA it's vegan V and we had our
normal<00:00:53.940> voltage<00:00:54.239> there<00:00:54.480> -<00:00:54.780> which<00:00:55.050> was<00:00:55.289> 96

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
normal voltage there - which was 96

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.540 
normal voltage there - which was 96
volts<00:00:56.270> now<00:00:57.270> what<00:00:57.480> was<00:00:57.600> interesting<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:58.550> first

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
volts now what was interesting is first

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.099 
volts now what was interesting is first
thing<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.850> was<00:01:00.000> wondering<00:01:00.390> about<00:01:00.449> when<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:00.809> TV

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
thing I was wondering about when this TV

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.460 
thing I was wondering about when this TV
came<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.590> these<00:01:02.190> two<00:01:02.520> LEDs<00:01:03.090> were<00:01:03.719> for<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.170> TV

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
came in these two LEDs were for the TV

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.620 
came in these two LEDs were for the TV
wouldn't<00:01:04.650> come<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.189> completely<00:01:05.820> dead<00:01:06.000> no

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
wouldn't come on is completely dead no

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.289 
wouldn't come on is completely dead no
screen<00:01:07.280> lighting<00:01:08.280> up<00:01:08.400> whatsoever<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:09.119> these

screen lighting up whatsoever but these

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.410 
screen lighting up whatsoever but these
LEDs<00:01:10.140> were<00:01:10.290> flashing<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.700> logic<00:01:12.000> board

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
LEDs were flashing on this logic board

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.780 
LEDs were flashing on this logic board
here<00:01:12.770> one<00:01:13.770> right<00:01:13.950> here<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.250> one<00:01:14.400> right<00:01:14.430> here

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
here one right here and one right here

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.310 
here one right here and one right here
now<00:01:15.090> when<00:01:15.180> he<00:01:15.270> first<00:01:15.450> turned<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.869> on<00:01:15.990> there<00:01:16.229> was

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
now when he first turned it on there was

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.960 
now when he first turned it on there was
an<00:01:16.439> additional<00:01:16.830> LED<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.400> came<00:01:17.580> on<00:01:17.729> on<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
an additional LED that came on on the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:18.789 
an additional LED that came on on the
bottom

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
bottom

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.200

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
yeah just momentarily and then it shut

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.149 
yeah just momentarily and then it shut
off<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:23.990> now<00:01:24.990> whenever<00:01:25.200> I'm<00:01:25.560> fortunate<00:01:25.799> enough

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159

to watch what they do and I noticed

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.200 
to watch what they do and I noticed
first<00:01:31.950> thing<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.250> did<00:01:32.400> Dan<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.790> walked<00:01:33.000> up

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
first thing you did Dan you walked up

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.490 
first thing you did Dan you walked up
and<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.420> put<00:01:33.600> your<00:01:33.720> finger<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.049> each<00:01:34.259> one<00:01:34.439> of

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
and you put your finger on each one of

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.830 
and you put your finger on each one of
these<00:01:34.650> buffer<00:01:35.040> board<00:01:35.280> ICS<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:36.450> check<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.810> see

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
these buffer board ICS to check to see

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.050 
these buffer board ICS to check to see
if<00:01:37.020> an<00:01:37.140> Omaha<00:01:37.650> gently<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.400> same<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.939> that

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
if an Omaha gently the same and that

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.190 
if an Omaha gently the same and that
bitch<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.479> say<00:01:39.630> they<00:01:39.750> were<00:01:39.780> all<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> same

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
bitch and you say they were all the same

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.649 
bitch and you say they were all the same
temperature<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.890> notice<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.119> heat

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
temperature you notice that the heat

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.539 
temperature you notice that the heat
sinks<00:01:42.990> on<00:01:43.110> here<00:01:43.350> we're<00:01:43.500> good<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.920> toasty<00:01:44.369> hot

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
sinks on here we're good and toasty hot

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.700 
sinks on here we're good and toasty hot
which<00:01:45.240> means<00:01:45.600> your<00:01:45.720> y-sustain<00:01:45.899> board<00:01:46.259> has

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
which means your y-sustain board has

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.109 
which means your y-sustain board has
power<00:01:46.950> going<00:01:47.189> through<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.700> noticed<00:01:48.000> there

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
power going through it I noticed there

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.359 
power going through it I noticed there
were<00:01:48.180> no<00:01:48.329> shorts<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.840> ground<00:01:49.079> checking<00:01:49.979> on<00:01:50.189> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
were no shorts to ground checking on the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.139 
were no shorts to ground checking on the
vs<00:01:50.670> line<00:01:50.939> going<00:01:51.270> into<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.720> y-sustain<00:01:52.110> board

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
vs line going into the y-sustain board

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.149 
vs line going into the y-sustain board
and<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.540> had<00:01:54.720> my<00:01:54.899> five<00:01:55.170> volts<00:01:55.500> coming<00:01:55.799> out<00:01:56.040> of

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
and I had my five volts coming out of

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.310 
and I had my five volts coming out of
the<00:01:56.219> power<00:01:56.399> supply<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.790> checked<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.360> for<00:01:58.110> five

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
the power supply I checked that for five

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.819 
the power supply I checked that for five
point<00:01:58.590> three<00:01:58.649> in<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:59.009> case<00:02:00.380> didn't<00:02:01.380> find<00:02:01.590> any

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
point three in this case didn't find any

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.380 
point three in this case didn't find any
blown<00:02:02.040> fuses<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:03.259> so<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.969> asked<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.030> woman<00:02:06.149> I

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
blown fuses and so I asked the woman I

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.880 
blown fuses and so I asked the woman I
said<00:02:06.630> well<00:02:06.780> what<00:02:06.930> was<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.110> symptom<00:02:07.500> when<00:02:07.740> it

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
said well what was a symptom when it

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.010 
said well what was a symptom when it
first<00:02:08.179> started<00:02:09.179> giving<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.509> problems<00:02:09.720> before

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
first started giving you problems before

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.449 
first started giving you problems before
it<00:02:10.259> went<00:02:10.410> completely<00:02:10.619> dead<00:02:11.039> did<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.310> see

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
it went completely dead did you see

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.520 
it went completely dead did you see
anything<00:02:11.700> happened<00:02:12.090> at<00:02:12.180> all

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
anything happened at all

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.920 
anything happened at all
said<00:02:12.740> well<00:02:12.920> yeah<00:02:13.040> I<00:02:13.069> had<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.510> two-inch<00:02:14.510> vertical

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
said well yeah I had a two-inch vertical

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.020 
said well yeah I had a two-inch vertical
bar<00:02:15.110> going<00:02:15.380> from<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.709> top<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:16.069> the<00:02:16.100> bottom<00:02:19.030> so

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
bar going from the top to the bottom so

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.790 
bar going from the top to the bottom so
hearing<00:02:20.450> about<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.840> two<00:02:21.020> inch<00:02:21.170> vertical<00:02:21.590> bar

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
hearing about the two inch vertical bar

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.949 
hearing about the two inch vertical bar
that<00:02:22.069> gave<00:02:22.250> me<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.459> clue<00:02:22.760> as<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:23.090> where<00:02:23.810> the

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
that gave me a clue as to where the

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.510 
that gave me a clue as to where the
problem<00:02:24.170> might<00:02:24.500> lie<00:02:24.709> so<00:02:24.980> I<00:02:25.040> started<00:02:25.310> thinking

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
problem might lie so I started thinking

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.090 
problem might lie so I started thinking
perhaps<00:02:25.910> a<00:02:26.209> shorted<00:02:26.600> X<00:02:27.230> address<00:02:27.620> board<00:02:27.950> or

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
perhaps a shorted X address board or

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.370 
perhaps a shorted X address board or
what<00:02:28.250> Dan<00:02:28.430> calls<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.880> C<00:02:29.060> board<00:02:29.330> board<00:02:30.110> at<00:02:30.290> the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
what Dan calls the C board board at the

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.850 
what Dan calls the C board board at the
bottom<00:02:30.680> here<00:02:30.860> so<00:02:31.900> Dan<00:02:32.900> used<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.290> isolation

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
bottom here so Dan used the isolation

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.460 
bottom here so Dan used the isolation
technique<00:02:34.250> what<00:02:34.459> he<00:02:34.580> did<00:02:34.760> was<00:02:34.940> he<00:02:35.470> he

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
technique what he did was he he

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.860 
technique what he did was he he
unplugged<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.190> cable<00:02:37.370> going<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.569> exit

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
unplugged the cable going to the exit

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.559 
unplugged the cable going to the exit
dress<00:02:39.050> board<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:40.700> see<00:02:40.910> if<00:02:40.940> anything<00:02:41.450> would

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
dress board to see if anything would

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.690 
dress board to see if anything would
change<00:02:41.630> when<00:02:42.080> he<00:02:42.170> did<00:02:42.380> we've<00:02:43.220> got<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.489> start

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
change when he did we've got to start

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.190 
change when he did we've got to start
getting<00:02:43.910> half<00:02:44.150> a<00:02:44.180> screen<00:02:44.600> which<00:02:44.870> is<00:02:45.019> better

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
getting half a screen which is better

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.660 
getting half a screen which is better
than<00:02:45.440> nothing<00:02:45.709> we<00:02:45.830> didn't<00:02:46.070> get<00:02:46.160> any<00:02:46.340> screen

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
than nothing we didn't get any screen

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.880 
than nothing we didn't get any screen
before<00:02:46.880> so<00:02:47.870> this<00:02:48.050> side<00:02:48.260> of<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:48.440> screen<00:02:48.680> came

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
before so this side of the screen came

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.160 
before so this side of the screen came
on<00:02:49.100> so<00:02:49.400> we<00:02:49.519> started<00:02:49.820> thinking<00:02:50.060> okay<00:02:50.180> this<00:02:50.510> this

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
on so we started thinking okay this this

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.840 
on so we started thinking okay this this
X<00:02:51.440> dress<00:02:51.739> board<00:02:51.980> maybe<00:02:52.130> it's<00:02:52.310> got<00:02:52.430> a<00:02:52.459> short<00:02:52.730> to

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
X dress board maybe it's got a short to

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.759 
X dress board maybe it's got a short to
ground<00:02:53.060> or<00:02:53.269> perhaps<00:02:53.840> even<00:02:54.050> the<00:02:54.200> panel's<00:02:54.560> got<00:02:54.739> a

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
ground or perhaps even the panel's got a

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.920 
ground or perhaps even the panel's got a
problem<00:02:55.070> panels<00:02:56.060> have<00:02:56.209> been<00:02:56.300> known<00:02:56.450> to<00:02:56.480> go<00:02:56.720> bad

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
problem panels have been known to go bad

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.229 
problem panels have been known to go bad
and<00:02:57.140> cause<00:02:57.319> various<00:02:57.650> problems<00:02:57.709> I<00:02:58.250> also<00:02:58.910> spoke

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
and cause various problems I also spoke

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.960 
and cause various problems I also spoke
to<00:02:59.300> my<00:02:59.510> friend<00:02:59.690> Damon<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.560> plasma<00:03:01.310> TV<00:03:01.580> expert

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
to my friend Damon the plasma TV expert

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.090 
to my friend Damon the plasma TV expert
and<00:03:02.090> he<00:03:02.180> mentioned<00:03:02.600> he'd<00:03:02.720> seen<00:03:02.989> vertical<00:03:03.890> bars

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
and he mentioned he'd seen vertical bars

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.240 
and he mentioned he'd seen vertical bars
occur<00:03:04.489> from<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:06.140> buffers<00:03:06.530> on<00:03:06.800> the<00:03:07.010> logic

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
occur from the buffers on the logic

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.610 
occur from the buffers on the logic
board<00:03:07.430> going<00:03:07.910> bad<00:03:08.090> so<00:03:08.330> that<00:03:09.230> was<00:03:09.380> another

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
board going bad so that was another

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.070 
board going bad so that was another
possibility<00:03:10.160> too<00:03:10.459> but<00:03:10.670> in<00:03:10.760> this<00:03:10.850> case<00:03:11.090> as<00:03:11.330> my

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
possibility too but in this case as my

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.050 
possibility too but in this case as my
friend<00:03:12.319> Dan<00:03:12.530> began<00:03:13.010> unplugging<00:03:13.489> each<00:03:13.760> one<00:03:13.970> of

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
friend Dan began unplugging each one of

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.800 
friend Dan began unplugging each one of
these<00:03:14.150> cables<00:03:14.600> here<00:03:14.840> and<00:03:15.400> putting<00:03:16.400> them<00:03:16.519> back

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
these cables here and putting them back

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.330 
these cables here and putting them back
all<00:03:17.810> of<00:03:18.049> a<00:03:18.079> sudden<00:03:18.170> guess<00:03:18.590> what<00:03:18.829> I<00:03:18.860> had<00:03:19.100> full

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
all of a sudden guess what I had full

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.640 
all of a sudden guess what I had full
picture<00:03:19.750> hard<00:03:20.750> to<00:03:20.840> believe<00:03:21.079> that's<00:03:21.260> all<00:03:21.500> it

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
picture hard to believe that's all it

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.740 
picture hard to believe that's all it
was<00:03:21.860> unless<00:03:22.340> it<00:03:22.519> were<00:03:22.790> just<00:03:23.000> lucky<00:03:23.180> maybe<00:03:23.570> it

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
was unless it were just lucky maybe it

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.330 
was unless it were just lucky maybe it
was<00:03:23.870> something<00:03:24.110> unrelated<00:03:24.709> but<00:03:24.799> it<00:03:24.920> seems<00:03:25.190> it

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
was something unrelated but it seems it

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.890 
was something unrelated but it seems it
was<00:03:25.489> just<00:03:25.670> a<00:03:25.760> matter<00:03:25.940> of<00:03:26.060> receding<00:03:26.750> these

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
was just a matter of receding these

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.979 
was just a matter of receding these
ribbon<00:03:27.230> cables<00:03:27.579> who<00:03:28.579> would<00:03:28.730> have<00:03:28.850> figured<00:03:28.989> but

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
ribbon cables who would have figured but

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.780 
ribbon cables who would have figured but
yet<00:03:30.140> we<00:03:30.290> got<00:03:30.440> full<00:03:30.680> picture<00:03:30.890> now<00:03:31.160> so<00:03:31.579> we<00:03:31.700> need

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
yet we got full picture now so we need

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:32.979 
yet we got full picture now so we need
to<00:03:31.910> let<00:03:32.030> it<00:03:32.120> run<00:03:32.269> for<00:03:32.450> a<00:03:32.510> while<00:03:32.630> and<00:03:32.750> see<00:03:32.900> if

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
to let it run for a while and see if

fuses oh and that other point I made it

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.430 
fuses oh and that other point I made it
first<00:03:56.150> was<00:03:56.390> the<00:03:56.600> S<00:03:56.840> vs<00:03:57.410> C<00:03:58.299> I<00:03:59.299> was<00:04:00.049> looking<00:04:00.260> for<00:04:00.410> I

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
first was the S vs C I was looking for I

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.220 
first was the S vs C I was looking for I
was<00:04:00.620> looking<00:04:00.890> for<00:04:01.100> a<00:04:01.130> little<00:04:01.280> test<00:04:02.030> point<00:04:02.329> for

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
was looking for a little test point for

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.300 
was looking for a little test point for
the<00:04:03.380> VSC

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
the VSC

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.830 
the VSC
and<00:04:04.579> I<00:04:04.790> didn't<00:04:05.030> realize<00:04:05.299> it<00:04:05.450> was<00:04:05.570> just<00:04:05.600> the

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
and I didn't realize it was just the

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.650 
and I didn't realize it was just the
side<00:04:06.049> of<00:04:06.170> the<00:04:06.260> resistor<00:04:06.650> here<00:04:06.799> B<00:04:07.010> SC<00:04:07.190> a<00:04:07.579> n<00:04:07.910> same

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
side of the resistor here B SC a n same

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.289 
side of the resistor here B SC a n same
thing<00:04:08.870> anyway<00:04:09.230> I<00:04:09.440> think<00:04:09.739> that's<00:04:10.100> enough<00:04:11.000> here

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
thing anyway I think that's enough here

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.479 
thing anyway I think that's enough here
so<00:04:12.260> hopefully<00:04:12.890> you<00:04:12.980> found<00:04:13.010> this<00:04:13.310> video

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
so hopefully you found this video

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.940 
so hopefully you found this video
helpful
