00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.109 

that<00:00:23.160> would<00:00:23.220> be<00:00:24.590> mm<00:00:25.590> covered<00:00:26.340> up<00:00:26.519> covering<00:00:26.970> up

what<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.420> didn't<00:00:27.779> finish<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.230> as<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.470> can<00:00:28.560> tell

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
what I didn't finish so as you can tell

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.380 
what I didn't finish so as you can tell
though<00:00:30.109> this<00:00:31.109> video<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:32.040> kind<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.660> wonky<00:00:33.660> and

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
though this video is kind of wonky and

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.260 
though this video is kind of wonky and
it's<00:00:36.390> because<00:00:37.140> i<00:00:37.710> was<00:00:38.309> taking<00:00:38.760> down<00:00:38.969> that

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
it's because i was taking down that

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.660 
it's because i was taking down that
sound<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:40.910> I<00:00:41.910> reverse<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.360> video<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.680> you'll

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
sound and I reverse the video so you'll

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.819 
sound and I reverse the video so you'll
see<00:00:44.910> all<00:00:45.120> stuff<00:00:45.780> flying<00:00:46.110> around<00:00:46.289> like<00:00:46.559> that

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
about in the morning i'm doing this

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.840 
about in the morning i'm doing this
place<00:01:26.009> over<00:01:26.369> parades<00:01:27.150> way<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.140> did<00:01:28.530> yarn<00:01:28.890> great

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
place over parades way I did yarn great

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.240 
place over parades way I did yarn great
and<00:01:30.390> pretty<00:01:30.840> much<00:01:30.900> i<00:01:31.229> braided<00:01:31.560> them<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:31.979> and

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
and pretty much i braided them in and

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.280 
and pretty much i braided them in and
then<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.729> wrapped<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.420> piece<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.750> yarn<00:01:34.140> around

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
then I wrapped a piece of yarn around

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.679 
then I wrapped a piece of yarn around
them<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.799> make<00:01:34.979> them<00:01:35.130> look<00:01:35.280> more<00:01:35.610> dread<00:01:36.420> like

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
them to make them look more dread like

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.859 
them to make them look more dread like
because<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.049> don't<00:01:37.290> really<00:01:37.350> like<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.869> yarn

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
because I don't really like the yarn

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.830 
because I don't really like the yarn

putting<00:01:57.869> them<00:01:58.049> into<00:01:58.259> sections<00:01:58.710> because<00:01:58.890> i'm

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
putting them into sections because i'm

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.120 
putting them into sections because i'm
taking<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.460> down<00:01:59.700> but<00:02:00.229> you'll<00:02:01.229> see<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.829> just

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
taking it down but you'll see you just

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.810 
taking it down but you'll see you just
see<00:02:02.310> me<00:02:02.340> taking

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
see me taking

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.930 
see me taking
this<00:02:04.180> is<00:02:04.360> whatever<00:02:04.920> right<00:02:05.920> if<00:02:06.370> you<00:02:06.520> can<00:02:06.700> see

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
this is whatever right if you can see

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.639 
this is whatever right if you can see
the<00:02:07.090> fuzzy<00:02:07.390> part<00:02:07.570> in<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:08.020> middle<00:02:08.229> of<00:02:08.259> my<00:02:08.380> head

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
the fuzzy part in the middle of my head

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.230 
the fuzzy part in the middle of my head
that's<00:02:08.979> because<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.490> middle<00:02:09.729> of<00:02:09.759> my<00:02:09.820> head<00:02:10.090> is

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
that's because the middle of my head is

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.940 
that's because the middle of my head is
not<00:02:10.420> finished<00:02:10.990> it's<00:02:11.230> not<00:02:11.410> breathing<00:02:11.800> in

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
not finished it's not breathing in

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.010 
not finished it's not breathing in
actually<00:02:12.370> my<00:02:12.760> whole<00:02:13.000> entire<00:02:13.180> head<00:02:13.720> is<00:02:13.870> not

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
actually my whole entire head is not

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.840 
actually my whole entire head is not
finished<00:02:14.380> it's<00:02:15.130> pretty<00:02:15.310> much<00:02:16.380> only<00:02:17.380> five<00:02:18.160> ten

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
finished it's pretty much only five ten

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.680 
finished it's pretty much only five ten
percent<00:02:19.330> of<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:19.570> is<00:02:19.690> wrapped<00:02:20.050> in<00:02:20.520> 95<00:02:21.690> ninety

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
percent of it is wrapped in 95 ninety

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.590 
percent of it is wrapped in 95 ninety
percent<00:02:22.840> of<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.350> it's<00:02:23.680> just<00:02:23.920> braided<00:02:24.370> in<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:25.510> I

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
percent of it it's just braided in and I

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.060 
percent of it it's just braided in and I
stuff<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:26.050> rap<00:02:26.260> that's<00:02:26.560> why<00:02:26.709> I<00:02:26.740> had<00:02:26.920> this

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
stuff the rap that's why I had this

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.760 
stuff the rap that's why I had this
excess<00:02:27.640> yarn<00:02:28.120> but<00:02:28.570> what<00:02:28.780> you<00:02:28.959> see<00:02:29.140> right<00:02:29.170> here
