00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.040 

so<00:01:15.340> the<00:01:16.119> first<00:01:16.390> of<00:01:16.540> all-first

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
so the first of all-first

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.330 
so the first of all-first
like<00:01:17.140> I<00:01:17.170> say<00:01:17.290> it's<00:01:17.380> in<00:01:17.440> full<00:01:17.649> force<00:01:17.979> so<00:01:18.130> we've

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
like I say it's in full force so we've

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.940 
like I say it's in full force so we've
got<00:01:18.460> four<00:01:18.700> beats<00:01:18.940> of<00:01:19.060> the<00:01:19.119> bar<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:20.259> first<00:01:20.530> two

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
got four beats of the bar the first two

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.710 
got four beats of the bar the first two
beams<00:01:21.220> are<00:01:21.340> exactly<00:01:21.640> the<00:01:21.759> same<00:01:21.789> as<00:01:22.149> each<00:01:22.270> other

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
beams are exactly the same as each other

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.570 
beams are exactly the same as each other
so<00:01:23.229> we're<00:01:23.440> up<00:01:23.590> on<00:01:23.740> the<00:01:23.860> right<00:01:24.009> cymbal<00:01:24.399> with<00:01:24.490> the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
so we're up on the right cymbal with the

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.040 
so we're up on the right cymbal with the
right<00:01:24.759> hands<00:01:25.210> and<00:01:25.330> we're<00:01:25.450> playing<00:01:25.660> the<00:01:25.780> right

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
right hands and we're playing the right

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.359 
right hands and we're playing the right
emotion<00:01:26.649> up<00:01:26.740> together

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
emotion up together

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.960 
emotion up together
and<00:01:27.670> then<00:01:28.420> two<00:01:28.720> left-hand<00:01:29.259> notes<00:01:29.560> so<00:01:30.280> one<00:01:30.610> trip

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
and then two left-hand notes so one trip

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.529 
and then two left-hand notes so one trip
words<00:01:31.330> and<00:01:31.690> therefore<00:01:32.350> two<00:01:32.470> triplet<00:01:32.710> as<00:01:32.860> well

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
words and therefore two triplet as well

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:35.430 
words and therefore two triplet as well
and<00:01:34.539> those<00:01:34.720> three<00:01:34.929> notes<00:01:35.110> need<00:01:35.200> to<00:01:35.259> be

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
and those three notes need to be

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:51.740 
and those three notes need to be
smoothly<00:01:35.800> to<00:01:36.070> flow<00:01:36.340> smoothly<00:01:47.940> either

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
left Lam flam tap a left Lam tap so

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.440 
left Lam flam tap a left Lam tap so
you're<00:02:53.680> playing<00:02:53.950> a<00:02:54.220> left-handed<00:02:54.790> flam<00:02:55.030> right

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
you're playing a left-handed flam right

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.410 
you're playing a left-handed flam right
hand<00:02:55.630> comes<00:02:55.810> down<00:02:55.870> first<00:02:56.260> left<00:02:56.530> hand<00:02:56.709> seconds

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
hand comes down first left hand seconds

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.340 
hand comes down first left hand seconds
followed<00:02:58.420> by<00:02:58.450> another<00:02:58.959> left<00:03:01.050> left

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
followed by another left left

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.979 
followed by another left left
really<00:03:05.070> and<00:03:06.120> then<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.270> sticking<00:03:07.630> just<00:03:07.780> works

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
really and then the sticking just works

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.300 
really and then the sticking just works
its<00:03:08.170> way<00:03:08.350> out<00:03:08.380> so<00:03:08.739> you<00:03:08.830> get<00:03:08.980> left<00:03:09.670> left<00:03:10.090> left<00:03:11.310> if

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
its way out so you get left left left if

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.220 
its way out so you get left left left if
you<00:03:12.459> also<00:03:12.580> play<00:03:12.880> as<00:03:13.090> a<00:03:13.120> right<00:03:13.390> hand<00:03:13.660> flan<00:03:13.930> and

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
you also play as a right hand flan and

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:22.010 
you also play as a right hand flan and
then<00:03:14.800> left

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:28.229 

version<00:03:26.010> but<00:03:27.010> both<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.549> sticking<00:03:27.880> works<00:03:28.060> out

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
version but both the sticking works out

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:29.880 
version but both the sticking works out
the<00:03:28.299> same<00:03:28.480> either<00:03:28.600> a<00:03:28.690> Roy<00:03:28.930> ham<00:03:29.170> fan<00:03:29.470> of<00:03:29.620> a<00:03:29.680> left

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
the same either a Roy ham fan of a left

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.370 
the same either a Roy ham fan of a left
or<00:03:30.190> left<00:03:30.820> half<00:03:31.090> that<00:03:31.269> mother<00:03:31.540> left<00:03:31.750> whenever

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
or left half that mother left whenever

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.110
