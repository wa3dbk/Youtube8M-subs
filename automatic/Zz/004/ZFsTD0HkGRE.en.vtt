 knowledge of networks or those things we 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.920
 we are going to occupy this pay to maintain 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.829
 our terms we are going to occupy 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.289
 absolutely nothing we're just going to 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.960
 occupy two things our device with 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.930
 minecraft pocket edition and our 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.789
 move and well what we have to do 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.559
 more to go to the page of our model 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.890
 as you can see here markers my 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.890
 model 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.690
 well in this case I have the modem 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.650
 telmex that gives you the way it gives you 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.390
 telmex and hg 532 and this I do not know what 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.000
 modem have you but for example in 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.740
 Telmex in the user will always be 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.899
 telmex if I'm not always always wrong 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.700
 is going to do telmex and in password should 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.040
 put the wifi key they see and in their 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.710
 modem and well for example I put it 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.710
 is saved let's give login 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.439
 and well this is not all furniture going to 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.030
 to be equal if you touched them this systems 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.890
 they have this same way in which I 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.680
 how fabulous because they were in the same 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.280
 what am I going to do here and they will have their server 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.590
 this and we will do our server 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.270
 well this depends on each mode in download 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.280
 different but I hope you know 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.500
 adapt what type of model 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.530
 technically it will be similar 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:55.420
 we love you in advanced and we go when 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:57.790
 says nothing do not see anything there is here and we 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.040
 appears this window appears now 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.420
 we're going to application editing 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.490
 So you can see that you are 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.170
 applications that I'm supposed to have 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.510
 in my model this but down to 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.460
 down here we create in a new 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.470
 application we are going to put you minecraft and 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:21.080
 as I already have it here bodies of 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:23.840
 party like this we give you to save 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.750
 and nothing is going to come out of all this now we 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.230
 come on let's go to new district alerted 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.140
 of this in the port we change tsp 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.840
 port dp 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.760
 and in internal port we are going to put the 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.410
 that manages minecraft because the edition 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:43.960
 that I'm not wrong the 19 132 132 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:49.510
 here we have one 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:53.500
 to the other those from 19 132 to 19 132 and to see 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.000
 to see already almost 19 132 to 19 132 in him 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.819
 It will always be the same in all 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.010
 932 to 19 132 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.909
 fill in the four blocks nineteen 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.909
 one hundred thirty two 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.140
 to see and with the other thing I have left 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.390
 exactly so if they are left like this already 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.980
 We will have to save and wait for 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.640
 charge we wait for him to charge if I do not 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.580
 I will charge no longer to see stupid 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.410
 we have our service here 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.130
 now what follows we go to map of 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.570
 door and application we look for minecraft 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.460
 pocket edition as you can see that the 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.310
 I have this up we selected it 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.320
 we select it and in interface what 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.020
 let's be as is motorcycle amphitheater 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.510
 we do not move anything and the hobby in terno 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.550
 internal we must select the 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.920
 device where we believe that this 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:49.180
 distributor or the device where 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.620
 we are going to open the server in this case 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.430
 well you have to know which one is yours 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:04:01.030
 mine is android without script 5 to 16 17 a 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:03.240
 8 778 38 19 you selected it and we give it in 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.240
 save 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.470
 we want you to wait and you can see 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.660
 up here appears that is here 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.000
 to enter internet television I think 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.940
 that domestic front will activate and now 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.269
 is activated 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.190
 now in this case 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.940
 once we have this we are going to this 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:27.550
 page from here 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.249
 here in my life we enter here and what is 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.789
 my faith 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:35.489
 to see here here you have to give 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:38.759
 your server is going to be this 180 good at 

00:04:35.489 --> 00:04:42.160
 my case my server would be 189 points 164 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:44.200
 points 61 point 116 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.450
 then the server that you have 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.770
 have to give her friends but they have 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:53.580
 that give who they want is the game goes 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:56.590
 to be 189 point 164 points 61 points 116 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.590
 another thing telmex changes your 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.940
 configuration of your way in each 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.340
 trust that I'm feet I'm saying 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.290
 but this change tweets every so often 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.000
 so every time they go to miguel server 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.230
 you must enter this page and check that 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.670
 They do not know if changing the air 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.620
 change in management that simply in 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:15.460
 the test and already 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:19.310
 from live like to be 189 point 164 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.770
 points 61 points 116 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:26.440
 and that are going to be beautiful we will go to 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.440
 vision transport we go to here 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.560
 lady the external already and the cb name in that 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.980
 be and in the address you have to put the 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.410
 address that previously in that given 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:41.200
 although glue from the page to see 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:44.830
 where is where is 25 here by 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:48.730
 one hundred 89 points 164 points 61 points 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:51.970
 2016 that would be the ip mister see and the 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:53.290
 contribution of 100 equal and nothing already added 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.340
 this in the clica and of the people who 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:57.550
 they are going to join and you are simply 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.840
 want to open the one they want to talk 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.140
 for example I have the first break and 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.140
 chilo 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:07.980
 the topic goes to the ip and it comes in 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:11.660
 to enter this map 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:14.270
 but this does not enter this map 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.650
 and nothing and I expect less cargo was going to 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.080
 espanyol the pressure of the background 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.970
 world is over there if I leave and 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.130
 for example I leave the play and enter 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.870
 pixel archs that by the way have a 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:27.210
 Kirby to the wing in some of the monster 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:30.240
 of my pyxel arts this one 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.199
 to see this one that said clear to this one if 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.240
 feel someone else 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:34.979
 this is going to enter that this map and good 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.780
 guys who by the way of sexy mind 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:38.669
 of this option so they can join 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.460
 local terme multiplayer have to 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:43.349
 have it activated so you can enter and 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.810
