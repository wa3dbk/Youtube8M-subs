00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
levels of course and I'm just gonna play

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.229 
levels of course and I'm just gonna play
it<00:00:58.440> one<00:00:58.800> time<00:00:59.010> through<00:00:59.370> there<00:00:59.670> are<00:00:59.760> two<00:00:59.910> runs

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
it one time through there are two runs

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.140 
it one time through there are two runs
on<00:01:00.539> each<00:01:01.260> map<00:01:01.640> skip<00:01:04.339> and<00:01:05.339> then<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:05.850> we<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:05.970> to

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
on each map skip and then so we have to

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.700 
on each map skip and then so we have to
bend<00:01:06.360> down<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:07.260> course

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
bend down of course

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.260 
bend down of course
get<00:01:08.520> ready<00:01:09.229> raise<00:01:10.229> our<00:01:10.409> hand<00:01:10.590> above<00:01:11.100> our<00:01:12.090> head
