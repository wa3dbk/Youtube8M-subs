two kids in the story but also between

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.020 
two kids in the story but also between
the<00:02:38.020> parents<00:02:38.410> as<00:02:38.530> they<00:02:38.710> sort<00:02:39.010> of<00:02:39.250> cling<00:02:39.760> to

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
the parents as they sort of cling to

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.120 
the parents as they sort of cling to
whatever<00:02:40.270> they<00:02:40.540> can<00:02:40.600> to<00:02:41.110> remind<00:02:41.650> them<00:02:41.800> of<00:02:41.950> home

whatever they can to remind them of home
but<00:02:42.520> which<00:02:42.610> is<00:02:42.730> definitely<00:02:43.090> something<00:02:43.540> that<00:02:43.570> I

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
but which is definitely something that I

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.410 
but which is definitely something that I
think<00:02:43.990> most<00:02:44.590> immigrants<00:02:45.400> in<00:02:45.580> America<00:02:46.330> are

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
think most immigrants in America are

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.710 
think most immigrants in America are
probably<00:02:46.900> in<00:02:47.050> any<00:02:47.170> country<00:02:47.590> do<00:02:47.830> they<00:02:48.310> cling<00:02:48.610> to

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
probably in any country do they cling to

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.030 
probably in any country do they cling to
something<00:02:49.720> that<00:02:49.900> seems<00:02:50.230> familiar<00:02:50.440> to<00:02:50.770> them

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
something that seems familiar to them

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.250 
something that seems familiar to them
because<00:02:51.400> everything<00:02:51.910> else<00:02:52.060> in<00:02:52.300> that<00:02:52.330> world<00:02:52.930> is

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
because everything else in that world is

this president because you know he was a

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.330 
this president because you know he was a
person<00:03:28.570> of<00:03:28.660> color<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:28.960> he<00:03:29.590> brought<00:03:29.830> about<00:03:30.070> all

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
of these ideas about change and that was

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.860 
of these ideas about change and that was
a<00:03:32.890> big<00:03:33.160> platform<00:03:33.760> and<00:03:34.090> you<00:03:34.450> know<00:03:34.540> it<00:03:34.690> brought

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
a big platform and you know it brought

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.230 
a big platform and you know it brought
about<00:03:35.020> a<00:03:35.080> lot<00:03:35.230> of<00:03:35.440> Hope<00:03:35.620> in<00:03:35.770> people<00:03:36.160> who<00:03:36.490> were

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
about a lot of Hope in people who were

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.750 
about a lot of Hope in people who were
you<00:03:38.020> know<00:03:38.050> not<00:03:38.380> white<00:03:38.890> and<00:03:39.310> I<00:03:39.430> thought<00:03:39.550> that

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
you know not white and I thought that

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.400 
you know not white and I thought that
was<00:03:39.850> really<00:03:40.000> interesting<00:03:40.120> to<00:03:40.570> touch<00:03:40.930> on<00:03:41.170> that

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
was really interesting to touch on that

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.830 
was really interesting to touch on that
and<00:03:41.650> then<00:03:41.740> she<00:03:42.100> touches<00:03:42.430> on<00:03:42.580> it<00:03:42.790> again<00:03:43.420> later

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
and then she touches on it again later

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.720 
and then she touches on it again later
in<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.350> book<00:03:44.560> a<00:03:44.740> little<00:03:44.920> bit<00:03:45.070> more<00:03:45.370> when

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
in the book a little bit more when

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.400 
in the book a little bit more when
President<00:03:46.270> Obama<00:03:46.300> has<00:03:46.690> been<00:03:46.810> in<00:03:46.870> office<00:03:47.050> for<00:03:47.260> a

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
President Obama has been in office for a

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.900 
President Obama has been in office for a
little<00:03:47.650> while<00:03:47.830> kind<00:03:48.220> of<00:03:48.310> just<00:03:48.520> the

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
little while kind of just the

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.699 
little while kind of just the
realization<00:03:49.540> that<00:03:49.690> this<00:03:49.870> one<00:03:50.050> man<00:03:50.260> couldn't

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
realization that this one man couldn't

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.710 
realization that this one man couldn't
do<00:03:50.890> quite<00:03:51.520> as<00:03:51.640> much<00:03:51.670> as<00:03:52.030> everyone<00:03:52.330> hoped<00:03:52.630> he

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
do quite as much as everyone hoped he

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.390 
do quite as much as everyone hoped he
could<00:03:52.750> and<00:03:53.170> obviously<00:03:53.470> while<00:03:53.650> talking<00:03:53.890> about

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
could and obviously while talking about

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.310 
could and obviously while talking about
immigrant<00:03:54.850> stories<00:03:55.209> and<00:03:55.570> immigration<00:03:56.200> in

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
immigrant stories and immigration in

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.610 
immigrant stories and immigration in
general<00:03:56.680> there<00:03:56.890> might<00:03:57.459> be<00:03:57.490> a<00:03:57.640> little<00:03:58.000> bit<00:03:58.270> of

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
general there might be a little bit of

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.410 
general there might be a little bit of
politics<00:03:59.620> that<00:03:59.860> come<00:04:00.070> into<00:04:00.220> play<00:04:00.310> but<00:04:01.000> I<00:04:01.060> think

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
politics that come into play but I think

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.660 
politics that come into play but I think
this<00:04:01.660> book<00:04:01.900> does<00:04:02.050> a<00:04:02.080> really<00:04:02.380> good<00:04:02.530> job<00:04:02.740> of<00:04:03.070> not

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
this book does a really good job of not

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.060 
this book does a really good job of not
necessarily<00:04:04.360> landing<00:04:05.350> on<00:04:05.440> one<00:04:05.590> side<00:04:05.830> or<00:04:05.980> the

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
necessarily landing on one side or the

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.530 
necessarily landing on one side or the
other<00:04:06.250> like<00:04:06.280> obviously<00:04:06.910> these<00:04:07.090> characters

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
other like obviously these characters

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.750 
other like obviously these characters
are<00:04:07.750> going<00:04:07.930> to<00:04:08.230> fall<00:04:08.590> on<00:04:08.800> a<00:04:08.830> specific<00:04:09.100> side<00:04:09.550> of

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
are going to fall on a specific side of

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.340 
are going to fall on a specific side of
the<00:04:09.880> issue<00:04:10.060> but<00:04:10.420> that's<00:04:10.630> not<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:11.020> point<00:04:11.290> of

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
the issue but that's not the point of

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.870 
the issue but that's not the point of
this<00:04:11.470> book<00:04:11.709> this<00:04:11.980> book<00:04:12.040> isn't<00:04:12.520> about<00:04:12.670> the

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
this book this book isn't about the

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.730 
this book this book isn't about the
issues<00:04:13.270> is<00:04:13.480> just<00:04:13.510> about<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:14.080> characters<00:04:14.500> but

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
issues is just about the characters but

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.680 
issues is just about the characters but
like<00:04:15.040> if<00:04:15.250> you<00:04:15.459> were<00:04:15.640> an<00:04:16.000> immigrant<00:04:16.780> in<00:04:17.080> America

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
like if you were an immigrant in America

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.240 
like if you were an immigrant in America
at<00:04:17.900> this<00:04:18.110> time<00:04:18.350> period<00:04:18.800> like<00:04:18.950> you're<00:04:19.100> gonna

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
at this time period like you're gonna

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.190 
at this time period like you're gonna
have<00:04:19.489> thoughts<00:04:19.730> about<00:04:20.150> immigration<00:04:20.600> reform

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
have thoughts about immigration reform

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.330 
have thoughts about immigration reform
and<00:04:21.320> things<00:04:21.500> like<00:04:21.620> that<00:04:21.680> but<00:04:22.010> they<00:04:22.190> don't

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
and things like that but they don't

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.490 
and things like that but they don't
really<00:04:22.550> talk<00:04:22.790> about<00:04:22.850> it<00:04:23.150> hugely<00:04:23.510> so<00:04:24.170> it's<00:04:24.320> not

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
really talk about it hugely so it's not

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.920 
really talk about it hugely so it's not
like<00:04:24.830> if<00:04:25.160> you<00:04:25.490> have<00:04:25.760> a<00:04:26.150> certain<00:04:26.420> political

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
like if you have a certain political

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.180 
like if you have a certain political
opinion<00:04:27.260> you're<00:04:27.380> going<00:04:27.560> to<00:04:27.680> be<00:04:27.800> upset<00:04:28.070> with

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
opinion you're going to be upset with

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.380 
opinion you're going to be upset with
this<00:04:28.310> book<00:04:28.520> but<00:04:28.790> I<00:04:28.880> just<00:04:29.060> thought<00:04:29.180> it<00:04:29.240> was

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
this book but I just thought it was

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.850 
this book but I just thought it was
really<00:04:29.630> interesting<00:04:30.080> that<00:04:30.110> she<00:04:30.410> decided<00:04:30.710> to

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
really interesting that she decided to

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.040 
really interesting that she decided to
bring<00:04:31.460> in<00:04:31.640> that<00:04:31.850> specific<00:04:32.210> current<00:04:32.780> event

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
bring in that specific current event

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.110 
bring in that specific current event
into<00:04:33.410> the<00:04:33.530> book<00:04:33.710> and<00:04:34.040> sort<00:04:34.340> of<00:04:34.460> make<00:04:34.730> it<00:04:34.760> more

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
into the book and sort of make it more

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.450 
into the book and sort of make it more
grounded<00:04:35.870> in<00:04:36.020> reality<00:04:36.200> than<00:04:36.800> other<00:04:36.980> books<00:04:37.250> do

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
grounded in reality than other books do

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.830 
grounded in reality than other books do
like<00:04:37.670> this<00:04:37.790> very<00:04:38.000> much<00:04:38.180> could<00:04:38.360> have<00:04:38.510> been<00:04:38.630> a

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
like this very much could have been a

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.650 
like this very much could have been a
story<00:04:39.320> that<00:04:39.680> took<00:04:40.280> place<00:04:40.460> in<00:04:40.790> the<00:04:40.880> 90s<00:04:41.300> as<00:04:41.480> much

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
story that took place in the 90s as much

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.630 
story that took place in the 90s as much
as<00:04:41.870> it<00:04:42.020> took<00:04:42.140> place<00:04:42.200> in<00:04:42.440> the<00:04:42.740> 2000s<00:04:43.460> you<00:04:43.490> know

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
as it took place in the 2000s you know

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.740 
as it took place in the 2000s you know
what<00:04:43.730> I<00:04:43.790> mean<00:04:44.000> so<00:04:44.270> I<00:04:44.300> thought<00:04:44.540> it<00:04:44.660> was

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
what I mean so I thought it was

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.960 
what I mean so I thought it was
interesting<00:04:44.900> to<00:04:45.410> have<00:04:45.890> that<00:04:46.220> specific<00:04:46.820> event

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
interesting to have that specific event

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.600 
interesting to have that specific event
that<00:04:47.390> really<00:04:47.540> grounds<00:04:48.530> the<00:04:48.680> timeline<00:04:49.190> a<00:04:49.220> lot

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
that really grounds the timeline a lot

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.880 
that really grounds the timeline a lot
you<00:04:49.940> read<00:04:50.150> this<00:04:50.300> story<00:04:50.540> and<00:04:50.690> I<00:04:50.990> was<00:04:51.140> pulled<00:04:51.740> in

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.080

characters but I wasn't really sure what
story<00:04:56.120> they<00:04:56.300> were<00:04:56.360> trying<00:04:56.720> to<00:04:56.870> tell<00:04:57.110> but<00:04:57.440> that

story they were trying to tell but that

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.560 
story they were trying to tell but that
by<00:04:57.920> the<00:04:58.010> end<00:04:58.220> of<00:04:58.370> it<00:04:58.490> I<00:04:58.670> had<00:04:58.940> no<00:04:59.090> idea<00:04:59.210> this

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
by the end of it I had no idea this

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.300 
by the end of it I had no idea this
story<00:04:59.810> was<00:04:59.990> going<00:05:00.140> to<00:05:00.290> go<00:05:00.440> where<00:05:00.680> it<00:05:00.830> went<00:05:01.040> and

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
story was going to go where it went and

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.090 
story was going to go where it went and
it<00:05:01.490> completely<00:05:01.850> surprised<00:05:02.390> me<00:05:02.630> and<00:05:02.950> kind<00:05:03.950> of

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
it completely surprised me and kind of

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.860 
it completely surprised me and kind of
broke<00:05:04.340> my<00:05:04.520> heart<00:05:04.670> a<00:05:04.820> little<00:05:04.910> bit<00:05:05.060> in<00:05:05.450> the<00:05:05.630> end<00:05:05.780> I

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
broke my heart a little bit in the end I

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.480 
broke my heart a little bit in the end I
gave<00:05:06.020> this<00:05:06.140> book<00:05:06.290> a<00:05:06.350> 4<00:05:06.620> out<00:05:06.680> of<00:05:06.860> 5<00:05:07.040> stars<00:05:07.310> I

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
gave this book a 4 out of 5 stars I

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:08.800 
gave this book a 4 out of 5 stars I
really<00:05:07.520> enjoyed<00:05:08.030> it<00:05:08.180> I<00:05:08.270> wouldn't<00:05:08.510> say<00:05:08.630> it<00:05:08.750> was

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
really enjoyed it I wouldn't say it was

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.750 
really enjoyed it I wouldn't say it was
a<00:05:08.870> perfect<00:05:09.080> book<00:05:09.440> I<00:05:09.650> would<00:05:10.010> have<00:05:10.130> liked<00:05:10.580> it<00:05:10.700> to

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
a perfect book I would have liked it to

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.850 
a perfect book I would have liked it to
be<00:05:10.880> maybe<00:05:11.240> a<00:05:11.360> little<00:05:11.660> bit<00:05:11.780> longer<00:05:12.020> I<00:05:12.290> feel<00:05:12.620> like

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
be maybe a little bit longer I feel like

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.130 
be maybe a little bit longer I feel like
the<00:05:13.010> story<00:05:13.250> does<00:05:13.850> seem<00:05:14.180> a<00:05:14.210> little<00:05:14.420> bit<00:05:14.690> rushed

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
the story does seem a little bit rushed

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.740 
the story does seem a little bit rushed
I<00:05:15.380> think<00:05:15.680> especially<00:05:15.830> because<00:05:16.190> she<00:05:17.030> covers<00:05:17.630> so

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
I think especially because she covers so

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.180 
I think especially because she covers so
many<00:05:17.930> different<00:05:18.200> characters<00:05:18.320> or<00:05:18.830> even<00:05:19.100> if

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
many different characters or even if

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.100 
many different characters or even if
there<00:05:19.310> were<00:05:19.460> just<00:05:20.000> like<00:05:20.150> another<00:05:20.390> 50<00:05:20.780> pages

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
there were just like another 50 pages

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.230 
there were just like another 50 pages
added<00:05:21.260> to<00:05:21.470> this<00:05:21.620> book<00:05:21.830> so<00:05:22.100> that<00:05:22.310> the<00:05:22.670> world<00:05:23.060> was

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
added to this book so that the world was

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.520 
added to this book so that the world was
expanded<00:05:23.720> a<00:05:23.750> little<00:05:23.810> bit<00:05:23.960> more<00:05:24.200> and<00:05:24.320> there<00:05:24.440> was

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
expanded a little bit more and there was

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:25.810 
expanded a little bit more and there was
a<00:05:24.560> little<00:05:24.800> bit<00:05:24.890> more<00:05:25.010> development<00:05:25.490> I<00:05:25.610> would

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
a little bit more development I would

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.520 
a little bit more development I would
have<00:05:25.910> really<00:05:26.120> liked<00:05:26.330> that<00:05:26.360> but<00:05:26.900> but<00:05:27.110> at<00:05:27.410> the

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
have really liked that but but at the

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.740 
have really liked that but but at the
same<00:05:27.710> time<00:05:28.040> I<00:05:28.070> feel<00:05:28.430> like<00:05:28.700> the<00:05:29.210> way<00:05:29.390> things

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
same time I feel like the way things

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.070 
same time I feel like the way things
went<00:05:30.080> feels<00:05:30.560> very<00:05:30.860> real<00:05:31.280> so<00:05:31.910> I<00:05:32.450> didn't

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
went feels very real so I didn't

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.930 
went feels very real so I didn't
completely<00:05:33.740> discredit<00:05:34.430> the<00:05:34.550> book<00:05:34.700> for<00:05:34.880> that

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
completely discredit the book for that

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.450 
completely discredit the book for that
aspect<00:05:35.600> obviously<00:05:35.900> but<00:05:36.590> I<00:05:36.860> wouldn't<00:05:37.340> have

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
aspect obviously but I wouldn't have

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.190 
aspect obviously but I wouldn't have
minded<00:05:37.670> if<00:05:37.970> that<00:05:38.120> had<00:05:38.270> happened<00:05:38.450> either<00:05:38.840> I

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
minded if that had happened either I

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.360 
minded if that had happened either I
definitely<00:05:39.620> recommend<00:05:39.860> this<00:05:40.040> book<00:05:40.190> to<00:05:40.340> people
