00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.610
 hello everyone with you spoon and today we 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.050
 We will consider here using 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.510
 which you can add to the game 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.820
 as many as three new items let's 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.440
 see the first item 1 item 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.539
 called coal block using 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.340
 which you can swim the whole stack 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.340
 any ore with just one 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.310
 Such a unit is shorter than its fuel 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.690
 many even longer than that of a bucket of lava Well 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.640
 and we will proceed to the next block 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.739
 the next block is called redstone block 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.160
 and its feature is that we can 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.500
 spend 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.690
 redstone signal as scenery that is 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.360
 Now we let the signal put the torch 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.310
 and connect the unit it will glow it 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.470
 makes light well and also if we connect 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:47.170
 to him another block then he too will 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.150
 glow and also give a signal in 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.060
 Generally cool feature I think 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.649
 but we will proceed to the next block 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.140
 the next block is called the wheat block 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.420
 Well, on another there and you can not translate 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.370
 there is now you can see everything of course 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.420
 still called as a wheat block here 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.520
 see weblog 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.770
 and its feature is that we can 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.079
 use it as a haystack that is 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.200
 just as a decoration but also if we 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:11.680
 add a pumpkin to it like this and if we 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.860
 add 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.750
 then soon if they come to us 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.150
 any other animals 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.510
 now we make a pumpkin and a 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.909
 look what we got on her 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.220
 spinning around its axis that is, it doesn't 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.990
 moves just spinning and feature 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.119
 her in that she overtakes everyones 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.850
 creatures that is if we drive now 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.729
 here the cow then she runs away see she 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.939

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:46.479
