00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
I think so I mean they've got they've

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.120 
I think so I mean they've got they've
got<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.540> wealth<00:00:09.780> of<00:00:09.929> experience<00:00:10.050> but<00:00:10.800> so<00:00:10.950> have

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
got a wealth of experience but so have

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.820 
got a wealth of experience but so have
sk<00:00:11.550> they've<00:00:11.820> been<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.179> several<00:00:13.139> lan<00:00:13.440> events

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
sk they've been to several lan events

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.460 
sk they've been to several lan events
now<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.309> i<00:00:14.670> really<00:00:15.150> think<00:00:15.960> they're<00:00:16.139> in<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.320> good

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
now and i really think they're in a good

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.980 
now and i really think they're in a good
position<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:17.039> take<00:00:17.310> this<00:00:17.510> yeah<00:00:18.510> they<00:00:18.840> are

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
position to take this yeah they are

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.040 
position to take this yeah they are
indeed<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:19.710> match<00:00:20.490> point<00:00:20.910> then<00:00:21.119> for<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.810> team

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
indeed so match point then for the team

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.140 
indeed so match point then for the team
of<00:00:22.230> sk<00:00:22.710> this<00:00:22.920> will<00:00:23.039> put<00:00:23.160> them<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.519> kneel<00:00:23.880> and

they've already beaten pandemic who are
leading<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.760> group<00:00:26.910> at<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.150> moment<00:00:27.539> when

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
leading the group at the moment when

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.540 
leading the group at the moment when
leavin<00:00:28.170> versus<00:00:28.470> got<00:00:28.680> game<00:00:28.980> east<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.460> that

leavin versus got game east and that

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.830 
leavin versus got game east and that
would<00:00:29.640> be<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.760> great<00:00:30.060> game<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.390> watch<00:00:30.510> as<00:00:30.689> it's

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
anyway that's a follow-up then from the

anyway that's a follow-up then from the
start<00:00:35.880> we're<00:00:36.300> going<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.480> follow<00:00:36.600> paper<00:00:36.930> cat

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
start we're going to follow paper cat

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.319 
start we're going to follow paper cat
he's<00:00:37.890> going<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.219> want<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.460> get<00:00:38.640> on<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:39.090> another

he's going to want to get on to another

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.970 
he's going to want to get on to another
they<00:00:39.600> don't<00:00:39.780> want<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.050> jump<00:00:40.469> another<00:00:40.770> at<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
they don't want to jump another at the

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.860 
they don't want to jump another at the
same<00:00:41.160> time<00:00:41.430> because<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.850> put<00:00:42.180> both<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.390> them<00:00:42.690> in

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
same time because I put both of them in

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.750 
same time because I put both of them in
a<00:00:42.989> nova<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.590> rightfully<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.129> they<00:00:44.520> don't

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
a nova and rightfully so they don't

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.670 
a nova and rightfully so they don't
inflame<00:00:45.300> jumps<00:00:45.629> another<00:00:45.809> he<00:00:46.020> gets<00:00:46.200> no<00:00:46.379> but<00:00:46.590> an

inflame jumps another he gets no but an

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.430 
inflame jumps another he gets no but an
income<00:00:46.980> zom<00:00:47.219> on<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.520> back<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.700> him<00:00:47.910> flame<00:00:48.149> and

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
income zom on the back of him flame and

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.420 
income zom on the back of him flame and
straightaway<00:00:49.440> inflamed<00:00:49.800> he's<00:00:50.010> gonna<00:00:50.100> have<00:00:50.280> to

straightaway inflamed he's gonna have to

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.549 
straightaway inflamed he's gonna have to
drop<00:00:50.700> down<00:00:51.079> looking<00:00:52.079> now<00:00:52.199> he's<00:00:52.410> playing

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
drop down looking now he's playing

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.799 
drop down looking now he's playing
defensive<00:00:53.219> finally<00:00:53.579> goes<00:00:53.969> into<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> battle

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
defensive finally goes into a battle

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.270 
defensive finally goes into a battle
stance<00:00:55.050> probably<00:00:55.379> got<00:00:55.500> an<00:00:55.590> over<00:00:55.829> power<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.160> a

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
stance probably got an over power of a

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.910 
stance probably got an over power of a
double<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.760> well<00:00:57.719> going<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.260> work<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:58.649> Psalm

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
double and well going to work on Psalm

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.520 
double and well going to work on Psalm
so<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.160> looks<00:00:59.309> like<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.750> DPS<00:01:00.750> team<00:01:01.050> Mele

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
so it looks like the DPS team Mele

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.900 
so it looks like the DPS team Mele
dpsing<00:01:01.980> aren't<00:01:02.280> going<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.489> go<00:01:02.579> on<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.760> back<00:01:02.879> of

dpsing aren't going to go on the back of

dpsing aren't going to go on the back of
his<00:01:03.120> aam<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.629> dom<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:05.790> evasion

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
his aam so dom is a evasion

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.609 
his aam so dom is a evasion
he's<00:01:06.479> only<00:01:06.600> going<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.840> have<00:01:06.990> one<00:01:07.229> there<00:01:07.470> was<00:01:07.590> a

he's only going to have one there was a

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.850 
he's only going to have one there was a
poly<00:01:08.340> onto<00:01:08.970> paper<00:01:09.780> cap<00:01:10.080> he<00:01:10.380> when<00:01:10.560> he's<00:01:10.680> out<00:01:10.830> of

poly onto paper cap he when he's out of
this<00:01:11.100> hopefully<00:01:11.790> his<00:01:11.970> damage<00:01:12.299> will<00:01:12.450> be<00:01:12.479> much

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
this hopefully his damage will be much

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.660 
this hopefully his damage will be much
greater<00:01:13.320> we<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.619> see<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> power<00:01:13.950> infusion<00:01:14.490> on

greater we can see a power infusion on

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.429 
greater we can see a power infusion on
to<00:01:14.880> another<00:01:15.119> but<00:01:15.659> really<00:01:15.960> didn't<00:01:16.200> pull<00:01:16.320> out

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
to another but really didn't pull out

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.899 
to another but really didn't pull out
much<00:01:16.680> damage<00:01:17.070> whatsoever<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.580> here<00:01:17.700> we<00:01:17.790> come

he's actually in shield on one hand for
some<00:01:22.320> reason<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:22.920> does<00:01:23.159> actually<00:01:23.280> affect

some reason so that does actually affect

some reason so that does actually affect
the<00:01:23.790> damage<00:01:24.119> but<00:01:24.240> still<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.600> forces<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.200> nice

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
the damage but still it forces a nice
