 but correct the results of tournament four 

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:16.460
 continents then of course in some 

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:18.920
 discharges they were quite unexpected 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.240
 For example, the victories of the stain start giving 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.459
 but the unexpected was not even that 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:27.170

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:27.920
 scott moir couldn't roll properly 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.579
 free dance 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.579
 because of some unexpected 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:33.579
 unexplained 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.849

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.480
 times when they filmed 3 slots of their places 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:26.220
 was on tournament 4 continent the year 2030 and 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.739
 almost 9 years have passed since that 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.310
 they are again three girls on a pedestal 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.310

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:40.980

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:20.540
