00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.940
 in the introduction to this song 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:51.310
 It sounds like this intro 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:55.210
 [music] 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:01:00.940
 let's see each board separately 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:06.520
 each one screamed the first chord em 9 then 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:08.880
 There is a minor but on court here so he 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.880
 is played 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.460
 but you are 6 open fifth string here 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.380
 skip on the fourth string 4 fret 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.250
 third string open 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.590
 second string 3 fret which will 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.750
 go to the second and the first string 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:32.450
 do not play anything in the right hand we play 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:39.580
 bust in this way that is, we play 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:39.580
 6 4 3 2 then 4 2 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:47.270
 and now let's pay attention to this 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.270
 change that is played 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:02:00.270
 and then put your finger 1 on 2 this one 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.270
 finger that was on the third fret removed 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.270
 world 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:14.160
 but 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:18.960
 [music] 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.520
 so the next chord is played 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:29.319
 seem to be 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:29.319
 [music] 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:36.570
 look but you really are all here 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.880
 very simple all we need to hold 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:44.610
 it is only on the sixth string on the 3rd fret 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:47.240
 note salt all other notes open then 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:51.240
 there is this note of quarrel clamped 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:54.630
 the rest of the strings we play brute force 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.620
 played sixth and new york and third 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.720
 second open then then repeat 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.950
 million blow and on the third string here 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.330
 only later 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:09.300
 add to the bullet mouth and it sounds like this 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:11.810
 [music] 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.370
 right hand 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.370
 [music] 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.800
 6 4 3 2 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.380
 something third 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:28.540
 and the last chord 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:31.190
 [music] 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:36.050
 last feed we have to play 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:40.040
 collection and this and with sus they are understated 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.720
 a quart to play it all is necessary 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.430
 first put on the accord and then 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.430
 start typing it using arpeggio 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.750
 let's dwell on how it is played 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:04:03.550
 the chord itself in the second fret we do not play 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:04:03.550
 bars first index finger up 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:16.550
 on the second fret of the barn mmo-games first 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:20.000
 index finger so the 6th 

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:24.250
 string 2 fret 5 string 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.360
 4 fret 4 string is our barium 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:30.870
 second fret third string 4 fret and 2 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.580
 the first string in the second year and 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.710
 typed chord in the right hand here 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.880
 so together at the same time we take 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.960
 finger on 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.860
 and with your finger and the sixth first string then 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:48.970
 finger on 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:53.110
 play fifth then finger and fourth 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:57.510
 finger the third finger the second and 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.510
 returning the third 4 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.710
 [music] 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.810
 and the last note we play is 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.830
 finger on we play fifth string yet 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.060
 time let's do it all slowly 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.060
 [music] 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:17.750
 nothing more slow 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:19.730
 [music] 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.810
 and the last chord that we play is 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:25.960
 chord F sharp major seventh chord 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.760
 we play it just ordinary arpeggios 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:32.120
 starting from 6 0 1 side 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:37.220
 the first string is played on the sixth 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:40.340
 string second fret on 5 string view 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:43.880
 department on the second fret generally take the bar 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:49.970
 like we had last sixth chord 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:56.120
 string 2 fret 5 4 4 4 fret the third string 3 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:59.780
 fret and 2 1 strings second fret on board 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:02.030
 the usual F-sharp to not plant again 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.200
 chord we just need to remove 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.200
 fourth finger 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:13.000
 so that on the fourth string we had 4 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.890
 lata on 2 of our defense 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.840
 these are the chords in our introduction 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.740
 let's play all retreat again 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:26.029
 from the beginning to the end 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:26.029
