00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello everyone with you shrimp and today 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.379
 we will consider just awesome mod because 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.840
 adds this mod to the most minkravt 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.049
 real dragons that by the way 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.240
 can become your best friends well 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.300
 Okay, let's consider what 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.400
 for dragons add this mod but in front 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.800
 that i would like to quickly show you 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.990
 one single croft of this mod 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.300
 let's open the workbench and out the window 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.269
 crafting workbench put the most ordinary 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.250
 bait and crude porcine and 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.890
 absolutely no matter how you arrange 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.170
 these items on the workbench and as you can see 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.030
 we got this fishing rod with 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.790
 meat which is further to us 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.170
 useful so that we can 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.870
 manage the dragon but about this i am you 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.730
 I'll tell you a little later, but what ashcraft I give you 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.309
 showed now let's probably 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.530
 sleep the dragon itself and we sleep 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.660
 it can in two ways the first way 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.120
 is find a portal to the world 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.760
 go there kill the dragon pick up 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.920
 him a dragon egg and then put it 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.500
 somewhere in a place where there is heat 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.479
 Well, for example, near glory, well, and then 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.580
 just wait for hatches 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.549
 little dragon what really 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.920
 very long well and the second way is the most 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.320
 light I could certainly take advantage 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.780
 first method but he as you understood very 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.210
 and very long okay second method 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.369
 The following is taken from the creative 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.350
 fashion is such an egg and just 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.380
 just somewhere remember our 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.780
 dragon well for example here and voila 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.060
 as you can see we have such a sleep here 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.340
 here's a wonderful red dragon 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.520
 In order to tame it you will need 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.980
 fish most usually raw fish do not know 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.130
 why but dragons do not like fried 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.120
 bu raw and only raw okay hope you 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.190
 it is remembered 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.890
 well now let me show you how 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.560
 can i change my dragon first 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.080
 There are five kinds of dragons in total. 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.810
 water dragon emerald fire 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.270
 ice and gold well and for example in me 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.760
 like red fire dragons you 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.220
 would like some other well 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.560
 for example watermark why not for 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.510
 of this you need being close to your 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.080
 dragon open chat and write 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.940
 the following command slush dragon nonsense here 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.270
 but also after that press on the keyboard 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.640
 Enter key and as you can see our dragon 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.400
 changed dramatically on water and this on 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.350
 actually pretty cool Well Now 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.630
 let's try our water 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.580
 dragon change to emerald for 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.130
 open chat click the arrow 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.680
 up erase the words here and what is translated 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.990
 from English means water and write 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.340
 word m is a role that of course translates 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.800
 like an emerald 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.130
 press enter and what we see is our 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.140
 water dragon has become emerald 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.480
 amazing so inside the dragon we are with you 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.510
 reviewed this fiery water 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.940
 emerald next dragon is golden 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.459
 all doing exactly the same open chat and 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.880
 instead of the last word and the world we write 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.310
 gold press enter and success is our dragon 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.790
 turned gold and it's really great 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.310
 well, the very last dragon is ice 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.470
 now just instead of the word hum we need 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.320
 insert words a of obvious 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.989
 translated as ice well and as you can see our 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.239
 the dragon really became icy and 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.610
 after we reviewed all five 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.920
 kinds of dragons let's change 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.420
 our ice dragon on water 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.150
 just because I'm so strong 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.250
 like exactly water dragon 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.380
 well now let me show you how 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.840
 still on this dragon you can fly 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.720
 for this you need the most common 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.060
 saddle take it in hand hover over 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.970
 of our dragon we press the right button 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.790
 mouse and as you can see on our dragon 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.060
 appeared saddle again click on the right 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.670
 mouse button and we are already sitting 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.099
 our dragon is really 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.959
 great well and now in order for our 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:57.080
 the dragon took off we need to press 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:59.630
 the English r key is like this but for 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.420
 to make the dragon sink a little lower 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.880
 we need to press the English f key 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.130
 wonderful but for those who are not comfortable 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.500
 control the dragon by pressing the keys 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.780
 can use this fishing rod 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.630
 with meat that you remember we are with you 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.790
 still in the beginning just take 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.639
 the bait in hand and move the cursor to 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.769
 the place where you want to fly and even 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.290
 the most interesting is probably the most 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.570
 mysterious in these dragons that's what 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.090
 to the dark they glow quite brightly 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.270
 not the dragon itself shines more 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.070
 their horns are back wings and tail well then 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.710
 it seems told you everything about these 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.290
 beautiful dragons hope this mod 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.350
 you like it and you just like it

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.000
 it would be cool to know which dragon you are 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.280
 I liked the most necessary 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.919
 write your answer in the comments but 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.910
 Note that you can only choose one 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.919
 dragon 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.830
 it could be fire water 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:00.169
 Emerald ice or gold to me personally 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.419
 for example, I liked water 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.940
 dragon just because of this dragon 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:07.789
