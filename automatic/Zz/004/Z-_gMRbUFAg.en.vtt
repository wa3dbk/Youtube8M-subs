you can see kinda on the inside there
you<00:01:10.049> can<00:01:10.170> see<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.409> CPU<00:01:10.710> fan<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:12.270> orange<00:01:13.189> line

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
you can see the CPU fan the orange line

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.760 
you can see the CPU fan the orange line
you<00:01:14.430> can<00:01:14.580> see<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.119> grille<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:16.409> PCI

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
you can see in the grille is the PCI

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.990 
you can see in the grille is the PCI
Express<00:01:17.189> x16<00:01:17.729> slot<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:19.140> if<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.710> can<00:01:19.890> maybe<00:01:20.700> tell

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
Express x16 slot and if I can maybe tell

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.490 
Express x16 slot and if I can maybe tell
you<00:01:21.090> below<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.450> looks<00:01:21.630> maybe<00:01:21.810> like<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.140> PCI

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
you below it looks maybe like a PCI

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.789 
you below it looks maybe like a PCI
Express<00:01:22.590> x1<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.970> 2<00:01:24.750> PCI<00:01:25.520> slots<00:01:27.530> also<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.650> can

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
Express x1 and 2 PCI slots also you can

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.700 
Express x1 and 2 PCI slots also you can
maybe<00:01:29.189> see<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.640> glare<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.970> CMOS<00:01:30.420> battery

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
maybe see the glare of the CMOS battery

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.120 
maybe see the glare of the CMOS battery
behind<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.979> PCI<00:01:32.310> Express<00:01:32.479> x1<00:01:33.619> right<00:01:34.619> about

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
behind the PCI Express x1 right about

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.780 
behind the PCI Express x1 right about
there<00:01:36.530> and<00:01:37.530> now<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.710> side<00:01:37.979> panel<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.460> coming

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
there and now the side panel is coming

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.819 
there and now the side panel is coming
off<00:01:39.650> so<00:01:40.650> there<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:40.979> go<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:42.259> never<00:01:43.259> did<00:01:43.649> any

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
off so there you go I never did any

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.340 
off so there you go I never did any
cable<00:01:44.340> management<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.090> computer<00:01:45.479> all<00:01:46.290> I

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
cable management on this computer all I

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.440 
cable management on this computer all I
did<00:01:46.590> was<00:01:46.770> take<00:01:47.189> everything<00:01:47.610> out<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:47.939> slap<00:01:48.299> it

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
did was take everything out and slap it

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.910 
did was take everything out and slap it
back<00:01:48.689> together<00:01:48.840> after<00:01:49.229> cleaning<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.799> and

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
back together after cleaning it and

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.990 
back together after cleaning it and
putting<00:01:50.729> thermal<00:01:51.060> paste<00:01:51.240> on<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:52.729> try<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.790> lean

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
putting thermal paste on it try to lean

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.429 
putting thermal paste on it try to lean
it<00:01:54.240> up<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.720> get<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> little<00:01:54.960> bit<00:01:55.110> more<00:01:55.290> than

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
it up and get a little bit more than
