00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.000 
this is the 2014 atomic automatic and

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:20.929 
this is the 2014 atomic automatic and
definitely<00:00:12.000> my<00:00:12.150> favorite<00:00:12.540> ski<00:00:19.670> resort<00:00:20.670> scheme

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
definitely my favorite ski resort scheme

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.730 
definitely my favorite ski resort scheme
is<00:00:21.090> sort<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.330> like<00:00:21.449> training<00:00:21.779> for<00:00:22.199> me<00:00:22.410> for

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
is sort of like training for me for

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.609 
is sort of like training for me for
anywhere<00:00:23.550> else<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.939> go<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.660> really<00:00:25.080> like

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
anywhere else I go and I really like

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.620 
anywhere else I go and I really like
skiing<00:00:25.949> around<00:00:26.220> on<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.490> same<00:00:26.730> ski<00:00:27.119> for<00:00:27.449> most

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
skiing around on the same ski for most

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.529 
skiing around on the same ski for most
of<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.869> year

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:32.539 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:34.930 

the<00:00:33.289> automatics<00:00:33.769> we've<00:00:34.219> had<00:00:34.429> for<00:00:34.670> a<00:00:34.699> couple

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
the automatics we've had for a couple

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.720 
the automatics we've had for a couple
years<00:00:35.269> and<00:00:35.539> this<00:00:35.719> year<00:00:36.039> we<00:00:37.039> did<00:00:37.250> make<00:00:37.460> one

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
years and this year we did make one

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.149 
years and this year we did make one
internal<00:00:38.449> change<00:00:38.899> as<00:00:39.170> well<00:00:39.320> as<00:00:39.530> the<00:00:39.559> graphic

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:40.159 
internal change as well as the graphic

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:42.910 
internal change as well as the graphic
change<00:00:40.489> and<00:00:40.960> that's<00:00:41.960> making<00:00:42.469> it<00:00:42.649> slightly

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
change and that's making it slightly

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.880 
change and that's making it slightly
stiffer<00:00:43.519> so<00:00:44.329> the<00:00:44.899> tip<00:00:45.079> and<00:00:45.170> the<00:00:45.260> tail<00:00:45.469> have

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
stiffer so the tip and the tail have

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.660 
stiffer so the tip and the tail have
about<00:00:46.219> 15<00:00:46.670> percent<00:00:46.820> stiffer<00:00:48.309> quality<00:00:49.309> to<00:00:49.519> them

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
about 15 percent stiffer quality to them

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.939 
about 15 percent stiffer quality to them
so<00:00:49.940> they<00:00:50.059> still<00:00:50.329> are<00:00:50.600> resilient<00:00:51.110> and<00:00:51.440> playful

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
so they still are resilient and playful

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:53.560 
so they still are resilient and playful
but<00:00:52.190> it<00:00:52.339> just<00:00:52.519> has<00:00:52.640> a<00:00:52.670> little<00:00:52.940> bit<00:00:53.149> more<00:00:53.360> meat

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
but it just has a little bit more meat

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.660 
but it just has a little bit more meat
to<00:00:53.600> it<00:00:53.960> especially<00:00:54.409> for<00:00:54.739> that<00:00:54.890> like<00:00:55.129> high

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
to it especially for that like high

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.340 
to it especially for that like high
speed<00:00:55.729> charging<00:00:56.659> through<00:00:56.869> the<00:00:56.930> rough<00:00:57.140> terrain

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
speed charging through the rough terrain

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.299 
speed charging through the rough terrain
now<00:00:58.100> I'm<00:00:58.250> out<00:00:58.549> mine<00:00:58.789> at<00:00:59.089> +3<00:00:59.899> so<00:01:00.739> that's<00:01:01.039> 3

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
now I'm out mine at +3 so that's 3

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.099 
now I'm out mine at +3 so that's 3
centimeters<00:01:01.879> above<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:02.269> factory

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:03.109 
centimeters above the factory

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.370 
centimeters above the factory
recommendation<00:01:04.449> +3<00:01:05.449> puts<00:01:05.720> me<00:01:05.899> in<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.020> center

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
recommendation +3 puts me in the center

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.490 
recommendation +3 puts me in the center
of<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:06.830> sidecut<00:01:07.340> center<00:01:08.060> of<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:08.659> basically

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
of the sidecut center of the basically

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.889 
of the sidecut center of the basically
the<00:01:09.619> camber<00:01:10.069> underfoot<00:01:10.759> as<00:01:11.149> well<00:01:11.330> being<00:01:11.840> a

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
the camber underfoot as well being a

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:13.930 
the camber underfoot as well being a
little<00:01:12.110> more<00:01:12.229> forward<00:01:12.560> makes<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:13.009> ski<00:01:13.280> have<00:01:13.909> a

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
little more forward makes the ski have a

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.609 
little more forward makes the ski have a
more<00:01:14.149> even<00:01:14.330> swing<00:01:14.810> weight<00:01:14.990> and<00:01:15.200> be<00:01:15.319> a<00:01:15.350> little

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
more even swing weight and be a little

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.370 
more even swing weight and be a little
more<00:01:15.740> balanced<00:01:16.159> and<00:01:16.460> so<00:01:17.090> it<00:01:17.210> also<00:01:17.390> provides<00:01:18.200> me

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
more balanced and so it also provides me

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.090 
more balanced and so it also provides me
a<00:01:18.409> little<00:01:18.799> more<00:01:18.950> tail<00:01:19.340> as<00:01:19.729> well<00:01:20.560> what<00:01:21.560> I<00:01:21.590> really

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
a little more tail as well what I really

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.760 
a little more tail as well what I really
like<00:01:22.310> is<00:01:22.580> that<00:01:22.789> it's<00:01:23.420> got<00:01:23.600> a<00:01:23.659> big<00:01:24.020> rocker<00:01:24.350> tip

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
like is that it's got a big rocker tip

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.609 
like is that it's got a big rocker tip
the<00:01:25.039> powder<00:01:25.280> rocker<00:01:25.700> so<00:01:26.240> really<00:01:27.020> planes<00:01:27.350> well

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
the powder rocker so really planes well

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.460 
the powder rocker so really planes well
on<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:27.920> tip<00:01:28.159> underfoot<00:01:29.179> we<00:01:29.420> have<00:01:29.539> camber<00:01:30.140> for

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
on the tip underfoot we have camber for

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.289 
on the tip underfoot we have camber for
quite<00:01:30.709> a<00:01:30.740> ways<00:01:31.009> and<00:01:31.310> then<00:01:31.429> in<00:01:31.549> the<00:01:31.670> tail<00:01:31.909> just<00:01:32.209> a

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
quite a ways and then in the tail just a

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:33.969 
quite a ways and then in the tail just a
little<00:01:32.630> bit<00:01:32.750> of<00:01:32.840> rocker<00:01:33.049> so<00:01:33.440> you<00:01:33.500> still<00:01:33.799> have<00:01:33.950> a

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
little bit of rocker so you still have a

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.639 
little bit of rocker so you still have a
pivotable<00:01:34.520> really<00:01:35.360> maneuverable<00:01:35.869> ski<00:01:36.350> and

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
pivotable really maneuverable ski and

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.830 
pivotable really maneuverable ski and
with<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.099> core<00:01:37.399> thickness<00:01:38.330> being<00:01:38.629> a<00:01:38.690> more

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
with the core thickness being a more

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.940 
with the core thickness being a more
beefy<00:01:39.289> it<00:01:39.709> just<00:01:39.950> added<00:01:40.310> to<00:01:40.550> its<00:01:40.759> stability

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
beefy it just added to its stability

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.200 
beefy it just added to its stability
it's<00:01:43.950> pretty<00:01:44.220> much<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.400> perfect<00:01:44.729> length

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
it's pretty much the perfect length

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.380 
it's pretty much the perfect length
what's<00:01:45.840> great<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.530> comes<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.390> 193

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
what's great is that it comes in a 193

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.620 
what's great is that it comes in a 193
so<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.290> for<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> larger<00:01:50.520> person<00:01:50.820> someone

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
so that for a larger person someone

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.150 
so that for a larger person someone
who's<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:51.960> little<00:01:52.200> heavier<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.590> little<00:01:52.890> taller

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
who's a little heavier a little taller

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.190 
who's a little heavier a little taller
and<00:01:53.550> it<00:01:53.940> provides<00:01:54.300> the<00:01:54.540> same<00:01:54.780> kind<00:01:55.110> of

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
and it provides the same kind of

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.680 
and it provides the same kind of
stability<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:56.100> balance<00:01:56.280> ski<00:01:56.940> for<00:01:57.300> someone<00:01:57.570> a

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
stability and balance ski for someone a

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.780 
stability and balance ski for someone a
little<00:01:57.930> bit<00:01:58.020> bigger<00:01:58.200> it's<00:01:59.010> still<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.310> light

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
little bit bigger it's still a light

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.170 
little bit bigger it's still a light
nimble<00:02:00.360> ski<00:02:00.690> for<00:02:01.020> me<00:02:01.050> but<00:02:01.530> has<00:02:01.920> what<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:02.910> need
