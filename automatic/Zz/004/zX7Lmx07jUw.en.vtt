00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.400
 a lot more flying flight and low shots 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.869
 it's good you've already taken that I believe 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.010
 but it's pope earth alat and these amber 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.290
 so yeah said I'm waiting for you so 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.090
 that 's what you want to cross 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.009
 and after london where he gave who had me 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.490
 well human comes to cramoisy more 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:28.710
 stop 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:29.880
 yes alas arrived at cramoisy you come back 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.630
 in the lab on the left 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.159
 you talk to him who tells you that it's 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.619
 an important doctor that he examines 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:42.060
 fossils and he already takes you the 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.670
 first fossil is close to zero in 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.290
 down right after you so there he tells you 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.540
 that we have to wait a moment so with 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.670
 the the fossil dome so be it to do 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.439
 one that will make a nice grain so that's 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.880
 it is better to wait a moment down 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.210
 it's simple you come back you take it out 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.920
 market 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.659
 and there you talk about it and he tells you he 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.100
 did a case rather so now 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.290
 you have a buteau case it's beautiful 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.259
 and will you make me go speak a 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.179
 second time and there what he wants 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.959
 do you have a fossil for me yes 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:16.349
 you give it the amber fossil there you 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.129
 says that's it's a fossil of 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.080
 tera 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:23.459
 so here you redo the technique on 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.590
 go back we go out little elite 11 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.810
 we go back and there you will see in my 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.230
 team or a team of 5 to become a 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.810
 shot a team of 6 monterrat took over the 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.720
 life and I was a little terra beautiful 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.140
 so there we could see I put my case 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.629
 butcher behind that is a little ugly and 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.849
 I commend my frozen ground in case 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:48.140
 earlier so that you and see what 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:50.160
 point he is Belgian and Asia comes 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.980
 to give up everything as we do 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.000
 expect hop 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:04.709

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.069
 how beautiful it is my case goals to 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.540
 talks about your questions you're 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.550
 change what to munich conquer the 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.480
 all past but your ammonites to see at 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.040
 what does the time look like so I'm going 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.340
 continue fast makes this bonus video 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.470
 to show you the relationship with the 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:29.010
 land you fly here at fouchy in city 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:32.549
 you're flying here you're riding 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.170
 points and time and this condition 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.340
 it is necessary to see 50 pokemon caught 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.500
 different so this debate is you in 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.330
 catch 50 different or sow does the 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.129
 technique you trade pokemon that 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.290
 you have not with friends and then you 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:45.780
 give it back after that it's good 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:51.000
 Faster arrived here you step 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:54.030
 this floor you have a teacher a 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.670
 next wizard and what's 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.980
 tells you that there has to be something 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.220
 have 50 different pokemon be caught 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.650
 have the multi xp so there it gives you 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.930
 the multi xp and that of course you go 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.040
 put on I think like me opera 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.209
 captera is a pokemon and we are going to say who 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.980
 as soon as it reaches we'll say a loan on 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.470
 level 30 becomes very powerful because 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.209
 that he is the bird and stone and cuba this 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.660
 that hurts the bones and lapierre and then 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.360
 bah here in translation 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:27.380
 and and that as we have it we only have it 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.150
 level-5 so it's quite problematic 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.140
 So we will put the multics peace for 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:37.250
 climb faster and all is well so the 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:40.670
 time I will join buzzer equal 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:43.150

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.910
 in town hall but a common ground that have 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.070

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:31.280
 go up to level 50 that way 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.370
 multics peace or in the normal xp just 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:37.580
 for a reason it's level 50 teras 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:42.800
 what is he learning he is learning ultra 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:43.700

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.120
 learn level 50 you learn it like 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.190
