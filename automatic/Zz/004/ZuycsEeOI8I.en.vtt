00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.610 
smell is very strong just go ahead and
try<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.909> see<00:01:30.150> what<00:01:30.270> it's<00:01:30.390> about

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.240 

it's<00:01:36.520> not<00:01:36.670> bad<00:01:36.970> I<00:01:37.420> don't<00:01:38.050> get<00:01:38.200> a<00:01:38.230> burn<00:01:38.440> from<00:01:38.740> it

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.680 

but<00:01:42.250> I<00:01:42.310> definitely<00:01:42.580> get<00:01:42.850> that<00:01:42.910> citrus<00:01:43.480> taste

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
but I definitely get that citrus taste

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.710 
but I definitely get that citrus taste
to<00:01:43.990> it<00:01:45.330> um<00:01:46.800> actually<00:01:47.800> like<00:01:48.250> it<00:01:48.460> I<00:01:48.670> can't<00:01:49.540> really

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
to it um actually like it I can't really

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.080 
to it um actually like it I can't really
think<00:01:49.960> of<00:01:50.140> that<00:01:50.680> much<00:01:50.920> I<00:01:51.130> can<00:01:51.160> really<00:01:51.310> mix<00:01:51.790> with

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
think of that much I can really mix with

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.910 
think of that much I can really mix with
it<00:01:52.270> but<00:01:52.480> I<00:01:52.510> guess<00:01:52.780> people<00:01:52.870> who<00:01:53.170> like<00:01:53.380> citrus

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
it but I guess people who like citrus

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.470 
it but I guess people who like citrus
probably<00:01:54.310> know<00:01:54.430> exactly<00:01:54.910> what<00:01:55.030> they<00:01:55.120> can<00:01:55.300> mix

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
probably know exactly what they can mix

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.630 
probably know exactly what they can mix
with<00:01:55.570> it<00:01:55.870> cool<00:01:56.530> thing<00:01:56.740> about<00:01:56.860> it<00:01:57.130> is<00:01:57.340> it

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
with it cool thing about it is it

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.160 
with it cool thing about it is it
definitely<00:01:58.090> it's<00:01:58.210> one<00:01:58.390> of<00:01:58.480> those<00:01:58.570> drinks<00:01:58.900> that

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
definitely it's one of those drinks that

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.600 
definitely it's one of those drinks that
you<00:01:59.350> can<00:01:59.470> probably<00:01:59.770> just<00:01:59.920> garnish<00:02:00.400> it<00:02:00.580> with

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
you can probably just garnish it with

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.540 
you can probably just garnish it with
one<00:02:01.030> thing<00:02:01.360> I'll<00:02:01.840> actually<00:02:02.530> just<00:02:02.830> add<00:02:03.040> one

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
one thing I'll actually just add one

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.250 
one thing I'll actually just add one
thing<00:02:03.610> to<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:04.300> you<00:02:04.390> actually<00:02:04.570> got<00:02:04.810> a<00:02:04.870> great

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
thing to and you actually got a great

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.620 
thing to and you actually got a great
tasting<00:02:05.680> drink<00:02:06.010> I<00:02:06.250> pretty<00:02:06.880> much<00:02:07.000> think<00:02:07.390> hey

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
tasting drink I pretty much think hey

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.820
