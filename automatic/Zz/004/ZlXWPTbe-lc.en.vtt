00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
automatically downloads new drivers

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.750 
automatically downloads new drivers
because<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:01.020> don't<00:01:01.260> know<00:01:01.489> like<00:01:02.489> for<00:01:02.699> example

with my graphics card i downloaded a new
driver<00:01:05.339> for<00:01:05.580> my<00:01:05.670> graphics<00:01:06.000> card<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.540> other

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
driver for my graphics card the other

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.840 
driver for my graphics card the other
day<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.770> blue<00:01:07.950> screen<00:01:08.220> my<00:01:08.340> computer<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.790> i

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
day and it blue screen my computer and i

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.460 
day and it blue screen my computer and i
can<00:01:09.000> turn<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.270> back<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:09.420> i<00:01:09.570> had<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.960> roll<00:01:10.260> back

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
can turn it back on i had to roll back

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.070 
can turn it back on i had to roll back
so<00:01:11.070> i<00:01:11.369> don't<00:01:11.850> want<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.090> be<00:01:12.119> able<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.450> have<00:01:13.049> it

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
so i don't want to be able to have it

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.510 
so i don't want to be able to have it
automatically<00:01:13.560> do<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.130> when<00:01:14.250> i<00:01:14.280> turn<00:01:14.490> on

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
automatically do that so when i turn on

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.490 
automatically do that so when i turn on
my<00:01:14.670> computer<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:15.180> can't<00:01:15.450> use<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.720> anymore<00:01:15.750> it's

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
my computer I can't use it anymore it's

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.580 
my computer I can't use it anymore it's
just<00:01:16.710> them<00:01:16.920> it'd<00:01:17.280> just<00:01:17.520> be<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.729> big<00:01:17.909> hassle<00:01:18.119> so

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
just them it'd just be a big hassle so

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.280 
just them it'd just be a big hassle so
what<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.619> suggest<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:20.840> well<00:01:21.840> show<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.110> what<00:01:22.229> I'm

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
same like for my modem speedtouch 330s

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.640 
same like for my modem speedtouch 330s
is<00:03:12.349> not<00:03:12.530> up<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.769> date<00:03:14.079> so<00:03:15.079> i<00:03:15.109> just<00:03:15.319> got<00:03:15.470> the

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650

speed touch or the thompson website i

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:18.610 
speed touch or the thompson website i
think<00:03:17.419> i<00:03:17.449> have<00:03:17.510> to<00:03:17.690> do<00:03:17.750> for<00:03:17.870> this<00:03:17.989> one<00:03:18.169> or<00:03:18.379> just

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
think i have to do for this one or just

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.819 
think i have to do for this one or just
to<00:03:18.859> put<00:03:19.489> it<00:03:19.609> in<00:03:19.760> google<00:03:20.569> and<00:03:20.660> i<00:03:21.169> put<00:03:21.440> driver<00:03:21.680> on

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
to put it in google and i put driver on

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.339 
to put it in google and i put driver on
the<00:03:21.949> end<00:03:22.040> so<00:03:22.389> you<00:03:23.389> don't<00:03:23.599> really<00:03:23.900> have<00:03:24.290> to

the end so you don't really have to

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.890 
the end so you don't really have to
worry<00:03:24.500> about<00:03:25.209> downloading<00:03:26.209> a<00:03:26.419> pretty<00:03:26.810> rare

minutes<00:03:31.430> that<00:03:31.849> you<00:03:31.879> have<00:03:32.269> new<00:03:32.900> drivers

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
minutes that you have new drivers

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:34.960

going to need to update them that much i

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.170 
going to need to update them that much i
mean<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.680> most<00:03:36.829> important<00:03:37.400> is<00:03:37.579> probably<00:03:38.000> the

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
mean the most important is probably the

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
graphics card and that's only if you're

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.219 
graphics card and that's only if you're
a<00:03:39.859> gamer<00:03:40.159> and<00:03:40.750> just<00:03:41.750> so<00:03:41.840> you<00:03:41.870> can<00:03:42.019> play<00:03:42.199> the

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
latest games but I mean to be honest I

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.030

don't<00:03:44.419> even<00:03:44.599> need<00:03:44.870> to<00:03:45.049> upgrade<00:03:45.349> my<00:03:45.590> modem

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
don't even need to upgrade my modem

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.949

because<00:03:46.220> it<00:03:46.340> works<00:03:46.549> and<00:03:46.909> my<00:03:47.209> sound<00:03:47.510> where<00:03:47.780> some

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959
