00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
stabilization so let's go ahead and take

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:04.550 
stabilization so let's go ahead and take
a<00:03:59.939> walk<00:04:00.299> to<00:04:00.689> see<00:04:01.469> how<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:01.879> shake<00:04:03.349> comes<00:04:04.349> out

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
a walk to see how the shake comes out

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
I'm not doing anything special try and

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.309

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
hold it any steadier than I normally

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.270
