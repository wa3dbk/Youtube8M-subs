00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
the bottom you can access their switches

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.340 
the bottom you can access their switches
on<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.520> left<00:01:23.729> hand<00:01:23.939> we've<00:01:24.509> got<00:01:24.720> five<00:01:24.960> sets<00:01:25.259> of

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
on the left hand we've got five sets of

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.980 
on the left hand we've got five sets of
reeds<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.909> six<00:01:26.909> switches<00:01:27.299> our<00:01:27.450> first<00:01:27.689> one<00:01:27.869> is

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
reeds and six switches our first one is

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.810 
reeds and six switches our first one is
a<00:01:28.020> tuba<00:01:28.409> bass<00:01:30.979> so<00:01:31.979> that's<00:01:32.189> just<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.579> lowest

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
a tuba bass so that's just the lowest

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.149 
a tuba bass so that's just the lowest
read<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:34.020> cuts<00:01:34.229> out<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.470> chord<00:01:34.829> so<00:01:35.130> you

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
read and it cuts out the chord so you

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.240 
read and it cuts out the chord so you
would<00:01:35.340> use<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.880> emulate<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.329> tuba<00:01:36.750> sound

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
would use that to emulate a tuba sound

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.890 
would use that to emulate a tuba sound
next<00:01:38.250> one<00:01:40.250> and<00:01:41.250> that's<00:01:41.670> more<00:01:41.850> like<00:01:42.030> her

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
next one and that's more like her

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.400 
next one and that's more like her
these<00:01:44.900> are<00:01:45.050> both<00:01:45.320> kind<00:01:45.560> of<00:01:45.650> baseball<00:01:47.350> sounds<00:01:48.350> a

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
these are both kind of baseball sounds a

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.750 
these are both kind of baseball sounds a
little<00:01:48.620> fuller<00:01:48.860> on<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.160> chords<00:01:49.490> then<00:01:49.610> we've

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
little fuller on the chords then we've

00:01:49.760 --> 00:02:00.130
