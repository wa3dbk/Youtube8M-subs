00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.570
 good and now let's paint marion 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.420
 they dress in arm that wants of about 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.429
 hearts and well then let's do it 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.369
 then first let's make a 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.369
 little pink heart in this part 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.760
 we make a little heart in pink color 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.950
 next thing we're going to do is also 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.950
 a strong color is a green color 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.930
 we 're going to do it here 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.160
 and a third heart in purple 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.770
 here 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.879
 in this part 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.940
 and good look here are his three 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.920
 hearts and nothing else what we have left 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.200
 to do is let's delineate it with our 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.280
 create the number three let's delineate 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.280
 what color black 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.520
 and with this same brush we're going to turn it off 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.890
 and we're going to paint a white line on it 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.460
 the center of the heart so that it gives light 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.360
 to them 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.360
 here like this 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.810
 now with our brush number 6 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.370
 let's load it with white paint to 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.500
 do what the filters are but let's 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.360
 first to our brush in the hand and 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.400
 is what I do because sometimes it has 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.870
 enough water excess water and runs 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.850
 then here in Lima I do not know where I 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.680
 I try it first and that's fine 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.680
 then I start doing my filters 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:42.640
 here 3 here in this part 2 and we do 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.640
 another 2 on this side 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.110
 and here in this part we are going to make you 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.110
 a few dots to give him enhance 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.430
 we are all on three sides and longer 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.930
 nothing else in this part we're going to make you 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.930

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.930
 good and here we have finished the 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.300
 completely design look how nice 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.180
