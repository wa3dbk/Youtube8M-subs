over your maps and yeah we head back up
there<00:01:18.590> what<00:01:19.590> we<00:01:19.860> did<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.189> like<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.640> said<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.909> had

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
there what we did I like I said I had

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.270 
there what we did I like I said I had
mentioned<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.110> other<00:01:22.140> video<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.680> myself

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
mentioned in the other video that myself

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.190 
mentioned in the other video that myself
in<00:01:23.549> my<00:01:23.640> snatch<00:01:24.180> had<00:01:24.390> actually<00:01:24.869> drove<00:01:25.049> around

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
in my snatch had actually drove around

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.730 
in my snatch had actually drove around
and<00:01:25.439> tested<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:27.170> movie<00:01:28.170> map<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.710> we

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
and tested the movie map so we

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.950 
and tested the movie map so we
definitely<00:01:29.400> will<00:01:29.549> have<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.939> attached<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.750> a

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
definitely will have that attached in a

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.350 
definitely will have that attached in a
second<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.610> so<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.700> guys<00:01:32.790> can<00:01:33.000> check<00:01:33.030> that

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
second and so you guys can check that

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.609 
second and so you guys can check that
out<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.570> see<00:01:33.720> how<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.900> maps<00:01:34.200> actually

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
out and see how the maps actually

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.219 
out and see how the maps actually
function<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.549> real<00:01:35.909> life<00:01:36.119> setting<00:01:36.540> but

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
function in the real life setting but

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.200 
function in the real life setting but
it's<00:01:37.470> very<00:01:37.950> easy<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.310> use<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.820> can<00:01:39.060> actually

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
it's very easy to use I can actually

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.380 
it's very easy to use I can actually
just<00:01:39.780> pop<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.350> say<00:01:40.590> drive<00:01:41.189> there<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.670> once

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
just pop in to say drive there and once

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.700 
just pop in to say drive there and once
you<00:01:42.479> get<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.630> drive<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:43.079> can<00:01:43.200> actually<00:01:43.350> just

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
you get to drive you can actually just

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.010 
you get to drive you can actually just
select<00:01:44.149> where<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.210> want<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.479> go<00:01:45.570> drive<00:01:45.840> home

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
select where you want to go drive home

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.240 
select where you want to go drive home
which<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.259> probably<00:01:46.619> preset<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.130> save

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
which is probably preset and save

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.100 
which is probably preset and save
instead<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.790> destination<00:01:48.299> look<00:01:48.509> for<00:01:48.659> one<00:01:48.810> so

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
instead of destination look for one so

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.889 
instead of destination look for one so
we<00:01:49.710> definitely<00:01:49.890> will<00:01:50.220> check<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.430> out<00:01:50.700> and

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
we definitely will check that out and

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.139 
we definitely will check that out and
see<00:01:51.899> how<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.229> Obi<00:01:52.770> match<00:01:52.979> work<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.610> your<00:01:53.939> life

okay it's on our routes and it's Sousou
navigation<00:03:00.110> of<00:03:01.110> course<00:03:01.349> is<00:03:01.530> telling<00:03:01.920> us<00:03:02.010> right

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
navigation of course is telling us right

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.979 
navigation of course is telling us right
now<00:03:02.370> we're<00:03:02.549> going<00:03:02.700> he<00:03:02.909> named<00:03:03.150> wrong<00:03:03.510> direction

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
now we're going he named wrong direction

so<00:03:04.470> let's<00:03:04.830> see<00:03:04.980> if<00:03:05.040> it<00:03:05.190> recalculates<00:03:05.519> okay

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
so let's see if it recalculates okay

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.380 
so let's see if it recalculates okay
it's<00:03:06.209> doing<00:03:06.450> that<00:03:06.510> right<00:03:06.659> now

able to get the voice trapped by turn
directions<00:03:22.480> on<00:03:22.840> here<00:03:23.370> but<00:03:24.370> it<00:03:25.239> works<00:03:25.480> people

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
directions on here but it works people

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.860 
directions on here but it works people
as<00:03:25.930> a<00:03:25.959> navigation<00:03:26.620> you<00:03:27.550> know<00:03:27.720> give<00:03:28.720> you

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
as a navigation you know give you

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.040 
as a navigation you know give you
directions<00:03:29.230> sure<00:03:30.069> you<00:03:30.400> speed<00:03:30.880> distance<00:03:31.780> to

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
directions sure you speed distance to

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.710 
directions sure you speed distance to
the<00:03:32.319> external<00:03:32.680> points<00:03:33.310> all<00:03:34.239> that<00:03:34.450> kind<00:03:34.630> of<00:03:34.660> fun

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
the external points all that kind of fun

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.350 
the external points all that kind of fun
stuff<00:03:34.900> so<00:03:38.400> yeah<00:03:39.400> I'm<00:03:39.760> going<00:03:39.940> to<00:03:40.030> be<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.209> voice

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.119 
stuff so yeah I'm going to be the voice
turn-by-turn<00:03:40.810> directions<00:03:41.170> does<00:03:41.769> it<00:03:41.890> seems

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:42.129 
turn-by-turn directions does it seems

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.720 
turn-by-turn directions does it seems
like<00:03:43.500> it<00:03:44.500> doesn't<00:03:44.650> have<00:03:44.980> one<00:03:45.250> from<00:03:45.459> the<00:03:45.610> old

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.559 
like it doesn't have one from the old
maps<00:03:46.120> but<00:03:46.690> it<00:03:46.840> works<00:03:47.580> at<00:03:48.580> least<00:03:48.790> you<00:03:49.030> have<00:03:49.209> maps

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569
