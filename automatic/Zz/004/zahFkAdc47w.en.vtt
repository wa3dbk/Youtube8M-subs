has<00:01:47.360> been<00:01:47.390> away<00:01:47.750> there's<00:01:48.320> done<00:01:48.440> pretty<00:01:48.620> well

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
has been away there's done pretty well

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.640 
has been away there's done pretty well
because<00:01:49.010> the<00:01:49.220> tracks<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:49.520> beginner<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:51.140> noid

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
because the tracks the beginner the noid

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.110 
because the tracks the beginner the noid
racing<00:01:52.070> is<00:01:52.160> sometimes<00:01:52.610> depending<00:01:52.970> if<00:01:53.030> the

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
racing is sometimes depending if the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.820 
racing is sometimes depending if the
winds<00:01:53.360> up<00:01:53.510> we<00:01:53.630> might<00:01:53.810> have<00:01:53.930> a<00:01:53.960> head<00:01:54.530> instead<00:01:54.740> of

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
winds up we might have a head instead of

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.260 
winds up we might have a head instead of
having<00:01:55.010> a<00:01:55.100> thirty<00:01:55.280> second<00:01:55.670> gap<00:01:55.820> it<00:01:55.970> might<00:01:56.120> be<00:01:56.240> a

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
having a thirty second gap it might be a

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.900 
having a thirty second gap it might be a
minute<00:01:56.540> or<00:01:56.600> two<00:01:56.810> minutes<00:01:56.930> and<00:01:57.670> still<00:01:58.670> run<00:01:58.880> on

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
minute or two minutes and still run on

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.700 
minute or two minutes and still run on
time<00:01:59.210> so<00:01:59.570> hopefully<00:01:59.990> you<00:02:00.080> can<00:02:00.140> push<00:02:00.380> up<00:02:00.500> in<00:02:00.620> the

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
time so hopefully you can push up in the

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.550 
time so hopefully you can push up in the
dust<00:02:00.890> a<00:02:01.010> little<00:02:01.100> bit<00:02:01.370> and<00:02:01.610> at<00:02:02.390> some<00:02:02.630> point<00:02:02.870> if

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
dust a little bit and at some point if

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.290 
dust a little bit and at some point if
the<00:02:04.100> transition<00:02:04.490> works<00:02:04.760> out<00:02:04.970> you<00:02:05.060> actually

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
the transition works out you actually

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.720 
the transition works out you actually
get<00:02:05.450> to<00:02:05.600> start<00:02:06.080> in<00:02:06.230> front<00:02:06.470> and<00:02:07.220> stay<00:02:07.400> out<00:02:07.550> of<00:02:07.580> it

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
get to start in front and stay out of it

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.460 
get to start in front and stay out of it
but<00:02:07.909> some<00:02:08.330> of<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.509> corners<00:02:08.869> when<00:02:09.349> they're

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
but some of the corners when they're

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.930 
but some of the corners when they're
actually<00:02:09.590> bob<00:02:09.890> bob<00:02:10.159> doubt<00:02:10.399> and<00:02:10.610> everyone's

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
actually bob bob doubt and everyone's

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.640 
actually bob bob doubt and everyone's
going<00:02:11.090> through<00:02:11.360> them<00:02:11.510> hopefully<00:02:12.170> you<00:02:12.440> get<00:02:12.530> it

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
going through them hopefully you get it

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.990 
going through them hopefully you get it
right<00:02:12.800> and<00:02:13.010> remember<00:02:13.370> from<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:13.610> last<00:02:13.730> time
