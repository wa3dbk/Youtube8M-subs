00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.779
 it would seem how much you can test 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.210
 SUVs 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.669
 but they are all almost the same but 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.480
 when we got into the hands of this instance we 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:17.300
 could not resist generously tm 140 most 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.440
 large all-terrain vehicle in Russia 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.189
 today we can manage 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.189
 this technique 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.120
 I do not understand feel behind the wheel 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:37.940
 BTR or driving the aircraft to the end 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.940
 click on the gas let go and now 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.410
 take away 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.720
 here you can really say 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:01.110
 food where I want as the country 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.150
 to manage such a block is easy enough 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.780
 the only thing best that she goes 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.850
 just right if you turn it 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.619
 you need to separately prepare for this 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.460
 slow down now for example 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:17.470
 rotate 90 degrees 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.470
 second gear and until it stops 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.670
 maximum speed here is 50 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.360
 kilometers an hour after with that gear 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.740
 but we are us 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.740
 on these roads I will not. 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.020
 Originally, the cheater was built on the basis of 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.570
 bmp 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.899
 here in principle and still remain 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.360
 the nodes are the same steering wheel the same caterpillars 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.659
 and also passable only thing 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.640
 most importantly changed the interior and added or 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.920
 manual transmission actually 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.159
 This is the Russian version of the robotic 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.350
 here are the mechanics of the buttons in this 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.420
 super informative screen is much easier 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.189
 see your reflection here is 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.659
 huge amount of any toggle switches and 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.509
 buttons especially striking 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.580
 gvp button maybe this is an emergency 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.319
 challenge to the president of the russian federation on 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.130
 actually an abbreviation of transcripts as 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.959
 water pump 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.750
 since this car is still able 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.970
 float on the river in case of a button click 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.950
 pumps pump out water if she suddenly 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.349
 horrible car we decided to find out 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.519
 expert opinion all-terrain vehicle at the present 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.790
 off road fan 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:33.750
 before you serious core technology 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:37.319
 bretheren she bmp and started this 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.719
 tracked tractor tracked tractor 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.340
 there is something to compare so let's see it 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:43.340
 but let's test 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.640
 shook 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.090
 boltology 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.780
 No for Russia on the grass passed if 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.610
 closing 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.660
 insulation will be almost like 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.660
 was looking for cars 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.930
 this is missing 250 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.069
 Horse power 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.590
 at 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.590
 and 12 own thin 4 tons 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.470
 driver 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:41.920
 guard and like immediately trail 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.170
 that is, my passion for dothrake, he does not 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.160
 fit and becoming like a technical is not 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.160
 spend the night good cross 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.710
 good handling but compared to 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.360
 a jeep as if with a car after all 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.780
 he loses maneuverability only from 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.940
 technicals but quite reached 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.280
 the only thing that of course is fuel consumption 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.370
 very big after all a liter per kilometer 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.190
 Ie 100 kilometers then its liters 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.440
 cost where did not forget to add that on 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.670
 tracked vehicles can not go on 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.780
 public roads 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.780
 Well, good luck to you on the roads 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.350
 the steeper the jeep, the farther to go for 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.040
 tractor this all-terrain vehicle will get you out 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.040
 any quagmire 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.900
 suffered
