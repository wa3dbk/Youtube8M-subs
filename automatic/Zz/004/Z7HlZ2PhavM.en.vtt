00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.820
 on fast cooking 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.219
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.920
 make ice cream malabar very 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.929
 greedy it's gone for this recipe 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.310
 it will take us 40 centilitres of 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.160
 whole liquid cream 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.859
 he will also need a pot of 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:28.769
 therefore concentrated sugar milk is this 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:31.760
 tax which weighs 3 197 g 10 malabar and 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.760
 pink dye 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:39.870
 I just unpacked so my little ones 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:44.250
 malabar here I prepared in that of 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:47.760
 ice cream molds I take a chewing gum 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.489
 with the knife and the goal it's going to be 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.730
 make an incision so in the center of 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.730
 bruiser 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:02.460
 once it's done we just insert 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.769
 so the tip of the boat ice then 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.869
 we go there gently if ever 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.920
 chewing gum breaks it's not serious 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.970
 can always stick to them and there the goal 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.659
 it's really to drag it 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.280
 to the bottom so if we see that here it 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.220
 stuck that we take a knife 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.180
 delicately and oracle that's how 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:29.310
 create a small passage and push 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.320
 so until the end is here once 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.299
 did that we have it all on one 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.030
 plate and direction the freezer 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.560
 for about ten minutes 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.479
 so with the rest I will come here 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.189
 cut them into small pieces 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.920
 while take a chisel if you 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:48.060
 want to cut them directly 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:55.500
 when I'm in the pan 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:02:02.310
 so I put the liquid cream and I 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:04.060
 bring everything to a boil with the whisk 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.050
 I make sure it does not fly 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.239
 then I have but malabar in the 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.790
 cream 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:19.180
 I mix right I'll go 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:22.810
 temperature and then I cut so the 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.810
 fire so I remove my pans and I 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.340
 let it infuse for 10 minutes 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.860
 it's important that the little piece of 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.630
 choice in itself well melted so do not hesitate 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.750
 not to put your pan back 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:38.049
 at very low temperatures and to mix 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.940
 so that everything is well hanged then 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.450
 I will pour my condensed milk 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.819
 sugar 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.280
 so do not put in 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.920
 heat sweetened condensed milk with the 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.690
 cream there you have eight chances out of ten 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.209
 to burn your preparation 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.220
 then we do not have to 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.769
 put me I'm going to put the three 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.980
 cards at first then I 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:03.760
 and if it will taste sugar is enough 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:09.220
 I will not put the rest I mix 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:12.480
 as it should not be said that it smells 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.480
 very very good the malabar 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:19.680
 so now I'm going to taste I think 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.940
 we can put everything 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.060
 so if you do not have too many 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.880
 sweet desserts in this case there you 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.150
 manage according to your tastes 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.630
 then we all then mixed 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.630
 properly 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:39.810
 now we will put another 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.379
 blow pink laurent so I would put 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:52.980
 little initially and I will control so 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:56.160
 the dosage there I think that's enough I'm going 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:01.430
 so use this color I spend my 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:08.160
 sieve mixture I pour my preparation 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:10.110
 in the spout and then I'm going 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.480
 fill so but small footprint 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.440
 so the ice cream molds I bought 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.690
 months on the internet 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.519
 but otherwise in all stores 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.000
 specialized in the utensils of 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.840
 cooking you easily find them 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.840
 so I fill them 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.389
 with this preparation you go 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:39.089
 can do about this ice 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:41.159
 so there I have a little bit left then 

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:44.520
 I did not fulfill them first because 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:46.740
 than with the chewing gum that I put on 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.110
 the tip of the ice and that would risk 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:54.300
 to overflow 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:56.849
 so here I close the stick and then 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.129
 so I put it all in the freezer 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:02.419
 about four hours but the day before 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:02.419
 for the next day it's always better 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:10.830
 so that's it chilled me are ready 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:13.499
 here I prepared so a container with 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.659
 hot water and I'm going soaked 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:19.669
 so the soft ice a few seconds 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:19.669
 to facilitate demolding 

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:33.229
 so I'm so soft ice cream and 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:33.229
 is going to unmold it so delicately 

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:42.300
 so I show you that my ice cream 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.559
 Malabar nearly there I can tell you that 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.939
 I only want to go 

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:49.620
 immediately at the tasting 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:52.680
 we have a very good taste of malabar a 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.449
 real ice texture and in the end we have 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.289
 the chewing gum that awaits us at the end 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:57.089
 ice 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:59.129
 I really hope you have tested 

00:05:57.089 --> 00:06:02.099
