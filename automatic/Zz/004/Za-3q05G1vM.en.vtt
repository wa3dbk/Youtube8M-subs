 "Annoying villagers" review 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.600
 You killed your brother 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.000
 And for this, you have to... 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.380
 dancing 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.700
 No, please! Don't let me do that kind of thing! 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.990
 You heard him! Dancing to the king 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.310
 (cry) 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.380
 I hate dancing! 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.340
呃~ 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.140
 Oh, it’s not right. 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.040
 "Annoying villagers" review 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.440
 I think they are gone. 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.880
 Let's get some dirt and leave here! 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.480
 Ok 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.640
 It seems that you are surrounded 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.560
 Destroy him 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.820
 just now 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.100
 catch him 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.940
 Hey, look at the villagers. 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.880
 where! 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.420
 I can't believe you let him run. 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.460
 Oh, the owner 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.200
 Looks like these zombies, they are eager to oppose you 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.340
 They work with those annoying villagers 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.080
 Do you want me to put the minions around them? 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.780
 No, but send a message, this will correct them 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.540
 Yes Master 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.900
 Where did you run from? 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.420
 I feel terrible 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.940
 I am sorry 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.000
 But must have sacrifice 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.160
 Hey stupid zombies! Read that piece of paper 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.480
 Haha, just right 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.400
 We caught him 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.880
 Hey, where did you get the sword? (Translation: America_Noob)
