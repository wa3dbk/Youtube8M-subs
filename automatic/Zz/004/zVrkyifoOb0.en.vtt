00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.770 
make spectacular cables you want the
signal<00:02:53.610> going<00:02:53.820> into<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.180> computer<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.630> be<00:02:54.690> as

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
signal going into the computer to be as

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.720 
signal going into the computer to be as
loud<00:02:54.959> as<00:02:55.170> possible<00:02:55.200> you'd<00:02:55.890> only<00:02:56.010> sound<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.459> clip

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
loud as possible you'd only sound a clip

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.220 
loud as possible you'd only sound a clip
but<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.120> also<00:02:57.269> don't<00:02:57.540> you<00:02:57.810> don't<00:02:57.930> want<00:02:58.049> it<00:02:58.110> to

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
but you also don't you don't want it to

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.170 
but you also don't you don't want it to
be<00:02:58.290> so<00:02:58.470> low<00:02:58.709> that<00:02:58.739> you<00:02:59.070> boost<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.670> in<00:02:59.760> software

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
be so low that you boost it in software

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.789 
be so low that you boost it in software
and<00:03:00.450> then<00:03:00.570> you<00:03:00.630> have<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.780> noise<00:03:01.230> floor<00:03:01.470> that's

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
and then you have a noise floor that's

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.800 
and then you have a noise floor that's
also<00:03:02.190> boosted<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:02.910> sounds<00:03:03.269> awful<00:03:03.570> so<00:03:03.600> you

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
also boosted and it sounds awful so you

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.080 
also boosted and it sounds awful so you
want<00:03:04.080> it<00:03:04.200> as<00:03:04.459> labs<00:03:05.459> you<00:03:05.640> can<00:03:05.790> get<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.000> without

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
want it as labs you can get it without

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.240 
want it as labs you can get it without
clipping<00:03:06.450> if<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.470> look<00:03:07.620> at<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.799> screen<00:03:08.100> you

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
clipping if you look at the screen you

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.699 
clipping if you look at the screen you
can<00:03:08.370> see<00:03:08.640> it's<00:03:08.820> is<00:03:09.239> clipping<00:03:10.019> a<00:03:10.170> little<00:03:10.380> bit<00:03:10.500> so

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
can see it's is clipping a little bit so

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:11.870 
can see it's is clipping a little bit so
I<00:03:10.739> should<00:03:11.040> have<00:03:11.130> turned<00:03:11.280> this<00:03:11.459> down<00:03:11.700> before

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
I should have turned this down before

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.370 
I should have turned this down before
