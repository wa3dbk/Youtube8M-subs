00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.009 
was a big every time you when I gave me
it's<00:03:09.519> kind<00:03:09.790> of<00:03:09.819> just<00:03:09.939> why<00:03:10.329> is<00:03:10.389> it<00:03:10.599> still<00:03:10.780> doing

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
it's kind of just why is it still doing

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.509 
it's kind of just why is it still doing
this<00:03:11.109> and<00:03:11.290> so<00:03:11.409> actually<00:03:12.069> was<00:03:12.189> through<00:03:12.400> the

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
this and so actually was through the

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:13.949 
this and so actually was through the
creation<00:03:12.760> of<00:03:12.939> T<00:03:13.090> motor<00:03:13.329> that<00:03:13.480> allowed<00:03:13.720> us<00:03:13.750> to

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
creation of T motor that allowed us to

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.839 
creation of T motor that allowed us to
be<00:03:14.230> able<00:03:14.319> to<00:03:14.500> do<00:03:14.650> this<00:03:14.859> so<00:03:15.069> that<00:03:15.099> was<00:03:15.340> kind<00:03:15.819> of

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
be able to do this so that was kind of

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:17.430 
be able to do this so that was kind of
one<00:03:16.060> innovation<00:03:16.359> from<00:03:16.569> last<00:03:16.870> year<00:03:17.079> leading<00:03:17.260> to

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
one innovation from last year leading to

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.259 
one innovation from last year leading to
a<00:03:17.470> new<00:03:17.650> feature<00:03:17.889> this<00:03:18.129> year<00:03:18.370> where<00:03:18.970> you're

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
a new feature this year where you're

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.369 
a new feature this year where you're
able<00:03:19.359> to<00:03:19.540> see<00:03:19.690> that<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:19.989> so<00:03:20.049> they<00:03:20.260> will

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379 
able to see that and so they will

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.110 
able to see that and so they will
actually<00:03:20.739> dynamically<00:03:21.280> update<00:03:21.699> the<00:03:21.790> colors

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
actually dynamically update the colors

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.629 
actually dynamically update the colors
for<00:03:22.840> that<00:03:23.019> so<00:03:23.260> in<00:03:23.709> I<00:03:23.799> screenshot<00:03:24.310> you<00:03:24.459> saw

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
for that so in I screenshot you saw

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.129 
for that so in I screenshot you saw
that's<00:03:25.030> this<00:03:25.359> is<00:03:25.419> the<00:03:25.599> cool<00:03:25.780> part<00:03:25.810> right<00:03:26.109> here

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
that's this is the cool part right here

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.569 
that's this is the cool part right here
this<00:03:26.530> might<00:03:26.650> be<00:03:26.769> something<00:03:26.859> you<00:03:27.040> didn't<00:03:27.430> quite

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
this might be something you didn't quite

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.159 
this might be something you didn't quite
notice<00:03:27.970> in<00:03:28.180> that<00:03:28.359> screenshot<00:03:28.629> but<00:03:28.930> you<00:03:28.989> look

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.169 
notice in that screenshot but you look

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:30.240 
notice in that screenshot but you look
gonna<00:03:29.319> make<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:29.560> player<00:03:29.739> that<00:03:29.919> Clemson

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
gonna make the player that Clemson

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.319 
gonna make the player that Clemson
player<00:03:30.400> look<00:03:30.579> at<00:03:30.669> the<00:03:30.730> bottom<00:03:31.000> right<00:03:31.030> there

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
player look at the bottom right there

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.059 
player look at the bottom right there
it's<00:03:31.870> a<00:03:31.959> little<00:03:32.199> logo<00:03:32.530> right<00:03:32.709> there<00:03:32.739> it's

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
it's a little logo right there it's

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.099 
it's a little logo right there it's
orange<00:03:33.400> and<00:03:33.459> white<00:03:33.669> look<00:03:34.449> a<00:03:34.780> little<00:03:34.900> closer

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
orange and white look a little closer

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.259 
orange and white look a little closer
it's<00:03:35.409> hard<00:03:35.590> to<00:03:35.680> see<00:03:36.010> but<00:03:36.220> that's<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.579> SEC<00:03:36.970> logo

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
it's hard to see but that's the SEC logo

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.659 
it's hard to see but that's the SEC logo
so<00:03:37.389> that's<00:03:37.510> Clemson<00:03:37.930> in<00:03:38.109> the<00:03:38.199> SEC<00:03:38.680> and<00:03:38.949> the

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:39.669 
so that's Clemson in the SEC and the

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.729 
so that's Clemson in the SEC and the
logo<00:03:40.000> now<00:03:40.150> looks<00:03:40.419> like<00:03:40.510> if<00:03:41.049> clumps<00:03:41.379> of<00:03:41.500> warning

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
logo now looks like if clumps of warning

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.740 
logo now looks like if clumps of warning
s<00:03:41.799> you<00:03:41.919> see<00:03:42.069> the<00:03:42.220> outsize<00:03:42.699> to<00:03:42.970> be<00:03:43.060> them<00:03:43.239> yes<00:03:43.569> so

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
s you see the outsize to be them yes so

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.599 
s you see the outsize to be them yes so
basically<00:03:43.959> we<00:03:44.500> match<00:03:44.680> exactly<00:03:45.129> what<00:03:45.400> in

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
basically we match exactly what in

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:47.250 
basically we match exactly what in
theory<00:03:45.849> would<00:03:46.060> happen<00:03:46.419> to<00:03:46.659> have<00:03:46.810> a<00:03:46.900> team<00:03:47.079> moved

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
theory would happen to have a team moved

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.210 
theory would happen to have a team moved
over<00:03:47.409> you<00:03:47.530> know<00:03:47.590> we<00:03:47.680> take<00:03:47.859> kind<00:03:48.069> of<00:03:48.099> their

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
over you know we take kind of their

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.740 
over you know we take kind of their
primary<00:03:48.609> and<00:03:48.729> secondary<00:03:48.819> color<00:03:49.269> or<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.540> ones

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
primary and secondary color or the ones

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.939 
primary and secondary color or the ones
that<00:03:49.870> look<00:03:49.989> at<00:03:50.109> the<00:03:50.199> best<00:03:50.409> route<00:03:50.620> for<00:03:50.650> any

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:50.949 
that look at the best route for any

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:52.500 
that look at the best route for any
school<00:03:51.159> and<00:03:51.489> you<00:03:51.609> know<00:03:51.699> you<00:03:51.940> know<00:03:52.030> put<00:03:52.209> them<00:03:52.359> on

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
school and you know you know put them on

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.599 
school and you know you know put them on
that<00:03:52.720> logo<00:03:52.900> so<00:03:53.260> I<00:03:53.290> think<00:03:53.530> it<00:03:54.069> look<00:03:54.280> like<00:03:54.459> they

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
that logo so I think it look like they

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.159 
that logo so I think it look like they
really<00:03:54.849> moved<00:03:55.180> over<00:03:55.449> to<00:03:55.510> this<00:03:55.659> and<00:03:55.870> say<00:03:55.959> yeah

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.169 
really moved over to this and say yeah

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:57.089 
really moved over to this and say yeah
you're<00:03:56.349> not<00:03:56.470> going<00:03:56.590> to<00:03:56.650> get<00:03:56.739> just<00:03:56.979> the

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
you're not going to get just the

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:59.939 
you're not going to get just the
generics<00:03:57.669> you<00:03:58.090> know<00:03:58.150> stop<00:03:58.479> acc<00:03:59.109> as<00:03:59.440> you<00:03:59.709> see

00:03:59.939 --> 00:03:59.949 
generics you know stop acc as you see

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:02.460 
generics you know stop acc as you see
Big<00:04:00.430> Ten<00:04:00.639> whack<00:04:00.940> conference<00:04:01.900> logo<00:04:02.049> on<00:04:02.379> the

the helmet I think you know during last
year<00:04:19.400> during<00:04:19.489> gameplay<00:04:19.790> way<00:04:20.510> they<00:04:20.600> actually

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
year during gameplay way they actually

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:21.909 
year during gameplay way they actually
you<00:04:21.049> know<00:04:21.139> when<00:04:21.410> they<00:04:21.530> were<00:04:21.590> in<00:04:21.709> you<00:04:21.889> know

bowls<00:04:23.720> they<00:04:23.810> actually<00:04:24.050> showed<00:04:24.200> up<00:04:24.350> but<00:04:24.500> during

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
bowls they actually showed up but during

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.010 
bowls they actually showed up but during
actual<00:04:25.220> gameplay<00:04:25.550> which<00:04:26.120> really<00:04:26.330> was<00:04:26.570> you

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
actual gameplay which really was you

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.840 
actual gameplay which really was you
showed<00:04:27.260> off<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:27.590> worse<00:04:27.770> and<00:04:28.010> kick<00:04:28.250> off<00:04:28.400> so<00:04:28.730> the

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
showed off the worse and kick off so the
