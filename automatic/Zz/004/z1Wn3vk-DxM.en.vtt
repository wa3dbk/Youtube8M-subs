00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
this version of Windows so think past

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
Windows 95 it became a same system and

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.969 
Windows 95 it became a same system and
starts<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.840> don't<00:01:25.110> even<00:01:25.320> see<00:01:25.470> because

G to get it the same style as you get in
the<00:02:26.620> Windows<00:02:26.890> XP<00:02:27.340> version<00:02:27.780> then<00:02:28.780> what<00:02:29.020> we're

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
the Windows XP version then what we're

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.270 
the Windows XP version then what we're
going<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.350> do<00:02:29.440> is<00:02:29.560> going<00:02:29.710> to<00:02:29.770> change<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.100> drive

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
going to do is going to change the drive

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.000 
going to do is going to change the drive
see<00:02:32.520> I've<00:02:33.520> installed<00:02:33.940> it<00:02:34.450> into<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:35.710> windows

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
see I've installed it into the windows

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.890 
see I've installed it into the windows
directory<00:02:36.360> usually<00:02:37.360> this<00:02:37.480> would<00:02:37.660> start

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
directory usually this would start

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.690 
directory usually this would start
automatically<00:02:38.410> with<00:02:38.680> later<00:02:38.920> versions<00:02:39.400> but

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
automatically with later versions but

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.400 
automatically with later versions but
you<00:02:39.910> actually<00:02:40.210> have<00:02:40.360> to<00:02:40.510> physically<00:02:40.810> go<00:02:41.170> into

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
you actually have to physically go into

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.510 
you actually have to physically go into
the<00:02:41.500> directory<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:42.190> type<00:02:42.520> in<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:44.400> here<00:02:45.400> we

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
the directory and type in so here we

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
the directory and type in so here we
have<00:02:45.730> you<00:02:46.330> notice<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:48.820> start<00:02:49.150> was<00:02:49.330> a<00:02:49.360> bit

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
have you notice the the start was a bit

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.390 
have you notice the the start was a bit
mangled<00:02:50.050> but<00:02:50.320> that's<00:02:50.590> that's<00:02:50.950> no<00:02:51.190> problem

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
mangled but that's that's no problem

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.550 
mangled but that's that's no problem
this<00:02:52.270> is<00:02:52.330> gonna<00:02:52.600> ask<00:02:52.810> me<00:02:53.020> for<00:02:53.170> this<00:02:53.290> accuse

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560

can't<00:02:55.510> be<00:02:55.540> bothered<00:02:55.750> to<00:02:55.900> put<00:02:56.110> it<00:02:56.230> in<00:02:56.290> because

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
can't be bothered to put it in because

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.080 
can't be bothered to put it in because
I've<00:02:56.710> got<00:02:56.830> everything<00:02:57.040> installed<00:02:57.370> on<00:02:57.910> the

hard drive so I will just keep canceling

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:07.740 
hard drive so I will just keep canceling
this<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:01.510> eventually<00:03:05.850> nestle<00:03:06.850> let<00:03:07.090> me<00:03:07.180> do<00:03:07.300> ok

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
this and eventually nestle let me do ok

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
oh okay and this is Windows 1.0 I've

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
oh okay and this is Windows 1.0 I've
seen<00:03:14.440> several<00:03:14.710> um<00:03:15.930> several<00:03:16.930> screenshots<00:03:17.830> of

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
seen several um several screenshots of

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.979 
seen several um several screenshots of
it<00:03:18.430> but<00:03:18.670> not<00:03:18.790> actually<00:03:19.239> seen<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.570> in<00:03:19.630> action

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
it but not actually seen the in action

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.199 
it but not actually seen the in action
so<00:03:20.380> this<00:03:20.620> is<00:03:20.800> you<00:03:21.130> are<00:03:21.280> looking<00:03:21.610> at<00:03:21.820> windows

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
so this is you are looking at windows

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.840 
so this is you are looking at windows
1.0<00:03:22.950> as<00:03:23.950> you<00:03:24.130> can<00:03:24.280> see<00:03:25.260> it's<00:03:26.260> not<00:03:26.380> much<00:03:27.010> you

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
1.0 as you can see it's not much you

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.790 
1.0 as you can see it's not much you
have<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:28.000> do<00:03:28.360> out<00:03:28.570> and<00:03:28.810> s<00:03:28.959> 2<00:03:29.170> goes<00:03:29.260> to<00:03:29.320> special

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
have to do out and s 2 goes to special

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.100 
have to do out and s 2 goes to special
and<00:03:30.100> change<00:03:30.520> the<00:03:30.670> directory<00:03:30.940> I'm<00:03:31.750> gonna<00:03:31.959> go

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
and change the directory I'm gonna go

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.560 
and change the directory I'm gonna go
backwards<00:03:32.470> to<00:03:32.830> the<00:03:33.370> windows<00:03:33.820> directory<00:03:33.850> and

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
backwards to the windows directory and

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.830 
backwards to the windows directory and
it<00:03:35.290> can't<00:03:35.530> change<00:03:35.770> it<00:03:36.180> so<00:03:37.180> we're<00:03:37.420> going<00:03:37.570> to<00:03:37.720> go

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
it can't change it so we're going to go

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.780 
it can't change it so we're going to go
to<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.410> C<00:03:38.860> directory<00:03:41.250> for<00:03:42.250> some<00:03:42.430> reason<00:03:42.700> it

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
to the C directory for some reason it

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.320 
to the C directory for some reason it
won't<00:03:43.000> do<00:03:43.690> that<00:03:43.900> so<00:03:44.380> here<00:03:45.040> we<00:03:45.130> are<00:03:45.160> in<00:03:45.459> the<00:03:45.970> root

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
won't do that so here we are in the root

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.030 
won't do that so here we are in the root
of<00:03:46.480> the<00:03:46.570> drive<00:03:46.810> just<00:03:47.320> going<00:03:47.560> to<00:03:47.620> enter<00:03:47.800> into

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
of the drive just going to enter into

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.970 
of the drive just going to enter into
the<00:03:48.190> windows<00:03:48.459> directory<00:03:48.700> and<00:03:49.590> here<00:03:50.590> we<00:03:50.770> have

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
the windows directory and here we have

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.250 
the windows directory and here we have
several<00:03:51.310> files<00:03:51.640> that<00:03:52.060> are<00:03:52.150> on<00:03:52.360> the<00:03:53.850> computer

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
several files that are on the computer

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.320 
several files that are on the computer
so<00:03:57.510> we<00:03:58.510> just<00:03:58.720> start<00:03:58.989> clock<00:04:00.060> Wow

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
so we just start clock Wow

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.250 
so we just start clock Wow
isn't<00:04:01.570> that<00:04:01.750> amazing<00:04:02.020> this<00:04:02.860> is<00:04:03.600> Windows<00:04:04.600> 1.0

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
isn't that amazing this is Windows 1.0

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.110 
isn't that amazing this is Windows 1.0

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
clock as you can see it's very basic you

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.350 
clock as you can see it's very basic you
have<00:04:10.239> to<00:04:10.360> use<00:04:10.450> special<00:04:10.860> open<00:04:11.860> space<00:04:12.220> to<00:04:13.120> get

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
have to use special open space to get

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.600 
have to use special open space to get
out<00:04:13.540> of<00:04:13.660> things

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610
