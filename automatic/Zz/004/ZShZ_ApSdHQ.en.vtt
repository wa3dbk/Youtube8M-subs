00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:04.670
 the monumental farm het gagelgat this cough will become one in the coming period 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.300
 taken seriously 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.130
 in December it was announced that the foundation farm is the horse camp 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.200
 has chosen to participate in the new sbs6 television program 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.369
 most beautiful building in the Netherlands 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.869
 in the program sixteen monumental buildings compete for one 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.849
 restoration budget of one million euros 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.929
 the monumental building was built in the eighteenth century and became later 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:27.839
 expanded twice 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.469
 so quite unique it is unique because it has a certain pastel 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.530
 that broke already built on 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.449
 it would go above all from prague all elements that the opponent is the one you 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.379
 here is very nicely preserved intact and what you get with a lot of 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.339
 this farm sees that people are not going to do odd jobs plaster hottest 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:46.019
 continue 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.049
 and you can see that, but you can see that has not been done in the last eighty years 

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:52.049
 so it is all very nicely intact and that makes it special 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.460
 The Horse Camp Foundation has the farm on the birkstraat in soest in 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.930
 Purchased in 2008 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.930
 previously Hartman, who died in 2008, lived in this house 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.340
 heemskerk lucky time 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.070
 Erwin Mulder 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.140
 four people work on forty Italia 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.650
 the bet and you can no longer enter 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.250
 to be a bit odd again but kids look and he makes that one 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.370
 plan there was counted 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.460
 throughout the year 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.070
 and as your best korea 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.149
 The Netherlands is involved as a volunteer in the restoration of the Gagelgat 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.920
 he was a neighbor of hartman 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.070
 it did not come regularly 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.960
 and hard on it 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.909
 you are 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.840
 he can then better drink a drink 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.390
 We hear that reports the morning but some residents were at that time 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.070
 that could still be seen 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.720
 ok who reports the newspaper and on her editors that can for example in the 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.420
 construction 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.640
 I'm your volunteer job 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.710
 employees of the park 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.530
 and that is also our neighbors hence i could not help we see a lot of work too 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.700
 to do 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.780
 and that is appreciated 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.420
 Russia is convinced that the farm will be restored earlier 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:09.559
 this is coming out 

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:12.809
 the fixed price is once as many beautiful old buildings 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:17.419
 maintain borrowing people had never had a good name but because 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:19.859
 he eats too much you're committed 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.779
 here can the construction of temporary housing 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:27.139
 well and it is a shame that I cannot experience that is surprising 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.769
 In addition to the plan, the foundation has around seventy volunteers 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:32.960
 summoned 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.060
 to perform part of the restoration, it is mainly people who do it 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.640
 have a special bond with the horse camp such as flip 4 percent 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.419
 we have a 6 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:45.469
 had 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:48.469
 what the predicted have failed in recent years 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.799
 in the meantime it is again with the boy's name, he is 96 who came here 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.369
 this year or five 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:57.309
 that's why I miss that 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:00.899
 the old rockers and the people here are taking such great care of me 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:05.719
 that has since been the horse camp spending again by e-mail 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:10.539
 with a Moroccan contribution if it is needed with the op 

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:12.539
 and now this call is coming to an end 

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:15.629
 to help with the restoration of 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.629
 this was property we thought we were going to do it 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.199
 were allowed to go how the program will not win if a start is made with 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:24.189
 inflation 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:26.239
 but with less extensive 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.710
 plan of action is there is music in the race for the program 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.509
 we are on the one hand 

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:33.139
 on the part there are 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:37.069
 restoring a horse stable there is quite a bit against it 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.879
 building so that becomes possible in the key or that he will be fine and 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.319
 on the other hand, we are going to redecorate a portion of the outside area 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.849
 so comes from all the free orchard also comes back we go a row of trees along the 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.779
 The door shows the places where it used to be and that outside work is 

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:55.209
 where in particular have been volunteers 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.580
 He is the first one in February 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.009
 8 of the sixteen buildings nominated immediately 

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:05.230
 sbs 6 was present Tuesday afternoon to make recordings for the broadcast 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.250
 from 17 February
