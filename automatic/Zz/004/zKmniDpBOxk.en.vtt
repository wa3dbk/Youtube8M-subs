remember<00:00:20.730> because<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:21.210> think<00:00:21.270> he<00:00:21.539> gets<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.960> the

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
remember because I think he gets to the

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.970

core<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.980> person<00:00:23.519> because<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.710> believe<00:00:25.710> and

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
core of the person because I believe and

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.179 
core of the person because I believe and
I<00:00:26.070> think<00:00:26.310> we<00:00:26.430> both<00:00:26.460> agree<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.920> to<00:00:28.920> be<00:00:29.099> an

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
I think we both agree that to be an

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.189 
I think we both agree that to be an
addict<00:00:29.550> there's<00:00:29.699> something<00:00:30.240> going<00:00:30.570> on<00:00:30.720> so

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
addict there's something going on so

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.170 
addict there's something going on so
it's<00:00:31.500> not<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:32.219> don't<00:00:32.640> think<00:00:32.730> by<00:00:34.850> will<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.149> they

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
it's not I don't think by will that they

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.850 
it's not I don't think by will that they
want<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.600> do<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:36.960> but<00:00:37.260> there's<00:00:37.500> there's

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
want to do this but there's there's

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.860 
want to do this but there's there's
there's<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.370> seed<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:39.120> think<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.600> in<00:00:39.750> this

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
there's a seed and I think that in this

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.709 
there's a seed and I think that in this
particular<00:00:40.079> portrayal<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.100> man<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:42.239> he

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
particular portrayal of this man that he

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.869 
particular portrayal of this man that he
played<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.320> seed<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.800> what<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.610> problem

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
played the seed of what is the problem

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.330 
played the seed of what is the problem
and<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.300> think<00:00:45.329> from<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.860> we<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.190> audience

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
and I think from that we the audience

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.720 
and I think from that we the audience
are<00:00:47.789> very<00:00:48.030> sympathetic<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.110> there<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.410> have

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.950 

there's<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.789> lot<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:54.030> addicts<00:00:54.390> out<00:00:54.600> there<00:00:55.520> and

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
there's a lot of addicts out there and

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.860 
there's a lot of addicts out there and
it's<00:00:57.960> just<00:00:58.289> just<00:00:58.710> one<00:00:58.949> story<00:00:59.309> but<00:00:59.750> you<00:01:00.750> know

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
it's just just one story but you know

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.619 
it's just just one story but you know
they're<00:01:01.079> all<00:01:01.199> human<00:01:01.469> beings<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:02.180> it's<00:01:03.180> easier

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
they're all human beings and it's easier

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.570 
they're all human beings and it's easier
I<00:01:03.989> think<00:01:04.080> it's<00:01:04.500> easier<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.949> treat<00:01:05.159> alcoholism

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
I think it's easier to treat alcoholism

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.429 
I think it's easier to treat alcoholism
unlocking<00:01:06.330> people<00:01:06.630> away<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:07.080> know<00:01:07.170> obviously

it's a story of redemption it's a story

days<00:02:22.900> is<00:02:23.080> very<00:02:23.290> difficult<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:24.010> so<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:25.510> was<00:02:25.570> a

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
days is very difficult and so it was a

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.780 
days is very difficult and so it was a
long<00:02:25.990> road<00:02:26.290> just<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.680> get<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.430> know<00:02:27.520> and<00:02:27.700> then

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
long road just to get you know and then

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.460 
long road just to get you know and then
they<00:02:27.910> wanted<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:28.300> do<00:02:28.450> it<00:02:28.600> for<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:28.780> modest<00:02:29.170> price

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
they wanted to do it for a modest price

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.310 
they wanted to do it for a modest price
and<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.580> was<00:02:30.700> a<00:02:30.730> big<00:02:31.000> movie<00:02:31.360> where<00:02:32.080> he<00:02:32.110> crashed

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
and it was a big movie where he crashed

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.230 
and it was a big movie where he crashed
in<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.620> front<00:02:32.830> of<00:02:32.890> a<00:02:32.950> gigantic<00:02:33.910> you<00:02:34.090> know

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
in the front of a gigantic you know

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.880 
in the front of a gigantic you know
we've<00:02:34.510> made<00:02:34.540> big<00:02:34.900> movies<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.440> this<00:02:35.530> was<00:02:35.680> big

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
we've made big movies and this was big

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.070 
we've made big movies and this was big
and<00:02:36.400> so<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.120> combination<00:02:37.360> of<00:02:37.780> all<00:02:37.900> those

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
and so the combination of all those

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.660 
and so the combination of all those
elements<00:02:38.350> made<00:02:38.770> it<00:02:38.920> very<00:02:39.130> risky<00:02:39.610> and

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
elements made it very risky and

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.540 
elements made it very risky and
difficult<00:02:40.180> but<00:02:40.450> all<00:02:40.840> it<00:02:41.410> all<00:02:41.590> kind<00:02:42.130> of<00:02:42.220> came

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
difficult but all it all kind of came

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.670 
difficult but all it all kind of came
together<00:02:42.790> a<00:02:43.150> movie<00:02:43.510> about<00:02:43.600> an<00:02:43.990> airplane<00:02:44.440> crash

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
together a movie about an airplane crash

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.590

and<00:02:45.070> a<00:02:45.100> heavy<00:02:45.340> movie<00:02:45.700> can<00:02:45.850> be<00:02:45.880> tough<00:02:46.180> for<00:02:46.420> some

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
and a heavy movie can be tough for some

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.900 
and a heavy movie can be tough for some
audiences<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.800> want<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.100> see<00:02:48.220> especially<00:02:48.400> for
