00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.110
 also bought because I only actually 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.630
 still that uses apple tv and the ps3 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.860
 and yes, that's why I think biting the 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.470
 Two parts here, too 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.860

 then there is the ipad mini and yes 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.860
 I usually connect with it either 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.540
 device with the apple tv and promote music 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.160

 yes my ipad mini is at the boxes run 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.550
 here is a normal tripod so that 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.470
 was not too expensive 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.890
 I have one more here now 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.120
 floor lamp a plant here is a box 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.370
 with different drawers 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.620
 I think the 40 are alone 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.660
 show then here is one more 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.480
 drawer and desk can do that 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.350

 a mouse charging cable a hard drive us 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:40.300
 Continue as nothing special to the box 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.640

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.040

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.020
 videos right now and margins that too me 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.640

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.760
 the boxing is the cool thing about it 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.590
 here the whole individual boxes arbitrarily 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.849
 set as manual setting 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.280
 I could do that for example 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:17.530
 the front right is louder and here 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.530
 quieter at the front left or also at the rear 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.260
 right in the left side you can 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:26.229
 I arbitrarily inculcate in any case 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:32.530
