 let's make nut cookies and 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.820
 almonds the ingredients that we're going to 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.969
 need are the following 225 grams 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.769
 of wheat flour 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:20.390
 140 grams of butter at temperature 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:25.110
 atmosphere 125 grams of sugar an egg 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:28.590
 25 grams of ground nuts, ground 25 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.739
 grams of raw ground almonds half

 teaspoon of salt and an egg yolk 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:36.809
 to paint the cookies the first thing that 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.329
 we have to do is mix the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.700
 butter at room temperature 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.700
 I want sugar until it's 20 degrees 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.010
 an amount we have well integrated 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.890
 we add the egg that also has to 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.090
 be at room temperature and we beat 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.090
 until it is integrated 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.870
 once integrated the egg with mom 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.870
 sift the flour 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.270
 two 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.400
 once is my daughter go to all the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.520
 flour and we also add the almond 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.520
 milled 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.740
 the ground walnut 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.310
 and the salt 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.290
 and we beat it until it's integrated 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.149
 is well mixed let's move on to 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:34.930
 knead so with the same hands 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:36.880
 we are moving forward we have been kneading 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.520
 this way for about 5 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.659
 minutes our dough is ready so 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.230
 how are we going to put it in the 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:47.360
 refrigerator let's pick it up 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.360
 we are going to give it a little bit of shape 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.330
 and we are going to put on a film the 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.330
 let's cover 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.390
 and we're going to leave it in the refrigerator 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.670
 approximately 12 hours have already 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.770
 past 12 hours and we have removed the dough 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.110
 of the refrigerator we put in the oven 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.210
 preheated to 170 degrees with heat by 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.580
 up and down and now let's move on 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.240
 to spread the dough so to make it 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.750
 easier 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.670
 I'm going to cut the dough in half 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.610
 I'm going to put it on a vegetable paper 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.319
 sulfurized 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.579
 and with the help of a roller 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.579
 I will understand it well 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.750
 It's still a little hard as you can 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.610
 see but if you let it get more 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.910
 soft it is possible that it stays very 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.830
 stuck so it's better to do so 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.470
 once we have this part already 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.330
 extended more or less than when you have 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.470
 a thickness of half a centimeter we're going to 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.470
 stretch also the other 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.700
 once we have the most extended 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.710
 let's move on to making cookies with 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.530
 our cortapastas as for example 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.780
 these or if you have not started 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.990
 split a glass so 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.470
 we are going to pass cloth on also a 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.610
 little bit and so on until we do all the 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.560
 dough 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.480
 once we have already done a part 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.840
 I'm going to do the other part with this short 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.840
 pasta 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.909
 and now we are only going to remove the dough 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.120
 what's left is as easy as doing 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.120
 A) Yes 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.790
 once we have removed all the dough 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.830
 that was left over we have put the paper on 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.420
 a baking tray and now we're going to 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.890
 move on to paint the cookies with the yolk 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.890
 of egg with the help of a brush 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.230
 and so with all the cookies 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.239
 once they are all painted with 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.249
 snow and the preheated oven we are going to 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.139
 put it in the oven we leave it doing 

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:50.379
 70 degrees with carlos above and by 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:53.969
 down while we will continue doing 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.969
 cookies with the remaining dough 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.720
 in my case it has been 15 minutes and now 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.100
 they're ready so let's get them out 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.350
 we're going to have five minutes to go 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.360
 cool a bit and while we're going to put 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.210
 the other tray have already passed five 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.860
 minutes and we can catch the cookies the 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.940
 let's go putting in a grid for 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.940
 that they finish cooling 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.540
 We have already forgotten to do all the 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.329
 cookies and these have cooled 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.970
 cookies are ideal to take with the 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.979
 coffee and besides a delicious pint 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.320
 they have an exquisite smell and they are 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.540
