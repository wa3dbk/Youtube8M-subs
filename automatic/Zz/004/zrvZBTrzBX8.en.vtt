00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
it's like to be in the studio and that's

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.170 
it's like to be in the studio and that's

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.200 
be an interest is coming from the design
community<00:00:57.300> because<00:00:57.809> it's<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.050> way<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.230> have

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
community because it's a way to have

community because it's a way to have
conversations<00:01:00.210> about<00:01:00.300> how<00:01:00.510> we're<00:01:00.719> training

conversations about how we're training

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.410 
conversations about how we're training
the<00:01:01.140> next<00:01:01.230> generation<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.739> architects<00:01:02.420> but

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
the next generation of architects but

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.590 
the next generation of architects but
you<00:01:04.019> know<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.970> terminology<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
you know the terminology and the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.300 
you know the terminology and the
conversation<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.409> film<00:01:07.650> can<00:01:07.979> be<00:01:08.010> viewed

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
conversation in the film can be viewed

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.719 
conversation in the film can be viewed
by<00:01:08.520> non<00:01:08.700> architects<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:11.010> goal<00:01:11.310> for<00:01:11.640> this

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
by non architects so the goal for this

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.850 
by non architects so the goal for this
film<00:01:12.030> beyond<00:01:12.510> having<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.110> conversation<00:01:13.439> of

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
film beyond having this conversation of

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.580 
film beyond having this conversation of
how<00:01:14.070> we<00:01:14.460> train<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.939> next<00:01:15.000> generation<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.689> also

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
how we train the next generation is also

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.820 
how we train the next generation is also
to<00:01:17.030> eventually<00:01:18.030> have<00:01:18.060> an<00:01:18.720> educational<00:01:19.350> sort

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
to eventually have an educational sort

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.560 
to eventually have an educational sort
of<00:01:19.890> package<00:01:20.130> put<00:01:20.640> together<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.180> high

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
of package put together so that high

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.390 
of package put together so that high
school<00:01:21.750> students<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.350> watch<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.830> short

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
school students can watch this short

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.039 
school students can watch this short
film<00:01:23.520> or<00:01:23.850> pieces<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.420> short<00:01:24.600> film<00:01:24.750> and

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
have conversations about what what is it

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.240 
have conversations about what what is it
like<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.900> study<00:01:28.049> architecture<00:01:28.229> what<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.130> the

like to study architecture what is the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.800 
like to study architecture what is the
profession<00:01:29.729> like<00:01:29.880> what<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.270> sort<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.600> take

profession like what is it sort of take

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.140 
profession like what is it sort of take
to<00:01:30.960> be<00:01:31.110> studying<00:01:31.920> architecture<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:33.030> know

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
to be studying architecture and you know

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.130 
to be studying architecture and you know
is<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.509> something<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.810> might<00:01:34.049> be

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
is this something that might be

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.690 
is this something that might be
interested<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.799> way<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.189> architects

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
interested in the way that architects

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.609 
interested in the way that architects
are<00:01:35.820> learning<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.360> how<00:01:36.960> they<00:01:37.140> work<00:01:37.380> in

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
are learning and how they work in

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.289 
are learning and how they work in
society<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.220> changing<00:01:38.250> because<00:01:38.880> society

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
society is changing because society

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.819 
society is changing because society
needs<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.540> different<00:01:39.720> type<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.049> architect<00:01:40.619> I

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
needs a different type of architect I

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.170 
needs a different type of architect I
think<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.340> value<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.729> being<00:01:41.939> able<00:01:42.090> to

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
think that the value is being able to

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.109 
think that the value is being able to

issues<00:02:10.119> and<00:02:10.869> you<00:02:11.800> know<00:02:11.890> i<00:02:11.950> don't<00:02:12.040> i<00:02:12.250> don't<00:02:12.310> know

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
issues and you know i don't i don't know

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.550 
issues and you know i don't i don't know
if<00:02:12.610> we're<00:02:12.790> doing<00:02:12.910> that<00:02:13.090> right<00:02:13.390> now<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:14.440> that

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
if we're doing that right now and that

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.200 
if we're doing that right now and that
takes<00:02:14.740> a<00:02:14.890> different<00:02:15.070> type<00:02:15.340> of<00:02:15.370> architect<00:02:15.940> then

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
takes a different type of architect then

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.910 
takes a different type of architect then
i<00:02:16.570> think<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:16.930> what<00:02:17.200> we've<00:02:17.320> been<00:02:17.440> training<00:02:17.740> in

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
i think that what we've been training in

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.180 
i think that what we've been training in
the<00:02:18.100> sort<00:02:18.340> of<00:02:18.370> star<00:02:18.760> model
