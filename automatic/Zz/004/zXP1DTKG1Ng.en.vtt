00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
time I also see my adrenaline goes up a

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.540 
time I also see my adrenaline goes up a
lot<00:01:28.300> higher<00:01:28.600> and<00:01:28.869> faster<00:01:29.080> than<00:01:29.590> when<00:01:30.430> you're

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
lot higher and faster than when you're

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.980

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
in the ring and you're more controlled
