00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.740 
clear as well as the fact that it's just
a<00:01:37.799> lot<00:01:37.920> stronger<00:01:38.280> than<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.700> old<00:01:38.850> ap<00:01:39.270> item<00:01:39.600> in

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
a lot stronger than the old ap item in

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.899 
a lot stronger than the old ap item in
my<00:01:39.930> opinion<00:01:40.350> since<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.100> gives<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> lot<00:01:41.850> more

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
my opinion since it gives you a lot more

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.550 
my opinion since it gives you a lot more
sustained<00:01:42.810> damage<00:01:43.470> overall<00:01:45.259> champions<00:01:46.259> like

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
sustained damage overall champions like

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.740 
sustained damage overall champions like
Diana<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.250> echo<00:01:47.610> are<00:01:47.820> going<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.180> be<00:01:48.299> huge<00:01:48.630> with

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
Diana and echo are going to be huge with

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.510 
Diana and echo are going to be huge with
this<00:01:48.899> item<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.350> they<00:01:49.500> really<00:01:49.860> get<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.040> massive

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
this item and they really get a massive

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.429 
this item and they really get a massive
buff<00:01:50.850> as<00:01:51.149> well<00:01:51.750> as<00:01:51.840> we're<00:01:51.990> going<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.259> see<00:01:52.409> some

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
buff as well as we're going to see some

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.800 
buff as well as we're going to see some
other<00:01:52.829> AP<00:01:53.250> bruisers<00:01:53.670> probably<00:01:54.210> start<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.600> rise

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
other AP bruisers probably start to rise

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.929 
other AP bruisers probably start to rise
up<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.380> item<00:01:56.040> gives<00:01:56.250> quite<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.520> bit<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.820> damage

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
up the item gives quite a bit of damage

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.730 
up the item gives quite a bit of damage
so<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.299> wouldn't<00:01:57.600> be<00:01:57.689> too<00:01:57.930> surprised<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.590> see

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
so I wouldn't be too surprised to see

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.429 
so I wouldn't be too surprised to see
some<00:01:58.920> AP<00:01:59.250> junglers<00:01:59.430> become<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.689> strongest<00:02:01.020> in

junglers have always been extremely good
in<00:03:21.930> soloqueue<00:03:22.380> actually<00:03:22.830> since<00:03:23.010> they

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
in soloqueue actually since they

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.009 
in soloqueue actually since they
snowball<00:03:23.430> really<00:03:23.970> hard<00:03:24.209> and<00:03:24.390> tend<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.690> bring<00:03:24.870> a

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
snowball really hard and tend to bring a

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.300 
snowball really hard and tend to bring a
lot<00:03:25.200> of<00:03:25.230> things<00:03:25.530> that<00:03:25.650> makes<00:03:25.920> a<00:03:26.040> champion

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
lot of things that makes a champion

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.000 
lot of things that makes a champion
great<00:03:26.790> for<00:03:27.150> solo<00:03:27.480> q<00:03:27.750> since<00:03:28.500> they<00:03:28.590> tend<00:03:28.799> to<00:03:28.860> be

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
great for solo q since they tend to be

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.280 
great for solo q since they tend to be
able<00:03:29.100> to<00:03:29.310> hard<00:03:29.640> carry<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.060> game<00:03:30.390> completely<00:03:30.989> if

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
able to hard carry a game completely if

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.590

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
they get fed due to the burst damage in

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.440 
they get fed due to the burst damage in
their<00:03:33.750> kids<00:03:34.080> and<00:03:34.820> with<00:03:35.820> this<00:03:35.910> new<00:03:36.090> item<00:03:36.360> I

bring a mixed damaged team and because

bring a mixed damaged team and because
of<00:03:50.190> that<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.519> meta<00:03:50.700> is<00:03:50.850> going<00:03:51.120> to<00:03:51.209> shift<00:03:51.390> a

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
of that the meta is going to shift a

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.840 
of that the meta is going to shift a
tiny<00:03:51.810> bit<00:03:52.049> in<00:03:52.230> my<00:03:52.380> opinion<00:03:52.709> since<00:03:53.310> now<00:03:53.549> AP

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
tiny bit in my opinion since now AP

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.819 
tiny bit in my opinion since now AP
junglers<00:03:54.030> can<00:03:54.480> actually<00:03:54.989> exists<00:03:55.440> in<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.650> game

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
junglers can actually exists in the game

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.280 
junglers can actually exists in the game
at<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.190> competitive<00:03:56.489> level<00:03:56.910> however<00:03:57.750> AP

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
at the competitive level however AP

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.229 
at the competitive level however AP
junglers<00:03:58.470> tend<00:03:59.100> to<00:03:59.310> not<00:03:59.519> perform<00:03:59.850> that<00:04:00.180> well

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
junglers tend to not perform that well

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.110 
junglers tend to not perform that well
versus<00:04:00.900> tanks<00:04:01.290> since<00:04:01.829> burst<00:04:02.130> and<00:04:02.400> ap<00:04:02.730> damage

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
versus tanks since burst and ap damage

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.060 
versus tanks since burst and ap damage
tends<00:04:03.480> to<00:04:03.690> have<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:03.840> hard<00:04:04.110> time<00:04:04.290> killing<00:04:04.739> tanks

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
tends to have a hard time killing tanks

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.699 
tends to have a hard time killing tanks
so<00:04:05.700> they<00:04:06.150> might<00:04:06.480> not<00:04:06.750> be<00:04:06.959> that<00:04:07.140> great<00:04:07.320> in<00:04:07.590> the

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
so they might not be that great in the

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.009 
so they might not be that great in the
tank<00:04:07.950> meta<00:04:08.190> however<00:04:08.910> they<00:04:09.120> can<00:04:09.329> be<00:04:09.480> great

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
tank meta however they can be great

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.720 
tank meta however they can be great
against<00:04:10.590> other<00:04:10.769> bruisers<00:04:11.250> due<00:04:11.459> to<00:04:11.579> their

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
against other bruisers due to their

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.600 
against other bruisers due to their
burst<00:04:12.060> damage<00:04:12.329> so<00:04:13.170> AP<00:04:13.500> junglers<00:04:13.650> will<00:04:14.100> be<00:04:14.250> far

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
burst damage so AP junglers will be far

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.130 
burst damage so AP junglers will be far
from<00:04:14.850> overpowered<00:04:15.630> at<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:15.810> competitive

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
from overpowered at the competitive

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.170 
from overpowered at the competitive
level<00:04:16.530> but<00:04:17.100> they're<00:04:17.250> definitely<00:04:17.519> going<00:04:18.060> to

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
level but they're definitely going to

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.120 
level but they're definitely going to
become<00:04:18.510> fantastic<00:04:19.470> for<00:04:19.620> solo<00:04:19.859> queue<00:04:20.070> now

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
become fantastic for solo queue now

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.979 
become fantastic for solo queue now
since<00:04:20.790> they<00:04:20.880> can<00:04:21.030> snowball<00:04:21.390> in<00:04:21.510> hard<00:04:21.690> carry<00:04:21.900> a

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
since they can snowball in hard carry a

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.460 
since they can snowball in hard carry a
