00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:15.210
 so look there guys I'm rodrigo and I 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.550
 I have to admit that one of my 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.820
 great frustrations that starts already in the era 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.980
 of the 32 bits was the says it's a lot but a lot 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.600
 bad in the tony hawk series only 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.460
 warm 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.830
 I do not know if my friends that it was a 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.420
 too monstrous that the fact is that I 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.850
 never could do those maneuvers and 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.450
 As a right and all the time I fell into the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.129
 ground was disgrace because well today I will give 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.290
 my impressions about a title that 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.090
 come to end this my trauma 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.280
 tony hawk is it web site chan 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.230
 he arrives soon enough to go to this 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.850
 point to android and I say brief 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.890
 because at the moment it is only available 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.890
 in the New Zealand apple store 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.980
 as soon as it was announced this is received 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.440
 even criticism by some 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.630
 more hardcore gamers who said the 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.550
 tony hawk's legacy in videogames and 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.070
 reduce to an English style game 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:16.410
 sell home but I do not agree 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.410
 a lot of it and I'll say why 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.020
 first because it is not exactly 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.490
 of one among the rangers in practice he 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.500
 works from a series of 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.020
 very fast missions that usually last 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.000
 less than a minute you go through 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.460
 they are winning amy stars have to see 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.290
 the later stages in a well- 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.290
 similar to the angry birds series by 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.130
 example and the missions have 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.960
 varied 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.910
 in some of them you basically have 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.520
 than to dodge obstacles and get to the 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.930
 end but there are other more legal in 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.360
 that you have to imitate the maneuvers 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.860
 made by an opponent on the track and 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.810
 still others that you have to try 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.399
 to avoid obstacles when making 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.899
 best maneuvers possible with the 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.899
 cleanings and banisters that appear 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.850
 The cool thing is that it works fine with 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.330
 traditional white on the screen ie 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.280
 just passing the finger back and forth to 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.709
 diverting of things and suites for the 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.450
 clear sides but new ones are also 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.340
 all based on the direction you 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.810
 slide your finger when in the air or in 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.849
 on top of a handrail 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.950
 some are simpler 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.230
 just slide your finger in one direction and 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.120
 others more complex and want you to 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.860
 Be quick to move a finger to 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.860
 here and there at the right time 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.579
 the scores are given from 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.799
 variables such as the team in which 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:40.440
 you perform these maneuvers if you are 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.299
 adept Sergio before falling to the ground if 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.060
 you did miscellaneous tux and did not get rich 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.700
 Only one thing at a time did you understand? 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.709
 and this is the second point because I think 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.620
 that the game does not deserve tombini criticism 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.019
 making this simplification clearer. 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.390
 gameplay is even much leaner 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.920
 than anthony roux conventional but 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.299
 I still think there is space 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.400
 for a person to be better than the 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:05.239
 And the most important one I found 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.239
 fun experience 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.750
 these missions short lines that I spoke 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.560
 are part of the so-called shrek module 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.690
 session 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.580
 but there is also the survival mode that is 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.620
 a race that lasts until you hit yourself 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.160
 something or until a bar 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.630
 maneuvers in this way even more so than 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.730
 that in the other it is very important that you 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.440
 keep making combos and such 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.239
 it resembles a little more to a 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.280
 English of the year the traditional one because 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.890
 some tasks for you to do too 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.380
 how to collect items make certain 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.480
 tricks but still everything inside the 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.340
 rock universe because for example the 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.799
 things you need to collect are the 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.970
 letters of the word skate or those 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.970
 discs and so on 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.549
 as I already told you this is a free game 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.340
 and as most free games of 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.660
 nowadays in two types of currency one 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.360
 of them you get more quantity 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.459
 during the phases themselves and another 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.900
 and you only get paid when you 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.729
 level or something of the kind 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.320
 Of course, this second currency 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.720
 which is used to unlock to speak more 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.479
 fast all to not go in the game like 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.550
 new skaters new clothes new 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.190
 maneuvers if you do and everything else 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.919
 obviously you can pay real money 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.900
 to get that blessed already coin that 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.580
 you get more quantity too 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.039
 serves to unlock some little things 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.050
 but you have to add a lot 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:41.330
 usually translate into repeating 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.020
 over and over again the same phases 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.020
 You know what it's like 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:50.949
 this is even the side effect of an ep 

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:53.169
 free but not up to now 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.939
 bothered the fashion flashes and I think 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.369
 many people will end up preferring 

00:04:54.939 --> 00:05:00.999
 than having to pay for the game 

00:04:57.369 --> 00:05:02.889
 although I would prefer to pay so 

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:05.050
 Overall a release that really did 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:07.059
 pleased that proves that Tony Hawk alone 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.550
 can work very well 

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:11.649
 mobile devices with a 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.330
 type of gameplay that is satisfactory 

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:15.369
 and that adds things that go well beyond 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.409
 one in two flights and traditional but 

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:19.330
 without doubt this point of simplicity 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:20.529
 may be the main target of criticism of 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.209
 other people 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:23.589
 It's all a matter of personal taste without 

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:25.119
 doubts 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:27.189
