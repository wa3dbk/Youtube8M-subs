00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.789 
it now number two on my list is actually
the<00:01:24.060> steampunker<00:01:24.600> outfit<00:01:24.930> now<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.320> actually

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
the steampunker outfit now I actually

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.260 
the steampunker outfit now I actually
have<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.100> better<00:01:26.280> look<00:01:26.400> for<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.640> myself<00:01:26.670> because

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
have a better look for it myself because

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.609 
have a better look for it myself because
what<00:01:27.420> full<00:01:27.570> sprite<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.229> actually<00:01:28.380> got

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
what full sprite it and I actually got

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.440 
what full sprite it and I actually got
to<00:01:28.710> see<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:29.009> be<00:01:29.159> done<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:30.090> don't<00:01:30.240> know<00:01:30.299> why

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
to see that be done and I don't know why

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.210 
to see that be done and I don't know why
that<00:01:30.869> just<00:01:31.170> kind<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.560> makes<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.890> even<00:01:31.979> more

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
that just kind of makes it even more

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.830 
that just kind of makes it even more
special<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.670> me<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.270> real<00:01:33.420> reason<00:01:33.659> I

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
special to me but the real reason I

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.300 
special to me but the real reason I
actually<00:01:33.960> like<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.530> because<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.189> allows

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
actually like it is because it allows

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.120 
actually like it is because it allows
you<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.790> look<00:01:36.030> like<00:01:36.299> an<00:01:36.450> NPC<00:01:36.900> now<00:01:37.590> before<00:01:37.950> this

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130
