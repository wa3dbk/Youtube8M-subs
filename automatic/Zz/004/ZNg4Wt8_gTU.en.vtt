00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.210
 hey ho people today i'll show you 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.460
 I have my new books again 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.620
 a total of seven new books and one 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.089
 man even bought before there is still one 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.190
 a bit of advertising in my own case 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.900
 do this in april because of month and that 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.789
 so is my experiment for this month 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.619
 and the whole thing I'll hold on 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.730
 my second channel I make it 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.680
 video diary and upload 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.930
 most likely every day something high 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.820
 So you look in the infobox over there 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.990
 is the link to my second channel there 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.180
 finds the whole city 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.000
 and then it starts now 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.969
 The first thing I bought is eye 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.780
 by eye of jenny hannah schiwon for the 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.120
 wm 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.739
 that is exactly what I have with us in the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.570
 bookshop bought for a long time 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.460
 I have a real book in real life again 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.649
 bought the bookstore and not over 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.360
 The internet ordered it was too 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.860
 only thing that interested me in the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.660
 Bookstore, however, very very small 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.230
 I really wanted that in English 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.600
 read 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.640
 but then I saw it and that 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.829
 Cover is just so beautiful I think so 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.989
 so great and then I had to 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.689
 easy to take in German and yes it 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.939
 is contemporary so contemporary and 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.979
 I do not know exactly what it is about 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.960
 I think it's about three girls 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.530
 which we are on it and then yes 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.909
 I think about secrets and betrayals and 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.650
 intrigues and no idea 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.479
 and that's why I'm very excited 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.610
 but I do not know when I will 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.869
 read it will be as I said as 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.820
 second part is far from in 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.290
 prospect that just appeared 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.119
 was yes then I have one 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.860
 review copy of blessing verlag 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.600
 get and the strange 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.640
 bookstore of mister leadership broke 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.380
 by robin sloan and I have too 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.880
 already read the review comes on 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.680
 online next monday 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.549
 and the book is really good for me 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.850
 fallen and yes as I said more about it in 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.770
 the infobox not in the infobox no in 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.240
 the pension but maybe i will 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.200
 the countess should someday in the 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.790
 link infobox 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.619
 It's about a man of one 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.630
 backup job in a bookstore 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.090
 But this bookstore is accepted 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.880
 totally funny and has no normal 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.500
 customers and strange books and those 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.409
 Customers behave quite funny and 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.970
 that is why he is a mystery on the 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.770
 track and me that really a lot of fun 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.380
 made I liked super happy 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.360
 then I have more of Andrew 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.150
 smith I already read that 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.080
 this is the book of the straps always so 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.520
 hard and and then have to 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.020
 Tanja and I also bought that myself 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.060
 I've already read it, I 'll do it 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.920
 I also liked crying in the end and 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.560
 it is really a good book 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.290
 The writing style is really great, too 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.570
 more on this in my monthly review 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.210
 next book is the final destination 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.080
 Decision of the third and final part 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.450
 the trilogy 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.810
 I have already read that in English 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.710
 i own is in english but 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.710
 Of course, I also need the German 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.750
 version because then it looks on the shelf 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.880
 I actually liked the book anyway 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.190
 not quite as much as it has for me 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.350
 many many weaken and given out 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.300
 I will give you my book again 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.740
 to link now have determined yes 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.280
 some of you already read the book 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.050
 and mainburg talk is just a video in 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.120
 I read the book from beginning to end 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.040
 disassemble and also neat 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.140
 steeper so if you read the book 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.880
 this is definitely interesting for 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.250
 you can already say that it is 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.440
 not so positive is the video but 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.120
 Maybe you'll understand me, yes 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.230
 link below I will too 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.540
 in any case again in German 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.920
 read senders that must indeed be not the 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.030
 book already buy then I have to 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.640
 read every case in german 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.070
 I think then I still freaks from 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.930
 turn ling if you van thence it 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.610
 I'm just saying that rolling now 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.930
 certainly when the English pronounced 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.530
 it would probably be 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.580
 wendelin from burning or something like that 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.500
 elephant race 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.209
 I've donated by gordon 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.700
 because I have a challenge 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.320
 won and I am very happy 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.880
 that 's totally cute I still have 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.100
 never before but what does that mean but me 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.880
 It's super cute and it's half past time 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.709
 fully opened and yes me me 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.810
 like to look like 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.090
 then i still bought the storm 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.480
 swords of george rr martin the 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.670
 fifth part of that loves the on the 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.620
 song of ice and fire row game of 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.890
 throne oh my god you always have to 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.350
 says so much 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.940
 one agrees with them , yes I have 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.560
 meanwhile such a small obsession 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.359
 I always develop quite a lot 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.100
 I have to buy the walls so that I can 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.350
 can also read next and what knows 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.370
 I'm kind of a little complex somehow 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.350
 broke out with me 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.180
 but well now I have the fourth and 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.620
 the fifth part on the sub that is 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.210
 I will be the fourth part of the forest 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.860
 someday I would like to read the 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.630
 series so happy to look and say that 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.140
 every time i read about this series 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.080
 speech 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:41.230
 but it's just that way then I have mine 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.419
 still buy weigh fit and that is yes 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.580
 this book of this 30 days vegan 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.320
 challenge i also do a month vegan 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.260
 but I do not rely on this 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:54.370
 challenge on I just take it that way 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.500
 as yes as inspiration and he as 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.410
 recipe source and so on I have pm 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.850
 Marked by Irish recipes and that's why 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.950
 I think it's really helpful 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.750
 and probably will after this 30 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.340
 also sell again days I know it 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.590
 not yet that was it with the books 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.760
 now comes the manga and I have 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.030
 I get in touch 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.380
 bought part one and I have the anime 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.220
 yes last year in december 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.080
 seen 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.300
 I searched it through I love it 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.950
 about everything and also have the one yes 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.600
 even read further because I do not 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.370
 can wait for the second season and 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.200
 now it comes in two months 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.690
 intervals in German out the first 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.180
 band appeared now in march and i have 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.830
 Of course, I immediately got it and he 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.560
 is not quite as good as the anime of 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.930
 Anime it really better but it was 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.340
 Still great and I love it and me 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.280
 I'll get another video at some point 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.780
 I think that was how it was 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.160
 it again from me and mine 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.419
 new books somehow the video is 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.280
 already so short and sweet 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.510
 but I really like that 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.220
 like I said I have mine 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.320
