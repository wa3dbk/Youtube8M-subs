00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
the brown will pot but a little nudge in

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.660 
the brown will pot but a little nudge in
behind<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.649> brown<00:00:34.829> he<00:00:34.980> can<00:00:35.100> get<00:00:35.219> on<00:00:35.370> behind

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
behind the brown he can get on behind

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.190 
behind the brown he can get on behind
the<00:00:35.820> green<00:00:36.030> also<00:00:37.850> that's<00:00:38.850> what<00:00:39.059> he<00:00:39.200> fancied

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
the green also that's what he fancied

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.200 
the green also that's what he fancied
rather<00:00:40.620> than<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.010> delicate<00:00:41.430> little<00:00:41.460> shot<00:00:41.940> one

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
rather than the delicate little shot one

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.400 
rather than the delicate little shot one
and<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.260> think<00:00:43.590> he<00:00:43.739> may<00:00:43.980> just<00:00:44.460> have<00:00:45.260> left<00:00:46.260> a

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
and I think he may just have left a

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.779 
and I think he may just have left a
little<00:00:46.620> bit<00:00:47.090> of<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.239> red<00:00:48.420> sticking<00:00:49.260> out<00:00:52.789> is

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
little bit of the red sticking out is

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.520 
little bit of the red sticking out is
there<00:00:54.000> enough<00:00:54.239> there<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.510> get<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.110> potting

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
there enough there to get to the potting
