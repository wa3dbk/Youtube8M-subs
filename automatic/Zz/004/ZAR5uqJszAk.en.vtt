days<00:01:04.720> because<00:01:04.989> only<00:01:05.890> you<00:01:05.979> know<00:01:06.130> the<00:01:06.160> bots<00:01:06.430> and

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
days because only you know the bots and

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.580

stuff<00:01:07.240> they're<00:01:07.390> coming<00:01:07.630> back<00:01:07.780> but<00:01:08.440> we're<00:01:08.560> just

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
stuff they're coming back but we're just

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.010 
stuff they're coming back but we're just
going<00:01:08.830> to<00:01:08.860> learn<00:01:08.979> to<00:01:09.130> adapt<00:01:09.509> it's<00:01:10.509> like<00:01:10.750> it's

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
going to learn to adapt it's like it's

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.170 
going to learn to adapt it's like it's
like<00:01:11.080> Waterworld<00:01:11.500> when<00:01:11.979> the<00:01:12.369> polar<00:01:12.610> ice<00:01:12.820> caps

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
like Waterworld when the polar ice caps

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.380 
like Waterworld when the polar ice caps
melt<00:01:13.450> and<00:01:14.399> they<00:01:15.399> must<00:01:15.550> adapt<00:01:15.940> to<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.180> water

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
melt and they must adapt to the water

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.060 
melt and they must adapt to the water
rising<00:01:16.899> it's<00:01:17.080> just<00:01:17.289> like<00:01:17.320> the<00:01:17.560> bots<00:01:17.800> they're

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
rising it's just like the bots they're

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.540 
rising it's just like the bots they're
rising<00:01:18.310> up<00:01:18.700> if<00:01:19.420> we<00:01:19.600> just<00:01:19.780> got<00:01:19.960> any<00:01:20.170> no<00:01:20.399> let<00:01:21.399> them

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
rising up if we just got any no let them

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.880 
rising up if we just got any no let them
do<00:01:21.759> their<00:01:21.940> thing<00:01:22.320> nothing<00:01:23.320> we<00:01:23.410> can<00:01:23.440> do<00:01:23.710> until

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890
