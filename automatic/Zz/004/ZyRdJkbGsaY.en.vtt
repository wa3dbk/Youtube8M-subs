 I will show what is included in the box 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.869
 to begin with we came across some 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.240
 manuals which give us 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.820
 information about the product and some 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.830
 advice on how to use it even if you're 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.710
 heights I doubt very much that someone does not know 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.600
 how to use a portos for those who do not 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.240
 they know it when you buy a product from 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.490
 support in red you are donating a 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.460
 part of your purchase to the fight against 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.619
 AIDS in Africa and here we have the reason 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.490
 principal by which people buy 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.410
 support products the stamps inside 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.539
 from the box we also find the new 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.910
 lightning cable just like those too 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:04.060
 new ipods of which I will make a 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.250
 review in a future video is worth mentioning 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.530
 that the spots that this ipod toch includes 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.200
 they do not have volume control or 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.480
 microphone which is a pity given the 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.000
 price of this device 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.849
 and finally we have this little strap 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.190
 who supports bad look in a few moments 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.110
 I will show you how to use it 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.870
 now let's go with the attraction 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.750
 main video here is the ipod 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.430
 fifth generation touch and the first 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.740
 what catches my attention is what 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.870
 incredibly thin and light that is 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.830
 apart from its construction quality 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.930
 it's quite high this device counts 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.600
 with the same screen that we found in 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.570
 the iphone 5 which is a retina display 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:52.870
 of 4 inches is to say that its resolution 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:55.180
 is 1,136 x 640 which gives us 326 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.340
 pixels per inch and the system 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.220
 operative with which this ipod comes is 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.550
 ios 6 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.990
 at the bottom of this device 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.360
 we found the new lightning connector 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.210
 like the entry for hearing aids and 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.730
 the speaker on the right side of the 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.830
 ipod we have volume control and in 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.620
 the top only the button 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.200
 on and off in the back 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.780
 we found an isight camera of 5 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.150
 megapixels just like the microphone and 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.910
 the led flash and if we go down 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.060
 we found this little circle to which 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.340
 I'll call it a nipple and if you squeeze the nipple 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.440
 it rises a little to leave us 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.180
 introduce the strap or look that 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.700
 I showed a few moments ago 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.799
 before finishing this box sing I want 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.390
 highlight again the great quality in the 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.969
 design and construction of this 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.799
 first impression device 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:51.069
 it has really left me with a very good 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:53.200
 taste of mouth later I will bring you the 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.239
 review of this device so 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.489

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.750

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.750

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.070
