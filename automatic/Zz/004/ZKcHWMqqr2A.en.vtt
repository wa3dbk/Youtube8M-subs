 that little lost but we certainly 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.810
 can win a win on the eight

 the abbot deschamps 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.620

 and go through the lax with the 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.860
 possibility to dribble the goalkeeper a 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.260
 good exit and then defense who 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.510
 save this hot balloon again a

 luck in the surface a ball missed the 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:29.320

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.770
 in the surface the little hook 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.190
 additional withdrawals for the

 hit 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.290
 it's saving second chance this child 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.979
 in the back of the nets a very good action 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:56.130

 gia 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.350
 especially as the goalkeeper of the 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.420
 auxerrois olive sorin saved the 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.800
 situation

 cashed 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.020
 it's very encouraging the opportunity 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.840
 maybe to go back in the first 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.050

 already made some results 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.950
 interesting outside since the 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.150
 start of the season a team of cranks 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.700
 much more offensive in second 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.739
 period with this balloon that nearly failed 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.140
 pass over the goalkeeper knows very 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.049
 play well to have counter this ball in

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.420
 createil insists with this recovery of the 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.450
 head is this time it's in the bottom of

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.019
 Senegalese scored his fifth goal of 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.650
 the season and lets creteil come back 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.440
 at 1 everywhere 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.890
 this auxerre attacking to try to 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.570
 take over the direction of operations 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.100
 but will not tighten very well 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.470
 good point taken outside for 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.890
 Créteil 1 everywhere between auxerre and the 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.890
 cristoliens
