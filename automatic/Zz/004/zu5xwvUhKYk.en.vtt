find themselves six points out of a

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.280 
find themselves six points out of a
playoff<00:03:07.640> spot<00:03:08.000> with<00:03:08.330> a<00:03:08.360> game<00:03:08.600> in<00:03:08.780> hand<00:03:08.810> on<00:03:09.140> the

playoff spot with a game in hand on the

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.229 
playoff spot with a game in hand on the
Islanders<00:03:09.740> considering<00:03:10.520> where<00:03:10.670> things<00:03:11.000> were

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
Islanders considering where things were

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.940 
Islanders considering where things were
a<00:03:11.269> few<00:03:11.660> weeks<00:03:11.900> ago<00:03:12.050> I<00:03:12.140> think<00:03:12.530> leaves<00:03:12.739> man

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
a few weeks ago I think leaves man

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.500 
a few weeks ago I think leaves man
should<00:03:13.160> be<00:03:13.250> excited<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:13.940> here's<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.300> thing

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
should be excited and here's the thing

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.720 
should be excited and here's the thing
based<00:03:14.870> on<00:03:15.140> the<00:03:15.260> way<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:15.560> season<00:03:15.800> is<00:03:16.070> gone<00:03:16.250> the

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
based on the way the season is gone the

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.130 
based on the way the season is gone the
least<00:03:16.940> probably<00:03:17.510> won't<00:03:17.780> make<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:18.110> playoffs

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
least probably won't make the playoffs

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.590 
least probably won't make the playoffs
but<00:03:18.739> if<00:03:18.890> they<00:03:19.100> do<00:03:19.160> make<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:19.940> playoffs<00:03:20.330> they

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
but if they do make the playoffs they

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.900 
but if they do make the playoffs they
would<00:03:20.810> have<00:03:20.840> had<00:03:21.050> to<00:03:21.170> play<00:03:21.350> so<00:03:21.910> ridiculously

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
would have had to play so ridiculously

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.820 
would have had to play so ridiculously
well<00:03:23.209> between<00:03:23.450> now<00:03:23.870> and<00:03:24.110> then<00:03:24.230> that<00:03:24.709> they

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
well between now and then that they

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.320 
well between now and then that they
would<00:03:24.980> be<00:03:25.010> one<00:03:25.340> of<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.580> best<00:03:25.790> teams<00:03:26.120> in<00:03:26.269> the

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
would be one of the best teams in the

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.140 
would be one of the best teams in the
NHL<00:03:26.630> it's<00:03:27.140> very<00:03:27.590> unrealistic<00:03:28.340> to<00:03:28.670> expect<00:03:28.820> the

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
NHL it's very unrealistic to expect the

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.240 
NHL it's very unrealistic to expect the
least<00:03:29.360> to<00:03:29.510> do<00:03:29.630> this<00:03:29.780> but<00:03:30.140> there's<00:03:30.830> over<00:03:31.070> 50

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
least to do this but there's over 50

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.949 
least to do this but there's over 50
games<00:03:31.670> left<00:03:32.030> and<00:03:32.209> stranger<00:03:32.630> things<00:03:32.750> have
