00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
from a plant source it is the

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.689 
from a plant source it is the
monounsaturated<00:00:28.199> fat<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.250> one<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.640> our

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
friends so if you compare that down

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.729 
friends so if you compare that down
stavis<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:33.000> even<00:00:33.360> lean<00:00:33.600> beef<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.559> still

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
stavis to even lean beef it is still

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.459 
stavis to even lean beef it is still
less<00:00:34.950> fat<00:00:35.399> than<00:00:35.430> beef<00:00:35.670> but<00:00:36.120> just<00:00:36.780> rest<00:00:37.170> assured

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
less fat than beef but just rest assured

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
that it is monounsaturated fat so what

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.880
