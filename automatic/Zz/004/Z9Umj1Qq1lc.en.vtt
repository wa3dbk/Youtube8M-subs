William actually says this

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.700 
William actually says this
to<00:02:13.450> that<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:15.700> balancer<00:02:16.270> like<00:02:17.140> it'll<00:02:17.410> try<00:02:17.680> to

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
to that the balancer like it'll try to

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.500 
to that the balancer like it'll try to
connect<00:02:18.130> you<00:02:18.250> to<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.490> full<00:02:18.790> server<00:02:19.120> but<00:02:19.420> really

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
connect you to a full server but really

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.760 
connect you to a full server but really
it's<00:02:22.510> just<00:02:23.080> it's<00:02:23.740> just<00:02:23.770> it's<00:02:24.550> just<00:02:24.760> um<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:26.230> it

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
it's just it's just it's just um so it

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.140 
it's just it's just it's just um so it
will<00:02:26.890> connect<00:02:27.130> it<00:02:27.430> will<00:02:27.580> try<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.730> connect<00:02:28.030> you

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
will connect it will try to connect you

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.270 
will connect it will try to connect you
to<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.300> full<00:02:28.540> server<00:02:28.840> so<00:02:29.110> you<00:02:29.650> just<00:02:29.800> keep<00:02:29.950> trying

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
to a full server so you just keep trying

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.430 
to a full server so you just keep trying
to<00:02:32.790> connect<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:33.850> a<00:02:35.250> capture<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.370> flag<00:02:36.490> server

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
to connect to a capture the flag server

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.340 
to connect to a capture the flag server
if<00:02:38.440> it<00:02:38.620> appears<00:02:38.980> like<00:02:39.540> all<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.959> time<00:02:41.140> then

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
if it appears like all the time then

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.370 
if it appears like all the time then
probably<00:02:41.740> the<00:02:41.890> servers<00:02:42.220> are<00:02:42.340> full<00:02:42.610> so<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:44.290> I'll

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
probably the servers are full so so I'll

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.550 
probably the servers are full so so I'll
be<00:02:44.560> your<00:02:45.010> best<00:02:45.220> bet<00:02:45.490> so<00:02:45.940> you<00:02:46.930> just<00:02:47.140> I'll<00:02:47.290> keep

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
be your best bet so you just I'll keep

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.270 
be your best bet so you just I'll keep
trying<00:02:47.860> to<00:02:47.980> connect<00:02:48.250> until<00:02:48.520> it<00:02:48.670> connects<00:02:50.280> so

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
trying to connect until it connects so

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.280 
trying to connect until it connects so
really<00:02:51.640> there's<00:02:51.820> nothing<00:02:51.970> wrong<00:02:52.270> if<00:02:52.600> there<00:02:53.140> is

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290

really there's nothing wrong if there is
something<00:02:53.500> wrong<00:02:53.620> it<00:02:53.920> will<00:02:53.980> say<00:02:54.390> cannot

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
something wrong it will say cannot

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.080 
something wrong it will say cannot
connect<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.810> server<00:02:56.520> so<00:02:57.520> it<00:02:57.700> says<00:02:57.850> cannot

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
connect to server so it says cannot

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.300 
connect to server so it says cannot
connect<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.600> server<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.860> server<00:02:59.890> is

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
connect the server and the server is

remember numbers so so yeah so you would

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:42.300 
remember numbers so so yeah so you would
copy<00:04:38.530> this<00:04:39.010> paste<00:04:39.550> it<00:04:39.910> and<00:04:40.300> then<00:04:41.050> the<00:04:41.229> port<00:04:41.500> 103

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
copy this paste it and then the port 103

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.760 
copy this paste it and then the port 103
-<00:04:42.520> as<00:04:42.669> you<00:04:42.789> can<00:04:42.880> see<00:04:42.940> and<00:04:43.930> then<00:04:44.080> you<00:04:44.289> would<00:04:44.440> go

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
- as you can see and then you would go

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.920 
- as you can see and then you would go
can<00:04:44.950> I<00:04:45.010> can<00:04:45.160> have<00:04:45.280> a<00:04:45.310> jolly<00:04:45.580> old<00:04:45.789> time<00:04:45.940> on<00:04:46.390> the

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
been moved to NCP stats so now you know

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.200 
been moved to NCP stats so now you know
view<00:05:14.530> all<00:05:15.039> the<00:05:15.340> server<00:05:15.520> details<00:05:15.700> figure

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
view all the server details figure

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.880 
view all the server details figure
whitelisted<00:05:16.840> public<00:05:17.200> servers<00:05:17.530> so<00:05:17.680> if<00:05:17.770> you

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
whitelisted public servers so if you

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.850 
whitelisted public servers so if you
want<00:05:18.070> to<00:05:18.099> join<00:05:18.280> like<00:05:18.810> let's<00:05:19.810> say<00:05:20.110> Kingdom

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
you would copy IP address at the port

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.740 
you would copy IP address at the port
and<00:05:26.800> then<00:05:27.340> you<00:05:27.520> would<00:05:27.669> be<00:05:27.849> on<00:05:28.270> your<00:05:28.330> way<00:05:28.660> so<00:05:30.750> so
