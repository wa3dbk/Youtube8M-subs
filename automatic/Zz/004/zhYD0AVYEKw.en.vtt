00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 hi today we talk about planned 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.649
 whether last fans I do not know if that 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.320
 everyone knows planned option is very ob 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.910
 Soloist fans means that we are the devices 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.009
 bought us after a certain 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.220
 Break time and break it 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.380
 should we again new devices 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.330
 buy how is it now with me 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.449
 why am i doing a video because of my 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:28.830
 printer of the brand samsung scored 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.359
 365 how has stopped his assignment 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.180
 meet and indeed because no longer pressure 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.469
 and that tells me the printer is she 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.390
 a new picture unit before and 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.670
 because that is because the image unit 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.649
 he does not want to print like that anymore 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.379
 Now it costs such a picture unit 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.879
 for this printer around 100 100 120 euro 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.460
 But it is such that these printers 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.989
 mostly just say they are broken because 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.590
 that is a certain number of 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.360
 have printed pages so and believe that 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.100
 me that at the printer definitely 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.480
 The case is because I have so much 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.250
 so that not yet printed on now 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.989
 once the picture unit is already broken 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.140
 I can order from the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.150
 internet a reset chip for that 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.920
 makes sure the printer thinks he's new 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.049
 not in here so down here 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.580
 thing you see it already looks exactly like that 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.979
 like what's in here now needs 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.040
 So the old out that they lined new 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.790
 so now I can see the old one here 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:30.420
 pull out victorious from behind so than 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:34.090
 a 1 1 less resistance in there now 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.810
 namely the 9th 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:45.580
 Just crimp it in now 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:45.580
 go and go 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.590
 and tell me, enlightened green 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.080
 actually is also subject to phase 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.500
 and he is ready so if new printer 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.920
 says thomas lehr or directly in patrons 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.570
 empty 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.610
 Do not be shit before 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.369
 you somehow again 80 60 euro for 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.990
 one spends one comes after this one 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.570
 Riester chips saw how easy 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.850
 that was old out nine rows that and 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.380
 the printer is like new write me 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.390
 The comments here so what 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.400
 ever has and if so at which 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.690
 device in which we have solved or 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.420
 Write me in the comments 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.280
 old crass I'm sure already full 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.670
 a lot of money for such a shit spent 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.330
 So for the original, that's it 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.330
 it was bye bye
