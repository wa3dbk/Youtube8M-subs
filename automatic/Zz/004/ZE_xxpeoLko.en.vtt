00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:06.410
 in my work philosophy the minimally invasive surgery is at the center of the 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.569
 of my business 

00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:10.999
 I particularly like facial surgery 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:13.529
 and I believe the future 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:17.079
 the present and the future of facial surgery is too much in the mini 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:20.920
 invasiveness there is an increasingly soft surgery and always use 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:23.220
 more the techniques 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.560
 of regenerative medicine 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.999
 with this in mind 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:28.380
 I believe that 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.050
 adipose tissue and mesenchymal stem cells 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.010
 let's take the big step forward with the big news in the field of 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.670
 facial rejuvenation 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.210
 as it combines a minimally invasive surgery for medicine 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.390
 regenerative 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.630
 guarantees not only a result 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.810
 invasive for the patient 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.990
 but above all it guarantees the most beautiful most harmonious most natural note 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.510
 and that lasts longer over time 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.390
 in this perspective the possibility is the great possibility we have today 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.010
 of cryopreservation 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.270
 fat cells and liquid mesenchymal stem cells 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.909
 It is a great opportunity that we can provide our patients today 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.460
 how all this happens 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.740
 during the surgery 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.450
 endoscopic endoscopic facial rejuvenation surgery 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.220
 if you buy a patient's fatty tissue 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.400
 in part what I feel of being used during the surgery for 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.400
 to implant precisely during the operation itself 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.540
 adipose tissue therefore also adultes mesenchymal cells and stem cells 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.670
 in part other adipose tissue is cryopreserved 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.260
 so thank you then for your cooperation 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.910
 anyway I always 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.400
 we can 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.010
 keep these fat cells from these mesenchymal stem cells 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.250
 use with the patient 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.670
 how 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.940
 in the world that is more natural to maintain 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.539
 a rejuvenation of the face 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.790
 periodically going to implant cells 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.089
 adipose stem cells 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:16.389
 the crazy ones 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:20.209
 this can happen depending on the case after six months after a year 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.929
 the periodicity of the appraised by home case 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:25.829
 with the doctor and with madness 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:31.599
 this is a great opportunity I repeat not just because it allows the patient 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.180
 to have a natural result harmonious for nothing artificial for bikes 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.259
 uses its own fabric 

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:39.760
 but also a great one 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.360
 a large one is a guarantee of safety because its cells cannot 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.390
 in no way give reactions of little intolerance of rejection 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.129
 and above all a chance to maintain 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.209
 vitality 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.030
 the beauty of one's own. over time with extremely little invasive treatments 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:03.100
 obviously this possibility 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.100
 to use fat cells stem cells 

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:09.509
 for patients it can be 

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:12.509
 also checked how many interventions such as a liposculpture 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:17.969
 or patients who wish to remove fat tissue in areas of the 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:18.969
 body 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:21.259
 where to create imperfections 

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:26.049
 they may have the great opportunity to preserve fat tissue cost then 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.190
 as in the previous case of 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.870
 blekinge of the mink chioggia of the body without preserving the adipose tissue 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:35.749
 which can then be reused later 

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:39.979
 for purposes like always of health through the great possibility of the 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:41.419
 regenerative medicine 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:44.370
 for certain pathologies that can benefit from. 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.209
 the use of stem cells but in the field of aesthetics 

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:52.250
 to be able to use these cells to make gods 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.840
 for those that are called lipofilling of the face but also other areas of the 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.949
 body 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:00.789
 in fact we remember that the adipose tissue can be implanted not only 

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:01.829
 in the face 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.739
 to give rejuvenation an effect 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.289
 but it can also be implanted in particular areas such as the ugly type breast 

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:12.819
 to restore a toning in areas where the chaff trophy loss of the face 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.999
 adipose to pact for dra. tuna
