is<00:02:15.870> actually<00:02:16.079> really<00:02:16.620> surprising<00:02:17.220> because<00:02:17.370> I

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
is actually really surprising because I

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:22.819 
is actually really surprising because I
know<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.150> few<00:02:18.239> people<00:02:19.159> who<00:02:20.159> have<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:22.530> real

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
know a few people who have the real

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.309 
know a few people who have the real
thing<00:02:22.860> of<00:02:23.250> stainless<00:02:24.150> steel<00:02:24.180> master<00:02:25.049> sores

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
thing of stainless steel master sores

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.500 
thing of stainless steel master sores
look<00:02:25.530> just<00:02:25.769> like<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.129> and<00:02:26.360> instead<00:02:27.360> of

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
look just like this and instead of

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.979 
look just like this and instead of
having<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:28.500> inscriptions<00:02:29.280> here<00:02:29.730> or<00:02:29.989> around

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
having the inscriptions here or around

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.199 
having the inscriptions here or around
here<00:02:31.470> that<00:02:31.709> they<00:02:31.890> have<00:02:31.920> just<00:02:32.220> dots<00:02:32.549> like<00:02:33.000> they

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
here that they have just dots like they

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.869 
here that they have just dots like they
couldn't<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:34.530> mold<00:02:34.799> wouldn't<00:02:35.220> allow<00:02:35.370> them<00:02:35.640> to

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
couldn't the mold wouldn't allow them to

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.699 
couldn't the mold wouldn't allow them to
or<00:02:36.299> whatever<00:02:36.840> reason<00:02:37.200> put<00:02:37.349> the<00:02:37.470> actual

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
or whatever reason put the actual

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.229 
or whatever reason put the actual
instructions<00:02:38.129> so<00:02:38.609> that's<00:02:38.760> pretty<00:02:38.909> cool<00:02:39.000> to

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
instructions so that's pretty cool to

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.970 
instructions so that's pretty cool to
see<00:02:39.299> the<00:02:39.480> actual<00:02:39.750> hylian<00:02:40.170> text<00:02:40.590> on<00:02:40.709> there

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
see the actual hylian text on there

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.089 
see the actual hylian text on there
that's<00:02:41.819> just<00:02:42.060> me<00:02:42.620> you'll<00:02:43.620> notice<00:02:43.799> a<00:02:43.950> few

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
that's just me you'll notice a few

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.910 
that's just me you'll notice a few
changes<00:02:44.430> actually<00:02:44.909> while<00:02:45.870> it<00:02:46.019> is<00:02:46.139> a<00:02:46.170> really

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
changes actually while it is a really

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.589 
changes actually while it is a really
really<00:02:46.950> really<00:02:47.430> good<00:02:47.730> replica<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.420> it's

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
really really good replica and it's

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:49.759 
really really good replica and it's
really<00:02:48.780> nice<00:02:49.019> and<00:02:49.079> everything<00:02:49.319> there<00:02:49.650> are<00:02:49.739> a

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
really nice and everything there are a

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.550 
really nice and everything there are a
few<00:02:50.010> small<00:02:50.250> changes<00:02:50.400> they<00:02:50.940> added<00:02:51.329> to<00:02:51.480> it<00:02:51.659> the

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
few small changes they added to it the

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.640 
few small changes they added to it the
first<00:02:52.829> probably<00:02:53.549> noticeable<00:02:54.269> of<00:02:54.989> two<00:02:55.349> things

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
first probably noticeable of two things

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.559 
first probably noticeable of two things
is<00:02:55.859> that<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:58.040> this<00:02:59.040> version<00:02:59.280> is<00:02:59.609> a<00:02:59.670> two-handed

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
is that a this version is a two-handed

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.069 
is that a this version is a two-handed
sword<00:03:02.239> traditionally<00:03:03.239> that<00:03:03.420> short<00:03:03.689> is<00:03:03.780> using

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
sword traditionally that short is using

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.259 
sword traditionally that short is using
one<00:03:04.290> hand<00:03:05.480> but<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.629> can<00:03:06.840> use<00:03:07.079> it<00:03:07.109> one<00:03:07.379> hand

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
one hand but you can use it one hand

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.500 
one hand but you can use it one hand
it's<00:03:09.269> not<00:03:09.510> that<00:03:09.780> bad<00:03:10.019> but<00:03:10.799> it's<00:03:11.129> definitely

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
it's not that bad but it's definitely

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.539 
it's not that bad but it's definitely
works<00:03:12.510> also<00:03:12.810> very<00:03:13.319> well<00:03:13.409> as<00:03:13.799> a<00:03:13.829> two-handed

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
works also very well as a two-handed

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.390 
works also very well as a two-handed
weapon<00:03:14.970> so<00:03:15.959> you<00:03:16.079> see<00:03:16.230> they<00:03:16.379> lengthened<00:03:16.949> the

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
weapon so you see they lengthened the

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.030 
weapon so you see they lengthened the
handle<00:03:17.819> there<00:03:18.030> i'm<00:03:18.239> assuming<00:03:18.690> it<00:03:19.019> is<00:03:19.169> because

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
handle there i'm assuming it is because

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.309 
handle there i'm assuming it is because
the<00:03:20.129> blade<00:03:20.400> is<00:03:20.639> just<00:03:20.819> so<00:03:21.120> freaking<00:03:21.750> long<00:03:21.959> and

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
the blade is just so freaking long and

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.449 
the blade is just so freaking long and
heavy<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.829> its<00:03:23.699> mass<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:24.209> it<00:03:24.329> i<00:03:24.510> figured<00:03:25.459> you

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
heavy and its mass to it i figured you

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:27.710 
heavy and its mass to it i figured you
know<00:03:26.549> they<00:03:26.639> probably<00:03:26.849> said<00:03:27.150> okay<00:03:27.419> we'll<00:03:27.569> have

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
know they probably said okay we'll have

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.159 
know they probably said okay we'll have
a<00:03:27.750> longer<00:03:28.049> handle<00:03:29.299> to<00:03:30.299> kind<00:03:30.510> of<00:03:30.540> balance<00:03:30.780> out

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
a longer handle to kind of balance out

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.589 
a longer handle to kind of balance out
the<00:03:31.530> weight<00:03:31.709> distribution<00:03:32.220> there<00:03:32.970> we're<00:03:33.419> sure

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
the weight distribution there we're sure

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.509 
the weight distribution there we're sure
we<00:03:33.959> all<00:03:34.139> in<00:03:34.260> all<00:03:34.379> is<00:03:34.560> not<00:03:34.829> a<00:03:34.889> bad<00:03:35.069> idea<00:03:35.099> because

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
we all in all is not a bad idea because

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.729 
we all in all is not a bad idea because
if<00:03:35.699> you<00:03:35.790> had<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:36.199> shorter<00:03:37.199> a<00:03:37.230> really<00:03:37.590> short

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
if you had a shorter a really short

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.379 
if you had a shorter a really short
handle<00:03:38.069> and<00:03:38.250> one<00:03:38.340> having<00:03:38.639> i<00:03:38.790> think<00:03:39.209> it'd<00:03:39.269> be<00:03:39.299> a

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
handle and one having i think it'd be a

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.930 
handle and one having i think it'd be a
lot<00:03:39.659> easier<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:40.409> just<00:03:40.590> snap<00:03:41.040> off<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.489> handle

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
lot easier to just snap off the handle

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.640 
lot easier to just snap off the handle
so<00:03:42.150> maybe<00:03:42.479> it's<00:03:42.690> just<00:03:42.720> weight<00:03:42.989> distribution

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
so maybe it's just weight distribution

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.520 
so maybe it's just weight distribution
there<00:03:43.829> I'm<00:03:44.340> not<00:03:44.519> exactly<00:03:44.790> sure<00:03:45.260> the<00:03:46.260> second

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
there I'm not exactly sure the second

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.039 
there I'm not exactly sure the second
thing<00:03:46.650> that's<00:03:46.859> really<00:03:47.010> noticeable<00:03:47.459> is<00:03:47.729> this

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
thing that's really noticeable is this

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.140 
thing that's really noticeable is this
the<00:03:49.049> wings<00:03:49.319> if<00:03:50.250> you've<00:03:50.430> seen<00:03:50.609> any<00:03:50.879> of<00:03:51.030> the

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
the wings if you've seen any of the

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.990 
the wings if you've seen any of the
concept<00:03:51.659> art<00:03:51.900> or<00:03:52.400> you<00:03:53.400> know<00:03:53.459> played<00:03:53.699> the<00:03:53.819> games

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
concept art or you know played the games

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.890 
concept art or you know played the games
or<00:03:54.120> anything<00:03:54.150> you<00:03:54.359> know<00:03:54.389> that<00:03:54.629> the<00:03:54.720> wings

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
or anything you know that the wings

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.409 
or anything you know that the wings
should<00:03:55.199> span<00:03:55.530> out<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:55.919> me<00:03:56.040> about<00:03:56.220> here<00:03:56.879> so

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
should span out to me about here so

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.030 
should span out to me about here so
that's<00:03:57.599> a<00:03:57.720> good<00:03:57.900> you<00:03:58.229> know<00:03:58.349> inch<00:03:58.620> to<00:03:59.010> inch

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
that's a good you know inch to inch

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.119 
that's a good you know inch to inch
difference<00:03:59.510> but<00:04:00.510> it<00:04:00.569> really<00:04:00.720> doesn't<00:04:00.930> make<00:04:01.409> it

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
difference but it really doesn't make it

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.520 
difference but it really doesn't make it
doesn't<00:04:02.389> make<00:04:03.389> too<00:04:03.629> much<00:04:03.659> of<00:04:03.780> a<00:04:03.930> big<00:04:04.109> deal<00:04:04.139> to

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
doesn't make too much of a big deal to

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.399 
doesn't make too much of a big deal to
me<00:04:04.889> personally<00:04:05.699> I<00:04:05.729> mean<00:04:05.940> it's<00:04:06.090> it's<00:04:06.659> a<00:04:06.930> such<00:04:07.379> a

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:07.409 
me personally I mean it's it's a such a

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:09.979 
me personally I mean it's it's a such a
really<00:04:07.620> nice<00:04:08.269> piece<00:04:09.269> that<00:04:09.510> I<00:04:09.599> kind<00:04:09.870> of

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
really nice piece that I kind of

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.080 
really nice piece that I kind of
overlook<00:04:10.379> it<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:10.739> there's<00:04:11.340> one<00:04:11.400> other<00:04:11.699> small

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
overlook it and there's one other small

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
of latex swords and I'm assuming they

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.610
