00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
Ram just creates a virtual ram drive or

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.200 
Ram just creates a virtual ram drive or
block<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.160> memory<00:00:47.250> which<00:00:47.430> computer<00:00:47.910> treats<00:00:48.090> as

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
block of memory which computer treats as

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.850 
block of memory which computer treats as
if<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.570> was<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.750> disk<00:00:49.020> drive<00:00:49.110> by<00:00:49.410> storing<00:00:49.739> files

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
if it was a disk drive by storing files

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.350 
if it was a disk drive by storing files
or<00:00:50.100> programs<00:00:50.129> into<00:00:50.700> memory<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.000> can<00:00:51.120> speed<00:00:51.329> up

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
or programs into memory you can speed up

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.479 
or programs into memory you can speed up

even<00:00:58.440> through<00:00:58.620> reboots<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.910> basically<00:01:00.629> it

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
even through reboots so basically it

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.119 
even through reboots so basically it
helps<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.670> run<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.530> you'll<00:01:04.890> see<00:01:05.100> a

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
helps it run but it you you you'll see a

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.859 
helps it run but it you you you'll see a
difference<00:01:05.729> but<00:01:06.030> it's<00:01:06.180> not<00:01:06.390> going<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.689> make

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
difference but it's not going to make

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.630 
difference but it's not going to make
you<00:01:06.930> know<00:01:07.200> your<00:01:07.770> minecraft<00:01:08.720> pimped<00:01:09.720> whatever

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
you know your minecraft pimped whatever

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.710 
you know your minecraft pimped whatever

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.080 
disk so I'm going to look and I'm going
to<00:01:20.130> open<00:01:20.430> ram<00:01:21.330> disk<00:01:22.040> mmm<00:01:23.040> minecraft<00:01:23.729> seems<00:01:23.939> to

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
to open ram disk mmm minecraft seems to

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.080 
to open ram disk mmm minecraft seems to
be<00:01:24.180> down<00:01:24.299> anyway<00:01:25.229> i'm<00:01:26.130> going<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.520> open<00:01:26.549> ram

because it looks like you've acquired a

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.740 
because it looks like you've acquired a
disk<00:03:00.300> drive<00:03:00.590> open<00:03:01.590> files<00:03:01.860> to<00:03:02.400> keep<00:03:03.060> files<00:03:03.269> okay

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
disk drive open files to keep files okay

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:13.809 
okay as I said before it's not going to
significantly<00:05:11.029> boost<00:05:11.960> it<00:05:12.259> so<00:05:12.710> I<00:05:13.069> keep<00:05:13.520> mine<00:05:13.789> on

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:13.819 
significantly boost it so I keep mine on

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:26.890 
significantly boost it so I keep mine on
regular<00:05:14.539> for<00:05:15.050> now

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.650 

this<00:05:27.530> computer<00:05:27.940> used<00:05:28.940> to<00:05:29.120> have<00:05:29.270> problems

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
this computer used to have problems

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.749 
this computer used to have problems
whenever<00:05:30.229> i<00:05:30.410> play<00:05:30.440> my<00:05:30.800> crops<00:05:31.100> like<00:05:31.370> it<00:05:31.580> would

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:31.759 
whenever i play my crops like it would

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:34.510 
whenever i play my crops like it would
skip<00:05:32.210> around<00:05:32.479> they'll<00:05:32.930> be<00:05:33.220> really<00:05:34.220> terrible

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
skip around they'll be really terrible

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.010 
skip around they'll be really terrible
frames<00:05:35.030> and<00:05:35.419> whatnot<00:05:35.780> but<00:05:36.199> now<00:05:37.070> hopefully<00:05:38.030> it

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
frames and whatnot but now hopefully it

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.909 
frames and whatnot but now hopefully it
won't<00:05:39.350> as<00:05:39.949> I<00:05:40.220> said<00:05:40.280> before<00:05:41.740> you<00:05:42.740> will

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 
won't as I said before you will

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:45.490 
won't as I said before you will
experience<00:05:43.400> like<00:05:43.550> at<00:05:43.789> the<00:05:43.910> first<00:05:44.120> part<00:05:44.419> as<00:05:44.630> you

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
experience like at the first part as you

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.830 
experience like at the first part as you
always<00:05:45.770> do<00:05:46.160> with<00:05:46.340> any<00:05:46.580> minecraft<00:05:46.940> load<00:05:49.840> note

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
always do with any minecraft load note

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.290 
always do with any minecraft load note
is<00:05:50.990> going<00:05:51.139> to<00:05:51.199> lag<00:05:51.380> a<00:05:51.410> lot<00:05:51.830> for<00:05:52.160> more<00:05:52.699> for<00:05:53.060> me

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
is going to lag a lot for more for me

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.080 
is going to lag a lot for more for me
because<00:05:53.840> i'm<00:05:54.410> running<00:05:54.860> camtasia<00:05:55.430> at<00:05:55.789> the<00:05:55.880> same

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
because i'm running camtasia at the same

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.810 
because i'm running camtasia at the same
time<00:05:56.350> so<00:05:57.350> i'm<00:05:57.440> just<00:05:57.500> going<00:05:57.889> to<00:05:57.979> go<00:05:58.070> to<00:05:58.190> this

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
time so i'm just going to go to this

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:04.750 
time so i'm just going to go to this
this<00:06:00.100> video<00:06:01.100> popping<00:06:01.460> off<00:06:02.530> articles<00:06:03.760> minimal

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
this video popping off articles minimal

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.820 
this video popping off articles minimal
and<00:06:05.860> i'll<00:06:06.860> put<00:06:07.070> it<00:06:07.190> on<00:06:07.280> tiny<00:06:08.169> it's<00:06:09.169> a<00:06:09.380> little

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
and i'll put it on tiny it's a little

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.980 
and i'll put it on tiny it's a little
better<00:06:09.970> but<00:06:10.970> i<00:06:11.060> mean<00:06:11.180> i'm<00:06:11.330> not<00:06:11.449> going<00:06:11.720> to<00:06:11.810> run

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
better but i mean i'm not going to run

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.629 
better but i mean i'm not going to run
this<00:06:12.289> while<00:06:12.680> i'm<00:06:12.919> running<00:06:13.220> camtasia

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:13.639 
this while i'm running camtasia

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:15.960 
this while i'm running camtasia
obviously<00:06:14.539> because<00:06:15.110> that<00:06:15.320> would<00:06:15.470> be<00:06:15.590> stupid

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:15.970 
obviously because that would be stupid

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.670 
obviously because that would be stupid
ok<00:06:16.970> that's<00:06:17.900> pretty<00:06:17.990> much<00:06:18.229> how<00:06:18.380> you<00:06:18.410> do<00:06:18.560> it

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680
