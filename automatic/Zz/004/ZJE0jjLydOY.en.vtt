00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:07.700
 the delegation arrived at the automakers 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.679
 colleges and won social networks 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.200
 victory in the Holy Spirit for 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.990
 world does not have a week to 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.990
 report was broadcast and Roberto already 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.710
 received more than a million and a half 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.269
 vehicle assemblers means scientists 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.060
 of federal universities 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.789
 energy companies and even researchers 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.850
 of the United States to contact 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.300
 everyone wants to get to know the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.430
 The secret of the water-powered car took 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.530
 surprise but I believe it will be a 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.390
 enormous benefit to the world and to the 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.450
 mainly Brazilian population kakÃ¡ 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.300
 suffered so much we need to know if these 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.730
 undergraduate engineering courses 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.520
 were amazed at the project that could 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.250
 be implanted in any vehicle, and 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.170
 I find it interesting because it 's a 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.390
 technology has helped many years 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.820
 documents in multinational companies and 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.750
 was stories and very simple the whole 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.869
 process 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.939
 we look and it seems he does more 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:11.250
 angola technology that can show a lot of 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.439
 thing has a non-combustible fuel source. 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.180
 pollutant for sure but the evolution in 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.460
 anywhere in the world is not much 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.210
 important that state and when the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.530
 capixaba roberto made an adaptation 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.049
 hydrogen generator so that the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.040
 device does not heat or causes 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.100
 explosion 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.220
 The mechanism separates the place of water and 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.350
 turns into fuel to prove 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.900
 this covered process channeled 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.119
 hydrogen through this way the 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.299
 balls in the water are gas molecules 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.210
 that in contact with a lighter promote 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:49.159
 small explosions similar to that 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.159
 happens all over the world the car 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.840
 the upgrading of equipment does not cause 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.750
 no modification of the original system 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.470
 of the vehicle with less than one liter of water 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.030
 covered about 2 thousand kilometers 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.710
 totally safe 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.080
 we do not have storage 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.050
 hydrogen in the car all hydrogen 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.120
 that is produced is consumed 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.950
 then this guy safer than a 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.810
 natural gas car that wants to follow the 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.959
 several reports that they 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.410
 can use water as fuel is 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.329
 an icon that many want in just 1 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.090
 h2o molecule 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:33.890
 are various gas particles that 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.890
 turns into fuel 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.849
 The objective is to contribute to society 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.010
 is to make this project go public domain 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.739
 for everyone to have all Brazilian 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.709
 I have the condition to have that I believe 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.480
 in your car and get out of those 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.560
 fuel that is absurd is that people 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.799
 see the truth in dream car play 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.959
 without gasoline already imagined by the automaker 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.989
 also promises to put on the market in 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.390
 September a car powered by hydrogen in 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.730
 roberto said that more news comes in 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.660
 soon to count on him 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.620
 note came at sign Esmaltec contact point 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.620
