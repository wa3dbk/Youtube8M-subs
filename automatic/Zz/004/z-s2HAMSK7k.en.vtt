00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.400 
straddle it and give it a really good
hit<00:02:35.880> right<00:02:36.180> on<00:02:36.239> its<00:02:36.480> weak<00:02:36.660> spot<00:02:36.690> right<00:02:37.110> here

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.500 

still<00:02:43.410> can't<00:02:43.650> break<00:02:43.830> through<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.190> fender<00:02:44.510> and

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
still can't break through the fender and

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.440 
still can't break through the fender and
it's<00:02:45.690> still<00:02:45.930> not<00:02:46.080> dented<00:02:46.530> now<00:02:47.310> again<00:02:47.910> the

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
it's still not dented now again the

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.150 
it's still not dented now again the
paint<00:02:48.660> would<00:02:48.810> be<00:02:48.930> scuffed<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.620> imagine<00:02:50.040> if

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
paint would be scuffed you imagine if

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.520 
paint would be scuffed you imagine if
this<00:02:50.280> was<00:02:50.459> in<00:02:50.580> a<00:02:50.640> bank<00:02:50.989> fast-food<00:02:51.989> restaurant

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
this was in a bank fast-food restaurant

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.309 
this was in a bank fast-food restaurant
and<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:53.400> hit<00:02:53.580> a<00:02:53.610> Ballard<00:02:54.000> like<00:02:54.569> this<00:02:54.810> or

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
and you hit a Ballard like this or

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.290 
and you hit a Ballard like this or
somebody<00:02:55.620> backed<00:02:55.950> into<00:02:56.160> your<00:02:56.370> car<00:02:56.580> or<00:02:56.760> your

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
somebody backed into your car or your

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.979 
somebody backed into your car or your
truck<00:02:58.130> you'd<00:02:59.130> lose<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.610> paint<00:02:59.870> then<00:03:00.870> we

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
truck you'd lose the paint then we

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.620 
truck you'd lose the paint then we
finally<00:03:01.260> finally<00:03:01.830> did<00:03:02.150> rupture<00:03:03.150> right<00:03:03.360> here

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
finally finally did rupture right here

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.070 
finally finally did rupture right here
on<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.870> last<00:03:04.080> one<00:03:04.340> again<00:03:05.390> not<00:03:06.390> a<00:03:06.420> full<00:03:06.690> rupture

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
on the last one again not a full rupture

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.020 
on the last one again not a full rupture
but<00:03:07.590> we<00:03:07.680> did<00:03:07.890> have<00:03:08.100> a<00:03:08.130> little<00:03:08.340> split<00:03:08.910> of

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
but we did have a little split of

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.600 
but we did have a little split of
occurrence<00:03:09.450> here<00:03:09.690> but<00:03:10.380> it's<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.650> two<00:03:10.950> hands<00:03:11.459> and

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
occurrence here but it's a two hands and

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.229 
occurrence here but it's a two hands and
a<00:03:12.269> softball<00:03:12.690> bat<00:03:12.959> for<00:03:13.799> that<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.100> happen<00:03:14.250> also

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
a softball bat for that to happen also

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.630 
a softball bat for that to happen also
when<00:03:15.840> it's<00:03:15.989> on<00:03:16.110> your<00:03:16.260> truck<00:03:16.530> there<00:03:17.070> is<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.340> wheel

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
when it's on your truck there is a wheel

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.180 
when it's on your truck there is a wheel
lining<00:03:18.030> up<00:03:18.120> under<00:03:18.360> here<00:03:18.600> that's<00:03:18.989> hard<00:03:19.320> and<00:03:19.470> so

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
lining up under here that's hard and so

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.009 
lining up under here that's hard and so
the<00:03:21.090> likelihood<00:03:21.299> that<00:03:21.600> this<00:03:21.810> would<00:03:21.989> occur

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
the likelihood that this would occur

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.380 
the likelihood that this would occur
when<00:03:22.709> it's<00:03:22.860> mounted<00:03:23.280> on<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.489> truck<00:03:23.730> is<00:03:23.940> very

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
when it's mounted on the truck is very

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.729 
when it's mounted on the truck is very
small<00:03:24.870> but<00:03:25.769> I'll<00:03:25.890> try<00:03:26.130> again<00:03:26.280> over<00:03:26.640> here<00:03:27.739> place

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
small but I'll try again over here place

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:39.680 
small but I'll try again over here place
right<00:03:29.010> here<00:03:29.220> ready<00:03:29.610> Maya<00:03:29.790> yep<00:03:38.329> cam<00:03:39.329> break<00:03:39.570> it

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
right here ready Maya yep cam break it

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.959 
right here ready Maya yep cam break it
there<00:03:40.549> this<00:03:41.549> concludes<00:03:42.030> our<00:03:42.209> first<00:03:42.480> test
