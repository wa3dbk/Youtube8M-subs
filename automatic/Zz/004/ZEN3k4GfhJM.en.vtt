00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
in between those either want to do left

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.499 
in between those either want to do left
or<00:01:35.719> right<00:01:35.959> on<00:01:36.109> your<00:01:36.200> joystick<00:01:36.709> but<00:01:37.389> after<00:01:38.389> you

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
or right on your joystick but after you

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.480 
or right on your joystick but after you
jump<00:01:38.810> in<00:01:38.929> the<00:01:39.020> air<00:01:39.170> you<00:01:39.409> hold<00:01:39.590> left<00:01:39.770> jump<00:01:40.219> and

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
jump in the air you hold left jump and

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.359 
jump in the air you hold left jump and
then<00:01:40.639> forward<00:01:42.099> then<00:01:43.099> left<00:01:43.369> or<00:01:43.520> right<00:01:43.639> again<00:01:43.909> so

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
then forward then left or right again so

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.769 
then forward then left or right again so
it's<00:01:46.369> a<00:01:46.459> little<00:01:46.639> complicated<00:01:46.969> I'd<00:01:47.389> say<00:01:47.599> just

00:01:47.769 --> 00:01:47.779 
it's a little complicated I'd say just

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:50.679 
it's a little complicated I'd say just
work<00:01:48.049> on<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:48.409> left<00:01:48.590> and<00:01:48.799> right<00:01:48.859> right<00:01:49.579> now<00:01:49.759> and

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
work on the left and right right now and

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.239 
work on the left and right right now and
then<00:01:50.779> once<00:01:51.049> you're<00:01:51.139> able<00:01:51.259> to<00:01:51.409> do<00:01:51.740> that<00:01:51.920> I

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:52.249 
then once you're able to do that I

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:54.099 
then once you're able to do that I
really<00:01:52.639> you<00:01:53.029> know<00:01:53.119> the<00:01:53.240> gun<00:01:53.389> that<00:01:53.630> Bob<00:01:53.869> and<00:01:54.049> you
