00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.240
 Y 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:27.240
 I had the opportunity to design policies 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.650
 in atlanta 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.779
 with politicians who want to put the 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.020
 next I want to compete again and the 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.850
 next were where practically 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.050
 it grew all where the games were born 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.239
 olympics those were my first 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.379
 Athenian and Beijing Olympics that 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.600
 they were the last olympic games 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.160
 truth and london now that for me it would be 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.200
 a rematch of everything is pretty 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.180
 was the year that gamma died in the 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.980
 conditions that we 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.079
 we expected 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.399
 let's say that physically he was very 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.530
 prepared but mentally I was 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.170
 enough snow was a lot of pressure 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.449
 media by other points that had 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.970
 what to do with my professional career outside 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.400
 of physical sports I never thought I was going to 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:10.330
 be doing on television and modeling 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.950
 in my campaign at first glance it can 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.900
 sound of what kind are distracting me 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.150
 Something else and that I can not 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.880
 dedicate but if one sees the table of 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.110
 athletes in Paraguay as you can see 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.880
 that with all my media career 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.390
 I have the best technical brand in Paraguay 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.030
 I can not dedicate 100% to sport 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.830
 because the other thing allows me to train myself 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.960
 I do not have enough support to 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.600
 dedicate myself 100% the sport I have 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.060
 friends in South America who are athletes who 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.070
 nowadays they are competing and that is a 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.649
 physical education teacher and I do not know 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.050
 can not dedicate 100% to the 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.490
 sports have to work but like my 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.229
 career I am not an education teacher 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.149
 physical you have to open a magazine and I 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.649
 you see me then it 's much easier 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.570
 say these girls taking pictures in 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.979
 place to be training I am a 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.200
 person who has to work like 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.240
 that most athletes 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.789
 paraguay you though the preparation 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.189
 for the Olympic Games it is almost a 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.479
 100% of your life given to the sport there 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.030
 artists that come to train three 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.500
 times per day in our case is with 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.110
 luck we trained four times by 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.640
 week twice a day but because 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.680
 a matter of credibility time 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.269
 of time for our work I think 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.610
 that for the next generations already 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.599
 they will touch something more organized 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.599
 unfortunately we did not get touched 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.760
 that from my part of heart and motivation 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.860
 and effort is all that I can give 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.230
 but without government support the 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.140
 trunks maybe now I do not bring a 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.599
 greater involvement but perhaps my medal 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.150
 olympic be the one that another athlete 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.720
 bring thanks to me help me and it 's that 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.720
 ambient
