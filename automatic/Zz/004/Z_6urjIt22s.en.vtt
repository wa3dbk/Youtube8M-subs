 health are back on the theme of today you 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.700
 You already know that we are not following people diets. 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.740
 crazy healthy diets before 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.029
 Intermission one question doctor alfredo 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.970
 almost answered proteins only proteins 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:25.070
 She really slims Mariana to the screen. 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.539
 myth or truth eat only protein 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.699
 working is not just protein 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.940
 When they say only protein is protein and 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:38.280
 fat is ultimately to eliminate 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.500
 carbohydrate makes weight loss does 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.870
 to lose weight more than other diets does 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.489
 short-term is shown in the long run. 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.640
 does not make a difference but keeps the 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.949
 generally not because the person does not 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.579
 Can you keep doing this all the time? 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:07.409
 carbohydrates are absolutely 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:10.229
 of the question is 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.119
 truth but a consequence without 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:17.759
 consequences because every time we 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:19.710
 we also speak of weight to the disease 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.740
 diet very rich in protein and fat 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.439
 by a subject who tends to 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.920
 for example up sclerosis or have the 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:32.130
 example cardiovascular diseases or have 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:36.890
 high cholesterol to do harm to a 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:40.560
 Related question, come on. 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.780
 in bauru in the interior of sÃ£o paulo did 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.060
 protein diet and I regained weight 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.100
 what are the risks of not eating 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:54.119
 carbohydrates 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:56.520
 I really want this direct because the 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.409
 Doctor Alfredo spoke is extremely 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.520
 the first power source of the 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:05.280
 brain and if you take them from the Lord 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.950
 from your diet, you're going to start trying, huh? 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.929
 that seek energy in another way and 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.879
 this form is toxic to the body over 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.440
 you can even feel a 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.000
 relief 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.240
 For a long time you are in pain. 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.650
 head calls for irritability concentration 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.420
 And as he said, there's nothing like you. 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.640
 keep for a long time confess that already 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.160
 I tried this diet once and stayed with 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.100
 a tpm that lasted a further 15 days 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.860
 irritated poisons eternal absurd 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.890
 in case of naomi de pennetta boring in 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.410
 Too much now only looks at carbohydrate 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.940
 new people a dish like this is the 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.510
 rose carbohydrate the main source of 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.800
 energy 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.010
 rice beans also have a little what 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.540
 So the rice mix is 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:56.430
 provides a very high amount of protein 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.410
 then it is good and tasty and is Brazilian and is 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.660
 The first program I will never forget 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.190
 I said how are they that I think 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.500
 Brazilian people are eating more rice 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:11.310
 beans will love fruit on top of the 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:15.180
 table also have carbohydrate noodles 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:18.330
 potato flour flour sugar all 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.200
 is carbohydrate myth or truth again 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:25.890
 here on the screen 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:28.830
 cha cha cha is curious the tea has a little 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.300
 quality of burning calories is then 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:36.180
 But shayma gracie is not that wonderful 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:38.010
 10 pounds at the base of the tea plus a tea 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.420
 helps burn calories tea has 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.989
 other properties 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.000
 it is an antioxidant, so there are 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:53.390
 work showing that tea can 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:53.390
 help prevent item 4 cups tea 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:16.769
 Truth be told, Mary and John prepare 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.870
 a tea for our production of 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:24.160
 before is a delight is that this is a 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.340
 movie that has already debuted xuxa 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.290
 lose weight but say calm is not 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.620
 I like the calm without sugar in the call 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:37.330
 preferably without the sweetener may in that 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:40.960
 2 to green tea white tea already black countries 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:43.390
 in dissent in his black and green 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.390
 to see which one does the most 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.010
 I thought what is more antioxidant the 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.620
 that burns more calories in my understanding 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.420
 both are similar 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.160
 It's an interesting thing you 're talking about. 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.080
 here diets that people do 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.920
 make crazy things to lose weight 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:03.700
 when and if the paranoia of 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:06.580
 to actually become a disease in the 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.710
 when a young woman was a 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.630
 It's a joke she dreams about food but 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.060
 actually when you think the time 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.740
 all in food and this occupies a 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.970
 much larger than the day it should 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.380
 occupy 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.420
 This may already start to worry. 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.980
 enough because it should not be this way. 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:26.190
 form 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:26.190
 so you're looking for a medical specialist 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.210
 It can be first the person she is 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.550
 making a diet 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:37.420
 Squid have to leave it aside and see if 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:39.610
 she usually thinks back to herself 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.860
 so do not think for sure you have to 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.820
 looking for someone to talk about is 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.140
 a curious thing also because 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.370
 usually when people stop 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.510
 think they want to lose weight 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:52.630
 I 'm more likely to lose weight, I guess. 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:55.720
 this placement is this suffering for 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:58.300
 to reduce this continuous thinking in 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:07.390
 food do very badly this is disease 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:10.990
 even with guilty edge is one that has 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:13.600
 guilty of coming back for what I think 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.250
 the points are good points allows 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.560
 you eat what you want 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.690
 the propaganda did not see it but it is a war 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.570
 and other diets that have re-education 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:26.320
 and allow you to start 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:28.750
 a chocolate beginning of the terms of 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:33.430
 mental re-education 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:35.830
 df regina only one winner made a 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:39.780
 question on the internet is free

 answering water is essential without water 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.850
 It is always important because I'm 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.980
 just saying and I already said the 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:54.370
 The first program is that some studies 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:57.340
 What water makes you lose weight of course not only 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:59.980
 You only drink water but do the same 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:02.890
 thing if you drink water mainly 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:04.420
 before meals two hours an hour 

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:06.970
