00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 know all the technology that you 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.599
 find volkswagen but not know 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.000
 exists this is the amarok highline 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:14.610
 automatic power and technology ever 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.369
 seen before on an off-road 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.189
 the luxury pickup of fusvag with a 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.470
 off-normal intelligence to overcome 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:29.880
 land where only strength is not enough 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:32.880
 Your 2.0-liter diesel 180-biturbo engine 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.410
 ensures more strength and power in 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.410
 any terrain 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.930
 the maximum torque is 42.8 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.070
 kilogram-meter strength and its capacity 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.500
 tow of 2.9 tonnes and for 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.719
 to face the obstacles that only the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.480
 is able to overcome the amarok 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.180
 exclusive off-road technologies 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.610
 already the attraction four by four 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.550
 permanent is the exclusivity of amarok it 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.199
 distributes the torque between the axes where 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.539
 when it is necessary 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.210
 another exclusive item is the exchange 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.890
 eight-speed automatic transmission with 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.020
 greater number of gears 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.659
 amarok knows how to better measure the quantity 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.350
 of strength in each situation 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.470
 in low speed situations idl 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.090
 electronic differential lock 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.159
 drives the wheel brake without traction 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.159
 avoiding that the truck skates 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.480
 already the electronic control of 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.330
 stability prevents loss of 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.490
 directional stability in curves or 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.220
 sudden changes in direction 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.270
 this technology adds the following 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.230
 functions 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.910
 the hs the wizard to match uphill 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:50.450
 prevents when starting up 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:53.120
 the vehicle shy and keeps the HDC 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.220
 constant speed up to 30 kilometers 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.680
 hours under critical conditions of 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.820
 decline in the truck without intervention 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.910
 driver 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.680
 the distributor EBD electronically 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.770
 braking force between the axles 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.240
 rear load depending on load 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.330
 transported 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.420
 amarok technology helps to overcome 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.540
 obstacles and provides more comfort 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.640
 the amarok steering wheel is multifunctional 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.890
 Do you have the command of the computer radio? 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.370
 board and telephone 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.130
 on the steering wheel and the GPS is integrated 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.800
 to the sound system 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.750
 the rear parking camera 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.090
 offers more comfort and safety in 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.760
 time to park and the 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.050
 amarok parking is also 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.510
 integrated into the radio 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.250
 besides sound signals are shown 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.220
 graphically on the display 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:50.600
 approaching obstacles by facilitating 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.880
 the maneuvers and how amarok is a car 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.190
 that surpasses any challenge 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.350
 security items provide more 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.470
 confidence when you are driving 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.690
 the emergency braking alert is 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.840
 when pressing the brake 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.040
 marked at speeds in excess of 60 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.530
 kilometers per hour 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.200
 immediately the taillights are 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.600
 and after braking and total 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.600
 warning light flashes on the vehicle. 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.540
 to improve performance. 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.030
 Traction control system 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.049
 reduces wheel slip during 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.540
 accelerating the abs braking system 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:32.260
 prevents the wheels from locking completely in the 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.859
 braking while avoiding skidding the function 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.739
 off road optimizes abs action 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:40.599
 especially on unpaved floors 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.579
 activated the abs slows its action 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.970
 allowing the wheel to lock 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:49.780
 instants before the abs act 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:52.810
 the rbs is the braking system under rain 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.900
 function eliminates formed water film 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.419
 the surfaces of the discs and pads 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.879
 security is further enhanced by 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:04.389
 dual bag for the driver and the 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:06.609
 passenger airbags of the chest and head 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.299
 side impacts ignite more 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:11.109
 strong 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:12.040
 the amarok is a strong pick-up to the 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:14.590
 Details 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.819
 intelligence is present in comfort 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.349
 inside 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.019
 infinit those that best guarantee 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:21.880
 such as the fixing of 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.150
 child seats in the rear seat 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.789
 but safety for your family 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.820
 the twilight sensor reads the 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:32.650
 incidence of light on 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.320
 the headlights and the 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.570
 rain perceives the intensity of the drops 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.190
 by activating the cleaners in the 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.550
 proper speed 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.620
 the amarok steering wheel can be adjusted from 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.979
 according to your need 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.750
 you operate the height and depth until 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:53.440
 find the most comfortable position 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.870
 to drive when the amarok is in a 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.659
 maneuver the fog lamp on the side 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.350
 internal curve turns on increasing the 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:02.770
 visibility 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:05.710
 part of the drivers all this added to the 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.530
 which is more modern and engineering makes 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.780
 from amarok the only pickup truck in the world off 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:14.160
 the road to using their intelligence to 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.160
 overcome your strength
