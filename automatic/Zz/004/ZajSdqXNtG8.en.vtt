00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
fairly decent at faceoffs in the game so

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.390 
fairly decent at faceoffs in the game so

about<00:01:33.479> him<00:01:33.630> as<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.869> can<00:01:34.049> tell<00:01:34.229> him<00:01:34.350> these

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
about him as you can tell him these

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.590 
about him as you can tell him these
clips<00:01:34.799> here<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.610> fact<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:35.939> he<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.270> really

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
clips here is the fact that he is really

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.749 
clips here is the fact that he is really
really<00:01:36.990> good<00:01:37.350> pot<00:01:37.680> control<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.340> he's<00:01:38.670> very

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
really good pot control and he's very

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.700 
really good pot control and he's very
very<00:01:39.240> strong<00:01:39.689> on<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> puck<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.380> hard<00:01:40.560> to

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
very strong on the puck and hard to

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.380 
very strong on the puck and hard to
knock<00:01:40.890> off<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.490> that's<00:01:41.909> probably<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
knock off it and that's probably the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.660 
knock off it and that's probably the
biggest<00:01:42.659> strength<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.619> him<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.100> he's<00:01:44.340> so

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
biggest strength of him is that he's so

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.789 
biggest strength of him is that he's so
hard<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.119> knock<00:01:45.360> off<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.750> puck<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.170> combine

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
hard to knock off the puck and combine

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.950 
hard to knock off the puck and combine
that<00:01:46.920> with<00:01:46.979> his<00:01:47.280> deacon<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.790> his<00:01:47.970> speed<00:01:48.329> yeah

acceleration<00:01:51.780> kind<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.259> hitting<00:01:52.409> that

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
acceleration kind of hitting that

off more of a two-way forward kind of

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.630 
off more of a two-way forward kind of
sense<00:02:50.990> to<00:02:51.200> me<00:02:51.320> as<00:02:51.500> opposed<00:02:51.920> to<00:02:52.160> mom<00:02:52.370> a

sense to me as opposed to mom a
playmaker<00:02:53.600> but<00:02:53.630> definitely<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.380> playmaker

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
playmaker but definitely the playmaker
