will look now let's show you the magic
of<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.810> technique<00:01:09.049> first<00:01:10.049> we're<00:01:10.229> going<00:01:10.320> to

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
of this technique first we're going to

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.710 
of this technique first we're going to
take<00:01:10.619> our<00:01:10.890> piece<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:11.580> have<00:01:11.790> ironed<00:01:12.540> our

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
take our piece that we have ironed our

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.850 
take our piece that we have ironed our
wax<00:01:12.990> paper<00:01:13.850> technique<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:18.650> we're<00:01:19.650> going<00:01:19.799> to

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
wax paper technique on we're going to

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.039 
wax paper technique on we're going to
take<00:01:20.070> our<00:01:20.310> ink<00:01:20.580> pad<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.360> we're<00:01:21.540> gonna<00:01:21.659> ink

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
take our ink pad and we're gonna ink

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.679 
take our ink pad and we're gonna ink
this<00:01:22.770> silk<00:01:23.430> sponge<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.210> you're<00:01:24.299> just<00:01:24.509> gonna

this silk sponge and you're just gonna

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.770 
this silk sponge and you're just gonna
go<00:01:24.990> into<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> swirling<00:01:26.040> motion<00:01:26.450> and<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.630> will

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
go into a swirling motion and you will

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.960 
go into a swirling motion and you will
see<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.320> there<00:01:28.650> are<00:01:28.680> places<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.759> ink

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
see that there are places that the ink

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.359 
see that there are places that the ink
sticks<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.840> places<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.799> ink<00:01:32.009> doesn't

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
sticks in places that the ink doesn't

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.030 
sticks in places that the ink doesn't
stick<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.420> that's<00:01:34.049> what's<00:01:34.350> gonna<00:01:34.560> give<00:01:34.860> us

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
stick and that's what's gonna give us

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.149 
stick and that's what's gonna give us
that<00:01:35.280> fun<00:01:38.630> background<00:01:39.630> design<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.650> we're

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
that fun background design that we're

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.840 
that fun background design that we're
looking<00:01:41.369> for<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.299> use<00:01:42.689> different

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
looking for and you can use different

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.210 
looking for and you can use different
designs<00:01:44.850> depending<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:45.930> which<00:01:46.470> project<00:01:47.130> you

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
designs depending on which project you

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.359 
designs depending on which project you
want<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.610> use<00:01:47.790> once<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.899> get<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.380> all<00:01:49.680> covered

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
want to use once I get this all covered

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.300 
want to use once I get this all covered
I<00:01:50.640> sometimes<00:01:51.090> wipe<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.960> off<00:01:52.140> with<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.860> little

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
I sometimes wipe it off with a little

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.630 
I sometimes wipe it off with a little
bit<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:54.030> tissue<00:01:54.799> just<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.950> take<00:01:56.189> off<00:01:56.399> the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
bit of a tissue just to take off the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.060 
bit of a tissue just to take off the
excess<00:01:56.790> ink<00:01:57.360> but<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.630> can<00:01:57.869> see<00:01:58.140> if<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:58.740> want<00:01:58.950> a

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
excess ink but you can see if you want a

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.039 
excess ink but you can see if you want a
little<00:01:59.280> darker<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.000> can<00:02:00.210> let<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.390> dry<00:02:00.689> and

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
little darker you can let it dry and

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:07.459 
little darker you can let it dry and
then<00:02:01.110> add<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> little<00:02:01.860> more<00:02:02.040> ink<00:02:06.200> now<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.380> we

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
then add a little more ink now that we

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.460 
then add a little more ink now that we
have<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.799> piece<00:02:08.129> finished<00:02:08.989> we're<00:02:09.989> going<00:02:10.200> to

have that piece finished we're going to

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.940 
have that piece finished we're going to
adhere<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.280> our<00:02:11.400> tan

you<00:06:22.070> can<00:06:22.640> never<00:06:22.850> have<00:06:23.120> too<00:06:23.330> many<00:06:23.450> dimensionals

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.260 
you can never have too many dimensionals

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260 
you can never have too many dimensionals
sometimes<00:06:24.800> too<00:06:25.130> safe<00:06:25.400> because<00:06:25.730> I<00:06:25.850> like<00:06:26.060> to<00:06:26.240> use

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
sometimes too safe because I like to use

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.110 
sometimes too safe because I like to use
so<00:06:26.630> many<00:06:26.780> of<00:06:27.020> them<00:06:27.140> I<00:06:27.320> put<00:06:27.590> one<00:06:28.400> in<00:06:28.550> each<00:06:28.670> corner

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
so many of them I put one in each corner

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.210 
so many of them I put one in each corner
and<00:06:29.390> that<00:06:29.510> balances<00:06:30.260> it<00:06:30.440> out<00:06:30.530> when<00:06:30.800> you<00:06:30.890> put<00:06:31.130> it
