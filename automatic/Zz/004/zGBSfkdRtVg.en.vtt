00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
kind of going around as an anti tank or

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.290 
kind of going around as an anti tank or
now<00:00:13.799> as<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:13.980> sniper<00:00:15.560> the<00:00:16.609> anti<00:00:17.609> sniping

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
now as a sniper the anti sniping

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.359 
now as a sniper the anti sniping
capability<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.199> sniper<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.920> move<00:00:20.130> is

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
capability of the sniper and move is

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.220 
capability of the sniper and move is
just<00:00:20.779> insurmountable

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.529 

that's<00:00:25.230> not<00:00:25.410> bad<00:00:25.590> against<00:00:26.090> crawling<00:00:27.090> targets

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
that's not bad against crawling targets

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.630 
that's not bad against crawling targets
either<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:28.050> think<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.859> guy<00:00:29.039> was<00:00:29.220> moving

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
either I think that guy was moving

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.240 
either I think that guy was moving
around<00:00:29.730> toward<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.599> ammo<00:00:31.500> crate<00:00:31.769> over<00:00:31.949> there

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
around toward the ammo crate over there

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.940 
around toward the ammo crate over there
see<00:00:33.239> if<00:00:33.270> he<00:00:33.450> just<00:00:33.630> had<00:00:33.870> three<00:00:34.260> grenades<00:00:34.530> he

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
see if he just had three grenades he

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.400 
see if he just had three grenades he
could<00:00:35.130> easily<00:00:35.489> kill<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.239> artillery<00:00:36.870> piece<00:00:37.170> we

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
could easily kill the artillery piece we

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.100 
could easily kill the artillery piece we
had<00:00:37.940> but<00:00:38.940> I'm<00:00:39.090> assuming<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.629> he<00:00:39.870> had<00:00:39.930> already

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
had but I'm assuming that he had already

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.720 
had but I'm assuming that he had already
used<00:00:40.410> up<00:00:40.620> all<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.860> his<00:00:40.950> grenades<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.520> he<00:00:41.610> was

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
used up all of his grenades and he was

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.520 
used up all of his grenades and he was
trying<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.180> be<00:00:42.329> sly<00:00:42.600> about<00:00:42.899> getting<00:00:43.200> over<00:00:43.410> the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
to the Americans so you know all that

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.190

stuff<00:02:03.190> I<00:02:03.310> said<00:02:03.340> earlier<00:02:04.000> about<00:02:04.030> you<00:02:04.720> get<00:02:04.930> stuck

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
stuff I said earlier about you get stuck

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.930

on<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.500> losing<00:02:05.860> team<00:02:05.890> just<00:02:06.399> because<00:02:06.729> of<00:02:06.880> the

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
on the losing team just because of the

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.790 
on the losing team just because of the
statistics<00:02:07.660> and<00:02:07.810> people<00:02:08.200> leaving<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.590> team

now<00:02:09.009> I<00:02:09.039> think<00:02:09.220> it<00:02:09.459> actually<00:02:09.580> is<00:02:09.850> to<00:02:10.270> curse<00:02:10.539> I've

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
now I think it actually is to curse I've

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.820 
now I think it actually is to curse I've
been<00:02:11.280> somehow<00:02:12.280> managed<00:02:15.959> but<00:02:16.959> no<00:02:17.170> actually<00:02:17.650> in

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
been somehow managed but no actually in

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.040 
been somehow managed but no actually in
seriousness<00:02:18.430> it<00:02:18.850> that<00:02:19.060> would<00:02:19.180> be<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.360> auto

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
seriousness it that would be the auto

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.479 
seriousness it that would be the auto
balance<00:02:20.800> feature<00:02:21.510> which<00:02:23.100> only<00:02:24.100> a<00:02:24.220> lot<00:02:24.400> of
