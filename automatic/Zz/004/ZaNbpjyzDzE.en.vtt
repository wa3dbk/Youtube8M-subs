 It is from the setting of the mother 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:05.319
 Radio and network 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.590
 Mobile network is open because 30 communications are disconnected 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.790
 Here 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:14.230
 Enable data communication 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:17.380
 It's said that you'll dance by removing the check 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:22.040
 But it is bye-bye in 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.060

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.230
 It is a touch because there is a meeting 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.410
 In this way 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.360
 As Mr. Ibaraki comes out 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.550

 I'm sorry I'm sorry until the security lamp blinks 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:12.190
 The store is 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:16.440
 Automatically 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.440
 It will be in the form of establishing a radio 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:28.700
 I guess it's a bit hard to see aoss Set security and connect properly 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.800
 It is completed that we did 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.220
 After this already 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.290
 that 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.290
 It takes the form of being connected to the Internet 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.490
 youtube 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:05:00.800
 Well this is 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:03.990
 Connect to the internet in a wi-fi environment with youtube and that 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.710
 In the situation where you can search the internet 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:13.180
 It will be easy 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:13.180
 It's strange, but the last word is easy , but I would like to excuse
