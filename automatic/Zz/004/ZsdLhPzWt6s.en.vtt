00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
because it's such a constant process

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.629

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
like a base of operations but it's

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.969 
like a base of operations but it's
mostly<00:04:42.910> just<00:04:43.030> empty<00:04:43.539> space<00:04:43.870> with<00:04:44.229> some<00:04:44.380> NPCs
