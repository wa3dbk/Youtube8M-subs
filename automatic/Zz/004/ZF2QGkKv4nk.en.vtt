I'll<00:00:32.009> go<00:00:32.099> over<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.309> pros<00:00:32.489> first<00:00:32.850> it's<00:00:33.420> kind<00:00:33.870> of

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
I'll go over the pros first it's kind of

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.630 
I'll go over the pros first it's kind of
difficult<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.530> run<00:00:34.680> out<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.890> arrows<00:00:35.160> which<00:00:35.520> is

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
difficult to run out of arrows which is

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.040 
difficult to run out of arrows which is
one<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.969> best<00:00:36.210> things<00:00:36.329> about<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.840> class

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
one of the best things about this class

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.910 
one of the best things about this class
you<00:00:38.010> get<00:00:38.190> three<00:00:38.489> every<00:00:39.270> every<00:00:39.570> minute<00:00:39.920> which

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
you get three every every minute which

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.040 
you get three every every minute which
basically<00:00:41.160> means<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.750> you<00:00:42.750> know<00:00:42.870> you've<00:00:43.020> got

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
basically means that you know you've got

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.840 
basically means that you know you've got
infinite<00:00:43.680> arrows<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.100> mean<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.340> possible<00:00:44.789> to

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
infinite arrows I mean it is possible to

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.490 
infinite arrows I mean it is possible to
run<00:00:45.059> out<00:00:45.180> but<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.660> kind<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:45.989> difficult<00:00:46.170> if

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
run out but it's kind of difficult if

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.049 
run out but it's kind of difficult if
you're<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.710> pvp<00:00:47.070> situation<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.760> want<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.969> be
