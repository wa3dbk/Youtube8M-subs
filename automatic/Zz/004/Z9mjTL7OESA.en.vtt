00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
is a lot more difficult to use and to

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.270 
is a lot more difficult to use and to
put<00:00:53.579> together<00:00:53.730> than<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> lego<00:00:54.870> playset<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:56.010> just

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
put together than a lego playset it just

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.010 
put together than a lego playset it just
doesn't<00:00:56.610> seem<00:00:56.760> like<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.090> snaps<00:00:57.360> together<00:00:57.600> as
