00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
foresight all on cooldown so I'm going

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.760 
foresight all on cooldown so I'm going
to<00:01:13.030> demonstrate<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.450> macro<00:01:14.720> right<00:01:14.900> now<00:01:15.050> just

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
to demonstrate the macro right now just

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.220 
to demonstrate the macro right now just
activated<00:01:16.430> it<00:01:16.520> just<00:01:17.090> gave<00:01:17.270> us<00:01:17.450> keen<00:01:17.840> flurry

again rampart and activate it one more

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.820 
again rampart and activate it one more
time<00:01:24.980> for<00:01:25.870> foresight<00:01:26.870> so<00:01:27.110> as<00:01:27.350> you<00:01:27.440> can<00:01:27.560> see<00:01:27.680> the

keeps feather foot rampart and foresight

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.030 
keeps feather foot rampart and foresight
on<00:02:00.920> cooldown<00:02:01.160> and<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:02.090> healing<00:02:02.480> macro<00:02:03.040> will

on cooldown and the healing macro will
cast<00:02:04.510> convalescence<00:02:05.510> and<00:02:05.750> second<00:02:06.650> wind

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
cast convalescence and second wind

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.649 
cast convalescence and second wind
okay<00:02:09.280> notice<00:02:09.489> that<00:02:09.700> I<00:02:09.819> am<00:02:09.970> taking<00:02:10.360> a<00:02:10.420> little

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:10.659 
okay notice that I am taking a little

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:15.050 
okay notice that I am taking a little
bit<00:02:10.780> of<00:02:10.899> damage<00:02:12.390> so<00:02:13.390> I'm<00:02:13.540> going<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:13.920> activate

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
bit of damage so I'm going to activate

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.330 
bit of damage so I'm going to activate
the<00:02:16.060> healing<00:02:16.540> macro<00:02:16.870> when<00:02:17.019> I<00:02:17.079> hit<00:02:17.260> about<00:02:17.470> 50%

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
the healing macro when I hit about 50%

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.640 
the healing macro when I hit about 50%
health<00:02:19.439> okay

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
health okay

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.339 
health okay
I'm<00:02:20.769> going<00:02:20.950> to<00:02:21.040> activate<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:21.610> healing<00:02:21.939> macro

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
I'm going to activate the healing macro

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.800 
I'm going to activate the healing macro
ass<00:02:23.349> convalescence<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:24.540> then<00:02:25.540> it<00:02:25.629> just

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
ass convalescence and then it just

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.880 
ass convalescence and then it just
healed<00:02:26.079> me<00:02:26.489> so<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:27.670> macro<00:02:27.849> is<00:02:28.150> working<00:02:28.890> by

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
healed me so the macro is working by

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.670 
healed me so the macro is working by
casting<00:02:30.519> convalescence<00:02:31.390> before<00:02:32.019> a<00:02:32.049> second

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
casting convalescence before a second

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.800 
casting convalescence before a second
wind<00:02:32.890> it<00:02:33.069> makes<00:02:33.280> your<00:02:33.400> second<00:02:33.879> wind<00:02:34.090> heal<00:02:34.480> a

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
wind it makes your second wind heal a

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.599 
wind it makes your second wind heal a
little<00:02:35.049> bit<00:02:35.140> more<00:02:35.290> powerful<00:02:38.340> let's<00:02:39.340> now<00:02:39.459> move

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:39.609 
little bit more powerful let's now move

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:42.899 
little bit more powerful let's now move
on<00:02:39.819> to<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.269> third<00:02:40.690> variation<00:02:41.310> this<00:02:42.310> variation

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
on to the third variation this variation

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.259 
on to the third variation this variation
of<00:02:43.000> macros<00:02:43.450> is<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.930> most<00:02:44.139> healing<00:02:44.440> centric

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
of macros is the most healing centric

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.629 
of macros is the most healing centric
the<00:02:46.269> defense<00:02:46.629> of<00:02:46.810> macro<00:02:47.200> is<00:02:47.349> smaller<00:02:47.769> and<00:02:48.220> the

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:48.639 
the defense of macro is smaller and the

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:51.690 
the defense of macro is smaller and the
healing<00:02:49.060> macro<00:02:49.510> makes<00:02:50.079> use<00:02:50.349> of<00:02:50.700> bloodbath

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
healing macro makes use of bloodbath

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.349 
healing macro makes use of bloodbath
which<00:02:52.420> causes<00:02:52.959> your<00:02:53.109> attacks<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.769> heal<00:02:54.040> you

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
which causes your attacks to heal you

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.270 
which causes your attacks to heal you
the<00:02:55.359> macro<00:02:55.750> would<00:02:55.930> probably<00:02:56.470> work<00:02:56.620> better<00:02:56.680> if

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
the macro would probably work better if

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.210 
the macro would probably work better if
you<00:02:57.609> proceed<00:02:58.239> using<00:02:59.079> the<00:02:59.170> healing<00:02:59.439> macro<00:03:00.010> with

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
you proceed using the healing macro with

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.809 
you proceed using the healing macro with
a<00:03:00.250> cast<00:03:00.549> a<00:03:00.819> fight<00:03:01.060> or<00:03:01.239> flight<00:03:02.459> okay<00:03:03.459> so<00:03:03.519> what

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
a cast a fight or flight okay so what

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.550 
a cast a fight or flight okay so what
I'm<00:03:03.909> going<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.180> do<00:03:04.389> is<00:03:04.629> pull<00:03:04.900> a<00:03:04.930> bunch<00:03:05.170> of<00:03:05.290> mobs

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
I'm going to do is pull a bunch of mobs

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.129 
I'm going to do is pull a bunch of mobs
and<00:03:06.010> try<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:06.849> get<00:03:07.030> my<00:03:07.150> health<00:03:07.450> down<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:07.959> about<00:03:08.079> a

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:08.139 
and try to get my health down to about a

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:10.649 
and try to get my health down to about a
little<00:03:08.230> 50%<00:03:09.129> actually<00:03:10.000> we'll<00:03:10.239> just<00:03:10.420> stand

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659 
little 50% actually we'll just stand

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:12.000 
little 50% actually we'll just stand
here<00:03:10.750> okay<00:03:10.989> we're<00:03:11.290> now<00:03:11.530> we're<00:03:11.680> going<00:03:11.799> to

here okay we're now we're going to
activate<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.669> healing<00:03:13.120> macro<00:03:13.540> just<00:03:13.810> cast

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
activate the healing macro just cast

I<00:03:16.810> also<00:03:17.410> activated<00:03:18.220> fight-or-flight<00:03:19.079> and<00:03:21.060> a

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
I also activated fight-or-flight and a

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.300 
I also activated fight-or-flight and a
defensive<00:03:22.629> macro<00:03:24.540> so<00:03:25.540> as<00:03:25.750> I<00:03:25.989> DPS<00:03:26.680> it'll<00:03:27.099> heal

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
defensive macro so as I DPS it'll heal

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.750 
defensive macro so as I DPS it'll heal

let's<00:03:33.760> now<00:03:33.879> cover<00:03:34.150> a<00:03:34.269> useful<00:03:34.870> DPS<00:03:35.470> macro<00:03:36.069> that

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
let's now cover a useful DPS macro that

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.119 
let's now cover a useful DPS macro that
you<00:03:36.549> can<00:03:36.699> use<00:03:36.909> when<00:03:37.120> tanking<00:03:37.859> the<00:03:38.859> first

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
you can use when tanking the first

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:40.979 
you can use when tanking the first
couple<00:03:39.519> lines<00:03:39.639> of<00:03:39.879> the<00:03:39.940> macro<00:03:40.329> caused<00:03:40.629> you<00:03:40.840> to

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
couple lines of the macro caused you to

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.439 
couple lines of the macro caused you to
face<00:03:41.379> your<00:03:41.409> current<00:03:42.040> target<00:03:42.250> and<00:03:42.609> begin<00:03:43.120> Auto

of melee range notice that at cast
shield<00:04:18.820> lob<00:04:19.320> so<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:20.500> macro<00:04:20.650> is<00:04:20.949> working<00:04:21.370> and

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
shield lob so the macro is working and

shield lob so the macro is working and
that's<00:04:23.650> all<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:24.040> macros<00:04:24.280> we're<00:04:24.729> going<00:04:24.910> to<00:04:25.000> be
