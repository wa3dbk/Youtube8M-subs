00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
all right mark so this is how I did the

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.320 
all right mark so this is how I did the
seafoam<00:00:03.149> in<00:00:03.449> my<00:00:03.720> bike<00:00:03.929> my<00:00:04.500> gold<00:00:04.710> wing<00:00:04.920> I<00:00:05.330> took

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
seafoam in my bike my gold wing I took

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.350 
seafoam in my bike my gold wing I took
off<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:09.320> hose<00:00:10.320> that<00:00:11.010> goes<00:00:11.280> it<00:00:11.519> feeds<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.330> the

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
off the hose that goes it feeds to the

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.440 
off the hose that goes it feeds to the
carburetors<00:00:13.259> from<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.530> petcock<00:00:13.920> I<00:00:14.450> pulled

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
carburetors from the petcock I pulled

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.349 
carburetors from the petcock I pulled
that<00:00:15.570> off<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:16.080> then<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.100> have<00:00:17.369> this<00:00:17.609> little

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
that off and then I have this little

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.920 
that off and then I have this little
deal<00:00:18.690> from<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.189> oil<00:00:20.189> can<00:00:20.510> put<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:21.779> there

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
deal from a oil can put that in there

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.450 
deal from a oil can put that in there
using<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.350> as<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.470> funnel<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.240> then<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.570> just

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
using it as a funnel and then I just

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.730 
using it as a funnel and then I just
with<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.550> bike<00:00:26.760> running<00:00:27.470> poured<00:00:28.470> that

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
with the bike running poured that

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.139 
with the bike running poured that
seafoam<00:00:29.539> into<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.660> into<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.529> top<00:00:32.059> while<00:00:33.059> it

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
seafoam into the into the top while it

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:33.620 
seafoam into the into the top while it
was<00:00:33.239> running

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
was running

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.110 
was running
and<00:00:33.750> then<00:00:34.649> just<00:00:34.950> drizzled<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.610> there<00:00:35.880> and

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
and then just drizzled it in there and

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.510 
and then just drizzled it in there and
it<00:00:36.270> went<00:00:37.079> in<00:00:37.170> there<00:00:37.350> for<00:00:37.559> quite<00:00:37.739> aways<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.010> mean

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
it went in there for quite aways I mean

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.930 
it went in there for quite aways I mean
I<00:00:38.730> put<00:00:39.600> probably<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> third<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.739> can<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
I put probably a third of a can of the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.510 
I put probably a third of a can of the
seafoam<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.570> there<00:00:42.899> as<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.890> was<00:00:44.010> running<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.899> I

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
seafoam in there as it was running and I

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.860 
seafoam in there as it was running and I
had<00:00:47.520> mom<00:00:47.730> operating<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.300> throttle<00:00:48.629> keeping

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
had mom operating the throttle keeping

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.680 
had mom operating the throttle keeping
it<00:00:48.960> running<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.379> then<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.489> started<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.480> smoke

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
it running and then it started to smoke

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.069 
it running and then it started to smoke
a<00:00:51.899> little<00:00:52.110> bit<00:00:52.230> out<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.500> pipe<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.100> then<00:00:54.079> mom

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
a little bit out to pipe and then mom

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.840 
a little bit out to pipe and then mom
was<00:00:55.260> keeping<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.620> revved<00:00:55.829> up<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.280> guess<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.699> could

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
was keeping it revved up I guess I could

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.360 
was keeping it revved up I guess I could
have<00:00:56.910> adjusted<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.480> throttle<00:00:57.840> anyway<00:00:58.170> but<00:00:58.440> I

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
have adjusted the throttle anyway but I

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.560 
have adjusted the throttle anyway but I
had<00:00:59.969> her<00:01:00.149> do<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:02.870> let<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.989> run<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.409> then

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
had her do it so I let it run and then

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.960 
had her do it so I let it run and then
it<00:01:06.570> started<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.590> smoke<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.799> little<00:01:08.010> bit<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.460> she

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
it started to smoke a little bit and she

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.810 
it started to smoke a little bit and she
was<00:01:09.119> running<00:01:09.270> at<00:01:09.479> about<00:01:09.720> 1,500<00:01:10.710> 2,000<00:01:11.220> rpms<00:01:11.640> to

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
was running at about 1,500 2,000 rpms to

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.260 
was running at about 1,500 2,000 rpms to
keep<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.090> idle<00:01:12.330> up<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.830> then<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.950> finally

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
keep the idle up and then it finally

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.609 
keep the idle up and then it finally
started<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.360> spit<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.720> sputter<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.110> bog<00:01:16.350> down

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
started to spit and sputter and bog down

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.609 
started to spit and sputter and bog down
I<00:01:17.060> didn't<00:01:18.060> wait<00:01:18.180> for<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.630> die<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:19.140> mean<00:01:19.439> I

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
I didn't wait for it to die I mean I

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.870 
I didn't wait for it to die I mean I
guess<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:19.979> did<00:01:20.189> once<00:01:20.400> she<00:01:20.520> let<00:01:20.670> off<00:01:20.759> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
guess I did once she let off the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.780 
guess I did once she let off the
throttle<00:01:21.170> it<00:01:22.170> died<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.159> then<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.280> coughed<00:01:23.580> and

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
throttle it died and then it coughed and

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.020 
throttle it died and then it coughed and
spitted<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.270> sputtered<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.920> kind<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.070> over

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
spitted and sputtered and kind of over

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.140 
spitted and sputtered and kind of over
ran<00:01:27.439> but<00:01:29.360> so<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.390> did<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.680> right<00:01:32.640> now<00:01:32.670> as

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
ran but so I did that and right now as

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.050 
ran but so I did that and right now as
it<00:01:33.720> went<00:01:33.869> through<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.200> fuel<00:01:34.470> line<00:01:34.740> all<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.970> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
it went through the fuel line all of the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.950 
it went through the fuel line all of the
float<00:01:36.299> bowls<00:01:36.799> should<00:01:37.799> be<00:01:38.240> full<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.509> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
float bowls should be full of the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.830 
float bowls should be full of the
carburetor<00:01:40.229> should<00:01:40.530> be<00:01:40.619> full<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.100> seafoam

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
carburetor should be full of the seafoam

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.960 
carburetor should be full of the seafoam
so<00:01:42.950> I'll<00:01:43.950> let<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.189> sit<00:01:44.579> overnight

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
so I'll let that sit overnight

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.730 
so I'll let that sit overnight
