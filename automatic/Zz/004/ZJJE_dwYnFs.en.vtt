00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.349
 this time I bring you this video of 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.150
 curiosities of the star fox saga since 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.130
 I did not know what to do a video and this 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.849
 was the first thing that occurred to me x 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.730
 I hope you like good start in 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.500
 the sleeve of starfox 64 the motto of 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.980
 team is all for one and one for 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.260
 everyone 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.900
 this is a reference to the three 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.850
 musketeers the main inspiration of 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.500
 miyamoto to use animals came to him 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.359
 because he was not interested in using 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.460
 robots or monsters as in others 

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:41.530
 sci- fi products 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.600
 falco and partridge were designed as a 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.420
 bird and a hare given the inspiration 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.519
 of the drawings of Japanese folklore the 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.710
 general pp of clubs were designed 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.780
 like a dog and a monkey of preference 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.600
 the Japanese phrase fight like dogs and 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.760
 motorcycles the star fox although in the first 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.670
 mission the planet we are going to is called 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.579
 fortune and in the star fox of the nintendo 64 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.830
 we're also going to this planet just that 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.720
 is covered with snow which is about 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.570
 of a translation error because in the 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.610
 star fox 64 is the planet should be called 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.120
 pichina but it was translated badly 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.040
 called fortune in starfox 64 the voices of 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.740
 the characters are digitized by 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.990
 real people with dialogues that support 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.690
 history this novelty has influenced 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.510
 other 3d towns like starcraft and world 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.120
 of warcraft starfox adventure is was 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.400
 initially planned for nintendo 64 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.350
 with the name of dinosaur planet a 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.320
 game that would not be part of the saga of 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.660
 star fox insurance shigeru miyamoto la 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.520
 decision to transform planet dinosaur 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.770
 in a game of the star fox saga it 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.869
 gave to be so similar the designs of 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.900
 the main characters with the design 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.910
 of fox mccloud starfox adventure after 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.680
 the last game that would relaunch as 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.810
 nintendo company since the egg 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.110
 rare would be bought as a developer 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.119
 of games for teachers in starfox 64 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.910
 that if he tells the fox to do wrong 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.300
 roll barrel roll the funny thing is that 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.860
 that maneuver is actually called turns 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.989
 well this is very well known but since 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.580
 there are many believe that fox and others 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.480
 team members using you 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.100
 silver 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.720
 but actually they run 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.650
 the legs so that the blood does not 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.220
 it comes in its 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.770
 brains for the forces that 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.020
 well that has been all I'm sorry if the 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.180
 video was very short what happens is that 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.400
 it's hard to find little curios 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.780
 known do not forget to like me and if 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.780
