 You can build a video with a friend 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:43.489
 game control options and 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:47.579
 also the controller is the author 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:50.670
 on find the game I tower somehow detailed 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:54.090
 there is a battle to the death there is an arms race 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.380
 and there is an object destruction and static 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.670
 there is usually a classic 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:03.170
 competitive battle of us is the same to 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.170
 gray ks16 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:11.400
 the arms race is the same book 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:15.750
 from 516 further goes about stretching the object 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:19.799
 this is a normal server with probably 16 only 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:22.250
 without which both hostages and only 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.440
 the destruction of the object here that is the bomb 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.990
 terrorists to lay the bond classically 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:32.280
 it's usually the very same classic ordinary 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:34.650
 in our part, the source is not 10 well 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.419
 there is a section you can play with messina 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.200

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.310
 Next comes the classic 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:51.450
 competitive 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:55.950
 since the tour that there are cards you can 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:05:02.910
 choose which one when searching go away what 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:06.780
 It was and remove that was not so that's how 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:11.120
