I'm gonna show you how easy it is to
create<00:00:03.600> something<00:00:04.170> just<00:00:04.200> like<00:00:04.560> this<00:00:05.960> what

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
create something just like this what

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.709 
create something just like this what
you'll<00:00:07.109> need<00:00:09.800> is<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:10.860> rectangle<00:00:11.460> glass<00:00:11.730> that

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
you'll need is a rectangle glass that

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.480 
you'll need is a rectangle glass that
fits<00:00:12.929> perfectly<00:00:13.410> into<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.309> Nunn<00:00:14.460> design

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
fits perfectly into the Nunn design

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.230

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
first step we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.220 
first step we're gonna do is we're gonna
go<00:00:29.220> ahead<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.660> trim<00:00:30.660> out<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:32.090> section<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.960> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
go ahead and trim out a section of the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.130 
go ahead and trim out a section of the
collage<00:00:34.530> sheet<00:00:35.510> you<00:00:36.510> don't<00:00:36.719> have<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.989> worry

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
collage sheet you don't have to worry

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.690 
collage sheet you don't have to worry
about<00:00:37.260> being<00:00:37.530> exact<00:00:38.010> I'm<00:00:38.250> just<00:00:38.430> gonna<00:00:38.579> go

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
about being exact I'm just gonna go

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.170 
about being exact I'm just gonna go
ahead<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:38.969> just<00:00:39.239> cut<00:00:39.540> out<00:00:39.860> my<00:00:40.860> name<00:00:41.180> image

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
ahead and just cut out my name image

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.090 
ahead and just cut out my name image
like<00:00:42.510> such<00:00:43.940> Nunn<00:00:44.940> design<00:00:45.239> glue<00:00:46.100> is

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
like such Nunn design glue is

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.139 
like such Nunn design glue is
silicon-based

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
silicon-based

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.420 
silicon-based
instead<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.510> water-based<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.950> doesn't<00:00:50.250> add

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
instead of water-based so it doesn't add

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.830 
instead of water-based so it doesn't add
a<00:00:50.489> lot<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:51.000> extra<00:00:51.210> moisture<00:00:52.190> into<00:00:53.190> your<00:00:53.399> piece

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
a lot of extra moisture into your piece

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.090 
a lot of extra moisture into your piece
which<00:00:54.840> can<00:00:55.110> discolor<00:00:55.649> or<00:00:56.280> run<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.059> inks<00:00:58.100> so

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
which can discolor or run the inks so

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.010 
which can discolor or run the inks so
I'm<00:00:59.280> painting<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.969> thin<00:01:00.180> coat<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.840> Nunn

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
I'm painting a thin coat of the Nunn

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.750 
I'm painting a thin coat of the Nunn
design<00:01:01.050> glue<00:01:01.379> right<00:01:02.039> on<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.670> back<00:01:02.910> part<00:01:03.660> of

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
design glue right on to the back part of

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.960 
design glue right on to the back part of
the<00:01:05.760> glass<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:07.040> why<00:01:08.040> I'm<00:01:08.189> doing<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.610> as<00:01:08.820> I

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
the glass and why I'm doing this as I

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.250 
the glass and why I'm doing this as I
have<00:01:09.000> found<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.860> if<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:11.100> paint<00:01:11.720> if<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.900> put<00:01:13.140> this

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
have found that if I paint if I put this

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.880 
have found that if I paint if I put this
into<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:14.180> Patera<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.509> then<00:01:16.320> press<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.710> glass

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
into the Patera and then press the glass

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.130 
into the Patera and then press the glass
down<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.549> tend<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.240> get<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.420> lot<00:01:18.659> more<00:01:18.900> air

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
down I tend to get a lot more air

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.789 
down I tend to get a lot more air
bubbles<00:01:20.240> so<00:01:21.240> now<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.570> have<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:22.170> thin<00:01:22.439> coat

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
bubbles so now that I have a thin coat

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.640 
bubbles so now that I have a thin coat
of<00:01:22.830> an<00:01:23.490> undesigned<00:01:24.030> glue<00:01:24.350> I'm<00:01:25.350> going<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.560> go

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
of an undesigned glue I'm going to go

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:33.310 
of an undesigned glue I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.540> press<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.750> onto<00:01:29.030> my<00:01:30.030> collage<00:01:30.450> you

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.819 

then<00:01:34.320> I'm<00:01:34.439> gonna<00:01:34.590> pick<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:34.890> up<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.720> I<00:01:36.829> squeeze

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
then I'm gonna pick it up and I squeeze

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.359 
then I'm gonna pick it up and I squeeze
out<00:01:38.750> any<00:01:39.750> excess<00:01:40.470> glue<00:01:40.790> by<00:01:41.790> kind<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.090> going

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
out any excess glue by kind of going

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.270 
out any excess glue by kind of going
back<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.610> forth<00:01:44.909> until<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:46.590> glue<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:46.860> kind<00:01:47.220> of

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
back and forth until the glue is kind of

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.990 
back and forth until the glue is kind of
squished<00:01:47.670> out<00:01:47.850> at<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.149> sides

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.750 

then<00:01:52.630> once<00:01:52.840> that's<00:01:53.110> dried<00:01:53.560> you're<00:01:54.460> gonna<00:01:54.580> go

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
then once that's dried you're gonna go

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.560 
then once that's dried you're gonna go
back<00:01:54.970> in<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:56.500> the<00:01:56.860> edges<00:01:57.310> and<00:01:57.580> trim<00:01:58.150> away<00:01:58.270> that

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
back in to the edges and trim away that

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.850 
back in to the edges and trim away that
excess<00:02:00.690> so<00:02:01.690> I<00:02:01.720> went<00:02:01.900> ahead<00:02:01.990> and<00:02:02.530> trimmed<00:02:02.680> away

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
excess so I went ahead and trimmed away

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:10.710 
excess so I went ahead and trimmed away
that<00:02:03.220> excess<00:02:03.790> around<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.810> edges<00:02:09.119> so<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.270> blue

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
that excess around the edges so the blue

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.720 
that excess around the edges so the blue
will<00:02:10.869> be<00:02:10.899> milky<00:02:11.410> white<00:02:11.620> at<00:02:11.890> first<00:02:12.250> but<00:02:12.610> it

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
will be milky white at first but it

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.880 
will be milky white at first but it
dries<00:02:13.000> clear<00:02:13.360> within<00:02:14.170> two<00:02:14.500> hours<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:17.140> paint<00:02:17.620> a

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
dries clear within two hours the paint a

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.760 
dries clear within two hours the paint a
thin<00:02:18.100> coat<00:02:18.400> of<00:02:18.430> a<00:02:19.120> nun<00:02:19.300> design<00:02:19.630> glue<00:02:19.840> onto<00:02:20.350> the
