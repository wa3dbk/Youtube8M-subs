water<00:02:56.140> is<00:02:56.290> completely<00:02:56.950> gone

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
water is completely gone

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.120 
water is completely gone
so<00:02:58.510> you<00:02:58.570> put<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.110> right<00:02:59.260> amount<00:02:59.530> of<00:02:59.590> water<00:02:59.770> in
