00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:16.049
 [music] 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.990
 so dear friends call me tyapkin 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.650
 igor i'm fond of canvas there order 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.100
 eight years old 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.010
 I find this occupation very attractive 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.980
 Today I want to tell you about the flies 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.090
 that work on different types 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.980
 ponds on different fish in different 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.620
 season in general 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.360
 conditions the next class of flies which 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.260
 we'll touch it 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.930
 flies the so-called wet talk about 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.640
 that what exactly they imitate 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.790
 Well, to be honest, it does not have to be because 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.070
 that they mimic everything and nothing 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:58.470
 at the same time it is purely fantasy 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.940
 flies silhouette of the so -called flies as 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.510
 I have already said it is not clear that they 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.369
 imitate what fish find in them but if 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.369
 you and I could get in the head with a fish 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.810
 and understand what she wants but we ca n't 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.960
 do this here therefore explain 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.060
 why fish pecks impossible i mean 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.909
 You can think a lot about what can 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.829
 be imitation 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.109
 dragonfly larvae and there is something somewhere 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.810
 may remind but nonetheless fact 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:31.380
 fantasy fly 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.479
 and virtually nothing imitates the 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.579
 However, this does not prevent them from being very 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.100
 successful and catchy 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.770
 baits now let's say such a fly as 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.039
 mother is brown that is martovskaya 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.649
 brown hard to say why she 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.909
 got that name 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:51.359
 I can tell you that she works 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.969
 almost all year and march 

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:56.100
 it has nothing to do with it 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:02:00.179
 very successful and I personally caught 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.999
 on this fly let's say she is very fee 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:08.810
 well kleval fit this fly on 

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:12.930
 hook for flies and consists of 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.580
 brown feather tail 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.400
 colors 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.510
 body brown dubbing beard 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.810
 also a cock feather of the same color 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:28.620
 winding can be copper wire 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.020
 and actually wing it should be 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.810
 brown it can be 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.290
 swatch on for example from moss krylov 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.209
 what's on 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.580
 as in this case or it may be 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.800
 turkey that is important to keep here 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.270
 overall tone it should be brown 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.419
 all the same 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.419
 [music] 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.579
 the next fly is identical 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:01.030
 practically fit the previous but 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:04.670
 connected in gray tones i can say that 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.860
 in ancient times one caretaker 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.510
 British lakes said about 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.280
 the next is that your fly can be 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.940
 any color as long as it is gray 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.220
 so here it is the sight of sulfur 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.989
 works great in light water in 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:24.079
 dark water is not clear that it mimics 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:27.620
 but nevertheless very catchy bait 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:30.799
 and the next wet fly may well 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.019
 imitate the little fish that is something 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.540
 little red 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:38.769
 something sharp there imitation scales on 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:43.340
 some here it may be quite 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.720
 perceived fish as fry here the difference 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.430
 with previous 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:52.940
 in that the tail is made from feather beads with 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:04:00.079
 golden pheasant's mane wing made on 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:04:03.440
 may be from the drake from the collapse ola decided 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:08.389
 teal tail that is the contrast on 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:11.329
 black white feather and feather feathers of a rooster 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:14.720
 painted blue body just 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:17.830
 silver lyrics are just brilliant body 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.830
 [music] 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.010
 the next class of flies that I want you 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.820
 imagine this imitation of the water stage 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.640
 development 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:36.160
 insects which angler very often 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:40.240
 meet reservoirs it can be 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:43.520
 dragonfly mayflies 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:46.600
 mosquitoes and brook Nicky 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:53.660
 here is a fly that I want to present to you 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:58.690
 This is an imitation of a botterical larvae 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:06.250
 she heathen tail which means 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:09.200
 pheasant tail, it is on the idea of ​​the author 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:12.740
 was supposed to knit using 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:15.110
 only pen hunting pheasant but with 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:20.390
 Over time, it turned out that the 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:21.340
 rex was replaced feather tail feather 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.230
 peacock 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:28.430
 these are three exactly the same flies 100 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:30.860
 the only difference is that I made two 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.440
 golden heads what is 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:37.910
 both weighting element and 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:39.920
 attract attention and size 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:43.760
 actually the size that is necessary here 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:46.130
 say that each insect has its own 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:50.030
 a set of parameters of some kind and color 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:52.430
 this size and the closer we are to our 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:56.210
 imitations get closer to the natural 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:06:00.710
 the prototype will be more accurate bite 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:03.440
 This fly is tied on not a background hook tail 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:09.800
 as i said feather beads 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:13.610
 The hunting pheasant's body is also the same 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.910
 little feathers of hunting pheasant this one 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:20.320
 wing cover 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:24.530
 also the same feathers and only torex it 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.630
 peacock feather barbs and body winding 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.570
 it can be either slender lurex 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:32.040
 either copper wire and to say that 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.380
 this is one of the most successful to have 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.150
 fathers who are already very many years and 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:39.230
 that works and all knit it and 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.230
 fine not and catch 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:52.890
