00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.079
 to unlock the super vegeta 2 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.150
 that he is much better than the ssid the 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.130
 super saiyajin two super sayen of 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.020
 calls as you want super cm2 which at 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.660
 passage you can even buy it at 100000 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.940
 genius it's not huge like price 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.440
 it's not huge, it's not excessive, you see 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.149
 but me personally I am a guy 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.640
 of the old school and jabeur unlock 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.989
 but just but even and of 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.640
 transformation but super fun especially 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.960
 like a healthy guy type and the 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.539
 kill everything you have to do 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.820
 select mission 38 in the 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.230
 parallel quests so you go in the 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.519
 parallel quests be it offline 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.710
 or online personally I tell you 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.449
 still recommend doing it in 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.309
 solo because you will have a lot more 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.079
 chances of getting it because if you 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.760
 did it online with friends it's 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.980
 can it be one of the friends he 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.570
 is and that you are not ok for 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.490
 I personally unlock them in 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.200
 livestream I was with a friend 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.430
 but hey I still got to 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.900
 pass that's not quality 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.550
 livestream in the end i'll show you 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.900
 how did I get in livestream 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.970
 personally I shot this video 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.070
 offline to be able to explain the 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.070
 steps correctly and quietly 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.020
 so you select the misson 38 launches 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.020
 the super genkidama you see precisely 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:34.160
 in the east in the famous awards 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.720
 there is the super vegeta 2 comment 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.570
 to unblock it here we are at 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.610
 very early precisely from the house you go 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.430
 must dismount beautiful children so 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.690
 the ultimate bull the strongest if you want it 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.360
 do important let him not kill 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.830
 sangoku and try to rush a maximum 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.420
 by taking characters that are 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.400
 extremely strong me personally 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.860
 I took brulis and plants if I say 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.180
 no bullshit here and what will happen 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.470
 to pass is that actually when he goes 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.300
 to reach everything at the end you are going to us 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.380
 take it off almost all his life where goes all 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.240
 time keep a crumb 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.740
 do not worry it's not a bug it's 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.110
 just that goku value launched the super 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.030
 genkidama after which normally he gets 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.469
 may this be the end and 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.000
 possibly is related to what we 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:11.659
 calls random events on 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.260
 green xenon 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:15.420
 he may get up 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.879
 it becomes evil end you have 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.590
 a lot more chances if kids toddler 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.959
 turns into evil mud he 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.700
 you have to kill him again and prevent him from 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.409
 prevent them from killing his Goku to know 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.810
 who will come back very often near goku 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.549
 to kill him you do that 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.049
 tries to beat and kills him again 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.150
 and does not have much more chance of 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.739
 unlock the super vegeta 2 it's 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.870
 extremely simple there is no 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.700
 difficulties normally I forgot to 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.620
 tell you that at half of his life boils 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.450
 when you already take away half of his 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.769
 life in vaiges state that just gave a 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.530
 little help so that's 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.010
 always a little trick 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.470
 what can you do 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.230
 eventually you can get it without 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.000
 same as end does not change without even 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.980
 that tip does turn into beautiful 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.750
 beautiful you can get what has been 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.209
 my case I was extremely lucky 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.980
 friends it means that we had beautiful 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.579
 directly from the first shot in a few 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.530
 moments 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.909
 the mission lasted I think three minutes 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.159
 and half if I say no bullshit and 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.120
 I had my super vegeta two very 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.030
 easy to get 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.670

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.560

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.720
 quality precisely with the rebroadcast 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.790

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.889
 it bug slightly you'll see that I have 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.470
 actually got live 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:26.849
 do not pay attention to the quality there 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.079
 buggy that's why I did not dare 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.090

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.430
