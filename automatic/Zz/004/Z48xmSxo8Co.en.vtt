first<00:00:15.790> understand<00:00:16.330> the<00:00:16.480> brain<00:00:16.750> its<00:00:17.170> parts<00:00:17.650> and

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 
first understand the brain its parts and

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.540 
first understand the brain its parts and
what<00:00:18.250> they<00:00:18.400> do<00:00:18.460> our<00:00:19.420> brain<00:00:19.930> is<00:00:20.200> the<00:00:20.440> most

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
what they do our brain is the most

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.790 
what they do our brain is the most
complicated<00:00:21.550> organ<00:00:22.000> of<00:00:22.360> our<00:00:22.480> body<00:00:22.540> it<00:00:23.050> has

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
complicated organ of our body it has

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.339 
complicated organ of our body it has
three<00:00:24.189> major<00:00:24.490> parts<00:00:25.000> the<00:00:25.630> cerebellum

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
three major parts the cerebellum

three major parts the cerebellum
cerebrum<00:00:27.310> and<00:00:27.430> brain<00:00:28.180> stem<00:00:28.540> which<00:00:29.230> is<00:00:29.410> also

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
cerebrum and brain stem which is also

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.760 
cerebrum and brain stem which is also
known<00:00:29.920> as<00:00:30.130> the<00:00:30.340> medulla<00:00:30.790> the<00:00:31.320> cerebrum<00:00:32.320> is<00:00:32.500> the

known as the medulla the cerebrum is the

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.340 
known as the medulla the cerebrum is the
biggest<00:00:33.310> part<00:00:33.670> of<00:00:33.790> the<00:00:33.940> brain<00:00:34.180> it<00:00:34.810> controls

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
biggest part of the brain it controls

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.400 
biggest part of the brain it controls
our<00:00:35.560> senses<00:00:36.190> our<00:00:36.630> imagination<00:00:37.630> and<00:00:37.810> our

our senses our imagination and our

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.729 
our senses our imagination and our

the<00:00:45.880> cerebrum<00:00:46.480> the<00:00:46.950> second<00:00:47.950> major<00:00:48.160> part<00:00:48.550> is

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
the cerebrum the second major part is

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.630 
the cerebrum the second major part is
the<00:00:49.060> cerebellum<00:00:49.600> it<00:00:49.990> is<00:00:50.590> known<00:00:50.800> as<00:00:51.010> the<00:00:51.310> little

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
the cerebellum it is known as the little

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.750 
the cerebellum it is known as the little
brain<00:00:51.880> it<00:00:52.600> controls<00:00:53.140> our<00:00:53.260> motion<00:00:53.800> balance<00:00:54.550> and

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
brain it controls our motion balance and

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.870 
brain it controls our motion balance and
our<00:00:55.390> ability<00:00:55.840> to<00:00:56.050> learn<00:00:56.260> new<00:00:56.320> things<00:00:56.980> for

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 
our ability to learn new things for

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.060 
our ability to learn new things for
example<00:00:58.000> you<00:00:58.480> can<00:00:59.110> walk<00:00:59.410> without<00:00:59.650> falling

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
example you can walk without falling

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.780 
example you can walk without falling
because<00:01:00.640> of<00:01:00.970> the<00:01:01.270> cerebellum<00:01:01.990> also<00:01:02.950> it<00:01:03.250> helps

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
because of the cerebellum also it helps

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.870 
because of the cerebellum also it helps
with<00:01:04.000> learning<00:01:04.269> any<00:01:04.809> new<00:01:04.930> thing<00:01:05.579> the<00:01:06.579> third

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
with learning any new thing the third

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.420 
with learning any new thing the third
major<00:01:07.150> part<00:01:07.570> is<00:01:07.780> the<00:01:08.079> medulla<00:01:08.500> it<00:01:09.040> is<00:01:09.250> also

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
major part is the medulla it is also

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.170 
major part is the medulla it is also
known<00:01:09.820> as<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.450> brain<00:01:10.780> stem<00:01:11.579> it<00:01:12.579> does<00:01:12.850> a<00:01:12.880> few

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
known as the brain stem it does a few

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.170 
known as the brain stem it does a few
things<00:01:13.240> which<00:01:13.930> are<00:01:14.110> called<00:01:14.350> involuntary

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
things which are called involuntary

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.120 
things which are called involuntary
actions<00:01:16.180> it<00:01:16.900> controls<00:01:17.439> our<00:01:17.619> digestion

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
actions it controls our digestion

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.239 
actions it controls our digestion
heartbeat<00:01:19.119> and<00:01:19.299> breathing<00:01:19.929> these<00:01:20.890> things

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:21.249 
heartbeat and breathing these things

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:23.609 
heartbeat and breathing these things
happen<00:01:21.700> automatically<00:01:22.539> in<00:01:22.659> our<00:01:22.810> body<00:01:23.020> we

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
happen automatically in our body we

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.609 
happen automatically in our body we
don't<00:01:23.799> have<00:01:23.950> to<00:01:24.100> put<00:01:24.280> any<00:01:24.460> effort<00:01:24.700> here<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:26.409> now

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
don't have to put any effort here so now

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.859 
don't have to put any effort here so now
you<00:01:26.679> know<00:01:27.130> about<00:01:27.159> the<00:01:27.490> brain<00:01:27.850> can<00:01:28.749> you

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
you know about the brain can you

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.219 
you know about the brain can you
remember<00:01:29.170> it<00:01:29.350> all<00:01:29.560> good<00:01:30.369> the<00:01:31.210> cerebrum<00:01:31.869> is<00:01:32.049> in

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
remember it all good the cerebrum is in

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.319 
remember it all good the cerebrum is in
charge<00:01:32.530> of<00:01:32.619> sensing<00:01:33.340> thinking<00:01:34.119> and

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
charge of sensing thinking and

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.539 
charge of sensing thinking and
imagination<00:01:35.159> Wow

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
imagination Wow

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.819 
imagination Wow
you're<00:01:36.729> right<00:01:36.939> the<00:01:37.450> cerebellum<00:01:38.139> is<00:01:38.259> also

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
you're right the cerebellum is also

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:40.499 
you're right the cerebellum is also
responsible<00:01:39.369> for<00:01:39.520> muscle<00:01:39.850> movement<00:01:40.389> and

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
responsible for muscle movement and

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.639 
responsible for muscle movement and
control<00:01:40.719> and<00:01:41.259> it<00:01:41.889> also<00:01:42.130> helps<00:01:42.609> us<00:01:42.729> in<00:01:42.939> learning

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
control and it also helps us in learning

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.289 
control and it also helps us in learning
great<00:01:44.649> you're<00:01:45.249> right<00:01:45.490> about<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:45.880> medulla

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
great you're right about the medulla

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.779 
great you're right about the medulla
also<00:01:46.719> it<00:01:47.109> is<00:01:47.319> running<00:01:47.709> our<00:01:47.920> body<00:01:48.249> from<00:01:48.639> the

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
also it is running our body from the

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.149 
also it is running our body from the
