00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.770 
more I'm wanting a lot more long range
gunfights<00:01:14.549> because<00:01:14.970> I'm<00:01:15.090> able<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.390> control<00:01:15.630> my

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
gunfights because I'm able to control my

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.039 
gunfights because I'm able to control my
recoil<00:01:16.290> with<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.159> four<00:01:17.670> grid<00:01:17.990> now<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
recoil with the four grid now the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.719 
recoil with the four grid now the
foregrip<00:01:19.470> does<00:01:19.740> increase<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.400> spread<00:01:20.700> of

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
foregrip does increase the spread of

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.420 
foregrip does increase the spread of
your<00:01:20.850> weapon<00:01:21.330> but<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.900> heavy<00:01:22.080> barrel<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.680> must

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
your weapon but the heavy barrel I must

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.100 
your weapon but the heavy barrel I must
add<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.640> little<00:01:23.880> bit<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.119> accuracy<00:01:24.570> even<00:01:24.720> though

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
add a little bit of accuracy even though

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.950 
add a little bit of accuracy even though
it<00:01:25.229> does<00:01:25.380> add<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.619> recoil<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.610> what<00:01:27.270> not<00:01:27.509> only<00:01:27.810> do

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
it does add a recoil on what not only do

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.109 
it does add a recoil on what not only do
you<00:01:27.990> get<00:01:28.200> for<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.500> recoil<00:01:28.950> but<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.670> do<00:01:29.880> get

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
you get for that recoil but you do get

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.630 
you get for that recoil but you do get
an<00:01:30.270> increased<00:01:30.840> our<00:01:31.110> damage<00:01:31.860> over<00:01:32.130> long<00:01:32.340> range

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
an increased our damage over long range

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.550 
an increased our damage over long range
so<00:01:33.030> if<00:01:33.150> your<00:01:33.299> damage<00:01:33.570> drop<00:01:33.840> off<00:01:33.990> minimum<00:01:34.409> is

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
so if your damage drop off minimum is

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.920 
so if your damage drop off minimum is
like<00:01:34.740> 17<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.850> will<00:01:36.030> boost<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.450> up<00:01:36.509> another

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
like 17 it will boost it up another

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.050 
like 17 it will boost it up another
point<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.530> half<00:01:37.740> or<00:01:38.070> two<00:01:38.100> points<00:01:38.759> or<00:01:38.850> so

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
point and a half or two points or so

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.730 
point and a half or two points or so
which<00:01:39.570> allow<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.110> kill<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.650> I'll

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
which allow you to kill and I'll

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.179 
which allow you to kill and I'll
probably<00:01:41.460> one<00:01:41.850> less<00:01:42.060> bullet<00:01:42.680> or<00:01:43.680> sometimes

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
probably one less bullet or sometimes

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.649 
probably one less bullet or sometimes
you<00:01:44.310> get<00:01:44.430> those<00:01:44.579> kills<00:01:44.880> that'd<00:01:45.060> be<00:01:45.270> like<00:01:45.450> one

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
you get those kills that'd be like one

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.300 
you get those kills that'd be like one
percent<00:01:46.049> don't<00:01:46.259> have<00:01:46.350> one<00:01:46.530> percent<00:01:46.890> left<00:01:47.100> or

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
percent don't have one percent left or

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.120 
percent don't have one percent left or
two<00:01:47.670> percent<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.329> he'll<00:01:49.079> kill<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.799> is

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
two percent and he'll kill you and is

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.010 
two percent and he'll kill you and is
that's<00:01:50.340> because<00:01:50.729> he's<00:01:51.540> probably<00:01:51.689> got<00:01:51.990> a

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
that's because he's probably got a

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.950 
that's because he's probably got a
greater<00:01:52.380> damage<00:01:52.649> over<00:01:53.159> distance<00:01:53.579> now<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.180> AEK

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
greater damage over distance now the AEK

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.770 
greater damage over distance now the AEK
fires<00:01:55.369> 950<00:01:56.369> rounds<00:01:56.549> per<00:01:56.880> minute<00:01:57.090> that's

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
fires 950 rounds per minute that's

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.389 
fires 950 rounds per minute that's
almost<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.229> thousand<00:01:58.590> rounds<00:01:58.710> per<00:01:58.920> minute<00:01:59.040> that

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
almost a thousand rounds per minute that

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.270 
almost a thousand rounds per minute that
is<00:01:59.670> crazy<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.479> can<00:02:00.630> beat<00:02:00.810> shotguns<00:02:01.350> up<00:02:01.829> hopes

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
is crazy you can beat shotguns up hopes

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.179 
is crazy you can beat shotguns up hopes

and<00:02:05.430> for<00:02:06.149> medium<00:02:06.509> range<00:02:06.780> you're<00:02:07.380> shredding

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
and for medium range you're shredding

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.800

through<00:02:07.979> your<00:02:08.099> enemies<00:02:08.399> literally<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.330> mean

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
it's crazy how powerful this gun is and

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.250

out for you try this weapon I set up it
definitely<00:02:38.750> works<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.350> for<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.800> foregrip

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
definitely works the for the foregrip

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.390 
definitely works the for the foregrip
Cobra<00:02:40.850> site<00:02:41.090> and<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.660> heavy<00:02:41.870> barrel<00:02:42.400> all

Cobra site and the heavy barrel all
these<00:02:43.700> attachments<00:02:44.360> they<00:02:44.570> work<00:02:44.870> for<00:02:45.500> a<00:02:45.560> medium

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
these attachments they work for a medium

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.760 
these attachments they work for a medium
long<00:02:46.400> range<00:02:46.820> and<00:02:47.120> even<00:02:47.780> shorter<00:02:48.170> our<00:02:48.380> short

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
long range and even shorter our short

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.650 
long range and even shorter our short
range<00:02:48.980> and<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.940> reason<00:02:50.180> for<00:02:50.210> this<00:02:50.420> is<00:02:50.630> because

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
range and the reason for this is because

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.060 
range and the reason for this is because
like<00:02:51.020> I<00:02:51.110> said<00:02:51.170> long<00:02:51.500> range<00:02:51.710> you're<00:02:51.860> going<00:02:51.980> to

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
like I said long range you're going to

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.630 
like I said long range you're going to
get<00:02:52.160> that<00:02:52.340> one<00:02:52.640> one<00:02:53.270> and<00:02:53.300> a<00:02:53.450> half<00:02:53.480> or<00:02:53.930> two<00:02:53.960> point

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
get that one one and a half or two point

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.680 
get that one one and a half or two point
damage<00:02:55.640> increase<00:02:56.000> for<00:02:56.210> your<00:02:56.330> minimum

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
damage increase for your minimum

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.690 
damage increase for your minimum
drop-off<00:02:57.230> damage<00:02:57.710> so<00:02:57.890> that<00:02:58.040> means<00:02:58.220> even<00:02:58.610> if

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
drop-off damage so that means even if

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.060 
drop-off damage so that means even if
you're<00:02:58.850> using<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.900> foregrip<00:03:00.770> with<00:03:00.980> the

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
you're using the foregrip with the

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.390 
you're using the foregrip with the
silencer<00:03:01.580> um<00:03:02.740> you're<00:03:03.740> still<00:03:04.040> going<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.280> be

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
silencer um you're still going to be

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.550 
silencer um you're still going to be
able<00:03:04.430> to<00:03:04.790> do<00:03:04.940> well<00:03:05.180> on<00:03:05.480> what<00:03:06.260> you're<00:03:06.350> still

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
able to do well on what you're still

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.630 
able to do well on what you're still
going<00:03:06.680> to<00:03:06.710> be<00:03:06.830> able<00:03:06.860> to<00:03:07.040> put<00:03:07.190> down<00:03:07.340> enough

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
going to be able to put down enough

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.310 
going to be able to put down enough
shots<00:03:07.880> on<00:03:08.210> down<00:03:08.390> range<00:03:08.630> especially<00:03:08.780> with<00:03:09.230> the

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
shots on down range especially with the

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.670 
shots on down range especially with the
AEK<00:03:10.270> if<00:03:11.270> I<00:03:11.510> so<00:03:11.810> fast<00:03:12.110> that<00:03:12.230> if<00:03:12.410> you<00:03:12.500> use<00:03:12.650> the

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
AEK if I so fast that if you use the

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.310 
AEK if I so fast that if you use the
sensor<00:03:13.220> with<00:03:13.340> this<00:03:13.460> gun<00:03:13.640> um<00:03:14.050> you're<00:03:15.050> gonna<00:03:15.110> get

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
sensor with this gun um you're gonna get

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.080 
sensor with this gun um you're gonna get
that<00:03:15.380> advantage<00:03:15.680> to<00:03:16.310> keep<00:03:16.459> us<00:03:16.640> stay<00:03:16.820> off<00:03:16.970> the

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
that advantage to keep us stay off the

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.240 
that advantage to keep us stay off the
radar<00:03:17.300> and<00:03:17.690> you're<00:03:18.620> going<00:03:18.709> to<00:03:18.800> be<00:03:18.890> able<00:03:18.920> to<00:03:19.130> put

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
radar and you're going to be able to put

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.010 
radar and you're going to be able to put
enough<00:03:19.550> shots<00:03:19.850> down<00:03:20.180> range<00:03:20.480> to<00:03:20.720> kill<00:03:20.840> your

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
enough shots down range to kill your

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.600 
enough shots down range to kill your
enemy<00:03:21.350> that<00:03:21.590> you<00:03:21.830> might<00:03:22.160> not<00:03:22.340> need<00:03:22.550> that

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
enemy that you might not need that

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.910 
enemy that you might not need that
bullet<00:03:23.209> you<00:03:23.510> might<00:03:23.690> not<00:03:23.870> be<00:03:24.500> thinking<00:03:24.890> that

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
bullet you might not be thinking that

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.530 
bullet you might not be thinking that
you<00:03:25.130> need<00:03:25.310> that<00:03:25.459> extra<00:03:25.700> bullet<00:03:26.060> to<00:03:26.180> kill<00:03:26.209> your

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
you need that extra bullet to kill your

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.510 
you need that extra bullet to kill your
enemy<00:03:26.870> and<00:03:27.050> the<00:03:27.739> reason<00:03:27.920> for<00:03:28.070> that<00:03:28.280> is<00:03:28.489> because

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
enemy and the reason for that is because

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.490 
enemy and the reason for that is because
those<00:03:28.880> 950<00:03:29.630> rounds<00:03:29.780> per<00:03:29.959> minute<00:03:30.080> if<00:03:30.290> you<00:03:30.350> could

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
those 950 rounds per minute if you could

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.800 
those 950 rounds per minute if you could
put<00:03:30.620> those<00:03:30.739> down<00:03:30.980> accurately<00:03:31.610> enough<00:03:32.090> to<00:03:32.630> hit

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
put those down accurately enough to hit

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.270 
put those down accurately enough to hit
your<00:03:32.989> target<00:03:33.350> and<00:03:33.440> aim<00:03:33.709> for<00:03:33.739> center<00:03:34.130> mass

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
your target and aim for center mass

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.040 
your target and aim for center mass
especially<00:03:35.060> if<00:03:35.150> you're<00:03:35.270> using<00:03:35.300> the<00:03:35.660> sensor

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
especially if you're using the sensor

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.020 
especially if you're using the sensor
always<00:03:36.739> aim<00:03:36.950> for<00:03:36.980> center<00:03:37.310> mass<00:03:37.459> because<00:03:37.910> if

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
always aim for center mass because if

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.340 
always aim for center mass because if
you're<00:03:38.150> going<00:03:38.239> to<00:03:38.300> aim<00:03:38.540> for<00:03:38.570> the<00:03:38.870> head<00:03:39.050> shot

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
you're going to aim for the head shot

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.140 
you're going to aim for the head shot
they're<00:03:40.310> going<00:03:40.430> to<00:03:40.489> be<00:03:40.550> less<00:03:40.730> accurate

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
they're going to be less accurate

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.479 
they're going to be less accurate
especially<00:03:41.300> with<00:03:41.660> the<00:03:41.750> recoil<00:03:42.170> arm<00:03:42.440> added<00:03:43.280> to

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
especially with the recoil arm added to

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.330 
especially with the recoil arm added to
the<00:03:43.610> suppressor<00:03:44.120> post<00:03:44.630> patch<00:03:45.070> you're<00:03:46.070> not

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
the suppressor post patch you're not

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.740 
the suppressor post patch you're not

going to get that killed so center mass
is<00:03:47.930> highly<00:03:48.230> recommended<00:03:48.830> now<00:03:49.250> if<00:03:49.340> you're

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.430 
is highly recommended now if you're
using<00:03:49.610> the<00:03:49.730> heavy<00:03:49.940> barrel<00:03:50.180> arm<00:03:50.510> and<00:03:51.350> you're

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440

not<00:03:51.620> using<00:03:51.800> the<00:03:51.950> foregrip<00:03:52.340> it's<00:03:52.940> gonna

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
not using the foregrip it's gonna

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.680 
not using the foregrip it's gonna
increase<00:03:53.600> your<00:03:53.750> accuracy<00:03:54.440> by<00:03:54.950> a<00:03:54.980> ton<00:03:55.520> and<00:03:55.790> when

I say a ton if you aim for those
headshots<00:03:58.310> you're<00:03:58.730> going<00:03:58.940> to<00:03:59.060> get<00:03:59.150> those

using on the AEK or another class setup
I've<00:04:04.610> tried<00:04:04.850> it<00:04:05.090> but<00:04:05.239> it<00:04:05.360> doesn't<00:04:05.690> really<00:04:05.810> work

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
I've tried it but it doesn't really work

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.960 
I've tried it but it doesn't really work
so<00:04:06.410> much<00:04:06.560> for<00:04:06.769> the<00:04:06.830> long-range<00:04:07.250> butts<00:04:07.820> the

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
so much for the long-range butts the

so much for the long-range butts the
foregrip<00:04:08.420> silencer<00:04:09.019> and<00:04:09.170> I<00:04:10.160> don't<00:04:10.790> know<00:04:10.910> what

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
foregrip silencer and I don't know what

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.030 
foregrip silencer and I don't know what
it<00:04:11.209> does<00:04:11.390> exactly<00:04:11.720> but<00:04:12.050> it<00:04:12.140> makes<00:04:12.350> me<00:04:12.440> move<00:04:12.890> a

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
it does exactly but it makes me move a

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.350 
it does exactly but it makes me move a
little<00:04:13.160> bit<00:04:13.250> faster<00:04:13.430> if<00:04:13.670> it<00:04:13.790> was<00:04:13.880> like<00:04:14.000> I<00:04:14.120> move

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
little bit faster if it was like I move

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.930 
little bit faster if it was like I move
a<00:04:14.390> little<00:04:14.600> bit<00:04:14.720> faster<00:04:14.959> smoother<00:04:15.709> on<00:04:15.950> it<00:04:16.580> helps

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
a little bit faster smoother on it helps

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.729 
a little bit faster smoother on it helps
me<00:04:17.060> escape<00:04:17.419> from<00:04:17.959> long<00:04:18.200> range<00:04:18.230> gunfights

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
me escape from long range gunfights

me escape from long range gunfights
which<00:04:19.160> is<00:04:19.310> a<00:04:19.340> good<00:04:19.549> thing<00:04:19.609> because<00:04:19.880> you're<00:04:20.150> not

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
which is a good thing because you're not

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
gonna fare too well in it um if you're

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:23.780 
gonna fare too well in it um if you're
using<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.490> fore<00:04:22.789> grip<00:04:23.000> and<00:04:23.210> designs

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
and no site ah now what this does it

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.660 
and no site ah now what this does it
doesn't<00:04:29.340> give<00:04:29.820> you<00:04:29.850> enough<00:04:30.150> arm<00:04:31.400> zoom<00:04:32.400> to

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670
