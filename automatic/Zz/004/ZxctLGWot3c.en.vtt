00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:17.230
 an impression of great satisfaction 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:21.640
 to have succeeded so despite all the 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.610
 difficulties in reuniting the family we 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.980
 have produced texts that I think 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.699
 its the consiel most widely 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.220
 possible 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.710
 they were shared by all the 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.390
 basketball family are clubs that 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.730
 are the actors and the novelty is 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.280
 that on all clubs the regions are 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.999
 involved had seen them they were 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.280
 present massively it's also the 

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:47.319
 coaches' contribution the 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.449
 contribution of the arbitrators 

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:51.100
 construction of officials 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.100
 building all those who are 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.710
 today so amateurs or 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.179
 basketball players but also it's the 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.179
 contribution of resource persons 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:03.010
 quality available to our country is 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:06.760
 the shadow of texts that reflect 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.580
 the ambition is senegal this 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.200
 given to the development of basketball 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.690
 ambitions of the rest justified by the 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.090
 tremendous potential that we have these 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.430
 texts are also accepted texts 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.520
 understood adopted by the federation 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.590
 international basketball and so I 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.960
 think senegal or Thursday has crossed 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:31.810
 a big step because today we 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.540
 have decided freely with all 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.850
 basketball players that it's the club that 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.750
 are going to vote and clubs need to be able 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:43.240
 mandated leaders and we have 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.460
 decided together that we can not anymore and that 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.470
 so it's part of fair play and 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.300
 ethics in a week 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.520
 to be presidents of both clubs this is 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.880
 not acceptable it's not acceptable 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.280
 we decided that to be mandated 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.800
 by the club each club you know 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.960
 for basketball comes to affiliate in 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.340
 beginning of the season and therefore presents a 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.220
 affiliate card in which 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.420
 include leaders and illegitimate 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.159
 we issue licenses 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.050
 of intelligent to these people when we 

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:13.480
 organize things we can not 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.579
 to accept someone who does not have his 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.460
 licenses there to be in the water of 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.920
 release 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.730
 I am a consensus man Thursday 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.130
 on behalf of the couple 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.930
 I am a man who tries to 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.690
 understand all the problems each 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.700
 times as he engaged baroque arias 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.270
 mathieu faye who will be the candidates 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.100
 never have I spoken to them so much 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.640
 that is reflected in particular by 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.470
 sms 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.390
 yes I even know that one analyzes the 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.100
 communications I know how to slim down 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.350
 not the time but because what I say 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.910
 that's what I say to those people there and 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.480
 that these relationships we are in the 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.930
 righteousness 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:52.060
 we are in the legitimacy and we 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.060
 are in the responsibility 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.250
 it is the validation commission of 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.220
 nominations that will decide young people in 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.530

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.390
 glaze you are 35 years old 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.760

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.800

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.840

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.360
 this commission but the textures enough 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.820
