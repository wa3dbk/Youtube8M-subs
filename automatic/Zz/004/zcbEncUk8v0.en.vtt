00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.059
 hello everyone welcome again to 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.830
 our channel look for Latin America today 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.280
 let's talk about a very 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.890
 important of our team either for 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.110
 be on a camping trip in the jungle or to 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.200
 a survival situation is 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.570
 the afternoon 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.840
 this is one of the top ten 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.100
 Items you should have in a backpack 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.960
 it's a piece that really 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.750
 we can build infinity of 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.850
 configurations for shelters stores and 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.770
 protection from rain and 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.430
 elements stay with me for a 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.430
 detailed review 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.420
 Y 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.680
 or not 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.180
 here we have the afternoon comes in this 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.790
 small lining that brings the description 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.880
 of the tarp as well as the brand's 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.670
 manufacturer that is the company of the kingdom 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.280
 united and of ham specialist in the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:28.260
 hammocks and tarpaulins manufacturing 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:32.130
 type for the jungle really is quite 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.020
 robust and strong compared to other 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.230
 that I have had the opportunity to try 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.940
 so this vigo company 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:42.630
 they really have a quality standard 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:46.200
 quite demanding here we see the logo of 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.690
 we would say as well as the model of afternoon that 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.300
 is to edit three by three meters 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.680
 Here you can see a small diagram of the 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.860
 tarp 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.490
 and how the points of distribution are distributed 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.729
 succession or the anchors 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.680
 all over the surface of the tam what 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.399
 allows as I told them a great 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.009
 versatility to build shelters inside 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.470
 of the main features like 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.680
 we see here in the description tells us that 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:20.099
 has 19 anchor points in total that 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.180
 comes with 4 stakes and 4 ropes for the 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:26.550
 armed the total weight of the set is 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.819
 790 grams the material is a polyester 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.690
 neither waterproof and the color of this in 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.670
 particular is the coyote or brown color 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.940
 as for the dimensions of agreement 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.160
 The model is 3 x 3 meters 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.910
 Now let's take it out of the lining to see 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.910
 the turn 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.530
 here we have it comes folded from a 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.530
 pretty compact way 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.220
 and inside this one 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.250
 there is another small bag the current 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.070
 contains the four metal stakes 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.830
 as well as the four strings of three 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.110
 meters approximately in each one for 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.750
 facilitate the assembly of the thar as 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.420
 we will see below this as we see 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.060
 in this accelerated video it is mounted on a 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.940
 quite simple and fast way that 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.520
 put together a tent since only 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.550
 we have to fix it press it four 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:29.600
 different points here go inside 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:32.660
 of the tarp already armed as you see covers a 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.960
 pretty wide surface either for 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.930
 the placement of a hammock or for 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:42.140
 directly place our zhang or of 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.990
 sleep on the floor and be protected from 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.570
 the rain as you see in the image all 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.400
 the anchor points of the tarp have a 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.790
 plastic reinforcement with a seam 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.430
 quite resistant this in order to 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.370
 do not tear the fabric or the 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.990
 sewing when we do tension for 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.050
 give it the desired shape 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.990
 very important step so that it does not 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.090
 accumulate water on the top other 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.760
 configuration that we can do with the 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.970
 string and stakes kit that brings is 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.580
 this diagonal configuration very useful 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.580
 to hang a hammock inside 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.950
 However here on YouTube you are always 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:26.190
 publishing new ways to put it together 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.530
 adding more ropes and stakes even 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.840
 they give you forms like those of a store 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.390
 campaign to be protected by the 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.350
 side of the rain and adding already 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:40.280
 be some wooden or aluminum rods 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:43.830
 you can also put them all together pretty 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:46.620
 practical and spacious to spend the day 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.680
 on the beach we can really appreciate 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.440
 which is a very versatile tool for 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.890
 shelter us and have a better stay 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.230

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:01.980
 can buy directly by the 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:04.860
