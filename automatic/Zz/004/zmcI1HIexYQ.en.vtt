kill one that is not too great

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.660 
kill one that is not too great
definitely<00:02:49.920> not<00:02:50.100> I<00:02:51.950> just<00:02:52.950> can't<00:02:53.070> really<00:02:53.370> seem

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
definitely not I just can't really seem

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.890 
definitely not I just can't really seem
to<00:02:53.790> figure<00:02:53.940> out<00:02:54.120> whether<00:02:54.270> spawning<00:02:54.660> it<00:02:54.870> i

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
to figure out whether spawning it i

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.920 
to figure out whether spawning it i
think<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.320> spawns<00:02:55.620> may<00:02:55.800> have<00:02:55.920> flipped<00:02:56.930> is

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
think the spawns may have flipped is

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.180 
think the spawns may have flipped is
that<00:02:58.110> possible<00:02:58.320> I<00:02:58.850> think<00:02:59.850> so<00:03:00.000> yeah<00:03:01.190> pretty

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
that possible I think so yeah pretty

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.230 
that possible I think so yeah pretty
sure<00:03:02.280> about<00:03:02.520> that<00:03:03.290> yeah<00:03:04.290> they<00:03:04.590> have<00:03:04.770> okay

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
sure about that yeah they have okay

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.810 
sure about that yeah they have okay
where's<00:03:06.240> this<00:03:06.300> person<00:03:06.660> act<00:03:07.610> someone<00:03:08.610> just
