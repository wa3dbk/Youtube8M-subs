addition<00:00:51.780> these<00:00:52.469> two<00:00:52.800> technologies<00:00:53.219> work

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
addition these two technologies work

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.510 
addition these two technologies work
together<00:00:54.230> with<00:00:55.230> another<00:00:55.530> technology<00:00:56.250> called

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
together with another technology called

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.080 
together with another technology called

woofer woofer holds the ball on the
string<00:01:00.739> 25%<00:01:01.739> longer<00:01:02.340> allowing<00:01:02.910> for<00:01:03.300> more

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
string 25% longer allowing for more

string 25% longer allowing for more
topspin<00:01:04.080> more<00:01:04.650> control<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.400> more<00:01:05.489> power<00:01:06.650> all

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
topspin more control and more power all

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.679 
topspin more control and more power all
these<00:01:07.860> three<00:01:08.159> technologies<00:01:08.549> are<00:01:09.150> additive

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
these three technologies are additive

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.260 
these three technologies are additive
which<00:01:09.990> means<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:11.280> get<00:01:11.610> up<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.970> about<00:01:12.210> a

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
which means that you get up to about a

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.109 
which means that you get up to about a
fifty<00:01:12.689> percent<00:01:13.280> more<00:01:14.280> powerful<00:01:14.909> more

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
controllable hit and finally we have

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.249 
controllable hit and finally we have
what's<00:01:18.390> called<00:01:18.710> cortex<00:01:19.710> technology<00:01:20.400> which

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
what's called cortex technology which

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.690 
what's called cortex technology which
