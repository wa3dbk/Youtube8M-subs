00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 in this context 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.299
 until now, paulo 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.310
 I do not think we're crazy about you. 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.239
 that's what happened 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:21.640
 it lasted little 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.640
 never missed 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:31.300
 case 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.790
 at the high 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.310
 the couple ended up 4 to 4 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.230
 If I stay with what happened 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.750
 which did not occur 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.750
 after a year 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.240
 living in the cabula neighborhood 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.240
 at the high 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.470
 pear tree 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.310
 the demand for the product 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.690
 The place eventually died. 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:11.520
 and I stay 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.520
 your power 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.780
 the cupola toucan 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.200
 comment 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.170
 I was very happy 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.730
 I never enter the swimming pool soccer field. 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.590
 if I stay 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.590
 in the power 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.710
 so finish 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.710
 Paulo 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.310
 so the technician 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.130
 in the case of the victim himself 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.130
 I want to explain what happened 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.189
 repeating the maracanÃ£ score 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.189
 we will not run away 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:22.199
 I think the Portuguese people 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:25.199
 I want to explain what happened 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:33.039
 Yet 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:35.049
 back on the scoreboard the sea 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.229
 the world 

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:40.479
 bolicanho 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:41.699
