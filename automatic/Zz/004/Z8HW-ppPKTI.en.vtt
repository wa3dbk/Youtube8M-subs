huge<00:02:54.720> difference<00:02:55.110> between<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.560> two<00:02:55.740> is<00:02:55.770> that

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
huge difference between the two is that

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.090 
huge difference between the two is that
it's<00:02:56.340> not<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.490> direct<00:02:56.910> sound<00:02:57.740> hence<00:02:58.740> on<00:02:58.980> the

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
it's not a direct sound hence on the

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.770 
it's not a direct sound hence on the
electric<00:02:59.640> I<00:02:59.820> have<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.150> opportunity<00:03:00.270> to

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
electric I have the opportunity to

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.810 
electric I have the opportunity to
change<00:03:01.170> my<00:03:01.470> signal<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.220> do<00:03:02.310> all<00:03:02.459> sorts<00:03:02.490> of

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
change my signal and do all sorts of

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.720 
change my signal and do all sorts of
interesting<00:03:03.090> things<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:04.650> for<00:03:05.130> example<00:03:05.160> if<00:03:05.640> I

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
interesting things so for example if I

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.160 
interesting things so for example if I
were<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.910> just<00:03:06.030> play<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.360> guitar<00:03:06.660> that<00:03:06.870> doing

were to just play the guitar that doing
anything<00:03:07.350> to<00:03:07.620> it<00:03:08.750> just<00:03:09.750> sound<00:03:09.959> like<00:03:10.050> that<00:03:10.320> I

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
anything to it just sound like that I

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.090 
anything to it just sound like that I
work<00:03:11.160> I<00:03:11.430> can<00:03:11.820> click<00:03:12.570> a<00:03:12.630> button<00:03:12.840> on<00:03:13.020> the<00:03:13.140> amp<00:03:13.320> to

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
work I can click a button on the amp to

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.960 
work I can click a button on the amp to
distort<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:14.760> sale

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.110 

and<00:03:19.690> now<00:03:19.990> have<00:03:20.170> a<00:03:20.230> much<00:03:20.290> meaner<00:03:20.770> sound<00:03:21.280> that's

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
and now have a much meaner sound that's

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.490 
and now have a much meaner sound that's

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.250 
between my aunt my guitar and there are
a<00:03:36.850> lot<00:03:37.300> of<00:03:37.330> different<00:03:37.690> types<00:03:37.780> of<00:03:37.900> things<00:03:38.140> you

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
a lot of different types of things you

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.870 
a lot of different types of things you
can<00:03:38.380> delay<00:03:38.710> the<00:03:38.740> sound<00:03:39.130> so<00:03:39.310> you<00:03:39.400> have<00:03:39.490> an<00:03:39.580> echo

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
can delay the sound so you have an echo

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.850 
can delay the sound so you have an echo
sound<00:03:40.210> you<00:03:40.750> can<00:03:40.930> add<00:03:41.080> all<00:03:41.290> sorts<00:03:41.470> of<00:03:41.590> strange

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
sound you can add all sorts of strange

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.710 
sound you can add all sorts of strange
things<00:03:42.190> that<00:03:42.400> give<00:03:42.640> it<00:03:42.670> water<00:03:43.000> sounds<00:03:43.570> like<00:03:43.690> a

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
things that give it water sounds like a

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.160 
things that give it water sounds like a
phaser<00:03:44.050> and<00:03:44.580> all<00:03:45.580> these<00:03:45.700> ideas<00:03:45.910> are<00:03:46.570> because

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
phaser and all these ideas are because

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.230 
phaser and all these ideas are because
since<00:03:47.530> i<00:03:47.620> have<00:03:47.770> an<00:03:47.860> electrical<00:03:48.310> signal<00:03:48.490> i<00:03:48.910> can

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
since i have an electrical signal i can

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.940 
since i have an electrical signal i can
modify<00:03:49.570> it<00:03:49.780> and<00:03:50.050> give<00:03:50.200> it<00:03:50.230> also<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:50.620> strange

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
modify it and give it also the strange

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.810 
modify it and give it also the strange
sounds<00:03:51.990> ok<00:03:52.990> now<00:03:53.800> there<00:03:54.310> are<00:03:54.430> many<00:03:54.520> other

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
sounds ok now there are many other

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.160 
sounds ok now there are many other
differences<00:03:55.270> that<00:03:55.450> a<00:03:55.510> lot<00:03:55.720> of<00:03:55.810> people<00:03:55.930> don't

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
differences that a lot of people don't

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.570 
differences that a lot of people don't
really<00:03:56.320> realize<00:03:56.470> i<00:03:56.920> means<00:03:57.070> pretty<00:03:57.220> eyes<00:03:57.370> to

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
really realize i means pretty eyes to

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.360 
really realize i means pretty eyes to
see<00:03:57.790> this<00:03:58.300> is<00:03:58.480> hollow<00:03:58.690> that's<00:03:59.290> not<00:03:59.620> people

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
see this is hollow that's not people

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.210 
see this is hollow that's not people
don't<00:04:00.550> really<00:04:00.670> realize<00:04:00.820> is<00:04:01.510> that<00:04:02.110> bodies<00:04:02.890> are

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
don't really realize is that bodies are

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.550 
don't really realize is that bodies are
more<00:04:04.000> similar<00:04:04.240> than<00:04:04.480> think<00:04:04.930> see<00:04:05.200> this<00:04:05.380> has

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
more similar than think see this has

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.990 
more similar than think see this has
like<00:04:05.680> that<00:04:05.830> nice<00:04:06.070> big<00:04:06.280> hollow<00:04:06.580> thing<00:04:06.820> we

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
like that nice big hollow thing we

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.030 
like that nice big hollow thing we
talking<00:04:07.240> about<00:04:07.270> this<00:04:07.630> if<00:04:07.930> you<00:04:08.470> notice<00:04:08.830> it's

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
talking about this if you notice it's

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.320 
talking about this if you notice it's
not<00:04:09.190> just<00:04:09.400> a<00:04:09.490> strip<00:04:09.760> of<00:04:09.790> wood<00:04:10.030> it's<00:04:10.240> a

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
not just a strip of wood it's a

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.390 
not just a strip of wood it's a
full-size<00:04:10.780> would<00:04:11.110> and<00:04:11.410> although<00:04:12.100> is<00:04:12.220> much

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
full-size would and although is much

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.060 
full-size would and although is much
smaller<00:04:12.730> it's<00:04:13.150> quite<00:04:13.390> heavier<00:04:13.900> the<00:04:14.560> reason<00:04:14.950> is

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
smaller it's quite heavier the reason is

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.440 
smaller it's quite heavier the reason is
is<00:04:15.220> that<00:04:15.370> even<00:04:15.610> though<00:04:15.730> we're<00:04:15.880> using<00:04:16.120> the

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
is that even though we're using the

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.880 
is that even though we're using the
electrical<00:04:16.959> signal<00:04:17.350> we<00:04:17.440> still<00:04:17.680> want<00:04:17.829> the

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
electrical signal we still want the

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.220 
electrical signal we still want the
natural<00:04:18.459> sound<00:04:18.669> of<00:04:18.850> the<00:04:18.910> wood<00:04:19.120> as<00:04:19.359> if<00:04:19.989> we<00:04:20.140> were

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
natural sound of the wood as if we were

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.830 
natural sound of the wood as if we were
an<00:04:20.500> acoustic<00:04:20.950> guitar<00:04:21.150> now<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:22.210> other<00:04:22.450> main

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
an acoustic guitar now the other main

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.120 
an acoustic guitar now the other main
difference<00:04:23.290> and<00:04:23.470> this<00:04:23.530> one<00:04:23.680> has<00:04:23.800> a<00:04:23.860> huge

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
difference and this one has a huge

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.360 
difference and this one has a huge
effect<00:04:24.310> on<00:04:24.669> usage<00:04:25.180> is<00:04:25.720> the<00:04:25.930> next<00:04:26.380> I'll<00:04:27.130> show

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
effect on usage is the next I'll show

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.940 
effect on usage is the next I'll show
you<00:04:27.430> the<00:04:27.580> two<00:04:27.820> next<00:04:28.270> to<00:04:28.960> see<00:04:29.169> that<00:04:29.440> this<00:04:29.620> neck

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
you the two next to see that this neck

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.370 
you the two next to see that this neck
is<00:04:30.400> substantially<00:04:31.180> thinner<00:04:31.540> else<00:04:32.140> are

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
is substantially thinner else are

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.270 
is substantially thinner else are
smaller<00:04:32.680> than<00:04:32.950> this<00:04:33.160> one<00:04:34.290> ok<00:04:35.290> the<00:04:35.470> main<00:04:35.800> reason

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
smaller than this one ok the main reason

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.400 
smaller than this one ok the main reason
is<00:04:36.400> is<00:04:36.669> that<00:04:36.970> because<00:04:37.270> this<00:04:37.780> requires<00:04:38.260> a

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
is is that because this requires a

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.710 
is is that because this requires a
natural<00:04:39.100> ringing<00:04:39.700> sound<00:04:39.940> a<00:04:40.030> lot<00:04:40.150> more<00:04:40.210> since

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
natural ringing sound a lot more since

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.350 
natural ringing sound a lot more since
it's<00:04:40.870> only<00:04:41.050> sound<00:04:41.440> as<00:04:41.680> the<00:04:41.830> echoes<00:04:42.460> it<00:04:42.880> needs

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
it's only sound as the echoes it needs

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.000 
it's only sound as the echoes it needs
to<00:04:43.479> have<00:04:43.630> that<00:04:43.780> thicker<00:04:44.080> neck<00:04:44.380> let<00:04:44.650> the<00:04:44.770> sound

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
to have that thicker neck let the sound

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.670 
to have that thicker neck let the sound
travel<00:04:45.460> also<00:04:46.450> the<00:04:46.570> strings<00:04:46.900> are<00:04:47.050> thicker<00:04:47.380> and

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
travel also the strings are thicker and

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.590 
travel also the strings are thicker and
higher<00:04:47.919> up<00:04:48.250> again<00:04:48.669> to<00:04:48.850> get<00:04:48.940> that<00:04:49.180> natural

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
higher up again to get that natural

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.280 
higher up again to get that natural
sound<00:04:49.919> so<00:04:50.919> on<00:04:51.280> acoustic<00:04:52.210> guitar<00:04:52.750> because<00:04:53.080> it

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
sound so on acoustic guitar because it

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.260 
sound so on acoustic guitar because it
is<00:04:53.410> it's<00:04:54.100> a<00:04:54.220> lot<00:04:54.400> harder<00:04:54.580> to<00:04:54.790> do<00:04:54.970> a<00:04:55.000> lot<00:04:55.240> of

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
is it's a lot harder to do a lot of

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.370 
is it's a lot harder to do a lot of
different<00:04:55.630> moves<00:04:55.810> there

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
different moves there

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.440 
different moves there
electric<00:04:57.070> like<00:04:57.250> those<00:04:57.430> been<00:04:57.700> zones<00:04:58.030> do<00:04:58.210> no

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
electric like those been zones do no

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.080 
electric like those been zones do no
work<00:04:58.660> a<00:04:59.200> lot<00:05:00.070> harder<00:05:00.100> to<00:05:00.460> do<00:05:00.640> it<00:05:00.790> make<00:05:00.940> them

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
work a lot harder to do it make them

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.990 
work a lot harder to do it make them
sound<00:05:01.300> however<00:05:01.810> an<00:05:02.380> acoustic<00:05:03.190> Tardos<00:05:03.640> harder

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
sound however an acoustic Tardos harder

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000 
sound however an acoustic Tardos harder
to<00:05:04.060> play<00:05:04.330> fast<00:05:04.660> on<00:05:04.960> as<00:05:05.230> a<00:05:05.530> much<00:05:05.740> sweeter

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
to play fast on as a much sweeter

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.770 
to play fast on as a much sweeter
natural<00:05:06.790> sound<00:05:07.030> so<00:05:07.240> I'm<00:05:07.360> playing<00:05:07.600> chords<00:05:09.780> I'm

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
natural sound so I'm playing chords I'm

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.900 
natural sound so I'm playing chords I'm
a<00:05:10.900> very<00:05:11.110> nice<00:05:11.320> sound<00:05:11.590> going<00:05:11.860> for<00:05:12.190> me<00:05:12.310> that's

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
a very nice sound going for me that's

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.370 
a very nice sound going for me that's
why<00:05:13.090> I<00:05:13.120> couche<00:05:13.390> the<00:05:13.570> guitars<00:05:13.840> are<00:05:14.020> generally

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
why I couche the guitars are generally

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.440 
why I couche the guitars are generally
used<00:05:14.500> for<00:05:14.650> things<00:05:14.890> like<00:05:15.070> folk<00:05:15.520> or<00:05:15.850> country

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
used for things like folk or country

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.810 
used for things like folk or country
soft<00:05:17.200> rock<00:05:17.410> things<00:05:17.710> that<00:05:17.890> require<00:05:18.190> singing

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
soft rock things that require singing

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.190 
soft rock things that require singing
and<00:05:19.540> just<00:05:19.930> strumming<00:05:20.350> chords<00:05:22.050> whereas<00:05:23.050> the

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
and just strumming chords whereas the

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.860 
and just strumming chords whereas the
electric<00:05:23.650> guitar<00:05:23.950> as<00:05:24.190> I<00:05:24.640> can<00:05:24.970> assure<00:05:25.090> you<00:05:25.360> it

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
electric guitar as I can assure you it

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.130 
electric guitar as I can assure you it
is<00:05:26.470> used<00:05:26.740> for<00:05:27.010> more<00:05:27.220> the<00:05:27.460> in<00:05:27.880> my<00:05:28.360> opinion<00:05:28.750> fun

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
is used for more the in my opinion fun

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:47.969 
is used for more the in my opinion fun
stuff<00:05:29.470> the<00:05:29.800> rock<00:05:30.250> blues<00:05:31.000> metal<00:05:31.690> No<00:05:32.410> so<00:05:33.130> you

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:51.460 

so<00:05:48.979> I<00:05:49.250> think<00:05:50.150> that's<00:05:50.509> a<00:05:50.720> pretty<00:05:50.900> good<00:05:51.080> summary

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
so I think that's a pretty good summary

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.050 
so I think that's a pretty good summary
of<00:05:51.590> the<00:05:52.159> differences<00:05:52.699> and<00:05:52.970> similarities

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
of the differences and similarities

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.749 
of the differences and similarities
between<00:05:53.870> the<00:05:54.080> two<00:05:54.229> types<00:05:54.409> of<00:05:54.620> guitars<00:05:54.919> I<00:05:55.250> hope

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:55.759 
between the two types of guitars I hope

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:57.670 
between the two types of guitars I hope
that<00:05:55.939> next<00:05:56.120> time<00:05:56.240> you<00:05:56.389> guys<00:05:56.810> listen<00:05:57.379> to<00:05:57.409> some

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680
