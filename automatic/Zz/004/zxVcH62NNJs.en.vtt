would be in the White House now I know I
know<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.230> very<00:00:49.260> similar<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.770> five<00:00:50.070> hear

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940

me out

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.020 
me out
so<00:00:52.160> the<00:00:53.160> reason<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.489> would<00:00:53.610> like<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
so the reason I would like it in the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.850 
so the reason I would like it in the
White<00:00:54.180> House<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.780> first<00:00:54.989> off<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.710> would

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
White House is the first off you would

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.900 
White House is the first off you would
get<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.129> president's<00:00:56.850> coming<00:00:57.510> up<00:00:57.660> as<00:00:57.809> zombies

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
get the president's coming up as zombies

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.729 
get the president's coming up as zombies
while<00:00:59.910> they<00:01:00.120> wouldn't<00:01:00.359> be<00:01:00.420> buried<00:01:00.750> there<00:01:00.960> you

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
while they wouldn't be buried there you

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.920 
while they wouldn't be buried there you
could<00:01:01.920> just<00:01:01.949> see<00:01:02.609> Treyarch<00:01:03.149> doing<00:01:03.539> something

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
could just see Treyarch doing something

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:04.640 
could just see Treyarch doing something
like<00:01:03.960> that

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
like that

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.370 
like that
like<00:01:04.920> how<00:01:05.070> freaking<00:01:05.880> awesome<00:01:06.060> would<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.869> be<00:01:07.020> if

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
like how freaking awesome would it be if

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.399 
like how freaking awesome would it be if
you<00:01:07.470> had<00:01:08.689> clearly<00:01:09.689> all<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.930> presidents

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
you had clearly all the presidents

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.020 
you had clearly all the presidents
aren't<00:01:10.619> buried<00:01:10.979> at<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.130> White<00:01:11.280> House<00:01:11.460> but

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
aren't buried at the White House but

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.030 
aren't buried at the White House but
knowing<00:01:12.689> Treyarch<00:01:13.140> they<00:01:13.290> would<00:01:13.439> do<00:01:13.590> something

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
knowing Treyarch they would do something

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.170 
knowing Treyarch they would do something
like<00:01:14.070> an<00:01:14.310> easter<00:01:14.549> egg<00:01:14.610> or<00:01:14.729> something<00:01:15.030> where

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
like an easter egg or something where

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.550 
like an easter egg or something where
you<00:01:15.210> would<00:01:15.330> have<00:01:15.509> like<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.810> presidents<00:01:16.350> there

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
you would have like the presidents there

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.280 
you would have like the presidents there
so<00:01:17.220> maybe<00:01:17.580> not<00:01:17.880> or<00:01:18.119> maybe<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.780> president

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
so maybe not or maybe the president

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.590 
so maybe not or maybe the president
whoever<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.650> was<00:01:19.740> but<00:01:20.250> anyways<00:01:20.490> let's<00:01:21.420> say

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
whoever it was but anyways let's say

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.690 
whoever it was but anyways let's say
hypothetically<00:01:22.170> Treyarch<00:01:22.950> has<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:23.520> all

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
hypothetically Treyarch has it so all

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.039 
hypothetically Treyarch has it so all
the<00:01:23.729> presidents<00:01:24.240> were<00:01:24.270> buried<00:01:24.630> there<00:01:24.659> or

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
the presidents were buried there or

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.600 
the presidents were buried there or
somehow<00:01:25.409> there<00:01:25.710> at<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.920> same<00:01:26.040> time<00:01:26.100> even

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
somehow there at the same time even

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.969 
somehow there at the same time even
though<00:01:26.729> they<00:01:26.880> were<00:01:26.939> all<00:01:27.030> dead<00:01:27.390> um<00:01:27.799> what<00:01:28.799> if<00:01:28.890> you

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
though they were all dead um what if you

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.370 
though they were all dead um what if you
had<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.250> zombie<00:01:29.610> George<00:01:29.820> Washington<00:01:30.420> what

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
had like a zombie George Washington what

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.289 
had like a zombie George Washington what
if<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.590> had<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> zombie<00:01:32.130> fucking<00:01:32.790> Abraham

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
if you had a zombie fucking Abraham

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.969 
if you had a zombie fucking Abraham
Lincoln<00:01:33.720> come<00:01:34.020> down<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.380> try<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.560> beat<00:01:34.770> you

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
Lincoln come down and try to beat you

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.190 
Lincoln come down and try to beat you
essentially<00:01:35.640> what<00:01:35.820> I'm<00:01:35.909> thinking<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.420> every

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
essentially what I'm thinking is every

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.380 
essentially what I'm thinking is every
five<00:01:37.500> rounds<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.100> would<00:01:38.220> have<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:39.090> would<00:01:39.210> get

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
five rounds you would have you would get

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.390 
five rounds you would have you would get
a<00:01:39.420> new<00:01:39.750> president<00:01:40.079> as<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> boss<00:01:40.860> instead<00:01:41.310> of

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
a new president as a boss instead of

you go to four parks it's essentially

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.250 
you go to four parks it's essentially
kind<00:03:59.970> of<00:04:00.060> like<00:04:00.180> transit<00:04:00.630> you<00:04:00.720> have<00:04:00.870> your<00:04:01.019> four

kind of like transit you have your four
parts<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.829> your<00:04:02.340> map<00:04:02.549> you<00:04:02.669> have<00:04:02.700> F<00:04:02.910> cot<00:04:03.150> animal

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
parts to your map you have F cot animal

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.500 
parts to your map you have F cot animal
magic<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.470> Hollywood<00:04:05.400> studios<00:04:05.700> and<00:04:05.910> you<00:04:06.359> can

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
magic and Hollywood studios and you can

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.059 
magic and Hollywood studios and you can
go<00:04:06.630> to<00:04:06.660> all<00:04:06.870> of<00:04:06.959> them<00:04:07.169> and<00:04:07.380> each<00:04:07.709> one<00:04:07.919> of<00:04:07.950> them

go to all of them and each one of them

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.690 
go to all of them and each one of them
clearly<00:04:08.819> presents<00:04:09.329> a<00:04:09.450> different<00:04:10.700> difficulty

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
clearly presents a different difficulty

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.250 
clearly presents a different difficulty
I<00:04:11.730> guess<00:04:12.090> as<00:04:12.540> you<00:04:12.750> could<00:04:12.900> say<00:04:13.079> like<00:04:13.230> a

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
I guess as you could say like a

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.750 
I guess as you could say like a
different<00:04:13.620> it<00:04:13.769> brings<00:04:14.040> a<00:04:14.160> whole<00:04:14.190> different

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
different it brings a whole different

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.089 
different it brings a whole different
atmosphere<00:04:14.910> and<00:04:15.569> they<00:04:16.169> could<00:04:16.320> really<00:04:16.590> really

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
atmosphere and they could really really

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:19.219 
atmosphere and they could really really
do<00:04:17.250> a<00:04:17.280> lot<00:04:17.400> in<00:04:17.729> freaking<00:04:18.479> Animal<00:04:18.810> Kingdom<00:04:19.109> you
