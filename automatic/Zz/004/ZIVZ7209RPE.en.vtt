00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.980 
today I finally got one diamond camos
finally<00:00:11.639> finally<00:00:12.030> after<00:00:12.210> all<00:00:12.450> this<00:00:12.599> time<00:00:12.809> I've

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
finally finally after all this time I've

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.360 
finally finally after all this time I've
got<00:00:13.139> my<00:00:13.230> diamond<00:00:13.500> camo<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:13.860> fully<00:00:14.070> assault

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.150 
got my diamond camo is fully assault
rifles<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.839> feels<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.470> much<00:00:16.650> better<00:00:16.920> to

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
rifles and it feels so much better to

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.740 
rifles and it feels so much better to
actually<00:00:17.430> add<00:00:17.580> them<00:00:17.760> unlocked<00:00:18.210> because<00:00:18.570> I

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
actually add them unlocked because I

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.269 
actually add them unlocked because I
don't<00:00:19.080> know<00:00:19.170> why<00:00:19.380> but<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.710> always<00:00:19.949> pick<00:00:20.160> the

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
don't know why but I always pick the

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.310 
don't know why but I always pick the
hardest<00:00:20.609> challenges<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.180> do<00:00:21.330> in<00:00:21.720> black<00:00:22.109> ops

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
hardest challenges to do in black ops

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.859 
hardest challenges to do in black ops
because<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.890> don't<00:00:23.369> actually<00:00:23.660> like<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.689> know

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869

when<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.420> did<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.960> decided<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.590> wanted<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:50.010> add<00:00:50.520> try

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
when I did I decided I wanted to add try

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.729 
when I did I decided I wanted to add try
and<00:00:51.360> do<00:00:51.420> some<00:00:51.570> challenges<00:00:52.020> because<00:00:52.140> some

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
and do some challenges because some

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.650 
and do some challenges because some
reason<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.190> mean<00:00:53.370> it's<00:00:53.940> not<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.300> game<00:00:54.480> is

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
reason I mean it's not that the game is

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.209 
reason I mean it's not that the game is
terrible<00:00:55.110> I've<00:00:55.320> just<00:00:55.469> gotten<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> bit<00:00:55.829> bored<00:00:56.100> of

terrible I've just gotten a bit bored of

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.040 
terrible I've just gotten a bit bored of
it<00:00:56.309> because<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.850> guess<00:00:57.030> I'd<00:00:57.210> like<00:00:57.300> as<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.570> YouTube

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050

videos and you play the game so much to

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.570 
videos and you play the game so much to
try<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.020> get<00:01:07.200> gameplay<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.890> find<00:01:08.430> out

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
try and get gameplay and find out

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.219 
try and get gameplay and find out
information<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.600> games<00:01:09.780> gets<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.110> bit

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
information so the games gets a bit

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.890 
information so the games gets a bit
stale<00:01:10.470> pretty<00:01:10.830> quickly<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.729> I'm<00:01:12.450> just<00:01:12.659> kind<00:01:12.840> of

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
stale pretty quickly so I'm just kind of

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.179 
stale pretty quickly so I'm just kind of
waiting<00:01:13.350> for<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.530> map<00:01:13.680> packs<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.040> guess

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
waiting for the map packs I guess

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.010 
waiting for the map packs I guess
because<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.880> will<00:01:14.970> kind<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.270> refresh<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
because that will kind of refresh the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.450 
because that will kind of refresh the
game<00:01:16.170> for<00:01:16.380> me<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.650> make<00:01:17.250> them<00:01:17.400> more

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
game for me and make them more

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.310 
game for me and make them more
interesting<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.880> play<00:01:18.030> but<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.600> definitely

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
interesting to play but I definitely

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.620 
interesting to play but I definitely
kind<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.799> gotten<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.159> bit<00:01:20.340> bored<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.000> I

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
kind of gotten a bit bored of it and I

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.690 
kind of gotten a bit bored of it and I
decided<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.350> do<00:01:22.560> something<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.920> try<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.189> make

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
decided to do something to try and make

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.219 
decided to do something to try and make
it<00:01:23.820> more<00:01:23.909> interesting<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.420> for<00:01:24.810> me<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:24.990> was

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
it more interesting and for me that was

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.960

in<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.340> category<00:03:08.760> because<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.209> have<00:03:09.330> to

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
in the category because you have to

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.240 
in the category because you have to
spray<00:03:09.780> Google<00:03:09.989> down<00:03:10.110> bullets<00:03:10.350> I<00:03:10.650> don't<00:03:11.040> like

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
spray Google down bullets I don't like

spray Google down bullets I don't like
that<00:03:11.370> sniping<00:03:11.819> and<00:03:12.030> but<00:03:12.930> yeah<00:03:13.050> I<00:03:13.080> grinded

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
that sniping and but yeah I grinded

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.610 
that sniping and but yeah I grinded
through<00:03:13.560> got<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.739> snipers<00:03:14.130> diamond<00:03:14.730> and

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
through got the snipers diamond and

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.020 
through got the snipers diamond and
guess<00:03:16.620> like<00:03:17.040> now<00:03:17.310> if<00:03:17.489> I<00:03:17.579> were<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.760> do<00:03:17.820> a<00:03:17.850> quick

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
guess like now if I were to do a quick

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.310 
guess like now if I were to do a quick
scope<00:03:18.209> match<00:03:18.390> I<00:03:18.540> haven't<00:03:18.810> diamond<00:03:19.110> which<00:03:19.200> is

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
scope match I haven't diamond which is

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.620 
scope match I haven't diamond which is
cool<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:20.610> then<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:20.760> decide<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.060> sort<00:03:21.540> right

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
cool and and then I decide to sort right

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.780 
cool and and then I decide to sort right
I<00:03:21.750> don't<00:03:21.900> know<00:03:21.959> why<00:03:22.110> because<00:03:22.320> again<00:03:22.980> I<00:03:23.190> always

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
I don't know why because again I always

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.340 
I don't know why because again I always
seem<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.060> choose<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.480> hardest<00:03:24.810> challenges<00:03:25.200> to

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
seem to choose the hardest challenges to

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.660 
seem to choose the hardest challenges to
do<00:03:25.500> because<00:03:25.739> they<00:03:25.860> sawed<00:03:26.040> rifles<00:03:26.340> it's<00:03:26.430> nine

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
do because they sawed rifles it's nine

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.280 
do because they sawed rifles it's nine
of<00:03:26.880> them<00:03:27.030> so<00:03:27.150> that's<00:03:27.209> nine<00:03:27.630> guns<00:03:27.930> you<00:03:28.079> have<00:03:28.170> to

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
of them so that's nine guns you have to

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.479 
of them so that's nine guns you have to
get<00:03:28.380> gold<00:03:28.620> instead<00:03:28.890> of<00:03:29.100> doing<00:03:29.370> another

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
get gold instead of doing another

lose<00:04:22.760> and<00:04:23.060> that's<00:04:23.210> the<00:04:23.300> interesting<00:04:23.480> thing<00:04:23.810> I

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
lose and that's the interesting thing I

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.270 
lose and that's the interesting thing I
kind<00:04:24.170> of<00:04:24.200> like<00:04:24.350> it<00:04:24.500> I<00:04:24.560> dislike<00:04:24.950> it<00:04:25.190> because

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
kind of like it I dislike it because

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.060 
kind of like it I dislike it because
that<00:04:26.090> means<00:04:26.330> if<00:04:26.930> you<00:04:27.230> get<00:04:27.530> a<00:04:27.560> certain<00:04:27.740> camo

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
that means if you get a certain camo

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.700 
that means if you get a certain camo
then<00:04:28.580> throughout<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.090> entire<00:04:29.570> period<00:04:30.470> of

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
then throughout the entire period of

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.440 
then throughout the entire period of
black<00:04:31.100> ops<00:04:31.250> 2<00:04:31.460> you<00:04:31.639> will<00:04:31.700> never<00:04:31.880> ever<00:04:32.150> lose<00:04:32.389> it

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
black ops 2 you will never ever lose it

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.330 
black ops 2 you will never ever lose it
even<00:04:32.780> if<00:04:32.930> you<00:04:33.020> prestige<00:04:33.380> the<00:04:33.530> gun<00:04:33.710> or<00:04:34.220> you

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
even if you prestige the gun or you

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.340 
even if you prestige the gun or you
proceed<00:04:34.730> your<00:04:34.880> character<00:04:35.419> you<00:04:36.050> will<00:04:36.200> never

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
proceed your character you will never

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.750 
proceed your character you will never
ever<00:04:36.560> lose<00:04:36.740> it<00:04:36.770> there's<00:04:37.070> no<00:04:37.160> way<00:04:37.340> you<00:04:37.400> can<00:04:37.730> lose

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
ever lose it there's no way you can lose

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.430 
ever lose it there's no way you can lose
it<00:04:38.090> unless<00:04:38.180> you<00:04:38.389> out<00:04:38.540> reset<00:04:38.870> your<00:04:39.020> stats<00:04:39.260> or

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
it unless you out reset your stats or

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.960 
it unless you out reset your stats or
delete<00:04:39.650> your<00:04:39.800> profile<00:04:40.400> character<00:04:40.820> whether

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
delete your profile character whether

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.240 
delete your profile character whether
but<00:04:41.600> there's<00:04:42.080> no<00:04:42.230> way<00:04:42.410> this<00:04:42.889> is<00:04:42.950> permanent

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
but there's no way this is permanent

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.400 
but there's no way this is permanent
which<00:04:43.550> is<00:04:43.669> pretty<00:04:43.970> cool<00:04:44.150> because<00:04:44.630> it<00:04:45.080> means

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
which is pretty cool because it means

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.890 
which is pretty cool because it means
that<00:04:45.650> like<00:04:45.830> you<00:04:46.460> always<00:04:46.790> have<00:04:46.970> it<00:04:47.120> for<00:04:47.389> the<00:04:47.780> end

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
that like you always have it for the end

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.200 
that like you always have it for the end
of<00:04:48.200> the<00:04:48.500> year<00:04:48.740> and<00:04:48.919> you<00:04:49.280> always<00:04:49.610> have<00:04:49.880> I<00:04:50.060> would

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
of the year and you always have I would

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.870 
of the year and you always have I would
always<00:04:50.330> have<00:04:50.570> my<00:04:50.780> diamond<00:04:51.380> launchers<00:04:52.070> snipers

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
always have my diamond launchers snipers

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.570 
always have my diamond launchers snipers
and<00:04:53.060> assault<00:04:53.419> rifles<00:04:53.810> and<00:04:53.960> if<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:54.890> SMG<00:04:55.310> if<00:04:55.490> I

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
and assault rifles and if the SMG if I

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.340 
and assault rifles and if the SMG if I
decided<00:04:55.880> to<00:04:55.970> go<00:04:56.060> through<00:04:56.090> them<00:04:56.450> as<00:04:56.660> well<00:04:56.840> but

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
decided to go through them as well but

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.110 
decided to go through them as well but
and<00:04:57.590> the<00:04:58.010> I<00:04:58.250> guess<00:04:58.520> the<00:04:58.640> downside<00:04:58.730> is<00:04:59.090> that

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
and the I guess the downside is that

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.610 
and the I guess the downside is that
everyone<00:04:59.540> has<00:04:59.720> them<00:05:00.050> like<00:05:00.260> they're<00:05:00.440> coming

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
everyone has them like they're coming

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.960 
everyone has them like they're coming
very<00:05:01.010> very<00:05:01.160> common<00:05:01.430> thing<00:05:01.460> which<00:05:01.820> isn't

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
very very common thing which isn't

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.640 
very very common thing which isn't
really<00:05:02.180> that<00:05:02.210> cool<00:05:02.510> but<00:05:03.020> you<00:05:03.110> go<00:05:03.200> and<00:05:03.320> so<00:05:03.440> on<00:05:03.560> my

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
really that cool but you go and so on my

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.530 
really that cool but you go and so on my
game<00:05:03.860> you<00:05:03.890> see<00:05:04.220> everyone<00:05:04.820> has<00:05:05.090> them<00:05:05.360> and

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
game you see everyone has them and

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.300 
game you see everyone has them and
they're<00:05:05.720> like<00:05:05.990> things<00:05:06.620> aren't<00:05:06.800> as<00:05:06.919> special

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
they're like things aren't as special

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.860 
they're like things aren't as special
when<00:05:07.430> everyone<00:05:07.790> has<00:05:08.030> them<00:05:08.240> like<00:05:08.360> if<00:05:08.480> everyone

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
when everyone has them like if everyone

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.780 
when everyone has them like if everyone
