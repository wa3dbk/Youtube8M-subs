 in addition to hand-to-hand fighting actions 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.930
 our electric power is limited and we can recharge ourselves by absolving the 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.280
 electricity of objects like cars 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.620
 electric posts cabins and other 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.620
 taking advantage of the confusion that reigns

 three gangs try to take control of the city

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.900
 throughout the thirty-five main missions 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.380
 what marks 20 and moss differences compared to other games of this type 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.090
 are our moral decisions can I turn robberies listed expo an infant 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.680
 our karma will evolve according to our behavior 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.320
 if cole ground would be blue and passersby will cheer us and they were 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.029
 photos for example 

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:12.319
 if we are bad 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.089
 we all booed itinerary 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:19.809
 our weight will be much more aggressive and the energy that comes out of it will be 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:25.339
 in the upper left we have a carba indicator that will decant 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:26.849
 outside 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.269
 according to our acts 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.949
 In addition to certain moments where we are raised to take one or another decision 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:35.099
 humala 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.079
 our karma will decant disfigures heroes and we save civilians 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.829
 if once dying our enemies those arrested with electric arc 

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:46.659
 and doing the secondary missions the flying karma 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:52.139
 we will be infamous if we eliminate civilians without contemplation 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:56.529
 if we absorb all the energy of the fallen are official enemies and 

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:59.529
 I understand the side missions from the side 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:03.709
 as we get experience points in karma levels 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:04.889
 we can 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:06.729
 new power 

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:10.329
 this proposal offers us a fairly large game space 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.219
 which will unlock 12 as we go 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:16.700
 the feeling of freedom is very achieved with open spaces 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.079
 and many elements with which to interact 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.299
 all three neighborhoods vary slightly in design 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.239
 pinedo his own enemies 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.230
 the powerful in quoted kinglake allows great play fluency throughout 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.089
 moment 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.980
 summarizing 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.329
 of good animations of the characters 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.719
 and visual effects for example 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:38.030
 and all this being able to travel the city 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.369
 no careers 

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:42.369
 pity wake up downs 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:46.869
 visually very good a varied in terms of missions although some 

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:49.119
 they are a bit repetitive 

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:52.429
 illana of possibilities thanks amazing replay 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:57.689
 we infer includes also confrontations 

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:00.669
