00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
guess let it do it and then during a

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.320 
guess let it do it and then during a
surgery<00:00:55.930> this<00:00:56.290> drops<00:00:56.710> like<00:00:57.670> this<00:00:57.970> is<00:00:58.150> very

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330 
surgery this drops like this is very

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.970 
surgery this drops like this is very
hard<00:00:58.510> to<00:00:58.629> see<00:00:58.839> if<00:00:59.050> I<00:00:59.170> pull<00:00:59.500> them<00:00:59.589> on<00:00:59.680> my<00:00:59.800> way

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
hard to see if I pull them on my way

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.259 
hard to see if I pull them on my way
then<00:01:00.940> it<00:01:01.180> touches<00:01:01.570> my<00:01:01.720> forehead<00:01:02.199> it's<00:01:02.559> awful

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
so here's another type maybe a little

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.550 
so here's another type maybe a little
cleanup<00:01:12.580> and<00:01:12.820> still<00:01:13.090> got<00:01:13.240> foam<00:01:13.570> it<00:01:13.900> is<00:01:14.260> very

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
cleanup and still got foam it is very

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.190 
cleanup and still got foam it is very
hard<00:01:14.860> to<00:01:14.950> sterilize<00:01:15.520> these<00:01:15.760> so<00:01:16.060> I<00:01:16.270> start<00:01:17.050> like

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
hard to sterilize these so I start like

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.030 
hard to sterilize these so I start like
