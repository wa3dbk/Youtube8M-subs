00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
through him so that's one thing I found

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.969 
through him so that's one thing I found
really<00:01:30.210> strong<00:01:30.869> one<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.140> his<00:01:31.259> great<00:01:31.560> points

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
really strong one of his great points

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.819 
really strong one of his great points
about<00:01:32.340> him<00:01:32.579> in<00:01:33.060> terms<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:34.079> sliding<00:01:34.380> tackles

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
about him in terms of sliding tackles

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
and standing tackles his standing

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.450 
and standing tackles his standing
tackles<00:01:37.110> by<00:01:37.229> far<00:01:37.590> was<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.950> more<00:01:38.130> superior

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
tackles by far was the more superior

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.740 
tackles by far was the more superior
version<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.150> can<00:01:39.270> even<00:01:39.329> see<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.600> by<00:01:39.689> the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
version and you can even see that by the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.319 
version and you can even see that by the
stats<00:01:40.049> they're<00:01:40.259> being<00:01:40.439> 98<00:01:41.090> he<00:01:42.090> literally

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
stats they're being 98 he literally

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.460 
stats they're being 98 he literally
whenever<00:01:42.659> he<00:01:42.720> tackled<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.110> opponent<00:01:43.409> you

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
whenever he tackled the opponent you

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.440 
whenever he tackled the opponent you
gonna<00:01:43.590> see<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.890> clips<00:01:44.130> as<00:01:44.280> well<00:01:44.460> pretty

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
gonna see in the clips as well pretty

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.609 
gonna see in the clips as well pretty
much<00:01:45.540> prevented<00:01:45.930> them<00:01:46.049> from<00:01:46.079> getting<00:01:46.320> through

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
much prevented them from getting through

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.080 
much prevented them from getting through
and<00:01:46.829> whenever<00:01:47.009> he<00:01:47.130> did<00:01:47.490> tackle<00:01:47.850> them<00:01:47.939> you'll

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
and whenever he did tackle them you'll

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.060 
and whenever he did tackle them you'll
see<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.899> ball<00:01:49.110> doesn't<00:01:49.290> go<00:01:49.590> too<00:01:49.649> far

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
see that the ball doesn't go too far

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.590 
see that the ball doesn't go too far
from<00:01:50.280> him<00:01:50.490> it's<00:01:50.610> always<00:01:50.909> within<00:01:51.240> his<00:01:51.390> range

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
from him it's always within his range

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.389 
from him it's always within his range
and<00:01:51.840> he<00:01:52.500> can<00:01:52.619> literally<00:01:52.920> pass<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.310> a

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
and he can literally pass it to a

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.980 
and he can literally pass it to a
midfielder<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.090> start<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.479> build<00:01:54.630> up<00:01:54.840> of

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
midfielder and start the build up of

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.590 
midfielder and start the build up of
play<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:56.130> over<00:01:56.909> there<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.119> can<00:01:57.240> see<00:01:57.270> also

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
play so over there you can see also

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.130 
play so over there you can see also
sliding<00:01:57.990> tackles<00:01:58.350> 83<00:01:59.420> probably<00:02:00.420> say<00:02:00.600> probably

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
sliding tackles 83 probably say probably

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.810 
sliding tackles 83 probably say probably
wasn't<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.409> greatest<00:02:01.710> but<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.189> also<00:02:02.369> very

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
wasn't the greatest but is also very

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.760 
wasn't the greatest but is also very
decent<00:02:03.450> in<00:02:03.509> its<00:02:03.630> own<00:02:03.750> respect<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:04.500> he<00:02:04.590> did

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
decent in its own respect so he did

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.800 
decent in its own respect so he did
slide<00:02:05.009> tackle<00:02:05.340> then<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.820> did<00:02:06.240> save<00:02:06.450> us<00:02:06.570> on<00:02:06.689> many

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
slide tackle then it did save us on many

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.240 
slide tackle then it did save us on many
occasions<00:02:07.439> from<00:02:07.530> getting<00:02:07.829> into<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.009> bit<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.220> a

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.870 
442 and I've got Darren Bent and I
believe<00:03:35.550> it<00:03:35.940> was<00:03:36.270> a<00:03:36.920> well<00:03:37.920> back<00:03:38.130> up<00:03:38.280> front<00:03:38.610> so

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
believe it was a well back up front so

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.100 
believe it was a well back up front so
not<00:03:39.300> a<00:03:39.330> bad<00:03:39.450> team<00:03:39.690> but<00:03:39.810> in<00:03:39.900> terms<00:03:40.020> of

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
not a bad team but in terms of

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.870 
not a bad team but in terms of
defensively<00:03:40.530> I<00:03:40.650> had<00:03:40.830> him<00:03:41.040> unless<00:03:41.400> Scott<00:03:41.670> and

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
defensively I had him unless Scott and

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.460 
defensively I had him unless Scott and
then<00:03:42.300> I<00:03:42.390> switched<00:03:42.660> it<00:03:42.780> around<00:03:42.840> with<00:03:43.170> him<00:03:43.200> and

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
then I switched it around with him and

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.990 
then I switched it around with him and
Cahill<00:03:43.860> now<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.040> only<00:03:44.370> issue<00:03:44.520> i<00:03:44.610> did<00:03:44.820> find

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
Cahill now the only issue i did find

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.720 
Cahill now the only issue i did find
again<00:03:45.300> as<00:03:45.990> a<00:03:46.050> weakness<00:03:46.350> of<00:03:46.590> his<00:03:46.740> is<00:03:46.950> he<00:03:47.490> sort<00:03:47.700> of

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
again as a weakness of his is he sort of

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.130 
again as a weakness of his is he sort of
hides<00:03:48.000> at<00:03:48.210> points<00:03:48.510> at<00:03:48.570> the<00:03:48.600> time<00:03:48.900> and<00:03:49.050> he

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
hides at points at the time and he

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.190 
hides at points at the time and he
occasionally<00:03:50.030> doesn't<00:03:51.030> make<00:03:51.150> his<00:03:51.690> presence

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
occasionally doesn't make his presence

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.710 
occasionally doesn't make his presence
felt<00:03:52.260> in<00:03:52.680> defense<00:03:53.070> so<00:03:53.480> he<00:03:54.480> would<00:03:54.570> sometimes

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
felt in defense so he would sometimes

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.450 
felt in defense so he would sometimes
hide<00:03:55.080> behind<00:03:55.230> Cahill<00:03:55.710> a<00:03:55.740> bit<00:03:55.950> too<00:03:56.100> much<00:03:56.250> that's

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:56.460 
hide behind Cahill a bit too much that's

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.130 
hide behind Cahill a bit too much that's
why<00:03:56.610> i<00:03:56.640> put<00:03:56.760> in<00:03:56.880> Lescott<00:03:57.270> so<00:03:57.750> their<00:03:57.930> paces

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
why i put in Lescott so their paces

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.100 
why i put in Lescott so their paces
would<00:03:58.440> match<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:59.360> on<00:04:00.360> occasion<00:04:00.840> then<00:04:00.990> you'd

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
would match and on occasion then you'd

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.930 
would match and on occasion then you'd
see<00:04:01.290> that<00:04:01.470> he<00:04:01.560> would<00:04:01.830> put<00:04:02.190> himself<00:04:02.310> forward<00:04:02.730> so

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
see that he would put himself forward so

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.810 
see that he would put himself forward so
going<00:04:03.180> into<00:04:03.300> the<00:04:03.420> pros<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:04.050> cons<00:04:04.820> amazing

paces<00:04:30.930> again<00:04:31.170> another<00:04:31.350> issue<00:04:31.590> with<00:04:31.890> this<00:04:31.950> guy

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
paces again another issue with this guy

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.100 
paces again another issue with this guy
but<00:04:32.460> don't<00:04:33.090> let<00:04:33.240> that<00:04:33.270> put<00:04:33.510> you<00:04:33.570> off<00:04:33.630> his<00:04:33.810> card

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
but don't let that put you off his card

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.260 
but don't let that put you off his card
and<00:04:34.290> also<00:04:34.680> he's<00:04:35.130> got<00:04:35.310> a<00:04:35.340> low<00:04:35.520> presence<00:04:36.030> so

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
and also he's got a low presence so

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.940 
and also he's got a low presence so
sometimes<00:04:36.720> you<00:04:36.810> might<00:04:36.960> not<00:04:37.080> feel<00:04:37.350> him<00:04:37.560> being

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
sometimes you might not feel him being

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.620 
sometimes you might not feel him being
too<00:04:38.340> much<00:04:38.520> involved<00:04:38.880> into<00:04:39.030> the<00:04:39.120> game<00:04:39.330> so

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
too much involved into the game so

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.110 
too much involved into the game so
overall<00:04:40.290> I've<00:04:40.410> given<00:04:40.650> him<00:04:40.710> a<00:04:40.800> 9.1<00:04:41.310> rating<00:04:41.940> and

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
overall I've given him a 9.1 rating and

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.600 
overall I've given him a 9.1 rating and
I<00:04:42.840> think<00:04:42.900> that's<00:04:43.050> really<00:04:43.260> awesome<00:04:43.770> but<00:04:44.430> in

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
I think that's really awesome but in

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:45.980 
I think that's really awesome but in
comparison<00:04:44.760> to<00:04:45.150> him<00:04:45.300> and<00:04:45.450> motorcycle

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
comparison to him and motorcycle

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.320 
comparison to him and motorcycle
probably<00:04:46.320> say<00:04:46.470> go<00:04:46.740> at<00:04:46.860> Terry<00:04:47.130> and<00:04:47.400> then<00:04:48.060> a<00:04:48.090> poem

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
probably say go at Terry and then a poem

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.640 
probably say go at Terry and then a poem
alongside<00:04:48.540> whichever<00:04:49.020> other<00:04:49.200> play<00:04:49.410> you'd
