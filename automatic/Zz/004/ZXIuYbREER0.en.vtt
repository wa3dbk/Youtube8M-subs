 sausages under a thin layer of fragrant 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.670

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:21.810

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.720
 we will carry 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:53.130
 here it is actually sausage dough 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.410
 thin staty really thin 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:01.380
 do not say what's the use of such a thin 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:04.140
 that's sausage itself oh so cool it 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.470
 straight sausage small I thought that 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.540
 usual sausage take cut into batter and 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.510
 all repeat it straight sausage such 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:17.280
 little his i mean we're all inside 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.260
 like all edible take a goal but here 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.530
 so well 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.530
 no fluff no pen to the devil cast a spell 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:44.400
 Well guys but sausage of course here clearly 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.720
 not dairy not bavarian but not to say 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.659
 that straight and generally such deshmanskaya 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.180
 There are generally straightforward such sausages 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:54.989
 then often there are sausages who understand 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.390
 Sausage someone will understand me such 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.400
 things are like paper and this is very good 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.170
 kayfovy sausages not here shorter not the most 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.120
 deshmanskaya but not the most expensive such 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.290
 average 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:09.299
 such a taste would not be dairy 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.019
 Of course what would be a better sausage 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:15.720
 much tastier well, well, that is, you can 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:18.120
 the only sauce is anything sauce in order 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.060
 don't know about some kind of ketchup to the extreme 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:25.020
 it would be even okay but ottopchu 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:28.979
 normally will go 95 rubles well, not ice 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:31.710
 Of course supreme saliva is very strong 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:34.620
 it does not run to eat it well when there is
