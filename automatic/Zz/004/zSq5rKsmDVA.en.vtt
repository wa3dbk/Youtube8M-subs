and they're called color stick for eyes

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.470 
and they're called color stick for eyes
so<00:00:12.750> i<00:00:12.780> did<00:00:13.019> that<00:00:13.049> really<00:00:13.349> badly<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:14.179> i<00:00:15.179> bought

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
so i did that really badly and i bought

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.830 
so i did that really badly and i bought
three<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.780> them<00:00:16.130> these<00:00:17.130> were<00:00:17.630> actually<00:00:18.630> bought

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
three of them these were actually bought

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.320 
three of them these were actually bought
these<00:00:18.990> on<00:00:19.140> sale<00:00:19.439> so<00:00:20.369> they<00:00:20.520> were<00:00:20.580> 250<00:00:21.000> each<00:00:21.300> so
