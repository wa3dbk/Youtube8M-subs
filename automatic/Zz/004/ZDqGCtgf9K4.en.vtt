well I got this 2000 model Volkswagen

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.499 
well I got this 2000 model Volkswagen
Golf<00:00:03.870> GTI<00:00:04.410> in<00:00:04.710> for<00:00:04.950> the<00:00:05.040> problem<00:00:05.460> and<00:00:06.359> his

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
Golf GTI in for the problem and his

Golf GTI in for the problem and his
problem<00:00:06.839> isn't<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.620> tie<00:00:07.830> is<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:08.010> completely

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
problem isn't the tie is a completely

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.860 
problem isn't the tie is a completely
bowl<00:00:09.200> they've<00:00:10.200> got<00:00:10.380> another<00:00:10.620> issue<00:00:10.860> is<00:00:11.250> real

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
bowl they've got another issue is real

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.000 
bowl they've got another issue is real
the<00:00:12.870> real<00:00:12.900> nuts<00:00:13.230> are<00:00:13.440> all<00:00:13.530> tight<00:00:13.799> but<00:00:16.010> the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
the real nuts are all tight but the

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.200 
the real nuts are all tight but the
wheel<00:00:17.160> seems<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.580> be<00:00:17.779> flapping<00:00:18.779> around<00:00:20.210> the

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
wheel seems to be flapping around the

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.089 
wheel seems to be flapping around the
brakes<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.660> only<00:00:21.840> thing<00:00:21.990> holding<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.410> in<00:00:23.779> so

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
brakes the only thing holding it in so

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.310 
brakes the only thing holding it in so
let's<00:00:26.099> rip<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.369> apart<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.789> have<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.000> look<00:00:27.320> have

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
let's rip it apart and have a look have

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.080 
let's rip it apart and have a look have
to<00:00:28.500> pump<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.830> pedal<00:00:28.980> twice<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.670> actually<00:00:29.910> get

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
to pump the pedal twice to actually get

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.609 
to pump the pedal twice to actually get
a<00:00:30.119> pedal<00:00:30.510> because<00:00:30.779> it's<00:00:30.929> pushing<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.380> pads

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
a pedal because it's pushing the pads

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.410 
a pedal because it's pushing the pads
back<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.099> every<00:00:32.340> time<00:00:34.460> if<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.610> hold<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.969> air<00:00:36.180> can

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
back in every time if I hold the air can

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:51.529 
back in every time if I hold the air can
be<00:00:36.540> there<00:00:46.610> that's<00:00:47.610> his<00:00:50.210> well<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.239> got<00:00:51.449> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
be there that's his well I got the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.049 
be there that's his well I got the
wheel<00:00:51.690> off<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.230> drive<00:00:53.100> shutting<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.610> seems

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
wheel off and drive shutting that seems

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.990 
wheel off and drive shutting that seems
to<00:00:54.570> me<00:00:54.690> tight<00:00:55.070> put<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.100> grease<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.579> there<00:00:56.760> though

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
to me tight put a grease in there though

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.759 
to me tight put a grease in there though
it's<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.300> strange<00:00:58.250> calipers<00:00:59.250> tight<00:00:59.489> but<00:01:02.210> yeah

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
it's a strange calipers tight but yeah

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.550 
it's a strange calipers tight but yeah
like<00:01:04.769> there<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.040> no<00:01:05.220> real<00:01:05.460> bearing<00:01:05.729> anymore

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
like there is no real bearing anymore

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.740 
like there is no real bearing anymore
maybe<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.770> drive<00:01:08.040> shaft<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.520> flapping<00:01:08.909> around

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.450 

I<00:01:15.380> haven't<00:01:16.380> come<00:01:16.530> across<00:01:16.560> something<00:01:17.040> quite

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
I haven't come across something quite

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.030 
I haven't come across something quite
this<00:01:17.790> fast<00:01:18.119> before

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
this fast before

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.280 
this fast before
it's<00:01:20.040> got<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.189> coolant<00:01:20.610> leak<00:01:20.670> too<00:01:21.060> but<00:01:21.360> not<00:01:22.049> here

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
it's got a coolant leak too but not here

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.350 
it's got a coolant leak too but not here
for<00:01:22.439> that

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
for that

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.390 
for that
and<00:01:24.360> now<00:01:24.990> I'll<00:01:25.229> whip<00:01:25.409> off<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.740> caliper<00:01:26.189> and

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
and now I'll whip off the caliper and

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.350 
and now I'll whip off the caliper and
caliper<00:01:26.790> holder<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:28.880> I'll<00:01:29.880> take<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> rotor

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
caliper holder and I'll take the rotor

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.130 
caliper holder and I'll take the rotor
off<00:01:31.250> undo<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.369> drive<00:01:32.579> shaft<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.150> probably

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
off undo the drive shaft and probably

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.620 
off undo the drive shaft and probably
just<00:01:34.259> all<00:01:34.350> fall<00:01:34.530> apart<00:01:35.090> upside<00:01:36.090> it's<00:01:36.210> spun<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
just all fall apart upside it's spun the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.289 
just all fall apart upside it's spun the
bearing<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.439> everything<00:01:38.299> so

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
bearing and everything so

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.270 
bearing and everything so
probably<00:01:39.600> needs<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.840> whole<00:01:40.020> new<00:01:40.049> hub<00:01:40.710> assembly

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
probably needs a whole new hub assembly

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.859 
probably needs a whole new hub assembly
for<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.579> guide<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:44.119> can't<00:01:45.119> get<00:01:45.270> over<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.570> but

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
for this guide I can't get over that but

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.060 
for this guide I can't get over that but
someone<00:01:46.079> drove<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.619> like<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:49.040> through<00:01:50.040> the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
someone drove it like this through the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.620 
someone drove it like this through the
caliper<00:01:50.579> off<00:01:50.700> until<00:01:50.970> it's<00:01:51.119> really<00:01:51.240> holding

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
caliper off until it's really holding

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.679 
caliper off until it's really holding
out<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.899> moment<00:01:52.790> so<00:01:53.790> that's<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:54.030> Titan<00:01:54.329> caliper

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
out a moment so that's a Titan caliper

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.460 
out a moment so that's a Titan caliper
off<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:55.049> will<00:01:55.259> be<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.409> lot<00:01:55.590> worse

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.010 

now<00:01:59.400> I've<00:01:59.520> got<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.790> caliper<00:02:00.120> off<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.600> really

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
now I've got the caliper off that really

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:14.120 
now I've got the caliper off that really
shows<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:07.610> ya<00:02:09.170> exciting<00:02:12.590> you<00:02:13.590> can't<00:02:13.800> get<00:02:13.920> over

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
shows is ya exciting you can't get over

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.430 
shows is ya exciting you can't get over
that<00:02:14.160> actually<00:02:17.570> can<00:02:18.570> say<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.930> drive<00:02:19.140> shafts

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
that actually can say the drive shafts

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.690 
that actually can say the drive shafts
the<00:02:19.590> only<00:02:19.950> thing<00:02:20.100> holding<00:02:20.310> this<00:02:20.580> in<00:02:22.490> in<00:02:23.490> and

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
the only thing holding this in in and

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:31.970 
the only thing holding this in in and
out<00:02:23.850> quite<00:02:24.210> a<00:02:24.240> lot<00:02:27.230> evil<00:02:30.530> no<00:02:31.530> I<00:02:31.560> got<00:02:31.770> all<00:02:31.800> this

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
out quite a lot evil no I got all this

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.370 
out quite a lot evil no I got all this
apart<00:02:32.370> now<00:02:32.580> it's<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:33.330> bit<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.570> strange<00:02:33.900> design

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
apart now it's a bit of a strange design

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.360 
apart now it's a bit of a strange design
we've<00:02:35.040> got<00:02:35.160> two<00:02:35.340> ball<00:02:35.580> bearing<00:02:35.910> races<00:02:36.150> and

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
we've got two ball bearing races and

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.150 
we've got two ball bearing races and
they<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.970> know<00:02:39.030> one<00:02:39.270> goes<00:02:39.450> there<00:02:39.660> run<00:02:39.960> goes<00:02:40.160> on

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
they you know one goes there run goes on

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.390 
they you know one goes there run goes on
the<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.400> know<00:02:41.960> what's<00:02:42.960> happened<00:02:43.380> here<00:02:43.590> is<00:02:43.650> the

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
the you know what's happened here is the

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.220 
the you know what's happened here is the
inner<00:02:44.820> housing<00:02:45.590> spinning<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.900> was<00:02:49.020> pretty

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
inner housing spinning and it was pretty

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.010 
inner housing spinning and it was pretty
sloppy<00:02:49.590> inside<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:51.150> actual<00:02:51.390> race<00:02:51.630> hold<00:02:51.900> it

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
sloppy inside the actual race hold it

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.710 
sloppy inside the actual race hold it
here<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:53.600> also<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:56.700> outer<00:02:56.850> one<00:02:57.150> was<00:02:57.330> spinning

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
here and also the outer one was spinning

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.770 
here and also the outer one was spinning
too<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:59.280> it's<00:02:59.460> all<00:02:59.580> destroyed<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.450> pitted

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
too and it's all destroyed and pitted
