00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:07.649
 ok look according to I thought it was 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.090
 recording and it was not recorded and this unit the 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.059
 I had prepared and the truth already 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.170
 I finished and well no, well, it's not like that 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.570
 this 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.580
 then it helped me to explain to them that 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.090
 the base that you are going to put down has 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.220
 to be in natural nail in natural nail or 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.990
 in a french nail because if they put it in 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.000
 crystal will be left as an effect 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.010
 stained glass or they're going to have to give them 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.070
 enough layers then with the natural 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.829
 and with the one and with the french one is very 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.860
 well apart they are bright colors and 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.840
 they are very good and if you dry fast 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.110
 a girl from facebook I wonder and if 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.800
 they dry fast and in the post now I already like 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.040
 from now is this color that is here and 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.470
 Well let's start 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.410
 let's grab our brush we're going 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.900
 to moisten a little on the fret cited 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.230
 and we're going to download here and we're going to 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.230
 grab 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:09.290
 let's grab what is being 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:12.500
 I'm going to be holding it right here 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.770
 like a semicircle and then later I 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.930
 clean to clean I'll grab the other 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.830
 brush that he told them he took away what 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.520
 moistened 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.330
 and in small circles I'm not going to 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.330
 start sweeping 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.060
 to blur what I'm going to have I have to 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.300
 start pulling that down the base 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:39.010
 it has to be in acrylic paint the 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.630
 base that we have below if it is with enamel 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:46.220
 Well, if you have that soft girls but 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.110
 the truth is with good me like that to me like this 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.800
 I got the effect 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:56.140
 then with acrylic paintings look 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:58.990
 then we finish the other semicircle 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.570
 and we moisten again 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.020
 and then later we are going to pull towards 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.020
 above 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.340
 but it's like little touches I'm not going to 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:13.480
 do with full force because if you do not 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.700
 they are going to take it they are going to take the color 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.280
 then this and then we go back to 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.830
 clean our brush we grab another 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.470
 white paint 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.950
 and nothing else in the middle look 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:32.510
 then the can know in the middle and then 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:35.319
 here look in the part of here up ok 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.549
 let's do it again 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:41.549
 we grab black paint we make a 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.549
 semicircle 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.239
 let's grab the other brush a 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:51.359
 moisten download and with circles with 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.770
 we are going to sweep it towards 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.320
 down 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.160
 we clean we moisten again 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.160
 to remove the excess 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.770
 or that when we already have this, so 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.709
 it makes like a black circle that because what 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.819
 we blur and the poplars this let's 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:14.030
 grab the white paint 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:17.900
 and let's make the semicircle again 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:20.540
 now with white this is to give them light 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.819
 same we do the same thing we have to 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.159
 clean the brush moisten it and what now 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:29.870
 we 're going to pull it up now it 's 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:31.970
 like snails up so we're going 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.590
 to do it up we return to 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.190
 clean 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.100
 and again 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.240
 ok here we go again grab the other 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:46.390
 thin brush 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.600
 and we go to the semicircle 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:53.550
 we do it like this 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:55.730
 ok this is this is the effect you have 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.860
 who liked it and nothing else we put 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.560
 little dots or whatever you want 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.230
 this is just an idea and is a basis for 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.720
 can do enough things then 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.910
 this this and nothing else when it dries 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.930
 because it dries pretty fast we're going 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:17.630
 to put a mole here in the part 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:20.850
 above and we already finished it like this 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.880
 this is practice here the joke 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.730
 is the blurred because if we do not 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.970
 Let's go well, it's not going to fit us and this is 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.289
 of practice look here practically you 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.960
 he has just finished 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:39.100
 and there it is 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:41.800
 and this is how we are going to finish it 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.660
 in that neighborhood because a little bit 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.440
 acrylic paint but then nothing happens 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.440
 here we can put it 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.580
 I do not know other droplets and nothing happens 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.260
 we have to also know how to fix the 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.720
 the little details that we are 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.080
 they come out and then if they like it 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.110
 share subscribe and this guy god the 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.110
 bless 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.479
