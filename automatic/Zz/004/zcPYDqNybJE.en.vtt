00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
demonstrate with die rise and like I

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.950 
demonstrate with die rise and like I
said<00:00:34.050> before<00:00:34.760> this<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.820> just<00:00:36.149> demonstration

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
said before this is just demonstration

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.580 
said before this is just demonstration
but<00:00:37.590> um<00:00:37.850> what<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.879> did<00:00:39.239> before<00:00:39.750> mob<00:00:40.260> with<00:00:40.410> her

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
but um what I did before mob with her

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.369 
but um what I did before mob with her
before<00:00:40.920> die<00:00:41.309> rise<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.570> went<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.989> system<00:00:43.350> link

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
before die rise is I went to system link

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.160 
before die rise is I went to system link
to<00:00:44.129> get<00:00:44.280> used<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.730> map<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.539> wouldn't<00:00:45.960> count

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
to get used to the map so wouldn't count

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.260 
to get used to the map so wouldn't count
to<00:00:46.320> my<00:00:46.440> rank<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:46.950> if<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.129> got<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.399> down<00:00:47.579> because<00:00:48.090> I

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
to my rank so if I got it down because I

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.410 
to my rank so if I got it down because I
didn't<00:00:48.600> know<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.989> certain<00:00:49.289> thing<00:00:50.280> was<00:00:50.579> there<00:00:50.820> or

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
didn't know a certain thing was there or

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.600 
didn't know a certain thing was there or
let's<00:00:52.050> say<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.559> die<00:00:52.739> rise<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.250> could<00:00:53.370> fall

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
let's say and die rise you could fall

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.260 
let's say and die rise you could fall
off<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.510> building<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:55.140> did<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.190> lot<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:56.699> I

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
off the building I did that a lot so I

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.240 
off the building I did that a lot so I
just<00:00:57.719> didn't<00:00:58.350> want<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.710> count<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.100> my

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
just didn't want that to count to my

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.950 
just didn't want that to count to my
rank<00:00:59.520> so<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.120> what<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.750> what's<00:01:00.870> a

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
rank so this is what it and what's a

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.650 
rank so this is what it and what's a
system<00:01:01.350> link<00:01:01.469> before<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.980> map<00:01:02.160> or<00:01:02.629> before<00:01:03.629> I

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
system link before the map or before I

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.440 
system link before the map or before I
start<00:01:03.960> playing<00:01:04.229> xbox<00:01:04.799> live<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.610> it's<00:01:06.270> pretty

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
start playing xbox live and it's pretty

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.300 
start playing xbox live and it's pretty
easy<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.780> do<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.229> hit<00:01:07.560> system<00:01:07.979> link<00:01:08.159> and

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
easy to do you just hit system link and

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.399 
easy to do you just hit system link and
then<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.490> say<00:01:08.700> create<00:01:09.150> game<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.689> then<00:01:10.290> you

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
then you say create game and then you

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.080 
then you say create game and then you
could<00:01:10.500> do<00:01:10.680> your<00:01:10.890> difficulty<00:01:11.490> whatever<00:01:11.909> you

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
could do your difficulty whatever you

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.660 
could do your difficulty whatever you
want<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.080> think<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.830> only<00:01:14.100> way

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
want and I think this is the only way

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.140 
want and I think this is the only way
you<00:01:14.729> can<00:01:15.000> make<00:01:15.210> die<00:01:15.630> rise<00:01:15.930> easy<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:17.220> yeah<00:01:17.820> but

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
you can make die rise easy so yeah but

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.170 
you can make die rise easy so yeah but
I'm<00:01:18.500> anyway<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.640> what<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.820> recommend

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
I'm anyway so this is what I recommend

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.630 
I'm anyway so this is what I recommend
doing<00:01:21.509> if<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.380> want<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.799> keep<00:01:23.100> your<00:01:23.310> zombie

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
doing if you want to keep your zombie

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.130 
doing if you want to keep your zombie
rank<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.090> get<00:01:24.360> used<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.750> mob<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.080> dead

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
rank and get used to mob of the dead

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.620 
rank and get used to mob of the dead
because<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.280> inevitable<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.030> you're

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
because it is inevitable that you're

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.450 
because it is inevitable that you're
going<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.900> get<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.110> lot<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.439> downs<00:01:28.740> if<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.189> just

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
going to get a lot of downs if you just

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.850 
going to get a lot of downs if you just
go<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.670> xbox<00:01:30.090> live<00:01:30.299> into<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> random<00:01:30.840> game<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.409> I

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
go to xbox live into a random game and I

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.160 
go to xbox live into a random game and I
actually<00:01:32.240> recommend<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.020> it's

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
actually recommend this and it's

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.800 
actually recommend this and it's
actually<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.619> smarter<00:01:35.070> way<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.630> do<00:01:36.630> this

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
actually a smarter way to do this

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.800 
actually a smarter way to do this
because<00:01:37.079> if<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:38.189> don't<00:01:38.460> want<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.909> die<00:01:39.630> on

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
because if you don't want to die on

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.270 
because if you don't want to die on
round<00:01:40.049> two<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.530> have<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.890> show<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
round two and have it show on the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.420 
round two and have it show on the
leaderboards<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.930> your<00:01:43.920> friends<00:01:44.310> won't

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
leaderboards and you your friends won't

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.340 
leaderboards and you your friends won't
be<00:01:44.700> bragging<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.479> they<00:01:45.659> got<00:01:45.899> higher<00:01:46.110> than

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
be bragging that they got higher than

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.920 
be bragging that they got higher than
you<00:01:46.470> or<00:01:46.619> something<00:01:46.890> like<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.869> hope<00:01:48.869> you

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930
