tires we can check our tire tread by

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.120 
tires we can check our tire tread by
using<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.600> penny<00:01:34.810> so<00:01:35.260> what<00:01:35.440> we<00:01:35.530> do<00:01:35.680> is<00:01:35.710> we<00:01:35.950> take

using the penny so what we do is we take

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.920 
using the penny so what we do is we take
this<00:01:36.310> penny<00:01:36.580> right<00:01:36.850> here<00:01:37.090> and<00:01:37.240> we<00:01:37.390> stick<00:01:37.690> it<00:01:37.720> in

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
this penny right here and we stick it in

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.260 
this penny right here and we stick it in
between<00:01:38.050> the<00:01:38.380> tire<00:01:38.560> tread<00:01:38.980> like<00:01:39.190> that<00:01:39.490> and<00:01:39.910> we

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
between the tire tread like that and we

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.580 
between the tire tread like that and we
see<00:01:40.510> if<00:01:40.600> we<00:01:40.690> could<00:01:40.840> see<00:01:40.960> the<00:01:41.080> top<00:01:41.290> of<00:01:41.440> his<00:01:41.560> head

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
see if we could see the top of his head

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.950

if we could see the top of his head that

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.090 
if we could see the top of his head that
means<00:01:44.170> you<00:01:44.290> need<00:01:44.410> a<00:01:44.470> new<00:01:44.650> tire
