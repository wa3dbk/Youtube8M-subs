00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
wasn't sure to be honest because you

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.760 
wasn't sure to be honest because you
don't<00:01:14.939> know<00:01:15.090> if<00:01:15.270> lap<00:01:15.450> traffic<00:01:15.720> but<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.350> could

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
maneuver quite good for him so I wasn't

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.050 
maneuver quite good for him so I wasn't
concerned<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:20.040> tried<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.369> kept<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.700> race<00:01:20.850> pace

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
concerned I tried to kept the race pace

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.420 
concerned I tried to kept the race pace
at<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> nice<00:01:21.509> comfortable<00:01:21.840> thing<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.830> wasn't

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
at a nice comfortable thing so I wasn't

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.770 
at a nice comfortable thing so I wasn't
getting<00:01:23.490> muddled<00:01:23.790> up<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.330> then<00:01:24.450> just<00:01:24.570> right

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
getting muddled up and then just right

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.469 
getting muddled up and then just right
there<00:01:24.930> at<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.049> end<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.350> nearly<00:01:26.150> got<00:01:27.150> bottled

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
there at the end of nearly got bottled

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.149 
there at the end of nearly got bottled
up<00:01:27.540> but<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:28.439> know<00:01:28.590> they're<00:01:28.770> definitely<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
up but you know they're definitely the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.460 
up but you know they're definitely the
start<00:01:29.400> was<00:01:29.549> important<00:01:30.030> but<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.479> think<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.320> had

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
start was important but I think you had

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.990 
start was important but I think you had
to<00:01:31.560> be<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.799> maneuverable<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.460> traffic<00:01:32.850> to

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
to be in a maneuverable to traffic to

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.020 
to be in a maneuverable to traffic to
win<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.270> race<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:34.189> you<00:01:35.189> know<00:01:35.340> if<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.909> were

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
win the race so you know if you were

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
that so hopefully we could build on this

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.420 
that so hopefully we could build on this
and<00:03:59.569> continue<00:03:59.930> to<00:04:00.260> run<00:04:00.410> good<00:04:00.620> as<00:04:01.190> we're

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
and continue to run good as we're

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.680 
and continue to run good as we're
standing<00:04:01.549> on<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:01.910> racetrack<00:04:02.060> there's<00:04:02.480> still

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
standing on the racetrack there's still

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.720 
standing on the racetrack there's still
a<00:04:02.720> lot<00:04:03.019> of<00:04:03.049> grip<00:04:03.379> in<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:03.560> track<00:04:03.889> is<00:04:04.099> it<00:04:04.310> harder

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
a lot of grip in the track is it harder

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.030 
a lot of grip in the track is it harder
to<00:04:04.760> pass<00:04:05.060> when<00:04:05.359> there's<00:04:05.540> so<00:04:05.690> much<00:04:05.840> grip<00:04:06.139> yeah<00:04:07.010> i

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
to pass when there's so much grip yeah i

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.099 
to pass when there's so much grip yeah i
think<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:07.639> track<00:04:08.000> was<00:04:08.239> again<00:04:08.480> you<00:04:08.989> know

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
think the track was again you know

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:10.629 
think the track was again you know
heavier<00:04:09.440> and<00:04:09.560> heavier<00:04:09.680> as<00:04:09.919> the<00:04:10.069> race<00:04:10.220> went<00:04:10.250> on

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
heavier and heavier as the race went on

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:11.059 
heavier and heavier as the race went on
it

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
it

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.640 
it
group<00:04:11.400> kind<00:04:11.640> of<00:04:11.730> moved<00:04:11.909> down<00:04:11.999> so<00:04:12.540> you<00:04:13.290> kind<00:04:13.560> of

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
group kind of moved down so you kind of

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.009 
group kind of moved down so you kind of
slow<00:04:13.950> to<00:04:14.010> your<00:04:14.219> pace<00:04:14.459> down<00:04:14.760> but<00:04:15.150> which<00:04:15.780> made
