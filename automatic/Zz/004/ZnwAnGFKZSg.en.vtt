and<00:01:50.100> all<00:01:50.430> with<00:01:50.670> sharpies<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.479> just<00:01:52.020> wanted<00:01:52.259> to

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
and all with sharpies I just wanted to

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.020 
and all with sharpies I just wanted to
do<00:01:52.560> something<00:01:52.829> bright<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.280> bold<00:01:53.610> after

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
do something bright and bold after

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.090 
do something bright and bold after
spending<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.140> few<00:01:55.170> days<00:01:55.470> with<00:01:55.530> just<00:01:55.890> black<00:01:56.009> and

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
spending a few days with just black and

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.630 
spending a few days with just black and
white<00:01:56.340> when<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.670> did<00:01:56.909> my<00:01:57.060> 8x8<00:01:57.659> project<00:01:58.369> so<00:01:59.369> I

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
white when I did my 8x8 project so I

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.999 
white when I did my 8x8 project so I
chose<00:02:00.360> some<00:02:00.630> green<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.320> green<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.860> my

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
chose some green and green is my

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.440 
chose some green and green is my
favorite<00:02:02.040> color<00:02:02.490> if<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.000> didn't<00:02:03.299> know<00:02:03.420> that

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
favorite color if you didn't know that

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.950 
favorite color if you didn't know that
so<00:02:04.369> you'll<00:02:05.369> probably<00:02:05.579> be<00:02:06.090> seeing<00:02:06.329> quite<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.899> bit

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
so you'll probably be seeing quite a bit

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.340 
so you'll probably be seeing quite a bit
of<00:02:07.140> green

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
of green

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.460 
of green
