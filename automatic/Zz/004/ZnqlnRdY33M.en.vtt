00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.029
 that still youtube friends on this day 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:11.519
 I'm going to introduce you how to make a new 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:15.650
 clan and integrate as you want 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.810
 in big class good youtube friends 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.300
 better I go a little bad video but 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.420
 well I will teach you how to make one 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.230
 search 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.330
 good to start, they leave if 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.119
 you have already built the castle 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.630
 of the clan see here says the castle of 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:38.440
 good clan are going to see where clan says 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.690
 good first of all that we under pressure 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.400
 several to which we can integrate 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.530
 several clans and because the truth is very 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.000
 well we are going to give you here 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.000
 arribita where it says that here 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:58.320
 to begin what name do you have 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:03.020
 in the case I discussed it with a 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.020
 partner and we decided to put him from time 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.130
 you should not mexican grant 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:13.200
 but apparently a while ago I tried 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.840
 place then all that and I could not 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.030
 Unfortunately, it has a limit of 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:24.140
 spaces or letters and then we are going to 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:27.470
 have to make another maneuver no other 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.150
 well you could say remove some 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.780
 letters 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.500
 and now I'm going to put 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.500
 you must 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.060
 sometimes 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:48.850
 it's mx 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:54.810
 mx and then to this name you could go 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.810
 you could be integrated 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:02.770
 well here apparently so 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.770
 Y 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.180
 to have click on the ballots 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:12.360
 unfortunately that is what happens not 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.290
 they can do many cases because it's something 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.680
 very unfortunate 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.010
 in that aspect it would have to improve 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.970
 everything that would be the creation 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.150
 of plans but especially in the name 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.150
 do not 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
 x 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.520
 good and 3 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.770
 maybe mx what better 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.780
 translated into Spanish would be a better 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:48.220
 Mexican 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.860
 yes 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:56.380
 if you say no 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.380
 a simple description then 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.370
 no i'm not like that much 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.370
 inspiration 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.920
 let's put him alone 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.459
 the best 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.970
 Y 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:32.060
 well I had not commented before but 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.000
 Well, I'm from Tlaxcala then 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.280
 more or less that way if you are from 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.880
 other states or countries that are 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.770
 Seeing here, they can be integrated 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.630
 this clan 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.520
 I'll leave you here in the description 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.630
 the name of the channel 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.900
 good for you to be able 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:54.350
 integrate and well I do not know maybe I would 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.450
 send their names their names of 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.800
 their clans that they have made and then the 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.530
 I can visit 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.550
 that was still 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.530
 and let's look for a flag to make me 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:10.010
 I was watching for a while and I like it 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:13.030
 this and then I'm going to make it public a 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.030
 trophy limit 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:23.060
 600 to not be very good I'm a bad thing 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:25.310
 really good let's continue with this 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.710
 which is the creation of our clan and 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.650
 Well, I like the frequency of war 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.840
 do it always though with my old 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.130
 clan that was barbarians 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.540
 mexican this one we always lost 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.180
 location then let's put it here 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.520
 our cute and dear mexico 'we are going to 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.229
 look for it 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.229
 and then it is 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:58.110
 here in Mexico and it will cost us 40 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:05:00.300
 a thousand gold coins or pesos I do not know how 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:04.380
 you want to tell him but then to 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:07.320
 It costs us costs us 40 thousand 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.230
 coins and we're going 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.510
 and our clan will automatically be 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.150
 fact 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:17.890
 and so 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:20.280
 now the clan information everything I am 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:24.409
 the only member 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:30.559
 and then we can this 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:33.180
 I do not know how to look anymore, we can not avoid 

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:36.720
 here trophies 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:39.449
 man the good symbol would be what 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.419
 main not equal we can invite to 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:45.870
 others 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:49.020
 and so not good this would be basically 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:52.190
 all the most important thing also if 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.190
 they want so 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:06:01.810
 we have not sent anything they link me I'm 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.810
 as in the place 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.100
 a lot down good 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:14.040
 there's a good place, well, basically 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:17.250
 as I said earlier would be what 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:20.100
 more important we would be fine we could 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:23.940
 like to look for a war against 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:26.510
 start war there is for everyone what 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.510
 following 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:33.050
 that would be basically all friends of 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:35.950
 youtube subscribe like and join 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:40.340
 my channel really is very cool and 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:43.630
 well to win these wars and then what else 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.630
 it would be everything until later
