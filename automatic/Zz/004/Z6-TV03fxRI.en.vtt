00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
which is like a huge estimate then you

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.890 
which is like a huge estimate then you
should<00:02:32.730> cut<00:02:32.880> down<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.210> middle<00:02:33.360> so<00:02:33.630> it<00:02:33.660> might

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
should cut down the middle so it might

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.500 
should cut down the middle so it might
be<00:02:33.930> around<00:02:34.320> 4k<00:02:34.710> per<00:02:35.640> day<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:36.120> that's<00:02:36.270> a<00:02:36.330> lot<00:02:36.480> of

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
be around 4k per day and that's a lot of

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.450 
be around 4k per day and that's a lot of
money<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:37.020> per<00:02:37.350> year<00:02:37.560> he<00:02:37.800> should<00:02:37.950> be<00:02:38.070> making

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
money and per year he should be making

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.770 
money and per year he should be making
at<00:02:38.580> least<00:02:40.040> 191<00:02:41.040> thousand<00:02:42.030> dollars<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.510> around

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
at least 191 thousand dollars to around

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.980 
at least 191 thousand dollars to around
to<00:02:43.110> hunt<00:02:43.320> 2<00:02:43.620> million<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.900> 300,000<00:02:45.900> dollars

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
to hunt 2 million and 300,000 dollars

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.900 
to hunt 2 million and 300,000 dollars
per<00:02:46.410> year<00:02:46.440> so<00:02:46.770> that's<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:47.250> big<00:02:47.430> range<00:02:47.700> as<00:02:47.880> well

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
per year so that's a big range as well

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.090 
per year so that's a big range as well
but<00:02:48.720> he<00:02:48.990> should<00:02:49.170> be<00:02:49.200> making<00:02:49.440> down<00:02:49.740> the<00:02:49.890> middle

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
but he should be making down the middle

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.449 
but he should be making down the middle
so<00:02:50.370> maybe<00:02:50.580> around<00:02:51.560> I'll<00:02:52.560> say<00:02:52.830> around<00:02:53.100> 1

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
so maybe around I'll say around 1

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.000 
so maybe around I'll say around 1
