00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.179
 good guys says and we have already done 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:17.160
 get information on what butterfield 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.800
 4 is assuming in the sector of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.500
 video game more than six prizes before 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.869
 reach the market make it clear that the fps 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.730
 it's going to blow up the sales lists and 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.649
 part of those good impressions of 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.590
 game are the consequence of having 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:35.940
 introduced a technology called the 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.070
 evolution and evolution is the name 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.440
 which says it has given a physical engine 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.550
 used in butterfield 4 as you can 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.559
 see in the video 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.809
 allows you to create dynamic scenarios and 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.989
 destructible thanks to the interaction of 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.730
 the characters and their weapons is to say yes 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.069
 we shoot for example a grenade launcher 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.019
 against a building it will fall or 

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:57.239
 will shed concrete blocks on the 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.699
 floor we can also cause blackouts 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.889
 in a garage firing the generator 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.199
 tear down a column to improvise 

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:06.450
 a ramp up close a door in 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.770
 case of being attacked and dozens 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.679
 of more options 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.630
 the illusion is definitely a system 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:16.149
 able to modify the initial scenario 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.610
 and make the physics match what 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:21.039
 what would happen in a real scenario in the 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.630
 same conditions is to say that if 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.689
 someone causes a collapse by my side and 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.939
 I am below has crush this to weigh 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.890
 to be logical in real life 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.869
 currently it was only given in sequences 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.899
 kinematics programmed at the level of 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.360
 games attack the felix 4 evolution 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.969
 allows those incidents to happen to be 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.250
 part of the action and in real time and 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:44.110
 this is in my opinion what makes 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.729
 a game jump or not of level and of 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.729
 generation and it seems to you
