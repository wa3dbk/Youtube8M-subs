gelatine added to it so it's solidified
so<00:02:30.200> although<00:02:30.709> that<00:02:30.860> this<00:02:31.190> shape<00:02:31.459> now<00:02:32.230> because

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
so although that this shape now because

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.100 
so although that this shape now because
the<00:02:33.349> soupy<00:02:33.620> nurse<00:02:33.769> is<00:02:34.010> a<00:02:34.489> solid<00:02:35.239> when<00:02:35.959> they've

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
the soupy nurse is a solid when they've

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.930 
the soupy nurse is a solid when they've
been<00:02:36.140> steamed<00:02:36.530> it<00:02:36.920> turns<00:02:37.129> to<00:02:37.220> a<00:02:37.340> liquid<00:02:37.549> so

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
been steamed it turns to a liquid so

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.300 
been steamed it turns to a liquid so
they<00:02:38.060> change<00:02:38.329> shape<00:02:38.420> which<00:02:39.349> is<00:02:39.379> why<00:02:39.680> in<00:02:40.069> this

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
they change shape which is why in this

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.050 
they change shape which is why in this
shot<00:02:40.609> we're<00:02:40.910> hoping<00:02:41.269> to<00:02:41.329> get<00:02:41.599> I<00:02:42.940> don't<00:02:43.940> know<00:02:44.000> if

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
shot we're hoping to get I don't know if

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.640 
shot we're hoping to get I don't know if
it's<00:02:44.390> going<00:02:44.480> to<00:02:44.540> be<00:02:44.629> possible<00:02:44.840> but<00:02:45.500> we're

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
it's going to be possible but we're

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.470 
it's going to be possible but we're
hoping<00:02:46.069> to<00:02:46.129> get<00:02:46.310> sort<00:02:46.579> of<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.910> dumplings<00:02:47.329> in

hoping to get sort of the dumplings in

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.750 
hoping to get sort of the dumplings in
various<00:02:47.840> stages<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:49.220> what<00:02:49.489> you<00:02:49.609> have<00:02:49.700> to

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
various stages and what you have to

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.690 
various stages and what you have to
consider<00:02:50.030> when<00:02:50.239> you're<00:02:50.359> sitting<00:02:50.599> up<00:02:50.660> a<00:02:50.780> shot

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
consider when you're sitting up a shot

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.940 
consider when you're sitting up a shot
you<00:02:52.700> have<00:02:53.510> to<00:02:53.540> make<00:02:53.780> sure<00:02:53.959> that<00:02:54.290> all<00:02:54.709> of<00:02:54.859> the

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
ingredients can be seen so it's

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.650 
ingredients can be seen so it's
something<00:02:57.859> like<00:02:58.010> this<00:02:58.400> we<00:02:58.880> might<00:02:59.180> break<00:02:59.450> it

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
something like this we might break it

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.100 
something like this we might break it
open

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.710

inside yeah its shape its depths this is

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.170 
inside yeah its shape its depths this is
from<00:03:08.870> my<00:03:09.020> platoon<00:03:09.380> Leslie<00:03:10.010> and<00:03:10.250> do<00:03:10.820> work<00:03:11.000> with

Paul to fit up the shorts like you

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.260 
Paul to fit up the shorts like you

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.560 
decide beforehand what angle you're
gonna<00:03:14.390> take<00:03:14.660> it<00:03:14.780> from<00:03:15.020> yes<00:03:15.290> we<00:03:15.800> do<00:03:15.980> that<00:03:16.190> I<00:03:16.640> do

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
gonna take it from yes we do that I do

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:23.020 
gonna take it from yes we do that I do
like<00:03:17.870> to<00:03:17.900> take<00:03:18.830> over<00:03:19.150> colors<00:03:20.150> yeah<00:03:22.030> the

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
like to take over colors yeah the

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.730 
like to take over colors yeah the
background<00:03:23.510> I<00:03:23.690> think<00:03:23.720> you<00:03:24.080> probably<00:03:24.230> one<00:03:24.710> of

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740 
background I think you probably one of

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.080 
background I think you probably one of
the<00:03:24.860> most<00:03:24.950> important<00:03:25.400> so<00:03:25.490> we<00:03:25.610> think<00:03:25.730> about<00:03:25.880> the

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
the most important so we think about the

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.490 
the most important so we think about the
background<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:26.570> colors<00:03:26.840> but<00:03:27.020> the<00:03:27.110> real<00:03:27.230> clash

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
background the colors but the real clash

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.490 
background the colors but the real clash
whether<00:03:27.860> it'll<00:03:28.100> enhance<00:03:29.350> bring<00:03:30.350> out

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
whether it'll enhance bring out

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:40.210 
whether it'll enhance bring out
everything<00:03:31.010> a<00:03:31.070> new<00:03:31.750> dish<00:03:34.959> stunning<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:39.220> next

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
mantiques relic relics and so for this

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.250 
mantiques relic relics and so for this
book<00:03:43.820> for<00:03:44.000> instance<00:03:44.090> a<00:03:44.510> lot<00:03:44.810> of<00:03:44.870> the<00:03:45.020> food<00:03:45.170> is

them least ways to shoot food what
angles<00:04:03.170> what<00:04:03.380> kind<00:04:03.530> of<00:04:03.620> lighting<00:04:04.040> because<00:04:04.340> we

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
angles what kind of lighting because we

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.880 
angles what kind of lighting because we
do<00:04:04.550> some<00:04:04.760> overhead<00:04:05.150> shots<00:04:05.420> don't<00:04:05.630> we<00:04:05.860> yeah<00:04:06.860> I

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
do some overhead shots don't we yeah I

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.710 
do some overhead shots don't we yeah I
think<00:04:07.100> it's<00:04:07.400> nice<00:04:07.519> to<00:04:07.760> mix<00:04:07.910> up<00:04:08.090> I<00:04:08.239> mean<00:04:08.420> clearly

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
think it's nice to mix up I mean clearly

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.949 
think it's nice to mix up I mean clearly
not<00:04:08.959> everything<00:04:09.290> works<00:04:09.530> over<00:04:09.980> here<00:04:13.299> something

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
not everything works over here something

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.140 
not everything works over here something
nice<00:04:15.379> traffic<00:04:15.920> I<00:04:16.009> read<00:04:16.190> I<00:04:16.430> think<00:04:16.880> the<00:04:16.970> main

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
nice traffic I read I think the main

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.150 
nice traffic I read I think the main
thing<00:04:17.180> is<00:04:17.449> just<00:04:17.570> have<00:04:17.930> a<00:04:17.959> look<00:04:18.199> before<00:04:18.919> you

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
thing is just have a look before you

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.580 
thing is just have a look before you
pick<00:04:19.340> up<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.609> camera<00:04:20.169> just<00:04:21.169> how<00:04:21.259> about<00:04:21.470> what

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
pick up the camera just how about what

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.650 
pick up the camera just how about what
it<00:04:21.680> actually<00:04:21.829> looks<00:04:22.070> like<00:04:22.370> I<00:04:22.789> think<00:04:23.389> people

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
it actually looks like I think people

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.270 
it actually looks like I think people
get<00:04:25.000> very<00:04:26.000> interested<00:04:26.539> in<00:04:26.660> the<00:04:27.410> fire<00:04:27.620> text<00:04:28.009> so

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
get very interested in the fire text so

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.210 
get very interested in the fire text so
I<00:04:28.310> then<00:04:29.020> be<00:04:30.020> brave<00:04:30.289> enough<00:04:30.530> to<00:04:30.770> move<00:04:30.889> it<00:04:31.070> around

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
I then be brave enough to move it around

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:50.399 
I then be brave enough to move it around
a<00:04:31.610> bit

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:50.409 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:52.469 

you
