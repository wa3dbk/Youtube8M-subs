00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.240 
right
I<00:02:58.459> put<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.610> good<00:02:59.790> edges<00:03:00.060> together<00:03:00.209> like<00:03:00.810> that

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
I put the good edges together like that

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.070 
I put the good edges together like that
I'd<00:03:02.250> clamped<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:02.850> using<00:03:03.270> the<00:03:03.360> seat<00:03:03.540> clamp<00:03:03.780> and

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
I'd clamped it using the seat clamp and

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.600 
I'd clamped it using the seat clamp and
then<00:03:05.040> I<00:03:05.069> grind<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.090> dump<00:03:06.300> so<00:03:06.450> they're<00:03:06.600> both

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
then I grind the dump so they're both

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.490 
then I grind the dump so they're both
the<00:03:08.610> exact<00:03:09.090> same<00:03:09.120> length

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500
