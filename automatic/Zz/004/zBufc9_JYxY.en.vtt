00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 trav today at molsheim chez natacha 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.040
 andréani hello natta load 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.660
 we saw you Saturday the voice 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.849
 the Alsatian we have been following since 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.790
 how was this Saturday 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.320
 so for you times Saturday times to 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.820
 twists because there have been 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.470
 changes up to the last 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.689
 minute so well that's always the job 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.890
 job job but it was I was 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.390
 really very satisfied with the song 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.310
 I was so happy with the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.050
 feedback from coaches 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.660
 so another nice Saturday 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.130
 and yet you take out the wii yet 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.469
 I'm going out yeah but it's going badly for a 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.910
 well because already I was expecting a 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.710
 little one must always prepare and then 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.790
 I say to myself that with hindsight I 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.320
 maybe I have maybe more 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.570
 great thing to ride to show at the level 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.879
 covers and also want to show 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.860
 my universe through my composites the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.200
 choice of the song is it wise not 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.100
 badly of internet ur of beef song 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.930
 not necessarily the most unifying a low 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.640
 it is true that to choose since it is 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.129
 the public chose this week the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.480
 song I would have chosen the second I 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.000
 think I could have shown more 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.100
 things and more surprise maybe 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.210
 yes if not birdy I had to sing 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.530
 but who have a chance too that 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.920
 I love and I regret nothing 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.590
 we find you and it's the big 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.670
 dilemma finally for elo coach and 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.710
 we others are there you 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.900
 find with flocked to that too 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.520
 the worst scenario that could have to 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.049
 for a moment we saw we were more than 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.060
 both of them he looked at me adie 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.759
 bombay an Alsatian who from I said 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.590
 yes there will be one but great 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.000
 happy because I want that blurry 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.450
 and up to the end of the neck which represents 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.920
 alsace and who really wins so 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.479
 no regrets really and then I was 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.950
 so happy that it is in india 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.470
 but three three friends who continues the 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.520
 adventure that here you are not in 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.140
 train to regulate body and you it's 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.770
 really it was nice it was really 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.359
 well 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.320
 yesterday that's what 's good 

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:48.369
 we are not at all competitive 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.170
 between my guy because we are so 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.689
 different than we could not get 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.340
 compare no really I know there's no 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.310
 that I'm not abusing it was really like 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.780
 what do you remember from these 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.670
 months spent at the voice 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.619
 it's true that it does not hurt me 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.140
 still it takes a bath to follow them 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.490
 on a life so eventually I have everything 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.649
 young man soon 20 years yeah that's 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.209
 it's almost 20 years ago that I remember that 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.650
 beautiful things because it already helped me 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.090
 to show me fewer men than I was 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.290
 able to do this job in front of as much 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.489
 of people because it's not this is 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.290
 no obviousness we want to make it 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.190
 profession but is what we are capable of 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.720
 sing in front of so many people 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.860
 and then especially to receive so many 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.709
 compliments from professionals 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.370
 well it can only boost forward so that 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.930
 positive 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.400
 do we come to realize that we 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.319
 spent several nights in a row 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.420
 in front of millions of french fillon 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.590
 I can not realize and during 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.209
 that I was in the car I told myself 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.370
 my god the day I'm going out I'm 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.720
 will say tomorrow if magic not I have not enough 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.860
 enjoy the present moment because 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.269
 I could not realize it's true 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.610
 that we are so always in the process of 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.430
 move here that I do not necessarily 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.900
 managed to have this click but it's true 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.220
 that no I still have not always 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.870
 even in front of the cameras the 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.030
 Saturday night that there were 7 million 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.530
 viewers who were watching no he 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.510
 better not finally I would have a 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.700
 tour of the voice is what you 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.620
 could be part of it no I could 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.850
 not to pass on this is definitive 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.380
 yeah that's definitive because that 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.750
 concerns all semi-finalists so 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.380
 the last eight to a good term of the four 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.329
 who breaks a leg 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.380
 that's it but I would not like their sounds 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:13.750
 ethereal but that's way the sequel to 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.000
 you now it's many 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.639
 true concerts tour our tasks andré 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.349
 nor quite two years ago that I 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:23.799
 prepare my album so I should have 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.750
 managed to get it out here I'm here 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.340
 always looking for a producer I 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.319
 some contacts so 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.330
 here we go to see how to follow her 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.370
 following has evolved and it is true that I 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.670
 a lot of dates this summer everywhere 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.310
 in France so it is that they were turning 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.280
 with my pieces and then some 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.420

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.099
 di of the voice 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.290
 that still attracts the crowds 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:50.440
 it is bearer yes it is sure that it is 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.920
 something that brings to come listen 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.180
 and then that's it booster it's a 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.040
 visibility that I would not have had in time 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.720
 normal so eventually I'm fine where 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.250
