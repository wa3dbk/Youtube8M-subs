about a feature that PlayStation 3 has

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.209

which<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.370> Xbox<00:00:08.760> does<00:00:09.059> not<00:00:09.300> have<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:10.130> a<00:00:11.130> lot

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
which the Xbox does not have and a lot

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.509 
which the Xbox does not have and a lot
of<00:00:11.429> people<00:00:11.670> realized<00:00:12.150> that<00:00:13.309> PlayStation<00:00:14.309> 3

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
of people realized that PlayStation 3

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.700 
of people realized that PlayStation 3
games<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:14.910> many<00:00:15.089> of<00:00:15.330> them<00:00:15.509> in<00:00:15.690> fact<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:16.289> would

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
games and many of them in fact I would

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.439 
games and many of them in fact I would
say<00:00:16.920> 75%<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.910> them<00:00:18.119> how<00:00:19.160> DTS<00:00:20.160> sound<00:00:20.789> as<00:00:21.150> an

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
say 75% of them how DTS sound as an

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.470 
say 75% of them how DTS sound as an
option<00:00:22.100> so<00:00:23.100> your<00:00:23.820> games<00:00:24.000> will<00:00:24.180> come<00:00:24.330> with

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
option so your games will come with

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.859 
option so your games will come with
Dolby<00:00:24.689> Digital<00:00:24.830> automatically<00:00:26.060> but<00:00:27.060> if<00:00:27.510> you

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
Dolby Digital automatically but if you

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.140 
Dolby Digital automatically but if you
do<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.080> certain<00:00:28.349> change<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.980> settings<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.730> DTS

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
do a certain change the settings the DTS

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.450 
do a certain change the settings the DTS
will<00:00:30.420> show<00:00:30.720> up<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.140> game<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.619> want<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.340> do

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
will show up in the game I want to do

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.799 
will show up in the game I want to do
this<00:00:32.579> because<00:00:32.820> many<00:00:33.149> people<00:00:33.239> don't<00:00:33.450> realize

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
this because many people don't realize

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.049 
this because many people don't realize
that<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.079> games<00:00:34.260> even<00:00:34.380> have<00:00:34.739> DTS<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.700> if

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
that the games even have DTS and if

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.130 
that the games even have DTS and if
you're<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.350> audiophile<00:00:37.820> in<00:00:38.820> my<00:00:39.000> opinion<00:00:39.450> DTS

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
you're a audiophile in my opinion DTS

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.530 
you're a audiophile in my opinion DTS
sounds<00:00:40.469> better<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:41.070> Dolby<00:00:41.309> Digital<00:00:41.450> so<00:00:42.450> I'm

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
sounds better in Dolby Digital so I'm

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.000 
sounds better in Dolby Digital so I'm
going<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.690> show<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.870> what<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.320> do<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.890> order

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
going to show you what you do in order

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.569 
going to show you what you do in order
to<00:00:44.190> make<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:44.879> work<00:00:45.500> on<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.590> games<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.520> you

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
to make this work on the games that you

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.209 
to make this work on the games that you
have<00:00:48.469> usually<00:00:49.469> if<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.680> look<00:00:49.710> at<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.010> back<00:00:50.190> of

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
have usually if you look at the back of

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.860 
have usually if you look at the back of
the<00:00:50.370> game<00:00:50.550> it'll<00:00:50.820> show<00:00:51.030> whether<00:00:51.300> or<00:00:51.449> not<00:00:51.570> has

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
the game it'll show whether or not has

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.520 
the game it'll show whether or not has
DTS<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:53.449> in<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:54.570> case<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.170> game<00:00:55.350> I'm<00:00:55.500> looking

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
DTS so in this case the game I'm looking

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.650 
DTS so in this case the game I'm looking
at<00:00:55.860> Metro<00:00:56.250> last<00:00:56.489> light<00:00:56.670> again<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.480> game

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
at Metro last light again and this game

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.860 
at Metro last light again and this game
does<00:00:57.899> have<00:00:57.930> DTS<00:00:58.699> but<00:00:59.699> if<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.180> load<00:01:00.600> up<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
does have DTS but if you load up the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.119 
does have DTS but if you load up the
game<00:01:01.020> it's<00:01:01.289> gonna<00:01:01.440> have<00:01:01.710> Dolby<00:01:02.100> Digital

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
game it's gonna have Dolby Digital

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.799 
game it's gonna have Dolby Digital
automatically<00:01:03.059> that's<00:01:03.120> what<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.420> false<00:01:03.660> to

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
automatically that's what to false to

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.170 
automatically that's what to false to
many<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.799> sony<00:01:05.070> published<00:01:05.519> games<00:01:05.790> like

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
many of the sony published games like

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.410 
many of the sony published games like
Uncharted<00:01:06.560> and<00:01:07.560> resistance<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.760> some<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.330> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
Uncharted and resistance and some of the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.580 
Uncharted and resistance and some of the
many<00:01:09.600> others<00:01:10.130> do<00:01:11.130> default<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.000> DTS<00:01:12.500> so<00:01:13.500> I'm

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
many others do default to the DTS so I'm

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.800 
many others do default to the DTS so I'm
not<00:01:13.710> sure<00:01:13.770> why<00:01:14.070> all<00:01:14.220> games<00:01:14.520> don't<00:01:14.850> but<00:01:15.150> and

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
not sure why all games don't but and

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.810 
not sure why all games don't but and
we're<00:01:15.960> we<00:01:16.049> gonna<00:01:16.140> do<00:01:16.259> at<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.470> point

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
we're we gonna do at this point

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.039 
we're we gonna do at this point
hopefully<00:01:17.820> with<00:01:18.119> next<00:01:18.360> generation<00:01:18.780> the

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
they do with Dolby I'm not sure why it

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.099 
they do with Dolby I'm not sure why it
just<00:03:46.590> seems<00:03:47.069> to<00:03:47.160> be<00:03:47.329> clearer<00:03:48.329> it<00:03:48.569> seems<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:48.989> be

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
just seems to be clearer it seems to be

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.840 
just seems to be clearer it seems to be
a<00:03:49.139> better<00:03:49.500> separation<00:03:49.980> between<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.459> channels

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
a better separation between the channels

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.879 
a better separation between the channels
there<00:03:51.510> seems<00:03:51.690> to<00:03:51.720> be<00:03:51.810> more<00:03:51.989> surround<00:03:52.500> sound

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
there seems to be more surround sound

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:54.949 
there seems to be more surround sound
than<00:03:53.370> Dolby<00:03:53.730> I'm<00:03:54.000> not<00:03:54.150> sure<00:03:54.299> it<00:03:54.450> is<00:03:54.510> but<00:03:54.750> just

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
than Dolby I'm not sure it is but just

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.629 
than Dolby I'm not sure it is but just
sounds<00:03:55.170> better<00:03:55.230> anyway<00:03:56.040> so<00:03:56.310> if<00:03:56.370> you<00:03:56.430> have<00:03:56.519> any

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
sounds better anyway so if you have any

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.220 
sounds better anyway so if you have any
