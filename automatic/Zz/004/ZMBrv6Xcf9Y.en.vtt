anything like that

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.669 
anything like that
drop<00:01:53.609> the<00:01:53.759> ten<00:01:53.939> grand<00:01:54.179> and<00:01:54.509> she'll<00:01:54.689> be<00:01:54.810> just<00:01:55.500> in

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
drop the ten grand and she'll be just in

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:57.800 
drop the ten grand and she'll be just in
good<00:01:55.829> shape<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.549> this<00:01:56.939> traction<00:01:57.539> control

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
good shape so this traction control

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.080 
good shape so this traction control
system<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.259> actually<00:01:58.530> really<00:01:58.920> intrusive<00:01:59.250> we

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
system is actually really intrusive we

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.609 
system is actually really intrusive we
tested<00:02:00.780> this<00:02:00.929> along<00:02:01.229> with<00:02:01.399> BMW<00:02:02.399> m5<00:02:02.819> a<00:02:03.689> very<00:02:04.469> big

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
tested this along with BMW m5 a very big

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.010 
tested this along with BMW m5 a very big
race<00:02:04.799> track<00:02:05.039> called<00:02:05.250> Mosport<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.789> all<00:02:06.750> the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
way up the back straight the traction

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.339 
way up the back straight the traction
control<00:02:08.670> light<00:02:08.940> on<00:02:09.330> this<00:02:09.509> car<00:02:09.690> was<00:02:09.929> blinking

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
control light on this car was blinking

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.680 
control light on this car was blinking
yeah<00:02:10.890> but<00:02:11.579> you<00:02:11.670> didn't<00:02:12.030> stuff<00:02:12.299> it<00:02:12.420> into<00:02:12.540> the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
yeah but you didn't stuff it into the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.940 
yeah but you didn't stuff it into the
barrier<00:02:13.019> so<00:02:13.079> it<00:02:13.230> was<00:02:13.379> doing<00:02:13.680> what<00:02:13.799> it<00:02:13.829> was

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
barrier so it was doing what it was

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.400 
barrier so it was doing what it was
supposed<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.430> do<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.690> really<00:02:16.110> like<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.379> idea

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
supposed to do I I really like the idea

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.759

performance<00:03:08.760> cred<00:03:09.319> now<00:03:10.319> you<00:03:10.380> guys<00:03:10.590> took<00:03:10.829> them

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
performance cred now you guys took them

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.949 
performance cred now you guys took them
around<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.250> track<00:03:11.519> how<00:03:11.910> would<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.239> rate<00:03:12.690> this

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
around the track how would you rate this

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.940 
around the track how would you rate this
car<00:03:13.230> against<00:03:13.889> the<00:03:14.040> m5

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
car against the m5

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.530 
car against the m5
the<00:03:15.790> m5<00:03:16.390> is<00:03:16.980> easier<00:03:17.980> for<00:03:18.209> novices<00:03:19.209> to<00:03:19.360> drive

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
the m5 is easier for novices to drive

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.240 
the m5 is easier for novices to drive
faster<00:03:19.990> around<00:03:20.319> the<00:03:20.410> track<00:03:20.620> and<00:03:20.920> it's<00:03:21.100> also

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
faster around the track and it's also

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.610 
faster around the track and it's also
easier<00:03:21.970> for<00:03:22.000> me<00:03:22.420> to<00:03:22.660> get<00:03:22.900> speed<00:03:23.290> out<00:03:23.440> of<00:03:23.530> the

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
easier for me to get speed out of the

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.970 
easier for me to get speed out of the
car

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
car

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.470 
car
so<00:03:24.340> it's<00:03:24.490> a<00:03:24.550> little<00:03:24.790> more<00:03:24.910> challenging<00:03:25.360> to

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
so it's a little more challenging to

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.080 
so it's a little more challenging to
drive<00:03:25.690> this<00:03:25.870> one<00:03:26.020> this<00:03:26.200> one<00:03:26.440> has<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:27.610> rear

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
drive this one this one has the rear

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.730 
drive this one this one has the rear
axle<00:03:28.480> is<00:03:28.569> a<00:03:28.630> little<00:03:28.870> more<00:03:28.990> lively<00:03:29.410> it<00:03:29.470> wants<00:03:29.650> to

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
axle is a little more lively it wants to

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.050 
axle is a little more lively it wants to
move<00:03:29.860> around<00:03:30.040> a<00:03:30.340> little<00:03:30.400> bit<00:03:30.550> more<00:03:30.700> whereas

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
move around a little bit more whereas

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.970 
move around a little bit more whereas
the<00:03:31.209> m5<00:03:31.630> is<00:03:31.870> a<00:03:31.900> little<00:03:32.200> bit<00:03:32.320> more<00:03:32.440> stable<00:03:32.860> now

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
the m5 is a little bit more stable now

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.770 
the m5 is a little bit more stable now
most<00:03:33.550> people<00:03:33.700> are<00:03:33.850> going<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:34.090> notice<00:03:34.360> that<00:03:34.510> I'm
