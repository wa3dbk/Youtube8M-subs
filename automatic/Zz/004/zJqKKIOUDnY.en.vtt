i'm<00:02:01.560> i'm<00:02:01.829> using<00:02:02.280> ipad<00:02:02.700> 2<00:02:02.909> right<00:02:03.119> now<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.270> it's

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
i'm i'm using ipad 2 right now and it's

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.670 
i'm i'm using ipad 2 right now and it's
buggy<00:02:04.219> yeah<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.280> picked<00:02:05.430> as<00:02:05.579> an<00:02:05.700> a5<00:02:06.030> processor

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
buggy yeah I picked as an a5 processor

buggy yeah I picked as an a5 processor
so<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:08.250> probably<00:02:08.459> think<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.819> wouldn't<00:02:09.030> be

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
so you probably think it wouldn't be

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.190 
so you probably think it wouldn't be
what<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.599> is

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200
