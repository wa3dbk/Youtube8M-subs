00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:12.500 
just so much more noise that people

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.890 
just so much more noise that people
don't<00:00:12.650> have<00:00:13.190> time<00:00:13.519> to<00:00:13.790> absorb<00:00:14.060> in<00:00:14.540> their<00:00:14.750> day

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900

and<00:00:15.080> really<00:00:15.470> they<00:00:15.620> sort<00:00:15.860> of<00:00:15.890> start<00:00:16.189> to<00:00:16.400> block

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
and really they sort of start to block

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.380 
and really they sort of start to block
out<00:00:17.420> and<00:00:18.140> I<00:00:18.650> think<00:00:18.859> what<00:00:19.579> I<00:00:19.609> wanted<00:00:19.999> to<00:00:20.179> start

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.060 
and so that's why I found myself and
Dubai<00:00:56.149> terminal<00:00:56.719> two<00:00:56.929> trying<00:00:57.649> to<00:00:57.739> figure<00:00:57.980> out

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
Dubai terminal two trying to figure out

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.680 
Dubai terminal two trying to figure out
how<00:00:58.219> to<00:00:58.280> put<00:00:58.489> on<00:00:58.519> a<00:00:58.640> headscarf<00:00:59.030> so<00:00:59.480> that<00:00:59.629> I

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
how to put on a headscarf so that I

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.360 
how to put on a headscarf so that I
looked<00:00:59.929> convincing<00:01:00.140> when<00:01:00.710> I<00:01:00.769> landed<00:01:01.309> in

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
looked convincing when I landed in

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.819 
looked convincing when I landed in
Afghanistan<00:01:02.149> and<00:01:02.179> I<00:01:02.690> was<00:01:02.899> just<00:01:03.079> as<00:01:03.199> green<00:01:03.499> as<00:01:03.530> a

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
Afghanistan and I was just as green as a

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.080
