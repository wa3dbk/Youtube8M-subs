00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.930
 Hello you and welcome 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.580
 to a new video of me I have 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.500
 I thought we knit together today 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.390
 this bowl and that needs it 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.250
 nothing but wool and our poor 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.509
 and that will be a lot of fun now 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:28.029
 to need the video, of course, would 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.470
 I 've had the readers here with us 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.750
 the strength is ten 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.199
 I can recommend a thinner role 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.100
 You can still take a thicker one 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.340
 and then you really only need it 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.930
 your little heart of leadership of the couple 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.570
 Unfortunately, it gets a bit annoying now 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.829
 you have to make the whole bunch and 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.739
 then the two end with one 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:50.290
 after that, always really knot that 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.700
 all wool ball back on the need 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.190
 you do not make but is recommended 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.110
 because otherwise simply the wool 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.239
 can knot and that is one 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.360
 bit annoying while you're at it 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.880
 knit is 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.010
 then it can start a longer 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.460
 piece left and then you make yourself one 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.300
 bend this loop you pull yourself 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.300
 then over the hand 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.110
 and then you take it like knitting 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.960
 mesh and I think you can 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.310
 see how I do it and yes 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.310
 you take ten of them 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.770
 I put the leftover piece 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.480
 in fact always in there to make it myself I 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.760
 You annoy me you can somehow 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.960
 do differently just like iris and want 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.810
 In any case , we were all arguing now 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.070
 mesh right and that's what you think 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:26.150
 The longer piece holds so in the hand 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.150
 because true the mesh about 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.500
 and always pull tight so that is 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:34.750
 really important for it to be neat 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.750
 looks like the first round 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.120
 in the next round we will knit 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.290
 upside down and left stitches 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.680
 and I think so, too 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.680
 recognize 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.849
 after the first two rounds sees this 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.439
 pretty much nothing 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:30.529
 but the sound is only promised 

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:32.150
 very pretty if you have yours 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:33.740
 length has then reached 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.659
 of course the stitches removed and that 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.860
 not the same as the normal stretch 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:43.930
 also and i will show you you stricks 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.930
 So first two stitches completely normal 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:57.289
 and now you want the first stitch and 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.610
 pull it over the second over it 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:03.080
 Do you already have the first mosque? 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:06.289
 Imagine again tricking a trick 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:10.819
 normal and pull the again 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:14.050
 Back over the claim you do 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:14.050
 also until the end 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:35.970
 and now and the thread completely failed 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:40.170
 now a scarf is almost ready and 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:43.340
 Now we are going, so to speak, the two 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.340
 end together 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:55.120
 and you take that easy now 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:57.150
 leftover piece and before with is 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:01.000
 just like that 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:03.390
 between the two together so actually 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.890
 like a normal knit 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:08.850
 sew together too and that simple 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.850
 by 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.600
 you do that until the end and on 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.660
 end you can still a knot purely 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.610
 make and talk about the leftover 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.840
 can you then cut off and that is 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.840
 the sound also finished
