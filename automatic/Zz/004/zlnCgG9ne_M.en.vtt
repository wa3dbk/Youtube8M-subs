 to be perfected must be measured in the timer is no longer the only one 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:07.410
 essential swimming tool technology has arrived by the pool 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.410
 that I could and detailed from the moment of the start 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:13.330
 until the strokes and the turn 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.880
 an effort to save hundreds of seconds enough to 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.519
 victory in the sport 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.789
 eliel analyst of a selection mechanic filming submerged 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.369
 win on the computer 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.000
 in a fun way from the statisticians from them 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.070
 it is possible to analyze the speed of the square of the right the speed of the square 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.730
 then left donation at the turn how long does the athlete take to start 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.650
 swimming after falling in the pool extended from a zone of supply 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.700
 details that are not visible to the naked eye 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.700
 and everyone sees on the podium the most likely 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.600
 I have never accepted a series of differentials in relation to the 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.720
 our side while the other players a turn for example in the last 50 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.910
 meters the world approximately the local trade after the turn 5 meters 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.910
 michael phelps nothing after ten grandchildren 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.750
 at the time the coach 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.060
 efficient climbs also 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.060
 could also save a lot of energy 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.140
 these factors will make it never advantage over other others 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.970
 do not give biomechanical analysis 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.110
 helped develop a Brazilian revelation 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.120
 you were born in the same year to the athlete 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.290
 ef 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.730
 we realize through gps had some oscillations passes the arm 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.740
 right arm left 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.740
 can not find out how to breath 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.630
 It was late, this fish is a blessing for this aspect. 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.770
 The Coach 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.490
 one more athlete has been working together with staff since 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.819
 but attention to those dates 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:58.710
 to some extent sing with him 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.800
 napoli has an evolution shown cell 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.820
 ef 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.830
 in 2003 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.830
 he had scars that imposed on us 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.379
 within the water with an average stroke 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:13.089
 in 2006 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:16.249
 at the time there was a variation of 10 half 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:17.479
 aa 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:19.499
 33 min 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:22.809
 nanda speaks for a very significant evolution 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:27.279
 in sports marked in brazil by the likes of ricardo pra do gustavo porto 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:32.159
 fernando scherer and tiago perreira women have been gaining space evolved 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:33.719
 long delayed 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:36.879
 in the last Olympiad they managed to do three Olympic finals 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.729
 I will not discuss 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:40.890
 the result of a feminine characteristic 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.749
 attention to the details 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:45.689
 one of the curiosities and details are like this 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:47.769
 the high point of the test who 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.769
 really devote 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.739
 it's the afternoon 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.729
 it's detail 

00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:00.729
 it's too programmed you can not think 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.519
 of the region's 70 channel cities 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.319
