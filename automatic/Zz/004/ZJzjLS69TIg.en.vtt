all<00:00:02.340> right<00:00:02.550> so<00:00:02.730> the<00:00:03.090> body<00:00:03.780> is<00:00:04.110> just<00:00:04.440> a<00:00:04.530> bag<00:00:04.770> of

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:04.800 
all right so the body is just a bag of

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.070 
all right so the body is just a bag of
energy<00:00:05.280> basically<00:00:05.640> that<00:00:06.300> can<00:00:06.480> be<00:00:06.600> manipulated

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
energy basically that can be manipulated

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.579 
energy basically that can be manipulated
by<00:00:07.350> will<00:00:07.680> and<00:00:08.299> there's<00:00:09.299> dualistic<00:00:09.780> nature<00:00:10.019> or

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:10.589 
by will and there's dualistic nature or

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.859 
by will and there's dualistic nature or
reality<00:00:11.580> that<00:00:11.759> we<00:00:11.910> submitted<00:00:12.570> ourselves<00:00:13.139> to

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:14.869 
reality that we submitted ourselves to

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:16.940 
reality that we submitted ourselves to
you<00:00:15.869> gotta<00:00:16.050> understand<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:16.560> then<00:00:16.710> you

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:16.950 
you gotta understand that then you

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.270 
you gotta understand that then you
reincarnate<00:00:17.640> every<00:00:18.360> morning<00:00:18.950> your<00:00:19.950> will

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:20.280 
reincarnate every morning your will

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.370 
reincarnate every morning your will
takes<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.000> form<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.570> human<00:00:21.840> body<00:00:22.050> every

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
takes the form of a human body every

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.320 
takes the form of a human body every
morning<00:00:23.040> so<00:00:25.280> with<00:00:26.280> that<00:00:26.460> said<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:27.150> can

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
morning so with that said you can

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.180 
morning so with that said you can
reincarnate<00:00:27.570> at<00:00:28.050> will<00:00:28.290> at<00:00:28.440> any<00:00:28.560> time<00:00:28.920> if<00:00:29.100> you

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:29.190 
reincarnate at will at any time if you

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.550 
reincarnate at will at any time if you
were<00:00:29.280> to<00:00:29.400> go<00:00:29.490> into<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.760> trance<00:00:30.060> state<00:00:30.420> or<00:00:31.020> dream

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
were to go into a trance state or dream

were to go into a trance state or dream
what<00:00:31.770> have<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.279> can<00:00:32.940> reincarnate<00:00:33.600> into

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
what have you you can reincarnate into

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.389 
what have you you can reincarnate into
different<00:00:35.399> various<00:00:35.999> bodies<00:00:36.390> along<00:00:36.719> this

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
different various bodies along this

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.680 
different various bodies along this
infinity<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.550> we<00:00:38.670> call<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.999> universe<00:00:39.420> what

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
infinity that we call the universe what

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.619 
infinity that we call the universe what
have<00:00:39.839> you<00:00:40.309> just<00:00:41.309> space<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:41.850> general<00:00:42.050> so<00:00:43.050> you

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
have you just space in general so you

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.059 
have you just space in general so you

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
instead of it's all again you know

instead of it's all again you know
instead<00:02:49.690> of<00:02:49.750> listening<00:02:50.140> to<00:02:50.170> your<00:02:50.380> instincts

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
instead of listening to your instincts

and being a loyal person you know you

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.690 
and being a loyal person you know you
have<00:02:53.349> a<00:02:53.380> dog<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:53.860> know<00:02:54.010> all<00:02:54.250> those<00:02:54.400> things

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
have a dog you know all those things

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.150 
have a dog you know all those things
happen<00:02:55.120> so<00:02:55.360> that<00:02:55.959> it's<00:02:56.260> just<00:02:56.440> it's<00:02:57.099> just

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
happen so that it's just it's just

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.819 
happen so that it's just it's just
compensation<00:02:58.150> again<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.140> it<00:02:59.230> creates<00:02:59.620> this

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
compensation again and it creates this

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.930 
compensation again and it creates this
mess<00:03:00.130> that<00:03:00.400> we<00:03:00.489> have<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:00.940> know<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:02.880> this<00:03:03.880> is

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
mess that we have you know and this is

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.430 
mess that we have you know and this is
where<00:03:04.209> we're<00:03:04.360> at<00:03:04.420> right<00:03:04.480> now<00:03:04.840> it's<00:03:05.230> just<00:03:05.290> about

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
where we're at right now it's just about

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.199 
where we're at right now it's just about
remedying<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.190> situation<00:03:06.790> so<00:03:06.940> you<00:03:07.060> gotta

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
remedying the situation so you gotta

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.210 
remedying the situation so you gotta
understand<00:03:07.660> that<00:03:07.870> that<00:03:07.989> the<00:03:08.110> dog<00:03:08.319> is<00:03:08.349> not

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
understand that that the dog is not

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.400 
understand that that the dog is not
really<00:03:09.549> there<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:10.030> dog<00:03:10.720> which<00:03:10.870> is<00:03:10.989> a<00:03:11.019> piece<00:03:11.230> of

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
really there the dog which is a piece of

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.059 
really there the dog which is a piece of
you<00:03:11.560> so<00:03:13.139> it's<00:03:14.139> not<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.410> say<00:03:14.560> that<00:03:14.709> it's<00:03:14.829> to<00:03:14.950> be

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
you so it's not to say that it's to be

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.920 
you so it's not to say that it's to be
discarded<00:03:15.700> or<00:03:15.760> mistreated<00:03:16.269> or<00:03:16.420> anything<00:03:16.630> like

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
discarded or mistreated or anything like

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:17.220 
discarded or mistreated or anything like
that

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
that

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.629 
that
this<00:03:17.500> would<00:03:17.680> be<00:03:17.829> that<00:03:18.100> means<00:03:18.280> is<00:03:18.400> to<00:03:18.519> be

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
this would be that means is to be

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.400 
this would be that means is to be
respected<00:03:19.269> if<00:03:19.389> you've<00:03:19.569> seen<00:03:19.840> no<00:03:19.930> separation

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
respected if you've seen no separation

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.250 
respected if you've seen no separation
from<00:03:20.739> the<00:03:20.889> dog<00:03:21.100> in<00:03:21.310> yourself<00:03:21.700> so<00:03:21.940> that<00:03:22.900> is<00:03:23.049> not

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
from the dog in yourself so that is not

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.680 
from the dog in yourself so that is not
to<00:03:23.590> put<00:03:23.889> animals<00:03:24.700> down<00:03:25.060> at<00:03:25.269> all<00:03:25.359> because

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
to put animals down at all because

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.629 
to put animals down at all because
animal<00:03:26.109> just<00:03:26.230> means<00:03:26.470> animated<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.310> anything

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
animal just means animated and anything

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:32.879 
animal just means animated and anything
animated<00:03:28.150> is<00:03:28.410> technically<00:03:29.410> animal<00:03:30.299> so<00:03:31.889> that's

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
animated is technically animal so that's

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.610 
animated is technically animal so that's
really<00:03:33.100> about<00:03:33.370> it<00:03:33.430> man<00:03:33.790> dogs<00:03:34.350> they<00:03:35.350> can<00:03:35.380> be

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
really about it man dogs they can be

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.500 
really about it man dogs they can be
good<00:03:35.769> parasites<00:03:36.400> they<00:03:36.549> can<00:03:36.670> be<00:03:36.790> bad<00:03:36.970> parasites

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
good parasites they can be bad parasites

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.339 
good parasites they can be bad parasites
but<00:03:37.750> they<00:03:37.930> are<00:03:38.049> indeed<00:03:38.349> parasites<00:03:38.920> they<00:03:39.700> are<00:03:39.910> a

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
but they are indeed parasites they are a

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.440 
but they are indeed parasites they are a
window<00:03:41.349> you<00:03:42.069> know<00:03:42.160> that<00:03:42.430> again<00:03:42.819> it'd<00:03:43.030> be<00:03:43.209> good

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
window you know that again it'd be good

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.660 
window you know that again it'd be good
to<00:03:43.510> have<00:03:43.630> them<00:03:43.870> in<00:03:44.250> multiples<00:03:45.250> not<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.549> have

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
to have them in multiples not to have

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.449 
to have them in multiples not to have
just<00:03:45.880> one<00:03:46.060> dog<00:03:46.530> because<00:03:47.530> they<00:03:47.709> tend<00:03:48.220> to<00:03:48.280> lose

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
just one dog because they tend to lose

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.039 
just one dog because they tend to lose
themselves<00:03:48.760> don't<00:03:49.180> like<00:03:49.329> their<00:03:49.510> cat<00:03:49.780> which<00:03:50.019> is

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
themselves don't like their cat which is

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:51.449 
themselves don't like their cat which is
a<00:03:50.200> little<00:03:50.470> more<00:03:50.590> ancient<00:03:50.799> and<00:03:51.069> a<00:03:51.160> little<00:03:51.340> less

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
a little more ancient and a little less

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.520 
a little more ancient and a little less
broken<00:03:51.700> so<00:03:52.209> again<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.599> cat<00:03:52.840> genetics<00:03:53.349> are<00:03:53.500> a

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
broken so again the cat genetics are a

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.309 
broken so again the cat genetics are a
little<00:03:53.680> more<00:03:53.980> together<00:03:54.130> now<00:03:54.609> then<00:03:55.389> that's<00:03:56.109> why

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
little more together now then that's why

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.129 
little more together now then that's why
it's<00:03:56.530> not<00:03:56.889> as<00:03:57.069> dependent<00:03:57.669> the<00:03:58.209> more<00:03:58.450> dependent

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
it's not as dependent the more dependent

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:01.289 
it's not as dependent the more dependent
you<00:03:59.169> are<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.560> less<00:03:59.709> complete<00:04:00.099> you<00:04:00.250> are<00:04:00.280> and<00:04:00.700> so

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
you are the less complete you are and so

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:02.699

00:04:32.429 --> 00:04:32.439 
know you just represent relative

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:35.760 
know you just represent relative
evolution<00:04:33.039> to<00:04:33.939> that<00:04:34.270> being<00:04:34.539> to<00:04:35.050> that<00:04:35.289> window

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
evolution to that being to that window

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.219 
evolution to that being to that window
you<00:04:36.580> know<00:04:36.699> because<00:04:36.999> it's<00:04:37.150> just<00:04:37.360> energy<00:04:37.659> really

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
you know because it's just energy really

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:42.510 
you know because it's just energy really
it's<00:04:38.590> just<00:04:38.680> an<00:04:38.889> expression<00:04:39.159> itself<00:04:39.749> so<00:04:41.520> with

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
it's just an expression itself so with

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.879 
it's just an expression itself so with
that<00:04:42.669> said<00:04:42.969> you<00:04:43.029> know<00:04:43.319> you<00:04:44.319> can<00:04:44.439> take<00:04:44.620> this<00:04:44.740> how

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
that said you know you can take this how

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:45.920 
that said you know you can take this how
you<00:04:44.949> want<00:04:45.279> it<00:04:45.370> on

you want it on
we<00:04:46.930> shouldn't<00:04:47.439> be<00:04:47.969> in<00:04:48.969> control<00:04:49.360> of<00:04:49.479> other

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:53.949 
things the way we are of course this

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:55.709 
things the way we are of course this
really<00:04:54.310> is<00:04:54.400> a<00:04:54.460> lot<00:04:54.490> to<00:04:54.610> do<00:04:54.819> again<00:04:55.090> duty<00:04:55.479> comes

00:04:55.709 --> 00:04:55.719 
really is a lot to do again duty comes

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:57.540
