don't know if you guys know this but

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.759 
don't know if you guys know this but
it's<00:00:11.099> been<00:00:11.460> about<00:00:12.210> two<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.320> half<00:00:13.349> years

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
it's been about two and a half years

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.709 
it's been about two and a half years
since<00:00:14.070> we<00:00:14.250> started<00:00:14.490> doing<00:00:14.849> YouTube<00:00:15.179> and

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
since we started doing YouTube and

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:16.910 
since we started doing YouTube and
that's<00:00:15.900> weird<00:00:16.139> right<00:00:16.230> because<00:00:16.560> you<00:00:16.680> think

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
that's weird right because you think

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.529 
that's weird right because you think
like<00:00:17.100> wow<00:00:17.279> these<00:00:17.670> guys<00:00:17.730> have<00:00:18.060> been<00:00:18.090> doing<00:00:18.300> this

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
like wow these guys have been doing this

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.730 
like wow these guys have been doing this
for<00:00:18.690> two<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.020> half<00:00:19.050> years<00:00:19.410> you'd<00:00:19.710> think

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
for two and a half years you'd think

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.560 
for two and a half years you'd think
they'd<00:00:20.070> be<00:00:20.100> better<00:00:20.400> by<00:00:20.580> now<00:00:20.760> but<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.210> got<00:00:21.390> me

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
they'd be better by now but that got me

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.900 
they'd be better by now but that got me
thinking<00:00:21.810> we<00:00:22.500> haven't<00:00:22.859> gotten<00:00:23.070> better<00:00:23.279> like

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
thinking we haven't gotten better like

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.439 
thinking we haven't gotten better like
we<00:00:24.840> really<00:00:25.439> haven't<00:00:26.010> gotten<00:00:26.220> better<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:27.300> that

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
we really haven't gotten better so that

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.660 
we really haven't gotten better so that
I<00:00:27.480> start<00:00:27.810> thinking<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.289> like<00:00:28.500> how<00:00:29.070> we<00:00:29.099> haven't

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
like on top we wouldn't be let think

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.840 
like on top we wouldn't be let think
about<00:03:11.380> it<00:03:11.560> think<00:03:11.709> about<00:03:11.799> the<00:03:12.040> most<00:03:12.220> successful

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
now that's not like a game to probably

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.890 
now that's not like a game to probably
