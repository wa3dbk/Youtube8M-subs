Photoshop<00:00:55.800> or<00:00:56.100> microsoft<00:00:56.670> word<00:00:56.879> or<00:00:57.149> pretty

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
Photoshop or microsoft word or pretty

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.180 
Photoshop or microsoft word or pretty
much<00:00:57.420> any<00:00:57.750> program<00:00:58.199> where<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.500> can<00:00:58.680> type<00:00:58.949> out

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
much any program where you can type out

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.479 
much any program where you can type out
text<00:01:00.079> and<00:01:01.079> then<00:01:01.260> it's<00:01:01.739> very<00:01:02.010> important<00:01:02.430> that

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
text and then it's very important that

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.609 
text and then it's very important that
you<00:01:02.670> flip<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.149> because<00:01:03.629> when<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.080> iron<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.470> on

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
you flip it because when you iron it on

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.460 
you flip it because when you iron it on
it<00:01:05.040> will<00:01:05.220> reverse<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.030> image<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.170> needs<00:01:07.350> to

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
it will reverse the image so it needs to

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.399 
it will reverse the image so it needs to
look<00:01:07.680> backwards<00:01:08.659> to<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.979> to<00:01:10.979> start<00:01:11.220> yep<00:01:12.409> next

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
look backwards to you to start yep next

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.350 
look backwards to you to start yep next
you<00:01:13.530> need<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.710> print<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.189> out<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.670> it's<00:01:15.210> always

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
you need to print it out and it's always

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.240 
you need to print it out and it's always
good<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.630> do<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.780> test<00:01:16.080> print<00:01:16.350> just<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.979> see<00:01:17.130> if

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
good to do a test print just to see if

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.429 
good to do a test print just to see if
you<00:01:17.369> like<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.729> sizing<00:01:18.299> before<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.960> waste<00:01:19.229> any

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
you like the sizing before you waste any

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.810 
you like the sizing before you waste any
of<00:01:19.680> your<00:01:19.860> awesome<00:01:20.400> transfer<00:01:21.210> paper<00:01:22.820> agreed

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
of your awesome transfer paper agreed

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.109 
of your awesome transfer paper agreed
quote<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.810> then<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.979> next<00:01:26.250> step<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.850> trim

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
quote and then the next step is to trim

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.130 
quote and then the next step is to trim
so<00:01:28.130> you<00:01:29.130> will<00:01:29.340> just<00:01:29.549> want<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.150> trim<00:01:30.600> with<00:01:30.869> kind

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
so you will just want to trim with kind

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.010 
so you will just want to trim with kind
of<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.350> rounded<00:01:31.860> edge<00:01:32.270> that<00:01:33.270> helps<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.840> to

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
of a rounded edge that helps it to

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.190 
of a rounded edge that helps it to
really<00:01:34.439> adhere<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:36.000> t-shirt<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.720> not<00:01:36.990> to

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
really adhere to the t-shirt and not to

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.969 
really adhere to the t-shirt and not to
peel<00:01:37.530> off<00:01:37.799> when<00:01:38.070> you're<00:01:38.189> wearing<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:39.829> so<00:01:40.829> just

peel off when you're wearing it so just

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.910 
peel off when you're wearing it so just
go<00:01:41.100> around<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.670> design<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.619> keep<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.740> as

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920
