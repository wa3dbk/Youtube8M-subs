but if we render this project real quick
as<00:02:00.789> a<00:02:00.820> highest<00:02:01.720> quality<00:02:02.170> mp3<00:02:02.380> I'll<00:02:03.039> take<00:02:03.220> like

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
as a highest quality mp3 I'll take like

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.429 
as a highest quality mp3 I'll take like
two<00:02:03.549> seconds<00:02:03.940> to<00:02:04.060> render<00:02:04.210> perfect<00:02:04.570> go<00:02:05.229> across

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
two seconds to render perfect go across

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.679 
two seconds to render perfect go across
to<00:02:05.619> audacity<00:02:06.310> now<00:02:06.340> and<00:02:06.759> we<00:02:07.060> want<00:02:07.240> to<00:02:07.299> open<00:02:07.330> up

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:05.229 
gameplay so it could just be connected

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:07.380 
gameplay so it could just be connected
to<00:06:05.350> that<00:06:05.530> but<00:06:06.220> having<00:06:06.580> the<00:06:06.669> phone<00:06:06.850> guys<00:06:07.090> voice
