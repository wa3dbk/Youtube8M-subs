it personally I understand that some
people<00:02:41.340> don't<00:02:41.670> see<00:02:42.000> that's<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.659> big<00:02:42.870> deal

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
people don't see that's a big deal

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.660 
people don't see that's a big deal
because<00:02:43.319> they're<00:02:43.859> online<00:02:44.040> all<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:44.549> time

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
because they're online all the time

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.349 
because they're online all the time
that's<00:02:45.120> fine<00:02:46.489> but<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.609> points<00:02:47.939> that<00:02:48.030> I<00:02:48.120> made

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
that's fine but the points that I made

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.629 
that's fine but the points that I made
you<00:02:48.780> really<00:02:49.560> can't<00:02:49.799> argue<00:02:50.040> them<00:02:50.370> because

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
you really can't argue them because

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:52.399 
you really can't argue them because
they've<00:02:50.819> already<00:02:51.090> happened<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.989> mean<00:02:52.230> these

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
they've already happened I mean these

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:56.059 
they've already happened I mean these
are<00:02:52.620> facts<00:02:52.919> and<00:02:53.510> I<00:02:54.510> mean<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.290> only<00:02:55.620> thing<00:02:55.889> that

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
are facts and I mean the only thing that

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.899 
are facts and I mean the only thing that
I<00:02:56.310> can<00:02:56.519> see<00:02:56.760> as<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.409> workaround<00:02:58.409> for<00:02:58.799> this<00:02:59.099> is<00:02:59.370> if

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
I can see as a workaround for this is if

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:01.879 
I can see as a workaround for this is if
eventually<00:03:00.689> down<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.870> road<00:03:01.019> that<00:03:01.530> you<00:03:01.650> hack

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
eventually down the road that you hack

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.550 
eventually down the road that you hack
the<00:03:01.919> console<00:03:02.549> in<00:03:02.780> turn<00:03:03.780> you<00:03:04.019> wouldn't<00:03:04.319> be<00:03:04.409> able

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
the console in turn you wouldn't be able

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.140 
the console in turn you wouldn't be able
to<00:03:04.620> go<00:03:04.739> online<00:03:04.919> with<00:03:05.189> it<00:03:05.639> anyway<00:03:07.609> so<00:03:08.609> you're

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
to go online with it anyway so you're

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.789 
to go online with it anyway so you're
fucked<00:03:09.540> or<00:03:09.750> you're<00:03:10.500> fucked<00:03:11.090> pick<00:03:12.090> a<00:03:12.120> hole<00:03:12.419> and

fucked or you're fucked pick a hole and
just<00:03:13.799> hope<00:03:14.010> for<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.250> best<00:03:14.480> because<00:03:15.480> your<00:03:15.719> game

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
just hope for the best because your game

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:16.369 
just hope for the best because your game
fucked

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
about that quite a while ago for the

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.479 
about that quite a while ago for the

next Xbox up wasn't going to play use
games<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:36.030> I<00:03:36.090> thought<00:03:36.269> that<00:03:36.449> was<00:03:36.540> an

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
games and I thought that was an

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.740 
games and I thought that was an
extremely<00:03:37.229> bad<00:03:37.439> idea<00:03:37.500> to<00:03:38.370> go<00:03:38.489> and<00:03:38.669> well<00:03:39.150> let's

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
extremely bad idea to go and well let's

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.949 
extremely bad idea to go and well let's
say<00:03:39.930> that<00:03:39.959> I<00:03:40.500> pick<00:03:40.829> up

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
say that I pick up

the code within it is tied to my account

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.999 
the code within it is tied to my account
into<00:03:49.500> that<00:03:49.680> particular<00:03:49.979> console<00:03:50.579> okay<00:03:52.009> that

into that particular console okay that

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:54.949 
into that particular console okay that
doesn't<00:03:53.220> seem<00:03:53.489> so<00:03:53.729> bad<00:03:53.759> at<00:03:54.090> first<00:03:54.239> right<00:03:54.599> well

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
doesn't seem so bad at first right well

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.469 
doesn't seem so bad at first right well
what<00:03:55.199> happens<00:03:55.530> when<00:03:55.859> you<00:03:56.430> can<00:03:56.639> only<00:03:56.790> login<00:03:57.329> on

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:57.479 
what happens when you can only login on

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:01.219 
what happens when you can only login on
so<00:03:58.049> many<00:03:58.470> consoles<00:03:59.389> because<00:04:00.389> we've<00:04:01.019> already

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:01.229 
so many consoles because we've already

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:03.979 
so many consoles because we've already
seen<00:04:01.560> that<00:04:01.769> they<00:04:01.949> do<00:04:02.009> have<00:04:02.370> a<00:04:02.430> limit<00:04:02.879> there<00:04:03.629> is

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
seen that they do have a limit there is

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.719 
seen that they do have a limit there is
a<00:04:04.199> glass<00:04:04.470> ceiling<00:04:04.949> and<00:04:05.040> you<00:04:05.250> can't<00:04:05.489> break

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:05.729 
a glass ceiling and you can't break

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:08.689 
a glass ceiling and you can't break
through<00:04:05.939> it<00:04:06.319> so<00:04:07.319> you<00:04:07.680> can't<00:04:08.069> lend<00:04:08.400> out<00:04:08.549> your

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:08.699 
through it so you can't lend out your

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:10.909 
through it so you can't lend out your
game<00:04:08.819> you<00:04:09.000> can't<00:04:09.209> let<00:04:09.989> somebody<00:04:10.229> borrow<00:04:10.620> it

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
game you can't let somebody borrow it

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.099 
game you can't let somebody borrow it
you<00:04:11.849> can't<00:04:12.060> borrow<00:04:12.269> somebody<00:04:12.629> else's<00:04:12.689> game

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
you can't borrow somebody else's game

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:17.060 
you can't borrow somebody else's game
you<00:04:13.290> won't<00:04:13.470> be<00:04:13.560> over<00:04:13.739> brunch<00:04:13.949> games<00:04:14.569> and<00:04:16.070> then

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
you won't be over brunch games and then

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.879 
you won't be over brunch games and then
this<00:04:17.519> makes<00:04:17.909> sure<00:04:18.259> that<00:04:19.259> they<00:04:19.560> have<00:04:19.859> a

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
this makes sure that they have a

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.180 
this makes sure that they have a
stranglehold<00:04:20.310> over<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.719> entire<00:04:22.079> market<00:04:22.590> so

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
stranglehold over the entire market so

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.040 
stranglehold over the entire market so
somebody<00:04:23.849> wouldn't<00:04:24.120> be<00:04:24.240> able<00:04:24.360> to<00:04:24.510> just<00:04:24.870> open

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
somebody wouldn't be able to just open

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.530 
somebody wouldn't be able to just open

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
games tons of times I'm sure because

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.570 
games tons of times I'm sure because
they<00:04:36.380> were<00:04:36.440> no<00:04:36.620> longer<00:04:36.980> available<00:04:37.190> or<00:04:37.550> just

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
they were no longer available or just

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.890 
they were no longer available or just
because<00:04:38.030> they<00:04:38.150> were<00:04:38.210> a<00:04:38.300> ton<00:04:38.510> cheaper<00:04:38.750> or

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
because they were a ton cheaper or

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.240 
because they were a ton cheaper or
because<00:04:39.200> they<00:04:39.320> had<00:04:39.440> some<00:04:39.620> kind<00:04:39.860> of<00:04:39.920> deal

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
because they had some kind of deal

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.680 
because they had some kind of deal
there's<00:04:40.490> tons<00:04:40.670> of<00:04:40.820> reasons<00:04:41.150> why<00:04:41.300> you<00:04:41.360> would<00:04:41.540> go

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
there's tons of reasons why you would go

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.050 
there's tons of reasons why you would go
and<00:04:41.840> buy<00:04:42.020> a<00:04:42.050> used<00:04:42.560> game<00:04:42.830> I<00:04:43.160> mean<00:04:43.550> usually<00:04:43.760> the

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
and buy a used game I mean usually the

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.820 
and buy a used game I mean usually the
main<00:04:44.210> reason<00:04:44.510> for<00:04:44.540> me<00:04:44.810> is<00:04:45.050> because<00:04:45.290> it's<00:04:45.650> not

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
main reason for me is because it's not

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.140 
main reason for me is because it's not
available<00:04:46.280> and<00:04:46.430> it's<00:04:46.700> cheap

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
available and it's cheap

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.120 
available and it's cheap
that's<00:04:47.630> main<00:04:47.840> reason<00:04:48.110> why<00:04:48.230> I<00:04:48.260> use<00:04:48.590> games

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
that's main reason why I use games

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.510 
that's main reason why I use games
that's<00:04:49.460> main<00:04:49.640> reason<00:04:49.910> why<00:04:50.000> everybody<00:04:50.360> does

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
that's main reason why everybody does

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.040 
that's main reason why everybody does
but<00:04:52.520> in<00:04:52.670> and<00:04:52.880> think<00:04:53.150> about<00:04:53.360> that<00:04:53.510> what<00:04:53.750> happens

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
but in and think about that what happens

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.750 
but in and think about that what happens
when<00:04:54.200> I<00:04:54.230> was<00:04:54.380> a<00:04:54.440> very<00:04:54.650> very<00:04:54.860> low<00:04:55.100> print<00:04:55.400> run<00:04:55.550> and

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
when I was a very very low print run and

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.550 
when I was a very very low print run and
they<00:04:56.090> don't<00:04:56.300> make<00:04:56.480> it<00:04:56.600> available<00:04:56.780> digitally

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
they don't make it available digitally

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.940 
they don't make it available digitally
and<00:04:57.850> let's<00:04:58.850> be<00:04:59.030> fucking<00:04:59.360> fair<00:04:59.750> here<00:05:00.020> that<00:05:00.620> that

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
and let's be fucking fair here that that

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.890 
and let's be fucking fair here that that
is<00:05:01.130> a<00:05:01.160> fucking<00:05:01.520> fact<00:05:01.910> not<00:05:02.360> everything<00:05:02.810> is

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
is a fucking fact not everything is

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.070 
is a fucking fact not everything is
going<00:05:03.020> to<00:05:03.110> be<00:05:03.170> made<00:05:03.350> available<00:05:03.380> digitally<00:05:04.220> and

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
going to be made available digitally and

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.330 
going to be made available digitally and
even<00:05:06.080> if<00:05:06.170> it<00:05:06.320> is<00:05:06.470> you<00:05:06.800> know<00:05:06.830> that<00:05:07.100> they<00:05:07.220> have<00:05:07.310> a

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
even if it is you know that they have a

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.530 
even if it is you know that they have a
certain<00:05:07.580> amount<00:05:07.700> of<00:05:07.880> time<00:05:08.030> that<00:05:08.060> they<00:05:08.330> make

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
certain amount of time that they make

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.140 
certain amount of time that they make
those<00:05:08.690> available<00:05:09.130> so<00:05:10.130> it<00:05:10.670> coupled<00:05:11.030> up<00:05:11.090> with

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
those available so it coupled up with

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.760 
those available so it coupled up with
the<00:05:11.300> fact<00:05:11.510> that<00:05:11.600> the<00:05:11.870> physical<00:05:12.290> copies<00:05:12.620> going

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
the fact that the physical copies going

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.440 
the fact that the physical copies going
to<00:05:12.830> have<00:05:12.920> a<00:05:12.950> low<00:05:13.160> print<00:05:13.460> run<00:05:13.610> so<00:05:14.060> that<00:05:14.270> low

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
to have a low print run so that low

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.630 
to have a low print run so that low
print<00:05:14.750> run<00:05:14.900> is<00:05:15.050> then<00:05:15.410> in<00:05:15.650> turn<00:05:15.920> going<00:05:16.370> to<00:05:16.430> mean

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
print run is then in turn going to mean

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.190 
print run is then in turn going to mean
that<00:05:16.910> all<00:05:17.150> the<00:05:17.390> people<00:05:17.420> that<00:05:17.750> bought<00:05:17.870> it<00:05:18.020> first

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
that all the people that bought it first

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.630 
that all the people that bought it first
or<00:05:18.500> dolly<00:05:18.650> people<00:05:19.010> that<00:05:19.130> have<00:05:19.280> it<00:05:19.400> and<00:05:19.550> then

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
or dolly people that have it and then

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.110 
or dolly people that have it and then
that's<00:05:19.760> it<00:05:20.020> then<00:05:21.020> poof<00:05:21.410> gone<00:05:21.830> and<00:05:22.730> think<00:05:22.910> about

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
that's it then poof gone and think about

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.060 
that's it then poof gone and think about
all<00:05:23.300> those<00:05:23.510> like<00:05:23.780> underground<00:05:24.350> games<00:05:24.620> that
