strategy so things with it's not going

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.360 
strategy so things with it's not going
to<00:00:51.120> work<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.989> get<00:00:52.140> threads<00:00:52.440> like<00:00:52.590> these<00:00:52.829> this

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
to work you get threads like these this

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.760 
to work you get threads like these this
one<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.760> Griffin<00:00:54.120> 40<00:00:54.539> I've<00:00:54.930> been<00:00:55.320> using<00:00:55.500> it

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
one is the Griffin 40 I've been using it

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.990 
one is the Griffin 40 I've been using it
I<00:00:55.829> think<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.280> like<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.489> first<00:00:56.730> thread

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
I think this is like the first thread

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.400 
I think this is like the first thread
that<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.180> got<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.660> it's<00:00:57.750> sex<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.140> much<00:00:58.260> of

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
that I got and it's sex so much of

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.810 
that I got and it's sex so much of
thread<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.370> can<00:00:59.520> use<00:00:59.670> it

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
thread in this so that you can use it

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.209 
thread in this so that you can use it
over<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.180> over<00:01:00.390> again<00:01:00.480> break<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.559> at<00:01:01.739> a

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
over and over again break it at a

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.709 
over and over again break it at a
particular<00:01:02.730> point<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.420> you're<00:01:03.539> going<00:01:03.690> to

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
particular point and you're going to

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.410 
particular point and you're going to
take<00:01:03.870> both<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.739> ends<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.909> thread<00:01:06.210> and

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
take both of the ends of the thread and

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.710 
take both of the ends of the thread and
tie<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.930> together<00:01:07.220> after<00:01:08.420> that<00:01:09.420> you're<00:01:09.570> going

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
tie it together after that you're going

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.270 
tie it together after that you're going
to<00:01:09.750> have<00:01:09.930> something<00:01:10.439> which<00:01:10.560> looks<00:01:10.590> like<00:01:10.890> this

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
to have something which looks like this

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.420 
to have something which looks like this
it's<00:01:11.610> going<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.970> look<00:01:12.240> like<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.659> loop<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.430> you

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
it's going to look like a loop and you

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.640 
it's going to look like a loop and you
will<00:01:14.610> hold<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.150> with<00:01:15.390> both<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.840> your<00:01:15.960> hands<00:01:16.259> and

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
will hold it with both of your hands and

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.520 
will hold it with both of your hands and
start<00:01:17.549> twisting<00:01:18.180> from<00:01:18.479> one<00:01:18.900> particular<00:01:19.350> hand

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
start twisting from one particular hand

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.410 
start twisting from one particular hand
so<00:01:19.740> let's<00:01:19.770> say<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.250> your<00:01:20.580> thread<00:01:20.880> you're

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
so let's say this is your thread you're

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.030 
so let's say this is your thread you're
going<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.600> start<00:01:21.810> twisting<00:01:22.320> from<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.770> it's

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
going to start twisting from this it's

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.700 
going to start twisting from this it's
like<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.360> keep<00:01:24.600> on<00:01:24.780> twisting<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.470> like

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
like this so you keep on twisting I like

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.060 
like this so you keep on twisting I like
to<00:01:25.799> twist<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.189> about<00:01:26.400> 10<00:01:26.729> times<00:01:27.920> and<00:01:28.920> after

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
to twist it about 10 times and after

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.190 
to twist it about 10 times and after
you've<00:01:29.369> twisted<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.939> ten<00:01:30.570> times<00:01:30.840> you'll

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
you've twisted it ten times you'll

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.140 
you've twisted it ten times you'll
realize<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.710> right<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.490> middle<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
realize that right in the middle of the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.289 
realize that right in the middle of the
thread<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:34.200> kind<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:34.530> have<00:01:34.710> ten<00:01:34.979> knots<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:36.030> it

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
thread you kind of have ten knots so it

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.719 
thread you kind of have ten knots so it
is<00:01:36.450> these<00:01:36.750> knots<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.409> are<00:01:37.560> going<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.920> let<00:01:38.430> me

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
is these knots that are going to let me

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.130 
is these knots that are going to let me
yank<00:01:39.060> out<00:01:39.270> your<00:01:39.299> hair

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
basically you have to thread it in the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:02:14.690 
basically you have to thread it in the
opposite<00:01:42.570> direction<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.290> hair<00:01:43.500> growth
