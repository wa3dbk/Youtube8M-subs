production specialist Dan first of all

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.470 
production specialist Dan first of all
what<00:00:23.220> what<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.609> this<00:00:23.789> take<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:23.970> looks<00:00:24.240> pretty

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
what what is this take it looks pretty

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.540 
what what is this take it looks pretty
robust<00:00:24.869> but<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.680> say<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:25.980> can<00:00:26.099> also<00:00:26.220> be<00:00:26.430> very

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
robust but you say it can also be very

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.130 
robust but you say it can also be very
delicate<00:00:26.970> at<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.119> same<00:00:27.269> time<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:27.990> a

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
delicate at the same time this is a

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.929 
delicate at the same time this is a
liquid<00:00:28.560> nitrogen<00:00:28.830> tank<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.369> we<00:00:29.460> use<00:00:29.699> to

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
liquid nitrogen tank that we use to

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.910 
liquid nitrogen tank that we use to
store<00:00:30.269> semen<00:00:30.660> with<00:00:30.810> on<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.349> farm<00:00:31.590> and

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
store semen with on the farm and

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.729 
store semen with on the farm and
essentially<00:00:32.399> all<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.899> tank<00:00:34.380> within<00:00:34.590> a

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
essentially all it is is a tank within a

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.869 
essentially all it is is a tank within a
tank<00:00:34.829> we<00:00:35.399> have<00:00:35.690> between<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.899> two<00:00:37.050> is

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
tank we have between the two is

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.030 
tank we have between the two is
insulation<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.480> vacuum<00:00:39.690> seal<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.950> know

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
insulation and a vacuum seal to you know

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.160 
insulation and a vacuum seal to you know
to<00:00:41.370> keep<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.730> nitrogen<00:00:42.480> from<00:00:42.600> evaporating

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
to keep the nitrogen from evaporating

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.590 
to keep the nitrogen from evaporating
and<00:00:44.510> so<00:00:45.590> again<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.329> one<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.450> things

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
and so again this is a one of the things

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.209 
and so again this is a one of the things
that's<00:00:48.690> overlooked<00:00:49.200> as<00:00:49.350> far<00:00:49.590> as<00:00:49.770> his

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
that's overlooked as far as his

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.040 
that's overlooked as far as his
management<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.180> semen<00:00:51.510> tank<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.899> again

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
management of a semen tank and again

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.869 
management of a semen tank and again
management<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.649> semen<00:00:53.070> as<00:00:53.579> far<00:00:53.820> as

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
management of the semen as far as

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.880 
management of the semen as far as
handling<00:00:54.090> as<00:00:54.420> far<00:00:54.600> as<00:00:54.690> loading<00:00:54.870> gun<00:00:55.199> from<00:00:55.530> from

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
handling as far as loading gun from from

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.740 
handling as far as loading gun from from
the<00:00:55.980> tank<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.550> cow<00:00:56.730> okay<00:00:57.329> well<00:00:57.600> let's

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750

deterioration<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:44.009> tank<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:45.390> it's

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
deterioration of the tank and and it's

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.969 
deterioration of the tank and and it's
an<00:01:45.840> it's<00:01:46.020> important<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.649> either<00:01:46.710> keep

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
an it's important that you either keep

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.910 
an it's important that you either keep
it<00:01:47.159> on<00:01:47.280> say<00:01:48.119> like<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.329> wooden<00:01:48.570> pallet<00:01:48.810> some<00:01:49.710> two

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
it on say like a wooden pallet some two

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.010 
it on say like a wooden pallet some two
before<00:01:50.220> blocks<00:01:50.549> just<00:01:50.909> off<00:01:51.149> any<00:01:51.360> concrete<00:01:51.659> or

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
before blocks just off any concrete or

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.240 
before blocks just off any concrete or
something<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.320> keep<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.560> raised<00:01:52.770> up<00:01:53.009> kind<00:01:53.189> of

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
something to keep it raised up kind of

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.830 
something to keep it raised up kind of
isolate<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.729> on<00:01:53.850> its<00:01:54.030> own<00:01:54.149> there<00:01:54.360> yes<00:01:54.600> uh-huh

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
isolate it on its own there yes uh-huh

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.139 
isolate it on its own there yes uh-huh
okay<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.579> other<00:01:56.700> thing<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:57.180> keep<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.079> for

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
okay and the other thing is keep it for

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.899 
okay and the other thing is keep it for
almost<00:02:00.740> I'll<00:02:01.740> say<00:02:02.009> just<00:02:02.040> almost<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.759> way

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
almost I'll say just almost in the way

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.740 
almost I'll say just almost in the way
because<00:02:03.659> again<00:02:04.560> one<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.479> things<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.630> can

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
because again one of the things you can

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.440 
because again one of the things you can
see<00:02:07.020> if<00:02:07.320> you're<00:02:07.619> starting<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.340> lose<00:02:08.520> vacuum<00:02:09.270> is

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
see if you're starting to lose vacuum is

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.190 
see if you're starting to lose vacuum is
as<00:02:09.959> we<00:02:10.200> lift<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.560> tank<00:02:11.520> up<00:02:11.730> you'll<00:02:11.970> see

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
as we lift this tank up you'll see

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.420 
as we lift this tank up you'll see
liquid

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
liquid

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.170 
liquid
or<00:02:14.000> vapor<00:02:14.299> I<00:02:14.480> don't<00:02:14.780> know<00:02:14.900> we<00:02:15.079> have<00:02:16.180> nitrogen

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
or vapor I don't know we have nitrogen

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.000 
or vapor I don't know we have nitrogen
still<00:02:17.269> on<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.599> tank<00:02:17.870> but<00:02:18.170> if<00:02:18.560> we<00:02:18.799> have<00:02:18.980> a

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
still on the tank but if we have a

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.670 
still on the tank but if we have a
vacuum<00:02:19.670> leak<00:02:20.120> we<00:02:20.329> might<00:02:20.540> see<00:02:20.840> Frost<00:02:21.230> starting

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
vacuum leak we might see Frost starting

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.589 
vacuum leak we might see Frost starting
to<00:02:21.829> develop<00:02:22.280> on<00:02:22.519> the<00:02:22.670> outs<00:02:22.819> on<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.120> outside

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
to develop on the outs on the outside

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.720 
to develop on the outs on the outside
and<00:02:23.930> that's<00:02:24.079> a<00:02:24.290> that's<00:02:24.590> a<00:02:24.769> key<00:02:24.980> sign<00:02:25.310> that<00:02:25.549> hey

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
and that's a that's a key sign that hey

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.690 
and that's a that's a key sign that hey
I've<00:02:25.939> got<00:02:26.120> trouble<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:26.689> you<00:02:27.290> need<00:02:27.319> to<00:02:27.700> you

talking<00:03:01.669> about<00:03:01.790> keeping<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.180> level<00:03:02.359> in<00:03:02.569> there

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:02.719 
talking about keeping the level in there

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:03.909 
talking about keeping the level in there
keeping<00:03:03.019> it<00:03:03.169> running<00:03:03.319> how<00:03:03.530> do<00:03:03.590> we<00:03:03.680> check<00:03:03.889> that

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:03.919 
keeping it running how do we check that

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:08.289 
keeping it running how do we check that
level<00:03:04.400> if<00:03:05.239> you<00:03:05.480> check<00:03:05.689> with<00:03:06.159> you<00:03:07.159> can<00:03:07.310> check

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
level if you check with you can check

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:09.849 
level if you check with you can check
with<00:03:08.450> inna<00:03:08.689> you<00:03:08.870> like<00:03:09.079> your<00:03:09.260> breeder<00:03:09.469> service

just a yardstick and again tanks should

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.710 
just a yardstick and again tanks should
be<00:03:16.519> checked<00:03:16.819> once<00:03:17.239> a<00:03:17.359> week<00:03:19.419> and<00:03:20.419> you<00:03:20.479> can<00:03:20.659> see

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
kind of the minimum that you need to be

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.629 
kind of the minimum that you need to be
worried<00:04:05.659> about<00:04:05.840> as<00:04:06.199> far<00:04:06.409> as<00:04:06.590> being<00:04:07.430> able<00:04:07.519> to

worried about as far as being able to

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:10.409 
worried about as far as being able to
get<00:04:07.790> it<00:04:07.909> filled<00:04:08.150> but<00:04:08.750> once<00:04:08.930> it<00:04:09.079> does<00:04:09.199> go<00:04:09.439> dry

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:10.419 
get it filled but once it does go dry

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:14.020 
get it filled but once it does go dry
again<00:04:12.099> whatever<00:04:13.099> seamen's<00:04:13.519> in<00:04:13.669> there

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
again whatever seamen's in there

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.509 
again whatever seamen's in there
you'll<00:04:14.629> lose<00:04:14.840> so<00:04:15.259> it's<00:04:15.829> very<00:04:15.919> important<00:04:16.400> that

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
you'll lose so it's very important that

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.229 
you'll lose so it's very important that

percentage this year was just not what
I've<00:04:36.690> had<00:04:36.900> in<00:04:36.990> the<00:04:37.050> past<00:04:37.160> I<00:04:38.160> go<00:04:38.730> back<00:04:38.880> to<00:04:39.000> very

I've had in the past I go back to very

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.170 
I've had in the past I go back to very
beginning<00:04:39.630> on<00:04:39.860> what<00:04:40.860> might<00:04:41.040> be<00:04:41.070> going<00:04:41.340> on<00:04:41.670> and

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
beginning on what might be going on and

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.020 
beginning on what might be going on and
I<00:04:42.240> started<00:04:42.660> to<00:04:42.810> tank<00:04:43.050> as<00:04:43.290> far<00:04:43.530> as<00:04:43.880> how<00:04:44.880> they

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
I started to tank as far as how they

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.280 
I started to tank as far as how they
handle<00:04:45.300> our<00:04:45.420> semen<00:04:46.070> and<00:04:47.070> that's<00:04:47.940> it<00:04:48.450> it<00:04:48.720> may

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
handle our semen and that's it it may

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.870 
handle our semen and that's it it may
not<00:04:49.440> be<00:04:49.590> the<00:04:49.710> technique<00:04:50.040> in<00:04:50.190> the<00:04:50.280> cow<00:04:50.430> maybe

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
not be the technique in the cow maybe

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.130 
not be the technique in the cow maybe
before<00:04:51.240> they<00:04:51.360> get<00:04:51.480> to<00:04:51.630> the<00:04:51.720> cow<00:04:51.870> and<00:04:52.020> that's

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
before they get to the cow and that's

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.430 
before they get to the cow and that's
that's<00:04:52.440> that<00:04:52.770> place<00:04:53.190> I<00:04:53.370> start<00:04:53.700> so<00:04:54.440> liquid

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
that's that place I start so liquid

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.030 
that's that place I start so liquid
nitrogen<00:04:55.710> is<00:04:55.860> minus<00:04:56.250> 320<00:04:56.910> as<00:04:57.870> you<00:04:58.290> go<00:04:58.440> up<00:04:58.620> into

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
nitrogen is minus 320 as you go up into

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.960 
nitrogen is minus 320 as you go up into

the tank temperature changes there is a

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.880 
the tank temperature changes there is a
frost<00:05:03.180> line<00:05:03.510> see<00:05:04.080> the<00:05:04.200> frost<00:05:04.500> line<00:05:04.590> right

I tell people lurk below the frost line

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.240 
I tell people lurk below the frost line
at<00:05:09.690> the<00:05:09.810> frost<00:05:10.050> line<00:05:10.170> that<00:05:10.530> that<00:05:10.860> level<00:05:11.070> is

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
at the frost line that that level is

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.750 
at the frost line that that level is
about<00:05:11.520> minus<00:05:12.090> 110<00:05:12.600> to<00:05:12.780> minus<00:05:13.050> 120<00:05:13.710> and<00:05:14.040> I'm<00:05:14.640> up

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
about minus 110 to minus 120 and I'm up

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.370 
about minus 110 to minus 120 and I'm up
that's<00:05:14.970> gonna<00:05:15.120> get<00:05:15.270> much<00:05:15.420> warmer<00:05:15.690> quickly<00:05:16.110> on

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
that's gonna get much warmer quickly on

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.520 
that's gonna get much warmer quickly on
