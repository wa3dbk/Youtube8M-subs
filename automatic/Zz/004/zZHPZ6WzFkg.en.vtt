00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
underestimate my opponent Tomas Tatar

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.929 
underestimate my opponent Tomas Tatar
this<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:34.320> like<00:01:34.619> all<00:01:34.829> Austrians<00:01:35.369> very<00:01:35.579> strong

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
this is like all Austrians very strong

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.140 
this is like all Austrians very strong
with<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.390> physical<00:01:37.320> shape<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.520> very

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
with the physical shape and this is very

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.789 
with the physical shape and this is very
important<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.720> have<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.930> good<00:01:40.079> feeling<00:01:40.439> on<00:01:40.650> the

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
important to have a good feeling on the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.810 
important to have a good feeling on the
hill<00:01:41.570> it's<00:01:42.570> some<00:01:43.049> points<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.979> do<00:01:44.100> for<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
hill it's some points to do for the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.670 
hill it's some points to do for the
overall<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.329> it's<00:01:45.509> gonna<00:01:45.720> be<00:01:45.930> really<00:01:46.140> close<00:01:46.439> I

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
overall and it's gonna be really close I

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.330 
overall and it's gonna be really close I
guess<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.369> in<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.729> end<00:01:47.960> yeah<00:01:49.070> are<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.189> looking

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
guess it in the end yeah are you looking

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.480 
guess it in the end yeah are you looking
forward<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.880> bishops<00:01:51.659> often<00:01:51.930> yeah<00:01:52.710> bishops

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
forward to bishops often yeah bishops

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.060 
forward to bishops often yeah bishops
often<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:54.079> better<00:01:55.079> for<00:01:55.320> me<00:01:55.470> because<00:01:55.829> the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
often is better for me because the

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.580 
often is better for me because the
rhythm<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.729> hill<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:57.719> easier<00:01:58.200> for<00:01:58.409> me<00:01:58.560> to

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
rhythm of the hill is easier for me to

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.120 
rhythm of the hill is easier for me to
read<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.670> jump<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:00.930> hill<00:02:01.140> it's

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
read and to jump on this hill it's

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.870 
read and to jump on this hill it's
better<00:02:02.399> for<00:02:02.640> my<00:02:02.790> style

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
better for my style

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.600 
better for my style
yeah<00:02:04.810> let's<00:02:05.200> see<00:02:05.380> it's<00:02:05.619> gonna<00:02:05.799> be<00:02:06.009> interesting
