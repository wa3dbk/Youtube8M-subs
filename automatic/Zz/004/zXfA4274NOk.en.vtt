is as you can see on a small fly here

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.560 
is as you can see on a small fly here
where<00:00:32.250> I've<00:00:32.340> got<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> lot<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.700> hackle<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.420> some

other things around here it's kind of

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.160 
other things around here it's kind of
difficult<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.309> get<00:00:35.520> in<00:00:35.640> with<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.820> big<00:00:36.059> brush<00:00:36.390> so

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
difficult to get in with a big brush so

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.290 
difficult to get in with a big brush so
you<00:00:37.200> can<00:00:37.559> use<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:37.920> little<00:00:38.190> tool<00:00:38.879> it's<00:00:39.149> got<00:00:39.270> a

you can use this little tool it's got a
very<00:00:39.540> small<00:00:39.690> little<00:00:40.350> dispenser<00:00:40.739> on<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.190> and

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
very small little dispenser on it and

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.650 
very small little dispenser on it and
you<00:00:41.430> just<00:00:41.460> squeeze<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.239> appropriate

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
you just squeeze in the appropriate

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.020 
you just squeeze in the appropriate
amount<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.050> glue<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.530> move<00:00:44.430> things<00:00:44.670> around<00:00:44.789> so

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
amount of glue and move things around so

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.630 
amount of glue and move things around so
it's<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.270> very<00:00:45.480> precise<00:00:46.110> application<00:00:46.739> or

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
it's a very precise application or

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.020 
it's a very precise application or
applicator<00:00:48.920> some<00:00:49.920> people<00:00:50.160> like<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.610> some

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
people don't if you're gonna do a lot of

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.150 
people don't if you're gonna do a lot of
glue<00:00:54.719> applications<00:00:55.350> specifically<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:55.980> some

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
glue applications specifically in some

glue applications specifically in some
big<00:00:56.340> bigger<00:00:56.640> flies<00:00:56.940> etc<00:00:57.660> there's<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.350> couple<00:00:58.559> of

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
big bigger flies etc there's a couple of

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.580 
big bigger flies etc there's a couple of
other<00:00:58.859> things<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.370> would<00:00:59.640> use<00:01:00.379> number<00:01:01.379> one

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
other things that I would use number one

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.640 
other things that I would use number one
would<00:01:02.460> be<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:03.000> product<00:01:03.390> called<00:01:03.660> hard<00:01:04.019> as<00:01:04.260> hull

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
would be a product called hard as hull

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.670 
would be a product called hard as hull
and<00:01:05.010> it's<00:01:05.729> actually<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.390> blue<00:01:06.600> bottle<00:01:07.020> it's

about four or five dollars and it does a

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.820 
about four or five dollars and it does a
very<00:01:09.150> nice<00:01:09.479> job<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.990> creates<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.350> real<00:01:10.619> nice

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
and the head of a fly if you're not

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.130 
and the head of a fly if you're not
interested<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.600> know<00:01:18.689> spending<00:01:18.990> that

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
much money you can actually just go to

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.760 
much money you can actually just go to
your<00:01:20.610> local<00:01:20.759> drug<00:01:21.600> store<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.840> get<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.259> Sally

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.380 
Hansen product called hard-as-nails and
that<00:01:26.070> works<00:01:26.310> out<00:01:26.430> extremely<00:01:26.790> well<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.210> think

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
that works out extremely well I think

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.230 
that works out extremely well I think
this<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.600> like<00:01:27.720> two<00:01:27.900> dollars<00:01:28.049> for<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.500> bottle

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
this is like two dollars for the bottle

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.780 
this is like two dollars for the bottle

a glue that you'll want to keep in your
fly<00:01:33.119> bench<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:34.049> product<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.280> would<00:01:35.640> be

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
fly bench is a product that would be

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.840 
fly bench is a product that would be
zappa<00:01:36.479> gap<00:01:36.750> or<00:01:37.020> any<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:39.500> super<00:01:40.500> glues

zappa gap or any of the super glues

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.160 
zappa gap or any of the super glues
cyanoacrylate<00:01:41.850> i<00:01:42.299> believe<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.840> actual

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
cyanoacrylate i believe is the actual

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.380 
cyanoacrylate i believe is the actual
term<00:01:43.380> for<00:01:43.799> them<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.579> typically<00:01:44.939> go<00:01:45.149> with<00:01:45.360> a

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
term for them and I typically go with a

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.569 
term for them and I typically go with a
little<00:01:45.659> bit<00:01:45.840> thicker<00:01:46.140> one<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:47.399> that's

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
little bit thicker one and that's

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.830 
little bit thicker one and that's
designed<00:01:47.790> if<00:01:48.149> you're<00:01:48.270> going<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.450> be<00:01:48.540> doing<00:01:48.689> a

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
designed if you're going to be doing a

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.139 
designed if you're going to be doing a
lot<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.020> buildup<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.560> flies<00:01:49.770> etc<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.909> want

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
lot of buildup of flies etc and you want

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.690 
lot of buildup of flies etc and you want
to<00:01:51.360> lock<00:01:51.750> maybe<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.229> rabbit<00:01:52.979> fur<00:01:53.130> strip<00:01:53.490> down<00:01:53.640> to

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
to lock maybe a rabbit fur strip down to

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.690 
to lock maybe a rabbit fur strip down to
the<00:01:54.000> hook<00:01:54.149> hook<00:01:54.810> shank<00:01:55.049> etc<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:56.250> really<00:01:56.520> want

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
the hook hook shank etc you really want

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.510 
the hook hook shank etc you really want
to<00:01:56.790> do<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.030> with<00:01:57.240> superglue<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.229> then<00:01:58.920> this

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
to do that with superglue and then this

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.230 
to do that with superglue and then this
particular<00:01:59.729> one<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.780> an<00:02:01.290> actual<00:02:01.680> gel<00:02:02.240> it

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
particular one is a an actual gel it

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.969 
particular one is a an actual gel it
works<00:02:03.479> out<00:02:03.659> extremely<00:02:03.960> well<00:02:04.170> it's<00:02:04.530> very<00:02:04.710> thick

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
works out extremely well it's very thick

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.889 
works out extremely well it's very thick
and<00:02:05.130> gooey<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.579> use<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:06.000> one<00:02:06.149> as<00:02:06.360> well<00:02:06.420> and

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
and gooey so I use that one as well and

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.100 
and gooey so I use that one as well and
then<00:02:07.740> finally<00:02:07.879> the<00:02:08.879> trick<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.690> lot<00:02:10.080> of

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
then finally the trick that a lot of

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.680 
then finally the trick that a lot of
people<00:02:10.440> will<00:02:10.649> use<00:02:10.679> if<00:02:11.069> they<00:02:11.190> want<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.550> build<00:02:12.360> up

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
people will use if they want to build up

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.309 
people will use if they want to build up
a<00:02:12.959> trim

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
a trim

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.920 
a trim
this<00:02:13.590> amount<00:02:14.069> of<00:02:14.249> epoxy<00:02:15.120> on<00:02:15.299> the<00:02:15.569> head<00:02:15.749> of<00:02:15.870> a

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
this amount of epoxy on the head of a

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.559 
this amount of epoxy on the head of a
fly<00:02:16.200> maybe<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.769> blew<00:02:17.310> in<00:02:17.459> and<00:02:17.579> I<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.420> want

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
fly maybe you blew in and I and you want

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.239 
fly maybe you blew in and I and you want
to<00:02:18.659> build<00:02:18.870> up<00:02:19.019> that<00:02:19.049> epoxy<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.739> cover

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:20.249 
to build up that epoxy to cover

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:23.089 
to build up that epoxy to cover
everything<00:02:20.579> would<00:02:21.420> be<00:02:21.629> just<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.680> would<00:02:23.010> be

is your base layer that you can build up
you<00:02:39.359> can<00:02:39.480> use<00:02:39.629> either<00:02:39.870> one<00:02:39.989> it<00:02:40.319> just<00:02:40.349> depends

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
you can use either one it just depends

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.589 
you can use either one it just depends
on<00:02:40.859> how<00:02:41.010> much<00:02:41.250> finish<00:02:41.700> you're<00:02:41.909> going<00:02:41.939> to<00:02:42.329> build

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
on how much finish you're going to build

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.050 
on how much finish you're going to build
up<00:02:42.810> in<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.799> old<00:02:43.980> days<00:02:44.189> what<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.459> would<00:02:44.730> do<00:02:44.879> is

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
up in the old days what you would do is

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.970 
up in the old days what you would do is
you<00:02:45.180> would<00:02:45.209> put<00:02:45.930> some<00:02:46.079> epoxy<00:02:46.560> on<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.769> head<00:02:46.889> of

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
you would put some epoxy on the head of

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.129 
you would put some epoxy on the head of
a<00:02:47.040> hook<00:02:47.219> and<00:02:47.400> then<00:02:47.459> it<00:02:48.030> would<00:02:48.150> rotate<00:02:48.389> in<00:02:48.930> a

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
a hook and then it would rotate in a

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.129 
a hook and then it would rotate in a
another<00:02:49.919> device<00:02:50.310> until<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:51.090> epoxy<00:02:51.870> dried

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
another device until the epoxy dried

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.619 
another device until the epoxy dried
well<00:02:52.439> that<00:02:52.709> may<00:02:52.829> take<00:02:53.040> 10-15<00:02:53.760> minutes<00:02:54.090> or<00:02:54.239> so

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
well that may take 10-15 minutes or so

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.189 
well that may take 10-15 minutes or so
this<00:02:55.530> system<00:02:55.919> is<00:02:56.069> such<00:02:56.250> that<00:02:56.280> you<00:02:56.609> just<00:02:56.849> simply

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:57.199 
this system is such that you just simply

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:01.759 
this system is such that you just simply
apply<00:02:58.669> where<00:02:59.669> you<00:02:59.790> want<00:02:59.969> the<00:03:00.090> epoxy<00:03:00.599> and<00:03:00.769> then

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
apply where you want the epoxy and then

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.550 
apply where you want the epoxy and then
shine<00:03:02.609> a<00:03:03.060> special<00:03:03.599> light<00:03:03.810> in<00:03:03.989> this<00:03:04.109> case<00:03:04.319> it<00:03:04.530> is

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
shine a special light in this case it is

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.240 
shine a special light in this case it is
a<00:03:04.680> blue<00:03:05.040> light<00:03:05.310> like<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:05.699> dentist's<00:03:06.239> light

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
a blue light like the dentist's light

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.640 
a blue light like the dentist's light
shine<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:08.430> onto<00:03:08.609> the<00:03:09.230> epoxy<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.409> it<00:03:10.560> will

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
shine it onto the epoxy and it will

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.860 
shine it onto the epoxy and it will
actually<00:03:11.069> dry<00:03:11.400> in<00:03:11.669> about<00:03:11.790> 20<00:03:12.359> seconds

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
actually dry in about 20 seconds

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.490 
actually dry in about 20 seconds
works<00:03:13.469> out<00:03:13.620> very<00:03:13.919> very<00:03:14.010> well<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.989> finally<00:03:15.989> if

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
works out very very well and finally if

be<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.590> get<00:03:34.709> some<00:03:35.540> black<00:03:36.540> nail<00:03:36.780> polish<00:03:36.989> or<00:03:37.379> some

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:37.979 
be to get some black nail polish or some

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:41.599 
be to get some black nail polish or some
red<00:03:38.159> in<00:03:38.310> this<00:03:38.430> case<00:03:38.639> I<00:03:38.790> have<00:03:38.939> one<00:03:39.359> of<00:03:39.659> each<00:03:40.609> so

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
red in this case I have one of each so

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.399 
red in this case I have one of each so
relatively<00:03:42.449> simple<00:03:42.989> but<00:03:43.079> of<00:03:43.199> course

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
relatively simple but of course

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.379 
relatively simple but of course
extremely<00:03:43.709> important<00:03:44.400> you<00:03:44.729> don't<00:03:45.090> always

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
extremely important you don't always

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:50.869 
extremely important you don't always
have<00:03:45.689> to<00:03:46.970> glue<00:03:47.970> down<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:49.009> the<00:03:50.009> thread<00:03:50.639> to<00:03:50.790> the

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
have to glue down the the thread to the

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.849 
have to glue down the the thread to the
head<00:03:51.000> you<00:03:51.150> can<00:03:51.329> even<00:03:51.479> use<00:03:51.689> a<00:03:51.720> wax<00:03:52.079> product<00:03:52.650> and

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
head you can even use a wax product and

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.559 
head you can even use a wax product and
that<00:03:52.949> would<00:03:53.099> be<00:03:53.189> waxing<00:03:53.639> your<00:03:53.849> thread<00:03:54.180> you

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
that would be waxing your thread you

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.719 
that would be waxing your thread you
would<00:03:55.470> keep<00:03:55.650> a<00:03:55.859> little<00:03:56.189> bit<00:03:56.280> of<00:03:56.430> this<00:03:56.489> you<00:03:56.609> have

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:56.729 
would keep a little bit of this you have

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:58.219 
would keep a little bit of this you have
to<00:03:56.759> work<00:03:57.030> it<00:03:57.180> and<00:03:57.359> it<00:03:57.569> actually<00:03:57.780> will<00:03:58.079> get

00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:58.229 
to work it and it actually will get

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:00.349 
to work it and it actually will get
softer<00:03:58.709> and<00:03:59.159> I<00:03:59.340> usually<00:03:59.669> dab<00:03:59.879> it<00:04:00.060> onto<00:04:00.239> my

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
softer and I usually dab it onto my

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:01.699 
softer and I usually dab it onto my
finger<00:04:00.689> here<00:04:00.930> and<00:04:01.049> then<00:04:01.139> you<00:04:01.290> would<00:04:01.439> literally

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
finger here and then you would literally

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.309 
finger here and then you would literally
pull<00:04:02.129> down<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:02.819> put<00:04:03.329> this<00:04:03.449> layer<00:04:03.689> of<00:04:03.900> wax<00:04:04.139> on

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
pull down and put this layer of wax on

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.920 
pull down and put this layer of wax on
thread<00:04:04.889> and<00:04:05.069> then<00:04:05.579> you<00:04:05.729> could<00:04:05.969> wrap<00:04:06.180> it<00:04:06.389> some

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
thread and then you could wrap it some

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.240 
thread and then you could wrap it some
people<00:04:07.199> especially<00:04:07.349> the<00:04:07.650> more<00:04:07.799> traditional

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
people especially the more traditional

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.640 
people especially the more traditional
fly<00:04:08.430> tyers<00:04:08.669> like<00:04:09.150> this<00:04:09.419> it<00:04:09.959> also<00:04:10.109> works<00:04:10.439> very

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
fly tyers like this it also works very

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.589 
fly tyers like this it also works very
good<00:04:10.769> during<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.489> tying<00:04:11.729> process<00:04:12.329> if<00:04:12.509> you're

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
good during the tying process if you're

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.619 
good during the tying process if you're
putting<00:04:12.900> a<00:04:12.959> lot<00:04:13.109> of<00:04:13.259> materials<00:04:13.769> on<00:04:14.009> the<00:04:14.250> fly

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
putting a lot of materials on the fly

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.080 
putting a lot of materials on the fly
where<00:04:15.629> when<00:04:16.109> you<00:04:16.229> wrap<00:04:16.549> all<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:17.729> need<00:04:17.849> is<00:04:17.940> one

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
where when you wrap all you need is one

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.879 
where when you wrap all you need is one
or<00:04:18.209> two<00:04:18.239> thread<00:04:18.719> wraps<00:04:18.959> with<00:04:19.199> this<00:04:19.380> wax<00:04:19.620> thread

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
or two thread wraps with this wax thread

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.500 
or two thread wraps with this wax thread
and<00:04:20.130> it<00:04:20.219> pinches<00:04:20.519> everything<00:04:20.940> down<00:04:21.209> nice<00:04:21.479> and

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
and it pinches everything down nice and

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.439 
and it pinches everything down nice and
tight<00:04:21.719> so<00:04:22.169> that's<00:04:22.710> another<00:04:22.979> product<00:04:23.449> finally

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
tight so that's another product finally

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:26.780 
tight so that's another product finally
I<00:04:24.779> think<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.320> next<00:04:25.650> and<00:04:25.830> last

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
I think the next and last

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.390 
I think the next and last
tool<00:04:27.600> we<00:04:27.870> will<00:04:27.960> talk<00:04:28.200> about<00:04:28.350> is<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.680> fly<00:04:29.070> tying

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
tool we will talk about is the fly tying

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.870 
tool we will talk about is the fly tying
bench<00:04:29.850> what<00:04:30.660> it<00:04:30.780> is<00:04:30.930> how<00:04:31.500> its<00:04:31.680> organized<00:04:32.130> etc

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
bench what it is how its organized etc

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.730 
bench what it is how its organized etc
and<00:04:33.120> then<00:04:33.750> from<00:04:33.930> there<00:04:34.110> we'll<00:04:34.230> actually<00:04:34.620> go

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
and then from there we'll actually go

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.980 
and then from there we'll actually go
into<00:04:34.920> some<00:04:35.160> other<00:04:35.640> materials<00:04:36.210> threads<00:04:37.310> furs

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
into some other materials threads furs

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.680 
into some other materials threads furs
etc<00:04:39.990> thank<00:04:40.560> you
