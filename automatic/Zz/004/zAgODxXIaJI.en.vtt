store that steam under pressure and what
that<00:00:56.340> means<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:57.510> you're<00:00:57.629> gonna<00:00:57.780> have<00:00:57.989> to

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
that means that you're gonna have to

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.139 
that means that you're gonna have to
turn<00:00:58.289> them<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:58.559> fill<00:00:59.280> them<00:00:59.399> up<00:00:59.460> with<00:00:59.520> water<00:00:59.699> and

turn them on fill them up with water and

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.819 
turn them on fill them up with water and
then<00:01:00.420> wait<00:01:00.629> for<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:00.960> water<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.469> get<00:01:01.590> hot

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
then wait for that water to get hot

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.189 
then wait for that water to get hot
enough<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.129> boil<00:01:02.460> into<00:01:02.789> steam<00:01:03.030> for<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:03.989> small

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
enough to boil into steam for a small

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.380 
enough to boil into steam for a small
portable<00:01:04.530> unit<00:01:04.890> like<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.250> it's<00:01:06.030> really<00:01:06.090> no

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
portable unit like this it's really no

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.289 
portable unit like this it's really no
problems<00:01:06.869> because<00:01:07.290> it's<00:01:07.470> small<00:01:07.740> but<00:01:08.700> because

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
problems because it's small but because

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.630 
problems because it's small but because
it's<00:01:09.510> mild<00:01:09.750> its<00:01:10.229> internal<00:01:10.830> steam<00:01:11.100> vessel<00:01:11.549> is

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
it's mild its internal steam vessel is

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.149 
it's mild its internal steam vessel is
going<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.939> be<00:01:12.030> small<00:01:12.330> why<00:01:12.689> not<00:01:13.650> even<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.920> size

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
going to be small why not even the size

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.630 
going to be small why not even the size
of<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.369> soda<00:01:14.580> can<00:01:15.259> that<00:01:16.259> means<00:01:16.500> it's<00:01:16.950> only<00:01:17.100> only

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
of a soda can that means it's only only

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.580 
of a soda can that means it's only only
going<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.850> generate<00:01:18.150> pressures<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.750> maybe<00:01:19.049> 50

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
going to generate pressures of maybe 50

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
pounds per square inch they can cool off

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.810 
pounds per square inch they can cool off
rather<00:01:22.049> quickly<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.740> after<00:01:23.159> extended<00:01:23.790> use

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
rather quickly and after extended use

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.740 
rather quickly and after extended use
can<00:01:24.450> really<00:01:25.170> run<00:01:25.320> out<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.530> steam<00:01:26.509> but<00:01:27.509> for<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
can really run out of steam but for the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.260 
can really run out of steam but for the
shop<00:01:27.960> units<00:01:28.409> on<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.340> other<00:01:29.490> hand<00:01:29.820> that's

really<00:01:30.659> not<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.840> problem<00:01:32.210> because<00:01:33.210> they<00:01:33.780> are

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
really not a problem because they are

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.219 
really not a problem because they are
going<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.290> have<00:01:34.560> an<00:01:34.710> internal<00:01:35.070> boiler<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:36.229> one

takes forever to refill one of these
reheat<00:03:07.349> it<00:03:07.470> and<00:03:07.560> get<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:07.769> ready<00:03:07.889> to<00:03:08.069> go<00:03:08.190> again

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
now the silver dragon does not have an

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.210 
now the silver dragon does not have an
internal<00:03:12.599> boiler<00:03:13.019> like<00:03:13.349> those<00:03:13.560> other<00:03:13.739> units

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
internal boiler like those other units

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.890 
internal boiler like those other units
it's<00:03:14.819> what's<00:03:15.030> called<00:03:15.180> an<00:03:15.329> atmospheric

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
it's what's called an atmospheric

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.500 
it's what's called an atmospheric
steamer<00:03:16.230> it<00:03:16.829> uses<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.400> same<00:03:17.579> technology<00:03:17.819> that

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
steamer it uses the same technology that

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.800 
steamer it uses the same technology that
a<00:03:18.810> flash<00:03:19.620> steam<00:03:20.069> generator<00:03:20.730> would<00:03:20.940> use<00:03:21.120> what

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
a flash steam generator would use what

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.659 
a flash steam generator would use what
does<00:03:21.900> that<00:03:21.930> mean<00:03:22.230> well<00:03:22.620> it<00:03:22.829> means<00:03:23.190> that<00:03:23.459> it

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:23.669 
does that mean well it means that it

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:25.809 
does that mean well it means that it
makes<00:03:23.879> steam<00:03:24.209> as<00:03:24.389> you<00:03:24.840> need<00:03:25.109> it

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
makes steam as you need it

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.369 
makes steam as you need it
so<00:03:26.819> to<00:03:26.879> use<00:03:27.030> a<00:03:27.060> silver<00:03:27.510> dragon<00:03:27.720> you're<00:03:28.199> gonna

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
so to use a silver dragon you're gonna

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:29.990 
so to use a silver dragon you're gonna
turn<00:03:28.680> it<00:03:28.829> on<00:03:28.919> and<00:03:29.250> you're<00:03:29.370> gonna<00:03:29.489> let<00:03:29.699> it<00:03:29.730> heat

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
turn it on and you're gonna let it heat

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.430 
turn it on and you're gonna let it heat
up<00:03:30.030> it's<00:03:30.569> only<00:03:30.629> gonna<00:03:30.840> take<00:03:30.930> about<00:03:31.079> ten

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
up it's only gonna take about ten

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.369 
up it's only gonna take about ten
minutes<00:03:32.329> because<00:03:33.329> it<00:03:33.480> doesn't<00:03:33.810> have<00:03:33.930> a<00:03:33.959> boiler

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379
