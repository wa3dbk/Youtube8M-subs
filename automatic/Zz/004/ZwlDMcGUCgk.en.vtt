00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:22.980
 was the gum or bring your vow of the Lord 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:25.410
 say yes 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.359
 Hi, people, I'm even imagined and not 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.910
 It came from where I come in phase 1 was 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.239
 very different from the format of a 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.680
 guitar looks really cool is very charming 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.710
 people you will like 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.260
 Let's learn, let's need cardboard. 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.290
 a piece of paper will make a cardboard 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.860
 thinner contact black hot glue 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.750
 classic paste or transparency 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.760
 stylus and scissors with the first step 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.559
 Are you cutting mold is available 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.539
 here in the video description and also there 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.219
 on my facebook page the part of 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.680
 He has a good team on the top of the car. 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.219
 this part you're gonna cut 5 a little bit 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.710
 more 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.660
 already another part you will cut the band 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.060
 And who are you going to put? 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.520
 dotted with dotted ribbon and sam 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.369
 with a cousin you're going to cut and the 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.350
 two molds one square meter cast in 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.240
 a small rectangle more so 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.000
 then you will put the mold on top 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.189
 the cardboard and I did it in confines here in 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.619
 strategic locations that do not 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.759
 then to continue the route and it is only 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.710
 pass the outline 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.960
 the ideal is that you are such a cardboard 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.540
 very strict also that mine has two 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.939
 calls what I save only once 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.860
 each far or if you find a cardboard 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.020
 so thinner with just one outlet 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.240
 then you will cut twice each 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.100
 Now I'm going to take that part off. 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.200
 which I put on the tram and fill 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.049
 this space had no tape to cut 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.390
 just cut that the report the two and 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.970
 now it 's just him boy using kompakt 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.430
 prize as it soaks this side always 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.590
 put upside down try to leave 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.340
 always space around to fold to 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.740
 inside 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.890
 I'm going to cut about 12 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.920
 centimeters 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.240
 3 and now it's just you doing it and 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.490
 folding in 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.380
 When you get nipped so these tips are 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.750
 only you look inside cut out the 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.790
 excess and let's do it all around 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.920
 and after what we 're going to do 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.780
 also a small square that doubled 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.730
 into the same shape when you 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.260
 fold back here 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.260
 it is showing some parts of the 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.450
 cardboard is just a small square and 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.760
 have that one inside and just do it 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.270
 the four tips is to cut a piece of 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.060
 transparency of 16 cm by 12 and I will 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.030
 paste it back here you can paste 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.380
 using the contact itself 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.050
 take advantage of contact works to and from 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.880
 gluing and now use the hot glue 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.800
 or save part of the guitar to 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.690
 another passes the hot glue well contour 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.090
 then I tightened one-centimeter strips 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.140
 to pass here every time to 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.140
 comply without forecast 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.680
 and let's do this until we cover the whole 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.660
 guitar outline 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.049
 then you'll cut into the motel parana 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.180
 a piece containing 24 centimeters for 8 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:10.000
 There you are going to divide two centimeters 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.070
 8cm 10cm in 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.320
 four centimeters later you go 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.680
 pass the stylus on this mark 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.870
 without separating and there you will double doing 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.720
 this said this part we will skip 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.360
 here but rather well able contact and we 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.790
 Let's face this part with him folded. 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.340
 that way and then I'll go with him 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.430
 way here remembering that from 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.110
 two centimeters rt the bottom and 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.600
 then the part of four centimeters 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.820
 above and then you pass the hot 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.560
 bottom and need first 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.390
 comes the center 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.370
 Anyway, people here are part of the bottom line. 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.440
 After taking off from here, I'll give you another one. 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.590
 piece of contact for thin it's for 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.880
 Aim for well now you'll tip it 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.860
 stand at an angle that you 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.440
 I wanted her to stand that glue 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.390
 It's hot in this part and it's only behind and there 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.180
 you will paste the closer you are to the more 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.520
 tilted and reversed 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.800
 and then I'll paste the contact that though 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.290
 also to leave it fixed and now it's just 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.330
 You choose your picture to put here. 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.190
 in some cases it is necessary to remember a 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.010
 A little I took an inch here 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:20.160
 underneath my cute is just coming to find the 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.160
 photo behind the test 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.350
 Here we are, if you count on today. 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.960
 Do not forget to click to enjoy it. 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.090
 still because the overalls please here 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.800
 this side has two previous months 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.110
 if you missed one of them just play in 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:39.420
 that is already directed and we see 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.420
 in the next video kiss, bye
