is<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.940> number<00:02:16.180> one<00:02:16.360> mean<00:02:16.569> anything<00:02:16.930> that's

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
is the number one mean anything that's

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.830 
is the number one mean anything that's
our<00:02:17.620> road<00:02:17.980> number<00:02:18.489> okay<00:02:18.849> it's<00:02:19.269> not<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.480> first

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
our road number okay it's not the first

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.690 
our road number okay it's not the first
locomotive<00:02:20.230> in<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.680> world<00:02:20.860> this<00:02:21.340> is<00:02:21.519> number

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
locomotive in the world this is number

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.440 
locomotive in the world this is number
one<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:23.170> big<00:02:23.319> local<00:02:23.680> noise<00:02:23.860> number<00:02:24.190> two

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
one the big local noise number two

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.280 
one the big local noise number two
probably<00:02:25.450> if<00:02:25.540> you've<00:02:25.660> got<00:02:25.780> another<00:02:25.989> one<00:02:26.080> it

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
probably if you've got another one it

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.259 
probably if you've got another one it
would<00:02:26.379> be<00:02:26.500> number<00:02:26.769> three<00:02:27.220> we<00:02:27.430> had<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.730> three<00:02:28.090> and

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
would be number three we had a three and

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.660 
would be number three we had a three and
that<00:02:28.420> went<00:02:28.599> to<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.840> Smithsonian<00:02:29.170> okay<00:02:30.040> but<00:02:30.519> to
