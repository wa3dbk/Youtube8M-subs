00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.180
 the crowd has thousands of characters 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.370

 when you play with friends your murder in 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.580
 the air has freed me from being discovered 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.590
 Detection is an experience 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.550
 totally different and has a 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.550
 different result 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.360
 to meet the guards instigating the 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.450
 crowd to enter the palace by the 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.909
 door 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.100
 the large groups are actually one 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.289
 of the inhabitants of paris the factions 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.729
 rivals fight for control in the 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.600
 bloody stories of the revolution 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.600
 french 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.880
 although we have entered the palace by 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.100
 the front door two of our friends 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.770
 they have found another entry and they have 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.719
 helped just in time the experience 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.129
 online community reaches its best 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.619
 moment and in those moments of 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.540
 synchronization to the sant for a friend or 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.720
 avoid being detected or when entering 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.840
 open combat that is our goal 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.459
 is very protected we should continue 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.510
 touring the palace and waiting for 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.239
 best time to attack 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.189
 luckily a friend has used his 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.519
 ability to third lower doors and 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:32.620
 open an alternative road in juniti 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.980
 you have different ways to execute your 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.930
 strategy is freedom united to the 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.610
 random elements like the guards 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.290
 the places the roads with the 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.060
 rewards that were given a 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.060
 unique experience in each game 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.390
 i 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.190
 that has been getting closer they almost detected me 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.890
 those two guards but my friend 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.840
 intervened before he has returned the 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.960
 please take care of the last one with my weapons 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.090
 and kilos to the ghost leaf 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.370
 this place is called the gardens of 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.670
 luxembourg is one of the many sites 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.800
 historical you'll see in the game from 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.110
 the cathedral of notre-dame to the dark 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.060
 tunnels of the catacombs you will travel 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.270
 Paris in a way you never had 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.270
 imagined 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:38.730
 now at brand and management parties 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.720
 again 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.720
 that pushes 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.099
 do not 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.500
 playing with friends implies that combat 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.230
 is more intense cooperative and more 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.480
 challenging 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.000
 together you can cover larger areas 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.780
 plan to create a strategy and finish 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.780
 with greater threats 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.610
 or not 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.070

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.389
