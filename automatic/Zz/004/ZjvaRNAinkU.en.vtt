00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.160 
well there are lots of different reasons
I<00:00:05.640> think<00:00:05.700> perhaps<00:00:06.060> our<00:00:06.540> most<00:00:06.750> important

specific areas the other reason I think

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.640 
specific areas the other reason I think
it's<00:00:30.510> very<00:00:30.720> good<00:00:30.869> study<00:00:31.170> at<00:00:31.260> postgraduate

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
it's very good study at postgraduate

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.190 
it's very good study at postgraduate
level<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.520> in<00:00:32.850> terms<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.090> employability<00:00:33.480> it's

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
level is in terms of employability it's

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.010 
level is in terms of employability it's
the<00:00:34.590> skills<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:35.309> postgraduate<00:00:36.059> study<00:00:36.329> gives

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
the skills that postgraduate study gives

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.310 
the skills that postgraduate study gives
you<00:00:37.230> for<00:00:38.190> example<00:00:38.730> although<00:00:39.510> undergraduate

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
you for example although undergraduate

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.200 
you for example although undergraduate
level<00:00:40.590> we<00:00:40.680> do<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> lot<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.070> work<00:00:41.280> on<00:00:41.489> critical

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
level we do a lot of work on critical

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.030 
level we do a lot of work on critical
thought<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.780> analysis<00:00:43.290> we<00:00:43.469> take<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.800> much

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
thought and analysis we take that much

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.310 
thought and analysis we take that much
further<00:00:44.399> social<00:00:45.149> sciences<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:45.660> psychology<00:00:46.230> at

further social sciences in psychology at
postgraduate<00:00:46.649> level<00:00:46.829> where<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.610> really

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
postgraduate level where you really

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.760 
postgraduate level where you really
teach<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.360> how<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.989> take<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> particular

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
teach you how to take a particular

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.830 
teach you how to take a particular
question<00:00:50.129> how<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.700> look<00:00:50.969> at<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.180> in<00:00:51.270> depth<00:00:51.510> how

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
question how to look at it in depth how

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.049 
question how to look at it in depth how
to<00:00:51.899> look<00:00:52.260> at<00:00:52.350> research<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.250> look<00:00:53.370> at<00:00:53.489> policy

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
to look at research and look at policy

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.200 
to look at research and look at policy
very<00:00:54.719> critically<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.500> analytically<00:00:56.120> so<00:00:57.120> you

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
very critically and analytically so you

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.819 
very critically and analytically so you
know<00:00:57.329> take<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.809> pieces<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.379> see<00:00:58.559> where<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
know take it to pieces to see where the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.319 
know take it to pieces to see where the
problems<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.340> strengths<00:00:59.699> might<00:00:59.879> be<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.180> put

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
problems and strengths might be and put

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.580 
problems and strengths might be and put
it<00:01:00.390> back<00:01:00.480> together<00:01:00.629> again<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.230> try<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.440> come

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
it back together again and try to come

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.369 
it back together again and try to come
up<00:01:01.649> with<00:01:01.739> solutions<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:03.000> key<00:01:03.539> social<00:01:04.080> and

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
up with solutions to key social and

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.800 
up with solutions to key social and
psychological<00:01:04.500> problems<00:01:05.570> there<00:01:06.570> are<00:01:06.659> other

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
psychological problems there are other

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.960 
psychological problems there are other
employability<00:01:07.530> skills<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:08.549> we<00:01:08.939> teach

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
employability skills that we teach

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.280 
employability skills that we teach
they're<00:01:09.299> really<00:01:09.510> important<00:01:09.990> there's<00:01:10.200> some

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
they're really important there's some

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.560 
they're really important there's some
basic<00:01:10.619> things<00:01:10.650> like<00:01:10.950> how<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.580> write<00:01:12.150> research

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
basic things like how to write research

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.230 
basic things like how to write research
reports<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.290> policy<00:01:14.100> oriented<00:01:14.280> reports<00:01:14.880> now

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
reports and policy oriented reports now

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.460 
reports and policy oriented reports now
again<00:01:15.360> we<00:01:15.570> teach<00:01:15.750> those<00:01:15.930> at<00:01:16.080> undergraduate

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
again we teach those at undergraduate

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.740 
again we teach those at undergraduate
level<00:01:16.650> with<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.460> postgraduate<00:01:18.060> level<00:01:18.360> we

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
level with a postgraduate level we

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.359 
level with a postgraduate level we
really<00:01:19.020> give<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> skills<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:20.070> would

we teach is how to do independent

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.370 
we teach is how to do independent
learning<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.250> research<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.329> we<00:01:34.020> do<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> lot<00:01:34.320> of

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
learning and research so we do a lot of

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.929 
learning and research so we do a lot of
hand<00:01:34.650> holding<00:01:34.740> at<00:01:35.100> undergraduate<00:01:35.490> level<00:01:35.670> we

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
hand holding at undergraduate level we

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.999 
hand holding at undergraduate level we
supply<00:01:36.270> lots<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.900> material<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.560> show<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.890> how
