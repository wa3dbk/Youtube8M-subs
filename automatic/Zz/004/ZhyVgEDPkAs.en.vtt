00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
learn it it but it does take a lot of

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.380 
learn it it but it does take a lot of
practice<00:03:54.680> we've<00:03:55.099> had<00:03:55.340> a<00:03:55.370> lot<00:03:55.730> of<00:03:55.760> students

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
practice we've had a lot of students

practice we've had a lot of students
that<00:03:56.510> come<00:03:56.569> in<00:03:57.019> one<00:03:57.319> day<00:03:57.530> right<00:03:57.560> after<00:03:58.040> the

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
that come in one day right after the

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.910 
that come in one day right after the
quanto<00:03:58.819> festival<00:03:59.269> or<00:03:59.330> something<00:03:59.540> sign<00:04:00.530> up<00:04:00.709> for

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
quanto festival or something sign up for

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.830 
quanto festival or something sign up for
class<00:04:01.129> and<00:04:01.580> then<00:04:01.790> two<00:04:02.180> three<00:04:02.209> weeks<00:04:02.630> they're

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
class and then two three weeks they're

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.350 
class and then two three weeks they're
out<00:04:03.019> because<00:04:03.530> they're<00:04:03.980> not<00:04:04.400> catching<00:04:04.790> on<00:04:04.880> but

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
out because they're not catching on but

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.509 
out because they're not catching on but
it<00:04:05.480> takes<00:04:05.720> a<00:04:05.900> lot<00:04:06.079> of<00:04:06.110> practice<00:04:06.680> so<00:04:06.890> if<00:04:07.340> you

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
it takes a lot of practice so if you

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.180

really<00:04:07.880> want<00:04:08.120> to<00:04:08.239> learn<00:04:08.360> it<00:04:08.569> you<00:04:08.780> can<00:04:09.319> and<00:04:09.650> I
