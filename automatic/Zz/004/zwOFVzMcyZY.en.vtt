came to meet when I was very very
pregnant<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.590> I've<00:00:22.590> been<00:00:22.800> thinking<00:00:22.949> about

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
pregnant and I've been thinking about

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.220 
pregnant and I've been thinking about
after<00:00:23.730> having<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.090> baby<00:00:24.300> how<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.689> was<00:00:24.869> going<00:00:25.019> to
