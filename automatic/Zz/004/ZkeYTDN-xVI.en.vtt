00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 Welcome to your technology channel 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.240
 world to predict in today's world 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.690
 let's change the charging connector of 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.690
 your iphone 5 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.500
 Well here we have the iphone5 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.900
 we will start by removing the two screws 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.900
 from the back and we'll start 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.470
 we will pick up a suction cup we will stick it 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.380
 on the screen and with a spatula 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.660
 supported on the chassis of the mobile we will pull 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.040
 up until you separate the 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.040
 chassis screen 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.800
 then we will release the seven 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.379
 screws that hold the connector 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.390
 charge and the three that hold the connector 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.199
 of battery and the flex splices with the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.199
 charging connector 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.180
 now we will release the connector on the board 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.430
 base very carefully with the spatula 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.780
 It's a little corner pushing up 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.520
 only once loose and we will welcome and 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.660
 We will pull back until it is 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.660
 completely detached 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.799
 with the help of a screwdriver 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.600
 we will release the flex connector that we have 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.340
 here in front we will throw it back 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.340
 to start releasing the speaker 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.100
 with the screwdriver we will push the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.119
 speaker up we'll pull it back 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.119
 and we will take you out 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.410
 let's jump the wifi antenna cable 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.890
 carefully pull us up to 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.890
 break it 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.090
 for little by little we pull the connector 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.090
 back until it comes out 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.510
 we will remove the little piece that comes to the 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.510
 Jack connector side 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.460
 and we will remove the protective rubber from 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.460
 microphone 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.700
 now we will take the new piece and 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.640
 we will begin to put the cap of the 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.320
 side of the output jack connector and 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.320
 followed the protective rubber of the microphone 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.480
 we put the piece in its place 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.720
 you have to be careful that the microphone and 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.720
 the jack connector is well placed 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.989
 we put the speaker we put him first 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.079
 on the left side and little on 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.030
 little will fit we squeeze and now it's just 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.380
 place the screws to adjust it to 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.180
 chassis 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.040
 we will place the seven screws in the 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.180
 bottom part and all three of the part of 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.300
 above the charging connector of the 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.300
 drums 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.670
 we put the connector on the motherboard 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.269
 to put the badges 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.269
 protective 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.540
 now all that remains is to fit the screen of the 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.410
 chassis we will do it little by little for the 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.480
 corners 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.129
 after this we will put the screws 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.129
 from the back and you're done 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.260
