 yard to the pay zone but a 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.680
 good part of the match dream can be summed up 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.360
 by modest gains in patches 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.100
 first game on both sides and three 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.720

 teams for over 250 yards at the end 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.409

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.840
 Montreal 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.579
 everything, however, was played in the fourth 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.619
 quarter while the Sherbrooke tax 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:21.909
 led by Jeremiah Rock succeeded in 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.740
 enter a second touchdown by the 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.350
 beauty remains this time with the share 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.759
 of the rookie rookie isaac lauzon him 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.590
 also on a stroke of a yard 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.990
 the scoreboard then showed a 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.159
 advance of 16 12 bayard as the team 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.619
 Sherbrooke has managed to maintain 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.049
 until the final whistle no matter the go 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.940
 that it happens and it's wonderful the 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.740
 winner 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.110
 travel team gourmets of the 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.490
 lobbys pressure for me it's just 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.660
 to be patient of the caps does not have the 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.040
 big game at the right time as we did 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.360
 today things that we still have 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.160
 managed to do in our three defeats 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.540
 early in the season missed 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.040
 of opportunism today still been the 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.110
 If so I think here in losc and 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.670
 difference I think when I'm lying 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.530
 rea on has no inferiority complex 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.480
 so we know we can do it 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.740
 bios they know we can do that 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.990
 I do that it is that it gives 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.510
 exciting matches of 4.4 as it's 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.470
 always the case against the carabins 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.880
