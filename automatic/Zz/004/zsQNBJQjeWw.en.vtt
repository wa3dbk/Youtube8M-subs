I've<00:02:07.679> developed<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.250> simple<00:02:08.700> battery<00:02:08.849> box

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
I've developed is a simple battery box

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.510 
I've developed is a simple battery box
where<00:02:10.110> your<00:02:10.229> battery<00:02:10.349> is<00:02:10.560> connected<00:02:10.709> drill<00:02:11.489> a

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
of the way the next thing I want to talk

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.150 
of the way the next thing I want to talk
about<00:02:24.750> is<00:02:24.930> setting<00:02:25.050> up<00:02:25.200> your<00:02:25.260> transducer<00:02:25.830> for

about is setting up your transducer for

about is setting up your transducer for
years<00:02:26.340> I<00:02:26.519> went<00:02:26.610> with<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.849> internal<00:02:27.269> mount

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
years I went with the internal mount

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.600 
years I went with the internal mount
either<00:02:27.750> using<00:02:28.230> some<00:02:28.410> goop<00:02:28.680> like<00:02:29.250> sail<00:02:29.459> or

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
either using some goop like sail or

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
as accurate as they need to be I'll be

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
as accurate as they need to be I'll be
honest<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:40.980> tell<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.340> when<00:02:41.459> these

honest to tell you that when these

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.309 
honest to tell you that when these
external<00:02:41.940> transducer<00:02:42.599> mounts<00:02:42.840> came<00:02:42.989> out<00:02:43.170> I

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
external transducer mounts came out I

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.990 
external transducer mounts came out I
was<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.500> little<00:02:43.709> bit<00:02:43.830> skeptical<00:02:44.250> I<00:02:44.520> fish<00:02:44.849> in

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
was a little bit skeptical I fish in

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.870 
was a little bit skeptical I fish in
heavy<00:02:45.180> cover<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:46.200> lot<00:02:46.739> of<00:02:46.770> thickets<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.459> a<00:02:47.730> lot

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
heavy cover a lot of thickets and a lot

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.040 
heavy cover a lot of thickets and a lot
of<00:02:47.970> places<00:02:48.180> where<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.450> thought<00:02:48.630> this<00:02:48.780> thing<00:02:48.930> was

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
of places where I thought this thing was

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.540 
of places where I thought this thing was
going<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.230> become<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.530> hindrance<00:02:49.830> I've<00:02:50.400> been

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
going to become a hindrance I've been

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.190 
going to become a hindrance I've been
using<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:50.910> now<00:02:51.030> for<00:02:51.060> quite<00:02:51.390> a<00:02:51.450> while<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.870> it's

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
using it now for quite a while and it's

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.420 
using it now for quite a while and it's
not<00:02:52.350> as<00:02:52.440> big<00:02:52.590> of<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.770> problem<00:02:52.800> as<00:02:53.160> I<00:02:53.250> thought

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
not as big of a problem as I thought

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.760 
not as big of a problem as I thought
what<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.150> did<00:02:54.420> though<00:02:54.750> is<00:02:54.959> make<00:02:55.380> a<00:02:55.410> couple<00:02:55.650> of

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
what I did though is make a couple of

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.559 
what I did though is make a couple of
modifications<00:02:55.940> that<00:02:56.940> make<00:02:57.120> this<00:02:57.270> a<00:02:57.330> lot

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
modifications that make this a lot

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.510 
modifications that make this a lot
cleaner<00:02:57.870> for<00:02:58.260> fishing<00:02:58.590> in<00:02:58.739> those

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
cleaner for fishing in those

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.970 
cleaner for fishing in those
hard-to-reach<00:02:59.910> places<00:03:00.330> first<00:03:00.989> I<00:03:01.290> covered<00:03:01.860> my

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
hard-to-reach places first I covered my

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.890 
hard-to-reach places first I covered my
transducer<00:03:02.489> cable<00:03:02.640> with<00:03:03.269> some<00:03:03.420> industrial

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
transducer cable with some industrial

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.059 
transducer cable with some industrial
sized<00:03:04.080> heat<00:03:04.319> shrink<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:07.470> next<00:03:07.680> thing<00:03:07.800> I<00:03:07.890> did

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
sized heat shrink the next thing I did

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.580 
sized heat shrink the next thing I did
is<00:03:08.190> I<00:03:08.250> cut<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.580> bar<00:03:09.230> to<00:03:10.230> allow<00:03:10.380> it<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.500> be

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
is I cut the bar to allow it to be

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.830 
is I cut the bar to allow it to be
rotated<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.640> so<00:03:11.850> using<00:03:12.360> a<00:03:12.390> simple<00:03:12.720> thumb

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
rotated and so using a simple thumb

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.440 
rotated and so using a simple thumb
screw<00:03:13.640> so<00:03:14.640> that<00:03:14.670> when<00:03:14.880> I<00:03:14.910> needed<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.209> get<00:03:15.360> it

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
screw so that when I needed to get it

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.360 
screw so that when I needed to get it
all<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.660> way<00:03:15.780> I<00:03:15.959> can<00:03:16.200> rotate<00:03:16.350> it<00:03:16.530> up<00:03:16.769> and<00:03:16.950> bring

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
all the way I can rotate it up and bring

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.949 
all the way I can rotate it up and bring
it<00:03:17.400> around<00:03:17.549> and<00:03:17.910> store<00:03:18.360> it<00:03:18.480> so<00:03:18.630> that's<00:03:18.780> out<00:03:18.930> of

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
it around and store it so that's out of

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.509 
it around and store it so that's out of
the<00:03:19.080> way<00:03:19.230> when<00:03:19.620> I'm<00:03:19.739> in<00:03:19.860> shallow<00:03:20.069> water<00:03:20.340> or
