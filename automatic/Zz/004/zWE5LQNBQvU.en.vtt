things one is the pin code obviously and
the<00:00:27.330> other<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.840> what's<00:00:28.170> called<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.529> access

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
the other is what's called the access

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.859 
the other is what's called the access
point<00:00:29.340> name<00:00:29.550> which<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.090> name<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
point name which is the name of the the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.979 
point name which is the name of the the
router<00:00:31.710> in<00:00:32.040> your<00:00:32.460> mobile<00:00:33.059> operators<00:00:33.630> network

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989

internet so simply insert the modem into
the<00:00:39.750> room<00:00:40.050> here<00:00:40.290> one<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.129> two<00:00:41.309> USB<00:00:41.670> ports

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
the room here one of the two USB ports

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:52.220 
the room here one of the two USB ports
has<00:00:42.899> such<00:00:44.149> power<00:00:45.149> on<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.629> router<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:51.230> it's

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
has such power on the router and it's

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.700 
has such power on the router and it's
Yosi<00:00:53.870> few<00:00:54.870> lights<00:00:55.079> will<00:00:55.260> be<00:00:55.350> powering<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:56.010> and

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
Yosi few lights will be powering on and

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.639 
Yosi few lights will be powering on and
then<00:00:58.710> what<00:00:58.829> we<00:00:58.949> do<00:00:59.160> is<00:01:00.050> an<00:01:01.050> Ethernet<00:01:01.500> cable

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
then what we do is an Ethernet cable

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.590 
then what we do is an Ethernet cable
which<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.070> connected<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:02.820> computer<00:01:03.329> here

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
which is connected to this computer here

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.660 
which is connected to this computer here
will<00:01:04.409> plug<00:01:04.650> in<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.890> one<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.220> four<00:01:05.460> LAN

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
will plug in to one of the four LAN

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.370 
will plug in to one of the four LAN
ports<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.510> back<00:01:07.520> like<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:08.850> there<00:01:09.380> so

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
ports in the back like that in there so

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.050 
ports in the back like that in there so
you'll<00:01:10.530> see<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.920> third<00:01:11.280> LAN<00:01:11.549> light<00:01:11.820> is

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
you'll see the third LAN light is

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.749 
you'll see the third LAN light is
turning<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:13.049> or<00:01:13.799> has<00:01:13.920> turned<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:16.400> next<00:01:17.400> what<00:01:17.640> we

to something else obviously so push next
and<00:04:08.470> here<00:04:09.459> we<00:04:09.580> have<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:10.570> ability<00:04:10.959> to<00:04:10.990> encrypt

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
and here we have the ability to encrypt

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.330 
and here we have the ability to encrypt
our<00:04:11.950> wireless<00:04:12.459> LAN<00:04:12.700> transmission<00:04:13.570> so<00:04:13.810> that

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
our wireless LAN transmission so that

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.080 
our wireless LAN transmission so that
people<00:04:15.340> cannot<00:04:15.630> access<00:04:16.630> your<00:04:17.700> UMR<00:04:18.700> without

people cannot access your UMR without

people cannot access your UMR without
any<00:04:21.480> key<00:04:22.480> so<00:04:23.260> what<00:04:23.560> we<00:04:23.650> do<00:04:23.800> is<00:04:23.920> in<00:04:24.250> order<00:04:24.520> to

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
any key so what we do is in order to

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.210 
any key so what we do is in order to
encrypt<00:04:25.180> we<00:04:25.420> push<00:04:25.780> enable<00:04:26.230> encryption<00:04:26.380> and

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
encrypt we push enable encryption and

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.880 
encrypt we push enable encryption and
then<00:04:27.970> we<00:04:28.060> can<00:04:28.210> decide<00:04:28.540> on<00:04:28.750> which<00:04:28.900> strength<00:04:29.620> we

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
then we can decide on which strength we

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.210 
then we can decide on which strength we
use<00:04:30.100> on<00:04:30.460> the<00:04:30.580> encryption<00:04:31.030> so<00:04:31.270> if<00:04:31.360> you<00:04:31.450> choose

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
use on the encryption so if you choose

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.550 
use on the encryption so if you choose
128-bit<00:04:33.250> that<00:04:33.850> means<00:04:34.060> that<00:04:34.240> you<00:04:34.419> have<00:04:34.560> 13

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
128-bit that means that you have 13

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.140 
128-bit that means that you have 13
characters<00:04:35.919> you<00:04:36.280> gotta<00:04:36.460> fill<00:04:36.669> it<00:04:36.790> into<00:04:36.910> this

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
characters you gotta fill it into this

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.840 
characters you gotta fill it into this
key<00:04:37.450> space<00:04:37.750> here<00:04:38.110> and<00:04:38.800> if<00:04:38.919> you<00:04:39.040> use<00:04:39.160> 64-bit

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
key space here and if you use 64-bit

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.810 
key space here and if you use 64-bit
you're<00:04:40.600> gonna<00:04:40.780> have<00:04:40.900> up<00:04:41.470> to<00:04:41.740> 5<00:04:41.980> K<00:04:42.220> or<00:04:42.430> you<00:04:42.669> have

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
you're gonna have up to 5 K or you have

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.710 
you're gonna have up to 5 K or you have
to<00:04:42.910> have<00:04:43.030> 5<00:04:43.240> characters<00:04:43.750> in<00:04:44.020> there<00:04:44.740> so<00:04:45.340> put<00:04:45.720> 64

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
to have 5 characters in there so put 64

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:53.550 
to have 5 characters in there so put 64
bit<00:04:49.410> like<00:04:50.410> that<00:04:50.729> you<00:04:51.729> can<00:04:51.850> see<00:04:52.000> my<00:04:52.150> key<00:04:52.560> push

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560
