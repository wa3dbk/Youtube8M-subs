00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.870
 a camera mounted on the helmet of a 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.820
 firefighter can be more than the record of 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.620
 a striking image a material 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.049
 audiovisual that today also allows 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.970
 correct errors and provide valuable 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.470
 information but this help the most 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.390
 of the times comes from initiatives 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.580
 personal, because contrary to what 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.199
 that you could think the teams do not 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.199
 they are usually provided by the institution 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.750
 part 2 as a result of a documentary but we 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.860
 We realized over time 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.780
 that served us to be able 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.300
 to analyze our process of our 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.730
 procedures is an initiative that 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.800
 was born from the same volunteers the 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.960
 need to have some kind of 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.600
 record that would allow them to review and 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.170
 perfect your work in the combat of 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.170
 fires 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:22.890
 and this is the last record recorded by 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.800
 the volunteers of the first company 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.510
 of the fire department of santiago 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.910
 corresponds to the fire that affected a 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.530
 irregular textile workshop located in the 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.210
 sixth floor of a building in street 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.210
 conference at the central station 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.640
 how 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.840
 we go 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.110
 and procedures like this are crucial 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.329
 for perfecting work in 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.610
 this fire a woman died due 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:19.080
 to the desperation of being trapped 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:20.610
 took her to jump from the 14th floor all 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.370
 this material is revised later 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.319
 by the volunteers with their 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.080
 superior the task of us 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:31.349
 it was mainly forced entry 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.880
 and evacuation of civilians in 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.950
 usually with the videos we realized 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.870
 of the material that we have to 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.250
 take for that kind of emergency see 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.780
 a little the work that was done the 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.299
 security of communication that had 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.380
 at that minute so also again 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.049
 It served us well to make a 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.269
 analysis of sliding this practice is 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.730
 quite common abroad and in 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.860
 countries like usa all the 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.940
 procedures are recorded for 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.940
 its subsequent revision 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.760
 volunteers documents everything that is 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.750
 does not only because they have recording 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.099
 but also communications 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:11.220
 radio photography and in the 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:14.640
 pictures apart it shows a lot who 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.260
 what mistakes mistakes things that we 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.530
 we could have realized before 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.530
 get in 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.510
 but the practice of the first company 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.159
 is not unique in the 18th of vitacura 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.930
 cameras have become partly 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:35.530
 crucial to the training of 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.530
 volunteers 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.800
 not only for firefighting 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.709
 but more usual procedures 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.140
 like this gas leak caused by a 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.000
 backhoe are engraved for 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.760
 later review possible errors 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.670
 and teach the new firefighters about the 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.440
 emergency management serving us 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.750
 to perform the procedures that 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.790
 we are doing in the place of the 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.250
 scene in the place of the emergency and 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.319
 that we can review correct and 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.390
 consider not in forms or strategies 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.120
 of work in front of these emergencies 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.670
 that we have existed but like everything in 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.100
 firefighters every improvement every attempt by 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.769
 perfecting this work has costs 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.780
 for the volunteers themselves 150 thousand 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.820
 weights cost this camera is resistant to 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.520
 fire and specially designed water 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.720
 for the registration of these emergencies 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.090
 I've always liked the area 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.970
 audiovisual where the camera has given 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.400
 its fruits and that has allowed us to 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.419
 ability not and enter 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.669
 to everything that is the area of ​​analysis 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.410
 post fire own initiatives 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.870
 investment of the same volunteers 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.000
 intended solely to improve its 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.889
 work and so with the use of new 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.860
 technologies for the analysis of 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:53.820
 emergencies protect the life of everyone 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.820
 from us
