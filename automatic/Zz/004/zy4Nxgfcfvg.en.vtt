00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 
was telling her that I kind of like

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.379 
was telling her that I kind of like
figure<00:06:25.990> it<00:06:26.110> out<00:06:26.259> that<00:06:26.759> when<00:06:27.759> I<00:06:27.789> really<00:06:28.090> started

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:28.389 
figure it out that when I really started

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:29.969 
figure it out that when I really started
counting<00:06:28.630> how<00:06:28.870> often<00:06:29.199> I<00:06:29.259> say<00:06:29.410> horrible<00:06:29.770> things

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:29.979 
counting how often I say horrible things

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:32.550 
counting how often I say horrible things
to<00:06:30.370> myself<00:06:30.550> it's<00:06:30.970> so<00:06:31.449> much<00:06:32.050> more<00:06:32.289> than<00:06:32.350> I

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
to myself it's so much more than I

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.150 
to myself it's so much more than I
thought

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:42.220 

I<00:06:38.800> thought<00:06:39.800> it<00:06:39.980> was<00:06:40.100> like<00:06:40.220> once<00:06:40.520> per<00:06:41.330> twice<00:06:42.050> per

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:42.230 
I thought it was like once per twice per

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.500 
I thought it was like once per twice per
day<00:06:42.260> three<00:06:42.740> times<00:06:42.890> per<00:06:43.130> day<00:06:43.160> and<00:06:43.550> it's<00:06:44.360> like

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:44.510 
day three times per day and it's like

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.810 
day three times per day and it's like
once<00:06:44.750> a<00:06:44.870> minute<00:06:45.230> did<00:06:45.950> he<00:06:46.010> seem<00:06:46.250> like<00:06:46.280> he<00:06:46.520> was<00:06:46.730> in

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:46.820 
once a minute did he seem like he was in

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.500 
once a minute did he seem like he was in
a<00:06:46.850> lot<00:06:46.970> of<00:06:47.000> pain<00:06:47.270> like<00:06:48.940> my<00:06:49.940> husband<00:06:50.240> told<00:06:50.420> me

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:50.510 
a lot of pain like my husband told me

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.390 
a lot of pain like my husband told me
that<00:06:50.750> he<00:06:50.870> was<00:06:50.990> doing<00:06:51.200> very<00:06:51.230> well<00:06:51.500> that's<00:06:52.250> a

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 
that he was doing very well that's a

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.440 
that he was doing very well that's a
minute<00:06:53.890> let's<00:06:54.890> let's<00:06:55.460> be<00:06:55.700> generous<00:06:56.210> and<00:06:56.330> say
