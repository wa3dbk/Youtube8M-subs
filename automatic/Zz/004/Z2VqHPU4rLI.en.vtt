00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
battery life 24 hours for music and for

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.099 
battery life 24 hours for music and for
hours<00:00:19.529> for<00:00:19.560> video<00:00:20.070> from<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.000> thinnest<00:00:21.539> ipod

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
hours for video from the thinnest ipod

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.009 
hours for video from the thinnest ipod
we've<00:00:22.439> ever<00:00:22.769> made<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.789> think<00:00:24.480> that's<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.810> real

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
we've ever made I think that's a real

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.970 
we've ever made I think that's a real
accomplishment

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
accomplishment

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.519 
accomplishment
now<00:00:26.789> another<00:00:27.380> accomplishment<00:00:28.490> is<00:00:29.929> we<00:00:30.929> want<00:00:31.289> to

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
now another accomplishment is we want to

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.690 
now another accomplishment is we want to
be<00:00:32.840> just<00:00:33.840> really<00:00:34.829> environmentally<00:00:35.309> sensitive

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
be just really environmentally sensitive

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.819 
be just really environmentally sensitive
with<00:00:36.149> these<00:00:36.329> products<00:00:36.809> we<00:00:36.960> ship<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.320> lot<00:00:37.620> of

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
with these products we ship a lot of

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.889 
with these products we ship a lot of
them<00:00:38.010> we're<00:00:38.640> constantly<00:00:39.120> worried<00:00:39.780> about

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
them we're constantly worried about

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.990 
them we're constantly worried about
reducing<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.800> size<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.280> packaging<00:00:41.910> and

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
reducing the size of the packaging and

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.630 
reducing the size of the packaging and
the<00:00:42.120> transportation<00:00:42.989> carbon<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:44.190> we<00:00:44.340> spend

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
the transportation carbon that we spend

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.360 
the transportation carbon that we spend
and<00:00:44.820> move<00:00:44.940> these<00:00:45.090> around<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.539> world<00:00:45.809> but<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
and move these around the world but the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.279 
and move these around the world but the
biggest<00:00:48.149> thing<00:00:48.360> we<00:00:48.510> worry<00:00:48.780> about<00:00:48.870> are<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
biggest thing we worry about are the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.220 
biggest thing we worry about are the
toxics<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.190> we<00:00:51.030> have<00:00:51.360> an<00:00:51.690> environmental

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
toxics and we have an environmental

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.860 
toxics and we have an environmental
checklist<00:00:52.890> we<00:00:53.070> use<00:00:53.280> internally<00:00:53.870> on

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
checklist we use internally on

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.939 
checklist we use internally on
everything<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.879> I<00:00:56.879> have<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.719> say<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.800> new

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
everything and I have to say the new

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.979 
everything and I have to say the new
iPods<00:00:59.460> are<00:00:59.730> looking<00:01:00.030> great<00:01:00.300> from<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:00.750> point

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
iPods are looking great from this point

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.049 
iPods are looking great from this point
of<00:01:01.170> view<00:01:01.350> they're<00:01:01.980> arsenic-free<00:01:02.520> glass

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
of view they're arsenic-free glass

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.359 
of view they're arsenic-free glass
they're<00:01:04.049> BFR<00:01:04.650> free

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
they're BFR free

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.850 
they're BFR free
they're<00:01:06.030> completely<00:01:06.540> mercury<00:01:07.110> free<00:01:07.530> and

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
they're completely mercury free and

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.140 
they're completely mercury free and
they're<00:01:08.310> PVC<00:01:08.970> free<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:10.490> they're<00:01:11.490> highly

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
they're PVC free and they're highly

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.179 
they're PVC free and they're highly
recyclable<00:01:12.600> materials<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.560> aluminum<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
recyclable materials the aluminum of the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.960 
recyclable materials the aluminum of the
glass<00:01:14.479> highly<00:01:15.479> recyclable<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.759> we're<00:01:17.759> really

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
glass highly recyclable so we're really

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.910 
glass highly recyclable so we're really
trying<00:01:18.360> our<00:01:18.600> best<00:01:18.780> there's<00:01:19.170> more<00:01:19.470> we're<00:01:19.740> going

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
trying our best there's more we're going

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.520 
trying our best there's more we're going
to<00:01:20.009> do<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.430> future<00:01:20.610> but<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.330> far<00:01:21.600> we<00:01:22.500> think

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
to do in the future but so far we think

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.499 
to do in the future but so far we think
these<00:01:22.979> new<00:01:23.250> nanos<00:01:23.670> are<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.000> cleanest

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
these new nanos are the cleanest

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:34.779 
these new nanos are the cleanest
toxic-free<00:01:25.939> iPods<00:01:26.939> we've<00:01:27.240> ever<00:01:27.479> built

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.490 

now<00:01:35.789> there's<00:01:36.359> one<00:01:36.630> thing<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.960> haven't<00:01:37.140> really

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
now there's one thing I haven't really

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.349 
now there's one thing I haven't really
talked<00:01:37.770> about<00:01:38.100> with<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.369> new<00:01:38.399> nanos<00:01:38.909> which<00:01:39.179> we

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:39.359 
talked about with the new nanos which we

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:42.590 
talked about with the new nanos which we
call<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.810> nano<00:01:40.229> chromatic<00:01:40.859> they<00:01:41.759> come<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.299> some

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
call it nano chromatic they come in some

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.230 
call it nano chromatic they come in some
amazing<00:01:43.590> colors<00:01:44.039> the<00:01:44.250> best<00:01:44.490> colors<00:01:45.000> we've
