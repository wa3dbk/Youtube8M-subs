00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 welcome back warriors and this 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.730
 I'll bring a video a short time 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.980
 the time limit of the last one I posted 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.630
 that this one refers to the cartridges 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.270
 mega drive pirate 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.699
 because incredible as it may seem there are people 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.640
 even though he does not know the difference 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.939
 original for a pirate I leave there the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.330
 playing time had already 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.399
 knowledge and already knew 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.920
 each of the cartridges so let's see 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.399
 here for those who do not know I solved it 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.410
 make this request because of a 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.540
 comrade and a large channel games 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.230
 who were showing their 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.620
 collection said he did not know if the game 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.239
 I was crazy with what I can say I do not have 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.690
 simpler 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.329
 the alternative is not knowing if it was for him 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.940
 if they spared not but let's see here I 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:08.310
 I have some alternative cartridges here 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:09.780
 and also the alternative originals and 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.350
 cool 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.549
 Let's take a look okay, how can it be? 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.920
 seen here 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:22.380
 those are the alternatives they do not have 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.590
 no reference to the breeder or 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:30.060
 divesting caretaker of the original game 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:33.030
 only the name of the game and a more cover 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:39.799
 or less most pirate cartridges 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:45.149
 no screws on the back and 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:47.790
 all have the largest lip space 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:53.490
 the 1 centimeter and a half greater than the 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.990
 original larger horizontal but let's 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.340
 see inside 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.670
 most of the pirates have this ball 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.860
 here many people call it a 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.130
 black solder but this is silence 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:13.720
 which gives rise to the cei two cartridges 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:17.100
 originals and all pirates without exception 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.100
 comes in gray color 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.860
 from the contacts 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:27.630
 as they can see and also on the chip there is 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.370
 no reference from the distributor or 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:34.540
 the game developer and this is a 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:38.740
 original cartridge screw inlets 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.170
 is a tectoy produced in the free zone of 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:46.660
 manaus 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:50.950
 let's see the chip the chip has a serial 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.739
 on it you go the plate 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.310
 how can you see everything most or else 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:03.300
 all are red hot part of the 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:05.980
 contacts and will always have a serial here 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.110
 will identify the game if you do not 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.950
 know if you do not have a cover you're not 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:16.959
 working as I know it has here 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:20.440
 mpr 13 250 e means if I go 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.750
 Searching for this one is going to be the game. 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.750
 sonic 11 ok 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.920
 That's why I know how I feel. 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:32.590
 said wen 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:36.850
 the name of the game distributor blinds and 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:39.250
 where it was manufactured or half way only 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.910
 these small differences that make a 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.549
 original cartridge and the pirate 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.200
 it is the difference in functioning 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:50.670
 practically no difference 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.730
 although most cartridges 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.190
 Alternatives have some books 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:01.150
 mainly on the saw logo screen 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:05.560
 which usually get all pixelated time 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:08.560
 not to appear soon and in gameplay on 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.230
 game itself practically they stay 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.450
 normal there is no difference 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.090
 only that 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.060
 some cartridges do not pick up first 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.760
 have to fit on the right console 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.460
 Otherwise, it does not matter. 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.410
 also the useful life 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.790
 sure the original cartridges will 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.000
 last much longer 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.139
 if where are you still play with them already 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.050
 the Pirates 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.770
 generally have a very long life span. 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.130
 I enjoy 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.260
 the hamas also a difference of ipirÃ¡ of 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.200
 originals that do not always come with sc 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:46.590
 and that black ball is silence 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.800
 some pirates have ce and also if I 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:53.400
 catch a deadly kombat attack 3 has more 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:57.260
 I have here aa bec is a deadly kombat 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:01.700
 one's seeing 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:04.830
 he has been there but he is an alternative pirate and 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:07.919
 with the inscription that you can not tell the 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.180
 very sure that this is a little 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:14.160
 difference 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:19.110
 some cartridges sometimes come with cn 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:21.030
 to stain the ball of silence in case 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.310
 cartel suspect that this inspired 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.979
 It's not good I do not know I do not understand much 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.560
 electronics but god 2 I have one 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:32.700
 cartridge is all flashback that he 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:38.270
 I was 16 well the chip was over or 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:39.750
 less than this size of the balls and the 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.900
 miracle 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:46.710
 this cartridge even here still appears 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:50.490
 April already but will not blindly pro game nor 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.270
 dick just goes when what is there then 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.120
 games 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:57.150
 I hope you have prevented the way 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:02.490
 that I explained the difference of the 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:04.979
 alternative and original saucer cartridges 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.530
 I hope I have helped there if anyone still 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:09.510
 I had doubts I advise you were a 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.720
 the collector made more by 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:14.129
 Originals now if it's to play you. 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.830
 do not want to pay too much 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:18.839
 I also advise you to buy the 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.649
 alternatives that are well below the 

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:21.449
 Weight 

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:24.479
 despite having some sellers from there 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:27.749
 came the sale of very expensive cartridges 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:32.610
 I know I do not recommend buying 

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:34.529
 I will be from this unknown origin is this 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:37.429
 then I hope you enjoyed the video and 

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:37.429
 until the next
