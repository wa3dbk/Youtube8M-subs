00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
this so the packaging on this one also

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.330 
this so the packaging on this one also
features<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> picture<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.590> frosting<00:00:41.100> on<00:00:41.219> the

front<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.270> quite<00:00:42.540> basic<00:00:42.809> but<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.350> think<00:00:43.680> it

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
front it is quite basic but I think it

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.200

looks<00:00:43.950> pretty<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.489> would<00:00:44.640> go<00:00:44.670> with<00:00:44.969> any

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
room the pictures of the frosting kind

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.910 
room the pictures of the frosting kind
of<00:00:47.610> remind<00:00:48.000> me<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.149> baking<00:00:48.809> winter<00:00:49.260> with

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.400 
of remind me of baking winter with
friends<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.120> kitchen<00:00:51.329> with<00:00:51.840> family<00:00:52.379> I

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
friends and in the kitchen with family I

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.470 
friends and in the kitchen with family I
think<00:00:52.770> it's<00:00:52.890> really<00:00:53.070> neat<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.670> think<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.329> would

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
think it's really neat I think I would

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.330 
think it's really neat I think I would
have<00:00:54.570> loved<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.110> see<00:00:55.260> maybe<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.739> picture<00:00:56.190> of

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
have loved to see maybe a picture of

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.819 
have loved to see maybe a picture of
multiple<00:00:56.820> cupcakes<00:00:57.390> vanilla<00:00:57.719> ones<00:00:58.530> with

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
multiple cupcakes vanilla ones with

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.560 
multiple cupcakes vanilla ones with
buttercream<00:00:59.250> frosting<00:00:59.850> on<00:00:59.940> them<00:01:00.149> but<00:01:00.390> that's

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
buttercream frosting on them but that's

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.080 
buttercream frosting on them but that's
just<00:01:00.780> me<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.289> think<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.949> pitcher<00:01:02.280> overall<00:01:02.820> is

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
just me I think the pitcher overall is

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.719 
just me I think the pitcher overall is
alright<00:01:03.570> but<00:01:03.840> let's<00:01:04.589> get<00:01:04.920> on<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.280> candle

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
alright but let's get on to the candle

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.060 
alright but let's get on to the candle

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
reminds me very similar of like a

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.200

cupcake it has more of a light bakery
note<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.240> though<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:15.720> more<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
note to it though it's more of the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.499 
note to it though it's more of the
buttercream<00:01:16.950> frosting<00:01:17.490> definitely<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.450> is

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
buttercream frosting definitely it is

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.170 
buttercream frosting definitely it is
quite<00:01:19.020> basic<00:01:19.290> there<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.130> no<00:01:20.310> real<00:01:20.520> depth<00:01:20.880> of

quite basic there is no real depth of
the<00:01:21.270> scandal<00:01:21.570> it's<00:01:22.200> like<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.560> one-note<00:01:23.070> candle

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549

the scandal it's like a one-note candle
which<00:01:23.759> isn't<00:01:24.210> necessarily<00:01:24.659> bad<00:01:25.380> because<00:01:25.650> some

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
which isn't necessarily bad because some

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.950

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
delivers on creating a really nice

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.130 
delivers on creating a really nice
waxpool<00:03:04.860> in<00:03:05.190> flames<00:03:05.610> and<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.720> flames<00:03:06.989> are

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140
