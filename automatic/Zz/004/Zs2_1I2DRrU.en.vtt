00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:15.670
 Apparently the production is carefully kun 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.670
 I have a little drunk a 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.050
 It is good 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.120
 Also 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.350
 Sagawa 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.800
 Anshiro 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.580
 Toward the manga warehouse 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.580
 I 'm going 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.789
 300 yen lottery once 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:37.559
 then 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:38.550
 I shop I have a little changed and turned down pretty price than when I went last time 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.680
 so 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:46.160
 Well depending on the card of what has been bought because there was a guy that is in about half the price 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.610
 It is the ice sea Line travel joint thing 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.660
 It is the minute 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.570
 Yes 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.579
 10 First 3 seconds of research 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:00.760
 This is also something 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:04.860
 If there is something other than a card in this, that jt's Ramos or something 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:07.390
 It was that mother complaints and such things were hit 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.270
 I had no victory for me- 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.270
 Yes 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.250
 Make a copper plate 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.460
 Here 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.120
 I'm in focus 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:23.190
 Yes it and sekusufable 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.190
 This hit with a 300 yen lottery 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:33.060
 After all fanny Stellui is r r the guy of the guy is the best? 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.509
 This too 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.509
 Ok 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:44.869
 It seems that 1023 is something like speed type but speed nurse 's power 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.869
 There is 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.990
 That's why the kick is over for a 300 yen lot 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.030
 And 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.030
 It's not in the statement of dye public videos 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.630
 First of all 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.710
 At first it is this 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.340
 Yes 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.239
 It is a dog 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.700
 There are a lot of fair cards that I use this piece and red cards 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:17.110
 Well I got in but is Tan 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.390
 I wonder if I can say that this is pretty red 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:24.430
 why 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:29.290
 Or say, even animals of TadashiShiro Do as Well once I'd thought is 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:33.430
 It was 250 people and I bought this for a moment 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:36.510
 I used it when it was placed before, but there are many pearls 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.520
 I was not using that 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.260
 After all it compares considerably with Shiro 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.810
 It's because the numbers are rising too 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.120
 Buy again 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.430
 I will try to put in Spain tied 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.120
 I'm waiting 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.210
 Yes 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:58.520
 That's it 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:03:02.720
 I do not know how active in the next version 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:06.560
 Well I'm out of that video now 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.860
 Rascal, who is releasing videos on youtube 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.540
 This is Lucks Carry 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.310
 It is like buying an intriguing player 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:20.310
 Ainu 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:23.430
 Suddenly after all players have been replaced or teams have changed 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.540
 It's interesting a and it 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.670
 I am inspired 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.500
 Tano 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.980
 Hey do not you probably about now 3500 yen 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.850
 I 'm a guy but 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.310
 It is Charlton Hey I bought this 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:43.520
 It was 800 yen water 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:49.310
 Current time 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:50.760
 That power tape after all was conversion effective, so it went up quite 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.960
 Youne Charlton 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.410
 I think that maybe 3000 South American Prefecture 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:02.360
 So it was just 1800 yen 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:03.860
 I think it's cheap and I bought a little and it 's fine without thinking about the next version 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.370
 is not it 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.370
 Yes 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:13.850
 I'm a little worried whether it can be used in the next version 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.270
 I bought it for the time being 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.270
 Yes 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:25.620
 I 'm feeling well tied up with Spain 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:30.479
 I do not take an enthusiastic trophy 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:35.690
 I'm taking this video on the 3rd of December now but the rest 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.690
 Because it is the fact that twice as what can go to conversion Kelly 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.070
 Stick to the end 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:45.460
 It seems that something else will come out 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:49.800
 Worst meb blind to Esther 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.190
 I hope to do my best so that this side comes out 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.750
 Yes 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.940
 It was overly junk a 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.030
 Continued 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.060
 Even all the way to check land 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.560
 Thank you very much 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.409
 Already two more times ah 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.020
 It is a pedigree 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:10.449
 This video is 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.449
 By the time you raise 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:18.230
 I have not been able to live in the qualification model twice 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.760
 So the video has not come up yet 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:24.140
 Only twice a month 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.140
 Two more remaining 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:30.840
 So that's right I've finished shooting two more times and editing is over . 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:34.420
 I think that is 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:37.020
 Thank you in advance because we will be up at any time 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.680
 Yes was Jukkuri Kun more 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.680
