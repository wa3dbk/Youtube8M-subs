 interest which does not reset momentum with 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.990
 over time and steady growth 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.910
 army fans borderlands 2 weapons 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.460
 which knocks the enemy in 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.769
 any level and difficulty level of it 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.839
 the elements pacify the great and for each 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.539
 he has his element 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.270
 raid bosses tremble mobs turn into 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.910
 dust is the king-cannon bears total collapse 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.400
 shock corrosion and a twinkle make 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.160
 by surprise and give a bummer desert 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:39.450
 the hawk is very cool today in the guide the best 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:42.210
 Lots of many good menus such cyanogen 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.850
 his find a world without oil such books 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.100
 greetings guys guys question 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.440
 desert hawk swing overwhelming 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.750
 most players so today guide 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.149
 the edge that suppresses all living things 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.430
 surely some of you absolutely 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.020
 clearly understand the mechanism of pharma well let's 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.359
 friends will be more attentive to the big 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.850
 they are also relatively new 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.830
 need accessible information not 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.960
 all represent how to farm unique 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.729
 quest weapons and those who represent 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.400
 may be at an impasse by ignorance 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.470
 simple truths so my task is to add 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.080
 all puzzles in one beautiful canvas 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.030
 tidy and succinctly deserted hawk 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.460
 is the only class instance 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.159
 unique loot which is awarded 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.650
 player for completing the story mission 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.600
 agree quite unusual because it 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.729
 privilege is exclusively lateral 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.829
 errands which also emphasizes 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.869
 individual status of the dominator among 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.720
 top gear and so coordinates 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.820
 getting this cis dlc captain 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.970
 Scarlett story mission oh 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.950
 or oops according to the original designation somewhere 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.600
 here most players have 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.000
 re-size problem 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.560
 passage after successfully completing it 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.990
 task and continue the story 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.420
 subsequent chapters you lose 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.250
 opportunity to get deserted again 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.619
 hawk for story quest oh 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.930
 sent to the list of completed 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.299
 let's immediately solve this problem as 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.189
 bring back the game provided 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.810
 democratic cancellation mechanism 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.030
 character plot progress 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.770
 taking advantage of which you are actually 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.300
 get a pass to all earlier 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.520
 completed chapters like 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.680
 the main line is still available addons 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.840
 for this, in the prosthesis selection menu 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.940
 activation window available modes 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.430
 just press a button and kai 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.770
 confirm the cleansing of history but the trouble 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.450
 not every if not all wish for 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.490
 one pawn on new and shake 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.860
 passage restoring everything 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.440
 gaming environment components ranging from 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.110
 locations ending raid bosses and npc 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.150
 dilema is solved in a couple of clicks necessary 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.790
 duplicate your hero through 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.040
 making copies but let's atxy raiser 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.170
 for example for this turn the game in 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.290
 taskbar who on the console you catch 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.090
 principle go to the root of the file folder 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:55.110
 saves admin my documents 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.240
 May games borderlands 2 by love games of 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.060
 data folder with an individual number and 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.170
 here all save files in their 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.420
 0001 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.700
 this is my killer i will duplicate it 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.620
 Be sure to edit the order number in 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.720
 the same folder can not take root elements 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.650
 with the same name your cap 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.900
 let's take 700 10 should be exactly 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.570
 four digits otherwise the game will not see the Persian 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.660
 and I put the last one to the rest 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.700
 heroes back at the borderlands 2 menu and 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.950
 re-clicking on the choice of character 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.900
 Observe pure clone water so 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.790
 way we can reset progress by 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.130
 second assassin saving progress 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.410
 the main pass them do and the captain 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.690
 Scarlett up to the job oh fuck 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.420
 desert hawk all the elements of the parameters 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.910
 and remove copies of time since rice 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.100
 then before the end of the pharma it will take two to three hours 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.220
 than essentially losing yourself tens of hours 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.470
 routine but before passing dlc with a view 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.130
 getting a hawk important involved such 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.680
 trick 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.560
 mining which is awarded for the quest will be 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.870
 the same level as the quest itself therefore 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.090
 for getting gun 8 above level 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.890
 it is necessary to start the passage with 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.170
 eighth level overpower 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.300
 for example if you perform the task on 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.910
 seventy second and then only apnut 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.459
 top plain digital peak job like 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.130
 and the barrel will still remain 70 second 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.230
 so I caught the first time and now you have 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.480
 there is an advantage but we are natural 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.040
 We want to get no alpha howitzer and 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.200
 of all the elements and preferably with 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.870
 attractive spots so for 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.860
 begin to slightly expand 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.250
 tackle games up to unlimited 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.110
 the number of attempts to surrender the task oh already 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.870
 being directly in front of the captain 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.440
 Scarlett fulfilled orders quit 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.440
 to main menu 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:42.599
 Next, turn off the application and 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:45.750
 we propagate the corresponding preservation 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:47.849
 Here we took 00 10 so uncomplicated by you 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.550
 subjected there creating unlimited tariff 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:53.490
 to obtain the desired in not splitting let 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.289
 it will be purely visual 5 units in order not to 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.240
 repeat the extra movements of the skopje 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:59.550
 paste enough to create a backup 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.530
 copies of these files in a separate folder on 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.229
 which we will replace the waste 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:10.020
 characters and the farm itself looks like 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:11.250
 way we deploy the game and choose 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.550
 clone from list 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:19.470
 and continue the game waiting for download 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:23.520
 the cards are good and now we pass the quest and 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:29.819
 look at the characteristics of the hawk if 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:32.550
 that's how it is not ok now go to the menu this 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:34.289
 switch to next char by 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.810
 analogies repeat the process until 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:40.909
 until Scarlett drives a good one 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:44.370
 spontaneous bird well for example now 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:46.530
 I dragged the gimbal do as 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.500
 it is said for a small place in the cache 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.180
 piece of iron or house of iron or shelter 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.759
 Well, do you know where the steel minx is 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.830
 buffer zone the easiest way is to score immediately 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:57.419
 4 slots storage and then logging in 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.030
 main character take off full 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:01.919
 kit in order to cover the need for 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.860
 spontaneous modifications with MMK they do not 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:07.050
 enough 30 proc itself clean barrel 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.310
 sadist his critic mortal him 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.289
 shooting bursts 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.539
 Pay attention primarily to 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:14.759
 parameters their maximum value 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:16.500
 next recharge rate 2 and 3 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:18.389
 plus sometimes there are variations with 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.190
 23 percent extra bonus 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:22.289
 recharge and firing speed 2 and 6 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.449
 here look at this value 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:26.669
 than they are closer to the above topics 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:28.289
 brutal your tsatska in general guys 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:30.419
