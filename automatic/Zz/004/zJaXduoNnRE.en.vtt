printed<00:01:50.159> too<00:01:50.310> because<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.640> haven't<00:01:50.880> really

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
printed too because I haven't really

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.910 
printed too because I haven't really
heard<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:52.049> know<00:01:52.170> either<00:01:52.350> way<00:01:52.619> if<00:01:52.740> anything

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
short pregnant or not so hopefully they

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.780 
short pregnant or not so hopefully they
don't<00:01:55.530> do<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:55.920> hate<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.549> when<00:01:56.670> they<00:01:56.729> do

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790
