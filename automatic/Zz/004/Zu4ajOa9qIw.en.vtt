00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.920
 Marion and welcome to my next weapons review this time around 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.219
 around the guer keng years 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:12.759
 so here's quite frank about the time because they rated it videos flowers though 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:16.070
 once New Muscle Tech distress and team deathmatch what cases that one 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.070
 the very different one must play for the individual Olic 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:22.009
 So, like the weapon has over 50 rounds 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:24.349
 and usually 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.619
 Again, she has a total of 44 that means she can still twice 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.399
 reload at that time altogether 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.370
 yes, to see her you could rightly have recoil and cecile fast 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.610
 Firing and is extremely difficult so only for comparison, the readers again 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:42.310
 on and when I call with Werner Camichel 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.030
 So she is really heavy and she loads quite slowly 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.540
 that has no real animation if they just optimally for displeasure 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.700
 Reski Not and your mood 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.320
 since Electra steam could rescind good days off 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.049
 yes, but I am "Tarim Me just as a camper weapon and just 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.900
 but then you have to have the team support you 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.600
 For example, here now remains that they are such positions defender Willi 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.510
 can reload for example can 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.180
 for years a really fix-up formal with the gun itself barely 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.630
 still has a chance 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.360
 otherwise it can practice here it must turn up long last year full 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.000
 follows 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.520
 Dany Heatley are 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.140
 which already pressed before 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.340
 and you can lose that bit of AndrÃ©'s content 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.810
 but always in between a few shows but in the ammunition otherwise it says 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:35.620
 Not 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.860
 but for me I have to say that I'm still good at tasting it in 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.160
 Regards that means 50% more ammunition and 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
 IT Magazine SC on machine guns Depfa 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.910
 and in order to have a magazine, there's more 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.620
 damage 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.860
 In order to achieve a good survival, the Lionel will do just that 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.860
 the more difficult 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.749
 yes everything is optimal 

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:03.579
 the mother becomes 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.579
 pressing that corner is really easy and fast too 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:11.879
 if you have the word be careful that it's over quickly and year after year 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.879
 Mother-in-law and clown 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:19.659
 and also because of the fast leadership she really needs to be happy 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.249
 about problems 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:24.249
 It's just Dell's long reverberation time, too, that actually works here 

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:26.109
 even if he 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.339
 For example, here you have to stay Alisch and actually quite well 

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:31.679
 think about it beforehand 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:32.739
 learn there 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.230
 to La Rioja if he prefers to drive with cars, for example, to pension or 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.459
 whether he picks up another weapon or something 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.360
 if the ammo life is not that big problem though that 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.959
 in the long term can be difficult 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.109
 Herbert Mettler like that 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.139
 because here 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:57.099
 Normally I would not want any more ammunition now 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:58.489
 you say so 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.930
 I would not have all the bonus he needed 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.329
 then the game will be 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.540
 the precision is not too high as Project you see 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:09.489
 that it is sufficient to apply the accident yet so long that Transnet 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.459
 Responding to fire is also nice because of the backlog it alone 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:14.379
 Not 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.189
 to recommend 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:20.290
 Next to Kemper positions, these are really the effects 

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:26.999
 are the boards but also quite fun and use in between, however 

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:27.649
 rather 

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:30.649
 then shortly thereafter not so that no 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:36.240
 I will personally 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.380
 as soon as it shot so it was 

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:43.290
 Usually not after four or five shots, but sometimes I do that too 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.689
 used that is like with the smoke 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:48.549
 and around 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:49.829
 who with him 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.009
 Vania 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:53.420
 there is no more ammunition then it is already 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.669
 difficult 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:57.249
 the whole thing too 

00:03:57.249 --> 00:04:00.649
 to keep it neat 

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:03.819
 yes of course just blessed with an opera 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.009
 even in the region as for example why every page now 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:10.799
 I want to drop some if you like it 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.340
 then I would recommend you with cars without running around somewhere and may 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.709
 and then to look for a reasonable place where each 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.269
 could be fighting 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.059
 which he will run between the ERC with 

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:26.099
 lawless playing it is extremely slow because everyone is trying to shoot 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.080
 and run 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.689
 for the same stay just take away 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:33.689
 in the open field makes no difference 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:36.249
 the blackboard is 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:38.660
 for courageous sport and play without need 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:44.060
 optimally pushed back at 7 064 but not so good for other swords 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.060
 is on 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.479
 yes that was pretty much all that is to the fermenting ring and to say for 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.400
 the short cut in between 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.020
 and I wanted to show myself security holes game that did 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.539
 nothing to do with the matter 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:01.009
 and yes I hope Visio has liked you next comes then 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.269
 one that I have with the team in the deathmatch games
