00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.370
 welcome to tractors us 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.170
 spain today are more accurate 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.790
 said close to Granada and the new ones 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.110
 mercedes benz glk to test 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.030
 and we have not just a 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.750
 Legage died like that and the strongest 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:19.450
 sharpest the gla 55 amg as meanwhile 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.310
 probably with a special look and wire 60 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.990
 ps under the hood as he drives 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.220
 we test the same and as always 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.220
 I wish you much fun 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.540
 with the performance chassis what the ak 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:48.489
 45 edition has been on board as standard 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.070
 he is really crisp so always lies 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.020
 in the bend and the ride comfort it was 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.820
 somewhat limited but you want it yes 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.320
 also sporty and here there are 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.730
 Just come back to why then 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.300
 let's go right gas a look 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.500
 as the 360 ​​ps from the two-liter 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.839
 feel turbo 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.670
 after all, the strongest two-liter turbo 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.670
 the world is still for the honor 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.720
 and then full throttle 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.810
 Now we were under a look 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.540
 the bonnet on the heart of the gla 45 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.580
 evening g the four-cylinder two-liter 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.010
 turbo engine is the strongest of its kind 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.100
 and, of course, as typical for amg 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:47.970
 the plaque of the mechanic he makes 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.860
 360 ps and 450 newton meters and so he 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.970
 the power on the ground gets when all 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.010
 four wheels driven 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.670
 The drive is identical to the monkey 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:59.150
 40 mg and in about 45 mg and gives each 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.150
 Lots of fun 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.430
 the gla 55 amg is really fun 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.140
 even in bad weather like 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.000
 today he gets his thanks to all-wheel drive 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.410
 force on the ground now but still has 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.330
 the question is rather a 540 ca 45 45 40 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.730
 That's probably a question of 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.080
 Taste but we can serve everyone 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.100
 case thumb lift has really fun 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.100
 made many thanks
