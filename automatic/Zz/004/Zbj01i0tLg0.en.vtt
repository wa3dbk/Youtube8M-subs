00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:09.309
 in this movie doberman training thieves 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:11.760
 ski walked on come on come on come on 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.760
 has gone 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:22.490
 this is the beginning of the class and this 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.460
 learning outcome for 1 lesson is not 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.739
 block the cameras very often young 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.809
 energetic dogs pull the leash and 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.210
 reach forward and have such a dog either 

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:33.950
 are teaching a team next to or working on 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.200
 so that it is generally in principle never 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.300
 didn't pull over but before you 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.500
 finally turn your dog into 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.239
 obedient robot 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.429
 use it it is natural 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.339
 desire to drive activity for 

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:48.530
 to teach her to tow a skier 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:50.510
 just go he hears a crunch but he 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.670
 now distracted by dogs well, just 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.579
 walk 15 meters there and then back 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.859
 if the dog bites the ski harness or 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.440
 leash or jump on the master then 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.440
 learning will be very 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.440
 problematic 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.900
 I 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.700
 when learning towing 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.130
 it is not recommended that anyone run 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.710
 ahead of the dog it is better to run beside her 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.370
 also do not abuse the fact that someone 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.480
 standing far ahead calling the dog to himself 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.880
 note that when excited 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.030
 the dog is jumping on a man trying 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.280
 bite the leash or jacket sleeve this 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.070
 Of course it strongly interferes with learning because 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.620
 that the excitement directs the behavior 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.510
 dogs are completely out of the way who 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.000
 we need almost artem cook at you 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.250
 the task is you dog just go 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.250
 the most important thing is not to let him bite 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.650
 a leash and don't let him jump on you and 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.200
 bite the skies as a last resort they are beating 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.060
 him this red leash but 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.310
 try to cope yourself in some way 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.830
 the moment when you can not bite no leash not 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.320
 skiing you do not get tired of it all, he 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.830
 just go ahead and here a little bit 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.960
 helping him skiing you must well 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.810
 translate this into tow so he 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.520
 not even that much 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.750
 we start to go and can not somewhere nearby 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.870
 these without before he actually walks he 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:26.570
 just can not walk 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:26.570
 go walk out of here 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.060
 look you go uphill it's not 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.770
 better in the ranks with this kind of training 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.410
 it is very important that everything happens 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.930
 imperceptibly in a natural way should be 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.239
 good sliding is desirable 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.310
 downhill or on flat ground by 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.470
 good this dog needed to be taught 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.569
 run forward on a tight leash over 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.850
 team forward but we have training 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.100
 accelerated method so that's about 15 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.650
 minutes there is such a clowning 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.900
 side of a familiar person dog 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.880
 naturally run much better however 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.680
 with this type of dog training they 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.170
 learn to carry you on their own without 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:13.110
 Relieve well on straight legs 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:18.730
 do not ride in the knees legs bend 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:20.620
 let's throw a big leash cut in 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.220
 him, embed him so that he just lo 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:27.819
 I understood that we do not bite the leash 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:32.489
 leash gets it right to run 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.489
 we go we go we go we go the period has gone 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:39.750
 they don't run far anyway 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.750
 just gonna bite 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.900
 package let 's go like this quietly under 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.590
 driving on it is not particularly 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.780
 accented 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.960
 only when he starts to pull in the beginning 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.660
 a little help if it turns out but 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:59.360
 period and now the beginning of something 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.790
 be obtained at the initial stage normal 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.010
 situation if the dog drags on 35 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.900
 meters it is very good not helping 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.060
 if something is confused take a dog 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:13.640
 so that artyom could get out go ahead 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:16.040
 let there let there sooner or later 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.579
 active energetic dog stretches 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.980
 10-15 meters and it comes to that 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.840
 actually want from her and she 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.180
 glad that there is a possibility 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.419
 run forward correct behavior for now 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.650
 relapses are not yet persistently possible 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.250
 attention switching resistance on 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.250
 village 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.460
 punch him so he doesn't bite 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.910
 try to force him down there 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.090
 a little downhill and then on 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:07.170
 even a little bit uphill try 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:09.710
 it is here to banish from yourself not 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.710
 block the camera 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:30.350
 these novice lamp just did not write these 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:32.890
 hair porn free rearrange 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.890
 excitement
