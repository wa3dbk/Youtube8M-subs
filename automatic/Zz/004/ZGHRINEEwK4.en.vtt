00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
and we'll jump and have a look at the

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.660 
and we'll jump and have a look at the
game<00:00:52.809> so<00:00:53.809> as<00:00:54.289> I<00:00:54.499> say<00:00:54.649> each<00:00:54.920> level<00:00:55.249> has<00:00:55.339> got

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
game so as I say each level has got

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.569 
game so as I say each level has got
three<00:00:55.909> stars<00:00:56.179> and<00:00:57.070> there<00:00:58.070> are<00:00:58.219> literally

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
three stars and there are literally

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.369 
three stars and there are literally
three<00:00:58.820> stars<00:00:59.149> in<00:00:59.359> each<00:00:59.600> round<00:00:59.899> and<00:01:00.109> if<00:01:00.320> you

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
three stars in each round and if you

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.110 
three stars in each round and if you
collect<00:01:00.589> each<00:01:01.010> one<00:01:01.190> of<00:01:01.280> them<00:01:01.399> you<00:01:01.640> get<00:01:01.789> a<00:01:01.850> star

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
collect each one of them you get a star

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.910 
collect each one of them you get a star
it's<00:01:02.390> not<00:01:02.569> based<00:01:02.780> on<00:01:02.989> time<00:01:03.260> or<00:01:03.530> anything<00:01:03.739> like

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
it's not based on time or anything like

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.920 
it's not based on time or anything like
that<00:01:03.980> so<00:01:04.220> there's<00:01:04.460> no<00:01:04.610> time<00:01:04.850> limit<00:01:05.030> so<00:01:05.780> you<00:01:05.840> can

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
that so there's no time limit so you can

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.510 
that so there's no time limit so you can
take<00:01:06.200> all<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:06.500> time<00:01:06.530> you<00:01:06.680> need<00:01:06.890> to<00:01:06.920> complete<00:01:07.490> a

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
take all the time you need to complete a

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.180 
take all the time you need to complete a
level<00:01:07.730> and<00:01:08.200> that<00:01:09.200> doesn't<00:01:09.620> discredit<00:01:10.040> you

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
level and that doesn't discredit you

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.000 
level and that doesn't discredit you
anything<00:01:10.909> so<00:01:11.780> there's<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:12.590> main<00:01:12.740> interface

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
anything so there's the main interface

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.040 
anything so there's the main interface
it'll<00:01:13.550> give<00:01:13.729> you<00:01:13.820> a<00:01:13.880> bit<00:01:14.150> of<00:01:14.180> tutorial<00:01:14.720> in<00:01:14.900> the

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
it'll give you a bit of tutorial in the

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.920 
it'll give you a bit of tutorial in the
initial<00:01:15.350> levels<00:01:15.680> on<00:01:15.830> how<00:01:15.950> to<00:01:16.010> play<00:01:16.310> and<00:01:17.210> sadly

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
initial levels on how to play and sadly

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.090 
initial levels on how to play and sadly
I<00:01:17.960> don't<00:01:18.050> think<00:01:18.230> there's<00:01:18.500> a<00:01:18.560> way<00:01:18.680> to<00:01:18.740> disable

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
I don't think there's a way to disable

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.250 
I don't think there's a way to disable
that<00:01:19.310> if<00:01:19.550> you<00:01:19.640> don't<00:01:19.790> want<00:01:19.940> it<00:01:20.060> or<00:01:20.960> if<00:01:21.110> you're

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
that if you don't want it or if you're

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.900 
that if you don't want it or if you're
playing<00:01:21.440> it<00:01:21.590> the<00:01:21.680> second<00:01:21.980> time<00:01:22.130> around<00:01:22.160> so

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
playing it the second time around so

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.240 
playing it the second time around so
that's<00:01:23.900> one<00:01:24.200> thing<00:01:24.350> that<00:01:24.530> could<00:01:24.620> be<00:01:24.680> improved

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
that's one thing that could be improved

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.430 
that's one thing that could be improved
you<00:01:25.670> can<00:01:25.850> skip<00:01:26.210> any<00:01:26.540> level<00:01:26.900> so<00:01:27.110> if<00:01:27.260> you're

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
you can skip any level so if you're

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.560 
you can skip any level so if you're
really<00:01:27.620> stuck<00:01:27.920> on<00:01:28.100> a<00:01:28.130> level<00:01:28.400> you<00:01:29.150> have<00:01:29.420> an

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
really stuck on a level you have an

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.780 
really stuck on a level you have an
option<00:01:29.870> to<00:01:29.900> skip<00:01:30.230> it<00:01:30.410> so<00:01:30.710> you<00:01:31.190> jump<00:01:31.460> onto<00:01:31.640> the

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
option to skip it so you jump onto the

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.160 
option to skip it so you jump onto the
next<00:01:31.970> one<00:01:32.060> so<00:01:32.360> that's<00:01:32.540> really<00:01:32.750> good<00:01:33.050> because

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
next one so that's really good because

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.020 
next one so that's really good because
at<00:01:33.800> times<00:01:34.010> you<00:01:34.130> play<00:01:34.310> a<00:01:34.400> game<00:01:34.640> where<00:01:34.910> you<00:01:35.000> just

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
at times you play a game where you just

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.520 
at times you play a game where you just
can't<00:01:35.330> get<00:01:35.540> through<00:01:35.720> a<00:01:35.780> level<00:01:35.960> and<00:01:36.200> you<00:01:36.320> just

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
can't get through a level and you just

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.140 
can't get through a level and you just
stuck<00:01:36.740> that<00:01:36.980> so

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
stuck that so

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.270 
stuck that so
that's<00:01:38.480> nice<00:01:38.720> to<00:01:38.840> have<00:01:38.990> so<00:01:39.740> the<00:01:39.770> idea<00:01:40.130> of<00:01:40.160> the

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
that's nice to have so the idea of the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.100 
that's nice to have so the idea of the
game<00:01:40.430> is<00:01:40.490> to<00:01:40.820> get<00:01:41.030> this<00:01:41.180> box<00:01:41.510> into<00:01:41.990> this

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
game is to get this box into this

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.490 
game is to get this box into this
location<00:01:42.560> here<00:01:42.710> and<00:01:43.390> you<00:01:44.390> use<00:01:44.600> various<00:01:44.990> belts

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
location here and you use various belts

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.210 
location here and you use various belts
and<00:01:46.900> it<00:01:47.900> can<00:01:48.110> control<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.560> movements<00:01:49.130> of

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
and it can control the movements of

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.500 
and it can control the movements of
these<00:01:49.400> pills<00:01:49.960> by<00:01:50.960> these<00:01:51.230> controls<00:01:51.770> here<00:01:52.040> so

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
these pills by these controls here so

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.580 
these pills by these controls here so
there<00:01:53.510> are<00:01:53.600> different<00:01:53.930> ones<00:01:54.080> so<00:01:54.260> this<00:01:54.380> one

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
there are different ones so this one

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.380 
there are different ones so this one
loves<00:01:54.800> you<00:01:54.890> to<00:01:55.040> switch<00:01:55.310> to<00:01:55.610> either<00:01:55.730> side<00:01:56.030> while

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
loves you to switch to either side while

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.920 
loves you to switch to either side while
that<00:01:56.660> one<00:01:56.900> loves<00:01:57.200> you<00:01:57.290> to<00:01:57.440> pause<00:01:57.710> or<00:01:58.390> just<00:01:59.390> go

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
that one loves you to pause or just go

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.410 
that one loves you to pause or just go
forward

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.990 

and<00:02:03.200> you<00:02:03.409> go<00:02:03.530> stay<00:02:03.770> on<00:02:03.800> that<00:02:04.100> for<00:02:04.159> like<00:02:04.970> a

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
and you go stay on that for like a

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.850 
and you go stay on that for like a
second<00:02:05.450> or<00:02:05.540> so<00:02:05.690> before<00:02:05.930> it<00:02:06.170> turns<00:02:06.409> green<00:02:06.620> and

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
second or so before it turns green and

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.240 
second or so before it turns green and
that's<00:02:07.670> when<00:02:07.940> you<00:02:08.300> complete<00:02:08.630> the<00:02:08.720> level<00:02:08.990> and

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
that's when you complete the level and

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.620 
that's when you complete the level and
depending<00:02:10.250> on<00:02:10.490> how<00:02:10.640> many<00:02:10.700> stars<00:02:11.120> you<00:02:11.240> get<00:02:11.480> in

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
depending on how many stars you get in

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.170 
depending on how many stars you get in
each<00:02:11.810> level<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.650> character<00:02:13.160> changes<00:02:13.610> as<00:02:13.970> well

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
each level the character changes as well

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.940 
each level the character changes as well
so<00:02:14.569> it's<00:02:14.780> got<00:02:14.900> a<00:02:14.930> sad<00:02:15.140> face<00:02:15.410> if<00:02:15.530> you<00:02:15.620> just<00:02:15.770> get

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
so it's got a sad face if you just get

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.800 
so it's got a sad face if you just get
one<00:02:16.130> star<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.610> if<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.209> fall<00:02:17.450> off<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.630> ledge

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
one star and if you fall off the ledge

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:29.199 
one star and if you fall off the ledge
you've<00:02:18.110> got<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:18.260> retry<00:02:19.120> so<00:02:20.410> if<00:02:21.410> you<00:02:21.620> just<00:02:21.890> go<00:02:28.209> so

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
you've got a retry so if you just go so

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.910 
you've got a retry so if you just go so
you<00:02:29.270> just<00:02:29.420> really<00:02:29.600> get<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.200> restart<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:30.890> level

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
you just really get to restart the level

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.820 
you just really get to restart the level
that<00:02:32.020> so<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.230> game<00:02:33.410> does<00:02:33.440> throw<00:02:33.770> you

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
that so the game does throw you

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.740 
that so the game does throw you
different<00:02:34.310> elements<00:02:34.760> unless<00:02:35.060> you've<00:02:35.540> got

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
different elements unless you've got

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.630 
different elements unless you've got
hazards<00:02:36.350> here<00:02:36.590> so<00:02:36.950> if<00:02:37.400> you<00:02:37.550> go<00:02:37.670> into<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:37.970> fire

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
hazards here so if you go into the fire

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.770 
hazards here so if you go into the fire
you<00:02:40.640> destroy<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.060> box<00:02:41.300> and<00:02:41.480> you<00:02:41.600> got<00:02:41.750> a

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
you destroy the box and you got a

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.199 
you destroy the box and you got a
restart<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:44.140> then<00:02:45.140> there<00:02:45.320> are<00:02:45.440> switches<00:02:46.209> that

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
restart and then there are switches that

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.550 
restart and then there are switches that
will<00:02:47.630> allow<00:02:47.810> you<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:48.080> jump<00:02:48.820> and<00:02:50.380> stages<00:02:51.380> you

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
will allow you to jump and stages you

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.229 
will allow you to jump and stages you
see<00:02:51.739> that<00:02:51.980> there<00:02:52.190> is<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:52.340> small<00:02:52.760> glow<00:02:53.090> around

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
see that there is a small glow around

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.090 
see that there is a small glow around
this<00:02:53.510> table<00:02:53.750> which<00:02:53.900> is<00:02:53.930> actually<00:02:54.380> a<00:02:54.410> timer<00:02:54.709> so

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
this table which is actually a timer so

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.460 
this table which is actually a timer so
you've<00:02:55.550> got<00:02:55.790> up<00:02:55.970> get<00:02:56.420> that<00:02:56.720> star<00:02:57.050> before<00:02:57.380> the

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
you've got up get that star before the

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.220 
you've got up get that star before the
time<00:02:57.680> runs<00:02:57.709> out<00:02:58.070> so<00:02:58.510> there<00:02:59.510> is<00:02:59.660> a<00:02:59.690> bit<00:02:59.930> of<00:03:00.019> time

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
time runs out so there is a bit of time

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.080 
time runs out so there is a bit of time
element<00:03:00.590> that<00:03:00.680> comes<00:03:00.950> into<00:03:01.160> stages<00:03:01.910> where

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
element that comes into stages where

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.860 
element that comes into stages where
you've<00:03:02.209> got<00:03:02.450> these<00:03:02.690> special<00:03:02.840> stars<00:03:03.410> and<00:03:04.870> there

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
you've got these special stars and there

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.780 
you've got these special stars and there
are<00:03:05.959> stages<00:03:06.230> where<00:03:06.650> you've<00:03:06.829> got<00:03:06.980> a<00:03:07.010> time<00:03:07.340> the

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
are stages where you've got a time the

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.270 
are stages where you've got a time the
movement<00:03:08.329> properly<00:03:08.840> so<00:03:09.140> then<00:03:09.530> you<00:03:09.920> want<00:03:10.190> to

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
movement properly so then you want to

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.770 
movement properly so then you want to
get<00:03:10.549> to<00:03:10.730> that<00:03:10.820> ledge<00:03:11.120> there<00:03:11.420> you've<00:03:11.630> got<00:03:11.660> a

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
get to that ledge there you've got a

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.420 
get to that ledge there you've got a
time<00:03:12.019> it<00:03:12.170> right<00:03:12.320> otherwise<00:03:12.500> you<00:03:13.010> just<00:03:13.040> fall

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
time it right otherwise you just fall

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.750 
time it right otherwise you just fall
off<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:13.730> ledge<00:03:13.940> so<00:03:18.400> that<00:03:19.400> was<00:03:19.519> a<00:03:19.549> great

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
off the ledge so that was a great

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.590 
off the ledge so that was a great
example<00:03:20.000> but<00:03:21.579> you<00:03:22.579> get<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:22.880> idea<00:03:23.209> of<00:03:23.269> how<00:03:23.390> it

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
example but you get the idea of how it

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.340 
example but you get the idea of how it
goes<00:03:25.030> so<00:03:26.030> this<00:03:26.150> is<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.660> second<00:03:27.019> group<00:03:27.140> of

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
goes so this is the second group of

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.590 
goes so this is the second group of
levels<00:03:27.739> where<00:03:28.010> you've<00:03:28.250> got<00:03:28.519> like<00:03:29.030> eyes<00:03:29.269> on

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
levels where you've got like eyes on

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.030 
levels where you've got like eyes on
these<00:03:29.780> panels<00:03:30.230> here<00:03:30.350> so<00:03:30.560> there's<00:03:30.769> no<00:03:30.829> friction

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
these panels here so there's no friction

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.130 
these panels here so there's no friction
there<00:03:31.519> so<00:03:31.760> you<00:03:31.820> just<00:03:31.910> slide<00:03:32.209> off<00:03:32.540> easily<00:03:32.930> on

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
there so you just slide off easily on

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.039 
there so you just slide off easily on
there<00:03:33.700> so<00:03:34.700> in<00:03:34.820> some<00:03:35.030> stages<00:03:35.480> you'll<00:03:35.630> find<00:03:35.900> that

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
there so in some stages you'll find that

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.870 
there so in some stages you'll find that
there<00:03:36.290> are<00:03:36.560> blocks<00:03:36.860> that<00:03:37.130> will<00:03:37.340> block<00:03:37.640> your

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
there are blocks that will block your

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.699 
there are blocks that will block your
path<00:03:37.910> so<00:03:38.780> in<00:03:38.870> this<00:03:38.989> case<00:03:39.200> if<00:03:39.320> you<00:03:39.380> want<00:03:39.440> to<00:03:39.590> get

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
path so in this case if you want to get

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.220 
path so in this case if you want to get
to<00:03:39.829> this<00:03:39.980> star<00:03:40.250> and<00:03:40.430> if<00:03:41.269> you<00:03:41.420> cure<00:03:41.810> this<00:03:42.019> way

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
to this star and if you cure this way

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.600 
to this star and if you cure this way
you<00:03:45.230> won't<00:03:45.500> be<00:03:45.650> able<00:03:45.829> to<00:03:45.920> pick<00:03:46.070> up<00:03:46.190> that<00:03:46.310> stuff

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
you won't be able to pick up that stuff

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.270 
you won't be able to pick up that stuff
so<00:03:47.360> you've<00:03:47.959> got<00:03:48.140> to<00:03:48.230> move<00:03:48.350> around<00:03:48.530> that<00:03:51.220> so<00:03:52.220> you

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
so you've got to move around that so you

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
so you've got to move around that so you
got<00:03:52.519> to<00:03:52.610> send<00:03:52.820> this<00:03:52.940> guy<00:03:53.150> here

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
got to send this guy here

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:02.400 
got to send this guy here
and<00:03:55.860> then<00:03:56.860> you<00:03:57.040> can<00:03:57.250> go<00:03:57.460> here<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:01.840> pick<00:04:02.170> up<00:04:02.290> the

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
and then you can go here and pick up the

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.740 
and then you can go here and pick up the
star<00:04:02.620> barway<00:04:02.980> and<00:04:03.310> there<00:04:04.030> are<00:04:04.150> stages<00:04:04.330> where

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
star barway and there are stages where

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.240 
star barway and there are stages where
you'll<00:04:04.870> find<00:04:05.170> that<00:04:05.380> the<00:04:05.560> blocks<00:04:05.800> can<00:04:05.950> be

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
you'll find that the blocks can be
