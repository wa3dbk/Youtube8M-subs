stretch not not a large one by any means
a<00:00:20.529> few<00:00:21.529> years<00:00:21.740> ago<00:00:21.859> about<00:00:21.980> this<00:00:23.349> fence

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
a few years ago about this fence

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.140 
a few years ago about this fence
stretcher<00:00:24.859> woven<00:00:25.189> wire<00:00:25.369> stretcher<00:00:25.939> and

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
stretcher woven wire stretcher and

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.230 
stretcher woven wire stretcher and
before<00:00:26.689> that<00:00:26.720> I<00:00:26.900> used<00:00:27.050> to<00:00:27.679> -<00:00:27.859> before<00:00:28.220> that<00:00:29.119> I

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
before that I used to - before that I

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.040 
before that I used to - before that I
drilled<00:00:29.509> holes<00:00:29.599> through<00:00:30.169> and<00:00:31.509> ran<00:00:32.509> some<00:00:32.750> bolts

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
drilled holes through and ran some bolts

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.990 
drilled holes through and ran some bolts
through<00:00:33.230> and<00:00:33.500> just<00:00:33.530> basically<00:00:34.400> squeeze<00:00:34.790> the

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
through and just basically squeeze the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.570 
through and just basically squeeze the
two<00:00:35.180> two<00:00:35.360> befores<00:00:35.750> on<00:00:36.079> in<00:00:36.860> between<00:00:37.040> the<00:00:37.370> wires

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:37.580 
two two befores on in between the wires

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.150 
two two befores on in between the wires
and<00:00:38.180> that<00:00:38.510> worked<00:00:38.780> pretty<00:00:39.440> good

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
and that worked pretty good

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
and that worked pretty good
this<00:00:41.290> does<00:00:42.290> not<00:00:42.470> seem<00:00:42.830> to<00:00:42.860> be<00:00:43.190> as<00:00:43.460> heavy-duty

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
this does not seem to be as heavy-duty

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.820 
this does not seem to be as heavy-duty
this<00:00:44.480> particular<00:00:44.900> one<00:00:45.020> I<00:00:45.050> bought<00:00:45.350> they<00:00:45.650> may

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
this particular one I bought they may

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.920 
this particular one I bought they may
certainly<00:00:46.190> make<00:00:46.430> one<00:00:46.700> but<00:00:47.330> it'll<00:00:47.450> do<00:00:47.570> the<00:00:47.600> job

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
certainly make one but it'll do the job

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.450 
certainly make one but it'll do the job
you<00:00:48.470> can<00:00:48.560> stretch<00:00:48.740> pretty<00:00:49.010> tight<00:00:49.190> with<00:00:49.340> this

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
you can stretch pretty tight with this

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.400 
you can stretch pretty tight with this
thing<00:00:49.670> and<00:00:49.850> it<00:00:49.970> is<00:00:50.390> a<00:00:50.840> little<00:00:51.140> bit<00:00:51.230> more

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
thing and it is a little bit more

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.100 
thing and it is a little bit more
convenient<00:00:51.830> than<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:53.330> two<00:00:53.510> -<00:00:53.720> perforce

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
convenient than the two - perforce

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.140 
convenient than the two - perforce
because<00:00:54.410> all<00:00:54.980> your<00:00:55.220> bolts<00:00:55.400> are<00:00:55.700> already<00:00:55.940> there

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
because all your bolts are already there

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.330 
because all your bolts are already there
all<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:56.750> holes<00:00:56.990> line<00:00:57.320> up<00:00:57.350> on<00:00:57.740> the<00:00:57.890> other<00:00:58.040> post

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
all the holes line up on the other post

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.160 
all the holes line up on the other post
so<00:00:59.000> and<00:00:59.360> this<00:00:59.540> this<00:00:59.900> little<00:01:00.620> that<00:01:01.250> helps<00:01:01.640> a<00:01:01.700> lot

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
so and this this little that helps a lot

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.990 
so and this this little that helps a lot
instead<00:01:03.170> of<00:01:03.260> using<00:01:03.410> a<00:01:03.620> ratchet<00:01:03.800> first<00:01:04.670> few

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
instead of using a ratchet first few

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.330 
instead of using a ratchet first few
times<00:01:05.180> I<00:01:05.449> did<00:01:05.479> it<00:01:05.780> I<00:01:05.930> used<00:01:06.530> a<00:01:06.650> ratchet<00:01:07.040> til<00:01:07.189> I

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
times I did it I used a ratchet til I

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.090 
times I did it I used a ratchet til I
got<00:01:07.520> smart<00:01:09.700> so<00:01:10.700> basically<00:01:11.179> I<00:01:11.799> can<00:01:12.799> do<00:01:12.950> this

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
got smart so basically I can do this

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:22.270 
got smart so basically I can do this
with<00:01:13.310> one<00:01:13.520> hand<00:01:19.479> lay<00:01:20.479> the<00:01:20.630> fence<00:01:20.890> in<00:01:21.890> the

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
with one hand lay the fence in the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.209 
with one hand lay the fence in the
stretcher<00:01:22.759> like<00:01:23.030> this<00:01:23.649> I'll<00:01:24.649> try<00:01:24.799> to<00:01:24.920> line<00:01:25.189> it

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:25.219 
stretcher like this I'll try to line it

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:28.179 
stretcher like this I'll try to line it
up<00:01:25.520> parallel<00:01:26.479> with<00:01:26.749> your<00:01:26.990> stays<00:01:27.590> these<00:01:27.950> this

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
up parallel with your stays these this

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:29.859 
up parallel with your stays these this
is<00:01:28.310> going<00:01:28.429> to<00:01:28.490> be<00:01:28.609> upright<00:01:29.149> when<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:29.479> fence<00:01:29.689> is

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
is going to be upright when the fence is

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.809 
is going to be upright when the fence is
standing<00:01:30.799> these<00:01:30.979> stays<00:01:31.280> are<00:01:31.520> going<00:01:31.640> to<00:01:31.700> be

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:31.819 
standing these stays are going to be

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:37.080 
standing these stays are going to be
upright<00:01:32.270> so<00:01:32.780> you<00:01:32.840> want<00:01:33.109> your<00:01:34.659> stretcher<00:01:35.659> to<00:01:36.289> be

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
upright so you want your stretcher to be

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.459 
upright so you want your stretcher to be
in<00:01:38.090> between<00:01:38.479> and<00:01:38.780> I<00:01:39.289> like<00:01:40.130> to<00:01:40.280> put<00:01:40.460> it<00:01:41.319> right<00:01:42.319> up

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:42.469 
in between and I like to put it right up

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:45.550 
in between and I like to put it right up
against<00:01:42.799> this<00:01:43.219> this<00:01:44.149> this<00:01:44.840> stay<00:01:45.139> where<00:01:45.439> it's

two feet away I'm about two feet away
from<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.269> post<00:03:24.920> so<00:03:25.920> I'm<00:03:26.010> hoping<00:03:26.430> since<00:03:27.000> I

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
from the post so I'm hoping since I

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.840 
from the post so I'm hoping since I
think<00:03:27.660> I've<00:03:27.810> got<00:03:27.989> that<00:03:28.140> laid<00:03:28.350> out<00:03:28.380> fairly<00:03:29.010> flat

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
think I've got that laid out fairly flat

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.970 
think I've got that laid out fairly flat
there's<00:03:30.150> not<00:03:30.299> too<00:03:30.480> many<00:03:30.630> not<00:03:31.470> too<00:03:31.590> much<00:03:31.739> slack

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
there's not too many not too much slack

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.280 
there's not too many not too much slack
in<00:03:32.190> it<00:03:32.220> I'm<00:03:32.640> hoping<00:03:33.000> that<00:03:33.269> as<00:03:33.420> I<00:03:33.540> pull<00:03:33.810> it<00:03:33.989> it'll

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
in it I'm hoping that as I pull it it'll

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.050 
in it I'm hoping that as I pull it it'll
start<00:03:34.470> getting<00:03:34.680> tight<00:03:35.010> about<00:03:35.250> right<00:03:35.730> there

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
start getting tight about right there

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.229 
start getting tight about right there
and<00:03:36.810> if<00:03:37.410> not<00:03:37.560> I'm<00:03:37.769> gonna<00:03:37.950> have<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.160> redo<00:03:38.489> that

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
and if not I'm gonna have to redo that

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.710 
and if not I'm gonna have to redo that
and<00:03:40.940> so<00:03:41.940> I'm<00:03:42.000> hoping<00:03:42.209> that's<00:03:42.329> about<00:03:42.540> right

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
and so I'm hoping that's about right

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.420 
and so I'm hoping that's about right
about<00:03:42.930> two<00:03:43.049> and<00:03:43.170> a<00:03:43.230> half<00:03:43.290> feet<00:03:43.590> actually<00:03:44.040> and

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
about two and a half feet actually and

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.340 
about two and a half feet actually and
we'll<00:03:44.579> see<00:03:44.760> I'll<00:03:45.390> show<00:03:45.450> you<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.930> stretching

pool post basically again I was pulling
from<00:04:49.570> the<00:04:49.750> tractor<00:04:50.169> but<00:04:50.820> this<00:04:51.820> is<00:04:52.000> the<00:04:52.300> wire<00:04:52.509> is

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
from the tractor but this is the wire is

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.999 
from the tractor but this is the wire is
now<00:04:52.930> being<00:04:53.199> pulled<00:04:55.110> the<00:04:56.110> wire<00:04:56.410> is<00:04:56.560> now<00:04:56.740> pulling

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:57.009 
now being pulled the wire is now pulling

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:00.900 
now being pulled the wire is now pulling
on<00:04:57.340> the<00:04:57.460> poopoo<00:04:59.580> wrap<00:05:00.580> the<00:05:00.699> wire<00:05:00.880> around

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
on the poopoo wrap the wire around

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.909 
on the poopoo wrap the wire around
through<00:05:01.419> two<00:05:01.599> or<00:05:01.660> three<00:05:01.780> times<00:05:02.050> and<00:05:02.289> you<00:05:02.740> can

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
through two or three times and you can

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.330 
through two or three times and you can
snug<00:05:03.340> it<00:05:03.490> up<00:05:03.580> by<00:05:03.849> twisting<00:05:04.449> the<00:05:04.539> wire<00:05:04.750> and<00:05:05.340> that

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
snug it up by twisting the wire and that

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.730 
snug it up by twisting the wire and that
looks<00:05:06.580> pretty<00:05:06.669> straight<00:05:07.320> even<00:05:08.320> though<00:05:08.440> I<00:05:08.470> was

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
looks pretty straight even though I was

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.070 
looks pretty straight even though I was
kind<00:05:08.979> of<00:05:09.009> pulling<00:05:09.449> downhill<00:05:10.449> because<00:05:10.659> the<00:05:10.960> way

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
kind of pulling downhill because the way

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.249 
kind of pulling downhill because the way
I<00:05:11.110> had<00:05:11.289> my<00:05:11.409> tractor<00:05:11.770> sitting<00:05:12.840> fence<00:05:13.840> is<00:05:14.020> pretty

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:14.259 
I had my tractor sitting fence is pretty

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:19.830 
I had my tractor sitting fence is pretty
tight<00:05:14.500> it's<00:05:14.800> time<00:05:15.039> to<00:05:15.190> take<00:05:15.400> off<00:05:16.620> the<00:05:18.840> the

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
tight it's time to take off the the

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:38.189 
tight it's time to take off the the
stretcher<00:05:34.560> again<00:05:35.560> the<00:05:35.740> bill<00:05:35.919> make<00:05:36.659> lot<00:05:37.659> faster

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 
stretcher again the bill make lot faster

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:56.930 
stretcher again the bill make lot faster
than<00:05:38.470> I<00:05:38.530> wreck

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.300 

so<00:05:57.570> there<00:05:57.840> you<00:05:57.870> have<00:05:57.990> it<00:05:59.220> wires<00:06:00.210> in<00:06:00.450> place

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
so there you have it wires in place

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:07.030 
so there you have it wires in place
obviously<00:06:02.310> I've<00:06:02.490> got<00:06:02.700> it<00:06:03.650> haven't<00:06:05.000> I<00:06:06.000> fixed<00:06:06.750> it

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:42.390 
mow it that's all right then but because

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.510 
mow it that's all right then but because
it's<00:06:42.540> getting<00:06:42.690> so<00:06:42.780> hot<00:06:42.920> but<00:06:43.920> they<00:06:44.100> have<00:06:44.310> not

even<00:06:45.680> this<00:06:46.680> is<00:06:46.830> a<00:06:46.890> hundred<00:06:47.220> and<00:06:47.310> fifty<00:06:47.640> I<00:06:47.850> think

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 
even this is a hundred and fifty I think

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.620 
even this is a hundred and fifty I think
by<00:06:48.480> fourteen<00:06:49.470> and<00:06:50.070> the<00:06:51.030> grass<00:06:51.240> is<00:06:51.270> just

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:51.630 
by fourteen and the grass is just

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.690 
by fourteen and the grass is just
growing<00:06:51.960> crazy<00:06:52.320> in<00:06:52.560> here<00:06:52.770> they<00:06:53.010> have<00:06:53.190> not<00:06:53.430> kept

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:53.700 
growing crazy in here they have not kept

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.460 
growing crazy in here they have not kept
up<00:06:53.730> with<00:06:53.910> grass<00:06:54.270> 17<00:06:54.750> chickens<00:06:55.110> and<00:06:55.230> a<00:06:55.290> rooster

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:55.470 
up with grass 17 chickens and a rooster

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.210 
up with grass 17 chickens and a rooster
I'm<00:06:55.830> a<00:06:55.920> little<00:06:56.820> surprised<00:06:57.380> I<00:06:58.380> think<00:06:58.860> it's

00:06:59.210 --> 00:06:59.220 
I'm a little surprised I think it's

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.340 
I'm a little surprised I think it's
cause<00:06:59.370> there's<00:06:59.640> compost<00:07:00.270> pile<00:07:00.570> in<00:07:00.780> here<00:07:01.080> and

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:01.350 
cause there's compost pile in here and

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:09.560 
cause there's compost pile in here and
because<00:07:02.150> my<00:07:07.310> compost<00:07:08.310> tea<00:07:08.670> basically<00:07:09.420> is

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:09.570 
because my compost tea basically is

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:13.160 
because my compost tea basically is
coming<00:07:09.900> off<00:07:10.050> of<00:07:10.080> this<00:07:10.700> back<00:07:11.700> to<00:07:11.850> Eden<00:07:12.150> and<00:07:12.570> and

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:13.170 
coming off of this back to Eden and and

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:14.990 
coming off of this back to Eden and and
flowing<00:07:13.620> this<00:07:13.710> way<00:07:13.770> this<00:07:14.100> is<00:07:14.160> the<00:07:14.430> way<00:07:14.550> my<00:07:14.730> land

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 
flowing this way this is the way my land

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.120 
flowing this way this is the way my land
slopes<00:07:15.360> so<00:07:15.660> I<00:07:16.080> think<00:07:16.320> it's<00:07:16.470> feeding<00:07:16.680> off<00:07:16.890> that

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:17.130 
slopes so I think it's feeding off that

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:18.770 
slopes so I think it's feeding off that
and<00:07:17.340> feeding<00:07:17.610> the<00:07:17.700> grass<00:07:17.880> keeping<00:07:18.630> the

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:18.780 
and feeding the grass keeping the

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.590 
and feeding the grass keeping the
keeping<00:07:19.740> the<00:07:19.770> chickens<00:07:20.160> and<00:07:20.430> grass<00:07:21.180> you

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:21.600 
keeping the chickens and grass you

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.270 
keeping the chickens and grass you
typically<00:07:22.050> they're<00:07:22.290> gonna<00:07:22.410> clean<00:07:22.740> off<00:07:22.890> a<00:07:22.920> spot

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 
typically they're gonna clean off a spot

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.480 
typically they're gonna clean off a spot
it's<00:07:23.550> gonna<00:07:23.700> be<00:07:23.850> bare<00:07:24.060> earth<00:07:24.330> scorched<00:07:25.260> earth

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:25.490 
it's gonna be bare earth scorched earth

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.660 
it's gonna be bare earth scorched earth
so<00:07:26.490> let<00:07:27.120> me<00:07:27.410> set<00:07:28.410> up<00:07:28.470> the<00:07:28.620> camera<00:07:28.950> for<00:07:29.190> a<00:07:29.220> tie

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:29.670 
so let me set up the camera for a tie

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.670 
so let me set up the camera for a tie
and<00:07:30.090> I'll<00:07:30.270> show<00:07:30.450> you<00:07:30.480> how<00:07:30.630> to<00:07:30.660> tie<00:07:30.900> the<00:07:31.200> fence
