00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:31.360 
and blend it it's gonna blend in and you
haven't<00:06:26.210> even<00:06:26.330> put<00:06:26.539> any<00:06:26.720> mascara<00:06:27.199> on<00:06:30.280> now<00:06:31.280> she

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 
haven't even put any mascara on now she

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.279 
haven't even put any mascara on now she
really<00:06:31.819> wanted<00:06:32.120> to<00:06:32.180> go<00:06:32.330> ultra<00:06:32.720> dramatic<00:06:33.169> we

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:33.289 
really wanted to go ultra dramatic we

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:36.249 
really wanted to go ultra dramatic we
could<00:06:33.440> do<00:06:33.770> her<00:06:33.919> under<00:06:34.690> under<00:06:35.690> her<00:06:35.810> eyes<00:06:35.990> as
