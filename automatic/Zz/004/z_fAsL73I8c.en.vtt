going<00:03:28.190> to<00:03:28.250> take<00:03:28.370> place<00:03:28.610> where<00:03:29.269> we<00:03:29.360> see<00:03:29.510> a<00:03:29.540> car

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
going to take place where we see a car

going to take place where we see a car
crash<00:03:30.380> now<00:03:31.340> I<00:03:31.579> don't<00:03:31.640> know<00:03:31.790> if<00:03:31.820> it<00:03:31.940> was

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
crash now I don't know if it was

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.970 
crash now I don't know if it was
intentional<00:03:32.209> or<00:03:32.750> not<00:03:32.870> maybe<00:03:33.079> I<00:03:33.200> think<00:03:33.769> it
