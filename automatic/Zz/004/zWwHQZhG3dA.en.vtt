00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.499 
our roots over the pyramid and then we
will<00:01:36.920> put<00:01:37.130> in<00:01:37.310> our<00:01:37.520> fresh<00:01:37.880> loose<00:01:38.840> potting<00:01:39.409> soil

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
will put in our fresh loose potting soil

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:46.990 
will put in our fresh loose potting soil
which<00:01:41.509> will<00:01:43.689> be<00:01:44.689> nice<00:01:44.899> and<00:01:44.960> loose<00:01:45.350> and<00:01:45.850> make<00:01:46.850> it

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
which will be nice and loose and make it

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.510 
which will be nice and loose and make it
easy<00:01:47.210> for<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.840> new<00:01:48.799> routes<00:01:49.100> to<00:01:49.399> get

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
easy for the new routes to get

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.210 
easy for the new routes to get
established<00:01:49.820> and<00:01:50.330> for<00:01:51.289> the<00:01:51.439> feeder<00:01:51.649> roots<00:01:51.950> to

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
established and for the feeder roots to

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.600 
established and for the feeder roots to
start<00:01:52.460> growing<00:01:52.789> off<00:01:52.970> of<00:01:53.750> those<00:01:54.049> large<00:01:55.360> prints

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
start growing off of those large prints

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.449 
start growing off of those large prints
so<00:01:58.610> we<00:01:58.880> will<00:01:59.030> fill<00:01:59.299> this<00:01:59.479> up<00:02:01.420> leaving<00:02:02.420> a<00:02:02.600> basin

00:02:03.449 --> 00:02:03.459 
so we will fill this up leaving a basin

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:06.730 
so we will fill this up leaving a basin
in<00:02:04.459> the<00:02:04.700> hole<00:02:04.909> so<00:02:04.940> that<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.569> water<00:02:05.750> will<00:02:06.409> stay

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
in the hole so that the water will stay

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.300 
in the hole so that the water will stay
in<00:02:06.979> when<00:02:07.280> we<00:02:07.310> water<00:02:07.610> it<00:02:07.729> it<00:02:08.360> will<00:02:08.600> not<00:02:08.780> just

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
in when we water it it will not just

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.400 
in when we water it it will not just
flow<00:02:10.310> out<00:02:10.850> over<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.420> basin<00:02:11.840> and<00:02:11.959> taking<00:02:12.290> our

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
flow out over the basin and taking our

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.250 
flow out over the basin and taking our
good<00:02:12.560> soil<00:02:12.830> away<00:02:14.260> now<00:02:15.260> in<00:02:15.470> California<00:02:16.130> the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
good soil away now in California the

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.620 
good soil away now in California the
grafted<00:02:18.260> roses<00:02:18.709> would<00:02:19.310> sometimes<00:02:19.819> be<00:02:19.940> planted

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.259 
grafted roses would sometimes be planted
with<00:02:20.780> me<00:02:20.959> but<00:02:21.170> Union<00:02:21.590> out<00:02:21.799> of<00:02:22.069> the<00:02:22.190> soil<00:02:22.370> but

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
with me but Union out of the soil but

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.460 
with me but Union out of the soil but
it's<00:02:23.450> no<00:02:24.110> way<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.400> planting<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.519> soil<00:02:26.290> so<00:02:27.290> then

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
it's no way to planting the soil so then

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.880 
it's no way to planting the soil so then
it<00:02:27.590> comes<00:02:27.799> and<00:02:28.130> comes<00:02:28.489> right<00:02:28.610> over<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:29.150> budget

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
it comes and comes right over the budget

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.259 
it comes and comes right over the budget
so<00:02:30.890> we're<00:02:31.100> going<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.400> plan<00:02:31.609> a<00:02:31.640> little<00:02:32.000> bit<00:02:32.090> more

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
so we're going to plan a little bit more

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.680 
so we're going to plan a little bit more
and<00:02:32.709> this<00:02:33.709> can<00:02:33.950> help<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.310> Rose<00:02:34.570> create<00:02:35.570> its

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
and this can help the Rose create its

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.289 
and this can help the Rose create its
own<00:02:35.810> roots<00:02:36.049> over<00:02:36.350> time<00:02:36.560> now<00:02:37.370> we<00:02:37.430> poke<00:02:37.820> this'll

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
own roots over time now we poke this'll

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.440 
own roots over time now we poke this'll
soil<00:02:38.840> really<00:02:39.590> well<00:02:39.850> because<00:02:40.850> we<00:02:41.150> want<00:02:41.359> that

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
soil really well because we want that

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.750 
soil really well because we want that
soil<00:02:41.840> packed<00:02:42.260> really<00:02:42.620> well<00:02:42.950> around<00:02:43.280> our<00:02:43.459> roots

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
soil packed really well around our roots

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.949 
soil packed really well around our roots
if<00:02:44.090> there<00:02:44.810> are<00:02:44.840> any<00:02:44.959> air<00:02:45.680> pockets<00:02:46.630> that<00:02:47.630> can

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
if there are any air pockets that can

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.670 
if there are any air pockets that can
cause<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.350> root<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:49.790> root<00:02:49.820> stock<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.329> grow

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
cause the root the root stock to grow

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.080 
cause the root the root stock to grow
then<00:02:51.680> we're<00:02:51.950> going<00:02:52.070> to<00:02:52.130> fill<00:02:52.340> in<00:02:52.549> with<00:02:52.760> some<00:02:52.970> of

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
then we're going to fill in with some of

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.120 
then we're going to fill in with some of
our<00:02:53.239> regular<00:02:53.959> soil<00:02:54.200> we've<00:02:54.470> dug<00:02:54.709> out<00:02:54.890> of<00:02:54.920> our

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
our regular soil we've dug out of our

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.800 
our regular soil we've dug out of our
garden<00:02:55.489> and<00:02:56.060> we'll<00:02:56.660> just<00:02:56.780> fill<00:02:57.109> this<00:02:57.590> basin<00:02:58.040> in

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.910 

but<00:03:01.470> still<00:03:01.800> leaving<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.489> nice<00:03:02.840> vase<00:03:03.840> in<00:03:04.080> here

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.740 

and<00:03:08.480> then<00:03:09.480> we<00:03:10.319> will<00:03:10.970> water<00:03:11.970> it<00:03:12.180> in<00:03:12.330> we've<00:03:12.569> added

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
and then we will water it in we've added

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.430 
and then we will water it in we've added
some<00:03:12.959> of<00:03:13.319> the<00:03:13.520> solution<00:03:14.520> to<00:03:14.640> our<00:03:14.819> water<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.510> we

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
some of the solution to our water and we

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.050 
some of the solution to our water and we
will<00:03:16.590> just<00:03:16.739> water<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.250> rose<00:03:17.459> in<00:03:17.700> really<00:03:18.030> well

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
will just water the rose in really well

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.600 
will just water the rose in really well
and<00:03:18.599> we<00:03:19.470> will<00:03:19.620> want<00:03:19.800> to<00:03:19.860> keep<00:03:20.069> the<00:03:20.220> soil<00:03:20.459> moist

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
and we will want to keep the soil moist

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.750 
and we will want to keep the soil moist
at<00:03:21.090> all<00:03:21.269> times<00:03:22.819> for<00:03:23.819> about<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:24.840> month<00:03:25.580> until<00:03:26.580> we
