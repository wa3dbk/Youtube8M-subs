00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.000
 Hi, I hope everyone is very well 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.920
 as always and I bring you two ideas 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.780
 super simple to print two 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.910
 T-shirts are two ideas that have 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.189
 worked to me are the ones that have better 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.900
 operated is to say you know that 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.940
 is doing a little fashion for the 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.940
 nineties to bring messages in the 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.699
 t-shirts and I've also seen a lot that 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.490
 they bring fruits and the truth is that they are more 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.470
 of casual fun and if you do not know how 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.350
 supposedly combine show as the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.420
 combine me as I would combine them like this 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.399
 we will see everything as does the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.739
 first thing we're going to need are 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.130
 Some molds are achieved letter 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.250
 in stationery also adhesive paper 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:50.309
 scissors an exact and a cardboard and good 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.280
 you can search for inspiration in many apps 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.469
 that exist today or just google 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.870
 and the first thing I'm going to do is place 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.230
 the cardboard and then the adhesive paper 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.329
 above and I was already cutting some 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.970
 letters to go forming the sentence that 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.940
 I want you simply place them on the 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.470
 adhesive paper and with the exact let's 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.409
 highlighting the whole part 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.840
 from the center 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.929
 and then we can remove the letter and 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.299
 we do this with each one is pretty 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:22.630
 easy you just have to have a little bit of 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.630
 patience 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:37.010
 Now what I'm going to do is place the 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.650
 cardboard inside the shirt 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.470
 or the shirt you have chosen and the 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.030
 we can extend a bit and then nothing 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.730
 more let's remove the back 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.150
 to the adhesive paper and let's go 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.730
 hitting on the shirt and this is going to help 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.180
 that it does not matter that we leave 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:59.780
 it matters that we have a good hand or 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:02.990
 good pulse as we paint the letter is going 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:07.690
 to look good and this is the fastest and 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.690
 easy just start painting it 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.420
 and we're going to let it dry 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:18.140
 24 hours minimum but I would recommend 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:22.120
 than about 48 to make it perfect and 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.120
 so it will not fall with the washings 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.150
 the next idea is the easiest one just 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.820
 I'm going to use a little red tone 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.100
 with a little bit of pink I'm going to 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.970
 mix in a small carton with the help of 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:57.840
 brush and I simply shaped a 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.120
 apple like watermelon but you can 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.060
 also use a potato and shape it 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.800
 of what you want and simply what 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.990
 put on the cartoncito and then you go 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.080
 hitting on the shirt 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.270
 and that's how we're left with how 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.120
 that the little watermelons I decided to make 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:19.690
 several once it dried up simply 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:23.260
 I made a line with a green color 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:26.910
 all around so you can see it 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.910
 go watching like a watermelon 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:34.250
 and then simply with black color 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.470
 I was putting it like the little seeds 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.680
 I really liked how it was 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.239
 I think it looks very cool and the best is 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.650
 that you can do the design that 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:48.049
 you prefer 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.049
 and it 's super easy 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.040
 ah 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:27.810
 wait for advice this video was super 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.610
 simple is very easy and the truth is 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.560
 that you always tell me that 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.779
 things do not go as cheap as 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.639
 I always say but the truth is that 

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:38.550
 you have to search also once you have 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:41.729
 the materials then to print I do not know 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.409
 plus 25 shirts if you want so to the 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.539
 the center line going out all the more 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:47.129
 economic and good I was already 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.080
 organizing with some videos of 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:51.029
 Back to school for next week 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.159
 is that subscribe to get you 

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:54.569
 all videos do not forget to follow me on 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:57.599
 social networks because if we can 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:05:01.310
 be a little more in touch and that 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:01.310
 it's all we see each other in the next
