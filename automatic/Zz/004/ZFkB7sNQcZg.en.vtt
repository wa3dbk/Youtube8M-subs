00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000 

I'm<00:00:11.000> kind<00:00:11.570> of<00:00:11.690> self-taught<00:00:12.260> in<00:00:12.440> a<00:00:12.590> lot<00:00:12.710> of<00:00:12.740> ways

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.010 
I'm kind of self-taught in a lot of ways

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.580 
I'm kind of self-taught in a lot of ways
so<00:00:13.040> I<00:00:13.430> just<00:00:13.790> tried<00:00:14.120> to<00:00:14.150> analyze<00:00:14.660> how<00:00:15.110> I<00:00:15.139> figured

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
so I just tried to analyze how I figured

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.349 
so I just tried to analyze how I figured
out<00:00:15.710> certain<00:00:16.039> things<00:00:16.159> and<00:00:16.789> of<00:00:16.970> course<00:00:17.210> there's

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359 
out certain things and of course there's

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:18.790 
out certain things and of course there's
a<00:00:17.419> lot<00:00:17.539> of<00:00:17.689> things<00:00:17.869> I<00:00:17.990> haven't<00:00:18.259> figured<00:00:18.409> out<00:00:18.650> at

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
a lot of things I haven't figured out at

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.560 
a lot of things I haven't figured out at
all<00:00:18.949> but<00:00:19.189> I<00:00:19.249> was<00:00:19.279> just<00:00:19.400> trying<00:00:19.699> to<00:00:19.849> analyze<00:00:20.300> it

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
all but I was just trying to analyze it

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.630 
all but I was just trying to analyze it
and<00:00:20.810> part<00:00:21.199> of<00:00:21.289> that<00:00:21.380> is<00:00:21.589> also<00:00:21.710> because<00:00:22.400> as<00:00:22.550> a

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
and part of that is also because as a

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.120 
and part of that is also because as a
teacher<00:00:22.909> I<00:00:23.419> like<00:00:23.630> to<00:00:23.779> encourage<00:00:24.319> my<00:00:24.679> students

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
teacher I like to encourage my students

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.729 
teacher I like to encourage my students
to<00:00:25.519> explore<00:00:25.999> their<00:00:26.210> own<00:00:26.239> past<00:00:26.749> and<00:00:27.259> explore

00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:27.739 
to explore their own past and explore

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:29.889 
to explore their own past and explore
the<00:00:28.130> things<00:00:28.399> that<00:00:28.609> shape<00:00:28.909> them<00:00:29.210> and<00:00:29.419> then<00:00:29.810> I

00:00:29.889 --> 00:00:29.899 
the things that shape them and then I

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:31.899 
the things that shape them and then I
think<00:00:30.109> from<00:00:30.349> there<00:00:30.560> you<00:00:30.800> can<00:00:31.009> use<00:00:31.279> that<00:00:31.489> kind

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:31.909 
think from there you can use that kind

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:34.450 
think from there you can use that kind
of<00:00:31.970> as<00:00:32.149> raw<00:00:32.419> material<00:00:33.079> for<00:00:33.410> whatever<00:00:33.949> you<00:00:34.280> want

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
of as raw material for whatever you want

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.310 
of as raw material for whatever you want
to<00:00:34.609> explore<00:00:35.059> and<00:00:35.420> I<00:00:35.539> don't<00:00:35.600> think<00:00:35.840> anyone

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
to explore and I don't think anyone

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.840 
to explore and I don't think anyone
should<00:00:36.350> be<00:00:36.500> ashamed<00:00:36.680> of<00:00:37.160> where<00:00:37.460> they<00:00:37.640> came

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
should be ashamed of where they came

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.790 
should be ashamed of where they came
from<00:00:37.910> or<00:00:38.570> the<00:00:38.780> things<00:00:39.140> that<00:00:39.320> aesthetically

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
from or the things that aesthetically

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.319 
from or the things that aesthetically
shaped<00:00:40.160> them<00:00:40.399> I<00:00:40.429> mean<00:00:40.609> in<00:00:40.730> my<00:00:40.879> case<00:00:41.120> it<00:00:41.300> was

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
shaped them I mean in my case it was

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.630 
shaped them I mean in my case it was
just<00:00:41.600> a<00:00:41.750> lot<00:00:41.960> of<00:00:41.989> Disney<00:00:42.679> comic<00:00:43.070> books<00:00:43.309> and

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
just a lot of Disney comic books and

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.180 
just a lot of Disney comic books and
cartoons<00:00:44.000> a<00:00:44.719> character<00:00:45.500> like<00:00:45.649> Felix<00:00:46.010> the<00:00:46.160> Cat

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
cartoons a character like Felix the Cat

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.799 
cartoons a character like Felix the Cat
is<00:00:46.579> really<00:00:46.879> interesting<00:00:47.449> because<00:00:47.539> it's

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
is really interesting because it's

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.200 
is really interesting because it's
there's<00:00:48.199> circles<00:00:48.679> squares<00:00:49.210> cylinders

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
there's circles squares cylinders

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.180 
there's circles squares cylinders
triangles<00:00:51.019> there's<00:00:51.289> actually<00:00:51.769> many

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
triangles there's actually many

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.099 
triangles there's actually many
different<00:00:52.309> shapes<00:00:52.940> going<00:00:53.390> on<00:00:53.539> that<00:00:53.899> come

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:54.109 
different shapes going on that come

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:56.200 
different shapes going on that come
together<00:00:54.289> and<00:00:54.589> form<00:00:54.920> one<00:00:55.429> idea<00:00:55.910> of<00:00:56.089> this

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
together and form one idea of this

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.270 
together and form one idea of this
character<00:00:56.749> and<00:00:56.780> I'm<00:00:57.050> really<00:00:57.260> interested<00:00:57.890> in

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
character and I'm really interested in

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.029 
character and I'm really interested in
how<00:00:58.640> really<00:00:59.239> simple<00:00:59.749> building<00:01:00.320> blocks<00:01:00.620> can

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
how really simple building blocks can

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.099 
how really simple building blocks can
create<00:01:01.460> something<00:01:02.089> like<00:01:02.120> a<00:01:02.539> character<00:01:02.960> that

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:03.109 
create something like a character that

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:04.000 
create something like a character that
comes<00:01:03.320> alive

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
comes alive

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.790 
comes alive
I<00:01:04.040> think<00:01:04.730> the<00:01:04.970> audience<00:01:05.180> for<00:01:06.050> this<00:01:06.140> book<00:01:06.410> could

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
I think the audience for this book could

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.370 
I think the audience for this book could
be<00:01:06.920> anybody<00:01:07.370> that<00:01:07.580> wants<00:01:08.180> to<00:01:08.360> make<00:01:08.810> anything

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
be anybody that wants to make anything

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.950 
be anybody that wants to make anything
any<00:01:09.680> kind<00:01:09.770> of<00:01:10.040> creative<00:01:10.400> project<00:01:10.970> I'm<00:01:11.600> sure

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
any kind of creative project I'm sure

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.750 
any kind of creative project I'm sure
people<00:01:12.200> will<00:01:12.500> look<00:01:12.650> at<00:01:12.830> my<00:01:12.950> drawing<00:01:13.250> style<00:01:13.580> and

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
people will look at my drawing style and

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.910 
people will look at my drawing style and
think<00:01:14.000> that's<00:01:14.300> pretty<00:01:14.600> simple<00:01:15.080> I<00:01:15.260> can<00:01:15.500> do<00:01:15.680> that

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
think that's pretty simple I can do that

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.010 
think that's pretty simple I can do that
and<00:01:16.190> actually<00:01:16.400> I<00:01:16.580> think<00:01:17.120> that's<00:01:17.510> good<00:01:17.780> that's

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
and actually I think that's good that's

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.380 
and actually I think that's good that's
what<00:01:18.200> I<00:01:18.230> want<00:01:18.500> people<00:01:18.740> to<00:01:19.370> say<00:01:19.580> hopefully

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
what I want people to say hopefully

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.840 
what I want people to say hopefully
it'll<00:01:20.510> just<00:01:20.570> inspire<00:01:21.170> someone<00:01:21.650> to<00:01:22.460> feel<00:01:22.670> like

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
it'll just inspire someone to feel like

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.610 
it'll just inspire someone to feel like
they<00:01:23.060> can<00:01:23.300> do<00:01:23.480> it<00:01:23.660> and<00:01:23.930> that<00:01:23.960> they<00:01:24.230> can<00:01:24.410> take

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
they can do it and that they can take

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.860 
they can do it and that they can take
whatever<00:01:25.070> limited<00:01:25.760> ability<00:01:26.210> or<00:01:26.450> limited

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
whatever limited ability or limited

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.020 
whatever limited ability or limited
means<00:01:27.170> even<00:01:27.860> just<00:01:28.040> using<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.550> cheapest

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
means even just using the cheapest

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.330 
means even just using the cheapest
materials<00:01:29.600> a<00:01:29.840> lot<00:01:30.260> of<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.440> things<00:01:31.040> that<00:01:31.220> are

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
materials a lot of the things that are

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.950 
materials a lot of the things that are
shown<00:01:31.730> in<00:01:31.760> the<00:01:32.000> book<00:01:32.180> are<00:01:32.420> made<00:01:32.720> with

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
shown in the book are made with

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.430 
shown in the book are made with
sometimes<00:01:33.680> with<00:01:33.740> just<00:01:34.130> kids<00:01:34.640> materials<00:01:35.480> part

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
sometimes with just kids materials part

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.530 
sometimes with just kids materials part
of<00:01:36.530> my<00:01:36.620> philosophy<00:01:37.250> is<00:01:37.430> hey<00:01:37.730> anybody<00:01:38.000> can<00:01:38.240> do

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
of my philosophy is hey anybody can do

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.600 
of my philosophy is hey anybody can do
this<00:01:38.720> you<00:01:38.960> just<00:01:38.990> have<00:01:39.320> to<00:01:39.650> do<00:01:39.800> it<00:01:39.980> I<00:01:40.160> think<00:01:40.490> the

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
this you just have to do it I think the

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.790 
this you just have to do it I think the
hardest<00:01:41.000> thing<00:01:41.360> for<00:01:41.390> most<00:01:41.960> people<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:42.650> myself

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
hardest thing for most people and myself

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.250 
hardest thing for most people and myself
included<00:01:43.220> is<00:01:43.700> simply<00:01:44.270> getting<00:01:44.570> started

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
included is simply getting started

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.710 
included is simply getting started
that's<00:01:46.010> my<00:01:46.220> hope<00:01:46.460> really<00:01:46.490> is<00:01:46.880> that<00:01:47.180> people

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
that's my hope really is that people

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.940 
that's my hope really is that people
might<00:01:47.900> look<00:01:48.050> through<00:01:48.320> it<00:01:48.470> and<00:01:48.620> just<00:01:48.650> feel

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
might look through it and just feel

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.920 
might look through it and just feel
inspired<00:01:49.340> to<00:01:49.730> make<00:01:50.000> something<00:01:50.480> of<00:01:50.600> their<00:01:50.780> own
