basketball video games in the past

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.320 
basketball video games in the past
you've<00:00:08.860> been<00:00:08.980> the<00:00:09.070> passenger<00:00:09.580> pressing

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.330 
you've been the passenger pressing

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.480 
you've been the passenger pressing
buttons<00:00:10.660> and<00:00:10.900> waiting<00:00:11.650> to<00:00:11.740> see<00:00:11.920> what<00:00:12.100> happens

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.490 
buttons and waiting to see what happens

with<00:00:13.299> NBA<00:00:13.629> elite<00:00:13.930> 11<00:00:14.340> you're<00:00:15.340> the<00:00:15.490> driver<00:00:15.700> so

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 
with NBA elite 11 you're the driver so

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.270 
with NBA elite 11 you're the driver so
we<00:00:16.750> have<00:00:16.840> two<00:00:17.050> technologies<00:00:17.260> that<00:00:17.890> make<00:00:18.100> this

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:18.280 
we have two technologies that make this

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.760 
we have two technologies that make this
possible<00:00:18.580> our<00:00:19.360> animation<00:00:19.869> tool<00:00:20.110> kit<00:00:20.410> we<00:00:20.590> call

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
possible our animation tool kit we call

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.340 
possible our animation tool kit we call
aunt<00:00:21.040> it's<00:00:21.700> allowed<00:00:22.000> us<00:00:22.030> to<00:00:22.150> create<00:00:22.350> award

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350 
aunt it's allowed us to create award

want to make you know I know character

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.020 
want to make you know I know character
is<00:01:08.500> gonna<00:01:08.680> make<00:01:08.829> an<00:01:09.100> NBA<00:01:09.460> game<00:01:09.579> there's<00:01:09.909> so

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
is gonna make an NBA game there's so

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.639 
is gonna make an NBA game there's so
much<00:01:10.180> going<00:01:10.420> on<00:01:10.659> it's<00:01:10.869> a<00:01:11.079> lot<00:01:11.259> more<00:01:11.409> the

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
much going on it's a lot more the

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:13.469 
much going on it's a lot more the
variables<00:01:12.070> involved<00:01:12.700> in<00:01:12.969> making<00:01:13.180> it<00:01:13.390> a<00:01:13.450> great

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
variables involved in making it a great

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.440 
variables involved in making it a great
game<00:01:13.869> you'll<00:01:14.409> get<00:01:14.590> those<00:01:14.860> unexpected<00:01:15.850> moments

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
game you'll get those unexpected moments

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.420 
game you'll get those unexpected moments
where<00:01:16.750> a<00:01:17.049> player<00:01:17.320> sticks<00:01:17.680> his<00:01:17.770> arm<00:01:18.009> out<00:01:18.130> to

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
where a player sticks his arm out to

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.370 
where a player sticks his arm out to
block<00:01:18.640> a<00:01:18.670> pass<00:01:18.969> and<00:01:19.180> it<00:01:19.270> just<00:01:19.479> grazes<00:01:20.020> off<00:01:20.170> his

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
block a pass and it just grazes off his

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.260 
block a pass and it just grazes off his
finger<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:20.920> go<00:01:21.549> somewhere<00:01:21.939> that<00:01:21.969> you<00:01:22.149> weren't

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
finger and go somewhere that you weren't

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.660 
finger and go somewhere that you weren't
expecting<00:01:22.420> and<00:01:22.960> all<00:01:23.350> of<00:01:23.469> those<00:01:23.590> moments<00:01:23.979> we

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
expecting and all of those moments we

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.069 
expecting and all of those moments we
don't<00:01:24.909> know<00:01:25.119> when<00:01:25.390> they're<00:01:25.539> going<00:01:25.630> to<00:01:25.719> happen

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 
don't know when they're going to happen

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:27.719 
don't know when they're going to happen
it's<00:01:26.289> not<00:01:26.469> predetermined<00:01:27.189> like<00:01:27.310> it<00:01:27.430> was<00:01:27.579> in

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
it's not predetermined like it was in

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.399 
it's not predetermined like it was in
previous<00:01:28.090> games<00:01:28.270> we're<00:01:28.719> just<00:01:28.869> releasing

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
previous games we're just releasing

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.590 
previous games we're just releasing
things<00:01:29.619> to<00:01:29.799> physics<00:01:30.159> and<00:01:30.369> letting<00:01:31.240> physics

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
things to physics and letting physics

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.990 
things to physics and letting physics
help<00:01:31.750> so<00:01:32.350> that<00:01:32.530> means<00:01:32.799> you<00:01:33.280> know<00:01:33.369> balls<00:01:33.729> can

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
help so that means you know balls can

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.260 
help so that means you know balls can
get<00:01:34.149> tipped<00:01:34.450> in<00:01:34.630> any<00:01:34.810> direction<00:01:35.020> at<00:01:35.500> any<00:01:35.530> time

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
get tipped in any direction at any time

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.779 
get tipped in any direction at any time
and<00:01:37.270> you<00:01:37.600> create<00:01:37.899> a<00:01:37.930> lot<00:01:38.109> more<00:01:38.310> organic<00:01:39.310> moment

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
and you create a lot more organic moment

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:41.999 
and you create a lot more organic moment
of<00:01:39.939> players<00:01:40.810> going<00:01:41.140> up<00:01:41.229> for<00:01:41.380> rebounds<00:01:41.770> balls

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
of players going up for rebounds balls

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.810 
of players going up for rebounds balls
getting<00:01:42.250> knocked<00:01:42.520> loose<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:45.340> previous<00:01:45.789> years

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
getting knocked loose in previous years

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.080 
getting knocked loose in previous years
we<00:01:46.240> would<00:01:46.420> have<00:01:46.630> one<00:01:47.619> rebound<00:01:48.219> animation<00:01:48.880> that

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
we would have one rebound animation that

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.999 
we would have one rebound animation that
would<00:01:49.210> reach<00:01:49.390> up<00:01:49.630> and<00:01:49.840> maybe<00:01:50.200> one<00:01:50.560> that<00:01:50.859> would

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
would reach up and maybe one that would
