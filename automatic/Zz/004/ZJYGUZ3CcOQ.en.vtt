that's being rebuilt is the scripts and
that's<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:25.920> process<00:01:26.430> now<00:01:26.670> they<00:01:27.509> are<00:01:27.630> all

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
that's in process now they are all

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.090 
that's in process now they are all
available<00:01:28.340> rebuilt<00:01:29.340> or<00:01:29.549> not<00:01:29.729> rebuilt<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:31.100> we

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
available rebuilt or not rebuilt and we

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.380 
available rebuilt or not rebuilt and we
think<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.430> they're<00:01:32.700> all<00:01:32.729> basic<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.360> very

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
think that they're all basic and very

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.120 
think that they're all basic and very
sound<00:01:33.840> engines<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.470> as<00:01:34.560> much<00:01:34.770> as<00:01:34.799> that

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
sound engines and as much as that

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.810 
sound engines and as much as that
they're<00:01:35.909> all<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.180> 292<00:01:36.689> s<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.610> we've<00:01:38.610> done<00:01:38.759> a

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
they're all the 292 s and we've done a

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.569 
they're all the 292 s and we've done a
basic<00:01:39.240> inspection<00:01:39.780> on<00:01:39.930> all<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.229> them<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.579> we

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
basic inspection on all of them and we

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.859 
basic inspection on all of them and we
think<00:01:41.729> it's<00:01:41.909> going<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.119> be<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> really<00:01:42.630> neat

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
think it's going to be a really neat

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.600 
think it's going to be a really neat

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.740 
begin with so what we are doing is we
are<00:01:55.259> converting<00:01:55.680> them<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.130> either<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.880> modern
