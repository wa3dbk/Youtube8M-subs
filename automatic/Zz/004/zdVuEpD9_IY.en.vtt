[buzzer]

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.000
Turn around. You may never be up here again. Let's take a look.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.684
[Bob]: I don't believe it!

00:00:29.684 --> 00:00:33.000
Name an animal with three letters in its name. You said frog.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.800
Our survey said...zero.

00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:38.000
Two people would have to say that.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.250
Something found in a refrigerator. You said milk.

00:00:42.357 --> 00:00:46.000
Our survey said...twenty-eight.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
A brand of gasoline, we wanted.

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.166
You said regular. That's a good brand. Our survey said...[buzzer]

00:00:54.532 --> 00:00:56.065
[Bob]: That's the brand I use.

00:00:56.065 --> 00:01:00.448
Something that comes with a summer storm. You gave me THE answer.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.010
Snow.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.000
Our survey said...[buzzer]

00:01:06.937 --> 00:01:08.500
[Dawson]: I've got good news and bad news.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.649
Give me the bad news first.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.303
The bad news is you need a hundred and seventy-two points to win the money.

00:01:15.596 --> 00:01:17.810
The good news is you're the man to do it.

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.200
I'm going to ask you the same questions I asked the other Bob...

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:24.000
...you cannot and you do not want to duplicate his answers.

00:01:24.095 --> 00:01:26.500
If you do you hear this. [buzz buzz]

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.000
What noise do we hear? [buzz buzz] Thank you.

00:01:30.197 --> 00:01:33.044
I will then say "try again" and you'll give me another answer, all right?

00:01:33.132 --> 00:01:40.069
Remind everyone, to Bob's shame, the answers he gave us and give me twenty seconds on the clock., please.

00:01:40.328 --> 00:01:43.569
[Dawson]: Name an animal with three letters in its name.

00:01:43.754 --> 00:01:44.754
Alligator.

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:49.062
[Dawson]: Something found in a refrigerator.

00:01:49.057 --> 00:01:50.057
Milk.

00:01:50.057 --> 00:01:51.876
[buzz buzz] [Dawson]: Try again.

00:01:51.876 --> 00:01:53.476
Uhh, ice.

00:01:53.476 --> 00:01:55.400
[Dawson]: A brand of gasoline.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.534
Ethyl.

00:01:56.534 --> 00:01:59.500
[Dawson]: Something that comes with a summer storm.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.000
Umm, rain.

00:02:02.027 --> 00:02:04.169
[Dawson]: A sport with an All-Star Game.

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:05.362
[buzzer] Football.

00:02:05.362 --> 00:02:07.420
[Dawson]: Football! You've got to give him that!

00:02:12.452 --> 00:02:17.500
Any man that says "Alligator", you've got to...

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.673
Name an animal with three letters in its name, you said ALLIGATOR!

00:02:23.673 --> 00:02:26.602
Our survey said...

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
You don't use narcotics, do you, Bob?

00:02:39.714 --> 00:02:40.714
[Bob]: No, but I will.

00:02:40.714 --> 00:02:42.714
I mean, I thought "frog" was bad.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.888
I thought "frog" was a disastrous answer until you came up with "alligator."

00:02:54.888 --> 00:02:56.654
It was a real tough one, you know?

00:02:56.654 --> 00:03:00.000
"Dog" was the number one answer.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.829
[Bob]: I'm sure it was.

00:03:02.234 --> 00:03:07.557
Three letters in its name. Dog. D-O-G.

00:03:07.203 --> 00:03:08.500
[Bob]: Three of the same letter, you said.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.582
No, I said with three letters.

00:03:10.582 --> 00:03:16.000
Then we wanted something found in a refrigerator. You both had this nailed down very well.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.200
Unfortunately you repeated his answer, which was milk, but you said ice.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.355
That's the place to find it. Our survey said...seventeen.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.291
Milk was the number one answer, it was the only good thing that Bob did.

00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:36.810
A brand of gasoline we asked, you said Ethyl.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:37.810
[Bob]: A brand.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.000
[Dawson]: Right, which I think you've been drinking.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.500
Our survey said...zippo!

00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:47.167
The number one answer was Shell.

00:03:47.167 --> 00:03:50.700
Something that comes with a summer storm, at least you were reasonable...

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.800
...see his answer? Snow!

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.105
At least you said, I believe, "rain", is that correct?

00:03:57.105 --> 00:04:02.990
Well, that's good! Our survey said...nine.

00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:09.285
And then, a sport with an All-Star Game. You said football.

00:04:09.285 --> 00:04:12.478
It was about two minutes late but I insisted you get it.

00:04:12.478 --> 00:04:17.567
Our survey said... [buzzer] twenty-nine.

00:04:17.567 --> 00:04:20.043
Something, by the way that comes with a summer storm is lightning...

00:04:20.043 --> 00:04:22.600
...and baseball was the number one answer to our last question.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.000
Now, you have amassed, to my amazement, eighty-three points.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.200
[Bob]: That IS amazing.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:37.200
We'll give you five dollars for every point, a total of...four hundred and fifteen dollars!

00:04:38.075 --> 00:04:42.500
Please watch us tomorrow and see if he has the nerve to show up again, will you?

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.093
We love you, we'll see you here on "The Family Feud".
