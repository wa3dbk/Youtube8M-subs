the time or anything is what he's saying
what<00:03:33.239> I<00:03:33.270> said<00:03:33.390> in<00:03:34.670> even<00:03:35.670> if<00:03:35.760> he's<00:03:35.880> on<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.090> bench

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
what I said in even if he's on the bench

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.080 
what I said in even if he's on the bench
is<00:03:36.600> an<00:03:36.780> option<00:03:37.170> right<00:03:37.350> Andy<00:03:38.340> Carroll<00:03:38.610> wasn't

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
is an option right Andy Carroll wasn't

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.940 
is an option right Andy Carroll wasn't
Restless<00:03:40.050> wanting<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.530> leave<00:03:40.709> he<00:03:40.830> was

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
Restless wanting to leave he was

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.199 
Restless wanting to leave he was
prepared<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.340> stay<00:03:41.520> and<00:03:41.670> fight<00:03:41.820> for<00:03:41.970> his<00:03:42.090> place

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
prepared to stay and fight for his place

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.570 
prepared to stay and fight for his place
so<00:03:43.140> you<00:03:43.200> haven't<00:03:43.410> got<00:03:43.440> a<00:03:43.530> play<00:03:43.739> that's<00:03:43.950> unhappy

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
so you haven't got a play that's unhappy

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.710 
so you haven't got a play that's unhappy
right<00:03:45.770> my<00:03:46.770> point<00:03:47.040> was<00:03:47.310> Andy<00:03:48.090> Carroll's<00:03:48.480> being

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
right my point was Andy Carroll's being

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.229 
right my point was Andy Carroll's being
found<00:03:49.050> out<00:03:49.230> purely<00:03:49.830> because<00:03:49.950> of<00:03:50.100> money<00:03:50.459> not

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
found out purely because of money not

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.699 
found out purely because of money not
because<00:03:51.540> he's<00:03:51.720> doesn't<00:03:52.050> fit<00:03:52.260> into<00:03:52.500> the

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
because he's doesn't fit into the

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.979 
because he's doesn't fit into the
formation<00:03:53.100> our<00:03:53.430> system<00:03:53.910> which<00:03:54.180> okay<00:03:54.600> maybe<00:03:54.840> he

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
formation our system which okay maybe he

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.140 
formation our system which okay maybe he
doesn't<00:03:55.260> fit<00:03:55.530> into<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:56.430> system<00:03:56.880> that<00:03:57.030> he

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
doesn't fit into the system that he

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.490 
doesn't fit into the system that he
wants<00:03:57.360> to<00:03:57.420> play<00:03:57.510> but<00:03:57.690> that<00:03:57.720> wasn't<00:03:58.200> the<00:03:58.290> reason
