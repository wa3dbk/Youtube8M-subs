00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.070
 hello to everything so today I you 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.580
 proposes a new type of article form 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.370
 videos 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.590
 so we tested two products these are 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.630
 these two brand polish one of the 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.119
 varnish of natural origin we will see if 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.890
 the quality is really at the rendezvous 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.750
 here are the polishes a little closer so 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.570
 these are really pastel shades all 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.950
 the two we have the c 11 which is a 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.020
 which will be perfect for 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.620
 very natural manicures very light to 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.690
 carry and then the c0 4 which is 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.250
 rather a pale pink a little more 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.660
 pigmented as beige but who 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.000
 will easily agree with really 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.370
 all the outfits 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.079
 we look at the composition a little 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.030
 deal a real effort on that side we 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.190
 is about 80% of original ingredients 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.839
 natural which is really very rare 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.629
 in the middle of red polish it's a 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:57.760
 very appreciable effort then the 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.550
 practical side we do not think about it often 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.870
 but the top and completely square and 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.670
 it has a significant advantage 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.740
 that is when they are stored in 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.030
 a box you see directly the 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.140
 hue and you do not need to 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:13.960
 take out your complete bottle the brush 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.390
 important subject here it's well wide this 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.740
 which is perfect for applying it in one 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.740
 or two applications find that the 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.410
 covered just passing to 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.070
 the application so here I start with 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.380
 the Belgian 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.990
 it spreads very well the texture is neither 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.100
 too liquid or too creamy really 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.330
 the top 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.890
 with the wide brush is very 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.600
 practical for the principle I'm going when 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.790
 even put a second layer story 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.170
 that coverage is really ideal and 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.290
 we have no small defects on the right 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.290
 to the left 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.509
 that's the result on the complete hand 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.789
 you see them really lacquered and I 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.280
 have not worn top coat is going to 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.740
 roses here so here I apply them too 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.240
 very easily as for the first one the 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.840
 color and reliable from the first 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.390
 application 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.829
 it's true that we have a result that is 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.829
 even more reliable than on beige 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.530
 again I 'm going to put a second 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.140
 layer history to have the effect top coat 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.770
 long optimal hold and keep the 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:24.600
 optimal result for several days 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:26.550
 and here is the result on the hand so there 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.400
 the color no bad surprise 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.680
 really it's the same as the bottle and 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.640
 that's both hands so at the level of 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.470
 The clothe 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.640
 I knew how to keep his polish three days 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.980
 before he really starts to 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.410
 peel a little bit and the price you 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.950
 find them at 2 euros 90 each in 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.690
 trade 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.340
 do not hesitate to tell me in 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.410
 comment what color do you have 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.440
 favorite if the video you liked very 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.440
 quick
