few times to do a video showing my

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
lipstick um or maybe just my makeup

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.740 
lipstick um or maybe just my makeup
generally<00:00:13.769> but<00:00:14.009> i<00:00:14.280> mostly<00:00:14.849> wear<00:00:15.240> lipstick

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
generally but i mostly wear lipstick

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.359 
generally but i mostly wear lipstick
because<00:00:16.170> it's<00:00:16.500> my<00:00:16.680> favorite<00:00:16.710> kind<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.190> makeup

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
because it's my favorite kind of makeup

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.870 
because it's my favorite kind of makeup
so<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:18.210> gathered<00:00:18.779> um<00:00:20.150> the<00:00:21.150> lipsticks<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:22.170> were

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
so I gathered um the lipsticks that were

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.310 
so I gathered um the lipsticks that were
conveniently<00:00:23.880> around<00:00:24.240> me<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.810> was<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.019> lot

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
conveniently around me and it was a lot

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.370 
conveniently around me and it was a lot
so<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:26.699> figured<00:00:27.330> like<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.840> don't<00:00:27.900> really<00:00:28.080> need<00:00:28.260> to

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
so I figured like I don't really need to

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.620 
so I figured like I don't really need to
show<00:00:28.560> all<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.160> these<00:00:29.609> because<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.179> don't<00:00:30.390> wear<00:00:30.599> a

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
show all of these because I don't wear a

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.250 
show all of these because I don't wear a
lot<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.900> them<00:00:31.219> regularly<00:00:32.809> but<00:00:33.809> i<00:00:33.870> thought<00:00:34.050> i

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
lot of them regularly but i thought i

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.979 
lot of them regularly but i thought i

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
particular reason for that I just tend

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.170 
particular reason for that I just tend
to<00:03:10.980> do<00:03:11.069> it<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.280> guess<00:03:11.430> um<00:03:12.379> okay<00:03:13.379> what<00:03:13.560> else<00:03:14.180> so

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
to do it I guess um okay what else so

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.099 
to do it I guess um okay what else so
here's<00:03:15.569> my<00:03:15.690> orange<00:03:16.379> one<00:03:16.910> okay<00:03:17.910> so<00:03:17.970> it's<00:03:18.510> the

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
here's my orange one okay so it's the

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.030 
here's my orange one okay so it's the
labels<00:03:20.840> faded<00:03:21.840> away<00:03:21.930> but<00:03:22.680> I<00:03:22.709> think<00:03:22.889> it<00:03:22.950> was

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
labels faded away but I think it was

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.559 
labels faded away but I think it was
just<00:03:23.100> called<00:03:23.340> bright<00:03:23.579> orange<00:03:24.060> or<00:03:24.239> something

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
just called bright orange or something
