00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.550 
a great assault rifle to go with the
best<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.250> my<00:01:26.340> opinion<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:27.630> g11<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> very

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
best in my opinion the g11 is a very

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.890 
best in my opinion the g11 is a very
similar<00:01:29.189> gun<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> 3<00:01:30.180> verse<00:01:30.329> weapon<00:01:30.720> it

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
similar gun it is a 3 verse weapon it

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.710 
similar gun it is a 3 verse weapon it
has<00:01:31.020> more<00:01:31.259> ammo<00:01:31.680> but<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.549> my<00:01:32.909> honest<00:01:33.270> opinion

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
has more ammo but in my honest opinion

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.359 
has more ammo but in my honest opinion
without<00:01:33.950> attachments<00:01:34.950> on<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.220> weapon

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
without attachments on that weapon

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.190 
without attachments on that weapon
without<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:36.060> know<00:01:36.150> available<00:01:36.659> attachments

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
without you know available attachments

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.600 
without you know available attachments
like<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.409> red<00:01:37.560> dot<00:01:37.710> sight<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.189> reflex

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
like the red dot sight and the reflex

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.999 
like the red dot sight and the reflex
sight<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:39.090> don't<00:01:39.570> like<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.110> i<00:01:40.590> already<00:01:40.860> have

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
sight I don't like it and i already have

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.859 
sight I don't like it and i already have
used<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.369> quite<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.610> bit<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.479> i<00:01:42.570> would<00:01:42.750> not

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
used it quite a bit and i would not

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.660 
used it quite a bit and i would not
recommend<00:01:42.990> using<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:43.860> i<00:01:43.890> think<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.159> m16

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
recommend using that so i think the m16

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.789 
recommend using that so i think the m16
is<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.909> better<00:01:45.149> weapon<00:01:45.329> moving<00:01:46.290> down<00:01:46.439> on<00:01:46.710> the

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
is a better weapon moving down on the

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.100 
is a better weapon moving down on the
class<00:01:47.009> i<00:01:47.310> use<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.490> frag<00:01:47.850> grenade<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.540> m16

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
class i use a frag grenade on the m16

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.719 
class i use a frag grenade on the m16
because<00:01:49.470> as<00:01:49.619> i<00:01:49.740> just<00:01:49.799> mentioned<00:01:49.950> i<00:01:50.369> use<00:01:50.549> this

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
because as i just mentioned i use this

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.510 
because as i just mentioned i use this
in<00:01:50.970> long-range<00:01:51.299> situations<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:53.310> semtex

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
in long-range situations and the semtex

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.609 
in long-range situations and the semtex
just<00:01:53.939> doesn't<00:01:54.329> going<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.659> work<00:01:54.930> as<00:01:55.140> effective

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
just doesn't going to work as effective

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.709 
just doesn't going to work as effective
in<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.640> know<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.790> can't<00:01:57.240> throw<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.509> as<00:01:57.689> far

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
in you know you can't throw it as far

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.929 
in you know you can't throw it as far
and<00:01:58.229> have<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.829> not<00:01:58.950> explode<00:01:59.130> as<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.700> came<00:01:59.850> with

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
and have it not explode as you came with

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.850 
and have it not explode as you came with
a<00:02:00.060> frag<00:02:00.270> grenade<00:02:00.570> concussion<00:02:01.290> grenade<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.710> use

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
a frag grenade concussion grenade I use

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.319 
a frag grenade concussion grenade I use
those<00:02:02.040> across<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.369> board<00:02:02.759> they're<00:02:03.030> basically

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
those across the board they're basically

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.600 
those across the board they're basically
stun<00:02:03.750> grenades<00:02:04.049> if<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.290> didn't<00:02:04.500> know<00:02:04.560> already

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
stun grenades if you didn't know already

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.039 
stun grenades if you didn't know already
the<00:02:05.610> motion<00:02:05.939> sensor<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.299> find<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:06.780> more

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
the motion sensor I find this more

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.600 
the motion sensor I find this more
effective<00:02:07.409> than<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.680> Claymore<00:02:08.190> which<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.459> was

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
effective than the Claymore which I was

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.580 
effective than the Claymore which I was
originally<00:02:08.910> using<00:02:09.509> basically<00:02:10.050> in<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.289> motion

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
originally using basically in the motion

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.110 
originally using basically in the motion
sensor<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:11.069> set<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.340> down<00:02:11.459> on<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.700> map<00:02:11.910> and

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
sensor you set it down on the map and

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.940 
sensor you set it down on the map and
it's<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.599> mini<00:02:12.840> UAV<00:02:13.349> it<00:02:13.590> sends

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
it's a mini UAV it sends

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.040 
it's a mini UAV it sends
this<00:02:14.129> little<00:02:14.310> signal<00:02:14.760> it's<00:02:15.510> omnidirectional

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
this little signal it's omnidirectional

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.440 
this little signal it's omnidirectional
so<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.650> send<00:02:16.890> out<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.190> little<00:02:17.700> circle<00:02:18.269> basically

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
so to send out a little circle basically

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.630 
so to send out a little circle basically
in<00:02:18.959> all<00:02:19.140> directions<00:02:19.349> instead<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.190> like<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.340> wave

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
in all directions instead of like a wave

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.699 
in all directions instead of like a wave
on<00:02:20.940> your<00:02:21.090> UAV<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.750> you'll<00:02:22.260> be<00:02:22.379> able<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.530> see

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
on your UAV and you'll be able to see

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.040 
on your UAV and you'll be able to see
where<00:02:22.890> anybody<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.250> within<00:02:23.610> like<00:02:23.849> a<00:02:24.060> 15<00:02:24.690> meter

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
where anybody is within like a 15 meter

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.199 
where anybody is within like a 15 meter
radius<00:02:25.800> I'd<00:02:25.980> say<00:02:26.160> that's<00:02:26.340> just<00:02:26.489> a<00:02:26.760> rough

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
radius I'd say that's just a rough

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.780 
radius I'd say that's just a rough
estimate<00:02:27.360> but<00:02:27.750> it's<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:28.110> mini<00:02:28.440> UAV<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:29.040> hardline

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
estimate but it's a mini UAV a hardline

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.850 
estimate but it's a mini UAV a hardline
pro<00:02:29.970> that's<00:02:30.330> going<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.569> be<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.959> perk<00:02:31.290> across<00:02:31.709> the

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
pro that's going to be a perk across the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.490 
pro that's going to be a perk across the
board<00:02:32.040> except<00:02:32.400> for<00:02:32.519> one<00:02:32.700> class<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:33.300> just<00:02:34.200> it's

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
board except for one class I just it's

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.930 
board except for one class I just it's
just<00:02:34.709> a<00:02:34.769> generally<00:02:35.130> good<00:02:35.160> perk<00:02:35.519> and<00:02:35.700> it<00:02:35.790> works

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
just a generally good perk and it works

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.270 
just a generally good perk and it works
really<00:02:36.060> well<00:02:36.239> sleight<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.230> hand<00:02:37.500> another<00:02:37.920> just

really well sleight of hand another just
kind<00:02:38.550> of<00:02:38.610> general<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.390> know<00:02:39.480> park<00:02:39.810> that<00:02:39.930> works

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
kind of general you know park that works

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.630 
kind of general you know park that works
really<00:02:40.290> well<00:02:40.410> there's<00:02:40.890> two<00:02:41.040> classes<00:02:41.459> where<00:02:41.610> I

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
really well there's two classes where I

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.740 
really well there's two classes where I
don't<00:02:41.819> use<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.120> which<00:02:42.269> I'll<00:02:42.390> talk<00:02:42.510> about<00:02:42.569> a

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
don't use it which I'll talk about a

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.869 
don't use it which I'll talk about a
little<00:02:42.900> bit<00:02:43.049> and<00:02:43.260> ninja<00:02:43.980> again<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.549> pretty
