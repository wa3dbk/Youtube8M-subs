know about the hack of beam yeah in
muter<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.509> so<00:00:15.719> we<00:00:15.900> can<00:00:16.109> get<00:00:16.289> more<00:00:16.350> speed<00:00:16.590> than

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
muter and so we can get more speed than

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.820 
muter and so we can get more speed than
the<00:00:17.660> normal<00:00:18.660> speed<00:00:18.869> my<00:00:19.230> normal<00:00:19.619> speed

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
the normal speed my normal speed

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.599 
the normal speed my normal speed
downloading<00:00:20.670> speed<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.210> 50<00:00:22.140> 50<00:00:22.500> kbps<00:00:22.980> as<00:00:23.400> you

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
downloading speed is a 50 50 kbps as you

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.450
