was it does get a little more tangley
back<00:04:24.880> here<00:04:25.210> and<00:04:25.450> that's<00:04:25.600> why<00:04:25.750> I<00:04:25.810> have<00:04:25.960> to<00:04:26.110> use

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
back here and that's why I have to use

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.080 
back here and that's why I have to use
more<00:04:26.410> product<00:04:26.890> towards<00:04:27.220> the<00:04:27.310> back<00:04:27.490> of<00:04:27.520> my<00:04:27.700> hair
