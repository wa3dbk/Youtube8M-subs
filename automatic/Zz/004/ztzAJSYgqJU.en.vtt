so<00:01:47.729> i<00:01:47.759> really<00:01:48.210> i<00:01:48.649> originally<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.770> saw<00:01:50.130> night

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
so i really i originally I saw night

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.670 
so i really i originally I saw night
before<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.030> was<00:01:51.149> calculating<00:01:52.140> work<00:01:52.290> d<00:01:52.439> 2

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
before and I was calculating work d 2

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.530 
before and I was calculating work d 2
and<00:01:52.710> then<00:01:53.009> then<00:01:53.610> at<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.759> certain<00:01:53.820> point<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.360> saw

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
and then then at a certain point I saw

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.060 
and then then at a certain point I saw
the<00:01:54.600> movie<00:01:54.869> knight<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.320> e7<00:01:55.729> um<00:01:57.740> you<00:01:58.740> can<00:01:58.860> stick

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
the movie knight to e7 um you can stick

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.889 
the movie knight to e7 um you can stick
with<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.310> examiner<00:01:59.729> buttons<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.420> advance<00:02:00.750> to

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
with the examiner buttons to advance to

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.679 
with the examiner buttons to advance to
ok<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:01.579> so<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.610> thought<00:02:02.969> he<00:02:03.119> could<00:02:03.270> maybe<00:02:03.420> play

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
ok so so I thought he could maybe play

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.649 
ok so so I thought he could maybe play
knight<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.200> e7<00:02:04.350> here<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.009> after<00:02:05.130> 97<00:02:05.909> it's<00:02:06.060> uh<00:02:06.149> I

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
knight to e7 here and after 97 it's uh I

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.479 
knight to e7 here and after 97 it's uh I
was<00:02:07.140> actually<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.590> sacrifice<00:02:08.039> my<00:02:08.220> queen

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
was actually in a sacrifice my queen

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.330 
was actually in a sacrifice my queen
taking<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.090> rookie<00:02:09.539> won

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
taking in the rookie won

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.520 
taking in the rookie won
takes<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:11.000> it's<00:02:11.330> a<00:02:11.450> very<00:02:11.660> complicated<00:02:12.080> line

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
takes and it's a very complicated line

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.259 
takes and it's a very complicated line
but<00:02:12.800> I<00:02:12.830> thought<00:02:13.069> that<00:02:13.129> at<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.550> end<00:02:13.700> I<00:02:14.000> was<00:02:14.209> a

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
but I thought that at the end I was a

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.960 
but I thought that at the end I was a
little<00:02:14.569> bit<00:02:14.690> better<00:02:14.840> so<00:02:15.739> that's<00:02:15.940> so<00:02:16.940> that's

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
little bit better so that's so that's

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.640 
little bit better so that's so that's
sort<00:02:17.239> of<00:02:17.360> why<00:02:17.540> I<00:02:17.569> took<00:02:17.690> so<00:02:17.959> much<00:02:18.080> time<00:02:18.319> and<00:02:18.530> then

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
sort of why I took so much time and then

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.470 
sort of why I took so much time and then
lure<00:02:19.129> pretty<00:02:19.430> much<00:02:19.610> instantly<00:02:20.060> played<00:02:20.300> night

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
lure pretty much instantly played night

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.479 
lure pretty much instantly played night
before<00:02:20.959> which<00:02:21.200> was<00:02:21.500> right<00:02:22.069> it's<00:02:22.280> rather

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
before which was right it's rather

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.040 
before which was right it's rather
annoying<00:02:22.910> when<00:02:23.180> you<00:02:23.269> calculate<00:02:23.480> something

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
annoying when you calculate something

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.400 
annoying when you calculate something
like<00:02:24.319> that<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:24.769> then<00:02:24.920> have<00:02:25.550> someone<00:02:25.819> play<00:02:26.090> the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
like that and then have someone play the

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.990 
like that and then have someone play the
movie<00:02:27.410> you<00:02:27.620> calculate<00:02:28.160> originally<00:02:28.760> right

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
movie you calculate originally right

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.880 
movie you calculate originally right
away<00:02:29.299> sorta<00:02:29.989> sorta<00:02:30.019> was<00:02:30.349> like<00:02:30.500> why<00:02:30.680> did<00:02:30.830> I

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
away sorta sorta was like why did I

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.580 
away sorta sorta was like why did I
waste<00:02:31.099> all<00:02:31.340> that<00:02:31.370> time<00:02:31.580> calculating<00:02:32.540> so<00:02:33.500> I've

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
waste all that time calculating so I've

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.250 
waste all that time calculating so I've
played<00:02:33.799> rook<00:02:34.010> d2<00:02:34.370> as<00:02:34.700> as<00:02:35.120> I<00:02:35.390> wasn't<00:02:35.900> planning

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
played rook d2 as as I wasn't planning

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.890 
played rook d2 as as I wasn't planning
on<00:02:36.560> and<00:02:36.860> here<00:02:37.580> lubo<00:02:37.940> played<00:02:38.180> eat<00:02:38.450> aches<00:02:38.690> which

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
on and here lubo played eat aches which

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.750 
on and here lubo played eat aches which
kind<00:02:39.290> of<00:02:39.349> surprised<00:02:39.769> me<00:02:40.010> i<00:02:40.069> was<00:02:40.190> expecting<00:02:40.459> him

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
kind of surprised me i was expecting him

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.069 
kind of surprised me i was expecting him
to<00:02:40.790> actually<00:02:41.090> play<00:02:42.160> Knight<00:02:43.160> takes<00:02:43.430> d5<00:02:43.940> but<00:02:44.360> he

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
to actually play Knight takes d5 but he

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.319 
to actually play Knight takes d5 but he
took<00:02:45.260> with<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.500> pawn<00:02:45.739> and<00:02:46.130> I<00:02:46.640> thought<00:02:47.030> right

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:47.329 
took with the pawn and I thought right

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:49.059 
took with the pawn and I thought right
around<00:02:47.569> here<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:47.930> was<00:02:48.319> slightly<00:02:48.590> better

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
around here I was slightly better

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.130 
around here I was slightly better
because<00:02:49.519> I<00:02:49.670> because<00:02:50.269> the<00:02:50.420> pawn<00:02:50.630> structure<00:02:50.959> is

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
because I because the pawn structure is

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.830 
because I because the pawn structure is
more<00:02:51.319> favorable<00:02:51.530> especially<00:02:52.459> with<00:02:52.519> the

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
more favorable especially with the

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.280 
more favorable especially with the
isolated<00:02:53.840> d<00:02:54.019> pawn<00:02:54.319> on<00:02:54.500> d5<00:02:54.980> here<00:02:55.459> however<00:02:56.290> the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
isolated d pawn on d5 here however the

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.180 
isolated d pawn on d5 here however the
tide<00:02:57.709> pretty<00:02:58.010> much<00:02:58.190> changed<00:02:58.700> in<00:02:58.910> a<00:02:59.000> hurry<00:02:59.329> um

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
tide pretty much changed in a hurry um

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.770 
tide pretty much changed in a hurry um
simply<00:03:01.190> due<00:03:01.340> to<00:03:01.370> due<00:03:01.970> to<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.180> fact<00:03:02.360> that<00:03:02.540> I<00:03:02.629> had

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
simply due to due to the fact that I had

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.680 
simply due to due to the fact that I had
to<00:03:02.900> rearrange<00:03:03.200> my<00:03:03.560> pieces<00:03:03.860> and<00:03:04.420> then<00:03:05.420> come<00:03:05.660> up

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
to rearrange my pieces and then come up

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.720 
to rearrange my pieces and then come up
with<00:03:05.870> a<00:03:05.930> plan<00:03:06.170> so<00:03:06.560> at<00:03:06.769> this<00:03:06.890> way<00:03:07.099> at<00:03:07.340> this<00:03:07.400> point

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
with a plan so at this way at this point

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.240 
with a plan so at this way at this point
after<00:03:07.910> playing<00:03:08.269> rook<00:03:08.780> d1<00:03:09.170> and<00:03:09.349> Bishop<00:03:09.560> g1<00:03:09.980> I

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
after playing rook d1 and Bishop g1 I

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.190 
after playing rook d1 and Bishop g1 I
thought<00:03:10.879> that<00:03:11.030> I<00:03:11.090> was<00:03:11.269> all<00:03:11.569> right<00:03:11.599> here<00:03:12.170> I

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
thought that I was all right here I

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.539 
thought that I was all right here I
didn't<00:03:12.410> think<00:03:12.500> I<00:03:12.620> was<00:03:12.739> better<00:03:13.010> but<00:03:13.220> I<00:03:13.310> thought

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
didn't think I was better but I thought

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.220 
didn't think I was better but I thought
I<00:03:13.579> was<00:03:13.819> I<00:03:14.150> wasn't<00:03:14.660> worse<00:03:15.109> at<00:03:15.410> least<00:03:15.440> on<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:17.230> I'm

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
I was I wasn't worse at least on and I'm

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.090 
I was I wasn't worse at least on and I'm
pretty<00:03:19.160> much<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.760> was<00:03:20.600> fairly<00:03:20.900> standard<00:03:21.590> up

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
pretty much the was fairly standard up

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.650 
pretty much the was fairly standard up
until<00:03:22.549> this<00:03:22.700> point<00:03:22.760> went<00:03:23.120> in<00:03:23.209> lieu<00:03:23.359> of<00:03:23.389> a

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
until this point went in lieu of a

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.140 
until this point went in lieu of a
rookie<00:03:23.870> for<00:03:24.319> probably<00:03:25.250> Queen<00:03:25.489> B<00:03:25.639> 7<00:03:26.030> was<00:03:26.120> a

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
rookie for probably Queen B 7 was a

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.289 
rookie for probably Queen B 7 was a
slightly<00:03:26.540> better<00:03:26.780> try<00:03:27.940> instead<00:03:28.940> of<00:03:29.000> on

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
slightly better try instead of on

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:30.849 
slightly better try instead of on
trading<00:03:29.720> off<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:29.989> app<00:03:30.079> for<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.319> be<00:03:30.560> pawns

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
trading off the app for the be pawns

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:32.650 
trading off the app for the be pawns
because<00:03:31.220> it<00:03:31.340> meant<00:03:31.489> makes<00:03:32.000> a<00:03:32.150> little<00:03:32.299> bit<00:03:32.510> more

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
because it meant makes a little bit more

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.410 
because it meant makes a little bit more
difficult<00:03:32.840> for<00:03:33.139> me<00:03:33.319> to<00:03:33.410> come<00:03:33.560> up<00:03:33.650> with<00:03:33.709> a<00:03:33.859> plan

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
difficult for me to come up with a plan

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.599 
difficult for me to come up with a plan
after<00:03:35.420> working<00:03:35.690> for<00:03:35.720> take<00:03:36.109> stakes<00:03:36.500> I<00:03:36.799> play

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
after working for take stakes I play

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.819 
after working for take stakes I play
Bishop<00:03:37.790> jus<00:03:38.090> one<00:03:38.299> rookie<00:03:38.660> for<00:03:38.870> a<00:03:38.900> five<00:03:39.500> and

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
Bishop jus one rookie for a five and

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.800 
Bishop jus one rookie for a five and
really<00:03:40.609> my<00:03:40.730> point<00:03:40.940> was<00:03:41.120> simply<00:03:41.150> that<00:03:41.510> here<00:03:41.780> i

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
really my point was simply that here i

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.870 
really my point was simply that here i
have<00:03:42.349> a<00:03:42.410> very<00:03:42.620> direct<00:03:43.040> plan<00:03:43.370> like<00:03:43.579> I'm<00:03:43.669> just

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
have a very direct plan like I'm just

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.759 
have a very direct plan like I'm just
going<00:03:44.000> to<00:03:44.030> plead<00:03:44.239> b4<00:03:44.630> b5<00:03:45.049> then<00:03:45.349> push<00:03:45.560> that<00:03:45.590> a

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
going to plead b4 b5 then push that a

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.190 
going to plead b4 b5 then push that a
pawn<00:03:46.099> to<00:03:46.250> a<00:03:46.340> seventh<00:03:46.910> and<00:03:47.030> then<00:03:47.150> Black<00:03:47.870> has<00:03:48.049> to

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
pawn to a seventh and then Black has to

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.870 
pawn to a seventh and then Black has to
do<00:03:48.319> something<00:03:48.650> to<00:03:48.950> keep<00:03:49.130> the<00:03:49.639> pawn<00:03:49.849> for

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
do something to keep the pawn for

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.559 
do something to keep the pawn for
queening<00:03:50.540> so<00:03:51.910> right<00:03:52.910> around<00:03:53.030> this<00:03:53.329> point

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
queening so right around this point

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.140 
queening so right around this point
after<00:03:53.780> I<00:03:54.230> played<00:03:54.709> b5<00:03:55.220> I<00:03:55.250> was<00:03:55.459> pretty<00:03:55.639> confident

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
after I played b5 I was pretty confident

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.500 
after I played b5 I was pretty confident
that<00:03:56.269> I<00:03:56.450> good<00:03:56.780> chances<00:03:57.260> to<00:03:57.410> win<00:03:57.590> here<00:03:57.919> so

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
that I good chances to win here so

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.539 
that I good chances to win here so
pretty<00:03:59.510> much<00:03:59.660> the<00:03:59.810> rest<00:03:59.989> was<00:04:00.290> a<00:04:00.590> mad<00:04:01.190> times

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
pretty much the rest was a mad times

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:02.949 
pretty much the rest was a mad times
ground<00:04:01.910> we<00:04:02.060> both<00:04:02.299> didn't<00:04:02.599> have<00:04:02.690> a<00:04:02.780> whole<00:04:02.930> lot

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
ground we both didn't have a whole lot

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.520 
ground we both didn't have a whole lot
of<00:04:03.139> time<00:04:03.470> we<00:04:04.069> were<00:04:04.190> only<00:04:04.310> at<00:04:05.090> move<00:04:05.450> 31<00:04:06.290> when<00:04:06.500> I

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
of time we were only at move 31 when I

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.890 
of time we were only at move 31 when I
played<00:04:06.829> be<00:04:07.069> five<00:04:07.370> so<00:04:07.730> 90<00:04:08.060> these<00:04:08.419> times<00:04:08.660> about

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
played be five so 90 these times about

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.930 
played be five so 90 these times about
accurate<00:04:09.349> you're<00:04:09.500> both<00:04:09.620> pretty<00:04:10.010> close<00:04:10.400> yes

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
accurate you're both pretty close yes

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.069 
accurate you're both pretty close yes
yeah<00:04:11.780> these<00:04:11.959> times<00:04:12.230> are<00:04:12.380> quite<00:04:12.799> accurate<00:04:14.079> and

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
yeah these times are quite accurate and

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:16.480 
yeah these times are quite accurate and
then

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:16.490 
then

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:21.260 
then
after<00:04:17.490> after<00:04:17.910> Lou<00:04:18.240> played<00:04:18.540> before<00:04:19.370> ace<00:04:20.370> before

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
after after Lou played before ace before

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.350 
after after Lou played before ace before
just<00:04:21.600> a<00:04:21.690> blunder<00:04:22.320> probably<00:04:23.220> rookie<00:04:23.670> give<00:04:24.150> some

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
just a blunder probably rookie give some

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.420 
just a blunder probably rookie give some
better<00:04:24.540> chances<00:04:25.020> to<00:04:25.200> draw<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:25.800> game<00:04:26.130> but<00:04:26.310> it's

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
better chances to draw the game but it's

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.150 
better chances to draw the game but it's
still<00:04:26.670> slightly<00:04:27.210> worse<00:04:27.600> and<00:04:28.080> to<00:04:28.350> you<00:04:28.620> he<00:04:29.040> would

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
still slightly worse and to you he would

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.390 
still slightly worse and to you he would
have<00:04:29.190> had<00:04:29.340> suffered<00:04:30.060> for<00:04:30.210> quite<00:04:30.480> a<00:04:30.510> bit<00:04:30.920> if<00:04:31.920> in

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
have had suffered for quite a bit if in

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.480 
have had suffered for quite a bit if in
fact<00:04:32.580> he<00:04:32.730> had<00:04:32.850> been<00:04:33.000> able<00:04:33.180> to<00:04:33.330> hold<00:04:33.510> the<00:04:33.660> draw

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
fact he had been able to hold the draw

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.130 
fact he had been able to hold the draw
did<00:04:35.490> any<00:04:35.640> insights<00:04:36.450> come<00:04:36.660> out<00:04:36.780> of<00:04:36.930> here

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
did any insights come out of here

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.950 
did any insights come out of here
post-mortem<00:04:38.100> session<00:04:38.400> well<00:04:39.390> I<00:04:39.420> think<00:04:39.570> really

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
post-mortem session well I think really

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.700 
post-mortem session well I think really
the<00:04:40.200> main<00:04:40.560> thing<00:04:40.620> is<00:04:40.950> that<00:04:41.070> we<00:04:41.370> had<00:04:41.490> a<00:04:41.550> huge<00:04:42.710> we

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
the main thing is that we had a huge we

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.680 
the main thing is that we had a huge we
are<00:04:44.160> perspective<00:04:44.580> of<00:04:44.970> the<00:04:45.030> position<00:04:45.570> was

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
are perspective of the position was

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.870 
are perspective of the position was
considerably<00:04:46.350> different<00:04:46.620> prior<00:04:47.550> to<00:04:47.790> the

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
considerably different prior to the

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.840 
considerably different prior to the
post-game<00:04:48.360> analysis<00:04:49.250> lubo<00:04:50.250> thought<00:04:50.520> that<00:04:50.730> he

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
post-game analysis lubo thought that he

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.400 
post-game analysis lubo thought that he
was<00:04:50.970> much<00:04:51.570> better<00:04:51.840> um<00:04:53.540> after<00:04:54.540> we<00:04:55.170> started

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
was much better um after we started

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:56.930 
was much better um after we started
developing<00:04:55.590> our<00:04:56.040> pieces<00:04:56.250> even<00:04:56.550> when<00:04:56.790> he<00:04:56.850> at

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
developing our pieces even when he at

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.940 
developing our pieces even when he at
the<00:04:57.060> isolate<00:04:57.570> upon<00:04:57.840> D<00:04:58.110> Phi<00:04:58.320> words<00:04:58.650> I<00:04:58.740> thought

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
the isolate upon D Phi words I thought

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.920 
the isolate upon D Phi words I thought
it<00:04:59.370> was<00:04:59.460> roughly<00:04:59.910> equal<00:05:00.330> maybe<00:05:00.600> he<00:05:00.810> was

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
it was roughly equal maybe he was

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.650 
it was roughly equal maybe he was
marginally<00:05:01.530> better<00:05:01.680> so<00:05:02.220> there<00:05:02.850> we<00:05:03.330> didn't

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
marginally better so there we didn't

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.960 
marginally better so there we didn't
necessarily<00:05:04.050> agree<00:05:04.710> on<00:05:04.830> that<00:05:04.980> by<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.340> mo<00:05:05.760> bo

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
necessarily agree on that by the mo bo

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.820 
necessarily agree on that by the mo bo
had<00:05:06.360> come<00:05:06.570> around<00:05:06.780> more<00:05:07.230> or<00:05:07.380> less<00:05:07.560> the

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
had come around more or less the

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.160 
had come around more or less the
conclusion<00:05:08.400> that<00:05:08.430> it<00:05:08.940> was<00:05:09.450> definitely<00:05:09.960> better

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
conclusion that it was definitely better

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.160 
conclusion that it was definitely better
for<00:05:10.590> him<00:05:10.710> but<00:05:11.280> it<00:05:11.760> wasn't<00:05:12.360> quite<00:05:12.480> as<00:05:12.780> easy<00:05:12.960> as

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
for him but it wasn't quite as easy as

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.340 
for him but it wasn't quite as easy as
he<00:05:13.320> originally<00:05:13.740> thought<00:05:13.950> it<00:05:14.130> was<00:05:14.720> now<00:05:15.720> when<00:05:16.110> in

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
he originally thought it was now when in

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.470 
he originally thought it was now when in
that<00:05:16.380> game<00:05:16.740> that<00:05:16.950> you<00:05:17.130> mentioned<00:05:17.490> last<00:05:18.120> year

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
that game that you mentioned last year

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.780 
that game that you mentioned last year
you<00:05:18.870> you<00:05:19.560> had<00:05:19.710> good<00:05:19.980> winning<00:05:20.190> chances<00:05:20.640> and

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
you you had good winning chances and

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.850 
you you had good winning chances and
then<00:05:20.880> it<00:05:21.000> ended<00:05:21.210> in<00:05:21.390> a<00:05:21.480> draw<00:05:21.600> well<00:05:22.110> no<00:05:22.410> that<00:05:22.710> was

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
then it ended in a draw well no that was

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.860 
then it ended in a draw well no that was
no<00:05:23.220> I<00:05:23.250> was<00:05:23.550> referring<00:05:23.580> to<00:05:24.030> the<00:05:24.150> second<00:05:24.600> game<00:05:24.750> in

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
no I was referring to the second game in

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.630 
no I was referring to the second game in
which<00:05:25.110> I<00:05:25.200> lost<00:05:25.500> the<00:05:25.800> game<00:05:25.980> everything<00:05:26.340> I<00:05:26.430> was

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
which I lost the game everything I was

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.980 
which I lost the game everything I was
the<00:05:26.760> game<00:05:26.940> which<00:05:27.090> I<00:05:27.180> played<00:05:27.450> in<00:05:27.600> the<00:05:27.660> first<00:05:27.780> in

blocked<00:05:56.760> it<00:05:56.940> out<00:05:57.060> so<00:05:57.510> pretty<00:05:58.320> much<00:05:58.530> I<00:05:59.120> remember

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
blocked it out so pretty much I remember

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.940 
blocked it out so pretty much I remember
the<00:06:00.210> games<00:06:00.510> but<00:06:00.900> I<00:06:00.930> don't<00:06:01.260> but<00:06:01.680> it's<00:06:01.800> not
