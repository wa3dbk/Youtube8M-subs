00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.940 
and be very cautious until you get into
turn<00:01:26.850> one<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.390> even<00:01:28.109> guys<00:01:28.409> with<00:01:28.619> massive

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
turn one so even guys with massive

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.620 
turn one so even guys with massive
amount<00:01:29.219> of<00:01:29.310> experience<00:01:29.700> can<00:01:30.060> make<00:01:30.210> mistakes

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
amount of experience can make mistakes

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.569 
amount of experience can make mistakes
but<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:31.109> think<00:01:31.469> they<00:01:31.560> did<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> bit<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:31.950> damage<00:01:32.130> to

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
but I think they did a bit of damage to

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.950 
but I think they did a bit of damage to
the<00:01:32.670> race<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.119> it'll<00:01:33.240> be<00:01:33.299> very<00:01:33.450> interesting<00:01:33.570> to

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
the race so it'll be very interesting to

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.200 
the race so it'll be very interesting to
see<00:01:34.140> what<00:01:34.560> happens<00:01:34.619> going<00:01:35.219> forward<00:01:35.369> with

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
see what happens going forward with

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.730 
see what happens going forward with
whether<00:01:36.600> we<00:01:36.689> have<00:01:36.780> Ozzy's<00:01:37.109> back<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.469> the<00:01:37.560> car

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
whether we have Ozzy's back in the car

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.319 
whether we have Ozzy's back in the car
or<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.070> bit<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.340> mixture<00:01:38.579> but<00:01:38.850> surely<00:01:39.210> we

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
or a bit of a mixture but surely we

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.880 
or a bit of a mixture but surely we
can't<00:01:39.570> nurse<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.140> internationals<00:01:40.710> through

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
can't nurse the internationals through

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.169 
can't nurse the internationals through
and<00:01:41.039> just<00:01:41.070> give<00:01:41.399> them<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.579> middle<00:01:41.789> stint

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
and just give them the middle stint

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:43.550 
and just give them the middle stint
they've<00:01:42.570> got<00:01:42.719> to<00:01:42.810> be<00:01:42.869> good<00:01:42.990> enough<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.469> have

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
they've got to be good enough and have

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.020 
they've got to be good enough and have
enough<00:01:43.770> time<00:01:43.979> behind<00:01:44.219> the<00:01:44.399> wheel<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.820> at<00:01:44.939> the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
enough time behind the wheel and at the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.029 
enough time behind the wheel and at the
test<00:01:45.240> day<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.990> perfect<00:01:46.380> or<00:01:46.560> get<00:01:46.710> close<00:01:46.829> to

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
test day to perfect or get close to

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.830 
test day to perfect or get close to
perfection<00:01:47.340> as<00:01:47.549> far<00:01:47.729> as<00:01:47.820> making<00:01:47.999> good<00:01:48.479> starts

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
perfection as far as making good starts

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.450 
perfection as far as making good starts
concern<00:01:49.170> it's<00:01:49.469> not<00:01:49.590> impossible<00:01:49.859> because<00:01:50.340> we

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
concern it's not impossible because we

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.459 
concern it's not impossible because we
see<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.670> good<00:01:50.820> guys<00:01:50.999> Sebastien<00:01:51.780> Bourdais<00:01:51.899> etc

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
see the good guys Sebastien Bourdais etc

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.349 
see the good guys Sebastien Bourdais etc
they<00:01:52.590> all<00:01:52.740> do<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.009> yeah<00:01:53.429> look<00:01:53.789> one<00:01:53.999> way<00:01:54.030> that

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:54.359 
they all do it yeah look one way that

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:56.690 
they all do it yeah look one way that
may<00:01:54.509> be<00:01:54.570> over<00:01:54.929> all<00:01:55.469> to<00:01:55.619> combat<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.159> start<00:01:56.460> line

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
may be over all to combat the start line

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.520 
may be over all to combat the start line
would<00:01:56.880> be<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.119> perhaps<00:01:57.270> make<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.079> hard<00:01:58.259> toy

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
would be to perhaps make it a hard toy

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.219 
would be to perhaps make it a hard toy
race<00:01:58.829> only<00:01:59.039> because<00:01:59.880> with<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.210> hard<00:02:00.420> tyre<00:02:00.719> you

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
race only because with the hard tyre you

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.779 
race only because with the hard tyre you
can<00:02:01.380> at<00:02:01.439> least<00:02:01.499> spin<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:01.979> tire<00:02:02.189> up<00:02:02.429> and<00:02:02.670> get

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
can at least spin the tire up and get

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.399 
can at least spin the tire up and get
some<00:02:02.969> momentum<00:02:03.090> going<00:02:03.479> or<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:03.840> with<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.140> soft

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
some momentum going or is with the soft

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.599 
some momentum going or is with the soft
if<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.619> heat<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:04.920> up<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.249> they're<00:02:05.340> all<00:02:05.460> doing

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:05.609 
if you heat it up and they're all doing

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:07.730 
if you heat it up and they're all doing
a<00:02:05.759> lot<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.030> practice<00:02:06.479> starts<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.499> cars

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
a lot of practice starts and the cars

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.320 
a lot of practice starts and the cars
just<00:02:07.950> bogged<00:02:08.220> down<00:02:08.310> same<00:02:08.850> when<00:02:09.030> they<00:02:09.149> when

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
just bogged down same when they when

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.490 
just bogged down same when they when
they<00:02:09.390> run<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.660> handbrake<00:02:10.050> or<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.319> line

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
they run the handbrake or the line

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.980 
they run the handbrake or the line
Locker<00:02:10.830> off<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.160> off<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.640> start<00:02:12.060> line<00:02:12.270> very

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
Locker off the off the start line very

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.960 
Locker off the off the start line very
easy<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.410> stall<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.740> cars<00:02:13.980> so<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.490> don't<00:02:14.880> know

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
easy to stall the cars so I don't know

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.760 
easy to stall the cars so I don't know
on<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.240> test<00:02:15.480> day<00:02:15.660> how<00:02:15.900> many<00:02:16.080> actual<00:02:16.230> practice

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
on the test day how many actual practice

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.020 
on the test day how many actual practice
starts<00:02:17.069> they<00:02:17.190> did<00:02:17.370> but<00:02:17.490> they<00:02:17.520> probably<00:02:17.790> did

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
starts they did but they probably did

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.490 
starts they did but they probably did
them<00:02:18.150> on<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.360> hard<00:02:18.540> side<00:02:18.630> then<00:02:19.050> they<00:02:19.140> go<00:02:19.319> on

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
them on the hard side then they go on

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.830 
them on the hard side then they go on
fresh<00:02:19.740> soft<00:02:20.069> and<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.730> course<00:02:20.940> all<00:02:21.150> chaos<00:02:21.540> broke

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
fresh soft and of course all chaos broke

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.619 
fresh soft and of course all chaos broke
loose<00:02:21.900> oh<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.459> hope<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.610> events<00:02:23.909> days<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.360> like

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
loose oh I hope the events days I like

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.210 
loose oh I hope the events days I like
that<00:02:24.900> we<00:02:25.049> get<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.319> right<00:02:25.530> kind<00:02:26.069> of

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
that we get the right kind of

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.309 
that we get the right kind of
internationals<00:02:26.879> high-profile<00:02:27.629> ones<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.080> we

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
internationals high-profile ones and we

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.300 
internationals high-profile ones and we
sort<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:28.739> work<00:02:28.950> on

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
sort of work on

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.190 
sort of work on
giving<00:02:29.640> him<00:02:29.760> an<00:02:29.910> extra<00:02:30.420> test<00:02:30.750> day<00:02:30.959> or

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
giving him an extra test day or

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.839 
giving him an extra test day or
something<00:02:31.800> so<00:02:31.980> we<00:02:32.010> just<00:02:32.220> don't<00:02:32.430> get<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:32.580> repeat

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
something so we just don't get a repeat

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.580 
something so we just don't get a repeat
of<00:02:32.910> what<00:02:33.090> happened<00:02:33.150> in<00:02:33.480> 2012<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.230> if<00:02:34.380> we<00:02:34.470> only

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
of what happened in 2012 and if we only

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.290 
of what happened in 2012 and if we only
get<00:02:34.830> 16<00:02:35.280> good<00:02:35.459> internationals<00:02:36.000> then<00:02:36.120> there's

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
get 16 good internationals then there's

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.490 
get 16 good internationals then there's
some<00:02:36.450> pretty<00:02:36.569> good<00:02:36.750> local<00:02:37.050> guys<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.230> good

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
some pretty good local guys a good

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.720 
some pretty good local guys a good
jumping<00:02:37.800> I'm<00:02:38.010> sure<00:02:38.280> there'll<00:02:38.459> be<00:02:38.489> plenty

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
jumping I'm sure there'll be plenty

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.640 
jumping I'm sure there'll be plenty
putting<00:02:39.330> their<00:02:39.450> hands<00:02:39.690> up<00:02:39.750> but<00:02:39.959> you<00:02:40.319> know<00:02:40.440> the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
putting their hands up but you know the

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.410 
putting their hands up but you know the
year<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.980> car<00:02:41.190> fan<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:41.459> won<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:42.000> next<00:02:42.150> day

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
year the car fan I won the next day

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.870 
year the car fan I won the next day
Steve<00:02:42.810> Owen<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.410> know<00:02:43.560> one<00:02:44.489> with<00:02:44.640> Jamie

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
Steve Owen you know one with Jamie

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.339 
Steve Owen you know one with Jamie
Whincup<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:45.450> obviously<00:02:45.720> helped<00:02:46.019> him<00:02:46.140> get<00:02:46.290> a

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
Whincup that obviously helped him get a

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.220 
Whincup that obviously helped him get a
seat<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.980> next<00:02:47.010> year<00:02:47.400> so<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:48.630> know<00:02:48.720> it<00:02:48.959> the

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
seat the next year so you know it the

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.809 
seat the next year so you know it the
track<00:02:49.500> can<00:02:49.680> bite<00:02:49.890> you<00:02:49.920> hard<00:02:50.340> but<00:02:50.610> it's<00:02:50.730> a

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
track can bite you hard but it's a

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.430 
track can bite you hard but it's a
fantastic<00:02:51.480> circuit<00:02:51.900> I<00:02:51.989> like<00:02:52.230> what<00:02:52.410> they've

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
fantastic circuit I like what they've

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.890 
fantastic circuit I like what they've
done<00:02:52.709> with<00:02:53.010> shortening<00:02:53.580> it<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:53.849> let's<00:02:54.720> hope

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
done with shortening it and let's hope

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.170 
done with shortening it and let's hope
that<00:02:55.110> it<00:02:55.200> continues<00:02:55.319> to<00:02:55.980> be<00:02:56.250> successful<00:02:56.700> event

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
that it continues to be successful event

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.600 
that it continues to be successful event
from<00:02:57.480> tweaking<00:02:58.170> not<00:02:58.349> changing<00:02:58.800> today<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:59.250> agree

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
from tweaking not changing today I agree

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.350 
from tweaking not changing today I agree
absolutely<00:02:59.730> i<00:03:00.890> think<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.360> international

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
absolutely i think the international

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.940 
absolutely i think the international
component<00:03:03.690> has<00:03:04.019> worked<00:03:04.230> well<00:03:04.380> over<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.830> last

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
component has worked well over the last

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.430 
component has worked well over the last
sort<00:03:05.400> of<00:03:05.430> two<00:03:05.640> seasons<00:03:05.880> we've<00:03:06.150> had<00:03:06.239> some

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
sort of two seasons we've had some

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.900 
sort of two seasons we've had some
extremely<00:03:07.440> competent<00:03:07.860> driver<00:03:08.010> some<00:03:08.430> some<00:03:08.730> big

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
extremely competent driver some some big

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.479 
extremely competent driver some some big
names<00:03:09.090> from<00:03:09.720> all<00:03:09.930> around<00:03:10.019> the<00:03:10.200> world<00:03:10.489> clearly

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
names from all around the world clearly

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.070 
names from all around the world clearly
the<00:03:11.640> last<00:03:12.120> couple<00:03:12.360> of<00:03:12.390> years<00:03:12.450> our<00:03:12.750> biggest

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
the last couple of years our biggest

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.630 
the last couple of years our biggest
problem<00:03:13.380> there<00:03:13.500> has<00:03:13.620> been<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:13.830> circuit<00:03:14.220> as<00:03:14.580> a

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
problem there has been the circuit as a

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.449 
problem there has been the circuit as a
necessarily<00:03:15.120> been<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.540> drivers<00:03:16.200> if<00:03:17.130> we<00:03:17.310> can

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
necessarily been the drivers if we can

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:18.949 
necessarily been the drivers if we can
keep<00:03:17.610> that<00:03:17.790> under<00:03:17.940> control<00:03:18.209> this<00:03:18.599> year<00:03:18.780> was<00:03:18.930> a

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
keep that under control this year was a

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.110 
keep that under control this year was a
lot<00:03:19.110> better<00:03:19.230> then<00:03:19.709> i<00:03:20.489> think<00:03:20.849> they're<00:03:20.970> still

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
lot better then i think they're still

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.640 
lot better then i think they're still
knowledge<00:03:21.510> in<00:03:21.630> that<00:03:21.660> format<00:03:22.110> it's<00:03:22.290> definitely

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
knowledge in that format it's definitely

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.229 
knowledge in that format it's definitely
interesting<00:03:22.830> that<00:03:23.310> maybe<00:03:23.519> maybe<00:03:23.849> they<00:03:24.060> should

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
interesting that maybe maybe they should

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.089 
interesting that maybe maybe they should
qualify<00:03:24.390> for<00:03:25.319> their<00:03:25.500> race<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:25.920> they<00:03:25.980> have

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
qualify for their race and they have

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.470 
qualify for their race and they have
their<00:03:26.250> own<00:03:26.280> race<00:03:26.640> and<00:03:26.819> then<00:03:26.910> we<00:03:27.000> have<00:03:27.180> a<00:03:27.209> race

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
their own race and then we have a race

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.309 
their own race and then we have a race
but<00:03:27.980> you<00:03:28.980> know<00:03:29.040> it's<00:03:29.420> just<00:03:30.420> good<00:03:30.569> racing<00:03:30.989> the

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
but you know it's just good racing the

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.289 
but you know it's just good racing the
last<00:03:31.500> couple<00:03:31.680> of<00:03:31.830> years<00:03:31.890> and<00:03:32.280> it's<00:03:33.150> better

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
last couple of years and it's better

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.180 
last couple of years and it's better
than<00:03:33.450> international<00:03:34.049> Flair<00:03:34.260> on<00:03:34.410> it<00:03:34.530> but<00:03:34.709> it's

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
than international Flair on it but it's

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.770 
than international Flair on it but it's
always<00:03:35.340> always<00:03:35.790> remember<00:03:36.269> changing<00:03:36.450> their

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
always always remember changing their

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.210 
always always remember changing their
always<00:03:37.019> chopping<00:03:37.350> and<00:03:37.470> changing<00:03:37.590> things<00:03:38.010> so

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
always chopping and changing things so

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.979 
always chopping and changing things so
can't<00:03:39.000> see<00:03:39.120> it<00:03:39.209> staying<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.540> same<00:03:39.570> for<00:03:39.870> too

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
can't see it staying the same for too

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.710 
can't see it staying the same for too
long<00:03:40.200> I<00:03:40.410> think<00:03:41.400> you've<00:03:41.489> asked<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.299> team

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
long I think you've asked the team

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.870 
long I think you've asked the team
owners<00:03:43.140> they'd<00:03:43.350> say<00:03:43.560> yes<00:03:43.829> I<00:03:44.340> think<00:03:44.760> the

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
owners they'd say yes I think the

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.140 
owners they'd say yes I think the
punters<00:03:45.269> loved<00:03:45.569> it<00:03:45.859> although<00:03:46.859> you<00:03:46.920> know<00:03:47.250> asses

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
punters loved it although you know asses

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.460 
punters loved it although you know asses
drivers<00:03:48.600> when<00:03:48.780> we're<00:03:48.930> fighting<00:03:49.260> for<00:03:49.290> a

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
drivers when we're fighting for a

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.520 
drivers when we're fighting for a
championship<00:03:49.940> and<00:03:50.940> that<00:03:51.810> round<00:03:52.109> does<00:03:52.319> go

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
championship and that round does go

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.039 
championship and that round does go
towards<00:03:52.890> our<00:03:53.010> championship<00:03:53.750> you<00:03:54.750> know<00:03:54.870> that

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
towards our championship you know that

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.720 
towards our championship you know that
can<00:03:55.200> really<00:03:55.380> throw<00:03:56.299> your<00:03:57.299> opportunity<00:03:58.049> out<00:03:58.260> of

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
can really throw your opportunity out of

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.050 
can really throw your opportunity out of
you<00:03:59.730> know<00:03:59.850> fighting<00:04:00.239> for<00:04:00.569> it<00:04:00.690> so<00:04:00.900> I<00:04:01.650> think<00:04:02.280> Isis

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
you know fighting for it so I think Isis

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.120 
you know fighting for it so I think Isis
drivers<00:04:03.420> we'd<00:04:03.569> probably<00:04:03.780> prefer<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.470> primary

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
drivers we'd probably prefer the primary

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.360 
drivers we'd probably prefer the primary
drivers<00:04:05.430> to<00:04:05.579> start<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:05.970> car<00:04:06.739> for<00:04:07.739> me<00:04:07.769> Simon

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
drivers to start the car for me Simon

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.849 
drivers to start the car for me Simon
did<00:04:09.209> a<00:04:09.239> great<00:04:09.480> job<00:04:09.510> there<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:09.989> an<00:04:10.560> I'd<00:04:10.709> have

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
did a great job there and an I'd have

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.280 
did a great job there and an I'd have
him<00:04:11.010> start<00:04:11.310> every<00:04:11.670> every<00:04:12.299> time<00:04:12.510> if<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:12.989> wanted

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
him start every every time if you wanted

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.229 
him start every every time if you wanted
but<00:04:13.470> you<00:04:13.920> know<00:04:14.400> there's<00:04:14.579> other<00:04:14.730> guys<00:04:14.910> that

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
but you know there's other guys that

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.180 
but you know there's other guys that
don't<00:04:15.840> do<00:04:15.989> many<00:04:16.169> starts<00:04:16.620> and<00:04:16.769> that's<00:04:16.889> when<00:04:17.070> the

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
don't do many starts and that's when the

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.520 
don't do many starts and that's when the
problems<00:04:17.400> occur<00:04:17.880> I<00:04:18.109> think<00:04:19.109> it<00:04:19.169> should<00:04:19.289> stay<00:04:19.350> i

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
problems occur I think it should stay i

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:20.509 
problems occur I think it should stay i
think<00:04:19.799> i<00:04:19.859> think<00:04:19.979> it's<00:04:20.100> great<00:04:20.190> when<00:04:20.400> all

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
think i think it's great when all

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.800 
think i think it's great when all
international<00:04:21.000> drivers<00:04:21.299> come<00:04:21.450> out<00:04:21.539> and<00:04:21.660> drive

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
international drivers come out and drive

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.810 
international drivers come out and drive
our<00:04:21.930> cars<00:04:22.169> i<00:04:22.380> think<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:23.220> start<00:04:23.520> of<00:04:23.639> the<00:04:23.700> race

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
our cars i think the start of the race

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.219 
our cars i think the start of the race
it<00:04:24.030> should<00:04:24.150> be<00:04:24.240> compulsory<00:04:24.690> to<00:04:24.780> start<00:04:25.080> your

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
it should be compulsory to start your

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.070 
it should be compulsory to start your
lead<00:04:25.380> driver<00:04:25.650> and<00:04:26.250> take<00:04:26.490> us<00:04:26.610> away<00:04:26.850> from<00:04:27.080> some

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
lead driver and take us away from some

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.629 
lead driver and take us away from some
of<00:04:28.169> the<00:04:28.229> cons<00:04:28.440> we<00:04:28.770> saw<00:04:28.979> at<00:04:29.130> the<00:04:29.160> start<00:04:29.460> of<00:04:29.520> this

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
of the cons we saw at the start of this

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.340 
of the cons we saw at the start of this
year<00:04:29.700> and<00:04:29.970> force<00:04:30.510> the<00:04:30.690> teams<00:04:30.900> to<00:04:31.080> build<00:04:31.289> a

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
year and force the teams to build a

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.779 
year and force the teams to build a
strategy<00:04:31.680> around<00:04:31.889> starting<00:04:32.520> their<00:04:32.639> lead

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
strategy around starting their lead

strategy around starting their lead
driver<00:04:33.030> I<00:04:33.360> think<00:04:34.050> I<00:04:34.320> mean<00:04:35.039> clearly<00:04:35.460> it's

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
driver I think I mean clearly it's

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.550 
driver I think I mean clearly it's
working<00:04:36.600> quite<00:04:36.780> well<00:04:36.810> where<00:04:37.200> I<00:04:37.229> mean<00:04:37.380> it's

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
working quite well where I mean it's

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.140 
working quite well where I mean it's
always<00:04:37.710> seems<00:04:37.979> to<00:04:38.070> be<00:04:38.190> entertaining<00:04:38.610> and<00:04:39.060> I

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
always seems to be entertaining and I

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.670 
always seems to be entertaining and I
guess<00:04:39.330> that's<00:04:39.510> what<00:04:39.659> we<00:04:39.690> have<00:04:39.900> to<00:04:40.050> put<00:04:40.200> it<00:04:40.320> put

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
guess that's what we have to put it put

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
guess that's what we have to put it put
it<00:04:40.740> down<00:04:40.950> to<00:04:40.979> is

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
it down to is

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.730 
it down to is
is<00:04:41.820> it<00:04:42.060> entertaining<00:04:42.480> to<00:04:42.690> our<00:04:42.810> fans<00:04:43.110> and<00:04:43.380> they

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
is it entertaining to our fans and they

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.310 
is it entertaining to our fans and they
seem<00:04:44.010> to<00:04:44.160> enjoy<00:04:44.310> it<00:04:44.700> because<00:04:45.110> you<00:04:46.110> know<00:04:46.200> it's

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
seem to enjoy it because you know it's

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.750 
seem to enjoy it because you know it's
always<00:04:46.470> not<00:04:46.710> the<00:04:46.800> same<00:04:46.980> people<00:04:47.310> winning<00:04:47.490> and

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
always not the same people winning and

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.160 
always not the same people winning and
then<00:04:47.880> there's<00:04:48.150> always<00:04:48.300> things<00:04:48.570> changing<00:04:49.080> in

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
then there's always things changing in

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.800 
then there's always things changing in
the<00:04:49.200> race<00:04:49.380> so<00:04:49.680> I<00:04:50.430> think<00:04:51.030> with<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.390> circuit

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
the race so I think with the circuit

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.630 
the race so I think with the circuit
itself<00:04:51.930> we<00:04:52.320> need<00:04:52.470> to<00:04:52.590> tweak<00:04:52.830> it<00:04:53.040> and<00:04:53.340> you<00:04:53.610> know

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
itself we need to tweak it and you know

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.270 
itself we need to tweak it and you know
I<00:04:53.760> guess<00:04:54.120> just<00:04:54.870> have<00:04:55.110> some<00:04:55.350> clear-cut<00:04:55.590> rule<00:04:56.010> so

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
I guess just have some clear-cut rule so

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.860 
I guess just have some clear-cut rule so
you<00:04:56.340> know<00:04:56.550> we<00:04:56.730> don't<00:04:56.850> have<00:04:57.000> blokes<00:04:57.330> cutting

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
you know we don't have blokes cutting

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.450 
you know we don't have blokes cutting
corners<00:04:58.110> and<00:04:58.500> things<00:04:58.710> like<00:04:58.860> that<00:04:58.920> and<00:04:59.070> I<00:04:59.430> think

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
corners and things like that and I think

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.250 
corners and things like that and I think
they<00:04:59.700> did<00:04:59.850> a<00:04:59.880> good<00:05:00.030> job<00:05:00.090> this<00:05:00.420> year<00:05:00.480> of<00:05:00.870> you

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
they did a good job this year of you

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.050 
they did a good job this year of you
know<00:05:01.350> fixing<00:05:01.710> the<00:05:01.830> back<00:05:01.980> chicane<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:02.670> things

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
know fixing the back chicane and things

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.090 
know fixing the back chicane and things
like<00:05:03.210> that<00:05:03.270> so<00:05:03.420> a<00:05:03.900> little<00:05:04.230> few<00:05:04.650> little<00:05:04.950> tweaks

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
like that so a little few little tweaks

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.130 
like that so a little few little tweaks
but<00:05:05.490> it's<00:05:05.550> definitely<00:05:06.210> one<00:05:06.570> of<00:05:06.600> the<00:05:06.750> events

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
but it's definitely one of the events

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.870 
but it's definitely one of the events
you<00:05:07.440> know<00:05:07.530> that<00:05:07.710> everyone<00:05:08.040> enjoys<00:05:08.190> going<00:05:08.640> to

think it highlights how good our drivers
are<00:05:20.550> and<00:05:20.730> our<00:05:20.820> teams<00:05:21.090> are<00:05:21.300> because<00:05:21.690> you<00:05:22.620> know
