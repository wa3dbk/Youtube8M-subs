background and while it is important to

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.429 
background and while it is important to
predict<00:01:18.479> where<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.689> enemy<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.049> coming<00:01:19.200> from

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.020 
always knew that there was a lot of
recoil<00:02:58.680> in<00:02:58.860> this<00:02:58.980> game<00:02:59.190> but<00:02:59.489> for<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.700> life<00:02:59.880> of

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
recoil in this game but for the life of

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.030 
recoil in this game but for the life of
me<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.180> could<00:03:00.570> never<00:03:00.750> compensate<00:03:01.530> for<00:03:01.739> it<00:03:01.890> I

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
me I could never compensate for it I

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.340 
me I could never compensate for it I
went<00:03:02.400> on<00:03:02.520> YouTube<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:03.330> try<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.600> understand

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
went on YouTube to try to understand

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.199 
went on YouTube to try to understand
where<00:03:04.739> to<00:03:04.890> point<00:03:05.070> and<00:03:05.250> click<00:03:05.340> at<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.640> enemy<00:03:06.030> I

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
where to point and click at the enemy I

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.810 
where to point and click at the enemy I
went<00:03:06.570> online<00:03:06.690> to<00:03:06.900> gifts<00:03:07.620> guides<00:03:07.890> but<00:03:08.340> nothing

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
went online to gifts guides but nothing

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.940 
went online to gifts guides but nothing
seemed<00:03:09.570> to<00:03:09.840> work<00:03:10.020> it<00:03:10.500> was<00:03:10.590> it<00:03:10.739> was<00:03:10.830> really

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
seemed to work it was it was really

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.500 
seemed to work it was it was really
frustrating<00:03:11.610> I<00:03:11.790> would<00:03:12.120> shoot<00:03:12.270> an<00:03:12.420> enemy

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
frustrating I would shoot an enemy

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.870 
frustrating I would shoot an enemy
downrange<00:03:13.350> I<00:03:13.709> would<00:03:13.860> assume<00:03:14.160> that<00:03:14.220> my<00:03:14.550> bullets

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
downrange I would assume that my bullets

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.280 
downrange I would assume that my bullets
were<00:03:15.030> landing<00:03:15.510> where<00:03:15.690> I<00:03:15.720> thought<00:03:16.020> they<00:03:16.230> were

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
were landing where I thought they were

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.199 
were landing where I thought they were
but<00:03:16.860> of<00:03:16.980> course<00:03:17.250> I<00:03:17.430> wasn't<00:03:17.730> getting<00:03:17.910> any<00:03:18.000> hits

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
but of course I wasn't getting any hits

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.630 
but of course I wasn't getting any hits
whatsoever<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.080> I<00:03:19.200> was<00:03:19.380> dying<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.830> lot<00:03:20.190> it<00:03:20.519> was

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
whatsoever and I was dying a lot it was

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.240 
whatsoever and I was dying a lot it was
incredibly<00:03:21.150> frustrating<00:03:21.560> then<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.590> found<00:03:22.890> this

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
incredibly frustrating then I found this

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.900 
incredibly frustrating then I found this
little<00:03:23.489> mod<00:03:23.820> and<00:03:24.209> my<00:03:24.480> life<00:03:24.780> changed<00:03:25.440> forever

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
little mod and my life changed forever

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.740 
little mod and my life changed forever
essentially<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:26.970> way<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.090> this<00:03:27.299> mod<00:03:27.510> works

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
essentially the way that this mod works

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.449 
essentially the way that this mod works
is<00:03:27.989> it<00:03:28.110> gives<00:03:28.230> you<00:03:28.350> a<00:03:28.410> wide<00:03:28.830> array<00:03:29.430> of

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
is it gives you a wide array of

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.370 
is it gives you a wide array of
different<00:03:29.850> guns<00:03:30.209> to<00:03:30.330> choose<00:03:30.570> from<00:03:30.900> I<00:03:31.049> mainly

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
different guns to choose from I mainly

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.320 
different guns to choose from I mainly
just<00:03:31.500> stuck<00:03:31.830> with<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.160> K<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:32.580> the<00:03:32.670> m4<00:03:33.060> and

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
just stuck with the a K and the m4 and

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.880 
just stuck with the a K and the m4 and
then<00:03:33.720> we<00:03:33.840> stand<00:03:34.019> in<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.260> center<00:03:34.530> of<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.739> map

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
then we stand in the center of the map

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.590 
then we stand in the center of the map
and<00:03:34.920> shoot<00:03:35.250> at<00:03:35.340> this<00:03:35.459> wall<00:03:35.670> not<00:03:36.209> only<00:03:36.450> does<00:03:36.570> it

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
and shoot at this wall not only does it

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.360 
and shoot at this wall not only does it
give<00:03:36.780> you<00:03:36.810> this<00:03:37.019> great<00:03:37.320> visual<00:03:37.709> indication<00:03:38.250> of

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
give you this great visual indication of

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.009 
give you this great visual indication of
where<00:03:38.640> your<00:03:38.820> bullets<00:03:39.120> are<00:03:39.209> landing<00:03:39.720> which<00:03:39.900> is

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
where your bullets are landing which is

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.590 
where your bullets are landing which is
awesome<00:03:40.470> but<00:03:40.950> it<00:03:41.040> also<00:03:41.190> has<00:03:41.489> this<00:03:42.000> indicator

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
awesome but it also has this indicator

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.270 
awesome but it also has this indicator
where<00:03:42.870> if<00:03:42.989> you<00:03:43.080> follow<00:03:43.320> with<00:03:43.500> your<00:03:43.650> crosshair

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
where if you follow with your crosshair

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.820 
where if you follow with your crosshair
it<00:03:44.790> will<00:03:44.970> allow<00:03:45.239> you<00:03:45.299> to<00:03:45.480> reel<00:03:45.870> in<00:03:46.080> that<00:03:46.110> recoil

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
it will allow you to reel in that recoil

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.550 
it will allow you to reel in that recoil
and<00:03:47.130> give<00:03:47.700> you<00:03:47.880> at<00:03:48.030> least<00:03:48.060> some<00:03:48.560> resemblance

incredibly helpful in allowing me to

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.170 
incredibly helpful in allowing me to
reel<00:04:25.530> in<00:04:25.740> that<00:04:25.950> recoil<00:04:26.460> and

reel in that recoil and

reel in that recoil and

this<00:04:37.289> was<00:04:37.470> a<00:04:37.500> gun<00:04:37.740> that<00:04:37.919> I<00:04:38.009> was<00:04:38.190> always

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
this was a gun that I was always

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.610 
this was a gun that I was always
hesitant<00:04:39.060> to<00:04:39.330> buy<00:04:39.600> because<00:04:39.990> well<00:04:40.289> first<00:04:40.500> of

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
hesitant to buy because well first of

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.960 
hesitant to buy because well first of
all<00:04:40.710> it's<00:04:40.889> an<00:04:41.009> incredible<00:04:41.520> amount<00:04:41.729> of<00:04:41.789> money

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
all it's an incredible amount of money

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.730 
all it's an incredible amount of money
and<00:04:42.210> I<00:04:42.509> never<00:04:42.750> wanted<00:04:43.169> to<00:04:43.320> give<00:04:43.470> it<00:04:43.560> to<00:04:43.650> the

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
and I never wanted to give it to the

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.409 
and I never wanted to give it to the
enemy<00:04:43.830> team<00:04:44.280> I<00:04:44.490> always<00:04:44.729> felt<00:04:44.970> like<00:04:45.090> I<00:04:45.240> wasn't

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
enemy team I always felt like I wasn't

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.180 
enemy team I always felt like I wasn't
gonna<00:04:45.600> get<00:04:45.750> enough<00:04:45.960> use<00:04:46.169> out<00:04:46.410> of<00:04:46.440> it<00:04:46.620> and<00:04:46.770> so<00:04:47.160> I

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
gonna get enough use out of it and so I

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.340 
gonna get enough use out of it and so I
kind<00:04:47.550> of<00:04:47.639> avoided<00:04:48.000> it<00:04:48.090> like<00:04:48.210> the<00:04:48.330> plague<00:04:48.570> then

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
kind of avoided it like the plague then

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.749 
kind of avoided it like the plague then
when<00:04:49.530> I<00:04:49.560> started<00:04:49.800> to<00:04:49.860> pick<00:04:50.009> up<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.400> enemy's

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 
when I started to pick up the enemy's

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:52.850 
when I started to pick up the enemy's
job<00:04:51.030> after<00:04:51.509> successfully<00:04:52.050> killing<00:04:52.229> them<00:04:52.590> and

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
job after successfully killing them and

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.650 
job after successfully killing them and
then<00:04:53.340> went<00:04:53.610> on<00:04:53.699> a<00:04:53.729> killing<00:04:53.820> where<00:04:54.389> I<00:04:54.419> killed

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
then went on a killing where I killed

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.710 
then went on a killing where I killed
like<00:04:54.780> four<00:04:55.050> people<00:04:55.289> in<00:04:55.470> a<00:04:55.530> row<00:04:55.560> as<00:04:55.889> I<00:04:56.220> would

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
like four people in a row as I would

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.200 
like four people in a row as I would
where<00:04:57.720> did<00:04:57.900> where<00:04:58.500> did<00:04:58.560> this<00:04:58.860> come<00:04:59.190> from<00:04:59.220> maybe

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
where did where did this come from maybe

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.390 
where did where did this come from maybe
I<00:05:00.419> should<00:05:00.870> start<00:05:01.289> to<00:05:01.680> use<00:05:01.949> this<00:05:02.160> more

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
I should start to use this more

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.550 
I should start to use this more
frequently<00:05:02.880> I<00:05:03.150> still<00:05:03.780> don't<00:05:03.990> buy<00:05:04.169> this<00:05:04.229> gun
