00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 there are very good youtube here about 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.130
 commenting and I bring you a video that 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.189
 I guess you're going to like the 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.389
 former call of duty players 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.250
 modern warfare 3 and we are in the new 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.769
 map of dome the remake is not exactly 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.450
 as it is called but good the names of 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.590
 the maps I'm bad enough for gone 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.660
 have to play a few times to 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.310
 learn me the so good here you have 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.560
 new to be seeing the name in the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.300
 title I suppose but I call it dome 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.980
 because it is exactly the same as the map 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.539
 of sun is some of the parts and good 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.840
 here you have a pain for teams with the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.690
 new app 90 that is the mink in fact the 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.719
 vision is called mink or something pp 99 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.910
 or pp 90 I do not remember but it's already 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.829
 updated on xbox now it's a beast 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.110
 brown or kill a lot now after 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.579
 of knowing that it would be a video to play 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.809
 the rifles and such that if you have not seen 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.219
 I'll leave it in the description for 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.820
 that you see, I suppose 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.260
 I'll leave in the other and well then you see 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.840
 know what the notice has improved not that 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.629
 it is a sovereign and absolute past, that is, 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.489
 now it kills a lot and as well 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.930
 I was testing and I also saw how many 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.239
 Americans a few Americans what 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.159
 they commented right now could be the 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.720
 better your pure rifle is to say was not 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.610
 avoid that regret the same is a little 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.290
 for long distances but for maps 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.450
 small mediums like for example can 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.600
 be this the dome or the maps 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.970
 old for example sovereign or extra 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.370
 did not because it is that there is no there is no 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.990
 reason to wear something other than 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.360
 the vision is that it kills a lot of 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.890
 three shots is very far away could 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.900
 to say that it has even better range 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.520
 that the app 90 of modern warfare 3 say 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.980
 which is better weapon right now than the app 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.420
 90 of modern warfare 3 and app 90 of 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.670
 modern warfare 3 as you know was the weapon 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.650
 which will use in competitive so good 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.180
 I already tell you that three bullets kill is 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.940
 quite far after four also 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.770
 one quite far and then already four 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.090
 and of five bullets even of six already 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.040
 quite pretty far but it's that the 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.590
 cadence that has is very beast is not 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.600
 I already tell you that he totally remembers the 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.580
 app 90 so in warfare 3 right now 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.960
 It is even a little better so I 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.340
 I recommend that you try it I have 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.380
 also for there are another 22 new maps 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.400
 with the vision but with silencer for 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.410
 that looks well how it works 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.080
 muffler and I also have a gameplay 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.340
 with music with the ccj or some of 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.200
 these new ones change updated also 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.700
 out there to upload it so I do not 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.959
 worry that I have a lot of 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.820
 examples of new maps as you are 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.350
 watching is a team idol 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.150
 me when new maps come out 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.370
 but I do not like to play for goals 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.530
 because all those who seek 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.390
 make streaks or seek to rally then 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.860
 it's much more fun to play hard because 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.330
 although it does not seem that maybe there is no 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.340
 objectives and people seem to be moving 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.230
 less but not the people move a 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.060
 little more than the objective and the maps 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.070
 new by objectives I never play 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.180
 that much is left disgusted limits 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.400
 already use a streak is a bit 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.350
 different from the one you usually use 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.790
 using the east missile that is divided 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.990
 in several new agreement as it was called 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.020
 right now 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.880
 then the kultur I think that the tap does not 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.620
 I think the tap is the one that 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.880
 you are driving you as you have seen and the 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.260
 puppy not that the puppy always comes 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.940
 well, I think it saves me once 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.620
 before when I was pulling the tap 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.510
 although they came after me, saved me once 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.860
 and it's a game that killed me 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.930
 they kill quite a bit the truth is that I 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.370
 I was angry because they killed me with a c4 and 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.510
 you know the stumbling block I have to the c4 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.540
 and good in what sometimes you have to 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.190
 eat and you even have to swallow but good 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.400
 tell you that also that yesterday if not no 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.890
 you saw upload one of the new maps the 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.330
 predictor streak that the good is not 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.010
 the projector as such as the modern 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.240
 warfare 3 but it is a new character 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.930
 a science fiction character that 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.150
 put there as an order 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.340
 and I also have pending I have a 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.599
 meets the see not me x that is achieved 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.000
 on this map good on this map there is a 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.400
 field order that comes out in three 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.739
 seekers that what they are called the way 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.239
 someone who are the ones that are exploited 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.219
 then as you throw the package is you 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.980
 You receive the briefcase to take out the order 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:40.329
 you look at the package and you get the bugs 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.530
 3 bugs come out who are going to look for 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.209
 enemies to exploit so they are 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.560
 basically three almost minimum lows 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.659
 insured unless the petÃ©n to 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.310
 distance as well as it has happened in the 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.959
 basically alien and then we have 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.760
 the bmx that would be a kind of interest 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.319
 and you will wonder what to do then 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.659
 good to be in a video specifically 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.060
 playing with her is worth apart from I do not know 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:01.030
 what are you playing with the map or with a 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.069
 rifle or whatever you have that you have me 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.260
 long that was right mine as well 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.090
 the arm holds a kind of 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.889
 platform and what you have to do is 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.389
 shoot to three stands that has 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:13.299
 above the arm that the one passing through 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:16.209
 rope to make it fall is to that 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:17.919
 module is to that kind of good if of 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.590
 module where is the bird do not x me catch it 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.690
 replace the exposed weapon 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.150
 just like the way someone shoots with 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.880
 the one to shoot and the one to aim 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.860
 you exploit the remaining ammunition and gas 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.900
 apart from the explosion, then 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.310
 a simple that also leaves a little 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.139
 fool the enemy so that's all in 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.370
 As for this map, you can also see that the 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.810
 part that I just went through now is 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.389
 a little different if you fix the minimap 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.760
 has a small route is a kind of 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.470
 l for so to better kill the 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.419
 champions that were put in the background the 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.310
 name that is mostly this map gave 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.510
 many problems those that stayed 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.820
 camping inside the house of the 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.220
 flag must but good I think with that 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.780
 route can even be improved so 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.919
 I hope you liked this video 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.889
 You liked it, you can leave it like 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.889
 favorites and subscribe for more goodbye
