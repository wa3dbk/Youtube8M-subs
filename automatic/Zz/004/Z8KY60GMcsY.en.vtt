00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
to do the care package elevating glitch

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.009 
to do the care package elevating glitch
to<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.490> glitch<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:27.180> will<00:00:27.269> need<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.480> be<00:00:27.779> an

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
to that glitch you will need to be an

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.230 
to that glitch you will need to be an
engineer<00:00:28.170> or<00:00:28.619> have<00:00:28.980> black<00:00:29.220> hat<00:00:29.490> because<00:00:30.060> you

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
engineer or have black hat because you

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.299 
engineer or have black hat because you
will<00:00:30.330> need<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.539> have<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:31.470> care<00:00:31.679> packages<00:00:32.130> that

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
will need to have to care packages that

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.590 
will need to have to care packages that
are<00:00:32.399> hacked<00:00:32.840> also<00:00:33.840> for<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.800> better<00:00:35.280> use<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.239> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
are hacked also for a better use of the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.090 
are hacked also for a better use of the
care<00:00:36.809> packages<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.530> want<00:00:37.710> them<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.980> be

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
care packages you want them to be

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.150 
care packages you want them to be
stacked<00:00:38.430> or<00:00:38.969> touching<00:00:39.870> because<00:00:40.500> if<00:00:40.860> they<00:00:41.040> are

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
stacked or touching because if they are

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.700 
stacked or touching because if they are
stacked<00:00:41.489> you'll<00:00:42.300> most<00:00:42.510> likely<00:00:42.710> levitate

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
stacked you'll most likely levitate

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.440 
stacked you'll most likely levitate
upward<00:00:44.160> instead<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.670> just<00:00:44.820> levitating

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
upward instead of just levitating

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.470 
upward instead of just levitating
another<00:00:46.170> way<00:00:46.410> so<00:00:47.129> one<00:00:47.280> through<00:00:47.550> stacked<00:00:47.879> just

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
another way so one through stacked just

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.119 
another way so one through stacked just
go<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> top<00:00:48.930> care<00:00:49.230> package<00:00:49.590> pick<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.010> up

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
go in the top care package pick it up

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.729 
go in the top care package pick it up
and<00:00:50.309> then<00:00:51.000> right<00:00:51.690> when<00:00:52.110> you're<00:00:52.350> about<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.530> go

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
and then right when you're about to go

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.619 
and then right when you're about to go
to<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.980> numbers<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.610> lighthouse<00:00:53.789> just

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
to the numbers of the lighthouse just

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.689 
to the numbers of the lighthouse just
jump<00:00:54.870> off<00:00:55.050> or<00:00:55.350> walk<00:00:55.530> off<00:00:55.770> depending<00:00:56.190> on<00:00:56.460> how

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
jump off or walk off depending on how
