00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
in the background the first time this

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.610 
in the background the first time this
time<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.370> maybe<00:00:51.180> let's<00:00:51.480> do<00:00:51.600> something<00:00:52.079> let's<00:00:52.500> do

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
time I maybe let's do something let's do

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.830 
time I maybe let's do something let's do
a<00:00:52.649> little<00:00:52.890> more<00:00:53.010> accurately<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.879> now<00:00:54.510> we're

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
a little more accurately and now we're

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.720 
a little more accurately and now we're
going<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.110> have<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.670> mound<00:00:58.010> from<00:00:59.010> from

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
going to have the the mound from from

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.270 
going to have the the mound from from
North<00:00:59.969> America<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.559> I'm<00:01:01.710> painting<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
North America and so I'm painting the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.630 
North America and so I'm painting the
the<00:01:02.489> mound<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:02.940> here<00:01:03.239> as<00:01:03.629> replacement<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.680> so

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
the mound in here as replacement and so

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.840 
the mound in here as replacement and so
this<00:01:06.540> will<00:01:06.780> be<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.770> much<00:01:08.400> more<00:01:08.610> active

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
this will be a much more active

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.950 
this will be a much more active
representation<00:01:09.750> than<00:01:10.530> what<00:01:10.710> I've<00:01:10.830> had<00:01:10.860> before

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.359 

but<00:01:15.960> I'm<00:01:16.080> really<00:01:16.229> excited<00:01:16.500> about<00:01:16.740> having<00:01:17.070> this

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
but I'm really excited about having this

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.030 
but I'm really excited about having this
type<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.759> painting<00:01:17.970> where<00:01:18.900> we<00:01:19.020> have<00:01:19.229> Christ

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
type of painting where we have Christ

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.940 
type of painting where we have Christ
and<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> children<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.930> 3rd<00:01:22.140> Nephi<00:01:22.350> seen

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
and the children and the 3rd Nephi seen

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.230 
and the children and the 3rd Nephi seen
but<00:01:23.250> not<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.700> South<00:01:24.299> America<00:01:24.869> but<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:26.000> Ohio<00:01:27.000> or

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
but not in South America but in Ohio or

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.030 
but not in South America but in Ohio or
Michigan<00:01:30.240> or<00:01:30.479> wherever<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.530> scene<00:01:31.770> had

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
Michigan or wherever this scene had

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.390 
Michigan or wherever this scene had
taken<00:01:32.280> place<00:01:32.960> now<00:01:33.960> these<00:01:34.140> are<00:01:34.350> wood<00:01:34.890> buildings

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
taken place now these are wood buildings

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.450 
taken place now these are wood buildings
and<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> grass<00:01:36.509> covered<00:01:37.049> Mound<00:01:38.009> and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
and this is a grass covered Mound and

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.929 
and this is a grass covered Mound and
then<00:01:39.420> these<00:01:39.630> would<00:01:39.840> be<00:01:39.990> steps<00:01:40.350> here<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:40.979> some

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
then these would be steps here and some

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.220 
then these would be steps here and some
trees<00:01:42.240> over<00:01:42.630> here<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:43.280> then

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
trees over here and then

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.400 
trees over here and then
I'm<00:01:45.440> gonna<00:01:45.740> put<00:01:46.010> of<00:01:46.330> the<00:01:47.330> poll<00:01:47.660> right<00:01:48.110> here

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
I'm gonna put of the poll right here

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.170 
I'm gonna put of the poll right here
then<00:01:48.680> there<00:01:48.800> also<00:01:48.920> some<00:01:49.370> other<00:01:49.520> polls<00:01:49.850> right

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
then there also some other polls right

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.800 
then there also some other polls right
here<00:01:50.540> I<00:01:50.570> think<00:01:51.730> we<00:01:52.730> could<00:01:52.910> have<00:01:53.180> there<00:01:53.660> was<00:01:53.780> a

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
here I think we could have there was a

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.600 
here I think we could have there was a
poll<00:01:54.140> here<00:01:54.440> then<00:01:55.430> this<00:01:55.550> is<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:55.790> outside<00:01:56.210> fence

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
poll here then this is the outside fence

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.160 
poll here then this is the outside fence
they<00:01:58.610> don't<00:01:58.790> know<00:01:58.910> exactly<00:01:59.330> how<00:01:59.570> they<00:01:59.840> the

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
they don't know exactly how they the

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.890 
they don't know exactly how they the
buildings<00:02:00.590> looked<00:02:01.000> they<00:02:02.000> figure<00:02:02.360> well<00:02:02.570> it<00:02:02.780> was

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
buildings looked they figure well it was

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.360 
buildings looked they figure well it was
probably<00:02:03.110> some<00:02:04.100> sort<00:02:04.370> of<00:02:04.480> patched<00:02:05.480> roof<00:02:05.960> and

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
probably some sort of patched roof and

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.520 
probably some sort of patched roof and
definitely<00:02:07.370> had<00:02:07.580> wood<00:02:08.050> fencing<00:02:09.050> and<00:02:09.290> wood

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.790 
posts on top of the on top of the mound
and<00:02:12.740> then<00:02:13.670> there<00:02:13.820> was<00:02:13.970> a<00:02:14.000> wood<00:02:14.450> staircase<00:02:15.320> here

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
and then there was a wood staircase here

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.080 
and then there was a wood staircase here

I tried to depict here is both Nephites
and<00:02:27.380> Lamanites

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
and Lamanites

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.380 
and Lamanites
and<00:02:28.160> so<00:02:29.060> I've<00:02:29.900> dressed<00:02:30.260> them<00:02:30.620> in<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:31.390> costumes

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
and so I've dressed them in a costumes

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.640 
and so I've dressed them in a costumes
that<00:02:32.540> I<00:02:32.570> think<00:02:32.780> are<00:02:32.900> probably<00:02:33.080> appropriate

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
that I think are probably appropriate

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.790 
that I think are probably appropriate
for<00:02:33.830> either<00:02:34.070> Nephites<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.180> Lamanites<00:02:35.500> but<00:02:36.500> on

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
for either Nephites and Lamanites but on

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.290 
for either Nephites and Lamanites but on
this<00:02:37.040> particular<00:02:37.190> painting<00:02:37.820> I<00:02:37.880> wanted<00:02:38.180> it

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
this particular painting I wanted it

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.140 
this particular painting I wanted it
just<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.630> focus<00:02:38.840> on<00:02:39.110> Christ<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:40.160> and<00:02:40.610> the

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
just to focus on Christ and and the

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.550 
just to focus on Christ and and the
children<00:02:41.510> here<00:02:41.750> and<00:02:41.840> with<00:02:42.020> the<00:02:42.110> light<00:02:42.290> coming

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
children here and with the light coming

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.760 
children here and with the light coming
in<00:02:42.770> from<00:02:42.800> the<00:02:43.010> side<00:02:43.330> giving<00:02:44.330> it<00:02:44.450> a

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
in from the side giving it a

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.580 
in from the side giving it a
three-dimensional<00:02:45.770> look<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.460> it
