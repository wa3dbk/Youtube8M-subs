00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
who else is so I have a basis drawn

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.740 
who else is so I have a basis drawn
underneath<00:00:14.130> it<00:00:15.020> from<00:00:16.020> tests<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.699> zoomed<00:00:18.539> in

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
underneath it from tests so zoomed in

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.390 
underneath it from tests so zoomed in
and<00:00:18.990> basically<00:00:19.500> now<00:00:19.800> what<00:00:20.010> we're<00:00:20.189> going<00:00:20.340> to

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
and basically now what we're going to

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
and basically now what we're going to
start<00:00:20.670> off<00:00:20.880> with<00:00:21.270> doing<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.350> basic<00:00:22.859> shape<00:00:23.420> of

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
start off with doing the basic shape of

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.050 
start off with doing the basic shape of
her<00:00:24.630> face<00:00:25.070> I'm<00:00:26.070> not<00:00:26.310> going<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.519> be<00:00:26.609> doing<00:00:26.789> any

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
her face I'm not going to be doing any

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.560 
her face I'm not going to be doing any
facial<00:00:27.930> features<00:00:28.590> because<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.880> just<00:00:30.449> a

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
facial features because this is just a

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.150 
facial features because this is just a
treat<00:00:30.869> or<00:00:31.170> tutorial<00:00:32.160> on<00:00:32.790> her<00:00:33.300> hair<00:00:34.070> so<00:00:35.070> now

treat or tutorial on her hair so now
we'll<00:00:35.280> just<00:00:35.309> do<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.670> basis<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.710> and<00:00:37.710> then

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
we'll just do the basis that and then

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.810 
we'll just do the basis that and then
she<00:00:38.550> always<00:00:38.670> has<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.090> like<00:00:40.309> it<00:00:41.309> which<00:00:41.520> comes

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
she always has that like it which comes

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.720 
she always has that like it which comes
off<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.239> make<00:00:42.390> sure<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.570> draw<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.730> okay

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
off so make sure to draw that in okay

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.930 
off so make sure to draw that in okay
now<00:00:44.760> what<00:00:45.000> we're<00:00:45.180> gonna<00:00:45.270> do<00:00:46.280> just<00:00:47.280> bring<00:00:47.579> this

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
now what we're gonna do just bring this

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.119 
now what we're gonna do just bring this
round<00:00:48.420> do<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.680> basic<00:00:50.190> shape<00:00:51.680> and<00:00:52.680> then<00:00:52.829> bring

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
round do the basic shape and then bring

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.840 
round do the basic shape and then bring
it<00:00:53.160> round<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:54.379> making<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.559> smaller<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.789> is

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
it round so making it smaller this is

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.200 
it round so making it smaller this is
gonna<00:00:57.059> be<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.329> braid<00:00:58.309> okay<00:00:59.309> if<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.030> don't

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
gonna be the braid okay if you don't

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.090 
gonna be the braid okay if you don't
know<00:01:00.300> how<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.480> do<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.719> braid<00:01:01.050> then<00:01:01.590> watch

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
know how to do a braid then watch

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.420 
know how to do a braid then watch
closely<00:01:02.690> so<00:01:03.690> what<00:01:03.960> you're<00:01:04.080> gonna<00:01:04.229> do<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.650> go

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
closely so what you're gonna do is go

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.990 
closely so what you're gonna do is go
about<00:01:05.850> just<00:01:06.540> blow<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.020> air<00:01:07.460> and<00:01:08.460> then<00:01:08.729> draw

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
about just blow the air and then draw

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.820 
about just blow the air and then draw
zigzag<00:01:10.460> down<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.850> middle<00:01:12.380> and<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.619> goes

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
zigzag down the middle and it goes

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.200 
zigzag down the middle and it goes
smaller<00:01:14.900> as<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.080> comes<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.530> okay<00:01:17.159> know<00:01:18.030> what

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
smaller as it comes it okay know what

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.800 
smaller as it comes it okay know what
you<00:01:18.299> can<00:01:18.450> do<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.840> want<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.200> link<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:20.659> to<00:01:21.659> make

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
you can do is want to link this to make

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.800 
you can do is want to link this to make
lines<00:01:25.009> like<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.490> then<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.479> want<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.689> do

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
lines like that and then you want to do

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.300 
lines like that and then you want to do
the<00:01:27.960> same<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.470> other<00:01:28.500> side<00:01:31.040> and<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.130> can

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
the same on the other side and you can

the same on the other side and you can
read<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.549> see<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.820> have<00:01:33.030> your<00:01:33.329> basic<00:01:33.840> plot

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
read you see you have your basic plot

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.359 
read you see you have your basic plot
okay<00:01:36.360> now<00:01:36.810> what<00:01:37.049> you're<00:01:37.200> gonna<00:01:37.320> do<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:38.070> piece

these cabbie better to make it more like
a<00:01:50.880> braid<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:52.280> can<00:01:53.280> do<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.549> more<00:01:53.909> step-by-step

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
a braid I can do a more step-by-step

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.969 
a braid I can do a more step-by-step
guide<00:01:56.090> and<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.180> braid<00:01:57.450> really<00:01:57.960> go<00:01:58.170> close-up<00:01:58.770> on

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
guide and a braid really go close-up on

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.639 
guide and a braid really go close-up on
deliver<00:01:59.610> aid<00:02:00.439> and<00:02:01.439> now<00:02:01.710> we're<00:02:01.860> just<00:02:01.950> gonna

deliver aid and now we're just gonna

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.499 
deliver aid and now we're just gonna
erase

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:15.940 

these<00:02:08.509> lines<00:02:08.810> and<00:02:09.110> then<00:02:09.200> go<00:02:09.440> over<00:02:09.590> again<00:02:14.950> I'm

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
these lines and then go over again I'm

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.710 
these lines and then go over again I'm
gonna<00:02:16.100> put<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.430> little<00:02:16.930> elastic<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.880> then<00:02:19.880> has
