let's<00:00:25.260> see<00:00:25.470> first<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.849> made<00:00:27.300> myself<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:28.019> divining

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
let's see first I made myself a divining

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.030 
let's see first I made myself a divining
rod<00:00:28.560> as<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.760> can<00:00:29.910> see<00:00:30.060> here<00:00:30.590> let's<00:00:31.590> check<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
rod as you can see here let's check the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.220 
rod as you can see here let's check the
recipes<00:00:33.680> it's<00:00:34.680> from<00:00:35.160> covalence<00:00:35.730> dust<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.390> one

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
recipes it's from covalence dust and one

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.940 
recipes it's from covalence dust and one
stick<00:00:37.559> for<00:00:38.399> basic<00:00:39.180> divining<00:00:39.600> rod<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.079> from

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
stick for basic divining rod and from

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.500 
stick for basic divining rod and from
basic<00:00:41.309> training<00:00:41.399> grant<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.120> make<00:00:42.980> the<00:00:44.239> CN<00:00:45.239> i

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
basic training grant to make the CN i

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.400 
basic training grant to make the CN i
think<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.620> color<00:00:47.420> uh<00:00:48.420> next<00:00:48.960> level<00:00:49.289> of

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
think it's the color uh next level of

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.770 
think it's the color uh next level of
the<00:00:49.590> divining<00:00:50.160> rod<00:00:52.129> for<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.280> recipes<00:00:53.969> well<00:00:54.539> as

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
the divining rod for the recipes well as

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.459 
the divining rod for the recipes well as
you<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.170> see<00:00:55.230> they<00:00:55.559> are<00:00:55.590> very<00:00:56.100> simple<00:00:56.489> and

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
you can see they are very simple and

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.420 
you can see they are very simple and
this<00:00:58.469> divining<00:00:58.859> rod<00:00:59.070> basically<00:00:59.870> helps<00:01:00.870> you

next video I will focus more on a query

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.450 
next video I will focus more on a query
and<00:05:26.810> different<00:05:27.810> BuildCraft<00:05:28.680> engines<00:05:29.160> and

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
maybe even induced circuit if i will be

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.850 
maybe even induced circuit if i will be
able<00:05:31.980> to<00:05:32.400> find<00:05:32.550> some<00:05:32.790> level<00:05:33.090> and<00:05:33.750> that's<00:05:34.650> it

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
able to find some level and that's it

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.760 
able to find some level and that's it
