00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.179
 I'll start from now on with the 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.070
 mayor andré gadelha who will discuss 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.619
 on the problem of the marizão stadium 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.260
 the work is embargoed there is a discussion 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.170
 on this subject including the state 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.590
 accuses the municipality of not passing on a 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.900
 loan agreement on this 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.060
 subject is going to speak the mayor 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.099
 who really has in relation to 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.880
 stadium problem the marizão 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:40.700
 unfortunately the information reaches 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:44.610
 in a form is different from reality 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:48.570
 when they came to me to make the 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.700
 reform of the Marist stadium by invitation 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.670
 invited by the state government then 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.980
 made solemn present the investment 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.699
 one million two million and six hundred 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:03.750
 thousand reais and then I witness so 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.700
 nor that one that signature of the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.939
 order of service so that the company 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.780
 start work is in the marizão 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.570
 I'm a sousa fan I come 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.409
 helping souza as the law dictates 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.720
 always talk to the village president 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.240
 cordially investing in the stadium 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.299
 to receive the Northeast Cup for 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.310
 To receive the cup from Brazil is really the goal. 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.850
 of Brazil in the match against against 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.850
 Coritiba the game against the sport reef 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.220
 We did renovations from day to night to 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.890
 that the stadium could receive the supporter 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.640
 I've always done my part as a manager 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.490
 now when I was called by the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.159
 secretary ricardo barbosa where he 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.470
 I would call on a Friday night where I 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.780
 would have to sign a document the parts 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.210
 for the governor to achieve 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.180
 resources with the bnds 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.909
 At that moment I asked the 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.540
 clerk if the money of the 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.209
 it was the same money as the central market 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.860
 because the covenant that was denied the wind 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.080
 was the agreement denied the city hall 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.570
 de sousa in the amount of three million 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.640
 900 thousand for the reform of the market I 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.060
 that those resources that were already 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.340
 had been earmarked for the 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.460
 reform of the marizão stadium and 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.050
 with the difference of money 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.690
 because it was an investment of 3,900 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.480
 I was making 12 600 and he was telling me 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.130
 that's not the Marist stadium, that's 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.100
 built with bnds features 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.320
 needed this document as a matter of urgency and 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.960
 I asked you to send an email to 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.600
 me and so sent me a secretary and 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.270
 mail but sent a copy of a copy of 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.970
 an agreement for an assignment of use that was 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:55.830
 made in cajazeiras where the city hall 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:59.880
 passes the stadium to the usufruct 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:02.220
 the state government for 20 years and 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.800
 Same time I spoke with the secretary said 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.310
 that it would not do so in any way 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.820
 which I could offer to the stadium at 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.850
 state was that the stadium be used 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:18.600
 for retirement with bnds money by 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:23.940
 period of construction that he sent the 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:26.250
 contract that would use the stadium for time 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.110
 by construction schedule two months 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.350
 to be even a year and a half 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.200
 soon after the reform the stadium voted 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.410
 to the municipality without any problem 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.410
 until then I did not receive this document and 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:44.600
 I'm waiting for another one and a half 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:47.220
 secretary of Ricardo barbosa and asking 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.709
 that I make a covenant or an act 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.480
 administrative agreement is signed with the 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.970
 staff responsible for managing and 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.010
 intervention where they are not of the 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:01.260
 weakness of the beneficiary 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:05.910
 I'm only going to do this act when the state 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:08.760
 to send this contract is an exchange is 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.980
 with this because the state government 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.870
 also has other means to 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.269
 to be able to make an exchange, so let's 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.760
 that you want and look no, I do not want 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:21.330
 things go hand in hand with the 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.109
 another but parallel I go 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.880
 solve 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.680
 there was the problem of 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.410
 an injury when he tells me 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.320
 send today I'll sign today 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.780
 now what I asked the secretary to 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.210
 he could help us 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.550
 on account of the exhibition park 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:42.840
 example is one of the requests of the municipality 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:45.180
 causes the state to pass the use of the 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.550
 park solution for the municipality so that 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.460
 we can do a project of one 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.260
 great event place for souza 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.080
 we all know that the pac exposure 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.600
 been closed for many years and I asked 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.970
 for him to lend this 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.940
 assignment of use with the municipality until then 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:07.800
 I did not receive a reply you also made a request 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:10.290
 to the state there is the use of cs upra that we 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:14.460
 we can build a center there 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:18.390
 administration of the prefecture and is to 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:21.360
 that soccer field lawn illuminate 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:25.020
 go for a bit of amateur sport inside 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.180
 of marizão and take process and we have 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.240
 resources already secured 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.250
 it is through the deputy leonardo gadelha 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.200
 resources to cover a court and the 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.810
 success has a block discovered 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.240
 side we could cover that 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:43.320
 to transform into gymnasium and even 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:45.960
 So I did not get answers, so it 's me. 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.340
 I do my part I hope the government 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.220
 do your part 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:53.580
 now you create untruthful information 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:56.280
 to is without the truth of the facts is very 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:59.010
 because the power of the government of the 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.930
 state in the media is very large but 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.850
 This is true for everyone who 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.220
 assists through the sites that 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.380
 listen through the radios that the truth 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.400
 this is the one we are ready to do 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.910
 partnerships 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:14.070
 now it has to be with responsibility and 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:17.540
 I will not do anything to 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.540
 prejudice the municipality of sousa
