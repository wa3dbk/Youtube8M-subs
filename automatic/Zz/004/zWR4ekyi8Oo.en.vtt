I've had for this antenna for a long
time<00:00:46.160> I<00:00:47.160> thought<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.789> friend<00:00:48.030> was<00:00:48.300> going<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.629> use

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
time I thought a friend was going to use

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.869 
time I thought a friend was going to use
it<00:00:48.809> but<00:00:49.200> he<00:00:49.289> ended<00:00:49.530> up<00:00:49.649> not<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.219> I've<00:00:50.399> had<00:00:50.640> this

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
it but he ended up not and I've had this

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.569 
it but he ended up not and I've had this
probably<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.449> year<00:00:51.840> or<00:00:51.930> two<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.129> probably

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
probably a year or two this is probably

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.680 
probably a year or two this is probably
my<00:00:54.030> favorite<00:00:54.739> euro<00:00:55.739> part<00:00:56.210> well<00:00:57.210> looky<00:00:57.660> there

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690

my favorite euro part well looky there
this<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.199> probably<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.829> first<00:00:59.010> antenna<00:00:59.609> that

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
this is probably the first antenna that

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.599 
this is probably the first antenna that
I've<00:01:00.000> ever<00:01:00.210> taken<00:01:00.539> apart<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.949> wasn't

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
I've ever taken apart that wasn't

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.109

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
antenna mass intact and here's the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.219 
antenna mass intact and here's the
inside<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.520> motor<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.630> had<00:01:12.869> somehow

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
inside of the motor and it had somehow

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.710 
inside of the motor and it had somehow
come<00:01:13.710> loose<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.340> I'm<00:01:14.970> gonna<00:01:15.090> put<00:01:15.299> this<00:01:15.479> back

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.090 
come loose so I'm gonna put this back
together<00:01:16.100> tighten<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.189> up<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.610> then<00:01:17.810> I'm<00:01:18.810> a

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100

little seals inside the connectors you
got<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.799> make<00:02:04.979> sure<00:02:05.130> those<00:02:05.310> seals<00:02:05.670> didn't<00:02:06.060> fall

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
got to make sure those seals didn't fall

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:06.859

off

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
off

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.169 
off
so<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.740> get<00:02:07.950> your<00:02:08.129> connectors<00:02:08.729> on<00:02:08.940> good

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
so that you get your connectors on good

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.710 
so that you get your connectors on good
and<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.989> can<00:02:10.200> put<00:02:10.410> some<00:02:10.590> dialectic

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
and you can put some dialectic

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.150 
and you can put some dialectic
electrical<00:02:12.720> grease<00:02:12.959> on<00:02:13.170> those<00:02:13.560> too

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
electrical grease on those too

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.630

so<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:14.819> you<00:02:14.970> get<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.180> good<00:02:15.450> seal<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:16.400> no<00:02:17.400> dirt

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
so that you get a good seal and no dirt

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.979 
so that you get a good seal and no dirt
or<00:02:17.849> water<00:02:17.970> gets<00:02:18.360> in<00:02:18.510> there<00:02:18.540> on<00:02:18.840> there
