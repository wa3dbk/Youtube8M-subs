finger<00:02:05.540> so<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.630> can<00:02:06.810> go<00:02:06.960> like<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.410> it's

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
finger so you can go like this and it's

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.330 
finger so you can go like this and it's
like<00:02:07.980> chomping<00:02:09.290> then<00:02:10.290> what<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.560> do<00:02:10.710> is<00:02:10.950> you

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
like chomping then what you do is you

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.210 
like chomping then what you do is you
take<00:02:11.370> your<00:02:11.850> thumb<00:02:12.480> with<00:02:12.780> your<00:02:12.960> pinky<00:02:13.470> but<00:02:14.100> you

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
take your thumb with your pinky but you

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.930 
take your thumb with your pinky but you
take<00:02:14.430> your<00:02:14.670> thumb<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.330> you<00:02:15.630> lift<00:02:15.960> up<00:02:16.940> another

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
take your thumb and you lift up another

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.150 
take your thumb and you lift up another
third<00:02:18.570> of<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.900> deck<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:19.590> then<00:02:19.770> when<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:20.010> go

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
third of the deck so then when you go

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.520 
third of the deck so then when you go
out<00:02:20.340> it<00:02:20.640> expands<00:02:21.330> it's<00:02:21.900> almost<00:02:22.230> like<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.890> Z<00:02:24.530> okay

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
out it expands it's almost like a Z okay

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.860 
out it expands it's almost like a Z okay
so<00:02:25.590> now<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.100> have<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.400> three<00:02:26.640> packets<00:02:27.180> now

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
so now you have the three packets now

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.870 
so now you have the three packets now
the<00:02:27.930> top<00:02:28.320> packet<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.190> one<00:02:29.340> you're<00:02:29.490> holding<00:02:29.520> in

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
the top packet the one you're holding in

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.790 
the top packet the one you're holding in
your<00:02:29.910> right<00:02:30.180> hand<00:02:30.210> you<00:02:31.170> rotate<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:32.040> down<00:02:32.910> and

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
your right hand you rotate that down and

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.110 
your right hand you rotate that down and
then<00:02:34.800> when<00:02:34.920> you're<00:02:35.010> doing<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:35.490> the<00:02:35.820> middle

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
then when you're doing that the middle

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.080 
then when you're doing that the middle
packet<00:02:36.570> should<00:02:36.780> come<00:02:37.020> up<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.490> the<00:02:38.490> one<00:02:38.700> the

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
packet should come up and the one the

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.000 
packet should come up and the one the
packet<00:02:40.020> you're<00:02:40.140> holding<00:02:40.470> in<00:02:40.590> your<00:02:40.620> left<00:02:40.920> hand

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
packet you're holding in your left hand

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.280 
packet you're holding in your left hand
should<00:02:41.370> also<00:02:41.520> come<00:02:41.910> down<00:02:42.120> at<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.480> same<00:02:42.720> angle

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
should also come down at the same angle

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.670 
should also come down at the same angle
as<00:02:43.760> your<00:02:44.760> right<00:02:45.000> hand<00:02:45.360> so<00:02:46.320> i'm<00:02:46.380> going<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.590> show

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
off a card just like this hopefully you

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.100 
off a card just like this hopefully you
can<00:03:54.870> see<00:03:55.140> that<00:03:55.350> you<00:03:56.070> pull<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.550> and<00:03:56.730> pull<00:03:57.420> until

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
you get to about here

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.200 
you get to about here
you<00:04:01.460> rotate<00:04:01.910> it<00:04:02.060> up

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.210 
you rotate it up

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.570 
you rotate it up
and<00:04:04.390> rest<00:04:04.930> it<00:04:05.080> on<00:04:05.170> your<00:04:05.230> pinky<00:04:05.830> with<00:04:06.190> your<00:04:06.370> left
