00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.230
 I'm going to prepare a thousand leaves of meringue 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.589
 a recipe that I'm going to dedicate to 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:17.950
 appointment that he asked me for some elaborated dessert 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:22.300
 with merengue and this time it's going to 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:26.980
 make a strudel for it we need 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:32.910
 puff pastry sugar a pinch of 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:35.850
 salt four clear icing sugar and one egg 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.360
 the first step is to make a syrup 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.680
 strong for this we have put here in 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:47.550
 a pan 300 grams of sugar the 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.850
 another 100 grams we reserve for 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.539
 use them later 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.210
 Now we are going to cover this sugar 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:01:00.030
 justito justito with water is to say that 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.250
 let's see that everything gets wet but not 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.250
 exceeds water to sugar 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:13.670
 we already have the short sugar by the 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.740
 water now we 're going to have it boiling 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.439
 principle we are going to remove it so that it 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.049
 Dissolve the sugar well and we will have it 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:23.420
 boiling until we check that it is 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.830
 about to evra 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.220
 later I will show you how 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.640
 must be time now 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.640
 boil 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.630
 I'll go seeing about 10 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.500
 Minutitos our syrup 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:45.300
 Now what is on a plate is to put 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:49.870
 two droplets of the syrup 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:54.330
 and then joining the two fingers 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:57.900
 you see how a royal thread forms 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.300
 that's because you're about to evra like that 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.630
 that now we 're going to turn it off 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:07.610
 we have separated the whites from the earth 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.340
 and we have in this container the four 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.880
 clear to which we are going to put a 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.160
 little pinch of salt with it we get that 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.350
 mount better 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.100
 Now let's ride the egg whites 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:25.400
 of snow we have put the pinch of salt 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:28.910
 so with the mounting rods we're going 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.130
 to climb the already almost have mounted the 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.980
 clear to the point of snow now we are going to 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.370
 incorporate the 100 grams of sugar and 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:41.360
 we will continue beating until it is 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:45.170
 well express and there is the clear one we already have 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.440
 the whites mounted hard and now 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.920
 the syrup we had is going to go 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.810
 adding little by little with a trickle 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.830
 finite 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.050
 to our our meringue and 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.360
 we will continue beating second and we give 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:06.730
 the syrup has to look good 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.900
 so to beat 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.860
 we have finished our meringue 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.610
 checking that we have it right 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.100
 mounted 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:20.160
 we overturn 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:23.910
 we overturn and you see it does not fall 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:27.180
 and other checks 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:30.800
 that you attend on the rods you saw that 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:35.690
 they give a kind of beak and we slip 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.690
 Well, that's well commented 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:43.030
 I can assure you it 's delicious why 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.940
 Well, because I've taken with a spoon 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.430
 he is already dead 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.490
 now we will reserve it until we mount 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.250
 and our millefeuille you see that it is fabulous 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.060
 merengue because I can do many 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.060
 elaborations 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:09.860
 to prepare the puff pastry we have 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:12.019
 unwrapped the little one and now with 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.830
 icing sugar let's sprinkle the 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:17.959
 surface we will turn around and for the 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.979
 another side also sprinkle we have 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:24.050
 icing sugar to sweeten the puff pastry 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:26.320
 we have preheating the oven to 200 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.320
 degrees 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.400
 once we have sprinkled with sugar 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.040
 glas on both sides the mass of 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.100
 puff pastry we put it on the plate 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:41.340
 oven and let helping a fork 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.550
 to prick the entire surface well 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.120
 that it would come out when baked it does not rise for 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.910
 that we have left planito 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.660
 if we see during the baking that is 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:55.950
 inflates , then nothing opens the door and 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.990
 we click again 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:01.110
 teacher when preheating the oven 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:05.040
 at 200 degrees we will introduce the plate and 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:07.250
 we will have about 15 minutes or 18 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.250
 approximately 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.900
 the puff pastry in the oven but good as 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:15.139
 It depends on each oven when you see that 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.689
 it's golden we'll take it out 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:20.090
 we just took out the puff pastry from the oven 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:23.030
 you can see how golden and has not 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:26.630
 up just now we will let it cool 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.760
 to assemble then our own hash 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:32.420
 I forgot to tell you that you can 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:35.870
 paint the puff surface with 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:37.760
 I beaten egg before putting it in the oven at 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.380
 me this time I forgot 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.280
 but you see that the color 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:46.430
 still with everything is beautiful so now 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.040
 let's let it cool once 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.910
 we have puff pastry cold with a knife 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.110
 of saw 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:56.630
 let's go for making it into pieces 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.790
 how we want it to be two thousand sheets or 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.790
 good rectangles or circles 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.830
 helping me with a crop cutter I'm going to 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.550
 like everyone 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.590
 I started making strips 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.540
 verticals and now I'm going to make a 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:15.020
 horizontal cut 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:18.409
 well the term more or less than 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:20.929
 we calculate that it is joining leaves 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:24.349
 finally to assemble the thousand sheets 

00:06:20.929 --> 00:06:27.860
 we put a rectangle of which we have 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:31.370
 base puff pastry cut on top 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:35.300
 we put a good amount of meringue 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:38.020
 and on it we put another capita of 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.020
 puff pastry 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:45.040
 now with a spatula we will fill 

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:48.130
 well all the sides so that it is 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:51.820
 very nice and with this we had already 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:56.430
 mounted a puff pastry sheet and 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.430
 here we have already assembled several thousand sheets 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:03.090
 It is convenient to leave them in the fridge 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:06.020
 so that the meringue 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:10.180
 a little bit is shared 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:12.310
 and what I have done is with a colander 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:16.350
 sprinkle over the puff pastry 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:19.310
 icing sugar to make it more beautiful 

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:22.230
 then you see how our 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:25.700
 leaves 

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.700
 and we wanted
