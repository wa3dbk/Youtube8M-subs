00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
down and you can see the distance from

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.760 
down and you can see the distance from
the<00:00:34.170> string<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.980> top<00:00:36.410> of<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.590> hip

rafter<00:00:40.910> it<00:00:41.910> goes<00:00:42.149> up<00:00:42.420> about<00:00:44.300> this<00:00:45.300> thickness

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
rafter it goes up about this thickness

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.590 
rafter it goes up about this thickness
for<00:00:46.320> about<00:00:47.570> 93<00:00:48.570> inches<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.350> measured<00:00:50.600> took

for about 93 inches that I measured took

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.279 
for about 93 inches that I measured took
some<00:00:51.870> sheathing<00:00:52.230> I'm<00:00:52.829> going<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.430> place

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
sheathing under the string filling that

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.450 
sheathing under the string filling that
gap<00:00:59.430> there<00:01:00.079> good<00:01:01.109> okay<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:01.949> I'll<00:01:02.129> put<00:01:02.340> this

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.510 
to fill in the gap from the string that
I<00:01:12.720> had<00:01:12.990> drawn<00:01:13.320> from<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.340> peak<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.830> of<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
I had drawn from the peak of the of the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.550 
I had drawn from the peak of the of the
hip<00:01:17.759> roof<00:01:18.229> down

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.710 

to<00:01:24.040> the<00:01:24.159> bottom

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.149 

the<00:01:28.320> gap<00:01:28.590> was

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:38.289 

from<00:01:31.729> 91<00:01:32.270> inches<00:01:32.510> was<00:01:33.200> was<00:01:33.680> just<00:01:33.710> about<00:01:37.299> the

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
from 91 inches was was just about the

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.340 
from 91 inches was was just about the
thickness<00:01:38.930> of<00:01:39.200> a<00:01:39.320> piece<00:01:39.560> of<00:01:39.740> sheeting<00:01:41.170> so<00:01:42.170> that

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
thickness of a piece of sheeting so that

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.070 
thickness of a piece of sheeting so that
worked<00:01:42.560> out<00:01:42.740> pretty<00:01:42.799> well<00:01:43.070> for<00:01:43.220> me<00:01:43.630> and<00:01:44.630> you

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080

them<00:03:37.750> sections<00:03:38.750> of<00:03:38.900> about<00:03:39.140> one<00:03:39.859> and<00:03:39.950> a<00:03:40.010> half

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
them sections of about one and a half

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.539 
them sections of about one and a half
inch<00:03:40.459> to<00:03:40.820> go<00:03:41.540> over<00:03:41.930> just<00:03:43.690> to<00:03:44.690> buy<00:03:44.930> eight<00:03:45.549> hip

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
inch to go over just to buy eight hip

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.890 
inch to go over just to buy eight hip
rafter<00:03:47.540> and<00:03:48.430> I'm<00:03:49.430> just<00:03:49.609> gonna<00:03:49.790> continue<00:03:50.600> to

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
rafter and I'm just gonna continue to

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.420 
rafter and I'm just gonna continue to
fill<00:03:51.170> in<00:03:51.350> I'm<00:03:51.500> probably<00:03:51.769> going<00:03:52.010> to<00:03:52.100> leave<00:03:52.220> some

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
fill in I'm probably going to leave some

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.069 
fill in I'm probably going to leave some
gaps<00:03:52.459> here<00:03:54.760> yeah<00:03:55.760> II<00:03:55.790> think<00:03:56.630> is<00:03:56.780> going<00:03:56.930> to<00:03:56.989> be

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
gaps here yeah II think is going to be

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.800 
gaps here yeah II think is going to be
covering<00:03:57.560> this<00:03:58.069> so<00:03:58.880> it<00:03:59.000> just<00:03:59.209> needs<00:03:59.269> to

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
covering this so it just needs to

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:07.770 
covering this so it just needs to
support<00:04:00.500> the<00:04:00.650> sheathing<00:04:00.920> and

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.790 

so<00:04:08.590> that's<00:04:08.800> what<00:04:09.070> I'm<00:04:09.190> doing<00:04:10.410> you<00:04:11.410> know<00:04:11.440> that

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
so that's what I'm doing you know that

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.780 
so that's what I'm doing you know that
it<00:04:12.460> gets<00:04:12.990> smaller<00:04:13.990> and<00:04:14.320> smaller<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.950> gap<00:04:15.460> does

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
it gets smaller and smaller the gap does

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.740 
it gets smaller and smaller the gap does
is<00:04:15.940> it<00:04:16.090> goes<00:04:16.269> up<00:04:17.519> so<00:04:18.519> I<00:04:18.549> just<00:04:18.880> have<00:04:19.120> to<00:04:19.150> fill<00:04:19.570> it

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
is it goes up so I just have to fill it

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:28.280 
is it goes up so I just have to fill it
in<00:04:25.020> this<00:04:26.020> one<00:04:26.260> will<00:04:26.380> probably<00:04:26.560> take<00:04:27.070> two

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
in this one will probably take two

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.330 
in this one will probably take two
little<00:04:29.290> cuts<00:04:29.650> here<00:04:31.350> then<00:04:32.350> I'll<00:04:32.470> stop<00:04:32.950> right

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
little cuts here then I'll stop right

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.850 
little cuts here then I'll stop right
where<00:04:33.640> the<00:04:33.760> string<00:04:34.530> touches<00:04:37.530> about<00:04:38.530> right

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
where the string touches about right

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.840 
where the string touches about right
there

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.630 

maybe<00:04:42.850> I'll<00:04:43.030> feeling<00:04:43.540> a<00:04:43.600> little<00:04:43.750> bit<00:04:44.020> here

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.100 

I've<00:04:48.640> looked<00:04:48.910> all<00:04:49.030> over<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.450> internet<00:04:49.810> for<00:04:50.020> a

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:45.409 
after that next I can start on this part

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:48.429 
after that next I can start on this part
of<00:06:45.559> the<00:06:45.739> hip<00:06:46.129> and<00:06:46.339> I<00:06:46.459> can<00:06:46.959> just<00:06:47.959> repeat<00:06:48.259> the

00:06:48.429 --> 00:06:48.439 
of the hip and I can just repeat the

00:06:48.439 --> 00:07:02.090 
of the hip and I can just repeat the
process<00:06:48.469> that<00:06:49.159> I've<00:06:49.279> done<00:06:49.429> on<00:06:49.610> this<00:06:49.819> side<00:06:50.059> here

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100 

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.270 

so<00:07:03.000> that's<00:07:03.300> my<00:07:03.510> plan<00:07:03.840> on<00:07:04.110> how<00:07:04.320> to<00:07:04.350> fix<00:07:05.040> this

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 
so that's my plan on how to fix this

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:12.530 
so that's my plan on how to fix this
saggy<00:07:07.160> hip<00:07:10.850> and<00:07:11.850> I'm<00:07:12.000> sure<00:07:12.180> there's<00:07:12.360> other

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:12.540 
saggy hip and I'm sure there's other

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.810 
saggy hip and I'm sure there's other
ways<00:07:13.050> to<00:07:13.110> do<00:07:13.500> this<00:07:13.710> I<00:07:13.950> just<00:07:14.160> don't<00:07:14.400> know<00:07:14.550> of<00:07:14.580> any

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:14.820 
ways to do this I just don't know of any

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.450 
ways to do this I just don't know of any
other<00:07:14.940> ways<00:07:15.240> and<00:07:15.480> I've<00:07:15.540> tried<00:07:15.720> to<00:07:15.870> find<00:07:16.460> some

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:17.460 
other ways and I've tried to find some

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.060 
other ways and I've tried to find some
information<00:07:17.670> on<00:07:18.120> YouTube<00:07:18.990> and<00:07:19.320> all<00:07:19.680> over<00:07:19.920> the

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:20.070 
information on YouTube and all over the

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:23.180 
information on YouTube and all over the
internet<00:07:20.400> so<00:07:20.810> hopefully<00:07:21.810> this<00:07:21.990> will<00:07:22.170> be<00:07:22.920> some

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:23.190 
internet so hopefully this will be some

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.450 
internet so hopefully this will be some
help<00:07:23.430> to<00:07:23.700> someone<00:07:24.060> out<00:07:24.180> there
