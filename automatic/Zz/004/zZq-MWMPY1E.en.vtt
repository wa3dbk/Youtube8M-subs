00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.180
 but 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.210
 today we will meet in malaga sport a little 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.800
 more to the andalusian skating club a 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.720
 young club that develops all its 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.590
 activity on the skating rink of the 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.590
 promenade 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:31.700
 hello I'm Paco Núñez club president 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.700
 of skating to andalus and this is 3pm 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.460
 they also prepare sports games 

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:39.780
 especially the modalities of 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.780
 speed and skill 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:48.010
 here on this track 3 pm we have it from 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.330
 October to May out of season 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.430
 summer here we adapt a bit a 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.410
 speed skating circuit here 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.660
 we are doing the training of the 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.379
 Andalusian club for the season 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.720
 speed skating and also also 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.010
 we use this track as a site of 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.860
 Recreation for all skaters 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.260
 Malaga can be slalom can be done 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.810
 practice braking in our workshops 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.580
 of braking good all the neighbors of 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.580
 Malaga can attend here 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.500
 looking for the column 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.409
 come controlling the stride controlling 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.409
 the step of skater 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.530
 come the last round for all 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.900
 lets control the stride controlling 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.900
 the step of skater 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.980
 we make 3 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.230
 we make the 3 good when one gets to 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.030
 the skating lessons the first thing that 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.730
 explains the importance of 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.890
 protections because although we know 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.780
 skid better or worse there is always the 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.600
 possibility of a fall of 12 equip 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:16.130
 the helmets elbow guards knee pads 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.500
 the little ones especially and learn to 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.010
 accompany the fall would be for example 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.040
 always the head safety position 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.890
 knee shoulder and first wheel this should 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.530
 be a line as soon as we lose what 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.420
 we look for the soil is the first thing that 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.060
 teaches the first one once 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.160
 we control the fall we can move forward 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.240
 well the little ones especially with 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.400
 the basic games 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.870
 with the wide cones the planes of 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.390
 soil that if there is a fall do not make 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.570
 damage those conquests what we call the 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:52.380
 lemon opens and closes that mimics braking 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.060
 in wedge of the ski and also especially 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.080
 many cooperative games are made for 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.960
 that children even if it's a sport 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.110
 Individual know how to take the sport 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.700
 also with colleagues is a sport 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.590
 that you can do very well with all 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.530
 families, parents, children 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.590
 any age and everyone starts 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:15.510
 in the same way with the protections the 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:21.720
 slalom and those are the beginnings that we're going 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:24.030
 to lose left to right the 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.980
 arms 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.840
 I use the arms 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.660
 the arms 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.800
 other guys we make the arms chair 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.800
 front agacho 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.530
 the arm in front of the back 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.769
 appointed 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.950
 these are speed skates not the 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.370
 main difference with the rest of 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:10.069
 skates was a low booty of low cane and 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.840
 I had a longer iron for 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:15.139
 and include in them a wheel of greater 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.750
 diameter is the largest diameter we 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:20.509
 facilitates greater speed 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.800
 stability and also less friction 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:25.530
 on the floor 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.020
 let's say we get a speed of 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.879
 Major cruiser that is called Skates 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.889
 with smaller wheels although the 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:36.440
 torn always costs more to take it 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.440
 because a slower skate on the exits 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.090
 skating does not need to have a form 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.250
 excellent physics anyone can 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.400
 start because a sport of low 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:59.430
 impact normally people do not usually 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.600
 injure or anything knee or ankle 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.900
 nor swim more like other sports 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.910
 then equip yourself with the skates and a 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.920
 rolling smooth because you can carry a 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.200
 very high rate if it forms a very 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.350
 smooth rhythm if you're at it started 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.980
 then you do not need to have any level 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.980
 high athletic 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.900
 the andalusian club of skating returns to 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:28.270
 the load in October with the days of 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.270
 learning every weekend 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:39.980
 using the arms as we already know hand 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:44.350
 front to the side of the nose 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.350
 the other arm with the palm facing up
