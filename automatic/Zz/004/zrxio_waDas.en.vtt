00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 I already have everyone here finally 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.549
 another drouin knife tutorial I already know that 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.370
 many like these videos a lot 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.040
 but I do not know have not put to take out new 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.650
 spots and that's good here I bring you a 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.849
 mission are six shots in domination this 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.289
 I hope you liked it took us 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.940
 like two hours looking for places to 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.470
 that exactly the knives are what 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.480
 which is the flag I do not know exactly or 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.279
 very close to her because there is on youtube 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.199
 but that there are very long fall is 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.430
 exaggeratedly far from the flags do not 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.500
 exaggeratedly but it is very difficult 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.529
 kill someone like that then here they 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.719
 we bring six shots the first one is for 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.090
 put in this little house that is on the side 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.730
 left of the rise that is there by 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.410
 years call us what they already put corner 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.200
 they will align the other the court with what 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.210
 that is up and up already you know up 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.649
 up they point and release them then it goes 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.000
 to stay exactly what is the 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.680
 age banner go here what the click 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.360
 in the stratum is my comrade urbina who 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.700
 I'm giving 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.060
 in the way that there is right in what is 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.130
 that is very very very likely to kill 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.460
 to someone so the truth is a very 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.190
 dog this other is for the flag of ve 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.930
 on the internet and it says that you put on 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.760
 there in the other videos that the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.740
 corner but the truth is put there no no 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.330
 they are not right put on this side 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.430
 blocking can be next this crazy go 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.540
 to align with ve and up and go to 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.920
 killing someone is not going to fall 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.810
 exactly what it is to see if you can 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.729
 there after the court is left exaggerate 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.070
 exaggeratedly away from the flag and the 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.090
 true if someone is killed because 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.190
 is this 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.810
 that is already way 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.510
 grab another goal here go lacke 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.670
 Where does this fall? 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.020
 this is when you hear that 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.850
 if they are in that area and you listen 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.590
 that you are capturing sees you already know more or 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.740
 less how to pull this the court 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.480
 this is to send it for what they are going 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.770
 to put in this step really what 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.310
 it's already as if destroyed in the most 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.290
 boy are you going to point c to banality 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.580
 with c equal everything up they throw it what 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:57.670
 release and see an equal here in what 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.960
 exactly exactly equal 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.700
 internet arrive to get further back 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.820
 but I tell them it does not fall into what you want 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.380
 so here is exactly 15 and in 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.970
 we try to find an easy way 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.979
 that you are located quickly 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.390
 that's why we look for as well as fences or 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.660
 something like that so that you of flying see 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.610
 this are shots like that alternative 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.400
 so that you have several points 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.860
 for to throw is have seized 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.330
 this tambo exactly pegaditos of the 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.510
 right of the tambo will line up with ve 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.390
 they are going to let go and will fall into what is 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.950
 we bring you two shots for each flag 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.540
 then why not for that 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.580
 mate hand so they have clicks on 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.990
 mamones is they were telling me 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.190
 I 'm going to throw you, I do not even acclimate 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.210
 the plan view saying that why 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.100
 I put why 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.350
 I did not put a flag 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.330
 this other my favorite will be to put 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.990
 exactly what the flag is on must 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.790
 they are going to line up with and the knife falls almost 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.390
 almost on the stick of ugt what the flag 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.600

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.269
