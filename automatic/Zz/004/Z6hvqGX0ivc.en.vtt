was my charge you know we could we could

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.710 
was my charge you know we could we could
reinvent<00:00:51.620> anything<00:00:52.040> we<00:00:52.130> needed<00:00:52.340> to<00:00:52.570> to<00:00:53.570> work

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
reinvent anything we needed to to work

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.170 
reinvent anything we needed to to work
towards<00:00:54.110> that<00:00:54.170> and<00:00:54.530> earn<00:00:55.280> that<00:00:55.309> and<00:00:55.820> so<00:00:56.000> that

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
towards that and earn that and so that

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.870 
towards that and earn that and so that
was<00:00:56.300> really<00:00:56.329> our<00:00:56.690> our<00:00:57.440> goal<00:00:58.160> and<00:00:58.430> it<00:00:58.550> kind<00:00:58.820> of

was really our our goal and it kind of

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.360 
was really our our goal and it kind of

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
journey but it sort of took on a life of

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.210 
journey but it sort of took on a life of
its<00:01:05.449> own<00:01:05.750> even<00:01:06.110> for<00:01:06.320> us<00:01:06.440> and<00:01:06.799> we<00:01:06.860> got<00:01:06.979> so

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
there's so much heart into it when what

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:25.980 
there's so much heart into it when what
was<00:02:24.850> your<00:02:25.000> favorite<00:02:25.330> part<00:02:25.540> of<00:02:25.630> this<00:02:25.750> process

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
was your favorite part of this process

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.020 
was your favorite part of this process
of<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:26.470> film<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:29.620> favorite<00:02:30.040> part<00:02:30.250> now<00:02:30.550> was

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
of the film the favorite part now was

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.640 
of the film the favorite part now was
the<00:02:31.210> creation<00:02:31.600> of<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.780> story<00:02:32.050> it<00:02:32.350> was<00:02:32.470> also

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
the creation of the story it was also

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.190 
the creation of the story it was also
the<00:02:32.950> most<00:02:33.100> challenging<00:02:33.610> part<00:02:33.900> because<00:02:34.900> it's

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
the most challenging part because it's

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.140 
the most challenging part because it's
very<00:02:35.500> hard<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:35.890> get<00:02:36.100> all<00:02:36.220> those<00:02:36.400> pieces<00:02:36.670> to<00:02:36.970> fit

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
very hard to get all those pieces to fit

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.940 
very hard to get all those pieces to fit
together<00:02:37.240> perfectly<00:02:37.600> but<00:02:38.110> when<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.350> do<00:02:38.560> it's

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
together perfectly but when you do it's

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.920 
together perfectly but when you do it's
extremely<00:02:39.550> rewarding<00:02:39.730> I<00:02:40.300> think<00:02:40.660> what<00:02:40.780> goes

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
extremely rewarding I think what goes

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.750 
extremely rewarding I think what goes
hand-in-hand<00:02:41.230> with<00:02:41.410> that<00:02:41.590> is<00:02:41.860> because<00:02:42.130> it's

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
hand-in-hand with that is because it's

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.420 
hand-in-hand with that is because it's
it's<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.300> collaboration<00:02:43.740> the<00:02:44.740> story<00:02:45.010> process

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
it's the collaboration the story process

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.400 
it's the collaboration the story process
and<00:02:45.610> every<00:02:45.790> part<00:02:46.030> of<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.510> production<00:02:47.290> is

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
and every part of the the production is

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.530 
and every part of the the production is
a<00:02:47.440> collaboration<00:02:47.950> wait<00:02:48.370> we<00:02:48.640> you<00:02:49.240> know<00:02:49.330> over

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
a Disney film kind of on its ear but in

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.550 
a Disney film kind of on its ear but in
a<00:03:21.730> way<00:03:21.850> that<00:03:22.060> you<00:03:22.180> also<00:03:22.330> say<00:03:22.720> but<00:03:23.170> this<00:03:23.320> feels

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
a way that you also say but this feels

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.340 
a way that you also say but this feels
classic<00:03:24.040> so<00:03:24.610> I<00:03:24.970> hope<00:03:25.150> they<00:03:25.330> like<00:03:25.510> that<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:26.080> the
