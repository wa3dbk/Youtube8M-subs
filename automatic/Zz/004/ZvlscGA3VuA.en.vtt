00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:08.639
 hello we are on the center of huy 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.900
 that at this 2014 edition of the ifa I you 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.389
 shows the wac what you know 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.680
 no doubt who is the first smartphone 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.400
 of huy qu with nvidia tegra 4 processor 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.480
 ears so a 4g smartphone is 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.840
 today yes co presents his 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.640
 successor which is the highway iv I 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.460
 so a brand new model with a 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.759
 bigger screen of 5 inches a screen 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.520
 full hd and of course the hero and 4g 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.430
 ship the chip of nvidia the chip tegra 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.110
 4 puts in a little bit 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.969
 more importance since it goes up to 2 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.430
 giguÃ¨re this time on this phone 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.149
 we have some notable differences on 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.050
 this device 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:52.559
 we have a sensor that goes to 16 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:57.239
 megapixels in the back and especially to 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.370
 the front we have a front camera that 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.460
 reaches 8 megapixels so the ideal for 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.379
 to make beautiful selphy then on the y 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.900
 is I have a small precision the device 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.659
 obviously will only be delivered under a 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.729
 version of android kit kat so while 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.890
 the wax had been delivered under jelly bean 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.439
 is another thing too pretty 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.320
 important is that this device 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.210
 has 16 gigabytes of internal memory 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.909
 which a priori does not seem 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.049
 expandable to there is no I do not have 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.939
 spotted from micro sd port on the other hand the 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.689
 processor is helped by two gigas of 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.840
 RAM 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.759
 while from memory on the wax we had 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.670
 a single giguÃ¨re and finally to conclude 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.500
 on this new to there is I have one thing 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.780
 important that I can hardly 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.909
 to show you is that it is actually 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.409
 very light so it's nice enough in 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.329
 1 and 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.880
 it has a design that is rather 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.219
 nice with a slice that is 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:58.460
 it seems brushed aluminum so 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:58.460
 it's quite nice and early end
