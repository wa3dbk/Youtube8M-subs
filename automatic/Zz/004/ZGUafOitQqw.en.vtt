slip knot begin with the tail of your
yarn<00:00:21.000> wrap<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:21.960> around<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.259> working<00:00:22.529> yarn<00:00:22.560> as

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
yarn wrap it around the working yarn as

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.429 
yarn wrap it around the working yarn as
if<00:00:23.130> you're<00:00:23.220> gonna<00:00:23.340> make<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.580> simple<00:00:23.910> knot

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
if you're gonna make a simple knot

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.720 
if you're gonna make a simple knot
except<00:00:25.439> don't<00:00:25.680> bring<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.980> tail<00:00:26.160> through<00:00:26.520> and

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
except don't bring the tail through and

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.639 
except don't bring the tail through and
instead<00:00:27.210> grab<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:27.900> loop<00:00:28.110> with<00:00:28.320> your<00:00:28.439> hook

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:28.649 
instead grab that loop with your hook

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:32.990 
instead grab that loop with your hook
tug<00:00:29.369> on<00:00:29.489> it<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.759> tighten<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:31.550> now<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.610> have

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
tug on it to tighten and now you have

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.330 
tug on it to tighten and now you have
the<00:00:33.329> first<00:00:33.480> loop<00:00:33.780> on<00:00:33.960> your<00:00:33.989> hook<00:00:34.160> to<00:00:35.160> make<00:00:35.309> a

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
the first loop on your hook to make a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.940 
the first loop on your hook to make a
chain<00:00:35.840> with<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.960> yarn<00:00:37.200> behind<00:00:37.440> your<00:00:37.770> hook

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
chain with the yarn behind your hook

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.210 
chain with the yarn behind your hook
wrap<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.730> over<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.059> top<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.239> your<00:00:39.510> hook<00:00:39.660> and

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
wrap it over the top of your hook and

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.060 
wrap it over the top of your hook and
pull<00:00:41.220> it<00:00:41.460> through<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.940> loop<00:00:42.090> wrap<00:00:42.860> it<00:00:43.860> around

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
pull it through the loop wrap it around

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.180 
pull it through the loop wrap it around
pull<00:00:44.580> it<00:00:45.510> through<00:00:45.870> when<00:00:46.740> you<00:00:46.830> wrap<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.160> yarn

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
pull it through when you wrap the yarn

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.650 
pull it through when you wrap the yarn
around<00:00:47.370> your<00:00:47.610> hook<00:00:47.700> it's<00:00:48.090> called<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.450> yarn

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
around your hook it's called it yarn

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.380 
around your hook it's called it yarn
over<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.710> when<00:00:49.830> I<00:00:49.890> say<00:00:50.070> yarn<00:00:50.310> over<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.850> means<00:00:51.210> go

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
over so when I say yarn over it means go

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.860 
over so when I say yarn over it means go
like<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.190> pull<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.310> through<00:00:53.490> the<00:00:53.610> loop

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
like this and pull it through the loop

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.570 
like this and pull it through the loop
this<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.080> your<00:00:55.230> chain<00:00:55.470> and<00:00:56.070> when<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.280> begin<00:00:56.430> a

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
this is your chain and when you begin a

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.069 
this is your chain and when you begin a
project<00:00:56.820> with<00:00:57.150> a<00:00:57.180> chain<00:00:57.390> like<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:57.600> it's

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
project with a chain like this it's

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.680 
project with a chain like this it's
called<00:00:58.350> your<00:00:58.620> foundation<00:00:59.070> chain<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.690> that's

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
called your foundation chain and that's

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.100 
called your foundation chain and that's
the<00:01:00.840> very<00:01:01.020> basic<00:01:01.380> beginning<00:01:01.860> of<00:01:02.010> crochet<00:01:03.110> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
crochet to make one into a chain you

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.590 
crochet to make one into a chain you
skip<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.610> first<00:01:08.759> chain<00:01:08.880> which<00:01:09.299> counts<00:01:09.570> as

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
skip the first chain which counts as

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.929 
skip the first chain which counts as
your<00:01:09.659> turning<00:01:10.049> chain<00:01:10.280> insert<00:01:11.280> your<00:01:11.430> hook<00:01:11.640> into

your turning chain insert your hook into

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.700 
your turning chain insert your hook into
the<00:01:12.329> next<00:01:12.600> chain<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.049> I'm<00:01:13.259> inserting<00:01:13.590> my<00:01:13.680> hook

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
the next chain and I'm inserting my hook

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.840 
the next chain and I'm inserting my hook
into<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.130> bottom<00:01:14.460> loop<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.970> my<00:01:15.689> chain<00:01:19.850> yarn

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
into the bottom loop of my chain yarn

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.370 
into the bottom loop of my chain yarn
over<00:01:21.090> which<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.720> bring<00:01:21.870> your<00:01:21.990> yarn<00:01:22.140> over

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
over which is to bring your yarn over

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.410 
over which is to bring your yarn over
the<00:01:22.470> hook<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.800> pull<00:01:22.970> it<00:01:23.970> through<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.270> chain

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
the hook and pull it through the chain

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.810 
the hook and pull it through the chain
so<00:01:24.900> there<00:01:25.050> are<00:01:25.110> two<00:01:25.260> loops<00:01:25.470> on<00:01:25.620> your<00:01:25.650> hook<00:01:25.820> yarn

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
so there are two loops on your hook yarn

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.270 
so there are two loops on your hook yarn
over<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.330> pull<00:01:27.450> through<00:01:28.200> both<00:01:28.260> loops<00:01:28.530> that's
