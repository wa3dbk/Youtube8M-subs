00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:06.550

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:09.210
 give me this time for that is a 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.210
 pleasure and an honor 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.330
 I wish I could start by asking you 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.779
 more than 10 years of your retirement passed and 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.970
 it was in 2004 2004 we are to be 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.670
 good we are going to do 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.890
 as we explained to a boy of 10 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.660
 years that's why this video play who 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.759
 it was pichi bell in fact I can 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.949
 explain why 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.390
 you were one of those one of the great 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:38.550
 referents not only mine but of all 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.140
 our generation and how would you explain 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.140
 as a player who was pichi bell 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.650
 ask me, did you start incisor well? 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.530
 I'm really going to tell you something that to me 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.150
 happens today is sometimes we go 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.970
 to the court with many places that one 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.890
 tour of the country comes to ask 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.140
 autographs guy that come back they have 8 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.680
 9 10 11 years that obviously I do not 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.820
 they saw play 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:07.320
 obviously they do not know who is one 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.540
 surely the parents will have told him 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.960
 now they have heard the name or they will have 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.170
 seen some video I guess if I had 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.850
 to tell him that he was a player that I had 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.110
 a person that I was lucky to be able to 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.240
 do 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.450
 in life what I love was the buster 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.910
 I want to be able to live from what I like and 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.840
 He was fortunate to be able to achieve many 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.950
 things 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.259
 but I always have the doubt in what way 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.689
 the parents to many of those guys 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.390
 they say who I was because to me 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:44.450
 surprise and I think this is going to 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.360
 many spend tomorrow 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.369
 the golden generation nor to talk but 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.229
 an experience that I live that I've 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.770
 lived in this time that not the 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.770
 encounter explains 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.520
 yes 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.970
 of the tournament of three months eight months 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.310
 the meeting 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.880
 to deliver the prize for the valuable of 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.480
 this election and plan begins in the 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.480
 game of stars 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.790
 The player most value 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.879
 for people from 50 up 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:10.460
 obviously and the great references of 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:11.990
 basketball are you you marcelo juan 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.260
 and the impact they have had on the 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:18.390
 golden generation has been tremendous you 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:22.380
 is aware of 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.870
 that you were for example a mirror for 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.340
 emanuel ginÃ³bili the best players 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.340
 of the history of Latin America 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.210
 if not 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.310
 yes because I think that as for the 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.240
 own experience another player is 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.670
 important 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.670
 who played before our generation 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.160
 of my generation I did not see it as a mirror 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.600
 and one has taken things out and one has had 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.600
 sharing teaching 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.170
 obviously I can not say that I do not think 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.299
 that surely some influence 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.700
 we had to say it for you 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.200
 we are filled with pride because more 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.760
 beyond what one individually does 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.150
 one also wants to leave something for the 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.950
 sport wants to leave some teachings 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.950
 many few but all leave a mark 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.180
 and I think if the important players 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.680
 they always leave with their behavior 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.989
 with your actions 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.389
 small cairns that later the 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.840
 players from other generations 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.840
 can take
