00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 to organize a Halloween party going 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.990
 beyond putting music and costume art 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.420
 in this video I'm going to show you four 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.420
 deliciously frightening recipes 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.330
 to make mini pizzas of mummy dale 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:18.779
 form a loaf of bread with a cutter 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.779
 round 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.700
 and then a bloody sauce either 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.030
 red and cover it with mozzarella cheese 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.030
 cut into strips 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:41.670
 try to leave a space for the 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:44.860
 others that will be two pieces of olive 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.630
 for nothing 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.300
 two 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.940
 When you have several mummies, take them to the 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:56.400
 Low temperature oven for no more than 5 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.400
 minutes or the cheese will lose its shape 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.500
 to make chocolate tombs you're going to 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.780
 need a personal container 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.970
 rectangular pour chocolate pudding 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.140
 to the top and cover it with pieces 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.140
 big cookie today 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.000
 then crush other cookies until 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.100
 are made powder to simulate 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.100
 earth and ends to cover the grave 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.829
 take a vanilla cookie and with 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.310
 chocolate frosting writes the word 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:42.560
 rich or the name of your guests then 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.560
 with a knife to shape the tombstone 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.470
 place a little green frosting and 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.470
 mix it with the earth 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.690
 finally add the arm of a beard 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.690
 of a flower as a final touch 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.140
 to make brain cupcakes 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.550
 place white marshmallows in the 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.550
 microwave for 2 minutes 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.160
 when you take them out to be very 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.680
 soft beats with a spoon until 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.230
 you get a sticky mass then 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.530
 add one or two drops of red dye 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.569
 and pretty sugar powder remember that 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.430
 this step is very exaggerated since the 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.819
 consistency in the mass will depend on the 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.819
 sugar 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:01.050
 to mass and add more powdered sugar 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.050
 until a malleable and soft mass is obtained 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.050
 a cupcake with a little frosting and with 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.470
 the mass of long triphy marshmallows 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.470
 and thin 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.750
 Now it's just up to you to shape it 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.240
 What do you want your brain ? 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.100
 I recommend working half by half and 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.720
 end passes a knife through the middle to 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.720
 mark the halves even more 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.840
 if you want your brain to be 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.940
 bloody and sluggish adds a bit of 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.790
 strawberry jam on the surface of the 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.790
 cupcake they will make horrendously tasty 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.069
 finally create your own position of 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.230
 witch pours some clear drink in a 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.770
 container and had the green one with 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.770
 Colorant 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.210
 place the beverage container inside 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.970
 of a larger one and add dry ice with 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:18.150
 skewers be very careful because if you 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.520
 you touch you can burn your fingers arrived 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.910
 the time to do magic pours water on 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.160
 the ice 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.890
 I as dense and white will start to come out 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.510
 of the container this will give a touch 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.510
 magical and spooky to your table 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:36.060
 I hope you liked these ideas 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.060
 and take them to make this halo 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:50.169

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:52.449
