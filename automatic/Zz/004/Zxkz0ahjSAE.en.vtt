00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.140
 the kindest during the trial with you 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:09.090
 belanovsky alexander and tatyana smash 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:12.150
 and our new personal sales training and so 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.049
 Today we are with you next small 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:20.000
 a lesson and I would like to learn from Tatyana to 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.769
 she told you most 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.960
 business executives in which there are 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.180
 sales yes they still depend on 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.179
 According to customers, there are more 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.870
 Clients of themes under normal organization 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.090
 sales the more revenue so here's all 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.160
 after some time it happens 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.910
 such that customers always grow 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.070
 grow and grow grow in all some 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:50.000
 time point the question arises where 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:53.540
 gone customers understand 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.090
 usual situation in business is driver 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.730
 looking down from his height 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.150
 provisions like incoming calls and here 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.860
 seemingly managers with you leave but 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.560
 with all this he looks afterwards 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.760
 we are waiting for the security for a month and thinks 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.280
 palettes we all did already take 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.220
 Well Th calls you, we talked with them 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.160
 prepared some commercial investments 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.200
 we are in response to the fact that our managers 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.840
 which calls 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.450
 but in the end it turns out that the output before 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.619
 sales and well there the cat cried so here 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.180
 the main reason for the output 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.320
 few sales 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.390
 the main number of visits 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.460
 falls off not the funnels first we all 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.710
 present sales turnover is 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.570
 build and our sales there which 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.880
 which our client moves up to 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:50.010
 breakdowns 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:52.590
 the output is that the output 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.840
 sales are few and the main reason is nice 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.750
 pierced just in the middle when 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.110
 I do not set up my sick way 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.820
 control over the passage of the client you 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.570
 see incoming call 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.929
 the first thing to do is 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.410
 in the log of incoming customers in order 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:15.020
 so that the call and the same you at least you 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.530
 get and erase why he didn't get to 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.550
 applications why he did not come for the day 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.190
 information we must necessarily 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.380
 collector besides this you owe her 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.690
 manage ie they must 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.730
 and every bid in some way 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.830
 set up those passing process yes I 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.540
 most do if you sign 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.070
 so let's say the moment of passing the application 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.570
 very simple 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.540
 literally painted on one page 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.640
 4 formats on all with this 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.130
 to punish if they don't 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.290
 what 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.120
 this is the main reason 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.640
 what are some of the customers 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.230
 you just plain falls off 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.660
 your funnel and almost 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.480
 rode will not be different to control he 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.909
 and already 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.810
 most offensively, for example, if we 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.909
 read out 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.760
 that his impulses were appropriated the day 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:08.930
 earned if masks you suddenly from 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.360
 no head release 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.650
 she would at times even burn 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.629
 more than that 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.450
 Now, therefore, go about the rules 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:22.270
 technological percentage 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.120
 driving and I am yours 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.100
 your sales and tightly control it 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.060
 Thank you Tatiana was with you 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.330
 korobeynikov 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.000
 and it reminded me a little joke 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.710
 when a man comes to the park and looks 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.050
 and and the house two 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.880
 one pit digs and the second pit 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.950
 buried one side another 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.500
 bury you guys don't burn 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.350
 do it open and trees plant it 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.730
 where the trees with us should have been 3 he 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:54.790
 they had to bake rock sick here and 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.280
 that's actually as I understand it 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.100
 those regulations and that is control over 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.590
 so that this third came well yes and walked 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.740
 because most executives are they 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.870
 just everyone was given the task themselves 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:12.070
 go somewhere to do your own thing 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:15.340
 3 sick did not come and I plow later 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:18.370
 tired dug up buried 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.980
 and finally agreement and 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.170
 the result is zero and so it was 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.690
 Belanovsky Alexander and Tatyana 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:29.790
 korobeynikova with our new training and 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.790
 perpetual sales engine
