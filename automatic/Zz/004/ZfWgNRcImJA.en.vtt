but<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:01.920> think<00:02:02.099> it<00:02:02.190> is<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.789> a<00:02:02.880> really<00:02:03.119> good

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
but I think it is a it is a really good

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.229 
but I think it is a it is a really good
knife<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:03.959> we're<00:02:04.050> gonna<00:02:04.140> do<00:02:04.319> now<00:02:04.560> here<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.099> a

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:05.239 
knife so we're gonna do now here is a

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:08.749 
knife so we're gonna do now here is a
we'll<00:02:06.239> get<00:02:06.360> out<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.630> tape<00:02:06.810> measure<00:02:07.429> and<00:02:08.429> we'll

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
we'll get out the tape measure and we'll

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.430 
we'll get out the tape measure and we'll
take<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:08.970> look<00:02:09.179> at<00:02:09.330> some<00:02:09.569> overall<00:02:09.959> lengths<00:02:10.289> on

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
take a look at some overall lengths on

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.760 
take a look at some overall lengths on
this<00:02:10.640> so<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.940> looks<00:02:12.150> like<00:02:12.420> overall<00:02:13.080> it's<00:02:13.709> about

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
this so it looks like overall it's about

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.900 
this so it looks like overall it's about
six<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.790> quarter<00:02:15.090> inches<00:02:15.470> with<00:02:16.470> about<00:02:17.459> two

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
six and a quarter inches with about two

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.190 
six and a quarter inches with about two
and<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.090> half<00:02:18.270> inches<00:02:18.569> worth<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.900> cutting

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
and a half inches worth of cutting

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.559 
and a half inches worth of cutting
surface<00:02:19.620> if<00:02:20.160> we<00:02:20.370> measure<00:02:20.580> from<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:21.030> tip<00:02:21.270> to

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
surface if we measure from the tip to

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.559 
surface if we measure from the tip to
the<00:02:21.810> chamfer<00:02:22.290> here<00:02:22.970> it<00:02:23.970> is<00:02:24.120> very<00:02:24.390> ergonomic

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
the chamfer here it is very ergonomic

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.600 
the chamfer here it is very ergonomic
you<00:02:25.260> can<00:02:25.379> get<00:02:25.470> your<00:02:25.620> hand<00:02:25.800> in<00:02:25.920> there<00:02:25.980> for<00:02:26.430> fine

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
you can get your hand in there for fine

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.040 
you can get your hand in there for fine
detail<00:02:26.819> work<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.390> have<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.540> jimping<00:02:27.870> on<00:02:27.959> the

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
detail work you have the jimping on the

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.350 
detail work you have the jimping on the
spine<00:02:28.610> again<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.640> think<00:02:29.790> this<00:02:30.030> is<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.209> little

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
spine again I think this is a little

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.180 
spine again I think this is a little
large<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.750> be<00:02:31.020> classified<00:02:31.590> as<00:02:31.770> a<00:02:31.830> neck<00:02:32.010> knife

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
large to be classified as a neck knife

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.220 
large to be classified as a neck knife
but<00:02:32.730> I<00:02:32.760> think<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.150> would<00:02:33.330> be<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.540> really<00:02:34.080> nice

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
but I think it would be a really nice

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.070 
but I think it would be a really nice
EDC<00:02:34.890> knife<00:02:34.920> it's<00:02:35.280> pretty<00:02:35.519> light<00:02:35.930> fits<00:02:36.930> right

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
EDC knife it's pretty light fits right

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.050 
EDC knife it's pretty light fits right
into<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.349> pouch<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.980> think<00:02:38.220> what<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.400> would<00:02:38.519> do<00:02:38.790> is

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
into a pouch I think what I would do is

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.229 
into a pouch I think what I would do is
take<00:02:39.330> out<00:02:39.540> all<00:02:39.780> this<00:02:40.400> pseudo<00:02:41.400> paracord<00:02:41.970> here

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
take out all this pseudo paracord here

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.809 
take out all this pseudo paracord here
and<00:02:42.420> maybe<00:02:42.780> zip<00:02:43.200> tie<00:02:43.379> this<00:02:43.440> or<00:02:43.860> connect<00:02:44.580> this

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
and maybe zip tie this or connect this

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.880 
and maybe zip tie this or connect this
right<00:02:45.090> on<00:02:45.239> to<00:02:45.510> my<00:02:45.660> Molly<00:02:45.930> gear<00:02:46.290> in<00:02:46.470> one<00:02:46.709> of<00:02:46.769> my

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
right on to my Molly gear in one of my

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.610 
right on to my Molly gear in one of my
tactical<00:02:47.849> bags<00:02:48.030> or<00:02:48.239> my<00:02:48.300> EDC<00:02:48.599> bags<00:02:49.019> and<00:02:49.290> this

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
tactical bags or my EDC bags and this

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.979 
tactical bags or my EDC bags and this
would<00:02:49.769> make<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:49.920> great<00:02:50.129> little<00:02:50.250> EDC<00:02:50.910> knife<00:02:50.989> so

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
would make a great little EDC knife so

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:52.820 
would make a great little EDC knife so
let's<00:02:52.200> take<00:02:52.410> a<00:02:52.440> look

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
let's take a look

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.890 
let's take a look
Volkers<00:02:53.220> they<00:02:53.610> either<00:02:53.730> come<00:02:54.060> razor-sharp<00:02:54.450> or

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
Volkers they either come razor-sharp or

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.330 
Volkers they either come razor-sharp or
they<00:02:55.019> come<00:02:55.260> dull<00:02:55.530> as<00:02:55.680> heck<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:55.860> it<00:02:56.099> can<00:02:56.220> be

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
they come dull as heck and it can be

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.339 
they come dull as heck and it can be
tough<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.180> go<00:02:57.420> either<00:02:57.599> way<00:02:57.840> so<00:02:57.900> let's<00:02:58.170> take<00:02:58.319> a

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
tough to go either way so let's take a

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.610 
tough to go either way so let's take a
look<00:02:58.560> here<00:02:59.239> so<00:03:00.239> yeah<00:03:00.540> I<00:03:00.780> mean<00:03:00.900> it's<00:03:01.409> not<00:03:01.560> bad

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
look here so yeah I mean it's not bad

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.220 
look here so yeah I mean it's not bad
you<00:03:02.219> know<00:03:02.340> for<00:03:02.549> 440<00:03:03.030> stainless<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.810> this<00:03:04.109> is

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
you know for 440 stainless and this is

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.790 
you know for 440 stainless and this is
going<00:03:04.439> real<00:03:04.650> slow<00:03:04.859> I<00:03:05.189> know<00:03:05.249> you<00:03:05.370> see

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
going real slow I know you see

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.440 
going real slow I know you see
people<00:03:06.040> getting<00:03:06.250> reviews<00:03:06.610> were<00:03:06.790> there<00:03:06.940> you

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
people getting reviews were there you

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.210 
people getting reviews were there you
know<00:03:07.480> they<00:03:07.870> really<00:03:08.020> just<00:03:08.380> chopping<00:03:08.740> at<00:03:08.860> it<00:03:09.040> and

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
know they really just chopping at it and

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.760 
know they really just chopping at it and
I<00:03:09.910> find<00:03:10.210> the<00:03:10.510> best<00:03:10.630> way<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:10.870> test<00:03:11.170> a<00:03:11.410> sharpness

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
I find the best way to test a sharpness

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.240 
I find the best way to test a sharpness
of<00:03:11.950> a<00:03:12.040> knife<00:03:12.070> is<00:03:12.580> to<00:03:12.850> go<00:03:12.970> slow<00:03:13.440> I<00:03:14.440> think<00:03:15.070> anybody

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
of a knife is to go slow I think anybody

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.310 
of a knife is to go slow I think anybody
can<00:03:15.550> you<00:03:16.000> know<00:03:16.120> shave<00:03:16.600> it<00:03:16.750> off<00:03:16.870> like<00:03:17.110> that<00:03:17.260> and

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
can you know shave it off like that and

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.050 
can you know shave it off like that and
it<00:03:17.500> makes<00:03:17.620> it<00:03:17.800> look<00:03:17.950> really<00:03:18.160> impressive<00:03:18.700> and

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
it makes it look really impressive and

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.830 
it makes it look really impressive and
it<00:03:19.510> is<00:03:19.600> a<00:03:19.840> sharp<00:03:20.110> knife<00:03:20.320> you<00:03:20.980> know<00:03:21.360> but<00:03:22.360> again<00:03:22.450> I

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
it is a sharp knife you know but again I

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.030 
it is a sharp knife you know but again I
think<00:03:22.990> it's<00:03:23.260> a<00:03:23.320> little<00:03:23.410> large<00:03:23.710> to<00:03:23.800> be

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
think it's a little large to be

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.890 
think it's a little large to be
classified<00:03:24.520> as<00:03:24.640> a<00:03:24.700> neck<00:03:24.880> knife<00:03:25.060> but<00:03:25.660> I<00:03:25.690> think

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
classified as a neck knife but I think

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.360 
classified as a neck knife but I think
it<00:03:25.960> would<00:03:26.050> make<00:03:26.200> a<00:03:26.260> really<00:03:26.710> good<00:03:26.830> EDC<00:03:27.340> knife

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
it would make a really good EDC knife

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.210 
it would make a really good EDC knife
you<00:03:27.850> know<00:03:27.970> it<00:03:28.030> is<00:03:28.300> extremely<00:03:28.570> light<00:03:29.140> with<00:03:30.070> the

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
you know it is extremely light with the

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.860 
you know it is extremely light with the
skeletonized<00:03:30.760> and<00:03:30.940> I<00:03:31.000> like<00:03:31.210> the<00:03:31.330> blade<00:03:31.540> design

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
skeletonized and I like the blade design

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.630 
skeletonized and I like the blade design
you<00:03:32.080> know<00:03:32.170> they<00:03:32.290> could<00:03:32.440> be<00:03:32.560> great<00:03:32.650> for<00:03:33.010> for

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
you know they could be great for for

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.400 
you know they could be great for for
all-around<00:03:33.910> use<00:03:34.240> and<00:03:34.510> it's<00:03:34.600> not<00:03:34.750> so<00:03:35.080> large

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
all-around use and it's not so large

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.630 
all-around use and it's not so large
that<00:03:35.530> you're<00:03:35.770> gonna<00:03:35.860> draw<00:03:36.130> attention<00:03:36.250> to

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
that you're gonna draw attention to

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.480 
that you're gonna draw attention to
yourself<00:03:37.140> you<00:03:38.140> know<00:03:38.230> using<00:03:38.590> it<00:03:38.710> and<00:03:39.160> it's<00:03:39.430> the

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 
yourself you know using it and it's the

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.220 
yourself you know using it and it's the
size<00:03:39.730> of<00:03:39.850> a<00:03:39.970> folder<00:03:40.330> but<00:03:40.630> I<00:03:40.690> think<00:03:40.990> it<00:03:41.110> gives

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
size of a folder but I think it gives

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.950 
size of a folder but I think it gives
the<00:03:41.440> rigidity<00:03:41.710> and<00:03:42.100> the<00:03:42.640> and<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.360> use<00:03:43.600> of<00:03:43.630> a

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:43.960 
the rigidity and the and the use of a

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.170 
the rigidity and the and the use of a
nice<00:03:44.320> fixed<00:03:44.590> blade<00:03:44.890> and<00:03:45.400> you<00:03:45.850> know<00:03:45.910> you<00:03:46.030> can

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
nice fixed blade and you know you can

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.610 
nice fixed blade and you know you can
even<00:03:46.450> if<00:03:46.660> you<00:03:46.720> had<00:03:46.870> you<00:03:47.080> know<00:03:47.140> doing<00:03:47.350> small

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
even if you had you know doing small

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.840 
even if you had you know doing small
tasks<00:03:48.010> you<00:03:48.100> can<00:03:48.130> get<00:03:48.280> your<00:03:48.400> fingers<00:03:48.700> in<00:03:48.730> there

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
tasks you can get your fingers in there

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.490 
tasks you can get your fingers in there
so<00:03:49.060> they're<00:03:49.210> out<00:03:49.330> of<00:03:49.390> the<00:03:49.450> way<00:03:49.600> so<00:03:50.230> all<00:03:50.380> around

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
so they're out of the way so all around

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.170 
so they're out of the way so all around
I<00:03:50.800> think<00:03:50.890> it's<00:03:51.100> a<00:03:51.160> decent<00:03:51.340> blade<00:03:51.670> again<00:03:52.030> it's

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
I think it's a decent blade again it's

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.450 
I think it's a decent blade again it's
in<00:03:52.270> that<00:03:52.360> 440<00:03:52.990> stainless<00:03:53.070> some<00:03:54.070> people<00:03:54.310> have

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:54.460 
in that 440 stainless some people have

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.090 
in that 440 stainless some people have
problems<00:03:54.670> with<00:03:54.910> it<00:03:55.150> I<00:03:55.330> don't<00:03:55.960> know<00:03:56.020> I<00:03:56.050> I<00:03:56.530> find

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
problems with it I don't know I I find

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.860 
problems with it I don't know I I find
so<00:03:57.370> when<00:03:57.490> the<00:03:57.580> edge<00:03:57.700> wears<00:03:57.970> off<00:03:58.210> I<00:03:58.420> sharpen<00:03:58.780> it

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
so when the edge wears off I sharpen it

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.510 
so when the edge wears off I sharpen it
it<00:03:59.230> just<00:03:59.440> it<00:03:59.650> takes<00:03:59.890> it<00:04:00.040> is<00:04:00.160> what<00:04:00.310> it<00:04:00.400> is<00:04:00.490> you

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
it just it takes it is what it is you

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.280 
it just it takes it is what it is you
know<00:04:00.730> you<00:04:00.820> put<00:04:00.970> this<00:04:01.090> in<00:04:01.240> a<00:04:01.300> workmate<00:04:01.750> or<00:04:01.960> work

know you put this in a workmate or work

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.530 
know you put this in a workmate or work
sharp<00:04:02.590> and<00:04:02.830> they<00:04:03.760> come<00:04:03.940> up<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.120> edge<00:04:04.240> comes

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
sharp and they come up the edge comes

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.300 
sharp and they come up the edge comes
back<00:04:04.840> pretty<00:04:05.140> quick<00:04:05.380> sometimes<00:04:06.160> have<00:04:06.280> you

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
back pretty quick sometimes have you

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.950

sharpen<00:04:06.550> them<00:04:06.760> by<00:04:06.880> hand<00:04:07.150> it<00:04:07.630> can<00:04:07.810> be<00:04:07.930> a

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:07.960 
sharpen them by hand it can be a

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.270 
sharpen them by hand it can be a
challenge<00:04:08.380> and<00:04:08.590> you<00:04:08.620> have<00:04:08.800> to<00:04:08.920> really<00:04:09.100> get

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
challenge and you have to really get

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.570 
challenge and you have to really get
used<00:04:09.550> to<00:04:09.700> sharpening<00:04:10.150> that<00:04:10.209> 440<00:04:10.870> stainless

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
used to sharpening that 440 stainless

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.850 
used to sharpening that 440 stainless
but<00:04:12.580> all<00:04:12.730> around<00:04:13.000> I<00:04:13.270> give<00:04:13.750> it<00:04:13.840> as<00:04:14.290> a<00:04:14.380> pretty

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
but all around I give it as a pretty

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.140 
but all around I give it as a pretty
good<00:04:15.040> knife<00:04:15.190> I<00:04:15.400> think<00:04:15.550> this<00:04:15.640> would<00:04:15.790> be<00:04:15.820> a<00:04:15.880> good

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
good knife I think this would be a good

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.870 
good knife I think this would be a good
backup<00:04:16.600> camping<00:04:17.560> knife<00:04:17.709> a<00:04:17.980> good<00:04:18.489> companion

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
backup camping knife a good companion

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.449 
backup camping knife a good companion
again<00:04:19.299> I<00:04:19.510> like<00:04:20.080> the<00:04:20.320> Kydex<00:04:20.560> sheath<00:04:20.830> although

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
again I like the Kydex sheath although

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.250 
again I like the Kydex sheath although
it<00:04:21.580> does<00:04:21.730> move<00:04:21.970> around<00:04:22.240> a<00:04:22.540> little<00:04:22.900> bit<00:04:23.050> in

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
it does move around a little bit in

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.460 
it does move around a little bit in
there<00:04:24.120> but<00:04:25.120> I<00:04:25.150> I<00:04:25.419> definitely<00:04:26.020> like<00:04:26.200> it<00:04:26.230> it

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
there but I I definitely like it it

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.200 
there but I I definitely like it it
holds<00:04:26.620> it<00:04:26.830> well<00:04:27.010> it's<00:04:27.250> functional<00:04:27.730> and<00:04:27.820> it

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
holds it well it's functional and it

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.690 
holds it well it's functional and it
keeps<00:04:28.419> it<00:04:28.570> sturdy<00:04:28.840> as<00:04:29.110> a<00:04:29.169> neck<00:04:29.980> knife<00:04:30.160> again<00:04:30.520> I

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
keeps it sturdy as a neck knife again I

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:31.890 
keeps it sturdy as a neck knife again I
think<00:04:30.820> it's<00:04:31.030> a<00:04:31.090> little<00:04:31.180> too<00:04:31.390> big<00:04:31.540> for<00:04:31.660> a<00:04:31.720> next

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
think it's a little too big for a next

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.990 
think it's a little too big for a next
knife<00:04:32.020> but<00:04:32.290> if<00:04:32.380> you<00:04:32.530> pop<00:04:32.830> these<00:04:33.040> out<00:04:33.250> and<00:04:33.460> put

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
knife but if you pop these out and put

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.159 
knife but if you pop these out and put
some<00:04:34.180> ties<00:04:34.390> in<00:04:34.780> there

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
some ties in there

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:36.720 
some ties in there
I<00:04:35.200> think<00:04:35.620> this<00:04:35.710> would<00:04:35.860> go<00:04:35.950> nice<00:04:36.130> to<00:04:36.370> some<00:04:36.520> Molly

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
I think this would go nice to some Molly

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.970 
I think this would go nice to some Molly
