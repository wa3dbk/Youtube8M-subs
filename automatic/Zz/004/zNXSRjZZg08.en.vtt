00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.350
 hi people this is mister you be 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:10.110
 videos games the games sorry good games 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.290
 video to show a vault 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.949
 I made for the 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.430
 phalenos kingdom with version 1.5.2 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:24.269
 so with the comparators it's 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.779
 really simple these ingenious media 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.449
 we will say that it is almost and the other 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.869
 team can hardly find the room 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.009
 chests 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.149
 unless you have a stroke of luck or 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:39.360
 firmness to blows tnt good images or 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:46.469
 rick a sick society so base king of 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:48.510
 the earth and we arrive in a room 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.940
 ok good this room there would be a 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.250
 stature is really in the room on 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.440
 can see there's no leverage there is no 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.879
 button of the pelletier park which in room 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.449
 chests 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:04.680
 on the other hand there are ovens nothing a 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.689
 field mehdi must tackle is normal 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.820
 it is not it is not something 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.799
 suspicious thing 105 and ovens that's 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.009
 for chorus good things i'm going to you 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.189
 explain a little how it works 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:22.950
 we have a fort in there that is actually 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.130
 to fudge not returned we will not use it 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.200
 will be the one here to use meals 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.310
 to Kurdish pigs be things because 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.130
 that it will allow us to open our 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.390
 room of safe 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.600
 so to open the vault room 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.549
 we need an object that it can be 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:44.100
 anything to retouch point 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:47.360
 michel put it in the body blue 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:52.430
 or the body and red it changes them and 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.430
 boom vault that opens 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.870
 ok I'll explain a little bit how 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:03.130
 it works 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:05.320
 ah yes and if we remove the seychelles the 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.880
 concert hall to do so there we go 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.450
 put it back as an example and that's it 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.520
 that is happening 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.720
 good at the same time massa there is no 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.010
 big thing to take in default but 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.050
 example that tells us should do 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.710
 Monday kingdom must he then raised too much 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.390
 you want it can then really thing 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.040
 to see with labyrinths 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.120
 what does it work anyway? 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.430
 the disadvantage is that you have to have a 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.520
 corner because she bore this name the 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.810
 piston it seems or or beaulieu 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.780
 ways to hide them at the same time but 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.190
 good me I put them in a corner and 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.380
 then how does it work 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.610
 First you surely you will 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.800
 super complicated drawback system 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.800
 there must be plenty of things to have 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:51.310
 to make the system all but for 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:55.030
 true it's super simple so 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.769
 for dory not simple two beds only 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.670
 trick that you need to move this 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:05.080
 that I have in my Arab lover an oven 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:07.390
 a comparator a rip it to enstone down 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.510
 a letter to the leaders and several ex 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.630
 turns today chozen weiten press 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.450
 that after almost no one torch and 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.920
 2 piston at the same time if you want 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.959
 the pistons there may be only 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.799
 1 but it would be annoying example a 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.230
 hole in the ground 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:30.820
 pistons clubs that spend like that 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:33.400
 with like that then south pistons 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.840
 or if you have too much but that's like 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.160
 you see if you did not quote the 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.180
 slime bowl a piston that can be correct 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.549
 but I do it with two tracks 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.739
 so have your vaults if and 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:49.660
 I was doing the managerial system 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:51.459
 so as you see at quick sight that 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.420
 take almost nothing so our aurelie 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:04:00.569
 just here with michel 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:03.870
 so you place a comparator place 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:07.459
 the faso comparator must therefore both 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:10.950
 the dr javed stand aims the var the must 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.600
 you were not going if you can 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.180
 leave like this then I had 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.739
 as high here so there bugs ago 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.530
 with the jacket in her place from the side 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.019
 I do not know why 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.960
 after you place a repeater you 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.900
 can leave it any level 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.639
 it changes nothing at all after you 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.160
 place a hard line and stands you 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.880
 make a reverse flow so a 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.250
 line watson a block a win 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:43.070
 then you place other two others 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:45.600
 raids are here and you vote pistons 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:51.060
 it's really really but really 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:56.430
 simple example that we take away 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:58.820
 the scale that the current is handed these 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:04.650
 and open here to push the udders on 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:08.370
 see there and as you see it's great 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:11.280
 simple is not too expensive then it's 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.860
 perfect because who will think in a 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.160
 brother guillaume to put an object in 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.680
 his chest to open the room good 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.900
 after that are certain that if we arrive 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.699
 right here 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:28.650
 we get here the other team we see this 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:30.300
 not complicated a complicated one we felt 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:36.389
 that small rooms like that pose a 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:37.460
 such in the middle of celebrating is beautiful 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:40.259
 find the vault 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.520
 but after that you still have to when 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:43.229
 even ruined the chests room 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.630
 lighthouse labyrinth example to our most 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:46.919
 deep to the trap does matter but me 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.770
 it was just for the example that I 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.940
 do that I hope they will stay 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.860
 were rare were those who watched 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.599
 the video 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.310
 and then I hope you will use 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:58.620
 in kingdom cliffs 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.560
 what I find I really know 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.659
 something that is ingenious who is 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.639
 inexpensive and that is very hard to 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:08.940
 find 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:12.210
 and on this I tell you no more for 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.310
 other videos then I hope to have you 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.560
 set think to leave a little jacket 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.940
 a room or subscribe 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.970
 it's always nice to have a 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.970
 Subscriber more series everyone
