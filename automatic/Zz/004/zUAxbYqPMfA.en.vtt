video in this next segment we're going
to<00:00:03.929> go<00:00:04.049> over<00:00:04.080> the<00:00:04.350> ingredients<00:00:04.470> used<00:00:05.130> in

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
to go over the ingredients used in

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:06.950 
to go over the ingredients used in
brewing<00:00:05.420> there<00:00:06.420> are<00:00:06.509> four<00:00:06.720> main<00:00:06.930> ingredients

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
brewing there are four main ingredients

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.089 
brewing there are four main ingredients
in<00:00:07.589> brewing<00:00:07.710> there's<00:00:08.370> malt<00:00:08.700> hops<00:00:09.630> yeast<00:00:10.099> and

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
in brewing there's malt hops yeast and

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.879 
in brewing there's malt hops yeast and
water<00:00:11.630> malt<00:00:12.630> is<00:00:12.929> these<00:00:13.259> are<00:00:13.290> going<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.530> come<00:00:13.710> in

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
water malt is these are going to come in

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.460 
water malt is these are going to come in
two<00:00:14.130> different<00:00:14.340> forms<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:15.330> have<00:00:15.540> your<00:00:15.780> malt

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
two different forms you have your malt

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.939 
two different forms you have your malt
extracts<00:00:17.600> get<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.630> dry<00:00:18.990> version<00:00:19.260> which<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:19.800> a

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
extracts get a dry version which is a

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.230 
extracts get a dry version which is a
little<00:00:20.130> more<00:00:20.220> concentrated<00:00:20.910> than<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.090> liquid

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
little more concentrated than the liquid

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.150 
little more concentrated than the liquid
version<00:00:21.630> put<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> little<00:00:22.320> more<00:00:22.439> expensive<00:00:22.740> or

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
version put a little more expensive or

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.730 
version put a little more expensive or
you<00:00:24.150> can<00:00:24.300> get<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.510> liquid<00:00:24.869> extract<00:00:25.260> which<00:00:25.590> is

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
you can get the liquid extract which is

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.609 
you can get the liquid extract which is
like<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.890> very<00:00:26.220> very<00:00:26.640> thick<00:00:26.970> syrup<00:00:27.470> the<00:00:28.470> other

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
like a very very thick syrup the other

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:29.689 
like a very very thick syrup the other
form<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:28.949> malts<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.340> you're<00:00:29.460> going<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.640> be

form of malts that you're going to be

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.730 
form of malts that you're going to be
adding<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.119> really<00:00:30.810> kind<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.109> flesh<00:00:31.320> out<00:00:31.500> the

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
adding to really kind of flesh out the

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.410 
adding to really kind of flesh out the
character<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.520> beer<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:32.820> you're<00:00:32.969> making

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
character of the beer that you're making

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.470 
character of the beer that you're making
our<00:00:33.899> specialty<00:00:34.710> grains<00:00:35.059> these<00:00:36.059> are<00:00:36.239> grains

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
our specialty grains these are grains

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.060 
our specialty grains these are grains
that<00:00:36.660> have<00:00:36.750> been<00:00:36.960> roasted<00:00:37.410> somewhat

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
that have been roasted somewhat

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.740 
that have been roasted somewhat
differently<00:00:38.460> maybe<00:00:38.910> steep<00:00:39.329> for<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> little

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
differently maybe steep for a little

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.290 
differently maybe steep for a little
while<00:00:40.309> and<00:00:41.309> basically<00:00:41.760> they're<00:00:41.969> going<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.180> add

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
while and basically they're going to add

home brewing store will help you mill

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
home brewing store will help you mill
them<00:00:48.780> like<00:00:49.170> this

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.630 

this<00:00:59.620> will<00:00:59.800> open<00:01:00.010> up<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:00.310> grain<00:01:00.460> allowing

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
this will open up the grain allowing

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.660 
this will open up the grain allowing
extraction<00:01:00.940> of<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:01.630> sugar<00:01:01.660> and<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.170> color

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
extraction of the sugar and the color

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.970 
extraction of the sugar and the color
next<00:01:03.670> we<00:01:03.910> have<00:01:04.000> hops<00:01:04.390> and<00:01:05.260> there's<00:01:05.440> two<00:01:05.620> major

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:05.980 
next we have hops and there's two major

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.100 
next we have hops and there's two major
forms<00:01:06.280> of<00:01:06.550> hops<00:01:06.790> that<00:01:06.970> are<00:01:07.060> available<00:01:07.180> there's

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
forms of hops that are available there's

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.050 
forms of hops that are available there's
whole<00:01:08.380> hops<00:01:08.620> which<00:01:09.370> you<00:01:09.490> can<00:01:09.610> see<00:01:09.640> right<00:01:09.760> here

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
whole hops which you can see right here

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.430 
whole hops which you can see right here
this<00:01:10.330> is<00:01:10.390> actually<00:01:10.780> just<00:01:10.870> the<00:01:10.990> code<00:01:11.229> of<00:01:11.260> the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
this is actually just the code of the

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.160 
this is actually just the code of the
hop<00:01:11.680> and<00:01:12.550> there's<00:01:13.000> also<00:01:13.210> pellet<00:01:13.660> hops<00:01:13.810> which

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
hop and there's also pellet hops which

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.760 
hop and there's also pellet hops which
is<00:01:14.350> basically<00:01:15.010> all<00:01:15.460> your<00:01:15.850> whole<00:01:16.720> hops<00:01:16.930> crushed

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
is basically all your whole hops crushed

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.120 
is basically all your whole hops crushed
up<00:01:18.040> and<00:01:18.280> then<00:01:18.400> put<00:01:18.430> into<00:01:18.820> a<00:01:18.850> condensed<00:01:19.330> form

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
up and then put into a condensed form

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.680 
up and then put into a condensed form
the<00:01:21.130> difference<00:01:21.460> is<00:01:21.580> between<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:22.030> two<00:01:22.210> whole

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
the difference is between the two whole

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.830 
the difference is between the two whole
hops<00:01:22.960> tend<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.800> have<00:01:24.340> a<00:01:24.369> shorter<00:01:24.729> shelf<00:01:25.660> life

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
hops tend to have a shorter shelf life

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.260 
hops tend to have a shorter shelf life
or<00:01:26.290> as<00:01:26.440> pellet<00:01:26.770> hops<00:01:26.860> will<00:01:27.070> last<00:01:27.280> longer<00:01:27.550> you

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
or as pellet hops will last longer you

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.700 
or as pellet hops will last longer you
will<00:01:28.570> also<00:01:28.780> get<00:01:29.050> a<00:01:29.110> slightly<00:01:29.410> better

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
will also get a slightly better

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.040 
will also get a slightly better
extraction<00:01:29.830> out<00:01:30.610> of<00:01:30.759> pellet<00:01:31.030> hops<00:01:31.180> than<00:01:31.930> you

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
extraction out of pellet hops than you

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.980 
extraction out of pellet hops than you
will<00:01:32.200> out<00:01:32.229> of<00:01:32.410> whole<00:01:32.649> hops<00:01:33.509> however<00:01:34.509> for

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
will out of whole hops however for

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.780 
will out of whole hops however for
today's<00:01:35.290> purposes<00:01:35.619> in<00:01:36.280> our<00:01:36.460> brewing<00:01:36.759> session

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
today's purposes in our brewing session

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:37.889 
today's purposes in our brewing session
we're<00:01:37.210> going<00:01:37.240> to<00:01:37.390> be<00:01:37.450> using<00:01:37.479> whole<00:01:37.869> hops

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
we're going to be using whole hops

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:39.420 
we're going to be using whole hops
because<00:01:38.440> they're<00:01:38.590> a<00:01:38.619> little<00:01:38.770> easier<00:01:39.190> to<00:01:39.310> get

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
because they're a little easier to get

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.540 
because they're a little easier to get
out<00:01:39.640> of<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:40.149> war<00:01:40.619> ops<00:01:41.619> can<00:01:41.920> add<00:01:42.040> three<00:01:42.310> things

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
out of the war ops can add three things

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.130 
out of the war ops can add three things
to<00:01:42.670> your<00:01:42.790> beer<00:01:42.970> first<00:01:43.540> they<00:01:43.869> can<00:01:44.020> add

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
to your beer first they can add

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.230 
to your beer first they can add
bitterness<00:01:44.350> then<00:01:45.280> they<00:01:45.430> can<00:01:45.550> also<00:01:45.700> add<00:01:45.940> flavor

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
bitterness then they can also add flavor

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.990 
bitterness then they can also add flavor
finally<00:01:47.080> they<00:01:47.200> can<00:01:47.350> add<00:01:47.440> aroma<00:01:47.740> hops<00:01:48.700> which

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
finally they can add aroma hops which

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.120 
finally they can add aroma hops which
are<00:01:49.149> added<00:01:49.270> earlier<00:01:49.750> boil<00:01:50.229> or<00:01:50.560> on<00:01:50.680> the<00:01:50.770> 60

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
are added earlier boil or on the 60

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.580 
are added earlier boil or on the 60
minute<00:01:51.430> time<00:01:51.580> frame<00:01:51.610> will<00:01:52.600> add<00:01:52.660> primarily
