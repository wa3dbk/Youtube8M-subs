00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
so go ahead and load this there we go

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.740 
so go ahead and load this there we go
second<00:01:29.369> time<00:01:29.490> usually<00:01:29.700> works<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.390> there<00:01:30.540> we<00:01:30.720> go

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
second time usually works so there we go

that<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.229> have<00:01:31.350> all<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.650> t-shirts<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:32.130> are

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
that we have all the t-shirts that are

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.890 
that we have all the t-shirts that are
currently<00:01:32.490> available<00:01:32.579> on<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.030> CBS<00:01:33.390> store

time<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.290> go<00:01:34.380> ahead<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.650> just<00:01:34.799> pick<00:01:35.460> one<00:01:35.640> of

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
time to go ahead and just pick one of

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.340 
time to go ahead and just pick one of
these<00:01:35.790> obviously<00:01:36.240> lots<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.570> bazinga<00:01:36.960> stuff

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
these obviously lots of bazinga stuff

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.100 
these obviously lots of bazinga stuff
going<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:37.740> here<00:01:38.130> as<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.240> notice<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.750> physics

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
going on here as you notice the physics

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.390 
going on here as you notice the physics
engine<00:01:40.259> what's<00:01:40.770> going<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.070> talk<00:01:41.159> about<00:01:41.250> the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
engine what's going to talk about the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.440 
engine what's going to talk about the
design<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.820> app<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.210> like<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.420> a

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
design of this app this is like is a

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.660 
design of this app this is like is a
little<00:01:42.720> rough<00:01:42.899> on<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.229> edges<00:01:43.670> specifically

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
little rough on the edges specifically

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.490 
little rough on the edges specifically
in<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.880> physics<00:01:45.299> like<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.780> sliding<00:01:46.140> physics

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
in the physics like the sliding physics

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.920 
in the physics like the sliding physics
are<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.649> bit<00:01:46.860> odd<00:01:47.540> sometimes<00:01:48.540> they<00:01:48.840> don't

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
are a bit odd sometimes they don't

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.389 
are a bit odd sometimes they don't
really<00:01:49.110> quite<00:01:49.380> slide<00:01:49.740> where<00:01:49.950> we<00:01:50.040> would<00:01:50.130> expect

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
really quite slide where we would expect

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.280 
really quite slide where we would expect
them<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.820> Bnei<00:01:51.149> it's<00:01:51.390> no<00:01:51.540> great<00:01:51.689> loss<00:01:51.990> other

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
them to Bnei it's no great loss other

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.170 
them to Bnei it's no great loss other
than<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.860> design<00:01:53.100> itself<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.640> just<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.939> little

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
than the design itself is just a little

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.179 
than the design itself is just a little
rough<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.509> terms<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.840> design<00:01:55.290> aspects<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.040> we

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
rough in terms of design aspects that we

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.469 
rough in terms of design aspects that we
kind<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.369> look<00:01:56.490> for<00:01:56.640> we<00:01:56.790> our<00:01:56.880> designers<00:01:57.360> so

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
kind of look for we our designers so

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.050 
kind of look for we our designers so
we're<00:01:57.600> kind<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.750> picky<00:01:58.189> but<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.610> aesthetics

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
we're kind of picky but the aesthetics

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.789 
we're kind of picky but the aesthetics
of<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.420> little<00:02:00.509> rough<00:02:00.659> but<00:02:01.350> not<00:02:01.560> not<00:02:01.770> a

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
of it a little rough but not not a

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.649 
of it a little rough but not not a
deal-breaker<00:02:02.070> there<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:03.180> we<00:02:03.270> go<00:02:03.420> ahead<00:02:03.450> and

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
deal-breaker there so we go ahead and

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.899 
deal-breaker there so we go ahead and
load<00:02:03.780> one<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.079> these<00:02:04.200> shirts<00:02:04.520> you<00:02:05.520> can<00:02:05.640> hit<00:02:05.729> by

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
load one of these shirts you can hit by

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.999 
load one of these shirts you can hit by
now<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.149> can<00:02:06.390> also<00:02:06.509> share<00:02:06.659> this<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.860> your

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
now you can also share this to your

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.320 
now you can also share this to your
friends<00:02:08.220> if<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.670> would<00:02:08.819> like<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.270> think

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
friends if you would like I think

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.390 
friends if you would like I think
actually<00:02:09.629> hit<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.229> information<00:02:11.069> button

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
actually hit the information button

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.559 
actually hit the information button
which<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:11.819> didn't<00:02:12.000> mean<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.180> do

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
which I didn't mean to do

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.270 
which I didn't mean to do
there's<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.379> if<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.650> want<00:02:13.799> to<00:02:13.890> see<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.129> but

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
there's that if you want to see that but

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.470 
there's that if you want to see that but
instead<00:02:14.459> I<00:02:14.519> want<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.790> do<00:02:14.879> hit<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.180> share

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
instead I want to do hit the share

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.970 
instead I want to do hit the share
button<00:02:15.510> because<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:15.989> can<00:02:16.079> say<00:02:16.260> share<00:02:16.650> this<00:02:16.799> to

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
button because you can say share this to

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.440 
button because you can say share this to
twitter<00:02:17.129> or<00:02:17.400> facebook<00:02:17.609> or<00:02:17.879> more<00:02:18.090> if<00:02:18.239> you<00:02:18.329> would

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
twitter or facebook or more if you would

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.119 
twitter or facebook or more if you would
like<00:02:18.629> and<00:02:18.870> if<00:02:19.200> you'd<00:02:19.319> like<00:02:19.439> to<00:02:19.499> hit<00:02:19.709> by<00:02:19.950> now

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
like and if you'd like to hit by now

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.250 
like and if you'd like to hit by now
then<00:02:20.879> it<00:02:20.999> loads<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.359> page<00:02:21.569> where<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:21.930> can<00:02:21.959> in

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
then it loads the page where you can in

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.110 
then it loads the page where you can in
fact<00:02:22.290> by<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.709> t-shirt<00:02:23.159> now<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:23.700> all<00:02:23.909> of<00:02:23.939> this

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120

remains<00:02:24.480> an<00:02:24.689> app<00:02:24.930> there's<00:02:25.200> no<00:02:25.439> need<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:25.920> go<00:02:26.459> to

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
remains an app there's no need to go to
