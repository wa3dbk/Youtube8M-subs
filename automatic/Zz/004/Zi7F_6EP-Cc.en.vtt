 viral darth vader to go to another planet 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.750
 I could not turn the tables but the risk 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.360
 that she talked about the toyota pickup on the floor 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.250

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.310
 neodi empire demo has to advance until 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.430

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.510
 radio and radio time I left 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.000
 control said he calls an attack 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.159
 lewis bomber if you can 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.590
 call so many attacks you destroy the 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:45.599
 furniture and collection of these floor games 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.299
 that only makes them vulnerable are 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.250
 known as the electric wine spokes 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.099
 and when they are vulnerable 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.620
 to the ships that you're getting into. 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.109
 bullet in them you get out throwing sugar 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.810
 they or if you have with the gifts daughter 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:03.659

 will act around the legs to knock down 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:09.150
 It was two games today. 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.870
 matches of that match of plus or minus 15 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.540
 minutes 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.239
 I managed to find a curious empire 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.599
 which made me control the organ if I did not 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.970
 born an ok you were born there 60 and 30 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.739
 no no battlefield you have to get 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.400
 in the rock you control during the 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:30.610
 time you in using the special weapons 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:34.239
 works is very cool guy game is fine 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.890
 fun is fast and dynamic and 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.629
 Now I really liked that you got the 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.280
 things on the floor because you never know 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.739
 What are you going to pick up you can pick up? 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.780
 Anything you do not have to do is kill 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.890
 Ten guys and die for you. 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.269
 personal attack 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.129
 anyone can be the attack 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.410
 of existing makes it a 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:53.500
 More democratic game for who is good 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.060
 For what it is a mistake, I really liked it. 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.090
 star wars battlefront the new venture 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.159
 will work just as well as for the 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.329
 less dengue maps also players 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.040
 playing previous 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.709
 I think it's a kick-start to 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.220
 great games today this will be a 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.220
