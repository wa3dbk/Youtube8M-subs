00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.050
 sextet of clouds atlas then 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.580
 that in addition to four or five copies of 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.580
 less 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.580
 the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.660
 that is the music of my dream to write 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.009
 whole movements imagining that we 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.950
 we found again and again in 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:31.560
 different lives at different times not 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.559
 I can explain it but as soon as I opened that 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.640
 super guru door overwhelming her 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.829
 I saw my entire body 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.140
 I heard it in a dream and I was in a 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:44.820
 spooky restaurant and all the 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.820
 Waitresses had the same face 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.970
 do not hide, I know who you are, they are a thousand 451 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.260
 Yesterday 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.460
 my life was going in one direction 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.720
 today 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.970
 I dance back 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.659
 have you ever believed that the universe 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:18.780
 he was in his room getting to believe 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.999
 love actions that determine the direction of 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.100
 our lives these forces begin 

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:26.689
 long before our birth and 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.689
 they survive our disappearance 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.530
 in our lives they do not belong to us 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.210
 we are united to others 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:48.290
 in the past and in the present 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.250
 and like every crime 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.250
 in every kind gesture 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.560
 it is our future 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.510
 14 and stop going 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.509
 I think there is another world waiting for us 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.509
 a better world
