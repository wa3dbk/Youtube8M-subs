00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.700
 Well, it's good, I'll play so that the last section where to study 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.280
 some general rules of behavior for example 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:12.219
 the blissful first mobile question 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:13.529
 look at the picture 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:16.640
 what the unpresentable is doing that by the way in it 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.699
 correct correct 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.570
 totally incorrect in this way 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.169
 can not answer a phone call because it is because very dangerous 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.939
 loses a lot of attention driving 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.669
 they're going to ask you what runs only the most frequent accident by the 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.840
 use of the mobile in this way 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.160
 Frontolateral collisions 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.270
 that is, they hit you optics in front and on the one hand 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.820
 talked about the scope of the collisions by reach by scope that 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.479
 they ask you 

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:49.170
 behind 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.130
 neither 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.050
 answers 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.290
 the most frequent accident I use the exits 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.820
 the afternoon 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.049
 that my cell phone rings and while I do not look for it 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:05.129
 I'm not looking at the road has the curve and highlighted by what spoke bowl 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:05.710
 luso 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.119
 calmed the body 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.039
 he also moves the wheel and saved me 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.840
 on the other hand 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.050
 side exits 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.630
 this means that you can never ever answer a call from your mobile 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.810
 if you get answered 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.889
 as long as you have a free hand device 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.220
 be a device 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.040
 that do not require the use of the hand nor 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.430
 of headphones 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.479
 the pinganillo 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.149
 Solid tobaline has to come out through an independent loudspeaker 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.480
 understands that although this legal thing can be done 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.700
 it's still dangerous and still dangerous 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.550
 for two things first for the fact of looking to die 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.030
 the little button to contact language 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.800
 and also for what is called the surprise effect 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.450
 the surprise effect good because I'm driving so happy a fraud 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.050
 and suddenly host 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.910
 of day and nelson character of the call 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.080
 well, you cabbage the grass before dangerous 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.560
 also 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.909
 you are going to recommend us never get over 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:11.579
 the soft minute 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:16.430
 knut and asked forgiveness talking on the mobile because because from here 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.099
 it means to spend more on the conversation 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.170
 what is 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.749
 driving to see that explain this is not to be prohibited 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:27.819
 nova and a civil guard changed with a chronometer controlling the time of 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.749
 absurd can be more than a minute and a half yes 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:32.989
 but it is recommended 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.169
 dangers 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:35.869
 the next nor positive 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:38.829
 that they finish contract nowadays it is used much pÃ©rez 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.229
 the gps 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:44.629
 abed point to have with the gps the gps can I remember ap 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.819
 but it can also make you 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.239
 lose attention in driving therefore 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.150
 It is totally forbidden to put all the gps on while driving to the 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.149
 gps 

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:57.619
 you have to program it 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:00.169
 before you start driving 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:04.989
 this gps is not enough that they went to local kiko because it's been a while since 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.429
 in some place 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:08.640
 where the vision does not prevent you 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.129
 Of the road 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.340
 the gps 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.880
 is going to say many things in agreement 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.180
 but that this p the trial of the counted 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:19.809
 or the gps 

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:21.499
 the judgment of the driver 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:24.599
 just like gps tells you that you have this street for delight 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.400
 but it turns out that the city council is doing work and has just cut it 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.889
 not to get inside the couple because the cts says it 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:33.859
 the gps 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.059
 It will also mark the speed of the car lose 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:39.879
 but it has one drawback that the next 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.260
 while the gps has coverage 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.020
 it's going pretty good but when it loses satellite coverage because they get you 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.679
 a site with tall building whatever 

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:50.679
 he goes crazy 

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:55.009
 let me tell you that it goes over the building that circulated 160 I do not know 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:56.649
 how many barbarities 

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:59.669
 therefore, understand that even if you mark the speed 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:02.239
 has to prevail vale ma 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.679
 the car speedometer the needle 

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:05.829
 what is worth 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.019
 memory 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.339
 more little things 

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:12.909
 fiat in this other unpresentable right or wrong totally wrong 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.679
 drive with headphones 

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:18.569
 hear me left my car parked tonight 

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:21.879
 and with delegate in the morning buzek have done in the field 

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:23.919
 but look how he's fucking 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:29.080
 I can put on as the blonde has to wash the car in the middle of the 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.099
 half way street 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:34.629
 this is also totally prohibited 

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:37.389
 and the last thing I'll explain 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:42.060
 that you know that your country is totally forbidden to red prejudice you for the 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.999
 window for two things 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:45.779
 first because the matter 

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:48.779
 and second because it can cause an accident 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:55.129
 in particular it is forbidden to throw as objects that can produce a 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:56.550
 fire for example 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:57.680
 a cigarette butt 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.020
 careful with eto'o that if you catch entity a butt 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.610
 you can lose 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.610
 four points I was not wrong four points 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.889
 And you know what 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.840
 So what is this issue that is the first one that could be optimistic that 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.139
 come and tampoc the apartment 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:16.500
 you only have left 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.750
 efe the last question in this section and then 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.009
 is going to have to do hunted 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:24.889
 with all the question 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:26.249
 of this topic 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:28.580
 they encourage 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.790
 and luck with him you know 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:31.530
 that we are the best
