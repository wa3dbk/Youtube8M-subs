this<00:00:20.789> presentation<00:00:22.519> we're<00:00:23.519> going<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.730> begin

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
this presentation we're going to begin

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.120 
this presentation we're going to begin
by<00:00:24.060> changing<00:00:24.779> out<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.320> material<00:00:25.769> to

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
by changing out the material to

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.920 
by changing out the material to
something<00:00:26.490> gray<00:00:26.699> I'm<00:00:27.300> going<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.570> select<00:00:27.779> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
something gray I'm going to select the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.480 
something gray I'm going to select the
model<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.500> I'm<00:00:28.590> immediately<00:00:29.070> going<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.340> go

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
model and I'm immediately going to go

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.250 
model and I'm immediately going to go
into<00:00:29.789> my<00:00:29.880> graphite<00:00:30.300> modeling<00:00:30.750> tools<00:00:30.960> and

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
into my graphite modeling tools and

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.380 
into my graphite modeling tools and
we're<00:00:32.189> going<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.340> change<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.790> smoothing<00:00:33.180> from

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
we're going to change the smoothing from

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.880 
we're going to change the smoothing from
smooth<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.870> hard<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.290> we<00:00:34.469> can<00:00:34.620> see<00:00:34.739> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
smooth to hard so that we can see the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.459 
smooth to hard so that we can see the
topology<00:00:35.360> I'm<00:00:36.360> also<00:00:36.570> going<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.870> go<00:00:36.989> ahead<00:00:37.110> and

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
topology I'm also going to go ahead and

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.700 
topology I'm also going to go ahead and
enter<00:00:37.760> edged<00:00:38.760> face<00:00:39.120> mode<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.690> I'm<00:00:40.530> going<00:00:40.649> to

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
enter edged face mode and I'm going to

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.110 
enter edged face mode and I'm going to
enter<00:00:40.860> edge<00:00:41.160> mode<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.610> we're<00:00:41.730> going<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.879> take

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
enter edge mode and we're going to take

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.720 
enter edge mode and we're going to take
a<00:00:42.149> look<00:00:42.390> at<00:00:42.570> some<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.899> new<00:00:42.989> edge<00:00:43.200> tools<00:00:43.730> so

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
a look at some of the new edge tools so

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.979 
a look at some of the new edge tools so
you<00:00:44.820> can<00:00:44.940> see<00:00:45.090> we<00:00:45.239> already<00:00:45.390> have<00:00:45.510> some<00:00:45.809> really

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
you can see we already have some really

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.650 
you can see we already have some really
nice<00:00:46.170> clean<00:00:46.469> geometry<00:00:47.129> here<00:00:47.370> we've<00:00:48.090> added<00:00:48.329> a

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
nice clean geometry here we've added a

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.420 
nice clean geometry here we've added a
number<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.960> new<00:00:49.079> selection<00:00:49.680> tools<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.190> allow

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
number of new selection tools that allow

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.360 
number of new selection tools that allow
us<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.610> quickly<00:00:51.050> create<00:00:52.050> new<00:00:52.530> selections<00:00:53.160> in

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
us to quickly create new selections in

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.209 
us to quickly create new selections in
an<00:00:53.850> interactive<00:00:54.270> manner<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.899> have<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.129> ability

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
an interactive manner I have the ability

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.549 
an interactive manner I have the ability
to<00:00:56.520> selectively<00:00:57.120> grow<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.840> shrink<00:00:58.050> my<00:00:58.410> edge

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
to selectively grow and shrink my edge

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.340 
to selectively grow and shrink my edge
selections<00:00:59.190> or<00:00:59.370> my<00:00:59.489> ring<00:00:59.699> selections<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.449> can

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
selections or my ring selections I can

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.439 
selections or my ring selections I can
do<00:01:01.469> loop<00:01:01.739> selections<00:01:02.520> as<00:01:02.789> well<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.239> same

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
do loop selections as well in the same

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.200 
do loop selections as well in the same
way<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.710> course<00:01:05.010> we<00:01:05.189> can<00:01:05.369> grow<00:01:05.580> outward<00:01:06.060> in

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
way and of course we can grow outward in

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.210 
way and of course we can grow outward in
all<00:01:06.360> directions<00:01:06.420> just<00:01:07.140> like<00:01:07.799> we<00:01:08.040> could

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
all directions just like we could

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.149 
all directions just like we could
previously<00:01:09.140> another<00:01:10.140> really<00:01:10.409> great<00:01:10.619> tool<00:01:10.920> is

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
previously another really great tool is

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.490 
previously another really great tool is
the<00:01:11.220> loop<00:01:11.490> mode<00:01:11.880> loop<00:01:12.570> mode<00:01:12.780> allows<00:01:13.080> us<00:01:13.350> to

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
the loop mode loop mode allows us to

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.899 
the loop mode loop mode allows us to
quickly<00:01:13.740> select<00:01:14.189> any<00:01:14.900> entire<00:01:16.130> loop<00:01:17.130> as<00:01:17.340> it

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
quickly select any entire loop as it

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.550 
quickly select any entire loop as it
goes<00:01:18.060> around<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.390> model<00:01:18.600> with<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.140> simply

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
goes around the model with this simply

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.890 
goes around the model with this simply
by<00:01:19.680> selecting<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:20.280> one<00:01:20.490> edge<00:01:20.700> same<00:01:21.600> goes<00:01:21.869> for

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
by selecting on one edge same goes for

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.649 
by selecting on one edge same goes for
ring<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.530> can<00:01:22.770> select<00:01:23.070> on<00:01:23.280> any<00:01:23.460> ring<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.000> it'll

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
ring I can select on any ring and it'll

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.240 
ring I can select on any ring and it'll
select<00:01:24.930> all<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.259> way<00:01:25.350> around<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.740> model<00:01:25.950> as

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
select all the way around the model as

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.469 
select all the way around the model as
long<00:01:26.759> as<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.030> finds<00:01:27.950> contiguous<00:01:28.950> rings

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
long as it finds contiguous rings

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.850 
long as it finds contiguous rings
another<00:01:30.479> interesting<00:01:31.020> tool<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.350> we<00:01:31.439> have<00:01:31.470> is

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
another interesting tool that we have is

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.210 
another interesting tool that we have is
what<00:01:32.009> we<00:01:32.040> call<00:01:32.540> dot<00:01:33.540> ring<00:01:33.900> which<00:01:34.530> allows<00:01:34.829> me<00:01:35.070> to

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
what we call dot ring which allows me to

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.450 
what we call dot ring which allows me to
essentially<00:01:35.790> skip<00:01:36.420> over<00:01:36.659> any<00:01:37.100> predefined<00:01:38.100> set

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
essentially skip over any predefined set

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.670 
essentially skip over any predefined set
number<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.820> edges<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.390> want<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.409> case

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
number of edges that I want in this case

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.270 
number of edges that I want in this case
I'm<00:01:40.950> skipping<00:01:41.549> every<00:01:42.119> other<00:01:42.299> edge<00:01:43.040> this<00:01:44.040> can

the model that I can then remove and
quickly<00:01:56.909> do<00:01:57.590> polygon<00:01:58.590> reduction<00:01:58.740> in<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.399> very

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
quickly do polygon reduction in a very

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.090 
quickly do polygon reduction in a very
clean<00:01:59.880> manner<00:02:00.619> without<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.649> lot<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.040> extra<00:02:02.369> work

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
clean manner without a lot of extra work

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.990 
clean manner without a lot of extra work
another<00:02:05.100> interesting<00:02:05.579> tool<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.880> we've

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
another interesting tool that we've

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.690 
another interesting tool that we've
added<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.630> Swift<00:02:07.200> loop<00:02:07.380> Swift<00:02:08.280> loop<00:02:08.489> is

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
added is Swift loop Swift loop is

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.140 
added is Swift loop Swift loop is
essentially<00:02:09.390> edge<00:02:10.170> ring<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.830> connect<00:02:11.520> all<00:02:11.670> in

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
essentially edge ring and connect all in

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.850 
essentially edge ring and connect all in
one<00:02:12.360> mouse<00:02:13.080> click

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
one mouse click

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.680 
one mouse click
so<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.280> can<00:02:14.490> see<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:14.850> I<00:02:14.940> can<00:02:14.970> quickly<00:02:15.390> add

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
so you can see that I can quickly add

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.980 
so you can see that I can quickly add
new<00:02:15.930> geometry<00:02:16.260> any<00:02:16.890> place<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:17.880> want<00:02:18.180> truly

new geometry any place that I want truly

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.500 
new geometry any place that I want truly
an<00:02:19.140> artist<00:02:19.500> driven<00:02:19.890> tool<00:02:20.070> another<00:02:21.030> really

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
an artist driven tool another really

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.840 
an artist driven tool another really
interesting<00:02:21.540> application<00:02:22.350> of<00:02:23.160> Swift<00:02:23.460> loop<00:02:23.610> is

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
interesting application of Swift loop is

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.520 
interesting application of Swift loop is
the<00:02:24.000> fact<00:02:24.240> that<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.450> also<00:02:24.690> have<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.110> ability<00:02:25.500> to

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
the fact that I also have the ability to

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.460 
the fact that I also have the ability to
go<00:02:25.800> in<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.420> interactively<00:02:27.420> decide<00:02:27.870> where<00:02:28.440> I

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
go in and interactively decide where I

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.920 
go in and interactively decide where I
want<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.070> loop<00:02:29.250> after<00:02:29.700> I<00:02:30.210> placed<00:02:30.660> it

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
want the loop after I placed it

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.100 
want the loop after I placed it
something<00:02:31.920> previously<00:02:32.160> not<00:02:32.640> seen<00:02:33.030> in<00:02:33.330> 3ds<00:02:33.840> max

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
something previously not seen in 3ds max

something previously not seen in 3ds max
before<00:02:37.250> once<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.400> have<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.760> ring<00:02:38.910> in<00:02:38.940> there

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
before once I have the ring in there

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.360 
before once I have the ring in there
let's<00:02:39.960> say<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:40.350> decide<00:02:40.470> that<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:40.980> want<00:02:41.250> to

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
let's say that I decide that I want to

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.400 
let's say that I decide that I want to
move<00:02:41.520> it<00:02:41.670> I've<00:02:42.270> moved<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:42.870> but<00:02:43.050> let's<00:02:43.200> say<00:02:43.350> I

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
move it I've moved it but let's say I

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.320 
move it I've moved it but let's say I
need<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.710> redefine<00:02:44.250> where<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:44.820> goes<00:02:44.970> you

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
need to redefine where it goes you

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.390 
need to redefine where it goes you
notice<00:02:45.990> that<00:02:46.140> we<00:02:46.260> have<00:02:46.500> some<00:02:46.770> edge<00:02:46.950> loops<00:02:47.220> that

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
set flow to take that ring and

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.670 
set flow to take that ring and

see<00:03:50.340> that<00:03:50.820> all<00:03:51.239> of<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.780> extra<00:03:52.140> sculpting<00:03:52.560> that

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
see that all of the extra sculpting that

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.320 
see that all of the extra sculpting that
would<00:03:52.830> have<00:03:52.920> taken<00:03:53.040> place<00:03:53.250> previously<00:03:54.000> is<00:03:54.150> no

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
would have taken place previously is no

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.780 
would have taken place previously is no
longer<00:03:54.630> present<00:03:55.019> so<00:03:56.010> you<00:03:56.040> can<00:03:56.280> see<00:03:56.459> that<00:03:56.640> there

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
longer present so you can see that there

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.310 
longer present so you can see that there
are<00:03:56.820> many<00:03:57.150> new<00:03:57.540> edge<00:03:57.720> tools<00:03:58.050> that<00:03:58.230> are

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
are many new edge tools that are

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.160 
are many new edge tools that are
available<00:03:58.560> to<00:03:58.920> us<00:03:58.950> and<00:03:59.280> therefore<00:04:00.060> very<00:04:00.690> quick

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
available to us and therefore very quick

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.500 
available to us and therefore very quick
organic<00:04:02.070> and<00:04:02.239> artist<00:04:03.239> driven<00:04:03.660> workflows<00:04:05.510> one

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
organic and artist driven workflows one

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.729 
organic and artist driven workflows one
last<00:04:06.690> thing<00:04:06.870> we're<00:04:07.019> going<00:04:07.110> to<00:04:07.170> look<00:04:07.380> at<00:04:07.560> with

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
last thing we're going to look at with

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.310 
last thing we're going to look at with
edge<00:04:07.890> loops<00:04:08.160> are<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.459> loop<00:04:08.640> tools<00:04:08.880> themselves

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
edge loops are the loop tools themselves

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.789 
edge loops are the loop tools themselves
so<00:04:10.320> if<00:04:10.410> we<00:04:10.530> open<00:04:11.250> up<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.489> loop<00:04:11.670> tools<00:04:12.799> palette

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
so if we open up the loop tools palette

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.740 
so if we open up the loop tools palette
we<00:04:14.580> can<00:04:14.670> come<00:04:14.790> down<00:04:14.940> here<00:04:15.390> and<00:04:15.540> start

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
we can come down here and start

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.210 
we can come down here and start
selecting<00:04:16.260> some<00:04:16.470> edges<00:04:16.709> so<00:04:16.799> you<00:04:16.859> can<00:04:17.040> see<00:04:17.190> I

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
selecting some edges so you can see I

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.400 
selecting some edges so you can see I
have<00:04:17.400> some<00:04:17.580> like<00:04:17.760> edges<00:04:18.269> here<00:04:18.540> if<00:04:19.200> I<00:04:19.380> just

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
have some like edges here if I just

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.050 
have some like edges here if I just
select<00:04:19.919> a<00:04:20.010> number<00:04:20.280> of<00:04:20.370> edges<00:04:20.700> and<00:04:20.850> choose

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
select a number of edges and choose

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.180 
select a number of edges and choose
Center<00:04:21.390> it<00:04:21.900> automatically<00:04:22.470> centers<00:04:22.830> up<00:04:23.039> our

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
Center it automatically centers up our

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.490 
Center it automatically centers up our
edges<00:04:23.520> that<00:04:23.729> allows<00:04:24.360> us<00:04:24.390> to<00:04:24.720> relax<00:04:25.020> them<00:04:25.350> and

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
edges that allows us to relax them and

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.350 
edges that allows us to relax them and
really<00:04:26.190> just<00:04:26.520> gain<00:04:26.789> better

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
really just gain better

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.170 
really just gain better
roll<00:04:27.539> over<00:04:27.750> our<00:04:28.020> topology<00:04:28.669> as<00:04:29.669> we<00:04:29.939> move

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
roll over our topology as we move

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.540 
roll over our topology as we move
through<00:04:30.389> the<00:04:30.479> modeling<00:04:30.840> pipeline<00:04:31.289> so<00:04:32.159> you<00:04:32.250> can

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
through the modeling pipeline so you can

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.219 
through the modeling pipeline so you can
see<00:04:32.759> that<00:04:32.909> there<00:04:33.090> are<00:04:33.120> a<00:04:33.210> lot<00:04:33.419> of<00:04:33.449> new<00:04:33.750> tools

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
see that there are a lot of new tools

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.020 
see that there are a lot of new tools
and<00:04:34.439> capabilities<00:04:35.129> within<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.520> graphite

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
and capabilities within the graphite

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.300 
and capabilities within the graphite
modeling<00:04:36.479> tools<00:04:36.770> specifically<00:04:37.770> within<00:04:38.069> edge

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
modeling tools specifically within edge

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.580 
modeling tools specifically within edge
