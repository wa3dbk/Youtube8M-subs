think in the history of humanity we are

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.650 
think in the history of humanity we are
now<00:02:21.200> beginning<00:02:21.590> to<00:02:21.920> understand<00:02:22.640> that<00:02:23.180> we

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
now beginning to understand that we

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.720 
now beginning to understand that we
humans<00:02:24.260> are<00:02:25.210> maybe<00:02:26.680> damaging<00:02:27.680> this<00:02:27.920> planet<00:02:28.490> to

humans are maybe damaging this planet to
the<00:02:28.760> point<00:02:29.180> where<00:02:29.950> significant<00:02:30.950> reduction<00:02:31.700> in

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
the point where significant reduction in

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.140 
the point where significant reduction in
capacity<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:32.990> sustain<00:02:33.200> our<00:02:33.890> own<00:02:34.190> lives<00:02:34.610> and

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
capacity to sustain our own lives and

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.520 
capacity to sustain our own lives and
the<00:02:35.270> lives<00:02:35.300> of<00:02:35.780> our<00:02:35.960> children<00:02:36.020> and

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
the lives of our children and

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.890 
the lives of our children and
grandchildren<00:02:36.590> is<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.910> result<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.660> so

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
grandchildren is the result and so

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.940 
grandchildren is the result and so
there's<00:02:39.470> just<00:02:39.830> a<00:02:40.450> huge<00:02:41.450> imperative<00:02:42.410> that<00:02:42.470> the

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
there's just a huge imperative that the

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.850 
there's just a huge imperative that the
knowledge<00:02:43.190> level<00:02:43.670> around<00:02:44.660> these<00:02:45.050> issues<00:02:45.080> be

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
knowledge level around these issues be

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.699 
knowledge level around these issues be
expanded<00:02:46.490> in<00:02:46.580> our<00:02:46.760> population<00:02:47.060> and<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:48.650> think

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
expanded in our population and I think

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.240 
expanded in our population and I think
green<00:02:49.340> charter<00:02:50.180> schools<00:02:50.570> is<00:02:51.020> one<00:02:51.440> example<00:02:51.650> of

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
green charter schools is one example of

00:02:52.250 --> 00:03:00.020 
green charter schools is one example of
a<00:02:52.370> way<00:02:52.550> to<00:02:52.610> accomplish<00:02:53.090> that

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.740 

I<00:03:01.250> think<00:03:02.250> education<00:03:02.400> is<00:03:03.000> at<00:03:03.270> the<00:03:03.390> core<00:03:03.720> of

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
I think education is at the core of

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.600 
I think education is at the core of
having<00:03:04.380> a<00:03:04.470> sustainable<00:03:05.010> society<00:03:05.190> we

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
having a sustainable society we

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.040 
having a sustainable society we
absolutely<00:03:05.910> have<00:03:06.390> to<00:03:06.540> rethink<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:07.020> way

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
absolutely have to rethink the way

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.960 
absolutely have to rethink the way
education<00:03:07.740> is<00:03:07.950> we<00:03:08.940> have<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.240> we<00:03:10.020> have<00:03:10.050> to<00:03:10.970> help

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
education is we have to we have to help

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.120 
education is we have to we have to help
kids<00:03:12.240> become<00:03:12.690> critical<00:03:13.319> thinkers<00:03:13.350> to<00:03:13.680> create

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
kids become critical thinkers to create

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.620 
kids become critical thinkers to create
a<00:03:14.190> sustainable<00:03:14.400> society<00:03:14.819> because<00:03:15.330> what<00:03:15.510> we

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
a sustainable society because what we

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.059 
a sustainable society because what we
have<00:03:15.810> right<00:03:15.959> now<00:03:16.020> we<00:03:16.200> know<00:03:16.470> isn't<00:03:16.709> going<00:03:16.980> to

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
have right now we know isn't going to

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:22.340 
have right now we know isn't going to
last<00:03:17.550> us<00:03:17.850> I<00:03:19.580> think<00:03:20.580> if<00:03:20.880> things<00:03:21.720> continue<00:03:21.959> the

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
last us I think if things continue the

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.370 
last us I think if things continue the
way<00:03:22.560> they're<00:03:22.950> going<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:24.319> movement<00:03:25.319> for

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
way they're going and the movement for

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.380 
way they're going and the movement for
charter<00:03:25.860> schools<00:03:25.890> keeps<00:03:26.520> going<00:03:26.880> at<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.360> rate

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
charter schools keeps going at the rate

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.350 
charter schools keeps going at the rate
it<00:03:27.720> is<00:03:27.870> people<00:03:28.620> will<00:03:29.010> begin<00:03:29.430> to<00:03:29.610> open<00:03:30.030> their

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
it is people will begin to open their

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:39.620 
it is people will begin to open their
minds<00:03:30.780> to<00:03:30.810> new<00:03:31.080> ideas<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:38.300> think<00:03:39.300> one<00:03:39.450> of<00:03:39.480> the

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
minds to new ideas I think one of the

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.960 
minds to new ideas I think one of the
strong<00:03:39.900> resources<00:03:40.500> that<00:03:40.709> we<00:03:40.890> have<00:03:41.100> within<00:03:41.489> our

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
strong resources that we have within our

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.330 
strong resources that we have within our
whole<00:03:42.300> chunk<00:03:42.540> nation<00:03:42.959> right<00:03:43.620> now<00:03:43.650> is<00:03:43.920> that<00:03:44.100> we

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
whole chunk nation right now is that we

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.309 
whole chunk nation right now is that we
still<00:03:44.370> have<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:47.360> whole<00:03:48.360> truck<00:03:48.540> language<00:03:49.019> and

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
still have the whole truck language and

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.990 
still have the whole truck language and
I<00:03:49.560> think<00:03:49.800> the<00:03:50.010> important<00:03:50.459> part<00:03:50.700> here<00:03:50.790> is

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
I think the important part here is

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.380 
I think the important part here is
putting<00:03:54.000> together<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:54.720> idea<00:03:55.080> of<00:03:56.390> language

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
putting together the idea of language

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.600 
putting together the idea of language
and<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:58.590> environmental<00:04:00.380> landscape<00:04:01.459> for<00:04:02.459> each

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
and the environmental landscape for each

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.870 
and the environmental landscape for each
child<00:04:03.150> and<00:04:03.569> I<00:04:04.350> think<00:04:04.590> once<00:04:04.799> you<00:04:04.950> put<00:04:05.220> these<00:04:05.610> two

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
child and I think once you put these two

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.930 
child and I think once you put these two
elements<00:04:06.060> together<00:04:06.570> there<00:04:07.049> is<00:04:07.079> going<00:04:07.410> to<00:04:07.620> be

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
elements together there is going to be

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.000 
elements together there is going to be
this<00:04:08.940> dynamic<00:04:09.750> connection<00:04:10.350> that<00:04:10.560> happens

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
this dynamic connection that happens

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.580 
this dynamic connection that happens
where<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:11.940> kid<00:04:12.209> feels<00:04:12.570> connected<00:04:13.110> to<00:04:13.470> the

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
where the kid feels connected to the

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.250 
where the kid feels connected to the
world

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.510 

too<00:04:21.260> often<00:04:21.470> times<00:04:21.859> when<00:04:22.100> we<00:04:22.190> talked<00:04:22.430> about

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
too often times when we talked about

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.980 
too often times when we talked about
environmental<00:04:23.060> education<00:04:23.540> we<00:04:23.660> talked<00:04:23.840> about

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
environmental education we talked about

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.260 
environmental education we talked about
daily<00:04:24.950> celebrations<00:04:25.730> where<00:04:25.970> we<00:04:26.060> maybe

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
daily celebrations where we maybe

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.570 
daily celebrations where we maybe
celebrate<00:04:26.720> Earth<00:04:26.930> Day<00:04:26.960> or<00:04:27.410> we<00:04:27.530> have<00:04:27.710> Arbor<00:04:28.550> Day

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
celebrate Earth Day or we have Arbor Day

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.370 
celebrate Earth Day or we have Arbor Day
and<00:04:29.000> then<00:04:29.389> we<00:04:29.570> forget<00:04:29.870> about<00:04:29.900> it<00:04:30.169> for<00:04:30.290> the<00:04:30.350> rest

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
and then we forget about it for the rest

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.740 
and then we forget about it for the rest
of<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:30.740> year<00:04:30.980> in<00:04:31.730> a<00:04:31.850> green<00:04:32.090> school<00:04:32.510> and

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
of the year in a green school and

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.180 
of the year in a green school and
hopefully<00:04:33.320> eventually<00:04:33.500> at<00:04:33.800> all<00:04:33.919> of<00:04:34.100> our

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
hopefully eventually at all of our

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.100 
hopefully eventually at all of our
schools<00:04:34.580> this<00:04:35.270> will<00:04:35.419> be<00:04:35.480> an<00:04:35.570> issue<00:04:35.690> that<00:04:35.840> will

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
schools this will be an issue that will

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.320 
schools this will be an issue that will
be<00:04:36.320> in<00:04:36.830> front<00:04:37.070> of<00:04:37.160> students<00:04:37.490> on<00:04:37.550> a<00:04:37.580> daily<00:04:37.669> basis

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
be in front of students on a daily basis

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.970 
be in front of students on a daily basis
in<00:04:38.840> the<00:04:38.900> same<00:04:39.139> way<00:04:39.320> that<00:04:39.440> we<00:04:39.500> don't<00:04:39.680> just

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
in the same way that we don't just

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.860 
in the same way that we don't just
celebrate<00:04:40.310> writing<00:04:40.910> or<00:04:41.060> reading<00:04:41.240> one<00:04:41.660> or<00:04:41.780> two

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
celebrate writing or reading one or two

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.570 
celebrate writing or reading one or two
days<00:04:42.050> a<00:04:42.080> year<00:04:42.230> they're<00:04:42.889> incorporated<00:04:43.460> into

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
days a year they're incorporated into

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.790 
days a year they're incorporated into
all<00:04:43.790> our<00:04:43.820> classes<00:04:44.120> not<00:04:44.510> just<00:04:44.780> English<00:04:44.990> the

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
all our classes not just English the

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.379 
all our classes not just English the
same<00:04:46.040> way<00:04:46.190> environmental<00:04:46.850> issues<00:04:47.090> should<00:04:47.330> be

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
same way environmental issues should be

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:56.469 
same way environmental issues should be
as<00:04:47.690> well<00:04:47.720> I<00:04:54.970> believe<00:04:55.970> that<00:04:56.000> the<00:04:56.240> environment

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
as well I believe that the environment

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:02.110 
as well I believe that the environment
is<00:04:56.840> is<00:04:57.110> a<00:04:59.139> discipline<00:05:00.139> that<00:05:00.229> can<00:05:00.530> be<00:05:00.880> used<00:05:01.880> to

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
is is a discipline that can be used to

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.600 
is is a discipline that can be used to
integrate<00:05:02.660> all<00:05:02.900> other<00:05:03.169> disciplines<00:05:03.710> so<00:05:04.400> we

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
integrate all other disciplines so we

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.379 
integrate all other disciplines so we
can<00:05:04.820> get<00:05:05.000> math<00:05:05.840> and<00:05:06.290> science<00:05:06.889> and<00:05:07.389> humanities

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
can get math and science and humanities

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:11.950 
can get math and science and humanities
and<00:05:08.720> Social<00:05:09.139> Sciences<00:05:09.169> into<00:05:10.840> into<00:05:11.840> an
