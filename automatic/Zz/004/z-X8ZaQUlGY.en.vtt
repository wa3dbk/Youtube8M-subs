00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
so it's right there and I did not figure

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.209 
so it's right there and I did not figure
that<00:00:29.519> out<00:00:30.260> initially<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.470> this<00:00:31.619> took<00:00:31.920> me<00:00:32.099> like

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
that out initially and this took me like

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.340

20<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.790> 30<00:00:33.000> minutes<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.329> figure<00:00:33.660> out<00:00:33.840> because<00:00:34.050> I

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
20 to 30 minutes to figure out because I

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.959 
20 to 30 minutes to figure out because I
just<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.680> didn't<00:00:35.010> know<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.219> could<00:00:35.489> stop<00:00:35.760> it
