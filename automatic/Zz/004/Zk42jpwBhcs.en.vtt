a pressed glass a molded glass and

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.030 
a pressed glass a molded glass and
almost<00:01:00.600> always<00:01:00.900> it's<00:01:01.470> really<00:01:01.830> thoughtful

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
almost always it's really thoughtful

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.930 
almost always it's really thoughtful
essent<00:01:02.699> or<00:01:03.479> iridescent<00:01:04.129> which<00:01:05.129> means<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.820> if

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
essent or iridescent which means that if

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.590 
essent or iridescent which means that if
you<00:01:05.970> look<00:01:06.270> at<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:07.369> it<00:01:08.369> has<00:01:08.430> different<00:01:09.090> colors

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
you look at it it has different colors

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.740 
you look at it it has different colors
depending<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:10.260> which<00:01:10.469> way<00:01:10.939> your<00:01:11.969> the<00:01:12.329> light<00:01:12.509> is

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
depending on which way your the light is

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.260 
depending on which way your the light is
and<00:01:13.109> so<00:01:13.530> that's<00:01:14.430> one<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.759> the<00:01:14.820> interesting

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
and so that's one of the interesting

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.069 
and so that's one of the interesting
things<00:01:15.570> about<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.109> it's<00:01:16.409> not<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:17.299> a<00:01:18.299> solid

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079 
things about it is it's not just a solid

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.560 
things about it is it's not just a solid
color<00:01:19.109> some<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.280> them<00:01:20.430> are<00:01:20.670> more<00:01:21.000> subtle<00:01:21.479> than

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
color some of them are more subtle than

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.300 
color some of them are more subtle than
others<00:01:22.100> this<00:01:23.240> for<00:01:24.240> instance<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:25.280> actually<00:01:26.280> a

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
others this for instance is actually a

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.630 
others this for instance is actually a
little<00:01:26.549> shinier<00:01:27.179> in<00:01:27.509> one<00:01:28.259> respect<00:01:28.740> but<00:01:28.859> not<00:01:29.009> as

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
little shinier in one respect but not as

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.719 
little shinier in one respect but not as
shiny<00:01:29.909> another<00:01:30.359> so<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:31.679> can<00:01:32.189> see<00:01:32.399> that<00:01:32.579> it

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
shiny another so you can see that it

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.459 
shiny another so you can see that it
does<00:01:32.909> vary<00:01:33.359> considerably<00:01:35.659> this<00:01:36.659> would<00:01:36.869> be<00:01:37.079> an

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:37.469 
does vary considerably this would be an

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:39.590 
does vary considerably this would be an
exception<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.460> one's<00:01:38.700> just<00:01:38.820> like<00:01:38.969> very

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
exception this one's just like very

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.819 
exception this one's just like very
shiny<00:01:40.249> it<00:01:41.249> has<00:01:41.429> a<00:01:41.460> pattern<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:41.999> the<00:01:42.149> back<00:01:42.829> so

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
shiny it has a pattern on the back so

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.529 
shiny it has a pattern on the back so
when<00:01:44.039> you<00:01:44.159> look<00:01:44.369> through<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.850> see<00:01:45.390> a

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
when you look through it you see a

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.429 
when you look through it you see a
pattern<00:01:45.840> even<00:01:46.380> though<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:46.829> it's<00:01:47.399> very<00:01:47.549> shiny

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
pattern even though it's it's very shiny

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.489 
pattern even though it's it's very shiny
on<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.619> outside<00:01:50.100> I'm<00:01:50.579> gonna<00:01:50.700> get<00:01:50.969> that<00:01:51.149> color

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:51.499 
on the outside I'm gonna get that color

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:55.520 
on the outside I'm gonna get that color
but<00:01:52.499> uh<00:01:52.789> this<00:01:53.789> is<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.600> little<00:01:55.140> different

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
but uh this is a little different

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.899 
but uh this is a little different
concept<00:01:56.479> this<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.780> also<00:01:58.759> opalescent<00:01:59.759> or

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
concept this is also opalescent or

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.459 
concept this is also opalescent or
iridescent<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.549> and<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:03.060> has<00:02:03.270> but<00:02:04.079> it's<00:02:04.200> just

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
iridescent and and it has but it's just

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.050 
iridescent and and it has but it's just
kind<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.889> a<00:02:05.600> look<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.130> this<00:02:08.130> is<00:02:08.399> again<00:02:08.759> the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
kind of a look to it this is again the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.120 
kind of a look to it this is again the
same<00:02:09.330> kind<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.840> situation<00:02:10.350> this<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:10.979> what

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
same kind of situation this is what

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.470
