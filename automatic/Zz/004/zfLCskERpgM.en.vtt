00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
be but one of the good things about this

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.959 
be but one of the good things about this
fine<00:00:36.840> art<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.500> does<00:00:37.739> heat<00:00:38.190> up<00:00:38.340> really<00:00:38.640> fast

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
fine art is it does heat up really fast

know<00:00:57.680> exactly<00:00:58.680> what<00:00:59.070> the<00:01:00.620> guess<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.770> good

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
know exactly what the guess the good

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.910 
know exactly what the guess the good
points<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.730> but<00:01:03.379> yeah<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.559> reviews
