00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
it'll be perfect let's say you'd like to

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.310 
it'll be perfect let's say you'd like to
do<00:00:47.340> just<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.670> little<00:00:48.120> bit<00:00:48.270> more<00:00:48.480> analysis<00:00:49.170> than

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
do just a little bit more analysis than

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.840 
do just a little bit more analysis than
that<00:00:49.500> then<00:00:49.800> there's<00:00:49.980> six<00:00:50.250> things<00:00:50.520> for<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.820> to

that then there's six things for you to

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.000 
that then there's six things for you to
think<00:00:50.969> about<00:00:51.270> let's<00:00:52.140> go<00:00:52.379> through<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.649> one<00:00:52.860> by

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
think about let's go through a one by

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.590 
think about let's go through a one by
one<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.340> then<00:00:53.460> we'll<00:00:53.489> do<00:00:53.730> them<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:53.940> detail<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
one and then we'll do them in detail the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.619 
one and then we'll do them in detail the
first<00:00:55.199> one<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.890> processor<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:57.149> second

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
first one is the processor the second

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.110 
first one is the processor the second
one<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> amount<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.649> RAM<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.609> third<00:00:59.879> one

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
one is the amount of RAM the third one

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.450 
one is the amount of RAM the third one
is<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.270> size<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.050> screen<00:01:01.309> then<00:01:02.309> you've

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
is the size of the screen then you've

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.090 
is the size of the screen then you've
got<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.940> size<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.539> hard<00:01:03.690> disk<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.769> type

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
got the size of the hard disk the type

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.460 
got the size of the hard disk the type
of<00:01:05.129> optical<00:01:05.850> drive<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.420> whether<00:01:07.140> or<00:01:07.229> not<00:01:07.380> it

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
of optical drive and whether or not it

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.530 
of optical drive and whether or not it
has<00:01:07.740> wireless<00:01:08.040> networking<00:01:08.729> if<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.330> think

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
has wireless networking if you think

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.120 
has wireless networking if you think
about<00:01:09.600> all<00:01:09.780> six<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.380> those<00:01:10.500> things<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.040> get

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
about all six of those things and get
