00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.980 
at Barcelona when doing junior years you
never<00:01:36.930> had<00:01:37.170> great<00:01:37.439> strike<00:01:37.799> force<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.990> also

apple<00:01:40.140> clubs<00:01:40.409> as<00:01:40.590> well<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:41.040> I'll<00:01:41.490> say<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:41.790> one

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
apple clubs as well so I'll say it's one

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.280 
apple clubs as well so I'll say it's one
of<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.060> best<00:01:42.210> strike<00:01:42.479> force<00:01:42.750> out<00:01:42.899> there<00:01:43.079> but

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
of the best strike force out there but

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.859 
of the best strike force out there but
not<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.740> best<00:01:44.090> so<00:01:45.090> now<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.390> top<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.570> deals

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
first of all Manchester City have

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.889 
first of all Manchester City have

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
is Jack wood will from Everton 15

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.030 
is Jack wood will from Everton 15
million<00:01:54.060> pounds<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.619> think<00:01:55.950> you'll

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
million pounds and that I think you'll

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.530 
million pounds and that I think you'll
hardly<00:01:56.280> get<00:01:56.490> played<00:01:56.729> guys<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.180> think<00:01:57.360> you'd<00:01:57.450> be

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
hardly get played guys I think you'd be

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.120 
hardly get played guys I think you'd be
like<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.020> Adam<00:01:58.170> Johnson<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.890> just<00:01:59.070> be

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
like just that Adam Johnson you just be

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.370 
like just that Adam Johnson you just be
a<00:01:59.159> bench<00:01:59.369> warmer<00:01:59.520> again<00:02:00.140> so<00:02:01.140> it's<00:02:01.320> just

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
a bench warmer again so it's just

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.899 
a bench warmer again so it's just
another<00:02:01.770> thing<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.189> good<00:02:02.369> milk<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.700> don't

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
another thing is a good milk I don't

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:03.980 
another thing is a good milk I don't
think<00:02:02.969> it's<00:02:03.180> good<00:02:03.329> move<00:02:03.479> at<00:02:03.630> all<00:02:03.750> in<00:02:03.869> my

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
think it's good move at all in my

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.899 
think it's good move at all in my
opinion<00:02:04.259> if<00:02:04.979> they're<00:02:05.219> playing<00:02:05.460> me<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.670> sure

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
opinion if they're playing me a sure

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.210 
opinion if they're playing me a sure
thing<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.299> good<00:02:06.450> move<00:02:06.630> but<00:02:06.899> for<00:02:07.590> 15<00:02:07.920> million

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
thing is a good move but for 15 million

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.589 
thing is a good move but for 15 million
pounds<00:02:08.459> you're<00:02:08.580> signing<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.970> players<00:02:09.209> going

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
pounds you're signing of players going

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.699 
pounds you're signing of players going
to<00:02:09.720> sit<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.020> bench<00:02:10.200> for<00:02:10.289> most<00:02:10.560> of<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
to sit in the bench for most of the

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.400 
to sit in the bench for most of the
season<00:02:10.890> it's<00:02:11.760> just<00:02:11.970> like<00:02:12.030> Lukaku<00:02:12.629> you<00:02:12.720> though

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
season it's just like Lukaku you though

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.990 
season it's just like Lukaku you though
he<00:02:13.500> hardly<00:02:13.710> played<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.190> Chelsea<00:02:14.580> only<00:02:14.820> two

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
he hardly played the Chelsea only two

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.510 
he hardly played the Chelsea only two
games<00:02:15.210> he<00:02:15.450> played<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.660> Chelsea<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.400> you<00:02:17.400> know

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.430 
games he played the Chelsea and you know
I<00:02:17.550> think<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.180> should<00:02:18.330> let<00:02:18.570> him<00:02:18.630> go<00:02:18.840> like<00:02:19.050> the

I think you should let him go like the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.590 
I think you should let him go like the

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
Archie from Arsenal he straightened

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.690 
Archie from Arsenal he straightened
Wigan<00:02:28.350> online<00:02:28.710> and<00:02:29.100> I<00:02:29.160> think<00:02:29.340> this<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.520> a<00:02:29.550> great

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
Wigan online and I think this is a great

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.550 
Wigan online and I think this is a great
deal<00:02:29.970> for<00:02:30.180> Wigan<00:02:30.480> I<00:02:30.720> think<00:02:31.320> it'd<00:02:31.440> be<00:02:31.470> really

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
deal for Wigan I think it'd be really

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.410 
deal for Wigan I think it'd be really
good<00:02:31.980> for<00:02:32.070> them<00:02:32.220> because<00:02:32.400> also<00:02:32.760> never<00:02:33.090> really

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
good for them because also never really

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.850 
good for them because also never really
gave<00:02:33.540> him<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.780> chance<00:02:33.990> again<00:02:34.380> another<00:02:34.560> player

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
gave him a chance again another player

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.280 
gave him a chance again another player
like<00:02:35.040> Lukaku<00:02:35.750> never<00:02:36.750> really<00:02:37.050> got<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.230> chance

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
like Lukaku never really got a chance

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.890 
like Lukaku never really got a chance
and<00:02:38.000> with<00:02:39.000> Regan<00:02:39.270> he<00:02:39.360> would<00:02:39.480> definitely<00:02:39.750> get<00:02:39.870> a

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
and with Regan he would definitely get a

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.450 
and with Regan he would definitely get a
chance<00:02:40.140> I<00:02:40.320> think<00:02:40.350> he'll<00:02:40.590> score<00:02:40.800> few<00:02:41.040> goals<00:02:41.280> for

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
chance I think he'll score few goals for

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.300 
chance I think he'll score few goals for
them<00:02:41.630> next<00:02:42.630> year<00:02:42.810> his<00:02:43.050> Gaston<00:02:43.470> Ramirez<00:02:43.800> and

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
them next year his Gaston Ramirez and

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.610 
them next year his Gaston Ramirez and
he's<00:02:44.940> actually<00:02:45.090> rejected<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:45.840> move<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:46.350> Spurs

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
he's actually rejected a move to Spurs

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.980 
he's actually rejected a move to Spurs
and<00:02:47.040> Liverpool<00:02:47.460> to<00:02:47.670> join<00:02:47.850> Southampton<00:02:48.600> for

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
and Liverpool to join Southampton for

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.530 
and Liverpool to join Southampton for
11.8<00:02:49.650> million<00:02:49.920> so<00:02:50.850> this<00:02:50.940> has<00:02:51.090> been<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.270> shock

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
11.8 million so this has been a shock

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.120 
11.8 million so this has been a shock
move<00:02:51.810> for<00:02:51.990> everyone<00:02:52.380> because<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.680> don't<00:02:53.100> know

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
move for everyone because I don't know

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.890
