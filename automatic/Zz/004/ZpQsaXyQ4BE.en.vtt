fighting game basically a full-on

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.049 
fighting game basically a full-on
fighting<00:00:30.630> game<00:00:30.840> that's<00:00:31.769> all<00:00:31.920> about<00:00:32.059> Taekwondo

fighting game that's all about Taekwondo
and<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:34.460> think<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.640> it's<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:36.380> think<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.559> it's

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
and I think that it's I think that it's

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.569 
and I think that it's I think that it's
pretty<00:00:38.070> darn<00:00:38.910> brilliant<00:00:39.570> actually<00:00:40.219> so<00:00:41.219> I

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
pretty darn brilliant actually so I

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.490 
pretty darn brilliant actually so I
don't<00:00:41.820> really<00:00:42.030> like<00:00:42.239> fighting<00:00:42.930> games<00:00:42.960> very

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
don't really like fighting games very

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.860 
don't really like fighting games very
much<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.969> iPhone<00:00:44.969> or<00:00:45.149> iPad<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.600> sort<00:00:45.840> of

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
much on iPhone or iPad that sort of

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.229 
much on iPhone or iPad that sort of
thing<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.320> tend<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.920> find<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.340> touchscreen

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
thing I tend to find that touchscreen

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.060 
thing I tend to find that touchscreen
controls<00:00:48.780> don't<00:00:48.989> really<00:00:49.170> work<00:00:49.379> when<00:00:49.860> you're

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
controls don't really work when you're

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.190 
controls don't really work when you're
when<00:00:50.700> you've<00:00:50.820> got<00:00:50.969> like<00:00:51.120> King<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.899> Fighters<00:00:51.989> or

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
when you've got like King of Fighters or

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.450 
when you've got like King of Fighters or
Street<00:00:52.469> Fighter<00:00:52.649> or<00:00:52.920> something<00:00:53.309> like<00:00:53.399> that

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
Street Fighter or something like that

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.520 
Street Fighter or something like that
where<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.390> all<00:00:54.539> about<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:55.079> know<00:00:55.170> quarter

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
where it's all about you know quarter

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.680 
where it's all about you know quarter
turns<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.399> stuff<00:00:56.700> like<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:58.969> I<00:00:59.969> just

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
turns and and stuff like that and I just

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.360 
turns and and stuff like that and I just
don't<00:01:00.780> think<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.199> really<00:01:01.289> works<00:01:01.500> but<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
don't think that really works but the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.359 
don't think that really works but the
you<00:01:03.059> know<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.660> has<00:01:03.809> been<00:01:04.009> simplified<00:01:05.009> down

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
you know this has been simplified down

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.690 
you know this has been simplified down
to<00:01:05.670> left<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.119> right<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.740> then<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.799> few<00:01:08.249> sort<00:01:08.609> of

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
to left and right and then a few sort of

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.609 
to left and right and then a few sort of
inputs<00:01:09.450> on<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.689> bottom<00:01:09.990> right<00:01:10.139> so<00:01:10.289> you<00:01:10.350> can

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
inputs on the bottom right so you can

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.209

see<00:01:10.770> with<00:01:10.889> my<00:01:10.920> arrows<00:01:11.369> there<00:01:11.639> look<00:01:12.740> at<00:01:13.740> the

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:14.219 
see with my arrows there look at the

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:16.399 
see with my arrows there look at the
bottom<00:01:14.490> left<00:01:14.819> that's<00:01:15.149> my<00:01:15.389> left<00:01:15.719> and<00:01:15.869> right<00:01:15.929> and

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.489 
you will do a lot of positioning that's
a<00:01:18.420> big<00:01:18.630> thing<00:01:18.899> in<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.139> Taekwondo<00:01:19.380> game<00:01:21.499> above

you can see my my stamina bar is just

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:38.839

kind<00:01:36.719> of<00:01:36.749> falling<00:01:37.229> down<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:38.310> game<00:01:38.459> is<00:01:38.639> based

00:01:38.839 --> 00:01:38.849 
kind of falling down the game is based

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:40.909 
kind of falling down the game is based
on<00:01:38.969> points<00:01:39.479> from<00:01:39.599> the<00:01:39.899> knockout<00:01:40.439> from<00:01:40.740> what

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:40.919 
on points from the knockout from what

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:43.729 
on points from the knockout from what
I've<00:01:41.039> seen<00:01:41.459> so<00:01:41.759> far<00:01:41.989> so<00:01:42.989> you'll<00:01:43.109> see<00:01:43.289> that<00:01:43.439> you

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:43.739 
I've seen so far so you'll see that you

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:46.819 
I've seen so far so you'll see that you
know<00:01:43.829> number<00:01:44.189> two<00:01:44.310> came<00:01:44.549> up<00:01:44.729> there<00:01:44.969> and<00:01:45.829> number

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
know number two came up there and number

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.849 
know number two came up there and number
four<00:01:47.159> if<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.729> get<00:01:47.939> hits<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.109> head<00:01:49.319> and

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:49.859 
four if you get hits in the head and

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:51.830 
four if you get hits in the head and
they're<00:01:50.579> worth<00:01:50.729> more<00:01:50.939> hits<00:01:51.419> to<00:01:51.569> the<00:01:51.659> body

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
they're worth more hits to the body

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.129 
they're worth more hits to the body
essentially<00:01:53.149> so<00:01:54.149> yeah<00:01:54.509> neutral<00:01:54.869> block<00:01:55.020> and

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:55.139 
essentially so yeah neutral block and

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:57.199 
essentially so yeah neutral block and
we'll<00:01:55.229> do<00:01:55.319> that<00:01:55.469> but<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.679> can<00:01:55.799> also<00:01:56.209> block

00:01:57.199 --> 00:01:57.209 
we'll do that but you can also block

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:00.440

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.270 
when you're doing your neutral block and
that<00:02:05.130> gives<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:06.299> know<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.419> bit<00:02:06.659> more

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
that gives you you know a bit more

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.060 
that gives you you know a bit more
kind<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.880> moment<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.570> react<00:02:10.070> essentially

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
kind of a moment to react essentially

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.600 
kind of a moment to react essentially
I'm<00:02:12.000> naked<00:02:12.300> there<00:02:12.720> so<00:02:13.560> I<00:02:13.590> ran<00:02:14.130> out<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:14.280> stamina

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
I'm naked there so I ran out of stamina

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.340 
I'm naked there so I ran out of stamina
and<00:02:14.760> therefore<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.180> got<00:02:15.390> absolutely<00:02:15.570> I<00:02:16.080> was

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
and therefore I got absolutely I was

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.340 
and therefore I got absolutely I was
like<00:02:16.500> oh<00:02:16.650> I'm<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.070> tired<00:02:17.300> and<00:02:18.300> that<00:02:19.080> means<00:02:19.260> that

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
like oh I'm so tired and that means that

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.780 
like oh I'm so tired and that means that
you<00:02:19.440> can't<00:02:19.650> attack<00:02:19.860> or<00:02:20.130> block<00:02:20.160> so<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.610> don't

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
you can't attack or block so you don't

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.130 
you can't attack or block so you don't
want<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.000> get<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.240> that<00:02:21.330> situation<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.080> you

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
want to get to that situation so you

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.920 
want to get to that situation so you
want<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.350> use<00:02:22.500> your<00:02:23.000> positioning<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.180> lot<00:02:24.660> more

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
want to use your positioning a lot more

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.330 
want to use your positioning a lot more
you<00:02:25.140> see<00:02:25.290> I<00:02:25.320> just<00:02:25.380> mentioned<00:02:25.920> dodge<00:02:26.070> out<00:02:26.250> the

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
you see I just mentioned dodge out the

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.530 
you see I just mentioned dodge out the
way<00:02:26.400> of<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.580> kick<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:27.060> only<00:02:27.360> use<00:02:27.450> your

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
way of that kick and only use your

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.140 
way of that kick and only use your
positioning<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:29.010> you<00:02:29.280> want<00:02:29.459> to<00:02:29.550> use<00:02:29.760> your

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
positioning and you want to use your

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.480 
positioning and you want to use your
block<00:02:30.600> kind<00:02:31.020> of<00:02:31.080> sparingly<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:31.890> then<00:02:32.100> when

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
block kind of sparingly and then when

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.880 
block kind of sparingly and then when
you<00:02:32.610> know<00:02:32.760> that<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.060> can<00:02:33.240> like<00:02:34.080> get<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.470> kick<00:02:34.740> or

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
you know that you can like get a kick or

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.790 
you know that you can like get a kick or
a<00:02:34.920> punch<00:02:35.520> or<00:02:35.700> whatever<00:02:35.940> in<00:02:36.290> then<00:02:37.290> that's<00:02:37.650> the

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
a punch or whatever in then that's the

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.320 
a punch or whatever in then that's the
point<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.160> think<00:02:38.340> yeah<00:02:38.580> do<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:41.180> it's<00:02:42.180> all

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
point you think yeah do that it's all

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.660 
point you think yeah do that it's all
about<00:02:42.480> kind<00:02:42.750> of<00:02:42.980> seeing<00:02:43.980> if<00:02:44.130> you<00:02:44.220> can<00:02:44.340> find<00:02:44.550> an

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
about kind of seeing if you can find an

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.580 
about kind of seeing if you can find an
opening<00:02:45.530> and<00:02:47.239> and<00:02:48.239> and<00:02:48.630> sort<00:02:48.810> of<00:02:48.930> capitalizing

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
opening and and and sort of capitalizing

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.140 
opening and and and sort of capitalizing
on<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:49.950> basically<00:02:50.660> you<00:02:51.660> can<00:02:51.780> play<00:02:51.870> defensively

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
on it basically you can play defensively

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.360 
on it basically you can play defensively
you<00:02:54.150> can<00:02:54.360> play<00:02:54.570> sort<00:02:55.290> of<00:02:55.380> very<00:02:55.860> aggressively

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
you can play sort of very aggressively

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.790 
you can play sort of very aggressively
and<00:02:56.670> you<00:02:57.480> can<00:02:57.660> you<00:02:57.870> can<00:02:57.989> play<00:02:58.080> kind<00:02:58.320> of<00:02:58.410> mix<00:02:58.620> of

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
and you can you can play kind of mix of

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.530 
and you can you can play kind of mix of
both<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.130> those<00:02:59.280> things<00:02:59.489> but<00:02:59.700> one<00:03:00.360> of<00:03:00.450> the

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
both of those things but one of the

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.360 
both of those things but one of the
techniques<00:03:01.110> that<00:03:01.170> I've<00:03:01.320> found<00:03:01.830> definitely

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
techniques that I've found definitely

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.910 
techniques that I've found definitely
works<00:03:02.610> is<00:03:02.970> is<00:03:03.750> kind<00:03:04.110> of<00:03:04.170> keeping<00:03:04.770> your

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
works is is kind of keeping your

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.650 
works is is kind of keeping your
distance<00:03:05.030> giving<00:03:06.030> them<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.209> bit<00:03:06.360> of<00:03:06.450> space

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
distance giving them a bit of space

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.060 
distance giving them a bit of space
letting<00:03:07.050> them<00:03:07.140> wear<00:03:07.290> themselves<00:03:07.440> out

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
letting them wear themselves out

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.770 
letting them wear themselves out
you<00:03:08.400> know<00:03:08.520> blocking<00:03:08.970> when<00:03:09.090> needs<00:03:09.330> be<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.660> then

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
you know blocking when needs be and then

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.680 
you know blocking when needs be and then
a<00:03:09.900> big<00:03:10.230> flying<00:03:10.650> kick<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.520> head<00:03:11.690> brilliant

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
a big flying kick to the head brilliant

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.949 
a big flying kick to the head brilliant
like<00:03:13.500> that<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.910> also<00:03:15.150> when<00:03:15.510> you're<00:03:15.660> in<00:03:15.870> the

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
like that and also when you're in the

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.440 
like that and also when you're in the
middle<00:03:16.170> of<00:03:16.260> a<00:03:16.470> fight<00:03:16.709> you<00:03:16.890> can<00:03:17.070> press<00:03:17.310> away<00:03:18.060> and

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
middle of a fight you can press away and

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.930 
middle of a fight you can press away and
the<00:03:18.840> down<00:03:19.140> arrow<00:03:19.470> and<00:03:19.920> that'll<00:03:20.400> spin<00:03:20.700> round

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
the down arrow and that'll spin round

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.310 
the down arrow and that'll spin round
I'll<00:03:21.090> give<00:03:21.239> you<00:03:21.299> a<00:03:21.330> point<00:03:21.540> but<00:03:21.720> it'll<00:03:21.870> also<00:03:21.959> get

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
I'll give you a point but it'll also get

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.780 
I'll give you a point but it'll also get
you<00:03:22.470> out<00:03:22.590> of<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.830> way<00:03:22.980> of<00:03:23.010> things<00:03:23.340> so<00:03:23.700> you

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
you out of the way of things so you

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:24.860 
you out of the way of things so you
might<00:03:23.910> also<00:03:23.940> see<00:03:24.269> that<00:03:24.360> there's<00:03:24.510> a<00:03:24.570> symbol

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
might also see that there's a symbol

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.830 
might also see that there's a symbol
with<00:03:24.959> an<00:03:25.049> S<00:03:25.290> if<00:03:25.739> I<00:03:26.220> hold<00:03:26.459> that<00:03:26.580> it's<00:03:27.540> like<00:03:27.810> a

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
with an S if I hold that it's like a

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.009 
with an S if I hold that it's like a
counter-attack<00:03:28.680> essentially<00:03:29.670> and<00:03:29.850> it<00:03:30.810> kind

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
counter-attack essentially and it kind

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.610 
counter-attack essentially and it kind
of<00:03:31.080> goes<00:03:31.350> through<00:03:32.060> most<00:03:33.060> attacks<00:03:33.570> it's<00:03:34.410> pretty

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
of goes through most attacks it's pretty

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.440 
of goes through most attacks it's pretty
useful<00:03:34.799> but<00:03:35.190> you've<00:03:35.430> got<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:35.880> be<00:03:35.940> really

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
useful but you've got to be really

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.860 
useful but you've got to be really
skilled<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.680> use<00:03:37.950> it<00:03:39.560> or<00:03:40.560> lucky<00:03:40.920> I<00:03:41.070> suppose<00:03:41.870> and

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
skilled to use it or lucky I suppose and

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.560 
skilled to use it or lucky I suppose and
then<00:03:43.019> at<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.230> end<00:03:43.350> of<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.500> round<00:03:43.970> you<00:03:44.970> what<00:03:45.510> at

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
then at the end of the round you what at

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.360 
then at the end of the round you what at
the<00:03:45.660> end<00:03:45.750> of<00:03:45.840> three<00:03:46.320> rounds<00:03:46.380> you<00:03:46.950> see<00:03:47.100> how<00:03:47.220> many

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
the end of three rounds you see how many

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.030 
the end of three rounds you see how many
points<00:03:47.640> you've<00:03:47.760> got<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.120> then<00:03:48.690> you<00:03:48.720> win<00:03:49.040> like

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
points you've got and then you win like

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.590 
points you've got and then you win like
I've<00:03:50.250> just<00:03:50.280> done<00:03:50.670> there<00:03:50.850> and<00:03:51.000> then<00:03:51.299> bottom

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
I've just done there and then bottom

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.770 
I've just done there and then bottom
left<00:03:51.810> you'll<00:03:51.959> see<00:03:52.019> a<00:03:52.519> different<00:03:53.519> little

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
left you'll see a different little

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.090
