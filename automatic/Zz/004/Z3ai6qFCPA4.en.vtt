00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
we would have just taught him if he just

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.070 
we would have just taught him if he just
wanted<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.610> go<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:09.030> music<00:01:09.360> all<00:01:09.750> he<00:01:09.869> wants<00:01:10.049> to

wanted to go on in music all he wants to

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.960 
wanted to go on in music all he wants to

do is buy booze with his son that's fine

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.070 
do is buy booze with his son that's fine
so<00:01:12.570> what<00:01:13.470> they're<00:01:14.010> teaching<00:01:14.720> really<00:01:15.720> depends

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
so what they're teaching really depends

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.330 
so what they're teaching really depends
on<00:01:16.170> what<00:01:16.229> people<00:01:16.619> want<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.799> learn<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.130> try
