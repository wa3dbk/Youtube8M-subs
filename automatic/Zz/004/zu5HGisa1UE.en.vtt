 they say that it is impossible to advance in Monaco but Fernando Alonso 

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:15.629
 they get the streets of the principality at the exit it went through the inside it went so 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:18.150
 only pipes of law 4 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.289
 I was so bad 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.989
 affects more to the fourth stage 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:22.679
 apart it does not arrive 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.689
 the cause of poverty we probably project forward 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.519
 has been the last great outing of Fernando Alonso in this World Cup he went 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.010
 stuck to the wall rising march was endured beyond the entrance of the 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.359
 curve was already third 

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:38.310
 to kill mulberry balaclava biomass 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.930
 we look at the marraqueta fair of the neighborhood that does not turn out well 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.930
 since the start has been again from the book 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.990
 a number 6 we stayed in a place very dear to alonso returned one day 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.470
 he could not repeat victory that left him with his mouth open to many with a 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.470
 spectacular output was found 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.090
 grill no no no 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.090
 in malaysia we had to have our view in the last places alonso 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.190
 He came out from the last row but he did it all the same way back up 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.330
 five posts even the luxury of alcantara mark webber was allowed 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.330
 He came out from the front of the grid 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.170
 the back row 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.170
 fernando alonso are added 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.800
 with the track soaked with a dry beater was issued between his marriage and he 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.250
 imposed on the slipstream from the port climbers to the second 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.010
 step 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.010
 But it is reality 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.560
 we got to the podium of the best in australia we saw the first advance of what 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.820
 that yes it can be the exit of Fernando Alonso in this world he told them that a 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.820
 formula one does not have traction for the grass 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.550
 the second step of the podium we have reserved it germany alonso came back 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.620
 two positions on the finish straight line of mowed joaquin placed behind 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.860
 raikkonen until he could give him the chance he turned left to make a 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.510
 sprint on the outside and reach the first corner in the second position 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.559
 for alarm 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:17.559
 I hope it is clear 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:22.059
 we go to the first one also preferred by the viewers without a doubt the best 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:25.459
 that we have seen in a world cup was raffling everyone on the left and 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.369
 after the incredible right started from ninth place and 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:30.189
 end of the line of the ibi oval 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:33.189
 I was so close 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.719
 we will still have to act to record even though blackout will be 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:41.579
 he risked a lot and is in a hurry incredible will lose because 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.579
 compared magistrate 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.340
 well then we continue our walk hour by a footbridge that crosses right by 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.350
 above the track 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.780
 the output of Fernando Alonso and notice this is the fair output of the pil in here 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.370
 in brazil and the first one a little above the dinner curve here is going to play 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.620
 tomorrow a lot of important things besides the croatian strategies 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.350
 also very important in the day tomorrow but if that season had 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.050
 something important has been without place without doubt the tire war and 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.780
 I think that an area is usually banned for almost all chains of 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.900
 television this one
