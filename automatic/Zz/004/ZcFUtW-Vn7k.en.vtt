00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880

the<00:02:04.780> fabrics<00:02:05.259> a<00:02:05.380> little<00:02:05.619> thicker<00:02:07.170> but<00:02:08.170> will

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
the fabrics a little thicker but will

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:22.970 
the fabrics a little thicker but will
debit<00:02:08.709> eventually
