00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
everything just became lighter I didn't

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.720 
everything just became lighter I didn't
have<00:03:27.140> to<00:03:27.290> think<00:03:27.500> about<00:03:27.620> all<00:03:28.040> these<00:03:28.340> extra

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
have to think about all these extra

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.460 
have to think about all these extra
animals<00:03:29.239> and<00:03:29.390> I<00:03:29.420> needed<00:03:29.630> on<00:03:29.840> my<00:03:29.930> property<00:03:30.170> to

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
animals and I needed on my property to

animals and I needed on my property to
survive<00:03:30.890> I<00:03:31.190> could<00:03:31.700> be<00:03:31.850> done<00:03:32.060> with<00:03:32.269> just<00:03:32.420> fruits

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
animals that i could look after and

prepare myself kill and prepare so that

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.960 
prepare myself kill and prepare so that
was<00:03:44.930> a<00:03:45.140> seed<00:03:45.530> that<00:03:45.560> grew<00:03:46.070> and<00:03:46.370> as<00:03:46.640> I<00:03:46.760> looked

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
was a seed that grew and as I looked

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.569 
was a seed that grew and as I looked
into<00:03:47.150> it<00:03:47.269> further<00:03:47.600> I<00:03:48.019> realized<00:03:48.890> that<00:03:49.040> I<00:03:49.250> didn't

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
into it further I realized that I didn't

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.460 
into it further I realized that I didn't
need<00:03:49.670> to<00:03:49.850> be<00:03:49.940> eating<00:03:50.239> animals<00:03:50.630> at<00:03:50.810> all<00:03:51.049> then

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
need to be eating animals at all then

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.630 
need to be eating animals at all then
when<00:03:51.560> I<00:03:51.590> looked<00:03:51.769> into<00:03:51.860> the<00:03:52.010> health<00:03:52.190> side<00:03:52.400> from

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
when I looked into the health side from

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.240 
when I looked into the health side from
a<00:03:52.730> scientific<00:03:53.150> perspective<00:03:53.570> it<00:03:54.290> was<00:03:54.560> just

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
a scientific perspective it was just

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.759 
a scientific perspective it was just
black<00:03:55.730> and<00:03:55.760> white<00:03:56.000> there<00:03:56.360> was<00:03:56.480> eating<00:03:57.380> animals

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
black and white there was eating animals

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.819 
black and white there was eating animals
was<00:03:58.370> making<00:03:59.269> your<00:03:59.390> health<00:03:59.630> bad<00:03:59.900> that<00:04:00.530> was<00:04:00.709> the

was making your health bad that was the

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:02.020 
was making your health bad that was the
huge<00:04:01.040> light<00:04:01.280> bulb<00:04:01.489> moment<00:04:01.549> where<00:04:02.000> everything

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
huge light bulb moment where everything

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.690 
huge light bulb moment where everything
connected<00:04:02.959> that<00:04:03.470> I<00:04:03.500> could<00:04:03.680> be<00:04:03.829> done<00:04:04.070> with<00:04:04.310> the

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
connected that I could be done with the

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.220 
connected that I could be done with the
animals<00:04:05.060> they<00:04:05.209> can<00:04:05.390> live<00:04:05.540> their<00:04:05.570> own<00:04:05.720> life<00:04:05.959> I

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
animals they can live their own life I

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.479 
animals they can live their own life I
don't<00:04:06.620> need<00:04:06.680> to<00:04:06.739> worry<00:04:06.920> about<00:04:07.010> putting<00:04:07.280> them

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
don't need to worry about putting them

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.789 
don't need to worry about putting them
onto<00:04:07.610> my<00:04:07.880> property<00:04:08.360> I<00:04:08.840> could<00:04:09.260> have<00:04:09.440> all<00:04:09.590> my

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
onto my property I could have all my

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.710 
onto my property I could have all my
fruits<00:04:10.040> and<00:04:10.190> vegetables<00:04:10.519> and<00:04:10.640> live<00:04:10.880> even<00:04:11.570> in

fruits and vegetables and live even in

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.000 
fruits and vegetables and live even in
more<00:04:11.930> health<00:04:12.260> than<00:04:12.470> what<00:04:12.709> i<00:04:12.739> would<00:04:12.980> have

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
more health than what i would have

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.090 
more health than what i would have
having<00:04:13.670> to<00:04:13.760> care<00:04:14.030> for<00:04:14.510> a<00:04:14.720> ton<00:04:15.140> of<00:04:15.170> animals<00:04:15.620> so

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
having to care for a ton of animals so

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.440 
having to care for a ton of animals so
that's<00:04:16.430> sort<00:04:16.669> of<00:04:16.760> where<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.030> vegan<00:04:17.299> is<00:04:17.419> a

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
that's sort of where the vegan is a

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.449 
that's sort of where the vegan is a
message<00:04:17.840> grew<00:04:18.079> from<00:04:18.410> and<00:04:18.620> since<00:04:18.919> then<00:04:19.160> it's

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
message grew from and since then it's

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.699 
message grew from and since then it's
gone<00:04:19.940> on<00:04:20.000> to<00:04:20.269> be<00:04:20.390> deeper<00:04:20.959> into<00:04:21.229> health<00:04:21.440> when<00:04:21.680> i

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
gone on to be deeper into health when i

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.170 
gone on to be deeper into health when i
first<00:04:21.979> started<00:04:22.099> then<00:04:22.760> it<00:04:22.849> got<00:04:22.910> into<00:04:23.150> the

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
first started then it got into the

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.780 
first started then it got into the
environmental<00:04:23.840> side<00:04:24.020> will

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
environmental side will

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.820 
environmental side will
we<00:04:25.000> don't<00:04:25.150> need<00:04:25.330> to<00:04:25.450> be<00:04:25.570> raising<00:04:26.050> billions<00:04:26.590> of

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
we don't need to be raising billions of

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.890 
we don't need to be raising billions of
animals<00:04:27.040> feeding<00:04:27.640> them<00:04:27.940> billions<00:04:28.420> and

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
animals feeding them billions and

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.230 
animals feeding them billions and
billions<00:04:29.140> of<00:04:29.410> kilos<00:04:29.890> of<00:04:29.920> food<00:04:30.370> which<00:04:31.060> we're

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
billions of kilos of food which we're

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.570 
billions of kilos of food which we're
ripping<00:04:31.390> up<00:04:31.570> the<00:04:31.600> planet<00:04:31.840> to<00:04:32.140> plant<00:04:32.980> that<00:04:33.250> food

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
ripping up the planet to plant that food

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.490 
ripping up the planet to plant that food
to<00:04:33.910> feed<00:04:34.180> those<00:04:34.450> animals<00:04:34.510> when<00:04:35.140> we<00:04:35.230> could<00:04:35.380> be

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
to feed those animals when we could be

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.800 
to feed those animals when we could be
using<00:04:36.430> that<00:04:36.520> food<00:04:36.760> all<00:04:37.030> that<00:04:37.210> land<00:04:37.420> for<00:04:37.780> a

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
using that food all that land for a

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.870 
using that food all that land for a
different<00:04:38.200> purpose<00:04:38.230> or<00:04:39.010> just<00:04:39.340> leaving<00:04:39.640> it<00:04:39.700> and

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
different purpose or just leaving it and

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.520 
different purpose or just leaving it and
then<00:04:40.210> it<00:04:40.330> got<00:04:40.420> into<00:04:40.660> the<00:04:40.750> ethical<00:04:41.110> side<00:04:41.290> where

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
then it got into the ethical side where

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.230 
then it got into the ethical side where
I<00:04:41.560> actually<00:04:41.770> started<00:04:42.250> to<00:04:42.430> connect<00:04:43.000> with

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
I actually started to connect with

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.720 
I actually started to connect with
animals<00:04:44.050> on<00:04:44.290> a<00:04:44.350> on<00:04:44.740> a<00:04:44.770> deeper<00:04:45.190> level<00:04:45.220> whereas

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
animals on a on a deeper level whereas

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.940 
animals on a on a deeper level whereas
before<00:04:45.880> it<00:04:46.150> was<00:04:46.480> there<00:04:47.020> the<00:04:47.140> animals<00:04:47.470> I<00:04:47.560> play

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
before it was there the animals I play

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.530 
before it was there the animals I play
with<00:04:48.160> their<00:04:48.520> animals<00:04:48.940> that<00:04:49.060> get<00:04:49.180> killed

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
with their animals that get killed

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.360 
with their animals that get killed
they're<00:04:50.110> the<00:04:50.200> ones<00:04:50.380> I<00:04:50.470> go<00:04:50.590> and<00:04:50.710> look<00:04:50.830> at<00:04:51.040> that's

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
they're the ones I go and look at that's

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.010 
they're the ones I go and look at that's
where<00:04:51.580> my<00:04:51.700> vegan<00:04:51.850> message<00:04:52.090> came<00:04:52.570> from<00:04:52.600> it

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
where my vegan message came from it

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.500 
where my vegan message came from it
really<00:04:53.260> started<00:04:53.500> from<00:04:53.770> a<00:04:53.890> point<00:04:54.100> of<00:04:54.510> logistics

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
really started from a point of logistics

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.250 
really started from a point of logistics
and<00:04:55.920> mathematics<00:04:56.920> and<00:04:57.190> I<00:04:57.550> guess

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
and mathematics and I guess

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.600 
and mathematics and I guess
sustainability<00:04:59.260> so<00:04:59.800> hopefully<00:05:00.040> my<00:05:00.100> story<00:05:00.430> can

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
sustainability so hopefully my story can
