00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
chances we were transitioning from

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.250 
chances we were transitioning from
defense<00:04:37.030> to<00:04:37.120> offense<00:04:37.270> the<00:04:37.690> way<00:04:37.810> that<00:04:37.960> we<00:04:38.050> want

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
defense to offense the way that we want

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.710
