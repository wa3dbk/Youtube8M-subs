00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
case and I cut out the foam for a place

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.690 
case and I cut out the foam for a place
where<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:50.880> can<00:01:51.149> put<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:52.079> cables<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.490> power

supply and the microphone itself but
these<00:01:57.149> cases<00:01:57.659> protect<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.290> from<00:01:58.409> elements<00:01:59.159> and

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
these cases protect it from elements and

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.050 
these cases protect it from elements and
I'm<00:02:00.180> also<00:02:00.420> able<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.990> throw<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.740> an

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
I'm also able to throw it on to an

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
airplane put it underneath the airplane

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.830 
airplane put it underneath the airplane
and<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:05.009> comes<00:02:05.219> out<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.640> baggage<00:02:06.360> terminal

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
and it comes out of the baggage terminal

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.389 
and it comes out of the baggage terminal
and<00:02:07.020> it's<00:02:07.140> fine<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.740> takes<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.160> shock

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
and it's fine and it takes the shock

it's<00:02:45.310> a<00:02:45.459> common<00:02:45.879> tube<00:02:46.120> that<00:02:46.299> a<00:02:46.360> lot<00:02:46.659> of

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
it's a common tube that a lot of

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.470 
it's a common tube that a lot of
microphone<00:02:47.470> manufacturers<00:02:48.250> are<00:02:48.400> using<00:02:48.849> it's

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
microphone manufacturers are using it's

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.229 
microphone manufacturers are using it's
very<00:02:49.840> clean<00:02:50.290> they're<00:02:50.920> easy<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.489> come<00:02:51.730> by<00:02:51.760> and

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
very clean they're easy to come by and

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.960 
very clean they're easy to come by and
it's<00:02:52.840> just<00:02:53.080> an<00:02:53.230> easy<00:02:53.530> tube<00:02:53.920> to<00:02:54.159> work<00:02:54.370> with<00:02:54.640> kind

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
it's just an easy tube to work with kind

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.089 
it's just an easy tube to work with kind
of<00:02:55.060> reminds<00:02:55.330> me<00:02:55.420> of<00:02:55.569> an<00:02:55.750> AC<00:02:55.959> 701<00:02:56.709> tube

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
of reminds me of an AC 701 tube

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.009 
of reminds me of an AC 701 tube
I've<00:02:57.400> got<00:02:57.640> my<00:02:57.819> caps<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.540> my<00:02:59.019> resistors<00:02:59.709> we<00:03:01.019> are

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
I've got my caps and my resistors we are

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.640 
I've got my caps and my resistors we are
so<00:03:02.290> much<00:03:02.500> room<00:03:02.890> down<00:03:03.190> here<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.760> put<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.239> bigger

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
so much room down here to put a bigger

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.559 
so much room down here to put a bigger
output<00:03:05.650> transformer<00:03:06.370> right<00:03:06.700> now<00:03:06.879> I<00:03:06.910> have<00:03:07.299> a

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
output transformer right now I have a

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.869 
output transformer right now I have a
Jensen<00:03:08.110> output<00:03:08.470> transformer<00:03:09.159> but<00:03:09.579> I<00:03:09.610> could

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
Jensen output transformer but I could

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.750 
Jensen output transformer but I could
put<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.090> B<00:03:10.360> v8<00:03:10.780> or<00:03:10.989> a<00:03:11.049> larger<00:03:11.799> output

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
put a B v8 or a larger output

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.759 
put a B v8 or a larger output
transformer<00:03:13.690> in<00:03:13.810> here<00:03:14.049> it's<00:03:14.230> got<00:03:14.379> so<00:03:14.620> much

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
transformer in here it's got so much

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.190 
transformer in here it's got so much
room<00:03:15.069> to<00:03:15.099> do<00:03:15.370> so<00:03:15.579> so<00:03:16.239> I'll<00:03:16.629> put<00:03:16.989> it<00:03:17.079> back

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
room to do so so I'll put it back

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.990 
room to do so so I'll put it back
together<00:03:17.440> and<00:03:17.859> it<00:03:18.400> goes<00:03:18.609> back<00:03:18.819> together

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
together and it goes back together

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.320 
together and it goes back together
pretty<00:03:19.390> quickly

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
pretty quickly

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:28.420
