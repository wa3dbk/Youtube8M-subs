00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
tomatoes now there's a lot of really

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.720 
tomatoes now there's a lot of really
great<00:00:15.929> organic<00:00:16.529> potting<00:00:16.740> soils<00:00:17.250> out<00:00:17.460> there

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
great organic potting soils out there

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.189 
great organic potting soils out there
and<00:00:17.910> they're<00:00:18.060> usually<00:00:18.300> good<00:00:18.750> on<00:00:18.960> their<00:00:19.170> own

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
and they're usually good on their own

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.920 
and they're usually good on their own
but<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.220> like<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.760> give<00:00:20.910> Tomatoes<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.480> little

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
but I like to give Tomatoes a little

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.720 
but I like to give Tomatoes a little
extra<00:00:22.380> oomph<00:00:22.619> when<00:00:22.769> I'm<00:00:23.100> planting<00:00:23.400> them

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
extra oomph when I'm planting them

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.700 
extra oomph when I'm planting them
especially<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.420> containers<00:00:25.109> because<00:00:25.560> when

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
especially in containers because when

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.230 
especially in containers because when
you<00:00:25.830> grow<00:00:26.010> in<00:00:26.160> containers<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.000> water

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
you grow in containers and you water

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.939 
you grow in containers and you water
them<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.630> lot<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.900> times<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.230> nutrients<00:00:28.800> get

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
them a lot of times the nutrients get

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.380 
them a lot of times the nutrients get
leached<00:00:29.220> out<00:00:29.429> or<00:00:29.640> leaked<00:00:29.820> out<00:00:30.029> through<00:00:30.269> the

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
leached out or leaked out through the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.209 
leached out or leaked out through the
drainage<00:00:30.630> holes<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.740> think<00:00:31.890> any

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
drainage holes so I think any

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.979 
drainage holes so I think any
opportunity<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.090> can<00:00:33.300> give<00:00:33.450> your<00:00:33.570> tomato

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
opportunity you can give your tomato

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.860 
opportunity you can give your tomato
plants<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.559> little<00:00:34.680> extra<00:00:35.160> nutrition<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.059> a

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
plants a little extra nutrition and a

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.660 
plants a little extra nutrition and a
little<00:00:37.140> extra<00:00:37.469> soil<00:00:37.680> amendment<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.460> better

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
little extra soil amendment the better

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.549 
little extra soil amendment the better
it's<00:00:39.300> also<00:00:39.480> really<00:00:39.809> important<00:00:40.320> if<00:00:40.410> you're

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
it's also really important if you're

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.979 
it's also really important if you're
planting<00:00:40.950> tomatoes<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.670> ground<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.780> you

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
planting tomatoes in the ground that you

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.840 
planting tomatoes in the ground that you
do<00:00:43.200> amend<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.649> soil<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.670> give

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
do amend the soil so that you give

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.540 
do amend the soil so that you give
optimum<00:00:45.480> nutrition<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.200> soil<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
optimum nutrition to the soil so the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.880 
optimum nutrition to the soil so the
first<00:00:47.789> thing<00:00:48.000> I'm<00:00:48.149> going<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.390> use<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:49.020> some

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890

eggshells<00:01:02.520> which<00:01:03.329> add<00:01:03.570> calcium<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.379> soil

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
eggshells which add calcium to the soil

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.640
