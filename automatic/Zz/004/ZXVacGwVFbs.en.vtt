00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
sunlight and as far as reflections and

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.030 
sunlight and as far as reflections and
what<00:00:09.630> it<00:00:09.719> looks<00:00:09.870> like<00:00:10.019> I'm<00:00:10.679> not<00:00:10.740> going<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:10.980> be

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
what it looks like I'm not going to be

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.450 
what it looks like I'm not going to be
keeping<00:00:11.429> this<00:00:11.580> on<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.860> camera<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.219> way<00:00:14.309> it's

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
keeping this on the camera the way it's

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.730 
keeping this on the camera the way it's
mounted<00:00:14.610> it's<00:00:14.880> going<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.059> be<00:00:15.179> upset<00:00:16.170> I'm

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
mounted it's going to be upset I'm

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.710 
mounted it's going to be upset I'm
probably<00:00:17.279> on<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.490> separate<00:00:17.850> tripod<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.420> keep<00:00:18.449> it

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
probably on a separate tripod to keep it

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.990 
probably on a separate tripod to keep it
a<00:00:18.900> little<00:00:19.199> bit<00:00:19.320> more<00:00:19.439> stable<00:00:19.710> but<00:00:20.550> this<00:00:20.850> way

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
a little bit more stable but this way

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.529 
a little bit more stable but this way
you<00:00:21.060> can<00:00:21.270> see<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.869> has<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.080> matte<00:00:22.590> finish<00:00:22.619> on<00:00:23.279> the

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.990 

screen<00:00:27.570> in<00:00:28.170> sunlight<00:00:28.650> it's<00:00:29.310> not<00:00:29.460> too<00:00:29.609> bad<00:00:29.760> and

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
screen in sunlight it's not too bad and

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.820 
screen in sunlight it's not too bad and
then<00:00:30.300> I'll<00:00:30.390> put<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.689> shade<00:00:31.320> on<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.619> let<00:00:31.710> you

pretty clearly
a<00:00:46.550> little<00:00:47.180> bit<00:00:47.270> of<00:00:47.360> a<00:00:47.450> reflection<00:00:47.660> not<00:00:48.410> too<00:00:48.560> bad

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
a little bit of a reflection not too bad

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.170 
a little bit of a reflection not too bad
again<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.240> has<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.390> matte<00:00:51.690> finish<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.200> it<00:00:52.350> so

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
you see that's the V finder on my gh2 is

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.520 
you see that's the V finder on my gh2 is
actually<00:00:59.610> more<00:00:59.940> reflective<00:01:00.390> than<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
actually more reflective than the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.150 
actually more reflective than the
monitor<00:01:02.040> in<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:03.030> sunlight<00:01:03.360> so<00:01:04.020> let<00:01:04.890> me<00:01:04.980> grab

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
monitor in the sunlight so let me grab

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:12.200 
monitor in the sunlight so let me grab
the<00:01:05.400> sunshade<00:01:09.920> alright<00:01:10.920> this<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.760> the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
the sunshade alright this is the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.740 
the sunshade alright this is the
sunshade<00:01:12.950> it's<00:01:13.950> pretty<00:01:14.220> nice<00:01:15.740> it's<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:16.890> a

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
sunshade it's pretty nice it's like a

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.609 
sunshade it's pretty nice it's like a
heavy<00:01:18.750> nylon<00:01:19.250> with<00:01:20.250> maybe<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:21.350> cardboard<00:01:22.350> or

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
heavy nylon with maybe a cardboard or

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.550 
heavy nylon with maybe a cardboard or
something<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:23.010> the<00:01:23.100> inside<00:01:24.290> attaches<00:01:25.290> with

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
something on the inside attaches with

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.000 
something on the inside attaches with
Velcro<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:26.430> here<00:01:27.740> trying<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.800> do<00:01:28.920> it

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
Velcro on here trying to do it

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.040 
Velcro on here trying to do it
one-handed<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:30.000> show<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:31.760> but

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
one-handed to show you but

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.260 
one-handed to show you but
it<00:01:34.500> helps<00:01:34.770> quite<00:01:34.980> a<00:01:35.010> bit<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.730> cuts<00:01:35.940> down<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
it helps quite a bit it cuts down the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.440 
it helps quite a bit it cuts down the
reflections<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:37.760> course<00:01:38.760> I'm<00:01:38.970> wearing<00:01:39.210> a

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
reflections of course I'm wearing a

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.510 
reflections of course I'm wearing a

it's<00:01:51.250> a<00:01:52.560> little<00:01:53.560> bright<00:01:54.010> let<00:01:54.430> me<00:01:54.520> tone<00:01:55.270> it<00:01:55.420> down

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
it's a little bright let me tone it down

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.500 
it's a little bright let me tone it down
some

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.170 

this<00:02:01.140> little<00:02:01.500> adapter<00:02:02.010> is<00:02:02.280> made<00:02:02.340> for<00:02:02.820> holding

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
this little adapter is made for holding

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.760 
this little adapter is made for holding
my<00:02:03.330> LED<00:02:03.810> light<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.170> it's<00:02:04.290> going<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.470> be<00:02:04.560> really

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
my LED light so it's going to be really

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:15.530 
my LED light so it's going to be really
wobbly

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.539 

but<00:02:16.140> not<00:02:16.469> too<00:02:16.620> bad<00:02:16.799> and<00:02:17.040> then<00:02:17.219> the<00:02:17.340> focus

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
but not too bad and then the focus

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.649 
but not too bad and then the focus
peaking<00:02:18.290> it's<00:02:19.290> in<00:02:19.439> white<00:02:19.760> so<00:02:20.760> be<00:02:21.239> kind<00:02:21.390> of<00:02:21.480> hard

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
peaking it's in white so be kind of hard

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.770 
peaking it's in white so be kind of hard
to<00:02:21.750> see<00:02:21.930> in<00:02:21.959> this<00:02:22.140> bright<00:02:22.439> sunlight<00:02:22.950> but<00:02:23.780> let's

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
to see in this bright sunlight but let's

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.789 
to see in this bright sunlight but let's
see<00:02:24.930> if<00:02:25.019> you<00:02:25.140> can<00:02:25.290> see<00:02:25.799> it<00:02:27.409> try<00:02:28.409> to<00:02:28.469> get<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.650> on

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
see if you can see it try to get it on

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:36.490 
see if you can see it try to get it on
the<00:02:28.920> bucket

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.420 

hmm

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.100 

yeah<00:02:40.000> it's<00:02:40.209> really<00:02:40.360> hard<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.720> see<00:02:40.900> in<00:02:41.019> this

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
yeah it's really hard to see in this

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:51.960 
yeah it's really hard to see in this
sunlight<00:02:42.959> see<00:02:43.959> if<00:02:44.019> you<00:02:44.140> can<00:02:44.230> catch<00:02:44.409> the<00:02:44.620> bushes

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.110 

yeah<00:02:52.630> I<00:02:52.660> have<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.580> show<00:02:54.580> you<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.790> focus

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
yeah I have to show you the focus

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.350 
yeah I have to show you the focus
peaking<00:02:55.300> inside<00:02:56.200> as<00:02:56.860> just<00:02:57.580> you<00:02:58.000> start<00:02:58.180> picking

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
peaking inside as just you start picking

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.470 
peaking inside as just you start picking
up<00:02:58.630> on<00:02:58.810> this<00:02:58.900> little<00:02:59.110> camera<00:02:59.380> I'm<00:02:59.620> filming<00:03:00.070> on

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
up on this little camera I'm filming on
