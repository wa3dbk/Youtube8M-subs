hello<00:00:07.470> my<00:00:07.770> name<00:00:07.919> is<00:00:08.010> Lam<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:08.550> today<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.300> thought

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
hello my name is Lam and today I thought

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.600 
hello my name is Lam and today I thought
we<00:00:09.870> would<00:00:10.019> have<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.530> comparison<00:00:11.429> on<00:00:11.580> the

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
we would have a comparison on the

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.079 
we would have a comparison on the
turning<00:00:12.480> time<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:14.099> stealth<00:00:14.340> jet<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.759> the

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
turning time of the stealth jet and the

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.170 
turning time of the stealth jet and the
attack<00:00:15.809> jet<00:00:17.869> the<00:00:18.869> way<00:00:18.990> we<00:00:19.080> will<00:00:19.170> do<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.439> is

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
attack jet the way we will do this is

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.210 
attack jet the way we will do this is
I'll<00:00:21.180> run<00:00:21.420> through<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.980> series<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.100> different

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
I'll run through a series of different

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.410 
I'll run through a series of different
turns<00:00:23.609> with<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.289> pasta<00:00:25.289> jet<00:00:25.470> types<00:00:25.710> and

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
turns with the pasta jet types and

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.050 
turns with the pasta jet types and
record<00:00:27.890> the<00:00:28.890> time<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.310> takes<00:00:29.429> for<00:00:29.580> them<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.820> get

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
record the time it takes for them to get

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.229 
record the time it takes for them to get
a<00:00:30.090> full<00:00:30.630> turn<00:00:30.810> run<00:00:31.099> and<00:00:32.099> we'll<00:00:32.489> see<00:00:32.669> how<00:00:33.180> the

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
a full turn run and we'll see how the

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.049 
a full turn run and we'll see how the
comparison<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.500> first<00:00:34.770> up<00:00:34.950> we<00:00:35.160> have<00:00:35.190> the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
comparison is so first up we have the

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.750 
comparison is so first up we have the
stealth<00:00:36.420> jet<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:37.250> the<00:00:38.250> first<00:00:38.460> turn<00:00:38.610> will

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
stealth jet and the first turn will

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.450 
stealth jet and the first turn will
perform<00:00:39.059> Mary<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.710> simple<00:00:40.710> full<00:00:40.920> turn<00:00:41.100> with

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
perform Mary is simple full turn with

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.670 
perform Mary is simple full turn with
boosting<00:00:42.030> like<00:00:42.450> using<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.870> afterburner<00:00:43.379> just

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
boosting like using the afterburner just

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.569 
boosting like using the afterburner just
to<00:00:44.059> see<00:00:45.059> how<00:00:45.149> fast<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.600> will<00:00:45.690> go<00:00:46.910> this<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.120> not

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
to see how fast it will go this is not

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.330 
to see how fast it will go this is not
viable<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:51.000> dogfight<00:00:51.210> at<00:00:51.539> all<00:00:51.710> it<00:00:52.710> takes<00:00:53.100> a

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
viable in a dogfight at all it takes a

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.069 
viable in a dogfight at all it takes a
long<00:00:53.579> time<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:54.120> get<00:00:54.210> around<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.809> would<00:00:54.960> not

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
long time to get around and I would not

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.860 
long time to get around and I would not
recommend<00:00:55.289> anyone<00:00:55.860> actually<00:00:56.280> using<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:56.940> if

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
recommend anyone actually using it so if

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.970 
recommend anyone actually using it so if
you<00:00:58.109> have<00:00:58.230> been<00:00:58.410> please<00:00:59.280> stop<00:01:00.859> second<00:01:01.859> this

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
you have been please stop second this

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.929 
you have been please stop second this
normal<00:01:02.399> turn<00:01:02.640> it's<00:01:03.359> just<00:01:03.629> flying<00:01:04.439> normally

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
normal turn it's just flying normally

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.149 
normal turn it's just flying normally
round<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.150> circle<00:01:06.299> without<00:01:07.070> adding<00:01:08.070> or

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
round in a circle without adding or

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.760 
round in a circle without adding or
decreasing<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.700> speed<00:01:08.880> any<00:01:09.840> bit<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.320> that's

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
decreasing the speed any bit and that's

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.969 
decreasing the speed any bit and that's
us<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.070> nine<00:01:11.280> point<00:01:11.490> four<00:01:11.700> seconds<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.979> it's

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
us the nine point four seconds so it's

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.560 
us the nine point four seconds so it's
faster<00:01:14.369> than<00:01:14.460> at<00:01:14.580> least<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.090> RAM<00:01:15.299> ET

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570

afterburner home but it's still pretty
slow<00:01:19.939> now<00:01:20.939> for<00:01:21.090> good<00:01:21.240> measure<00:01:21.450> I've<00:01:21.810> also

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
slow now for good measure I've also

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.880 
slow now for good measure I've also
added<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:23.250> normal<00:01:23.939> turn<00:01:24.090> while<00:01:24.659> holding<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.439> D

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
added a normal turn while holding the D

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.359 
added a normal turn while holding the D
key<00:01:26.130> or<00:01:26.869> going<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.900> plane<00:01:28.200> around<00:01:29.040> with<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
key or going the plane around with the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.510 
key or going the plane around with the
turn<00:01:29.579> it's<00:01:30.450> something<00:01:31.409> I'm<00:01:31.470> just<00:01:31.530> used<00:01:32.310> to

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
turn it's something I'm just used to

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.200 
turn it's something I'm just used to
doing<00:01:32.729> while<00:01:33.090> flying<00:01:34.880> because<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.000> would<00:01:36.090> be

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
doing while flying because it would be

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.109 
doing while flying because it would be
natural<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.720> do<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.930> in<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.560> real<00:01:37.710> airplane<00:01:38.119> but

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
natural to do it in a real airplane but

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.240 
natural to do it in a real airplane but
I<00:01:39.150> haven't<00:01:39.689> really<00:01:40.110> decided<00:01:40.350> yet<00:01:40.650> if<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.100> gives

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
I haven't really decided yet if it gives

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.630 
I haven't really decided yet if it gives
you<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.460> consistent<00:01:42.299> benefits<00:01:43.200> or<00:01:44.100> not<00:01:44.340> since

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
you a consistent benefits or not since

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.420 
you a consistent benefits or not since
the<00:01:45.329> numbers<00:01:45.630> have<00:01:45.659> been<00:01:46.070> sometimes<00:01:47.070> lower

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
the numbers have been sometimes lower

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.120 
the numbers have been sometimes lower
and<00:01:47.700> sometimes<00:01:48.210> higher<00:01:48.509> when<00:01:49.200> completing<00:01:50.009> the

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
and sometimes higher when completing the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.149 
and sometimes higher when completing the
turn<00:01:50.720> now<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.810> magic<00:01:52.259> number<00:01:52.590> when<00:01:52.770> turning

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
turn now the magic number when turning

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.310 
turn now the magic number when turning
in<00:01:53.310> battle<00:01:53.700> 3<00:01:53.909> at<00:01:54.030> least<00:01:54.210> was<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.780> keep<00:01:55.140> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
in battle 3 at least was to keep the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.480 
in battle 3 at least was to keep the
plane<00:01:55.500> between<00:01:56.030> 300<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.090> 314<00:01:58.020> 314<00:01:58.860> was<00:01:59.250> like

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
plane between 300 and 314 314 was like

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.550 
plane between 300 and 314 314 was like
the<00:01:59.700> air<00:02:00.509> speed<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:01.530> really<00:02:01.829> wanted<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.159> have

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.710 

let's<00:02:05.010> see<00:02:05.190> how<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.490> plane<00:02:06.119> performs<00:02:06.570> them

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.720 

so<00:02:13.720> with<00:02:13.870> an<00:02:13.930> airspeed<00:02:14.140> of<00:02:14.290> three<00:02:14.709> between<00:02:15.220> 300

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
so with an airspeed of three between 300

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.350 
so with an airspeed of three between 300
314<00:02:16.330> it's<00:02:17.730> around<00:02:18.730> 7<00:02:18.970> seconds<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.760> again<00:02:22.150> for

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
314 it's around 7 seconds and again for

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.880 
314 it's around 7 seconds and again for
good<00:02:22.480> measure<00:02:22.810> we'll<00:02:23.080> try<00:02:23.319> to<00:02:23.380> do<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.739> same

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
good measure we'll try to do the same

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.240 
good measure we'll try to do the same

the D key to see if it actually gains us
anything<00:02:33.310> while<00:02:33.700> turning<00:02:38.430> which<00:02:39.599> at<00:02:40.599> this

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
anything while turning which at this

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:57.390 
anything while turning which at this
point<00:02:40.900> it<00:02:41.230> did<00:02:41.410> not

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.860 

and<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:58.550> be<00:02:58.640> certain<00:02:58.790> there<00:02:59.060> isn't<00:02:59.300> some<00:02:59.450> other

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
and to be certain there isn't some other

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.750 
and to be certain there isn't some other
kind<00:03:00.110> of<00:03:00.200> magic<00:03:00.680> number<00:03:00.980> with<00:03:01.130> turning<00:03:01.610> for

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
kind of magic number with turning for

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.570 
kind of magic number with turning for
the<00:03:01.790> stealth<00:03:02.300> jets<00:03:02.599> I'll<00:03:03.290> try<00:03:03.590> to<00:03:03.650> do<00:03:03.890> another

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
the stealth jets I'll try to do another

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.470 
the stealth jets I'll try to do another
term<00:03:04.790> with<00:03:05.030> an<00:03:05.989> airspeed<00:03:06.349> around<00:03:06.620> 280<00:03:07.390> just<00:03:08.390> to

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
term with an airspeed around 280 just to

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.790 
term with an airspeed around 280 just to
see<00:03:08.660> how<00:03:08.840> well<00:03:09.400> we<00:03:10.400> perform<00:03:10.580> them<00:03:11.890> mm<00:03:12.890> yeah

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
see how well we perform them mm yeah

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.970 
see how well we perform them mm yeah
still<00:03:15.800> not<00:03:15.980> as<00:03:16.069> good<00:03:16.540> as<00:03:17.540> that<00:03:18.370> 300<00:03:19.370> or<00:03:19.459> 314

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
still not as good as that 300 or 314

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.290 
still not as good as that 300 or 314
however<00:03:21.980> if<00:03:22.130> we<00:03:23.200> do<00:03:24.200> continues<00:03:24.680> turn<00:03:24.890> I<00:03:25.550> think

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
however if we do continues turn I think

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.180 
however if we do continues turn I think
the<00:03:26.360> best<00:03:26.510> time<00:03:26.630> I'd<00:03:26.900> was<00:03:27.110> around<00:03:27.380> six<00:03:27.980> point

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
the best time I'd was around six point

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:36.130 
the best time I'd was around six point
four<00:03:28.370> or<00:03:28.640> something<00:03:33.610> so<00:03:34.610> now<00:03:34.760> let's<00:03:35.000> do<00:03:35.239> a<00:03:35.720> few

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
four or something so now let's do a few

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.850 
four or something so now let's do a few
the<00:03:36.290> same<00:03:36.500> terms<00:03:36.739> with<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:37.459> bomber<00:03:38.650> so<00:03:39.650> for<00:03:39.830> a

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
the same terms with the bomber so for a

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.199 
the same terms with the bomber so for a
normal<00:03:40.190> turn<00:03:40.599> flying<00:03:41.599> it<00:03:41.840> just<00:03:42.049> cruise<00:03:42.620> speeds

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
normal turn flying it just cruise speeds

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.640 
normal turn flying it just cruise speeds
the<00:03:44.209> plane<00:03:44.390> will<00:03:44.569> turn<00:03:44.959> at<00:03:45.140> eight<00:03:45.319> point<00:03:45.590> three

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
the plane will turn at eight point three

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
the plane will turn at eight point three
seconds<00:03:46.310> which<00:03:47.030> is<00:03:47.980> what's<00:03:48.980> the<00:03:49.160> faster<00:03:49.489> than

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
seconds which is what's the faster than

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.250 
seconds which is what's the faster than
the<00:03:49.849> stealth<00:03:50.269> fighter<00:03:50.330> which<00:03:50.660> was<00:03:50.840> turning<00:03:51.170> at

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
the stealth fighter which was turning at

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.380 
the stealth fighter which was turning at
nine<00:03:51.440> point<00:03:51.650> four<00:03:54.069> so<00:03:55.069> try<00:03:55.310> to<00:03:55.340> do<00:03:55.580> the<00:03:55.730> same

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
nine point four so try to do the same

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:57.070 
nine point four so try to do the same
turn<00:03:56.630> again

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
turn again

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.890 
turn again
but<00:03:57.650> while<00:03:57.860> holding<00:03:58.130> the<00:03:58.730> D<00:03:59.180> key<00:03:59.420> this<00:03:59.630> time

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
but while holding the D key this time

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:09.510 
but while holding the D key this time
and<00:04:00.200> see<00:04:01.130> how<00:04:02.030> that<00:04:02.209> forms

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.030 

and<00:04:10.060> it<00:04:10.300> should<00:04:10.510> give<00:04:10.690> us<00:04:10.720> a<00:04:11.170> slightly<00:04:11.800> better

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
and it should give us a slightly better

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:19.099 
and it should give us a slightly better
time

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.499 

so<00:04:19.650> now<00:04:19.799> if<00:04:19.919> we<00:04:20.189> reduce<00:04:20.729> the<00:04:20.849> speed<00:04:21.030> to<00:04:21.090> a<00:04:21.269> more

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:21.509 
so now if we reduce the speed to a more

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:23.830 
so now if we reduce the speed to a more
optimal<00:04:21.959> turning<00:04:22.379> speed<00:04:22.620> for<00:04:22.949> the<00:04:23.069> bombuh

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
optimal turning speed for the bombuh

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:30.050 
optimal turning speed for the bombuh
we<00:04:24.840> will<00:04:25.129> net<00:04:26.129> around<00:04:28.550> six<00:04:29.550> point<00:04:29.819> four

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
we will net around six point four

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.990 
we will net around six point four
seconds<00:04:30.599> which<00:04:31.469> is<00:04:31.620> already<00:04:31.889> vastly<00:04:32.400> faster

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
seconds which is already vastly faster

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.170 
seconds which is already vastly faster
than<00:04:33.479> the<00:04:33.719> stealth<00:04:34.020> jet<00:04:34.759> already<00:04:35.759> has<00:04:35.909> a

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
than the stealth jet already has a

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.869 
than the stealth jet already has a
faster<00:04:36.719> turning<00:04:37.020> radius<00:04:37.349> than<00:04:38.340> the<00:04:38.520> jet<00:04:38.699> which

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:38.879 
faster turning radius than the jet which

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:41.300 
faster turning radius than the jet which
means<00:04:39.120> of<00:04:39.360> course<00:04:39.599> it<00:04:39.780> will<00:04:39.840> win<00:04:40.050> dog<00:04:41.039> fights

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
means of course it will win dog fights

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.529 
means of course it will win dog fights
against<00:04:41.759> nerve<00:04:41.939> superiority<00:04:42.539> fighter<00:04:44.509> now<00:04:45.509> I

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
against nerve superiority fighter now I

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.429 
against nerve superiority fighter now I
will<00:04:45.719> do<00:04:45.900> a<00:04:46.139> second<00:04:47.129> turn<00:04:47.250> at<00:04:47.419> 3:14<00:04:48.439> while

00:04:49.429 --> 00:04:49.439 
will do a second turn at 3:14 while

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:51.860 
will do a second turn at 3:14 while
holding<00:04:49.620> D<00:04:49.919> to<00:04:50.099> see<00:04:50.310> if<00:04:51.150> we<00:04:51.300> can<00:04:51.389> improve<00:04:51.659> our

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
holding D to see if we can improve our

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.390 
holding D to see if we can improve our
turn<00:04:52.110> even<00:04:52.500> more<00:04:54.020> and<00:04:55.020> if<00:04:55.979> I<00:04:56.069> remember

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
turn even more and if I remember

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.330 
turn even more and if I remember
correctly<00:04:56.669> yep<00:04:57.270> we<00:04:57.900> got<00:04:58.050> a<00:04:58.080> turn<00:04:58.289> time<00:04:58.500> of<00:04:58.710> six

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
correctly yep we got a turn time of six

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.649 
correctly yep we got a turn time of six
seconds<00:04:59.819> which<00:05:00.719> is<00:05:00.750> pretty<00:05:01.139> good<00:05:01.800> so<00:05:02.419> even<00:05:03.419> for

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:03.659 
seconds which is pretty good so even for

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:05.990 
seconds which is pretty good so even for
dogfights<00:05:04.110> with<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:05.310> main<00:05:05.460> gun<00:05:05.639> of<00:05:05.849> this

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
dogfights with the main gun of this

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.029 
dogfights with the main gun of this
aircraft<00:05:06.719> I<00:05:07.110> will<00:05:07.259> actually<00:05:07.530> recommend<00:05:07.889> using

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
aircraft I will actually recommend using

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.999 
aircraft I will actually recommend using
the<00:05:08.370> Bombur<00:05:08.759> to<00:05:09.419> take<00:05:09.599> out<00:05:09.780> other<00:05:10.009> aircraft

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:11.009 
the Bombur to take out other aircraft

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:14.149 
the Bombur to take out other aircraft
and<00:05:11.340> helicopters<00:05:12.020> first<00:05:13.020> you<00:05:13.110> can<00:05:13.289> do<00:05:13.620> work<00:05:13.949> on

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:14.159 
and helicopters first you can do work on

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:16.550 
and helicopters first you can do work on
ground<00:05:14.460> targets<00:05:14.909> but<00:05:15.690> and<00:05:15.870> again<00:05:16.050> I<00:05:16.139> consider

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
ground targets but and again I consider

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.929 
ground targets but and again I consider
the<00:05:16.740> stealth<00:05:17.189> fighter<00:05:17.810> more<00:05:18.810> of<00:05:18.930> a<00:05:19.080> harassment

00:05:19.929 --> 00:05:19.939 
the stealth fighter more of a harassment

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:22.640 
the stealth fighter more of a harassment
aircraft<00:05:20.939> since<00:05:21.150> you<00:05:21.270> can<00:05:21.419> get<00:05:21.569> after<00:05:22.349> all

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
aircraft since you can get after all

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.800 
aircraft since you can get after all
some<00:05:23.159> decent<00:05:23.520> rockets<00:05:23.940> at<00:05:24.060> least<00:05:24.240> on<00:05:24.389> it

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
some decent rockets at least on it

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.110 
some decent rockets at least on it
I<00:05:24.840> think<00:05:25.650> the<00:05:25.770> active<00:05:26.310> radar<00:05:26.490> Rockets<00:05:26.909> would

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
I think the active radar Rockets would

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.290 
I think the active radar Rockets would
be<00:05:27.270> really<00:05:28.080> well<00:05:28.229> for<00:05:28.469> the<00:05:28.560> stealth<00:05:28.979> jets<00:05:29.300> then

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
be really well for the stealth jets then

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.240 
be really well for the stealth jets then
you<00:05:30.389> can<00:05:30.539> annoy<00:05:30.779> everyone<00:05:31.379> else<00:05:31.740> in<00:05:32.009> the<00:05:32.099> air

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
you can annoy everyone else in the air

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.490 
you can annoy everyone else in the air
and<00:05:32.659> it<00:05:33.659> will<00:05:33.750> actually<00:05:33.870> work<00:05:34.020> well<00:05:34.349> in

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
and it will actually work well in

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.499 
and it will actually work well in
hardcore<00:05:35.069> mode<00:05:35.129> when<00:05:35.490> they<00:05:35.639> can't<00:05:35.879> see<00:05:36.150> you<00:05:36.330> on

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:36.509 
hardcore mode when they can't see you on

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:39.140 
hardcore mode when they can't see you on
the<00:05:36.629> map<00:05:36.810> as<00:05:37.110> easily<00:05:37.919> so<00:05:38.490> you<00:05:38.520> can<00:05:38.729> try<00:05:38.909> to<00:05:38.969> stay

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
the map as easily so you can try to stay

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.329 
the map as easily so you can try to stay
hidden<00:05:39.300> and<00:05:39.599> just<00:05:39.839> hit<00:05:40.770> them<00:05:40.919> from<00:05:41.009> unknown

00:05:41.329 --> 00:05:41.339 
hidden and just hit them from unknown

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:44.269 
hidden and just hit them from unknown
angles<00:05:41.960> now<00:05:42.960> finally<00:05:43.379> I<00:05:43.409> will<00:05:43.650> try<00:05:43.919> to<00:05:43.949> do<00:05:44.190> a

00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:44.279 
angles now finally I will try to do a

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:46.189 
angles now finally I will try to do a
slow<00:05:44.639> turn<00:05:44.909> with<00:05:45.120> the<00:05:45.270> attack<00:05:45.719> jet<00:05:45.900> as<00:05:46.020> well

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 
slow turn with the attack jet as well

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.610 
slow turn with the attack jet as well
just<00:05:46.409> to<00:05:46.529> see<00:05:47.479> if<00:05:48.479> it<00:05:48.750> turns<00:05:48.900> faster<00:05:49.379> or<00:05:49.500> slower

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
just to see if it turns faster or slower

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.240 
just to see if it turns faster or slower
when<00:05:50.159> you<00:05:50.279> go<00:05:50.400> below<00:05:50.550> 300<00:05:51.240> and<00:05:52.039> it<00:05:53.039> actually

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
when you go below 300 and it actually

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.760 
when you go below 300 and it actually
takes<00:05:53.520> a<00:05:53.729> big<00:05:53.879> hit<00:05:54.120> to<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:54.599> turning<00:05:55.199> speed<00:05:55.409> so

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
takes a big hit to the turning speed so

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.070 
takes a big hit to the turning speed so
it's<00:05:56.699> more<00:05:56.940> important<00:05:57.419> to<00:05:57.509> have<00:05:57.750> a<00:05:57.810> consistent

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
it's more important to have a consistent

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.269 
it's more important to have a consistent
flying<00:05:58.650> with<00:05:59.039> the<00:05:59.219> attack<00:05:59.580> bomber<00:05:59.819> at<00:06:00.000> least

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:01.279 
flying with the attack bomber at least

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:03.619 
flying with the attack bomber at least
well<00:06:02.279> I<00:06:02.460> hope<00:06:02.729> you<00:06:02.879> found<00:06:03.029> this<00:06:03.240> video<00:06:03.449> useful

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:03.629 
well I hope you found this video useful
