00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
more healthy so I really like this and I

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.810 
more healthy so I really like this and I
think<00:02:00.540> it's<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.719> great<00:02:00.930> option<00:02:01.110> it's<00:02:01.590> um<00:02:02.070> right

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
think it's a great option it's um right

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.260 
think it's a great option it's um right
now<00:02:02.969> it's<00:02:03.540> like<00:02:03.719> 350<00:02:04.350> at<00:02:04.590> Big<00:02:04.890> Lots<00:02:05.030> at<00:02:06.030> least

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
now it's like 350 at Big Lots at least

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.089 
now it's like 350 at Big Lots at least
at<00:02:06.390> my<00:02:06.479> Big<00:02:06.659> Lots<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.439> should<00:02:07.740> definitely

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
at my Big Lots so you should definitely

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:08.889 
at my Big Lots so you should definitely
check<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.280> out

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
check that out

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.780 
check that out
cuz<00:02:09.899> it's<00:02:10.110> very<00:02:10.410> portable<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.489> I<00:02:11.580> think

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
cuz it's very portable and I think

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.300 
cuz it's very portable and I think
regularly<00:02:12.300> it's<00:02:12.510> like<00:02:12.660> $10

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
regularly it's like $10

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.490 
regularly it's like $10
or<00:02:13.459> something<00:02:13.760> like<00:02:13.849> that<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:14.390> then<00:02:15.319> the<00:02:15.470> next

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
or something like that and then the next

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.470 
or something like that and then the next
thing<00:02:15.830> that<00:02:15.860> I<00:02:16.010> want<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.280> mention<00:02:16.400> is<00:02:16.880> this
