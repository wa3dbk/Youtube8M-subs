the<00:00:38.399> radiation<00:00:39.000> it's<00:00:39.180> really<00:00:39.450> important<00:00:39.899> for

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
the radiation it's really important for

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.530 
the radiation it's really important for
us<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.290> trying<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.739> do<00:00:40.860> as<00:00:41.190> exact<00:00:41.760> as<00:00:42.000> we<00:00:42.210> can't

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
us to trying to do as exact as we can't

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.040 
us to trying to do as exact as we can't
be<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.379> we<00:00:44.070> initially<00:00:44.640> got<00:00:44.700> our<00:00:45.239> first<00:00:45.510> acula

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
be so we initially got our first acula

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.950 
be so we initially got our first acula
from<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.190> Karen<00:00:47.489> collection<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.510> because<00:00:48.719> we

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
from the Karen collection so because we

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.260 
from the Karen collection so because we
then<00:00:49.350> were<00:00:49.559> able<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.010> use<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.520> imrt<00:00:50.879> on<00:00:51.239> a

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
then were able to use the imrt on a

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.229 
then were able to use the imrt on a
greater<00:00:51.539> number<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.960> gentlemen<00:00:52.730> we<00:00:53.730> had<00:00:54.210> a

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
greater number of gentlemen we had a

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.779 
greater number of gentlemen we had a
need<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:54.870> more<00:00:54.899> planning<00:00:55.800> computers<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.579> them

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
need for more planning computers to them

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.729 
need for more planning computers to them
than<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> current<00:00:57.629> collection<00:00:58.079> kind<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.620> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
than the current collection kind of the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.150 
than the current collection kind of the
plan<00:00:59.010> computer<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.879> then<00:01:00.829> because<00:01:01.829> we<00:01:02.010> now

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
plan computer and then because we now

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.290 
plan computer and then because we now
have<00:01:02.370> more<00:01:02.550> patients<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.090> were<00:01:03.180> actually

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
have more patients that were actually

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.440 
have more patients that were actually
utilizing<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.080> technology<00:01:04.739> for<00:01:05.240> then<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
utilizing that technology for then the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.260 
utilizing that technology for then the
characterization<00:01:07.350> as<00:01:08.189> these<00:01:08.430> computers<00:01:08.939> so

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
characterization as these computers so

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.090 
characterization as these computers so
you<00:01:09.960> know<00:01:10.080> sort<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.530> through<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.799> whole

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
you know sort of through the whole

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.160 
you know sort of through the whole
continuum<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:12.270> Karen<00:01:12.600> collection<00:01:12.990> has

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
continuum that Karen collection has

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.050 
continuum that Karen collection has
allowed<00:01:13.439> us<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.950> build<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.580> part<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.000> the

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
allowed us to build this part of the

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.940 
allowed us to build this part of the
program<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.689> way<00:01:15.780> that's<00:01:16.020> been<00:01:16.200> really<00:01:16.350> you

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
program in a way that's been really you

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.010 
program in a way that's been really you
know<00:01:17.040> fantastic<00:01:17.700> for<00:01:17.880> us<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.869> where

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
know fantastic for us and this is where

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.359 
know fantastic for us and this is where
a<00:01:19.049> gift<00:01:19.350> from<00:01:19.560> an<00:01:19.740> organization<00:01:20.220> like<00:01:20.250> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
a gift from an organization like the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.609 
a gift from an organization like the
Cary<00:01:20.640> collection<00:01:20.729> can<00:01:21.330> really<00:01:21.659> make<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> big

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
Cary collection can really make a big

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.950 
Cary collection can really make a big
difference<00:01:22.979> because<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:24.119> allowed<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.720> gives

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
difference because it allowed it gives

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.550 
difference because it allowed it gives
us<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.170> sort<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.500> flexibility<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.939> kind<00:01:27.150> of

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
us that sort of flexibility to kind of

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.990 
us that sort of flexibility to kind of
by<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.619> sorts<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.159> things<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.579> pay<00:01:29.759> for<00:01:29.939> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
by the sorts of things to pay for the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.420 
by the sorts of things to pay for the
kinds<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.360> things<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:31.009> there's<00:01:32.009> not<00:01:32.189> really

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
kinds of things that there's not really

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.600 
kinds of things that there's not really
any<00:01:32.700> other<00:01:32.880> mechanism<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.920> pay<00:01:34.920> for<00:01:35.220> there's

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
any other mechanism to pay for there's

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.510 
any other mechanism to pay for there's
no<00:01:35.729> special<00:01:36.090> grant<00:01:36.630> from<00:01:36.960> NIH<00:01:37.439> for<00:01:37.710> example<00:01:38.189> at

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
no special grant from NIH for example at

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.740 
no special grant from NIH for example at
least<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.850> I'm<00:01:38.970> aware<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.540> pace<00:01:39.720> for

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
least that I'm aware of the pace for

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.140 
least that I'm aware of the pace for
upgrades<00:01:40.520> even<00:01:41.520> though<00:01:41.640> everyone<00:01:42.000> had

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
upgrades even though everyone had

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.819 
upgrades even though everyone had
reasons<00:01:42.450> upgrades<00:01:42.780> are<00:01:42.930> vital<00:01:43.350> importance

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
reasons upgrades are vital importance

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.350 
reasons upgrades are vital importance
the<00:01:44.130> way<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.430> actually<00:01:44.610> pay<00:01:44.970> for<00:01:45.210> them

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
the way that you actually pay for them

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.649 
the way that you actually pay for them
is<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.930> lot<00:01:46.229> less<00:01:46.470> clear<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.460> way<00:01:47.670> it's

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
is a lot less clear and so this way it's

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.630 
is a lot less clear and so this way it's
really<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.020> flexibility<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.770> get

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
really the flexibility to get

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.480 
really the flexibility to get
Cary<00:01:50.940> collection<00:01:51.500> allows<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:53.130> amount<00:01:53.460> of

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
Cary collection allows that amount of

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.520 
Cary collection allows that amount of
