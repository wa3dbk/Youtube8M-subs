00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.760
 hello my friends today i have one 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.980
 small presentation of two placeable 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.520
 animals to this I have been around forever 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.070
 waited 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.700
 and that's why it's worth a video for me 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.500
 and I thank forward equal loose 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.970
 I hope I have your name 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.670
 properly pronounced for this 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.660
 have done wonderful work if it is 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.930
 enriches one 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.080
 but a highly really going on around them 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.730
 these animals so go out of it all 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.190
 this is about these little animals 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.510
 I have some ideas for this as well 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.830
 I just tell you 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.680
 like you might like these animals 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.420
 bavaria hof everyday life can integrate with 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.309
 we have a nice pony here 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:58.229
 pig a donkey and a ram 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:01:01.080
 or about a single race 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:02.280
 Well , let's continue with the fence drum 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.409
 I really want to get rid of you 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.990
 show you can fence the animals for you 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.790
 can from - a herd of ten sheep 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.650
 walk around and do a simple fence drum 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.140
 there are placeable testify apples 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.060
 You can take this one on a big one 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.969
 meadow that needs him could be a beautiful 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.469
 Place old barn like this 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:21.450
 here for example and could the animals 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:22.079
 put around it and therefore one 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.539
 fence 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:27.479
 you can just do that much with 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.280
 these animals because there are many 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.979
 Maps for large areas are still available 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.189
 and there are missing somewhere animals and 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.890
 I'll tell donkeys or ponies or something like that or 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.509
 also pigs or sheep need now 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.829
 not every day in the barn but 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.750
 we can stay outside in summer 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.609
 stay and that's why it hurts 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.899
 even then so I have now 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:48.119
 another idea for you like you 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.700
 of course, the animals even more in the yard 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.649
 not only can integrate everyday life 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.999
 while standing to have this but there have 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.729
 I then have this for me then 

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:58.160
 this water barrel for you that is now 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.470
 not there 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.920
 but there is a search for it and something 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.780
 Find 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.570
 You can grasp this water on the 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.190
 Meadow the animals are getting away 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.210
 drink 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.300
 the water will be better 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.100
 automatically less and could do with it 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.620
 drive the meadow and this barrel 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.780
 repeat and refuel and again 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.820
 So bring it to you will be this 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.370
 Animals also incorporate a certain amount 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.430
 Rene esterbauer wanted every team 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.930
 needs water and yes to feeding there 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.370
 then there's a little something that got 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.170
 I wrote before unprepared and 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.750
 Although there is still this here 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.940
 peterwagen there you can all of you 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.000
 Three then put the with the 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.650
 time disappear and quasi could thus 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.960
 then these animals are stranded 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.690
 because now wanted and so you can 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.010
 quasi a nice area 1 should 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.360
 in an old building in the middle 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.240
 put or a small hut 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.060
 produce themselves inside 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.190
 can hide and so you can one 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.290
 Build both right with placeable in 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.820
 things and could then also 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.010
 and that she water him 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.320
 brings that brings their feed and 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.030
 that is then actually again 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.450
 normal work step on one 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.150
 farm and definitely 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.710
 look at the whole thing myself and me 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.800
 thank you again this beautiful 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.800
 nice fashion package until next euro
