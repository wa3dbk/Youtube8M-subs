00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.770
 in this video I will explain 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.600
 why I gave the rating of 19 out of 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.600
 8 pm the witcher three wild hunt 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.540
 first of all for his universe cd projekt 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.920
 red his developer transposes here a 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.989
 saga in an open world 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.910
 a risky bet since the game could have been 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.680
 fall into the banal zone filling 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.220
 with big shots of content without big 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.440
 interest 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.629
 but here it's the other way around 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.910
 rightly produces the witcher 3 offer 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.680
 a devilishly large gaming surface that 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.479
 even the luxury of serving 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.900
 theater to a screenwriting plot of a 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.080
 rare quality well blurred plane 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.570
 to talk to me is to kill, I present to you 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.790
 gerald two banks happy to see you again 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.140
 it's very simple the story of the game is 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.880
 panting from end to end 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.860
 we always play the witcher 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.970
 giralt two shores looking for this 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.460
 two women's times that counts 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.030
 a lot for him on one side his love 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.070
 always 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.350
 the magician guin fr of berg 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.640
 and on the other Syria his adopted daughter 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.380
 whose rumor says she would be 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.680
 return from the confines of space and 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.510
 time 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.280
 she is pursued by the riders 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.230
 ghostly wild hunt 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.360
 so it's a real race against 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.290
 the watch but also against the death that 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.800
 unfolds before our eyes 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.960
 kiraithe hi brice 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.900
 because the witcher's universe is at once 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.000
 realistic and imbued with realistic magic 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.250
 in the sense that the witcher saga plays 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.170
 in the yard of mature rpg she approaches 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.020
 so many strong themes like 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.729
 ravages of war human misery 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.890
 obscurantism where greed with a 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.959
 rather serious approach tinted however 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.459
 of a certain novel cynicism of 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:18.769
 the Polish writer andrzej sapkowski 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:20.120
 from which comes the magic saga also because 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.310
 many quests will involve 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.350
 curse and spells of all kinds 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.750
 in a world at war where magic and 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.230
 strongly condemned since the invasions 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.000
 nice guardian the title to you 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.920
 will therefore ship for more than 100 hours 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.450
 between main missions 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.040
 side quests that did not 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.570
 secondary that was so they 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.790
 are well written and well directed 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.209
 quite exploration hunting 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.280
 monsters 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.350
 all on a huge open map 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.280
 whose aesthetics and attention to detail 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.480
 would pale many other open world 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.680
 technically now from wilshere 3 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.730
 is probably not at the level of what 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.650
 the trailer could have left us 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.780
 believe a few months ago but hey the 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.640
 overall graphic quality of the game enough 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.269
 to somewhat forget would be given 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.100
 technical 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.280
 the console version even feel rather 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.800
 hands down with qualities 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.140
 l undeniable dynamic lighting effects 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.670
 outdoor transition weather 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.130
 without loading time 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.160
 In short, we are dealing with the heavy of the very 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.160
 heavy 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.670
 the title however suffers from some 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.799
 clipping concerns about the vegetation by 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.870
 example or on some textures the 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.180
 physical motor also sometimes tends 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.920
 to get excited and on the framerate side 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.330
 we feel that the playstation 4 crash a 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.659
 little bit his guts on some 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.360
 scenes 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:34.069
 the 30 fps are required but we note 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.420
 still some falls when the 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.790
 sets are loaded in detail 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.379
 whatever the title is 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.819
 all the same here in the top of the basket 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.950
 technical one regarding this version 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:46.209
 console especially when we know that we 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.209
 talk about an open world 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.410
 as a good witcher gerald has yet 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.640
 fine tune his control of the fight with 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.590
 always these two were flanked 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.090
 andoain a steel for men 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.519
 another money for monsters 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.769
 our hero gains fluidity in the 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.750
 clashes between dodgy well animated 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.549
 and timely parade the gameplay of 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.829
 fighting is pretty jubilant and takes 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.750
 finally look like arkham at the 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:10.370
 medieval sprinkled with a touch of 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.200
 magic since geyrhalter two shores has 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:19.430
 always have access to these 5 6 to help him 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:20.989
 fight inventory menu craft harvest 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.700
 character progression all this is 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.470
 much more developed in the written test 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.060
 that I invite you to read but know 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.490
 that the very still a good one in 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.950
 before and complete of very nice way a 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.020
 tangible yet tangible array 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.770
 superb which we have all the trouble to 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.210
 witcher 3 to clinch deserves his note 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.700
 trilogy found in this last part 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.580
 a remarkably successful conclusion where 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.740
 there will always be something to do 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:49.419
 in short, a game that any fan of RPG is 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.419
 should at least try once
