00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:19.700 
plane engine was something you and I

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.310 
plane engine was something you and I
like<00:00:19.939> them<00:00:20.119> the<00:00:20.210> sound<00:00:20.450> of<00:00:20.630> it<00:00:20.720> and<00:00:20.990> it's

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
like them the sound of it and it's

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.979 
like them the sound of it and it's
really<00:00:21.860> really<00:00:22.250> good<00:00:22.570> before<00:00:23.570> they<00:00:23.689> had<00:00:23.809> no

00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:23.989 
really really good before they had no

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:25.510 
really really good before they had no
seven<00:00:24.259> or<00:00:24.349> six<00:00:24.559> and<00:00:24.860> it's<00:00:24.980> kind<00:00:25.130> of<00:00:25.160> weird<00:00:25.369> oh

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.520 
seven or six and it's kind of weird oh

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.280 
seven or six and it's kind of weird oh
they're<00:00:26.210> both<00:00:26.360> similar<00:00:26.570> but<00:00:26.960> you<00:00:27.169> have<00:00:27.259> the

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:27.290 
they're both similar but you have the

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.499 
they're both similar but you have the
same<00:00:27.470> time<00:00:27.649> both<00:00:27.800> very<00:00:28.070> different<00:00:28.430> they<00:00:29.360> both

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:29.509

have a tendency to bog down the r6

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.639 
have a tendency to bog down the r6
problem<00:00:32.149> was<00:00:32.270> didn't<00:00:32.840> have<00:00:32.960> much<00:00:32.989> low<00:00:33.350> end<00:00:33.530> or

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
problem was didn't have much low end or

the<00:00:39.950> bogging<00:00:40.310> down<00:00:40.340> and<00:00:40.760> it's<00:00:40.880> kind<00:00:41.150> of<00:00:41.210> hard

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
the bogging down and it's kind of hard

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.160 
the bogging down and it's kind of hard
to<00:00:42.080> keep<00:00:42.290> a<00:00:42.440> smooth<00:00:42.710> I<00:00:43.070> guess<00:00:44.170> consistent

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
have finesse on the turn on the r1 you

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.370 
have finesse on the turn on the r1 you
can<00:00:58.010> go<00:00:58.340> into<00:00:58.489> turn<00:00:58.820> give<00:00:59.750> it<00:00:59.870> the<00:00:59.960> throttle<00:01:00.290> in

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
can go into turn give it the throttle in

incredible it's like all yamaha's very
good<00:01:03.890> chassis<00:01:04.070> designs<00:01:04.549> but<00:01:04.759> that<00:01:04.879> rear<00:01:05.089> it's

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
good chassis designs but that rear it's

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.630 
good chassis designs but that rear it's
it's<00:01:06.320> just<00:01:06.500> an<00:01:06.590> incredible<00:01:06.979> feeling<00:01:07.040> when<00:01:07.399> you

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
it's just an incredible feeling when you

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.670 
it's just an incredible feeling when you
get<00:01:07.790> it<00:01:07.880> to<00:01:08.000> stick<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:08.479> you<00:01:08.780> give<00:01:09.320> it<00:01:09.439> the<00:01:09.530> gas

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
get it to stick and you give it the gas

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.069 
get it to stick and you give it the gas
it<00:01:10.310> manages<00:01:10.939> to<00:01:11.119> pull<00:01:11.479> you<00:01:11.630> around<00:01:11.689> the<00:01:11.899> turn

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:12.079 
it manages to pull you around the turn

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:13.419 
it manages to pull you around the turn
and<00:01:12.289> you<00:01:12.469> can<00:01:12.590> feel<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:12.829> front<00:01:13.039> again<00:01:13.069> really

00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:13.429 
and you can feel the front again really

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:14.859 
and you can feel the front again really
light<00:01:13.609> and<00:01:13.819> that's<00:01:14.329> just<00:01:14.509> a<00:01:14.569> really<00:01:14.749> good

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
light and that's just a really good

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.389 
light and that's just a really good
feeling<00:01:15.079> just<00:01:15.409> like<00:01:15.920> there's<00:01:16.100> nothing<00:01:16.159> like

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
feeling just like there's nothing like

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:18.969 
feeling just like there's nothing like
it<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:17.179> r6<00:01:17.600> was<00:01:17.840> just<00:01:18.289> like<00:01:18.380> a<00:01:18.469> knife<00:01:18.649> you

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
it the r6 was just like a knife you

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.709 
it the r6 was just like a knife you
would<00:01:19.100> cut<00:01:19.310> through<00:01:19.429> turns<00:01:19.700> very<00:01:20.060> smooth<00:01:20.420> a

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:20.719 
would cut through turns very smooth a

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:22.449 
would cut through turns very smooth a
lot<00:01:21.079> easier<00:01:21.229> to<00:01:21.409> ride<00:01:21.619> very<00:01:21.889> light<00:01:22.100> bike<00:01:22.340> on

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:22.459 
lot easier to ride very light bike on

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:25.209 
lot easier to ride very light bike on
the<00:01:22.490> r1<00:01:22.819> it's<00:01:22.999> more<00:01:23.119> of<00:01:23.209> a<00:01:23.270> workout<00:01:24.219> compared

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:25.219 
the r1 it's more of a workout compared

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:27.069 
the r1 it's more of a workout compared
to<00:01:25.249> that<00:01:25.340> I<00:01:25.459> also<00:01:25.639> have<00:01:25.850> no<00:01:25.969> 7000<00:01:26.569> double<00:01:26.749> r<00:01:26.899> and

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
to that I also have no 7000 double r and

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:28.749 
to that I also have no 7000 double r and
that's<00:01:27.709> just<00:01:27.829> an<00:01:27.979> all-around<00:01:28.130> smooth<00:01:28.549> bike

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
that's just an all-around smooth bike

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.870 
that's just an all-around smooth bike
gear<00:01:29.659> changes<00:01:30.109> coming<00:01:30.709> off<00:01:30.920> a<00:01:31.189> stop<00:01:31.850> just

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
gear changes coming off a stop just

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.179 
gear changes coming off a stop just
hydraulic<00:01:32.630> clutch<00:01:32.810> clutch<00:01:33.259> is<00:01:33.499> very<00:01:33.679> nice<00:01:33.859> but

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
hydraulic clutch clutch is very nice but

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.370 
hydraulic clutch clutch is very nice but
overall<00:01:34.850> I<00:01:34.969> think<00:01:35.179> the<00:01:35.539> AR<00:01:35.899> one<00:01:36.079> was<00:01:36.200> a<00:01:36.259> good

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
overall I think the AR one was a good

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.440 
overall I think the AR one was a good
choice<00:01:36.529> there's<00:01:36.950> only<00:01:37.100> a<00:01:37.159> couple<00:01:37.219> of<00:01:37.579> problems

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
choice there's only a couple of problems

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.800 
choice there's only a couple of problems
with<00:01:38.659> it<00:01:38.810> it<00:01:39.020> runs<00:01:39.229> too<00:01:39.380> hot<00:01:40.630> economy<00:01:41.630> fuel

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
with it it runs too hot economy fuel

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.959 
with it it runs too hot economy fuel
economy<00:01:42.139> sucks<00:01:42.409> but<00:01:43.189> like<00:01:43.249> that<00:01:43.459> bike<00:01:43.639> you

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
economy sucks but like that bike you

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:44.919 
economy sucks but like that bike you
don't<00:01:44.119> buy<00:01:44.209> a<00:01:44.240> bike<00:01:44.420> rack<00:01:44.539> that's<00:01:44.659> good

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
don't buy a bike rack that's good

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:47.379
