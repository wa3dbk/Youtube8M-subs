00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
that is natural as possible get back to

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.160 
that is natural as possible get back to
the<00:03:35.650> basics<00:03:35.860> so<00:03:36.400> this<00:03:37.060> is<00:03:37.270> not<00:03:37.420> rocket<00:03:37.630> science

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
it's just get back to basics if it
