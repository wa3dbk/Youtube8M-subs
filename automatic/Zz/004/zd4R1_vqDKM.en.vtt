up we'll put it on high first and then

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.310 
up we'll put it on high first and then
we'll<00:00:53.760> lower<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.750> doesn't<00:00:54.899> come<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.260> a

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.490 
we'll lower it so it doesn't come to a
boil<00:00:55.559> too<00:00:55.800> quickly<00:00:56.870> and<00:00:57.870> I'll<00:00:57.960> just<00:00:58.140> add<00:00:58.320> my

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
boil too quickly and I'll just add my

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.569 
boil too quickly and I'll just add my
sugar<00:00:59.690> to<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.870> milk<00:01:01.140> if<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:01.980> want<00:01:02.100> give<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.489> a

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
sugar to that milk if you want give it a

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.219 
sugar to that milk if you want give it a
nice<00:01:02.760> stir<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.570> doesn't<00:01:03.840> stick<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
nice stir so it doesn't stick to the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.290 
nice stir so it doesn't stick to the
bottom<00:01:04.410> now<00:01:05.369> always<00:01:05.610> when<00:01:05.970> you're<00:01:06.090> making

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
bottom now always when you're making

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
gives it a much more creamy texture and

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.969 
gives it a much more creamy texture and
it's<00:01:11.550> that<00:01:11.820> much<00:01:12.000> more<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.390> better<00:01:12.570> flavor

need<00:02:15.569> it<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.720> come<00:02:15.989> to<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.200> rolling<00:02:16.440> boil<00:02:16.799> just<00:02:17.130> a

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
need it to come to a rolling boil just a

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.640 
need it to come to a rolling boil just a
little<00:02:17.730> bit<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:17.970> bubble<00:02:18.269> on<00:02:18.390> top<00:02:18.630> you<00:02:19.260> see<00:02:19.500> the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
little bit of bubble on top you see the

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.800 
little bit of bubble on top you see the
smoke<00:02:19.950> coming<00:02:20.340> up<00:02:20.459> you<00:02:21.120> can<00:02:21.299> turn<00:02:21.569> that<00:02:21.750> off

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
smoke coming up you can turn that off

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.180 
smoke coming up you can turn that off
and<00:02:22.560> now<00:02:23.430> we're<00:02:23.850> going<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.150> slowly<00:02:24.930> add<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.860> to

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
and now we're going to slowly add it to

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.160 
and now we're going to slowly add it to
our<00:02:26.250> flour<00:02:26.340> mixture<00:02:29.180> now<00:02:30.180> just<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.660> little<00:02:31.019> bit

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
our flour mixture now just a little bit

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.009 
our flour mixture now just a little bit
at<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:31.380> time<00:02:31.549> you<00:02:32.549> add<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.760> little<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.480> then<00:02:33.870> you

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
at a time you add a little and then you

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.440 
at a time you add a little and then you
mix<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:34.410> together<00:02:34.590> until<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.819> becomes<00:02:35.910> smooth

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
mix it together until it becomes smooth

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.539 
mix it together until it becomes smooth
and<00:02:36.810> then<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.230> add<00:02:37.380> a<00:02:37.410> little<00:02:37.530> more<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.400> don't

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
and then you add a little more you don't

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.100 
and then you add a little more you don't
want<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.760> add<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.120> all<00:02:39.239> at<00:02:39.299> once<00:02:39.630> because<00:02:39.959> then

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
want to add it all at once because then

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.449 
want to add it all at once because then
I'll<00:02:40.200> become<00:02:40.470> really<00:02:40.859> lumpy<00:02:41.070> and<00:02:41.310> I'll<00:02:41.370> be

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
I'll become really lumpy and I'll be

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.150 
I'll become really lumpy and I'll be
hard<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:42.000> mix<00:02:42.530> so<00:02:43.530> now<00:02:43.680> just<00:02:43.920> add<00:02:44.130> the

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
hard to mix so now just add the

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.440 
hard to mix so now just add the
finishing<00:02:44.549> touches<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:46.440> rest<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.829> your<00:02:46.950> milk

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
finishing touches the rest of your milk

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.150 
finishing touches the rest of your milk
now<00:02:48.450> there's<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.720> lot<00:02:48.930> of<00:02:49.079> stirring<00:02:49.560> involved

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
now there's a lot of stirring involved

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.069 
now there's a lot of stirring involved
so<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:50.790> women<00:02:51.030> at<00:02:51.180> home<00:02:51.359> that<00:02:51.540> have<00:02:51.690> daughters

there's very minimal lumps in there the

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.370 
there's very minimal lumps in there the
blenders<00:03:26.890> going<00:03:27.070> to<00:03:27.160> get<00:03:27.250> that<00:03:27.430> all<00:03:27.610> out<00:03:28.380> you
