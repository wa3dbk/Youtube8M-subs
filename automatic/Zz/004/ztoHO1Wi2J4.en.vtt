let's say like a which sits on a wall
the<00:04:07.380> whole<00:04:07.530> time<00:04:07.769> but<00:04:07.950> if<00:04:08.040> she's<00:04:08.220> spawning

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
the whole time but if she's spawning

there was a pack of Larry's that were
left<00:04:31.340> live<00:04:31.670> that's<00:04:32.240> why<00:04:32.450> witches<00:04:32.840> are<00:04:32.960> so

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.490 
left live that's why witches are so
overpowered<00:04:35.000> he<00:04:35.270> brought<00:04:35.510> wall<00:04:35.840> breakers<00:04:36.320> the

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
overpowered he brought wall breakers the

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.470 
overpowered he brought wall breakers the
idea<00:04:36.890> for<00:04:37.040> the<00:04:37.130> wall<00:04:37.280> breakers<00:04:37.610> was<00:04:37.880> just<00:04:38.300> to

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
idea for the wall breakers was just to

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.470 
idea for the wall breakers was just to
blow<00:04:38.720> up<00:04:38.900> the<00:04:39.530> the<00:04:40.280> first<00:04:40.580> wall<00:04:40.880> just<00:04:41.180> to<00:04:41.300> get

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
blow up the the first wall just to get

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.330 
blow up the the first wall just to get
the<00:04:41.630> Pekka<00:04:42.020> right<00:04:42.350> in<00:04:42.500> the<00:04:42.620> middle<00:04:42.860> and<00:04:43.160> the

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.680 
the Pekka right in the middle and the
king<00:04:43.550> in<00:04:43.640> the<00:04:43.670> Queen<00:04:43.910> so<00:04:44.120> they<00:04:44.240> didn't<00:04:44.450> have<00:04:44.570> to

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
king in the Queen so they didn't have to

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.510 
king in the Queen so they didn't have to
bounce<00:04:44.870> out<00:04:45.140> and<00:04:45.380> around<00:04:45.590> but<00:04:46.130> it<00:04:46.220> ended<00:04:46.430> up

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
bounce out and around but it ended up

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.250 
bounce out and around but it ended up
working<00:04:46.700> out<00:04:46.940> for<00:04:47.150> the<00:04:47.210> best<00:04:47.390> part<00:04:47.690> this<00:04:48.080> was

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
working out for the best part this was

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.380 
working out for the best part this was
our<00:04:48.350> number<00:04:48.530> 11<00:04:49.070> guy<00:04:49.190> Tommy<00:04:49.550> attacking<00:04:50.240> their
