00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
there's none of that stuff and you can

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.350 
there's none of that stuff and you can
get<00:00:35.070> all<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.489> stuff<00:00:35.730> on<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.910> first<00:00:36.149> time

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
get all the stuff on the first time

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.190 
get all the stuff on the first time
around<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:37.100> yeah<00:00:38.809> also<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:39.840> have<00:00:40.260> 15,000<00:00:42.200> 674

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
around so yeah also I have 15,000 674

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.959 
around so yeah also I have 15,000 674
and<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.500> think<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.010> by<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.640> end<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.850> this

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
and I think that by the end of this

to<00:03:57.420> use<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.769> long<00:03:58.769> jump<00:03:59.040> but<00:03:59.190> it's<00:03:59.459> not

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
to use the long jump but it's not

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.150 
to use the long jump but it's not
working<00:04:00.079> all<00:04:01.079> right<00:04:01.349> and<00:04:01.500> i<00:04:01.769> think<00:04:01.799> i'm<00:04:02.069> going

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
working all right and i think i'm going

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.039 
working all right and i think i'm going
to<00:04:02.220> make<00:04:02.400> it<00:04:02.519> it's<00:04:02.670> really<00:04:03.150> it's<00:04:03.329> not<00:04:03.750> meant<00:04:03.959> to

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
to make it it's really it's not meant to

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.380 
to make it it's really it's not meant to
be<00:04:04.109> extremely<00:04:05.010> challenging<00:04:05.099> it's<00:04:06.060> just<00:04:06.239> meant

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
be extremely challenging it's just meant

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.390 
be extremely challenging it's just meant
to<00:04:06.420> be<00:04:06.510> challenging<00:04:06.959> like<00:04:07.379> that<00:04:08.040> if<00:04:08.250> you're

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
to be challenging like that if you're

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.690 
to be challenging like that if you're
dawdling<00:04:08.819> it<00:04:09.239> won't<00:04:09.480> work<00:04:10.069> so<00:04:11.069> you'll

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
dawdling it won't work so you'll

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.910 
dawdling it won't work so you'll
probably<00:04:11.819> make<00:04:12.150> it<00:04:12.209> and<00:04:12.480> as<00:04:13.349> you<00:04:13.500> sort<00:04:13.739> so<00:04:13.890> i

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
probably make it and as you sort so i

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.170 
probably make it and as you sort so i
didn't<00:04:14.220> actually<00:04:14.280> get<00:04:14.519> hit<00:04:14.579> there<00:04:14.879> even

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
didn't actually get hit there even

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.060 
didn't actually get hit there even
though<00:04:15.299> I<00:04:15.329> looks<00:04:16.260> like<00:04:16.410> I've<00:04:16.530> got<00:04:16.560> hit<00:04:16.829> about<00:04:17.039> a

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
though I looks like I've got hit about a

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.939 
though I looks like I've got hit about a
million<00:04:17.280> times<00:04:17.690> all<00:04:18.690> right<00:04:18.930> ambush<00:04:19.410> I<00:04:19.769> think

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:19.949 
million times all right ambush I think

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:23.210 
million times all right ambush I think
I'm<00:04:20.010> going<00:04:20.130> to<00:04:20.220> get<00:04:20.340> out<00:04:20.400> Seagram<00:04:21.919> some<00:04:22.919> reason

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
and we nearly have 20,000 volts so we

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.590 
and we nearly have 20,000 volts so we
can<00:04:51.450> nearly<00:04:51.750> by<00:04:53.060> not<00:04:54.060> sure<00:04:54.180> which<00:04:54.300> one's<00:04:54.510> worth

slims<00:06:14.080> wouldn't<00:06:14.350> cost<00:06:14.470> as<00:06:14.620> much<00:06:14.650> time<00:06:15.010> or

slims wouldn't cost as much time or
maybe<00:06:17.410> we<00:06:17.740> should<00:06:17.920> check<00:06:18.040> out<00:06:18.220> that<00:06:18.430> chemical

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850 
maybe we should check out that chemical

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.700 
maybe we should check out that chemical
factory<00:06:19.240> someone<00:06:19.900> inside<00:06:20.170> might<00:06:20.440> know<00:06:20.560> where

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
factory someone inside might know where

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.700 
factory someone inside might know where
the<00:06:20.800> thief<00:06:21.010> was<00:06:21.040> headed<00:06:21.490> okay<00:06:22.450> so<00:06:22.530> that's<00:06:23.530> not

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
the thief was headed okay so that's not

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.020 
the thief was headed okay so that's not
the<00:06:23.800> end<00:06:23.920> of<00:06:23.980> the<00:06:24.070> route<00:06:24.280> as<00:06:24.430> you<00:06:24.730> probably

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
the end of the route as you probably

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.760 
the end of the route as you probably
would<00:06:25.270> have<00:06:25.330> realized<00:06:25.740> that<00:06:27.060> is<00:06:28.060> for<00:06:28.840> to<00:06:29.650> get

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
would have realized that is for to get

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.050 
would have realized that is for to get
ship<00:06:29.950> upgrades<00:06:30.100> which<00:06:30.460> I've<00:06:30.610> been<00:06:30.730> talking

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
ship upgrades which I've been talking

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.400 
ship upgrades which I've been talking
about<00:06:31.120> the<00:06:31.480> coordinates<00:06:31.870> for<00:06:31.930> that<00:06:32.110> planet

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:32.410 
about the coordinates for that planet

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.350 
about the coordinates for that planet
and<00:06:32.560> that<00:06:32.800> plan<00:06:33.430> actually<00:06:33.670> has<00:06:33.910> nothing<00:06:34.210> on<00:06:34.300> it

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
and that plan actually has nothing on it

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.290 
and that plan actually has nothing on it
so<00:06:35.070> yeah<00:06:36.070> you<00:06:36.130> really<00:06:36.610> don't<00:06:36.850> have<00:06:36.940> to<00:06:37.030> walk<00:06:37.270> on

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300 
so yeah you really don't have to walk on

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.380 
so yeah you really don't have to walk on
worry<00:06:38.290> about<00:06:38.530> that<00:06:38.910> planet<00:06:39.910> at<00:06:40.000> the<00:06:40.060> moment

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:40.390 
worry about that planet at the moment

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.850 
worry about that planet at the moment
i'll<00:06:40.480> go<00:06:40.870> to<00:06:40.930> the<00:06:41.080> next<00:06:41.260> part<00:06:41.530> it's<00:06:41.710> going<00:06:41.830> to

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:51.730 
of after next one going to the chemical

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:56.270 
of after next one going to the chemical
factory<00:06:52.090> all<00:06:52.270> that<00:06:52.390> stuff<00:06:53.520> whoops<00:06:54.720> we're<00:06:55.720> way

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 
factory all that stuff whoops we're way

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:01.460 
factory all that stuff whoops we're way
yep<00:06:57.280> this<00:06:57.430> way<00:06:57.580> and<00:06:59.550> there<00:07:00.550> was<00:07:00.640> a<00:07:00.670> laser<00:07:00.910> beam

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:01.470 
yep this way and there was a laser beam

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.050 
yep this way and there was a laser beam
back<00:07:02.470> on<00:07:02.680> there<00:07:03.040> and<00:07:03.250> yeah<00:07:03.520> we<00:07:03.820> couldnt<00:07:04.000> get

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:04.060 
back on there and yeah we couldnt get

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.110 
back on there and yeah we couldnt get
through<00:07:04.300> and<00:07:04.540> we<00:07:05.350> still<00:07:05.620> can't<00:07:05.830> but<00:07:06.190> anyway<00:07:07.090> i

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.120 
through and we still can't but anyway i

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.700 
through and we still can't but anyway i
think<00:07:07.570> i<00:07:07.750> think<00:07:07.840> wants<00:07:08.140> to<00:07:08.200> go<00:07:08.290> back<00:07:08.440> to<00:07:08.500> this

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:08.710 
think i think wants to go back to this

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.070 
think i think wants to go back to this
planet<00:07:08.920> um<00:07:09.220> that<00:07:10.150> laser<00:07:10.390> beam<00:07:10.600> goes<00:07:10.810> away<00:07:10.930> so

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080 
planet um that laser beam goes away so

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.720 
planet um that laser beam goes away so
or<00:07:11.710> once<00:07:12.010> you've<00:07:12.130> done<00:07:12.250> this<00:07:12.400> mission<00:07:12.670> that

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:12.730 
or once you've done this mission that

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.230 
or once you've done this mission that
laser<00:07:12.910> beam<00:07:13.090> goes<00:07:13.270> away<00:07:13.420> at<00:07:13.570> least<00:07:14.970> she<00:07:15.970> you

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 
laser beam goes away at least she you

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.460 
laser beam goes away at least she you
don't<00:07:16.390> have<00:07:16.480> to<00:07:16.540> worry<00:07:16.690> about<00:07:16.780> that

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:17.470 
don't have to worry about that

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:26.180 
don't have to worry about that

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:40.600 
wait around bro there's only 25 hours of

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.020 
wait around bro there's only 25 hours of
the<00:07:40.660> sink<00:07:40.840> down<00:07:41.020> to<00:07:41.490> not<00:07:42.490> very<00:07:42.700> good<00:07:42.880> and<00:07:42.970> you

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:43.030 
the sink down to not very good and you

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:44.400 
the sink down to not very good and you
don't<00:07:43.210> always<00:07:43.330> receive<00:07:43.720> gun<00:07:43.930> over<00:07:44.140> because

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:44.410 
don't always receive gun over because

don't always receive gun over because
it's<00:07:44.590> very<00:07:44.980> hard<00:07:45.220> to<00:07:45.340> get<00:07:45.940> it<00:07:46.060> back<00:07:46.180> through

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:46.450 
it's very hard to get it back through

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:50.400 
it's very hard to get it back through
our<00:07:46.690> crates<00:07:47.940> anyway<00:07:48.940> I<00:07:48.970> use<00:07:49.810> this<00:07:49.930> bolt<00:07:50.170> crank

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:50.410 
our crates anyway I use this bolt crank

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:53.550 
our crates anyway I use this bolt crank
to<00:07:50.770> open<00:07:51.310> this<00:07:51.370> door<00:07:51.630> now<00:07:52.630> this<00:07:52.990> is<00:07:53.170> probably

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:53.560 
to open this door now this is probably

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.220 
to open this door now this is probably
the<00:07:53.740> most<00:07:53.980> annoying<00:07:54.610> thing<00:07:55.090> that<00:07:55.330> you<00:07:55.420> have<00:07:55.780> in

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:56.230 
the most annoying thing that you have in

00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:00.300 
the most annoying thing that you have in
the<00:07:56.290> game<00:07:56.470> or<00:07:56.650> at<00:07:56.710> least<00:07:56.860> I<00:07:56.980> think<00:07:57.790> it<00:07:57.910> is<00:07:59.310> for

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:00.310 
the game or at least I think it is for

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:03.750 
the game or at least I think it is for
now<00:08:00.370> and<00:08:00.760> for<00:08:01.300> now<00:08:01.390> I<00:08:01.420> me
