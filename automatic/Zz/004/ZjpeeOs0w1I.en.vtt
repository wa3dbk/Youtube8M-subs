00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.500 
it for me because first of all I
literally<00:05:35.889> cannot<00:05:36.400> sell<00:05:36.729> my<00:05:36.880> players<00:05:37.120> to<00:05:37.240> buy

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
literally cannot sell my players to buy

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.700 
literally cannot sell my players to buy
any<00:05:37.810> of<00:05:37.900> the<00:05:38.050> ones<00:05:38.200> that<00:05:38.289> they<00:05:38.440> are<00:05:38.560> still

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
any of the ones that they are still

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:39.900 
any of the ones that they are still
relative<00:05:39.070> for<00:05:39.220> that's<00:05:39.400> just<00:05:39.580> a<00:05:39.669> main

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
relative for that's just a main

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.180 
relative for that's just a main
ridiculous<00:05:40.479> point<00:05:40.720> but<00:05:40.960> also<00:05:41.080> you<00:05:41.770> haven't

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
ridiculous point but also you haven't

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.860 
ridiculous point but also you haven't
lowered<00:05:42.400> the<00:05:42.760> price<00:05:43.030> of<00:05:43.240> every<00:05:43.539> other<00:05:43.630> thing

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
lowered the price of every other thing

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.180 
lowered the price of every other thing
on<00:05:44.020> the<00:05:44.110> game<00:05:44.289> that<00:05:44.470> you<00:05:44.560> haven't<00:05:44.830> lowered<00:05:45.010> the

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
on the game that you haven't lowered the

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.830 
on the game that you haven't lowered the
price<00:05:45.370> of<00:05:45.550> packs<00:05:45.789> so<00:05:46.270> originally<00:05:46.510> when<00:05:46.810> I

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
price of packs so originally when I

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.870 
price of packs so originally when I
bought<00:05:47.050> that<00:05:47.110> nima<00:05:47.500> i<00:05:47.740> could<00:05:47.919> have<00:05:48.039> bought<00:05:48.160> 62

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
bought that nima i could have bought 62

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.029 
bought that nima i could have bought 62
packs<00:05:49.270> for<00:05:49.720> seven-and-a-half<00:05:50.200> k<00:05:50.590> with<00:05:50.800> that

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 
packs for seven-and-a-half k with that

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:53.040 
packs for seven-and-a-half k with that
now<00:05:51.610> if<00:05:51.970> i<00:05:52.090> could<00:05:52.150> actually<00:05:52.360> sell<00:05:52.750> them<00:05:52.870> for

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
now if i could actually sell them for

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.540 
now if i could actually sell them for
270<00:05:53.620> which<00:05:53.710> is<00:05:53.800> unlikely<00:05:54.099> but<00:05:54.280> let's<00:05:54.430> pretend

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
270 which is unlikely but let's pretend

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.850 
270 which is unlikely but let's pretend
i<00:05:54.849> could<00:05:55.000> sell<00:05:55.210> them<00:05:55.300> for<00:05:55.419> 270<00:05:56.110> k<00:05:56.229> if<00:05:56.590> i<00:05:56.680> went

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
i could sell them for 270 k if i went

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.939 
i could sell them for 270 k if i went
and<00:05:57.010> spent<00:05:57.160> on<00:05:57.310> 278<00:05:58.030> I<00:05:58.270> was<00:05:58.449> only<00:05:58.539> get<00:05:58.720> 36<00:05:59.620> pack

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949 
and spent on 278 I was only get 36 pack

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:02.700 
and spent on 278 I was only get 36 pack
so<00:06:00.130> it's<00:06:00.280> almost<00:06:00.460> half<00:06:01.360> it<00:06:01.660> is<00:06:01.780> ridiculous

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
so it's almost half it is ridiculous

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.680 
so it's almost half it is ridiculous
basically<00:06:03.669> I<00:06:03.820> don't<00:06:04.090> know<00:06:04.150> what<00:06:04.300> to<00:06:04.330> do<00:06:04.539> and<00:06:04.660> I

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
basically I don't know what to do and I

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.510 
basically I don't know what to do and I
dunno<00:06:04.840> if<00:06:04.930> it's<00:06:05.080> part<00:06:05.289> of<00:06:05.410> da's<00:06:05.800> master<00:06:06.310> plan

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
dunno if it's part of da's master plan

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.860 
dunno if it's part of da's master plan
to<00:06:06.550> get<00:06:06.789> loads<00:06:07.000> of<00:06:07.120> coins<00:06:07.330> out<00:06:07.510> to<00:06:07.630> the<00:06:07.720> game

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
to get loads of coins out to the game

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.270 
to get loads of coins out to the game
and<00:06:08.020> they're<00:06:08.139> just<00:06:08.530> everyone<00:06:09.010> up<00:06:09.160> I

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 
and they're just everyone up I

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.800 
and they're just everyone up I
don't<00:06:09.340> really<00:06:09.669> know<00:06:09.880> what<00:06:10.150> is<00:06:10.270> going<00:06:10.300> on<00:06:10.660> at

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
don't really know what is going on at

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.230 
don't really know what is going on at
all<00:06:10.990> but<00:06:11.370> hopefully<00:06:12.370> it<00:06:12.460> works<00:06:12.520> out<00:06:12.789> I<00:06:12.849> can't

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
all but hopefully it works out I can't

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.580 
all but hopefully it works out I can't
see<00:06:13.449> you<00:06:13.510> working<00:06:13.810> out<00:06:13.960> and<00:06:14.199> basically

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
see you working out and basically

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.560 
see you working out and basically
they've<00:06:14.860> just<00:06:15.010> screwed<00:06:15.430> over<00:06:15.669> mostly<00:06:16.449> the

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
they've just screwed over mostly the

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.000 
they've just screwed over mostly the
loyal<00:06:16.780> people<00:06:17.050> who<00:06:17.320> have<00:06:17.470> carried<00:06:17.770> on<00:06:17.889> playing

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
loyal people who have carried on playing

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.830 
loyal people who have carried on playing
this<00:06:18.280> game<00:06:18.460> while<00:06:19.000> it<00:06:19.090> was<00:06:19.210> absolutely

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
this game while it was absolutely

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.860 
this game while it was absolutely
and<00:06:20.400> basically<00:06:21.400> price<00:06:21.970> band<00:06:22.270> changes<00:06:22.720> have

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
and basically price band changes have

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.629 
and basically price band changes have
become<00:06:23.169> overnight<00:06:23.650> one<00:06:24.220> of<00:06:24.310> the<00:06:24.430> most

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 
become overnight one of the most

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:28.740 
become overnight one of the most
annoying<00:06:25.060> things<00:06:25.419> on<00:06:25.690> FIFA<00:06:26.650> 15<00:06:27.240> so<00:06:28.240> they<00:06:28.330> don't
