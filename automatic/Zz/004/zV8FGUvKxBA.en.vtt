needed now another thing you'll notice
is<00:00:33.960> on<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.380> left<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.890> right<00:00:34.950> side<00:00:35.309> are

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
is on the left and the right side are

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.200 
is on the left and the right side are
LEDs<00:00:37.710> there<00:00:38.100> are<00:00:38.190> actually<00:00:38.460> three<00:00:38.850> in<00:00:39.090> each

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
LEDs there are actually three in each

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.150 
LEDs there are actually three in each
one<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.750> I'll<00:00:39.930> show<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.530> second

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
so when you turn on your DS they start

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:54.049 
so when you turn on your DS they start
out<00:00:46.320> blue<00:00:52.100> you<00:00:53.100> can<00:00:53.370> have<00:00:53.489> them<00:00:53.640> set<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.000> a

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
out blue you can have them set to a

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.450 
out blue you can have them set to a
specific<00:00:54.270> color<00:00:54.690> I've<00:00:55.199> set<00:00:55.530> them<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:56.629> and

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
specific color I've set them to this and

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.930 
specific color I've set them to this and
here<00:00:59.460> i<00:00:59.609> have<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.059> firmware<00:01:01.579> first<00:01:02.579> on<00:01:02.850> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
here i have the firmware first on the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.120 
here i have the firmware first on the
left<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.449> games<00:01:03.750> or<00:01:04.110> applications

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
and here's my music and then you have

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.649 
and here's my music and then you have
the<00:01:42.399> options<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.970> options<00:01:46.000> are<00:01:46.390> actually

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
the options the options are actually

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.090 
the options the options are actually
really<00:01:46.840> nice<00:01:46.990> on<00:01:47.110> this<00:01:47.259> there<00:01:47.560> is<00:01:47.649> instant

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
really nice on this there is instant

single game when you try on your DS
it'll<00:01:54.340> automatically<00:01:54.819> boot<00:01:55.000> straight<00:01:55.300> to

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
it'll automatically boot straight to

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.870 
it'll automatically boot straight to
that<00:01:55.450> game<00:01:55.750> unless<00:01:56.020> you<00:01:56.080> hold<00:01:56.289> the<00:01:56.409> letter<00:01:56.590> A

that game unless you hold the letter A
there's<00:01:57.880> also<00:01:58.090> dancing<00:01:58.659> LEDs<00:01:59.080> which<00:01:59.649> I'll

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
there's also dancing LEDs which I'll

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.700 
there's also dancing LEDs which I'll
show<00:01:59.950> you<00:02:00.509> basically<00:02:01.509> as<00:02:01.780> you<00:02:02.200> can<00:02:02.350> see<00:02:02.500> my

show you basically as you can see my

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.340 
show you basically as you can see my
leds<00:02:03.190> are<00:02:03.310> this<00:02:03.459> color<00:02:03.700> right<00:02:03.940> now<00:02:04.350> however

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
leds are this color right now however

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.100 
leds are this color right now however
turning<00:02:05.709> on<00:02:05.830> dancing<00:02:06.490> LEDs<00:02:07.060> and<00:02:09.660> then<00:02:10.660> playing

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
turning on dancing LEDs and then playing

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.160 
turning on dancing LEDs and then playing
music<00:02:13.830> normally<00:02:14.830> make<00:02:14.980> some<00:02:15.130> change<00:02:15.370> color<00:02:15.700> I

music normally make some change color I
think<00:02:17.170> I<00:02:17.260> have<00:02:17.350> to<00:02:17.500> turn<00:02:18.130> on<00:02:18.280> my<00:02:18.310> D<00:02:18.519> s<00:02:18.760> again

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.420 

well<00:02:23.230> while<00:02:23.680> it's<00:02:23.799> doing<00:02:23.890> that<00:02:24.100> I'll<00:02:24.190> explain

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
well while it's doing that I'll explain

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.720 
well while it's doing that I'll explain
some<00:02:24.609> other<00:02:24.700> stuff<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:28.600> dsx<00:02:29.250> in<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.340> options

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
some other stuff the dsx in the options

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.580 
some other stuff the dsx in the options
menu<00:02:30.790> you<00:02:31.180> can<00:02:31.209> change<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:32.109> brightness<00:02:32.290> of

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
menu you can change the brightness of

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.640 
menu you can change the brightness of
each<00:02:32.739> LED<00:02:33.750> here<00:02:34.750> I'll<00:02:34.900> show<00:02:34.930> you<00:02:35.109> the<00:02:35.260> dancing

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
each LED here I'll show you the dancing

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.580 
each LED here I'll show you the dancing
LEDs<00:02:39.750> one<00:02:40.750> thing<00:02:40.930> you'll<00:02:41.049> notice<00:02:41.200> is<00:02:41.440> the

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
LEDs one thing you'll notice is the

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:49.490 
LEDs one thing you'll notice is the
firmware<00:02:41.769> actually<00:02:42.280> moves<00:02:42.489> rather<00:02:42.730> slow

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.020 

the<00:02:50.500> form<00:02:50.710> where<00:02:50.830> is<00:02:50.950> very<00:02:51.100> smooth<00:02:51.490> but<00:02:51.760> it's<00:02:51.910> a

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
the form where is very smooth but it's a

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:59.010 
the form where is very smooth but it's a
bit<00:02:52.270> slow<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.540> react<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:57.010> then<00:02:57.580> we<00:02:57.730> have<00:02:58.020> the

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
bit slow to react and then we have the

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.900 
bit slow to react and then we have the
default<00:02:59.650> skin<00:03:00.010> so<00:03:00.280> you<00:03:00.370> can<00:03:00.490> change<00:03:00.730> which

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
default skin so you can change which

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
time flash cartridge at one time and

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.370 
time flash cartridge at one time and
then<00:03:09.130> here<00:03:09.430> you<00:03:10.150> can<00:03:10.300> change<00:03:10.600> how<00:03:10.810> bright<00:03:11.110> each

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
each one so if i increase the green on

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.620 
each one so if i increase the green on
one<00:03:20.050> of<00:03:20.110> the<00:03:20.170> leds<00:03:24.330> you<00:03:25.330> see<00:03:25.480> you're<00:03:25.570> getting

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
one of the leds you see you're getting

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.170 
one of the leds you see you're getting
progressively<00:03:25.960> greener<00:03:26.620> and<00:03:30.030> right<00:03:31.030> now

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
progressively greener and right now

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.350 
progressively greener and right now
earlier<00:03:31.600> they<00:03:31.810> were<00:03:31.840> at<00:03:32.050> 10<00:03:32.500> out<00:03:32.740> of<00:03:32.910> 255<00:03:33.910> like

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
earlier they were at 10 out of 255 like

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.330 
earlier they were at 10 out of 255 like
the<00:03:35.140> power<00:03:35.550> so<00:03:36.550> these<00:03:36.910> get<00:03:37.090> really<00:03:37.390> bright<00:03:38.340> and
