00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
a little longer to start releasing but

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.650 
a little longer to start releasing but
that<00:02:31.160> was<00:02:31.340> just<00:02:31.700> because<00:02:31.880> we<00:02:32.210> started<00:02:32.600> from

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660

adopted out on an animal exactly every
30<00:02:38.120> seconds<00:02:38.690> okay<00:02:38.920> now<00:02:39.920> which<00:02:40.460> shelter<00:02:40.910> has

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
30 seconds okay now which shelter has

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.950 
30 seconds okay now which shelter has
more<00:02:41.420> animals<00:02:42.880> so<00:02:43.880> even<00:02:44.330> though<00:02:44.480> everything

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
more animals so even though everything

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.900

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
else stayed the same they ended up with

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.570 
else stayed the same they ended up with
more<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:47.390> manage<00:02:47.750> at<00:02:47.930> shelter<00:02:48.290> B<00:02:48.470> yep<00:02:49.160> because
