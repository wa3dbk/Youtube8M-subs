00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.039 
do a leak down test on a 95 players SL
750<00:00:09.349> we<00:00:10.349> rebuilt<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.950> engine<00:00:10.980> recently<00:00:12.049> put

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
750 we rebuilt the engine recently put

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.690 
750 we rebuilt the engine recently put
it<00:00:13.139> back<00:00:13.290> in<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:13.769> everybody<00:00:14.160> I'm<00:00:14.280> talking<00:00:14.639> to

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
you is telling me you need to do a leak

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.800 
you is telling me you need to do a leak
down<00:00:16.470> test<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:17.699> make<00:00:17.820> sure<00:00:17.880> you've<00:00:18.240> got<00:00:18.449> the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
down test to make sure you've got the

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.599 
down test to make sure you've got the
engine<00:00:19.109> seal<00:00:19.350> good<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.250> know<00:00:20.340> all<00:00:20.490> that

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
engine seal good and you know all that

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:21.349 
engine seal good and you know all that
kind<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.910> good<00:00:21.060> stuff

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
kind of good stuff

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.769 
kind of good stuff
so<00:00:22.109> we're<00:00:22.380> performing<00:00:22.769> one<00:00:23.510> basically<00:00:24.510> what

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
so we're performing one basically what

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.490 
so we're performing one basically what
you<00:00:24.900> need<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.230> do<00:00:25.609> is<00:00:26.609> remove<00:00:27.289> the<00:00:28.289> upper

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
you need to do is remove the upper

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.290 
you need to do is remove the upper
exhaust<00:00:29.429> manifold

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
exhaust manifold

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.310 
exhaust manifold
okay<00:00:30.800> then<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:31.920> take<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> tennis<00:00:32.399> ball<00:00:33.050> and<00:00:34.050> cut

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
okay then you take a tennis ball and cut

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.310 
okay then you take a tennis ball and cut
it<00:00:34.880> basically<00:00:35.880> in<00:00:36.090> half<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.570> turn<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.870> inside

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
it basically in half and turn it inside

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.310 
it basically in half and turn it inside
out<00:00:38.120> it's<00:00:39.120> not<00:00:39.210> going<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.450> be<00:00:39.510> exactly<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.140> half

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
out it's not going to be exactly in half

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.049 
out it's not going to be exactly in half
you're<00:00:40.620> going<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.829> want<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.100> little<00:00:41.219> bit<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.760> the

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
you're going to want a little bit of the

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.779 
you're going to want a little bit of the
bigger<00:00:42.270> section<00:00:43.160> that's<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.340> part<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.579> went

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
bigger section that's the part that went

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.000 
bigger section that's the part that went
inside<00:00:45.120> but<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.360> turn<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.660> inside<00:00:45.989> out<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.469> it's

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
inside but I turn it inside out and it's

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.250 
inside but I turn it inside out and it's
rubber<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.969> inside<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.930> then<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.110> can

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
rubber on the inside so and then you can

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.170 
rubber on the inside so and then you can
force<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:49.920> just<00:00:50.250> push<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.640> force<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.090> in

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
force it in just push it in force it in

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.360 
force it in just push it in force it in
the<00:00:51.390> rubber<00:00:51.600> creates<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.559> good<00:00:52.739> section<00:00:53.190> or

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
the rubber creates a good section or

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.790 
the rubber creates a good section or
seal<00:00:53.699> for<00:00:54.180> your<00:00:54.210> exhaust<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:55.350> I'm<00:00:55.440> take<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
seal for your exhaust so I'm take the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.010 
seal for your exhaust so I'm take the
exhaust<00:00:56.070> off<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.550> do<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.850> then<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.840> want<00:00:57.989> to

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
exhaust off and do that then you want to

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.229 
exhaust off and do that then you want to
take<00:00:58.170> your<00:00:58.289> carburetors<00:00:58.920> off<00:00:59.129> okay<00:00:59.910> now<00:01:00.180> I

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
take your carburetors off okay now I

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.830 
take your carburetors off okay now I
picked<00:01:00.539> up<00:01:00.690> these<00:01:00.870> rubber<00:01:02.000> plugs<00:01:03.000> at<00:01:03.390> Ace

apiece and they're just angled plugs I
actually<00:01:10.110> took<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.680> intake<00:01:11.100> manifold<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.939> had

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
actually took the intake manifold I had

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.620 
actually took the intake manifold I had
an<00:01:12.210> extra<00:01:12.540> one<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.869> believe<00:01:13.500> these<00:01:13.710> are<00:01:13.770> one<00:01:14.130> and

an extra one I believe these are one and
thirteen<00:01:15.630> sixteenths<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.680> size<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.159> them

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
thirteen sixteenths is the size of them

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.810 
thirteen sixteenths is the size of them
and<00:01:19.049> there<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.439> Ace<00:01:19.799> Hardware<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.640> says

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
and there it is Ace Hardware it says

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.730 
and there it is Ace Hardware it says

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
give them a nice snug and the rubber

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.069 
give them a nice snug and the rubber
gives<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.490> good<00:01:32.610> seal<00:01:32.939> then<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.840> take<00:01:34.049> your

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
gives it a good seal then you take your

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.140 
gives it a good seal then you take your
pulse<00:01:34.470> line<00:01:34.829> for<00:01:35.250> your<00:01:35.340> fuel<00:01:35.579> pump

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
pulse line for your fuel pump

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.999 
pulse line for your fuel pump
this<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.079> pulse<00:01:37.259> line<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.799> would<00:01:37.890> go

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
this is the pulse line that would go

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.550 
this is the pulse line that would go
underneath<00:01:38.340> on<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.479> engine<00:01:39.810> here<00:01:40.110> that's

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
underneath on the engine here that's

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.370 
underneath on the engine here that's
your<00:01:40.740> fuel<00:01:41.490> pump<00:01:41.670> pulse<00:01:41.939> line<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:43.020> take<00:01:43.170> that

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
your fuel pump pulse line you take that

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.289 
your fuel pump pulse line you take that
off<00:01:43.500> your<00:01:43.649> fuel<00:01:43.890> pump<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.850> hook<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.270> a

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
off your fuel pump and you hook it to a

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.749 
off your fuel pump and you hook it to a
vacuum<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:47.210> pump<00:01:48.799> basically<00:01:49.799> pick<00:01:50.579> these<00:01:50.700> up

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
vacuum on pump basically pick these up

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.359 
vacuum on pump basically pick these up

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
Green Hulk net I believe what they said

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.380 
Green Hulk net I believe what they said
was<00:02:34.430> to<00:02:34.730> set<00:02:35.209> it<00:02:35.330> to<00:02:35.360> nine<00:02:35.720> pounds<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:37.390> it

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
was to set it to nine pounds and it

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.009 
was to set it to nine pounds and it
should<00:02:38.630> hold<00:02:38.750> for<00:02:38.989> at<00:02:39.079> least<00:02:39.200> 10<00:02:39.500> minutes<00:02:41.019> and

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
should hold for at least 10 minutes and

should hold for at least 10 minutes and
that's<00:02:42.290> all<00:02:42.709> you<00:02:42.829> need<00:02:42.980> as<00:02:43.220> you<00:02:43.280> can<00:02:43.489> see<00:02:43.640> my

that's all you need as you can see my
gauge<00:02:44.060> is<00:02:44.269> not<00:02:44.299> moving<00:02:44.750> or<00:02:45.280> slowly<00:02:46.280> going<00:02:46.579> down

none and all I've done is I've put three

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:31.800 
none and all I've done is I've put three
and<00:03:24.319> these<00:03:24.500> plugs<00:03:24.829> in<00:03:25.190> all<00:03:25.609> my<00:03:27.130> car<00:03:28.130> airports

that's all there is to it I still got
nine<00:03:35.640> look<00:03:36.640> at<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:38.490> so<00:03:39.490> that's<00:03:40.390> how<00:03:40.840> you<00:03:40.900> do<00:03:41.080> a

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
nine look at the so that's how you do a

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.200 
nine look at the so that's how you do a
leak<00:03:41.290> down<00:03:41.500> check<00:03:41.830> somebody<00:03:42.250> was<00:03:42.520> asking<00:03:42.700> you

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 
leak down check somebody was asking you

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.660 
leak down check somebody was asking you
know<00:03:43.360> how<00:03:43.510> long<00:03:43.690> does<00:03:43.810> it<00:03:43.870> take<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.320> pump<00:03:44.670> pump

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
know how long does it take the pump pump

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.270 
know how long does it take the pump pump
the<00:03:45.880> gauge<00:03:46.530> if<00:03:47.530> you're<00:03:47.980> sitting<00:03:48.160> there

the gauge if you're sitting there
pumping<00:03:48.670> pumping<00:03:48.820> pumping<00:03:49.150> and<00:03:49.510> you're<00:03:49.600> not

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
pumping pumping pumping and you're not

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.540 
pumping pumping pumping and you're not
getting<00:03:50.080> anything<00:03:50.290> is<00:03:50.770> you<00:03:51.010> probably<00:03:51.190> got<00:03:51.520> one

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
getting anything is you probably got one

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.449 
getting anything is you probably got one
of<00:03:51.880> these<00:03:52.000> here<00:03:52.300> leaking<00:03:52.840> either<00:03:53.770> the<00:03:53.890> ball<00:03:54.100> or

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
of these here leaking either the ball or

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.960 
of these here leaking either the ball or
one<00:03:54.640> of<00:03:54.790> these<00:03:56.310> otherwise<00:03:57.310> you<00:03:57.520> got<00:03:57.700> a<00:03:57.730> leak

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
one of these otherwise you got a leak

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.090 
one of these otherwise you got a leak
and<00:03:58.270> then<00:03:58.510> in<00:03:58.750> that<00:03:58.930> case<00:03:59.170> if<00:03:59.410> you<00:03:59.530> do<00:03:59.680> find<00:03:59.890> out

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
and then in that case if you do find out

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.920 
and then in that case if you do find out
you<00:04:00.220> have<00:04:00.310> a<00:04:00.370> leak<00:04:00.610> instead<00:04:01.060> of<00:04:01.150> using<00:04:01.330> a<00:04:01.570> pump

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
you have a leak instead of using a pump

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.810 
you have a leak instead of using a pump
to<00:04:02.560> pump<00:04:02.770> you're<00:04:02.980> going<00:04:03.130> to<00:04:03.190> want<00:04:03.340> to<00:04:03.400> put<00:04:03.580> air

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
to pump you're going to want to put air

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.690 
to pump you're going to want to put air
and<00:04:04.300> what<00:04:04.870> I<00:04:04.900> did<00:04:05.260> when<00:04:06.100> I<00:04:06.190> first<00:04:06.459> started

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
and what I did when I first started

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.610 
and what I did when I first started
doing<00:04:06.850> this<00:04:07.000> I<00:04:07.270> had<00:04:07.480> these<00:04:07.959> were<00:04:08.140> leak<00:04:08.350> and<00:04:08.560> I

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
doing this I had these were leak and I

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.800 
doing this I had these were leak and I
was<00:04:08.739> trying<00:04:09.040> a<00:04:09.130> different<00:04:09.160> idea<00:04:09.910> I<00:04:10.150> was<00:04:10.630> using

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
was trying a different idea I was using

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.220 
was trying a different idea I was using
a<00:04:11.050> rubber<00:04:11.320> ball<00:04:11.670> I'll<00:04:12.670> show<00:04:12.910> you<00:04:12.970> I<00:04:13.420> was<00:04:14.050> using

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
a rubber ball I'll show you I was using

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.870 
a rubber ball I'll show you I was using
one<00:04:14.500> of<00:04:14.530> these<00:04:14.709> rubber<00:04:14.920> balls<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:15.550> it<00:04:15.640> sat<00:04:15.850> in

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
one of these rubber balls and it sat in

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.190 
one of these rubber balls and it sat in
the<00:04:16.000> hole<00:04:16.180> but<00:04:16.390> I<00:04:16.419> just<00:04:16.600> couldn't<00:04:16.810> get<00:04:16.959> enough

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
the hole but I just couldn't get enough

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.349 
the hole but I just couldn't get enough
pressure<00:04:17.470> on<00:04:17.829> it<00:04:17.980> to<00:04:18.010> hold<00:04:18.310> it<00:04:18.489> down

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
pressure on it to hold it down

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.890 
pressure on it to hold it down
and<00:04:20.350> it<00:04:20.440> was<00:04:20.560> leaking<00:04:20.950> from<00:04:21.130> it<00:04:21.340> so<00:04:22.000> when<00:04:22.870> I

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
and it was leaking from it so when I

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.390 
and it was leaking from it so when I
started<00:04:23.290> looking<00:04:23.500> to<00:04:23.800> figure<00:04:23.950> out<00:04:24.130> where<00:04:24.280> the

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
started looking to figure out where the

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.550 
started looking to figure out where the
leak<00:04:24.520> was<00:04:24.760> I<00:04:24.910> put<00:04:25.150> air<00:04:25.330> into<00:04:25.840> the<00:04:26.110> pulse<00:04:26.320> line

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
leak was I put air into the pulse line

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.380 
leak was I put air into the pulse line
and<00:04:26.890> what<00:04:27.010> you<00:04:27.100> do<00:04:27.250> is<00:04:27.370> set<00:04:27.640> it<00:04:27.760> down<00:04:27.790> to<00:04:28.270> about

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
and what you do is set it down to about

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.540 
and what you do is set it down to about
ten<00:04:28.720> pounds<00:04:28.930> on<00:04:29.260> your<00:04:29.440> regulator<00:04:29.919> on<00:04:30.190> your<00:04:30.340> air

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
ten pounds on your regulator on your air

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.830 
ten pounds on your regulator on your air
compressor<00:04:31.210> and<00:04:31.330> then<00:04:31.900> push<00:04:32.140> air<00:04:32.350> in<00:04:32.560> and<00:04:33.840> when

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
compressor and then push air in and when

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.710 
compressor and then push air in and when
I<00:04:34.870> started<00:04:35.320> pushing<00:04:35.650> down<00:04:35.800> on<00:04:35.950> those<00:04:36.130> balls

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
I started pushing down on those balls

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.780 
I started pushing down on those balls
then<00:04:37.720> all<00:04:38.110> of<00:04:38.140> a<00:04:38.229> sudden<00:04:38.260> this<00:04:38.650> thing<00:04:38.790> popped

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
then all of a sudden this thing popped

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.420 
then all of a sudden this thing popped
out<00:04:40.120> it<00:04:40.390> came<00:04:40.720> flying<00:04:40.960> out<00:04:41.320> so<00:04:42.070> I<00:04:42.100> knew<00:04:42.280> that

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
out it came flying out so I knew that

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.890 
out it came flying out so I knew that
that<00:04:42.520> had<00:04:42.790> a<00:04:42.820> good<00:04:43.000> seal<00:04:43.240> because<00:04:43.510> it<00:04:43.630> went

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
that had a good seal because it went

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.040 
that had a good seal because it went
boom<00:04:44.200> and<00:04:44.650> popped<00:04:45.060> it<00:04:46.060> will<00:04:46.510> just<00:04:46.690> with<00:04:46.870> ten

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
boom and popped it will just with ten

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.170 
boom and popped it will just with ten
the<00:04:47.320> ten<00:04:47.530> pounds<00:04:48.010> and<00:04:48.250> so<00:04:48.640> I<00:04:48.669> ran<00:04:48.970> and<00:04:49.120> got

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
the ten pounds and so I ran and got

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.909 
the ten pounds and so I ran and got
these<00:04:49.419> at<00:04:49.600> Ace<00:04:49.720> Hardware<00:04:50.050> and<00:04:50.380> they're

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
these at Ace Hardware and they're

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.980 
these at Ace Hardware and they're
working<00:04:51.250> good<00:04:51.370> I'm<00:04:51.940> still<00:04:52.240> nine<00:04:52.479> pounds

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
working good I'm still nine pounds

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.200 
working good I'm still nine pounds
through<00:04:53.169> this<00:04:53.290> whole<00:04:53.500> video<00:04:53.820> hasn't<00:04:54.820> moved<00:04:54.970> an

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
through this whole video hasn't moved an

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.409 
through this whole video hasn't moved an
inch<00:04:55.330> so<00:04:56.310> looks<00:04:57.310> like<00:04:57.400> I<00:04:57.669> got<00:04:57.850> the<00:04:57.880> seventh

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
inch so looks like I got the seventh

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.170 
inch so looks like I got the seventh
seal<00:04:58.600> good<00:04:59.400> but<00:05:00.400> the<00:05:00.520> reason<00:05:00.880> I<00:05:00.970> was<00:05:01.150> doing

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
seal good but the reason I was doing

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.600 
seal good but the reason I was doing
this<00:05:01.660> leak<00:05:01.960> was<00:05:02.200> I<00:05:02.320> did<00:05:02.500> a<00:05:02.530> piston<00:05:03.070> wash<00:05:03.280> and

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
this leak was I did a piston wash and

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.310 
this leak was I did a piston wash and
the<00:05:03.669> piston<00:05:04.000> wash<00:05:04.150> look<00:05:04.419> good<00:05:04.690> and<00:05:04.900> all<00:05:04.990> three

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
the piston wash look good and all three

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.969 
the piston wash look good and all three
cylinders<00:05:06.300> but<00:05:07.300> I'm<00:05:07.479> having<00:05:07.990> a<00:05:08.080> problem<00:05:08.560> when

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
cylinders but I'm having a problem when

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:14.969 
cylinders but I'm having a problem when
I<00:05:10.080> stop<00:05:11.080> and<00:05:11.500> then<00:05:12.040> go<00:05:12.070> to<00:05:12.250> re-accelerate<00:05:13.979> it's

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
I stop and then go to re-accelerate it's

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:18.060 
I stop and then go to re-accelerate it's
acting<00:05:15.520> up<00:05:15.669> it<00:05:15.880> was<00:05:16.090> running<00:05:16.479> great<00:05:16.860> the<00:05:17.860> last

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
acting up it was running great the last

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.500 
acting up it was running great the last
three<00:05:18.340> or<00:05:18.430> four<00:05:18.460> trips<00:05:18.790> I've<00:05:19.030> had<00:05:19.180> out<00:05:19.330> and

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
three or four trips I've had out and

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.960 
three or four trips I've had out and
then<00:05:19.630> just<00:05:19.930> this<00:05:20.080> last<00:05:20.320> trip<00:05:20.740> I<00:05:20.979> had<00:05:21.640> pulled

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
then just this last trip I had pulled

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.880 
then just this last trip I had pulled
the<00:05:22.060> carburetors<00:05:22.630> off<00:05:22.780> and<00:05:23.050> rejected<00:05:23.710> them

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
the carburetors off and rejected them

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.280 
the carburetors off and rejected them
took<00:05:24.669> it<00:05:24.850> out<00:05:25.000> and<00:05:25.030> it<00:05:25.360> was<00:05:25.450> running<00:05:25.780> great<00:05:25.960> and

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
took it out and it was running great and

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.540 
took it out and it was running great and
then<00:05:26.410> just<00:05:26.680> towards<00:05:27.010> the<00:05:27.070> end<00:05:27.130> of<00:05:27.280> the<00:05:27.370> day

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
then just towards the end of the day

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.960 
then just towards the end of the day
after<00:05:27.850> about<00:05:28.030> a<00:05:28.060> two-hour<00:05:28.419> ride<00:05:28.890> I<00:05:29.970> stopped

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
after about a two-hour ride I stopped

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.730 
after about a two-hour ride I stopped
and<00:05:31.210> I<00:05:31.300> went<00:05:31.510> to<00:05:31.600> reaccelerating<00:05:32.260> didn't<00:05:32.590> want

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
and I went to reaccelerating didn't want

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.400 
and I went to reaccelerating didn't want
to<00:05:32.830> re-accelerate<00:05:33.250> I<00:05:33.790> pulled<00:05:34.450> this<00:05:34.570> PT<00:05:35.020> over

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
to re-accelerate I pulled this PT over

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.610 
to re-accelerate I pulled this PT over
plug<00:05:36.070> and<00:05:36.460> it<00:05:36.760> looked<00:05:37.120> a<00:05:37.240> little<00:05:37.360> bit<00:05:37.570> foul<00:05:38.820> and

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
plug and it looked a little bit foul and

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.950 
plug and it looked a little bit foul and
there<00:05:41.620> was<00:05:41.770> acting<00:05:42.130> just<00:05:42.160> strange<00:05:42.700> so<00:05:43.060> we<00:05:43.720> did

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
there was acting just strange so we did

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.560 
there was acting just strange so we did
some<00:05:44.680> readjustments<00:05:45.460> on<00:05:45.580> the<00:05:45.729> engine<00:05:46.150> took<00:05:46.419> it

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
some readjustments on the engine took it

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.700 
some readjustments on the engine took it
back<00:05:46.720> out<00:05:46.960> and<00:05:47.610> played<00:05:48.610> with<00:05:48.820> the<00:05:49.710> mixture

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
back out and played with the mixture

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.290 
back out and played with the mixture
controlling<00:05:51.250> the<00:05:51.340> carburetors<00:05:51.849> and<00:05:51.880> I<00:05:52.120> got

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
controlling the carburetors and I got

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.390 
controlling the carburetors and I got
the<00:05:52.450> plug<00:05:52.630> readings<00:05:53.050> to<00:05:53.349> all<00:05:53.500> look<00:05:53.770> good<00:05:54.070> but<00:05:54.370> I

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
the plug readings to all look good but I

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.730 
the plug readings to all look good but I
was<00:05:54.640> still<00:05:54.940> having<00:05:55.180> a<00:05:55.450> problem<00:05:55.500> with<00:05:56.500> it<00:05:56.620> out

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
was still having a problem with it out

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.150 
was still having a problem with it out
of<00:05:56.770> the<00:05:56.950> hole<00:05:57.190> it's<00:05:57.880> a<00:05:58.030> severe<00:05:58.479> severe<00:05:59.020> bog<00:05:59.800> I

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
of the hole it's a severe severe bog I

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.850 
of the hole it's a severe severe bog I
actually<00:06:00.400> have<00:06:00.849> to<00:06:01.090> play<00:06:01.960> with<00:06:02.229> the<00:06:02.349> gas<00:06:02.560> just

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
actually have to play with the gas just

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.150 
actually have to play with the gas just
to<00:06:03.010> get<00:06:03.190> it<00:06:03.310> going<00:06:03.520> and<00:06:04.590> so<00:06:05.590> I<00:06:05.620> just<00:06:05.890> wanted<00:06:06.099> to

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160

vent on the fuel tank and that's all
checking<00:06:23.020> out<00:06:23.169> good<00:06:23.380> and<00:06:23.650> I<00:06:23.680> got<00:06:23.860> the<00:06:23.979> mikuni
