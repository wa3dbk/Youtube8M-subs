00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.550
 Y 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.710
 that a friend brings microfÃºtbol today 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.500
 I bring you to review what is the blog 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.110
 launcher has just released beta 5 but 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.759
 I remember more but good, hoping that 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.310
 leave the official launcher blog 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.500
 to start the developers of 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.780
 mod to do something much better is good 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.070
 this more than anything is for version 0.9 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.620
 since I have put we did not have 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.710
 the blog launcher for this version in the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.840
 which then simply the only thing 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.690
 that will serve us I think it is to install 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.200
 textures that is from here we're going to put 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.200
 this Yes 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.210
 from here and enabling the skin what 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.430
 are the ways as you see I have supposed 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.559
 that one is not installed but it does not appear 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.399
 I do not know why so I think that's a 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.199
 mistake of the game but then still for 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.060
 now we only have what is textures and 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.830
 skill and we're going to have to wait for 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.570
 keep testing what is the blog 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.979
 launcher but a little state in it 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.840
 they also like the texture that 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.149
 I'm using because it's not molds is 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.619
 texture then be left in the 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:19.960
 description so they can download it 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.090

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.960
