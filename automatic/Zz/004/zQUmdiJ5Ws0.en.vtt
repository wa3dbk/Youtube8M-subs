00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.980 

concave<00:02:10.640> really<00:02:11.640> really<00:02:12.150> nice

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
concave really really nice

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.780 
concave really really nice
I<00:02:13.020> am<00:02:13.200> so<00:02:13.500> concave<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.490> a<00:02:14.760> board<00:02:15.090> like<00:02:15.300> this

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
I am so concave of a board like this

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.120 
I am so concave of a board like this
since<00:02:17.790> my<00:02:18.300> first<00:02:18.870> board<00:02:19.230> which<00:02:19.410> is<00:02:19.560> my<00:02:19.740> element

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
since my first board which is my element

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.310 
since my first board which is my element
which<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.550> guys<00:02:20.760> are<00:02:20.970> seen<00:02:21.150> my<00:02:22.050> creature

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
which you guys are seen my creature

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.520 
which you guys are seen my creature
didn't<00:02:22.680> have<00:02:26.390> concave<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.690> would<00:02:28.170> give<00:02:28.380> this

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
didn't have concave I would give this

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.610 
didn't have concave I would give this
board<00:02:28.800> an<00:02:29.160> 8

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
board an 8

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.980 
board an 8
the<00:02:31.620> reason<00:02:31.950> I'm<00:02:32.040> not<00:02:32.070> giving<00:02:32.490> it<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.700> 10<00:02:32.990> is

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
the reason I'm not giving it a 10 is

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.380 
the reason I'm not giving it a 10 is
because<00:02:34.380> there's<00:02:35.010> probably<00:02:35.970> too<00:02:36.240> much

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
because there's probably too much

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.990 
because there's probably too much
concave<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.260> feels<00:02:37.500> like<00:02:37.740> your<00:02:38.640> foots

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
concave and it feels like your foots

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.400 
concave and it feels like your foots
like<00:02:39.210> this<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.870> feels<00:02:40.050> like<00:02:40.230> you're

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
like this and it feels like you're

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.730 
like this and it feels like you're
standing<00:02:40.590> on<00:02:40.830> something<00:02:41.130> like<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:42.140> so<00:02:43.140> that

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
standing on something like that so that

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:50.000 
standing on something like that so that
takes<00:02:43.920> point<00:02:44.250> off<00:02:44.400> two<00:02:45.180> points<00:02:45.450> off<00:02:49.010> texture

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
takes point off two points off texture

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.110 
takes point off two points off texture
of<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.280> board<00:02:50.520> it's<00:02:51.030> blank<00:02:51.500> so<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.530> mean<00:02:52.910> that<00:02:53.910> I

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
of the board it's blank so I mean that I

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.570 
of the board it's blank so I mean that I
like<00:02:54.390> that<00:02:54.690> cuz<00:02:55.320> I<00:02:55.530> mean<00:02:55.710> you're<00:02:56.100> gonna<00:02:56.280> grind

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580
