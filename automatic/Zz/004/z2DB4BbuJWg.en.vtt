00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
different colors we're going to use the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.970 
different colors we're going to use the
milk<00:00:58.829> glass<00:00:59.100> today<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.809> use<00:01:01.050> these<00:01:01.469> with

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
milk glass today and you use these with

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.000 
milk glass today and you use these with
a<00:01:02.219> high-temperature<00:01:02.850> glue<00:01:03.239> gun<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:04.010> these

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
a high-temperature glue gun and these

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.100 
a high-temperature glue gun and these
molds<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.060> can<00:01:06.270> actually<00:01:06.450> make<00:01:06.930> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
molds and you can actually make the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.660 
molds and you can actually make the
shape<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.010> want<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.220> make<00:01:08.340> sure<00:01:08.369> that

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
shape so you want to make sure that

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.250 
shape so you want to make sure that
you're<00:01:08.790> using<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:09.270> high<00:01:09.450> temp<00:01:09.720> glue<00:01:09.900> gun<00:01:10.080> with

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
you're using a high temp glue gun with

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.210 
you're using a high temp glue gun with
these<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.619> says<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:10.920> right<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.100> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
these it says so right on the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.219 
these it says so right on the
instructions<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.450> tested<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.960> with<00:01:13.049> my

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
instructions and I tested it with my

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.660 
instructions and I tested it with my
regular<00:01:13.380> glue<00:01:13.770> gun<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.340> high<00:01:14.460> temp

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
regular glue gun and the high temp

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.789 
regular glue gun and the high temp
definitely<00:01:15.060> works<00:01:15.240> better<00:01:15.560> so<00:01:16.560> what<00:01:16.710> you're

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
definitely works better so what you're

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
any of those types of things and again

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.500 
any of those types of things and again
you<00:02:30.489> want<00:02:30.579> to<00:02:30.670> make<00:02:30.819> sure<00:02:30.849> that<00:02:31.090> it's<00:02:31.239> really

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
you want to make sure that it's really

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.449 
you want to make sure that it's really
really<00:02:31.870> hot<00:02:32.049> we've<00:02:32.379> got<00:02:32.590> this<00:02:32.739> second<00:02:33.159> stick

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
really hot we've got this second stick

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.490 
really hot we've got this second stick
here<00:02:33.700> from<00:02:33.879> the<00:02:34.000> back<00:02:34.150> that<00:02:34.750> isn't<00:02:35.109> as<00:02:35.200> hot<00:02:35.349> as

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
here from the back that isn't as hot as

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.640 
here from the back that isn't as hot as
the<00:02:35.620> first<00:02:35.919> so<00:02:36.639> it<00:02:36.790> can<00:02:37.480> be<00:02:37.689> a<00:02:37.930> little<00:02:38.409> bit<00:02:38.560> of

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
the first so it can be a little bit of

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.989 
the first so it can be a little bit of
effort<00:02:38.769> to<00:02:38.950> get<00:02:39.189> that<00:02:39.310> in<00:02:39.519> but<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:39.760> just<00:02:39.849> want

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:39.999 
effort to get that in but you just want

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:42.959 
effort to get that in but you just want
to<00:02:40.060> make<00:02:40.180> sure<00:02:40.209> it's<00:02:40.419> extremely<00:02:40.989> hot<00:02:41.849> and<00:02:42.849> so

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:42.969 
to make sure it's extremely hot and so

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:46.530 
to make sure it's extremely hot and so
you're<00:02:43.090> gonna<00:02:43.180> fill<00:02:43.510> your<00:02:43.659> shape<00:02:43.959> here<00:02:44.379> and<00:02:45.540> it

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
you're gonna fill your shape here and it

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.879 
you're gonna fill your shape here and it
just<00:02:46.719> takes<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:47.049> minute<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.379> you<00:02:47.500> kind<00:02:47.680> of<00:02:47.709> want

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:47.889 
just takes a minute and you kind of want

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:49.379 
just takes a minute and you kind of want

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:49.389 
to get all the way around again you

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:50.879 
to get all the way around again you
don't<00:02:49.510> have<00:02:49.629> to<00:02:49.870> worry<00:02:50.019> about<00:02:50.139> air<00:02:50.349> bubbles<00:02:50.739> or

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:50.889

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
any of those types of things and then I

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.949 
any of those types of things and then I
just<00:02:53.349> tap<00:02:53.620> mine<00:02:53.949> out<00:02:54.129> like<00:02:54.909> this<00:02:55.120> so<00:02:55.719> we'll<00:02:55.810> do

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
just tap mine out like this so we'll do

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.670 
just tap mine out like this so we'll do
one<00:02:55.989> of<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.290> smaller<00:02:56.560> ones<00:02:56.799> up<00:02:56.980> here<00:02:57.010> to<00:02:58.680> fill

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
one of the smaller ones up here to fill

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.399 
one of the smaller ones up here to fill
that<00:02:59.859> guy<00:03:00.069> up<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.579> you're<00:03:01.419> just<00:03:01.449> squeezing<00:03:02.260> it
