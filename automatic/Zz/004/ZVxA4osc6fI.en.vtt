00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.869 
is a strange force this is boreal forest
that<00:03:23.959> has<00:03:24.019> had<00:03:24.560> fire<00:03:24.920> suppression<00:03:25.609> it<00:03:25.700> was

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
that has had fire suppression it was

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.569 
that has had fire suppression it was
logged<00:03:26.500> it<00:03:27.500> was<00:03:27.620> horse<00:03:27.859> logged<00:03:28.129> in<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.430> old

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
logged it was horse logged in the old

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.250 
logged it was horse logged in the old
days<00:03:28.790> which<00:03:29.060> leaves<00:03:29.299> a<00:03:29.450> lot<00:03:29.569> of<00:03:29.720> shade<00:03:29.989> and

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
days which leaves a lot of shade and

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.490 
days which leaves a lot of shade and
balsam<00:03:30.680> fir<00:03:31.480> comes<00:03:32.480> in<00:03:32.659> thick<00:03:32.959> and<00:03:33.230> then

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
balsam fir comes in thick and then

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.000 
balsam fir comes in thick and then
triggers<00:03:34.010> budworm<00:03:34.459> cycles<00:03:34.970> and<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:36.650> budworm

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
triggers budworm cycles and the budworm

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.420 
triggers budworm cycles and the budworm
kills<00:03:37.280> off<00:03:37.549> a<00:03:37.909> huge<00:03:38.510> part<00:03:38.810> of<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.220> balsam<00:03:40.220> fir

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
kills off a huge part of the balsam fir

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.679 
kills off a huge part of the balsam fir
and<00:03:40.489> it<00:03:40.609> dies<00:03:40.760> when<00:03:41.030> its<00:03:41.150> young<00:03:41.209> and<00:03:41.359> it<00:03:41.540> just

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:41.689 
and it dies when its young and it just

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:43.119 
and it dies when its young and it just
blows<00:03:41.959> down<00:03:42.230> it<00:03:42.470> almost<00:03:42.650> looks<00:03:42.889> like<00:03:43.010> that's

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
blows down it almost looks like that's

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.250 
blows down it almost looks like that's
cutting<00:03:43.489> stack<00:03:43.790> but<00:03:44.060> that's<00:03:44.209> just<00:03:44.480> that's

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
cutting stack but that's just that's

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.979 
cutting stack but that's just that's
just<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:45.650> way<00:03:45.739> it<00:03:45.829> is<00:03:45.920> and<00:03:46.189> then<00:03:46.810> balsam<00:03:47.810> fir

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
just the way it is and then balsam fir

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.780 
just the way it is and then balsam fir
grows<00:03:48.290> up<00:03:48.500> again<00:03:48.769> not<00:03:48.980> all<00:03:49.159> of<00:03:49.310> it<00:03:49.400> gets<00:03:49.579> killed

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
grows up again not all of it gets killed

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.789 
grows up again not all of it gets killed
and<00:03:50.090> you'll<00:03:50.389> repeat<00:03:50.689> the<00:03:50.840> cycle<00:03:51.019> what<00:03:51.620> will

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
and you'll repeat the cycle what will

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.429 
and you'll repeat the cycle what will
break<00:03:52.010> this<00:03:52.220> cycle<00:03:52.489> is<00:03:52.849> big<00:03:53.599> hot<00:03:53.810> forest<00:03:54.230> fires

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:54.439 
break this cycle is big hot forest fires

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:57.280 
break this cycle is big hot forest fires
where<00:03:54.739> these<00:03:54.859> spruce<00:03:55.310> here<00:03:55.659> will<00:03:56.659> reproduce

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
where these spruce here will reproduce

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.759 
where these spruce here will reproduce
and<00:03:57.709> the<00:03:58.519> birch<00:03:58.730> will<00:03:59.079> reproduce<00:04:00.079> as<00:04:00.349> well<00:04:00.530> but

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
and the birch will reproduce as well but

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.699 
and the birch will reproduce as well but
the<00:04:00.889> fur<00:04:01.340> will<00:04:01.489> get<00:04:01.639> knocked<00:04:01.849> back<00:04:01.970> for<00:04:02.709> many

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
the fur will get knocked back for many

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.170 
the fur will get knocked back for many
many<00:04:03.859> decades<00:04:04.099> but<00:04:04.489> right<00:04:04.669> now<00:04:04.819> it's<00:04:05.000> a<00:04:05.060> no

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
many decades but right now it's a no

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.830 
many decades but right now it's a no
balsam<00:04:05.540> fir<00:04:05.750> budworm<00:04:06.169> cycle<00:04:06.620> and<00:04:06.769> it's<00:04:07.220> just

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
balsam fir budworm cycle and it's just

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.309 
balsam fir budworm cycle and it's just
unlimited<00:04:09.579> firewood<00:04:10.599> which<00:04:11.599> isn't<00:04:11.900> bad<00:04:11.930> for

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
unlimited firewood which isn't bad for

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.490 
unlimited firewood which isn't bad for
camping<00:04:13.159> but<00:04:13.819> the<00:04:14.269> bush<00:04:14.480> is<00:04:14.690> virtually

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
camping but the bush is virtually

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.640 
camping but the bush is virtually

impossible to to crash through you need

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.399 
impossible to to crash through you need
a<00:04:18.680> trail<00:04:18.949> to<00:04:19.280> hike<00:04:20.209> this<00:04:20.389> this<00:04:20.989> part<00:04:21.260> of<00:04:21.349> the

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
boreal forest here it's just a mess so

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:34.010 
boreal forest here it's just a mess so
back<00:04:26.630> to<00:04:26.659> finishing<00:04:27.250> breakfast<00:04:28.250> here
