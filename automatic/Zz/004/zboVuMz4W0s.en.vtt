00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.370 
ends okay so that's the end of episode 1
and<00:04:15.780> um<00:04:17.880> it's<00:04:18.880> it's<00:04:19.150> hard<00:04:19.510> to<00:04:19.630> judge<00:04:19.810> a<00:04:19.840> show<00:04:20.109> by

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
and um it's it's hard to judge a show by

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.550 
and um it's it's hard to judge a show by
one<00:04:20.590> episode<00:04:21.039> because<00:04:22.020> you<00:04:23.020> just<00:04:23.199> kind<00:04:23.470> of

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
one episode because you just kind of

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.110 
one episode because you just kind of
barely<00:04:23.949> get<00:04:24.190> a<00:04:24.220> feel<00:04:24.460> for<00:04:24.760> it<00:04:24.789> and<00:04:24.880> all<00:04:25.000> the

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
barely get a feel for it and all the

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.450 
barely get a feel for it and all the
characters<00:04:25.510> are<00:04:25.600> being<00:04:25.810> introduced<00:04:26.200> and<00:04:26.500> but

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
characters are being introduced and but

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.370 
characters are being introduced and but
i<00:04:27.610> think<00:04:27.910> that<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.210> show<00:04:28.419> did<00:04:29.139> a<00:04:29.200> good<00:04:29.320> job

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
i think that the show did a good job

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.590 
i think that the show did a good job
