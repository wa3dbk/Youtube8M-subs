00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.880 

color<00:00:05.279> is<00:00:05.430> important<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:05.939> me<00:00:06.089> and<00:00:06.419> I<00:00:07.319> think

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
color is important to me and I think

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.009 
color is important to me and I think
color<00:00:08.130> can<00:00:08.670> have<00:00:08.849> meaning<00:00:09.299> or<00:00:09.450> color<00:00:09.690> rather

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
color can have meaning or color rather

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.839 
color can have meaning or color rather
can<00:00:10.290> be<00:00:10.410> invested<00:00:10.889> with<00:00:11.040> meaning<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.519> think<00:00:11.730> we

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
can be invested with meaning I think we

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.759 
can be invested with meaning I think we
as<00:00:12.000> humans<00:00:12.360> invested<00:00:12.900> color<00:00:13.169> with<00:00:13.379> meaning

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
as humans invested color with meaning

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.760 
as humans invested color with meaning
and<00:00:14.389> nonetheless<00:00:15.389> we<00:00:15.870> can't<00:00:16.170> invest<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.650> with

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
and nonetheless we can't invest it with

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.890 
and nonetheless we can't invest it with
meaning<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.220> therefore<00:00:17.760> color<00:00:18.180> can<00:00:18.690> be

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
meaning and therefore color can be

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.890 
meaning and therefore color can be
important<00:00:19.440> and<00:00:19.620> can<00:00:19.800> be<00:00:19.950> a<00:00:19.980> storytelling<00:00:20.520> tool

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
important and can be a storytelling tool

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.230 
important and can be a storytelling tool
that<00:00:21.900> we<00:00:22.080> can<00:00:22.290> use<00:00:22.830> we<00:00:23.790> can<00:00:23.820> avail<00:00:24.210> ourselves

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:27.159 
think correlated to las hermanas the

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:29.610 
think correlated to las hermanas the
chicken<00:03:27.700> place<00:03:28.150> that<00:03:28.359> he<00:03:28.510> owns<00:03:28.629> and<00:03:28.930> it<00:03:29.500> was

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
chicken place that he owns and it was

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.199

one<00:03:29.739> of<00:03:29.829> the<00:03:29.890> colors<00:03:30.159> we<00:03:30.310> were<00:03:30.430> using<00:03:30.909> that

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
one of the colors we were using that

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.000
