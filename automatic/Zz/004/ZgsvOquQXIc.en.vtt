 this video is not for 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.150
 Marseille since it is addressed 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.750
 especially to a psg fan between 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.090
 parentheses 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.950
 ie the paris saint germain is 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.410
 certainly but it shines listen to me 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.640
 criticized the words wto when you have 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.890
 the star on the heart you believe by 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.960
 did you learn anything else to 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.730
 criticize but you will make the path of 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.130

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.330

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.140
 he's going to eat you he 'll see you again 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.520
 urban wasteland and as my friend says 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.690
 greg on the Greek fan page preventing 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.219
 excuse me Greek I make you a little bit of 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.460
 pub 1 since you make a lot of videos 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.719
 do not make a human hand for you 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.059
 greg he is not wrong what says that haiti 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.550
 myths about videos stop you from 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.410
 chicane is constantly the day that you 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.230
 will bring back the champions league the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.460
 presumed captain with his shovel paris you 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.030
 will be able to speak but we are here we are 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.980
 will say nothing 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.510
 but you deserved something 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.000
 the national anthem is the Marseillaise 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.980
 why the call for the Parisian 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.190
 high because is because paris 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.049
 it's tragic it's even magical time 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.400
 to the ten cities of a beer I was 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.950
 to say something else it's shitty city 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.840
 I am clear with you after the 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.430
 film dedication to Jeremy must never 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.729
 first once again passed my 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.130
 post by cons on a small board 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.090
 friend stops criticizing the om because 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.250
 soon when you see that in marseille 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.650
 for lebron maccione clasico we're going to 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.030
 burst and and at least you can tell 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.950
 well you four check what you 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.450
 fight him but in my opinion what you 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.820
 have never tamured past to tell him 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.869
 so here's a little parenthesis I'm doing a 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.680
 kiss to all the fans and I respect 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.930
 Verry much 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.070
 all the Marseillais but that the 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.390
 Parisians can not understand 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.770
 his Basques ah yes but the difference 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.040
 is that an interview between marseille and 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.020
 Paris 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.530
 is that in Marseille we have the sea 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.450
 you have the scene okay after you 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.829
 have the princes' park we it's 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.020
 we have the biggest stadium in France 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.250
 who wish velodrome after the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.759
 Stade de France which does not belong to 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.840
 psg 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.920
 esneu qatar in large against a small 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.860
 message to the players of the Olympic 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.540
 marseille have I do not criticize but what 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.870
 that I see is that some have had 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.310
 place by the jersey 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.979
 this is not the fault of sir 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.290
 marcello bielsa what a super tactician to 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.040
 share his choice to play andrÃ© ayew 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.840
 Lateral that I will not understand but 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.100
 brest 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.600
 I think should not push the 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.570
 players must be still lived up to 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.510
 the end there are four matches left which 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:29.510
 means we can take 12 points 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.850
 and if I advise you friends tomorrow 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.380

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.920
 the olympique de marseille knows that 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.120
 Parisians allow themselves to call 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:47.330

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.380
