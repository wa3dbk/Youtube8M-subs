design-wise it's like it's a 3d model of
the<00:01:23.700> animated<00:01:24.180> costume<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.259> that's<00:01:25.500> why<00:01:25.710> what

the animated costume so that's why what

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.440 
the animated costume so that's why what
I'm<00:01:26.040> looking<00:01:26.400> at<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:26.700> costume<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.360> I'm

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
I'm looking at this costume and I'm

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.120 
I'm looking at this costume and I'm
looking<00:01:27.689> at<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.869> way<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.049> looks<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.530> how<00:01:28.979> his

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
looking at the way it looks and how his

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.940 
looking at the way it looks and how his
face<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.670> just<00:01:29.939> it's<00:01:30.710> proportioned<00:01:31.710> very

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
face is just it's proportioned very

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.940 
face is just it's proportioned very
weird<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.759> not<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:33.689> human-like<00:01:34.170> but<00:01:34.799> that's

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
weird and not so human-like but that's

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.920 
weird and not so human-like but that's
probably<00:01:35.250> because<00:01:35.939> they<00:01:36.180> are<00:01:36.210> literally

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
probably because they are literally

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.950 
probably because they are literally
ripping<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.829> animate<00:01:38.340> Batman<00:01:38.850> look<00:01:39.630> and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
ripping the animate Batman look and

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.920 
ripping the animate Batman look and
turning<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.040> into<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.369> 3d<00:01:41.970> model<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.810> if

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
turning it into a 3d model so if

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.170 
turning it into a 3d model so if
anything<00:01:43.200> looks<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.649> little<00:01:43.770> odd<00:01:44.130> or<00:01:44.460> out<00:01:44.520> of

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
anything looks a little odd or out of

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.380 
anything looks a little odd or out of
shape<00:01:45.210> or<00:01:45.899> not<00:01:45.930> like<00:01:46.770> Batman<00:01:47.579> in<00:01:47.880> his<00:01:47.939> like

not irregular you know that we've seen
this<00:02:07.770> before<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.190> with<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.090> said<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.539> looks

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
this before so with that said it looks

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.419 
this before so with that said it looks
really

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
really

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.430 
really
I'm<00:02:10.610> liking<00:02:10.849> the<00:02:11.090> design<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.959> face<00:02:12.170> again

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
I'm liking the design the face again

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.619

looks<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.430> little<00:02:13.610> bit<00:02:13.849> weird<00:02:14.090> but<00:02:14.299> that's<00:02:14.390> just

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
looks a little bit weird but that's just

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.390 
looks a little bit weird but that's just
probably<00:02:14.810> because<00:02:15.319> I'm<00:02:15.799> guessing<00:02:16.220> it's<00:02:16.340> a

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
probably because I'm guessing it's a

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.770 
probably because I'm guessing it's a
manga<00:02:16.790> that<00:02:16.970> it's<00:02:17.209> coming<00:02:17.420> from<00:02:17.540> just

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
manga that it's coming from just

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.440

designed<00:02:18.319> it<00:02:18.470> that<00:02:18.500> way<00:02:18.909> but<00:02:19.909> besides<00:02:20.330> that

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
designed it that way but besides that

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.780 
designed it that way but besides that
the<00:02:20.690> costume<00:02:21.110> itself<00:02:21.440> is<00:02:21.560> really<00:02:21.799> cool<00:02:22.069> I<00:02:22.310> like
