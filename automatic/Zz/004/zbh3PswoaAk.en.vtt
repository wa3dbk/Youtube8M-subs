you will design the five panels kind of

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.240 
you will design the five panels kind of
the<00:00:50.100> columns<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.180> document<00:00:52.170> here<00:00:52.440> you'll

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
the columns of this document here you'll

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.779 
the columns of this document here you'll
also<00:00:53.960> use<00:00:54.960> Photoshop<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.890> create<00:00:56.340> any<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
also use Photoshop to create any of the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.310 
also use Photoshop to create any of the
graphic<00:00:57.210> elements<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.809> you'd<00:00:57.960> like

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
so perhaps graphic images on your cover

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.700 
so perhaps graphic images on your cover
or<00:01:01.980> your<00:01:02.129> back<00:01:02.309> cover<00:01:02.870> definitely<00:01:03.870> your

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
or your back cover definitely your

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.210 
or your back cover definitely your
author<00:01:04.920> bio<00:01:05.339> page<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.409> perhaps<00:01:07.409> create<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> mask

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
author bio page so perhaps create a mask

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.520 
author bio page so perhaps create a mask
or<00:01:08.549> something<00:01:08.820> around<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.299> photograph<00:01:09.960> that

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
or something around the photograph that

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.000 
or something around the photograph that
