00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
starts with C so let's press spacebar go

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.849 
starts with C so let's press spacebar go
to<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.220> brushes<00:00:23.580> palette<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.230> that<00:00:25.230> displays

to the brushes palette and that displays
all<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.099> brushes<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.789> are<00:00:26.939> available

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
all the brushes that are available

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.060 
all the brushes that are available
within<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:29.880> window<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.420> then<00:00:30.929> curve<00:00:31.710> quad

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
within this window and then curve quad

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.500 
within this window and then curve quad
fill<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.550> C<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.149> then<00:00:33.960> Q<00:00:35.090> curve<00:00:36.090> quad<00:00:36.300> okay

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
fill so C and then Q curve quad okay

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.600 
fill so C and then Q curve quad okay
that<00:00:36.690> gives<00:00:36.989> us<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.440> brush<00:00:37.710> curve<00:00:38.129> quad<00:00:38.399> fill

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
that gives us that brush curve quad fill

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.160 
that gives us that brush curve quad fill
and<00:00:38.850> then<00:00:40.640> then<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.879> have<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.210> be<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.930> have<00:00:43.140> to

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
and then then you have to be you have to

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.619 
and then then you have to be you have to
start<00:00:43.559> your<00:00:45.980> mesh<00:00:46.980> or<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.940> have<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.180> click<00:00:48.450> on

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
start your mesh or you have to click on

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.580 
start your mesh or you have to click on
your<00:00:49.579> whatever<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.730> have<00:00:51.170> to<00:00:52.789> start<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.590> quad

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
your whatever you have to start the quad

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.189 
your whatever you have to start the quad
fill<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.600> know<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.719> could<00:00:58.050> rotate

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
fill so you you know you could rotate

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.290 
fill so you you know you could rotate
and<00:00:58.559> stuff<00:00:58.770> but<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.730> wouldn't<00:00:59.969> really<00:01:00.059> get

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
and stuff but that wouldn't really get

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:08.050 
and stuff but that wouldn't really get
you<00:01:00.390> anything<00:01:01.579> so<00:01:02.579> if<00:01:03.170> we<00:01:04.729> pull<00:01:05.729> out<00:01:05.939> an<00:01:06.470> arm

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
you anything so if we pull out an arm

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.910 
you anything so if we pull out an arm
let's<00:01:09.060> make<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.240> really<00:01:09.570> bumpy<00:01:10.530> right<00:01:10.710> there

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
let's make it really bumpy right there

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.260 
let's make it really bumpy right there
and<00:01:11.130> then<00:01:11.640> let<00:01:12.030> go<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:13.110> gives<00:01:13.350> us<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:13.799> shape

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
and then let go that gives us this shape

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.760 
and then let go that gives us this shape
that<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:16.939> little<00:01:17.939> strange<00:01:18.170> but<00:01:19.170> then<00:01:19.409> we<00:01:19.590> can

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
that is a little strange but then we can

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.960 
that is a little strange but then we can
go<00:01:19.920> with<00:01:20.100> inside<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.990> you<00:01:21.990> notice<00:01:22.290> how<00:01:22.439> the
