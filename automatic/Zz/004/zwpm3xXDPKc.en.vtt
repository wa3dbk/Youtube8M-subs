00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
a little bit lighter and I'm going to

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.850 
a little bit lighter and I'm going to
use<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.940> bone<00:02:54.300> meal<00:02:54.510> so<00:02:55.380> I'll<00:02:55.500> put<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.710> bone

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
you like so I keep doing this all day

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.699 
you like so I keep doing this all day
but<00:03:31.560> it's<00:03:31.980> pretty<00:03:32.310> pretty<00:03:32.670> fairly<00:03:33.180> easy<00:03:33.360> so

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
but it's pretty pretty fairly easy so

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.610 
but it's pretty pretty fairly easy so
let's<00:03:34.709> pick<00:03:34.950> another<00:03:34.980> color<00:03:35.459> um<00:03:35.760> I<00:03:36.350> would<00:03:37.350> use

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
let's pick another color um I would use

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.410 
let's pick another color um I would use
since<00:03:37.830> my<00:03:38.010> cup<00:03:38.250> my<00:03:38.280> character<00:03:38.790> is<00:03:38.910> green<00:03:39.180> I

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
since my cup my character is green I

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.810 
since my cup my character is green I
would<00:03:39.480> probably<00:03:39.750> use<00:03:40.050> a<00:03:40.560> lime<00:03:41.160> green<00:03:41.190> so<00:03:41.670> let's

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
would probably use a lime green so let's

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.180 
would probably use a lime green so let's
go<00:03:41.910> ahead<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.209> try<00:03:42.360> lime<00:03:42.570> green<00:03:42.950> so<00:03:43.950> yeah<00:03:44.100> it

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
go ahead and try lime green so yeah it

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.949 
go ahead and try lime green so yeah it
looks<00:03:44.370> like<00:03:44.459> a<00:03:44.519> pretty<00:03:44.700> good<00:03:44.850> color<00:03:45.030> now<00:03:45.720> if<00:03:45.870> I

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
looks like a pretty good color now if I

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.199 
looks like a pretty good color now if I
didn't<00:03:46.200> like<00:03:46.380> that<00:03:46.590> color<00:03:46.800> I<00:03:47.100> could<00:03:47.850> probably

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
didn't like that color I could probably

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.080 
didn't like that color I could probably
do<00:03:48.720> I<00:03:49.320> could<00:03:50.280> probably<00:03:50.430> put<00:03:50.640> some<00:03:50.760> white<00:03:50.940> in

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
do I could probably put some white in

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.990 
do I could probably put some white in
there<00:03:51.269> make<00:03:51.450> it<00:03:51.570> a<00:03:51.600> little<00:03:51.750> lighter<00:03:52.519> yeah<00:03:53.519> so

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
you got to get the idea it's pretty

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.890 
you got to get the idea it's pretty
pretty<00:03:56.190> easy<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:56.730> let's<00:03:57.360> go<00:03:57.510> ahead<00:03:57.570> and<00:03:57.750> show
