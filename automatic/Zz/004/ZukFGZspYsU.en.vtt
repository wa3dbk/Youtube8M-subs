00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.740

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.650
 best possible the text since it was in 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.170
 English and maybe when the 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.840
 subclasses if so may vary something 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.900

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.990

 grenades that do not harm the enemy but 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.150

 the ground that cause little harm if 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.880
 alone but together can kill a 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.670
 guardians are difficult to appreciate in the 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.709
 ground 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.599
 How can you appreciate these classes? 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.160
 they are more practical than the rest only 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.690
 it remains that these rumors are true and 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160
 we can expand our repertoire of 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.800
 strategies when dealing with 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.300
 assaults and raids but it seems 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.709
 be that my hunter is going to have the class 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.150
 more troll was something that I like 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.010
