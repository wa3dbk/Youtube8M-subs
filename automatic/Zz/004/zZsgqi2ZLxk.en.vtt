I<00:02:07.799> think<00:02:07.979> he<00:02:08.280> could<00:02:08.459> be<00:02:08.489> decent<00:02:09.030> but<00:02:09.239> he<00:02:09.629> may<00:02:10.080> be

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
I think he could be decent but he may be

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.260 
I think he could be decent but he may be
pretty<00:02:10.500> hard<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.860> fit<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.160> team<00:02:11.400> because<00:02:11.550> I'm

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
pretty hard to fit a team because I'm

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.250 
pretty hard to fit a team because I'm
not<00:02:12.450> sure<00:02:12.660> how<00:02:12.900> many

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
not sure how many

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.229 
not sure how many
bosnian<00:02:13.680> players<00:02:13.920> are<00:02:14.099> but<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:14.909> links

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
bosnian players are but that that links

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.360 
bosnian players are but that that links
pretty<00:02:15.569> unlikely<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.439> polish<00:02:16.830> lee<00:02:16.950> they<00:02:17.099> last

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
pretty unlikely the polish lee they last

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.280 
pretty unlikely the polish lee they last
year<00:02:17.610> had<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.760> very<00:02:18.000> solid<00:02:18.299> team<00:02:18.659> so<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:18.900> could

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
year had a very solid team so that could

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.899 
year had a very solid team so that could
potentially<00:02:19.620> be<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.069> route<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.459> go<00:02:20.579> down<00:02:20.760> if

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
potentially be the route to go down if

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.490 
potentially be the route to go down if
you<00:02:21.030> use<00:02:21.150> this<00:02:21.269> guy<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.930> I'm<00:02:22.110> seven<00:02:22.409> then

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
you use this guy and I'm seven then

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.170 
you use this guy and I'm seven then
we've<00:02:22.650> got<00:02:22.709> a<00:02:22.860> player<00:02:23.129> will<00:02:23.310> be<00:02:23.400> superb<00:02:23.939> for
