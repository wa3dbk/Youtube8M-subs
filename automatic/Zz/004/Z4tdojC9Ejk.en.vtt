00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.669
 anniversary once here my blacks 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:24.929
 we just have to give it on the maps 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.730
 that are putting us here 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.829
 originals not those that say universal and 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.839
 the originals for example is not going 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:32.369
 to give him in lock so once 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:35.160
 we are in blockade I recommend you 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.050
 the game is set to default 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.730
 equipment snipers so you do not 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.650
 have to come and get them snipers 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.330
 once we are here in blockade we are going to 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.860
 have to shoot in this rock that makes 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.690
 that falls that is a very nice effect 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.750
 when you're in multiplayer and we 're going to 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.940
 have to look for the can of soda blast 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.740
 that is total in horta they will see what 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.480
 is this they are going to come here they are going to 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.550
 point and this little thing that you are seeing 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.410
 here are the soda cans once 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.090
 we shoot you are going to give us some achievements 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.520
 thanks to the updates allowed 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.559
 that they did not give them before and for every 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.939
 universal genius map and there is a can 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.650
 I 'm going to show you all the cans that 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.460
 there's here on the next map we're 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.900
 watching a semi 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.270
 are going to have to come here to these 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.670
 green colored drums the one 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.320
 next to the first structure as they are 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.450
 seeing here and here are going to have to 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.520
 search down here at this time I do not know 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.050
 see because it was very far left like this 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.640
 that are going to have to go up are going to 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.350
 they have to pay in this box that I do not 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.390
 I'm paying here and now they're going to 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.759
 can see the soda there is the next 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.440
 map area just as always 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.800
 we shoot and in a few seconds we will 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.230
 give the achievement 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.120
 in the following map it is called stone town 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.220
 and we're going to have to appear in the other 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.780
 side of the beach if they appear on the beach 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.730
 they're going to have to come here to this other 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.700
 base and this is super simple 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.650
 they just jump on this box type 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.260
 with a blue blanket and between these two 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.480
 boxes there will be the area and the truth 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.740
 this is the easiest of all in the 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.870
 next is one that is a bit 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.580
 complicated that is called bloglines and not 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.620
 It is complicated but it may not 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.210
 reach to see in the video I know that 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.770
 you may not see the 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.120
 cans because I in the miniature of 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.830
 video did not reach very well to see the 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.840
 cans but when you are playing 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.480
 they will see it or they will have to come 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.490
 to the blue base the blue base of block 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.530
 line and they're going to have to look in front 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.180
 here where is the sniper and in these 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.280
 structures there are the can of 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.020
 sodemasa if they already saw it if they do not see this 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.090
 roll that I'm aiming check that 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.490
 tree and can be given by the tip of the 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.110
 tree go down tantito are going to see that same 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.090
 structure and there will be the can of 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.650
 soda we shoot him and we're going to have 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.680
 our achievement remember that it is in the 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.300
 blue base the next one is in warlord and 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.400
 it is one that is also very simple 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.190
 Warlord has four very easy bases 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.680
 yellow Red 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.650
 and green as you can see here is red and 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.000
 we still do not go without us it 's yellow ok 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.620
 so head towards the base of 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.720
 yellow and once we're here 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.790
 on the right side on the right side 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.770
 let's see this rock here and there it is 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.290
 our soda there is our can of 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.630
 soda is also very simple this 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.700
 Welsh block down are the simplest and 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.190
 and finally we have one of the maps 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.140
 favorites throughout the community hello 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.150
 you tell me your favorite map 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.830
 but is this good for me to let him 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.450
 universal and salt bill we are going to 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.190
 surrender here where is the rifle 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.930
 fairies and they can take it or they can not 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.790
 take the truth does not matter at all 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.740
 but if it is in a it is not there but 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.660
 obviously to be much easier this 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.850
 let's see what a structure is here 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.620
 of a destroyed temple and part of 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.660
 up just right here there goes to 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.780
 be the tin is also very easy 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.100
 to use do not worry if you do not see them 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.110
 I say life is not going to be seen with 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.550
 to be playing is very easy and once 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.040

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.110

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.060
 also the achievement of the map will give us 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.500
 an achievement for each map and in the end we 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.450
 they will give all the achievements as they can 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.950
