00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
news is these videos cannot look pretty

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.980 
news is these videos cannot look pretty
quick<00:01:15.820> because<00:01:16.000> I<00:01:16.180> don't<00:01:16.329> need<00:01:16.479> to<00:01:16.539> edit<00:01:16.689> them

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
quick because I don't need to edit them

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.169 
quick because I don't need to edit them
as<00:01:17.500> you<00:01:17.680> saw<00:01:17.950> from<00:01:18.220> that<00:01:18.280> last<00:01:18.579> series<00:01:18.970> that<00:01:19.149> I

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:19.179 
as you saw from that last series that I

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:21.300 
as you saw from that last series that I
did<00:01:19.479> for<00:01:20.020> whatever<00:01:20.140> reason<00:01:20.619> Street<00:01:20.860> Fighter<00:01:21.039> 4

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
did for whatever reason Street Fighter 4

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.190 
did for whatever reason Street Fighter 4
looks<00:01:21.549> good<00:01:21.789> even<00:01:22.060> if<00:01:22.270> it<00:01:22.390> has<00:01:22.509> a<00:01:22.539> lower<00:01:22.810> frame

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
looks good even if it has a lower frame

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.529 
looks good even if it has a lower frame
framerate<00:01:24.100> probably<00:01:25.090> because<00:01:25.299> the<00:01:25.420> game

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
framerate probably because the game

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:28.620 
framerate probably because the game
itself<00:01:25.840> isn't<00:01:26.049> a<00:01:26.200> very<00:01:26.350> high<00:01:26.560> frame<00:01:26.829> rate<00:01:27.630> so

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
itself isn't a very high frame rate so

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.859 
itself isn't a very high frame rate so
