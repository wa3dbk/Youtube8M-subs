00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.890 
bathtub just a quick note do not turn
the<00:03:29.620> water<00:03:29.830> on<00:03:30.190> in<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:31.120> sink<00:03:31.420> that<00:03:31.630> you<00:03:31.780> are

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
the water on in the sink that you are

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.560 
the water on in the sink that you are
working<00:03:32.110> in<00:03:32.550> because<00:03:33.550> you<00:03:33.670> pulled<00:03:34.030> out<00:03:34.210> that

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
working in because you pulled out that

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.930 
working in because you pulled out that
rod<00:03:34.990> underneath<00:03:35.560> the<00:03:35.710> sink<00:03:35.950> which<00:03:36.460> leaves<00:03:36.790> an

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
rod underneath the sink which leaves an

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.970 
rod underneath the sink which leaves an
opening<00:03:37.450> in<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:37.870> drainage<00:03:38.140> pipe<00:03:38.530> and<00:03:38.770> that

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
opening in the drainage pipe and that

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.550 
opening in the drainage pipe and that
can<00:03:39.130> obviously<00:03:39.630> cause<00:03:40.630> a<00:03:40.690> leak<00:03:41.080> and<00:03:41.290> allow

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
can obviously cause a leak and allow

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.070 
can obviously cause a leak and allow
water<00:03:41.920> to<00:03:42.100> escape<00:03:42.430> so<00:03:43.240> do<00:03:43.390> not<00:03:43.570> turn<00:03:43.900> this

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
water to escape so do not turn this

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.160 
water to escape so do not turn this
water<00:03:44.350> on<00:03:44.620> but<00:03:45.250> instead<00:03:45.730> rinse<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.570> stopper

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
water on but instead rinse the stopper

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.990 
water on but instead rinse the stopper
in<00:03:47.380> a<00:03:47.470> different<00:03:47.890> sink<00:03:48.160> or<00:03:48.310> in<00:03:48.370> your<00:03:48.790> bathtub

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
the drainage pipe right over here so I'm

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:21.790
