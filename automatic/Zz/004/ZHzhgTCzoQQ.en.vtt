every one is down down down down up up
down<00:02:48.239> up<00:02:49.230> down<00:02:49.500> up<00:02:49.700> down<00:02:50.700> down<00:02:50.760> up<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:52.340> then

down up down up down down up and then

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.400 
down up down up down down up and then
down<00:02:54.540> down<00:02:54.600> down<00:02:55.410> up<00:02:55.970> so<00:02:56.970> that's<00:02:57.180> all<00:02:57.540> if<00:02:57.989> I'm

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
down down down up so that's all if I'm

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.170 
down down down up so that's all if I'm
just<00:02:58.739> going<00:02:59.100> for<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.400> certain<00:02:59.640> thing<00:02:59.850> that's

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
just going for a certain thing that's

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.660 
just going for a certain thing that's
over<00:03:00.630> if<00:03:00.900> you're<00:03:01.110> an<00:03:01.200> eight<00:03:01.410> if<00:03:01.769> for<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.370> first

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
over if you're an eight if for the first

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.870 
over if you're an eight if for the first
two<00:03:03.000> lines<00:03:03.209> when<00:03:04.019> you<00:03:04.140> go<00:03:04.260> down<00:03:04.560> down<00:03:04.980> down<00:03:05.280> on

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
two lines when you go down down down on

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.300 
two lines when you go down down down on
each<00:03:06.239> quarter<00:03:06.989> for<00:03:07.230> that<00:03:07.349> which<00:03:07.500> is<00:03:07.530> C<00:03:07.830> G<00:03:08.280> a

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
each quarter for that which is C G a

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.729 
each quarter for that which is C G a
minor<00:03:08.700> so<00:03:09.030> every<00:03:09.299> time<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:09.630> get<00:03:09.810> three<00:03:10.350> chords

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
minor so every time you get three chords

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.920 
minor so every time you get three chords
right<00:03:10.920> next<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.310> each<00:03:11.459> other<00:03:11.700> it's<00:03:12.090> just<00:03:12.570> down

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
right next to each other it's just down

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.340 
right next to each other it's just down
down<00:03:13.320> down<00:03:13.709> and<00:03:14.040> then<00:03:14.280> on<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.519> last<00:03:15.079> the<00:03:16.079> last

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
down down and then on the last the last

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.410 
down down and then on the last the last
one<00:03:16.709> you're<00:03:17.130> going<00:03:17.250> to<00:03:17.370> continue<00:03:18.030> in<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.239> same

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
one you're going to continue in the same

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.870 
one you're going to continue in the same
track<00:03:18.690> kind<00:03:18.959> of<00:03:19.079> just<00:03:19.260> see<00:03:19.440> it<00:03:19.500> so<00:03:20.070> this<00:03:20.730> is

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
track kind of just see it so this is

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.640 
track kind of just see it so this is
what<00:03:21.030> it<00:03:21.150> sounds<00:03:21.420> like<00:03:21.450> boss<00:03:22.109> and<00:03:22.530> they're

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
what it sounds like boss and they're

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:29.020 
what it sounds like boss and they're
shown<00:03:22.859> it<00:03:23.100> sounds<00:03:23.340> like<00:03:23.459> normal

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.729 

that's<00:03:30.030> what<00:03:30.180> it<00:03:30.299> sounds<00:03:30.600> like<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:31.019> so<00:03:31.380> it's

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
that's what it sounds like and so it's

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.190 
that's what it sounds like and so it's
like<00:03:32.040> this

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
like this

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.940 
like this
down<00:03:34.200> down<00:03:34.650> down<00:03:35.010> up<00:03:35.459> up<00:03:36.120> down<00:03:36.420> up<00:03:36.959> down<00:03:37.019> up

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
down down down up up down up down up

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.790 
down down down up up down up down up

down down

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.800 
down down
down<00:03:41.010> down<00:03:41.520> down<00:03:41.580> down

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.970 

so<00:03:45.810> that's<00:03:45.990> what<00:03:46.170> it's<00:03:46.320> like<00:03:46.380> throughout<00:03:46.800> the

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
so that's what it's like throughout the

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.730 
so that's what it's like throughout the
stock<00:03:47.250> of<00:03:47.550> throughout<00:03:47.850> fevers<00:03:48.360> and<00:03:48.810> when<00:03:49.620> you

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
stock of throughout fevers and when you

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.040 
stock of throughout fevers and when you
get<00:03:49.920> to<00:03:50.270> nothing<00:03:51.270> personal<00:03:51.720> we're<00:03:51.840> going<00:03:51.990> to

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
get to nothing personal we're going to

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.800 
get to nothing personal we're going to
see<00:03:52.260> gene<00:03:52.590> if<00:03:52.800> then<00:03:53.670> you<00:03:53.730> do<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:54.030> core<00:03:54.450> panic

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
see gene if then you do the core panic

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.130 
see gene if then you do the core panic
if<00:03:55.400> you<00:03:56.400> do<00:03:56.580> the<00:03:56.730> core<00:03:56.970> pen<00:03:57.240> of<00:03:57.390> the<00:03:57.420> G<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:58.110> you

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
if you do the core pen of the G and you

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.010 
if you do the core pen of the G and you
do<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.680> core<00:03:58.890> pattern<00:03:59.220> for<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.490> minor<00:03:59.850> so<00:04:00.720> there

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
do the core pattern for a minor so there

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.020 
do the core pattern for a minor so there
is<00:04:01.140> no<00:04:01.320> down<00:04:01.650> down<00:04:01.680> down<00:04:02.310> within<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:02.850> dose

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
is no down down down within the dose

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.410 
is no down down down within the dose
it's<00:04:03.510> know<00:04:03.800> three<00:04:04.800> chords<00:04:05.280> all<00:04:05.640> together<00:04:05.880> they

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
it's know three chords all together they

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.240 
it's know three chords all together they
have<00:04:06.660> they<00:04:07.260> go<00:04:07.410> sit<00:04:07.680> for<00:04:07.830> it<00:04:07.890> for<00:04:08.100> a<00:04:08.130> little

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
have they go sit for it for a little

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.970 
have they go sit for it for a little
while<00:04:08.400> each<00:04:08.810> so<00:04:09.810> just<00:04:10.020> a<00:04:10.140> previous<00:04:10.620> strumming

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
while each so just a previous strumming

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.220 
while each so just a previous strumming
