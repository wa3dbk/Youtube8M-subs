00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.500
 eight artists 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.999
 what is it first separated 

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:09.849
 a lot of people do 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:12.489
 in the foot 

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:14.979
 his life as an artist is a jewel 

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:17.979
 the creator expresses his own personality 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.770
 thinking that his door while some wallets constant challenge 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.770
 it smells like poverty 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.199
 it is impossible to understand 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.270
 Exceeded it is very rare someone who has a complete personal approach 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.860
 for patrick martin 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.030
 marries a source 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.080
 there is not yet 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.120
 the sales representative goes after the creatures you represent to 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.990
 the gallery claims as an artist on Tuesday 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.980
 how to shop in a parking lot 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.980
 I am with the wooden rod regularity in a meal 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.820
 so I call a church 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.700
 and erase remotely 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.040
 it was really nothing to see 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.560
 and in that sense these people are never thought that ranking 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.500
 quÃ©bec quebec 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.500
 to me 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.590
 charlebois stone 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.120
 I do not see why it works 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.120
 and a general outfit of their work 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.860
 but already in strong growth as in station 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.410
 the actor 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.820
 and apart from leaving the precepts 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.860
 from parliamentary source 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.920
 Aravane menard rezai 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.630
 and it is from the beginning it is pressed the subsidiaries 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.609
 a very strong style to universality this last solution 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.750
 the artists you represent here are of course also artists who if 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.750
 they express themselves on other transom supports 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.409
 this attack occurred on the spot that you have 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:11.039
 already invited as a sculptor 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.039
 the elegance quite accurate 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.289
 according to haaretz 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:20.289
 the actresses 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.219
 It is necessary to talk about it 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:26.219
 some users 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:31.219
 eric abidal 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:33.949
 so it's pretty complicated 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:37.139
 the orchestral dispersion 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:40.139
 serge attal 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:47.809
 viewing 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:50.509
 yes because you opened the gallery 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:53.709
 December 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.739
 the star of the barÃ§a a job 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.889
 2 july joan baez the mucem he arrived in paris 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.149
 in its place 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:07.349
 alstom came from the middle feet and the biniou million to the city of paris 

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:10.229
 the icesave agreement 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:13.229
 very bad trip 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:17.269
 and why not face these technical challenges 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.540
 Well, it's not a job you mentioned just now 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.799
 just very different from jewelery and the traditional blue 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.799
 what are for example typical weathered materials one can 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.769
 discover to children 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.799
 called the cncd that has already been constituted 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.079
 pebbles 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.079
 the stones of nathalie's company 

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:42.649
 in fact what effect 

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:50.229
 Pentecost a month ago the logo took up the burning challenge a month 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:53.969
 to take part are welcome 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:56.849
 m at the haye 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.849
 even the rain 

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:03.399
 that did not do it 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.019
 the most creative and posed 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.239
 in fact the request 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.119
 and then she 

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:19.120
 you could draw a typology form and men's women who 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.560
 are sensitive to this type of woman's vision with the tactics of people 

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:23.699
 chic 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.440
 she smiles 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.800
 they are cultivated 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.620
 the artistic sportswoman and sophie in the good sense for 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.460
 it's his departure around 3 pm 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.060
 kevin kutz opera response to under 12 kaboul bringing for me 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:40.069
 powerful head 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:42.240
 independent often 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.240
 evgueni quebec science 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.379
 or else people are 65 years old 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:52.379
 architects and decorators the state 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.080
 no advance 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.169
 he was especially happy 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.659
 for men but these investigations do not chipotons general 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:06.800
 and then even if it is necessary because other sources 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.680
 but they can also leave passage collectibles 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.999
 vulgarity and more we do not display his money 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:15.169
 it's like that
