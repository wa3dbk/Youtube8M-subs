00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
are number one game settings now game

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.250 
are number one game settings now game
settings<00:00:29.099> there's<00:00:29.460> four<00:00:29.820> sub<00:00:30.300> topics<00:00:30.840> that

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
settings there's four sub topics that

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.120 
settings there's four sub topics that
are<00:00:31.289> inside<00:00:32.189> here<00:00:32.520> it's<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.630> stickler<00:00:34.440> but<00:00:34.739> now

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
are inside here it's a stickler but now

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.000 
are inside here it's a stickler but now
vibration<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.180> sensitivity<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.350> first<00:00:37.829> off

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
vibration and sensitivity so first off

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.790 
vibration and sensitivity so first off
stickler<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:39.000> suggest<00:00:39.989> default<00:00:40.500> but<00:00:40.739> it

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
stickler I suggest default but it

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.490 
stickler I suggest default but it
depends<00:00:41.070> on<00:00:41.219> yourself<00:00:41.579> preference<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.480> lot<00:00:43.469> of

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.980 
much as you can't I can out of the class
that<00:02:19.400> makes<00:02:20.270> it<00:02:20.450> possible<00:02:20.570> for<00:02:20.810> you<00:02:20.960> to

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
that makes it possible for you to

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.800 
that makes it possible for you to
produce<00:02:21.320> clip<00:02:21.910> that's<00:02:22.910> pretty<00:02:23.510> much<00:02:23.600> all<00:02:23.750> I

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
produce clip that's pretty much all I

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.780 
produce clip that's pretty much all I
have<00:02:23.990> to<00:02:24.110> save<00:02:24.260> our<00:02:24.380> classes<00:02:24.800> I'll<00:02:25.340> have<00:02:25.550> them

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
have to save our classes I'll have them

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
it's that are easy to determine where

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.830 
it's that are easy to determine where
the<00:02:39.110> enemy<00:02:39.470> spawn<00:02:39.800> so<00:02:40.459> like<00:02:40.700> domination<00:02:41.540> where

and what I discuss about games like

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.550 
and what I discuss about games like
sentient<00:03:16.489> game<00:03:16.730> types<00:03:17.060> this<00:03:17.900> sort<00:03:18.110> of<00:03:18.170> Carly

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
sentient game types this sort of Carly

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.130 
sentient game types this sort of Carly
to<00:03:18.709> that<00:03:18.860> as<00:03:19.070> in<00:03:20.260> spawn<00:03:21.260> points<00:03:21.790> etc<00:03:23.140> basically

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
to that as in spawn points etc basically

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.120 
to that as in spawn points etc basically
a<00:03:24.860> matter<00:03:25.340> of<00:03:25.430> knowing<00:03:25.880> where<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.269> spawn<00:03:26.630> is

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
a matter of knowing where the spawn is

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.530 
a matter of knowing where the spawn is
knowing<00:03:28.130> will<00:03:28.280> type<00:03:28.519> of<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:28.760> players<00:03:29.060> that

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
knowing will type of the players that

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.140 
knowing will type of the players that

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
you're playing against as in are they

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.960 
you're playing against as in are they
snipers<00:03:32.810> or<00:03:33.350> the<00:03:33.560> same<00:03:33.980> type<00:03:34.220> of<00:03:34.250> players<00:03:34.580> you

or they come for clips are they

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.979 
or they come for clips are they
objective<00:03:37.370> players<00:03:37.640> I<00:03:37.910> love<00:03:38.510> to<00:03:38.630> play<00:03:38.720> against

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
objective players I love to play against

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.699 
objective players I love to play against
objective<00:03:39.590> flies<00:03:39.860> and<00:03:41.260> simply<00:03:42.260> because<00:03:42.530> it's

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
objective flies and simply because it's

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.530 
objective flies and simply because it's
easier<00:03:43.010> to<00:03:43.130> depict<00:03:43.670> where<00:03:43.970> the<00:03:44.060> enemies<00:03:44.330> will

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
easier to depict where the enemies will

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.979 
easier to depict where the enemies will
be<00:03:44.570> heading<00:03:44.989> so<00:03:45.970> with<00:03:46.970> objective<00:03:47.720> players

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
be heading so with objective players

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.920 
be heading so with objective players
like<00:03:48.709> enemies<00:03:49.130> will<00:03:49.670> obviously<00:03:50.120> be<00:03:50.480> heading

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
like enemies will obviously be heading

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.009 
like enemies will obviously be heading
towards<00:03:51.230> the<00:03:51.350> objective<00:03:51.890> so<00:03:52.730> that's<00:03:53.570> simply

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
towards the objective so that's simply

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.690 
towards the objective so that's simply
why<00:03:54.140> I<00:03:54.200> enjoy<00:03:54.500> playing<00:03:54.860> against<00:03:55.190> objective

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
why I enjoy playing against objective

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.960 
why I enjoy playing against objective
place<00:03:55.850> and<00:03:56.470> and<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:58.310> last<00:03:58.549> thing<00:03:58.730> I<00:03:58.790> want<00:03:58.910> to

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970

place and and the last thing I want to
talk<00:03:59.150> about<00:03:59.209> is<00:03:59.830> number<00:04:00.830> 5<00:04:01.070> and<00:04:01.400> this<00:04:02.060> is

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
talk about is number 5 and this is

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.270 
talk about is number 5 and this is
probably<00:04:03.200> one<00:04:03.410> of<00:04:03.440> the<00:04:03.530> most<00:04:03.650> important

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
probably one of the most important

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.160 
probably one of the most important
things<00:04:04.459> about<00:04:04.580> getting<00:04:04.940> clips<00:04:05.239> and<00:04:05.540> not<00:04:05.989> many

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
things about getting clips and not many

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.539 
things about getting clips and not many
people<00:04:06.470> know<00:04:06.590> about<00:04:06.769> it<00:04:07.000> so<00:04:08.000> number<00:04:08.390> five<00:04:08.660> is

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
people know about it so number five is

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:14.080 
people know about it so number five is
