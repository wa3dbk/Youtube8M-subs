00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.989
 I already anticipate that we have 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.550
 new champion of the championship of spain 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.500

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.229

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.369
 ground rally in 2012 has been 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.770
 absolutely overwhelming as it has 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.479
 achieved all the victories full of 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.460

 total of one hour increased 24 seconds and 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.220
 therefore they achieve victory 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.950

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.470
 championship and each rally then a touch 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.960
 of special interest, very good result 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.360

 a time of one hour seven minutes 51 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:41.330

 champion of terry pons and xavi active 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.200
 as we said we also have options for 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:50.069
 his championship although everything will depend on 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:53.420
 how do you do it in the last date at the end 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:56.690
 of the next month of October 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.170
 and finally we see in your ford party 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.180
 Ramón Ferreyros with Diego Vallejo 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.310
 they finished in fifth position in this 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.489
 sixth championship of spain 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.780
 of land rallies should be noted 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.860
 also the abandonment by mechanical breakdown 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:15.230
 de pedro by the general head xevi 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.630

 ferreyros and rubén gracia 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.110
 joy more justified for xavi 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.830
 pons for the Catalan who 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.960
 then we listen 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.900
 Well the truth is that it has gone very well 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.690
 it's been a complicated rally there was a lot 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.800
 dust there was not much grip but we have 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.650
 could win the rally and win the 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.090
 championship was the goal of this year 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.770
 Although it seems easy, it has not been easy 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.710
 the first ones have made it difficult for us 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.320
 races were and ferreyros that have 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.780
 tight tight and nothing at the end objective 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.430
 fulfilled and very happy 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.800
 Well let's see what happened 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.959
 regarding the all-terrain category 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.030
 let's remember a journey with 600 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.310
 kilometers where stop for these cars 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.350
 plus a prologue test on Friday that 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.300
 determined the order of departure for the 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.390
 Saturday in earth rallies the distance 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.920
 of 140 kilometers divided into four 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.720
 stretches we see in action the champion to 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.360
 michelle drone barrier next to didier 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.420
 that 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.220
 a michel turón that taking advantage of 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.130
 qualities of your buggy in the zones 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.530
 fast he did a race of less than 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.080
 more started a 'red racing car' then it was 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.730
 toning up to get this unpublished 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.960
 and meritorious of course first 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.990
 position here in lerma 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.419
 in images josé zaragoza with joseph 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.729
 lópez in his bowling nemesis josé zaragoza 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.889
 that thanks to this second position watched 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.840
 that Antonio Lopez was fifth will fight for 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:43.520
 the championship in the last test yet 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.220
 There are options for victory for Jose 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.039
 zaragoza separate only 32 points 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.830
 to the two pilots therefore the 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:54.620
 emotion is served zaragoza finished 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.180
 little more than five minutes of French 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.250

 ssangyong the two are burgaleses so 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.080
 that then we could say that 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.250
 they knew the area well they had not 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.669
 participated in other tests of 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.680
 championship and to know the area apart 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.990
 of their good driving they got 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.940
 finish in third position in this 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.360

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.670
 and another Frenchman who also had his 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.340
 important degree of prominence in this 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:35.800
 proof was françois lurton point with 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.330
