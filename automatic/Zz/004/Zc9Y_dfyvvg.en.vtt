surprisingly<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.700> only<00:01:23.820> took<00:01:24.000> me<00:01:24.150> one<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.750> to

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
surprisingly it only took me one can to

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.859 
surprisingly it only took me one can to
do<00:01:25.020> all<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.670> whereas<00:01:26.670> with<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.030> green<00:01:27.659> paint

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
relatively you what I used here was this

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.860 
relatively you what I used here was this
mobile<00:03:13.070> one<00:03:13.310> full<00:03:14.090> synthetic<00:03:14.410> 10w30<00:03:16.870> so

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
mobile one full synthetic 10w30 so

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.920 
mobile one full synthetic 10w30 so
that's<00:03:18.020> all<00:03:18.140> filled<00:03:18.350> up<00:03:18.500> now<00:03:18.709> so<00:03:19.900> it<00:03:20.900> should

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
that's all filled up now so it should

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.190 
that's all filled up now so it should
just<00:03:21.260> need<00:03:21.470> some<00:03:21.709> gas<00:03:21.920> and<00:03:22.060> it<00:03:23.060> should<00:03:23.270> fire<00:03:23.570> so

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
just need some gas and it should fire so

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.130 
just need some gas and it should fire so
we'll<00:03:24.860> see<00:03:25.010> about<00:03:25.100> that<00:03:25.220> a<00:03:25.400> little<00:03:25.550> later<00:03:26.140> so

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.150 
starting food and I'll show you video
that<00:03:45.890> now<00:03:47.320> all<00:03:48.320> right<00:03:48.440> so<00:03:48.709> here's<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.010> motor

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
that now all right so here's the motor

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.430 
that now all right so here's the motor
and<00:03:49.489> I<00:03:49.520> attempt<00:03:49.910> to<00:03:49.940> film<00:03:50.180> this<00:03:50.330> with<00:03:50.690> one<00:03:51.020> hand

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:09.210 

the<00:03:53.800> GX<00:04:02.670> take<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:03.790> filter<00:04:04.150> out<00:04:07.800> space<00:04:08.800> um<00:04:08.980> carb

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
the GX take the filter out space um carb

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:31.260 
the GX take the filter out space um carb
cleaner<00:04:10.230> engine<00:04:29.010> so<00:04:30.010> not<00:04:30.190> much<00:04:30.400> but<00:04:30.730> as<00:04:31.090> you

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
cleaner engine so not much but as you

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.990 
cleaner engine so not much but as you
can<00:04:31.390> tell<00:04:31.540> market<00:04:32.200> right<00:04:32.320> up<00:04:32.670> obviously<00:04:33.670> I

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
can tell market right up obviously I

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.380 
can tell market right up obviously I
just<00:04:34.810> ran<00:04:35.020> out<00:04:35.050> of<00:04:35.170> starting<00:04:35.530> fluid<00:04:35.710> because

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
just ran out of starting fluid because

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.520 
just ran out of starting fluid because
can't<00:04:37.390> hold<00:04:37.540> can<00:04:37.750> with<00:04:37.870> one<00:04:38.020> hand<00:04:38.230> spray<00:04:38.410> with

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
can't hold can with one hand spray with

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.020 
can't hold can with one hand spray with
the<00:04:38.620> other

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
the other

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.580 
the other
so<00:04:40.030> once<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:40.420> tank<00:04:40.630> gets<00:04:40.810> fixed<00:04:41.170> we<00:04:41.350> will<00:04:41.440> have

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
so once the tank gets fixed we will have

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.050 
so once the tank gets fixed we will have
a<00:04:41.620> good<00:04:42.190> running<00:04:42.760> GX<00:04:43.480> 140
