00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.430
 I am celine porterie responsible for 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:26.020
 the quality of the sector its name at 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:28.000
 labeyrie to do the best often 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.730
 we must first take care of the 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.400
 let grow in fresh water set 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.920
 trust created by the mayor is a 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.290
 exclusive quality approach that is based 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.809
 out of 70 checkpoints that are going to be

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.460
 for example water quality 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.850

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.720
 this advice at labeyrie is that it 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.640
 must allow time to respect 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.200

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.780
 the man to our criteria of requirement for

 always more excellence what is 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.290

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.770
 enough room to move for 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.210
