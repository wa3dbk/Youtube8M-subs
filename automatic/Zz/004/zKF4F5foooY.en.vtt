all<00:00:01.829> right<00:00:01.979> so<00:00:02.129> I<00:00:02.190> had<00:00:02.399> a<00:00:02.429> question<00:00:02.669> today<00:00:03.000> on

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
all right so I had a question today on

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.579 
all right so I had a question today on
how<00:00:04.049> to<00:00:04.110> play<00:00:04.470> MK<00:00:05.190> for<00:00:05.549> mortal<00:00:06.330> kombat<00:00:06.690> 4<00:00:06.720> on<00:00:07.560> a

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
how to play MK for mortal kombat 4 on a

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.530 
how to play MK for mortal kombat 4 on a

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
dedicated MK 2/3 cabinet this cabinet

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.650 
dedicated MK 2/3 cabinet this cabinet
here<00:00:12.809> is<00:00:13.019> an<00:00:13.170> MK<00:00:13.500> 3<00:00:13.769> cabinet<00:00:14.280> that<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.880> converted

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
here is an MK 3 cabinet that I converted

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.200 
here is an MK 3 cabinet that I converted
from<00:00:15.809> an<00:00:15.960> MK<00:00:16.289> 2<00:00:16.400> since<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:17.490> already<00:00:17.580> have<00:00:17.820> MK<00:00:18.150> 2

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
from an MK 2 since I already have MK 2

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.279 
from an MK 2 since I already have MK 2
over<00:00:18.600> there

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
over there

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.769 
over there
here's<00:00:19.800> MK<00:00:20.340> 4<00:00:20.640> s<00:00:20.730> PCB<00:00:21.240> right<00:00:21.420> here<00:00:21.570> I've<00:00:21.660> had

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
here's MK 4 s PCB right here I've had

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.140 
here's MK 4 s PCB right here I've had
for<00:00:21.990> quite<00:00:22.020> some<00:00:22.320> time<00:00:22.460> I'm<00:00:23.460> pretty<00:00:23.640> sure<00:00:23.910> that

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
for quite some time I'm pretty sure that

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.849 
for quite some time I'm pretty sure that
this<00:00:24.390> video<00:00:24.600> has<00:00:24.840> been<00:00:24.990> done<00:00:25.199> by<00:00:25.410> your<00:00:25.619> main

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
this video has been done by your main

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.460 
this video has been done by your main
man<00:00:26.240> which<00:00:27.240> I've<00:00:27.390> actually<00:00:27.570> seen<00:00:27.990> before<00:00:28.349> he

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
man which I've actually seen before he

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.679 
man which I've actually seen before he
helped<00:00:28.680> me<00:00:28.800> do<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.369> it's<00:00:30.060> pretty<00:00:30.240> simple

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
helped me do it so it's pretty simple

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.359 
helped me do it so it's pretty simple
it's<00:00:30.810> basically<00:00:30.929> just<00:00:31.230> swapping<00:00:31.710> out<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.859> PCB

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
it's basically just swapping out the PCB

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.770 
it's basically just swapping out the PCB
in<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.579> back<00:00:32.759> button<00:00:33.090> I'll<00:00:33.180> kind<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.450> do<00:00:33.630> it

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
in the back button I'll kind of do it

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.110 
in the back button I'll kind of do it
from<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.530> back<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.040> show<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.790> where<00:00:35.969> all<00:00:36.030> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
from the back and show you where all the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.030 
from the back and show you where all the
connections<00:00:36.570> go<00:00:36.750> but<00:00:36.960> there's<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.739> control

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
connections go but there's a control

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.410 
connections go but there's a control
panel<00:00:38.280> MK<00:00:38.790> 4<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.149> exactly<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.719> same<00:00:40.340> I<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:42.030> do

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
panel MK 4 is exactly the same I I do

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.819 
panel MK 4 is exactly the same I I do
have<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:42.960> cable<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.500> I've<00:00:43.649> shown<00:00:43.800> before

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
have this cable that I've shown before

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.100 
have this cable that I've shown before
that<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.340> purchased<00:00:44.879> right<00:00:45.090> here<00:00:45.360> that

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
that I purchased right here that

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.729 
that I purchased right here that
connects<00:00:47.660> back<00:00:48.660> here<00:00:50.420> right<00:00:51.420> there<00:00:51.660> there<00:00:52.620> is

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
connects back here right there there is

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.340 
connects back here right there there is
another<00:00:52.980> one<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.219> should<00:00:53.579> go<00:00:53.730> here<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.930> I

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
another one that should go here that I

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.660 
another one that should go here that I
just<00:00:55.379> connect<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.219> can<00:00:56.340> see<00:00:56.489> all<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
just connect and you can see all the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.130 
just connect and you can see all the
wire<00:00:56.850> ties<00:00:57.120> right<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.510> just<00:00:57.690> made<00:00:57.899> my<00:00:58.109> own

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
wire ties right that I just made my own

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.889 
wire ties right that I just made my own
wires<00:00:58.440> from<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> player<00:00:59.039> harness

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
wires from the player harness

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:01.939 
wires from the player harness
traditionally<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.079> grey<00:01:01.350> one<00:01:01.590> here<00:01:01.859> is

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
traditionally this grey one here is

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.539 
traditionally this grey one here is
plugged<00:01:02.280> in<00:01:02.570> for<00:01:03.570> MK<00:01:03.930> 2<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.920> purple<00:01:05.430> and

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
plugged in for MK 2 and the purple and

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.940 
plugged in for MK 2 and the purple and
white<00:01:05.640> one<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.810> blue<00:01:07.049> one<00:01:07.080> player<00:01:07.590> 3<00:01:07.920> is

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
white one and the blue one player 3 is

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.469 
white one and the blue one player 3 is
connected<00:01:08.310> but<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.880> didn't<00:01:09.090> use<00:01:09.210> any<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.390> those

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
connected but I didn't use any of those

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.109 
connected but I didn't use any of those
wires<00:01:09.750> like<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.049> said<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.790> I'll<00:01:11.790> show<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.030> how

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
wires like I said so I'll show you how

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.730 
wires like I said so I'll show you how
simple<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.720> basically<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.200> just<00:01:13.229> plug<00:01:13.590> in

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
simple it is basically you just plug in

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.370 
simple it is basically you just plug in
the<00:01:13.830> PCB<00:01:14.159> right<00:01:14.549> here<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.450> Jama<00:01:15.930> connector

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
the PCB right here the Jama connector

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.929 
the PCB right here the Jama connector
and<00:01:16.590> swap<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.009> out<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.340> turn<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.700> machine

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
and swap that out and turn the machine

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.999 
and swap that out and turn the machine
on<00:01:17.970> you're<00:01:18.210> ready<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.450> go<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:18.840> hold<00:01:19.740> tight<00:01:19.979> and

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
on you're ready to go so hold tight and

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:33.120 
on you're ready to go so hold tight and
I'll<00:01:20.220> swap<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.460> out

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.650 

I'll<00:01:34.130> try<00:01:34.310> to<00:01:34.340> do<00:01:34.520> this<00:01:34.700> one-handed<00:01:35.090> but<00:01:35.450> it's

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
I'll try to do this one-handed but it's

00:01:35.660 --> 00:02:05.820 
I'll try to do this one-handed but it's
kind<00:01:35.840> of<00:01:35.930> difficult

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:15.480 

I<00:02:12.660> can't<00:02:13.660> remember<00:02:13.840> if<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.310> wire<00:02:15.310> gets

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
I can't remember if the wire gets

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.940 
I can't remember if the wire gets
plugged<00:02:15.790> in<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:15.940> player<00:02:16.120> 3<00:02:16.510> or<00:02:17.050> player<00:02:17.620> 4

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
plugged in the player 3 or player 4

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.620 
plugged in the player 3 or player 4
we'll<00:02:18.130> just<00:02:18.280> try<00:02:18.460> player<00:02:18.820> 4<00:02:19.090> first<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:19.480> see

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
we'll just try player 4 first and see

00:02:19.630 --> 00:03:20.480 
we'll just try player 4 first and see
what<00:02:19.720> happens<00:02:20.020> but<00:02:20.280> let's<00:02:21.280> give<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:21.520> a<00:02:21.580> shot

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.690 

nope<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.780> wrong<00:03:21.930> connectivism<00:03:22.440> pressing<00:03:22.950> low

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
nope the wrong connectivism pressing low

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.500 
nope the wrong connectivism pressing low
punch<00:03:23.940> right<00:03:24.180> here

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
punch right here

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.210 
punch right here
and<00:03:25.080> nothing<00:03:25.290> comes<00:03:25.410> out<00:03:25.620> so<00:03:25.770> I'll<00:03:25.860> just<00:03:25.980> swap

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
and nothing comes out so I'll just swap

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.000 
and nothing comes out so I'll just swap
that<00:03:26.370> out<00:03:26.580> real<00:03:26.910> quick<00:03:30.440> so<00:03:31.440> this<00:03:31.620> connector

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
that out real quick so this connector

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.610 
that out real quick so this connector
right<00:03:32.160> here<00:03:32.220> has<00:03:32.520> to<00:03:32.550> go<00:03:32.790> into<00:03:33.290> layer<00:03:34.290> three

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
right here has to go into layer three

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:44.479 
right here has to go into layer three
connector<00:03:34.980> or<00:03:35.040> not<00:03:35.160> player<00:03:35.370> four
