00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
it be a better test probably but that's

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
easy anyways and so you know the gerber

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:16.640 
easy anyways and so you know the gerber
is<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:12.619> bit<00:01:13.619> thicker<00:01:14.220> overall<00:01:15.090> but<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:16.259> blades

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
is a bit thicker overall but the blades

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.070 
is a bit thicker overall but the blades
may<00:01:16.920> be<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.100> little<00:01:17.280> bit<00:01:17.490> finer<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:18.869> got

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
may be a little bit finer and it's got

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.070 
may be a little bit finer and it's got
yeah<00:01:19.920> it's<00:01:20.100> also<00:01:20.220> cut<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:22.220> just<00:01:23.780> see<00:01:24.780> how<00:01:24.869> that

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
yeah it's also cut so just see how that

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:38.810 
yeah it's also cut so just see how that
does<00:01:32.780> what<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.810> can<00:01:34.049> see<00:01:35.090> it's<00:01:37.460> it's<00:01:38.460> actually

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
does what I can see it's it's actually

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.130 
does what I can see it's it's actually
just<00:01:39.000> ripping<00:01:39.810> chunks<00:01:40.579> out<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.640> bit<00:01:41.970> more<00:01:44.720> and<00:01:45.720> I

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
just ripping chunks out a bit more and I

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.780 
just ripping chunks out a bit more and I
guess<00:01:46.320> that's<00:01:46.470> just<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:47.399> look<00:01:47.549> at<00:01:47.670> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
guess that's just you look at the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.480 
guess that's just you look at the
profile<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.899> might<00:01:49.320> be<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.530> little<00:01:49.710> point<00:01:50.189> here

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
profile it might be a little point here

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.270 
profile it might be a little point here
but<00:01:51.000> it's<00:01:51.149> obviously<00:01:51.659> quite<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.590> bit<00:01:52.799> wider<00:01:53.600> so

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
but it's obviously quite a bit wider so

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.179 
but it's obviously quite a bit wider so
anyways<00:01:56.540> you<00:01:57.540> know<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:58.710> only<00:01:58.770> way<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:58.979> learn

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
anyways you know the only way you learn

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.920 
anyways you know the only way you learn
your<00:01:59.399> knifes<00:01:59.640> is<00:02:00.509> playing<00:02:01.110> with<00:02:01.320> them<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:02.930> more

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
your knifes is playing with them so more

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.390 
your knifes is playing with them so more
7<00:02:04.439> 11<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:04.979> gerber<00:02:05.790> lmf<00:02:05.909> to
