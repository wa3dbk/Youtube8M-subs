going to take this image and we're going
to<00:00:54.160> turn<00:00:54.400> it<00:00:54.550> into<00:00:54.700> something<00:00:55.300> like<00:00:55.570> this

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810 
to turn it into something like this

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.530 
to turn it into something like this
which<00:00:56.470> is<00:00:56.620> one<00:00:56.800> that<00:00:56.920> I<00:00:57.010> uploaded<00:00:57.370> to<00:00:57.760> my

like<00:01:00.579> the<00:01:00.700> look<00:01:00.880> of<00:01:01.290> so<00:01:02.290> we<00:01:02.980> start<00:01:03.250> off<00:01:03.399> by

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
like the look of so we start off by

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.680 
like the look of so we start off by
going<00:01:03.850> to<00:01:04.059> filter<00:01:05.550> pixelate<00:01:07.259> meso<00:01:08.259> tint<00:01:08.649> and

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
going to filter pixelate meso tint and

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.469 
going to filter pixelate meso tint and
set<00:01:10.690> it<00:01:10.869> to<00:01:11.110> medium<00:01:11.470> lines<00:01:11.950> it<00:01:12.910> normally<00:01:13.330> only

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
set it to medium lines it normally only

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.469 
set it to medium lines it normally only
starts<00:01:14.259> up<00:01:14.410> as<00:01:14.530> fine<00:01:14.770> dots<00:01:15.100> but<00:01:16.000> if<00:01:16.119> you've<00:01:16.450> got

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
starts up as fine dots but if you've got

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.420 
starts up as fine dots but if you've got
fine<00:01:16.840> dice<00:01:17.050> just<00:01:17.290> change<00:01:17.500> it<00:01:17.619> to<00:01:17.740> medium<00:01:17.890> lines

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
fine dice just change it to medium lines

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.389 
fine dice just change it to medium lines
that's<00:01:18.729> all<00:01:18.910> I<00:01:18.970> prefer<00:01:19.450> click<00:01:20.380> OK<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:21.190> you

image we then go to filter and blur and
we<00:01:29.619> choose<00:01:29.860> radial<00:01:30.640> blur<00:01:30.850> and<00:01:31.679> we're<00:01:32.679> looking

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069 
we choose radial blur and we're looking

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:37.320 
we choose radial blur and we're looking
for<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.720> amount<00:01:35.020> being<00:01:35.259> a<00:01:35.410> hundred<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:37.090> blow

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
for the amount being a hundred the blow

for the amount being a hundred the blow
method<00:01:37.750> being<00:01:37.959> zoom<00:01:38.319> and<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:39.340> quantity<00:01:39.850> being

method being zoom and the quantity being

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.559 
method being zoom and the quantity being
best<00:01:40.800> now<00:01:41.800> for<00:01:42.130> this<00:01:42.700> video<00:01:43.000> I'm<00:01:43.149> just<00:01:43.179> going

best now for this video I'm just going
to<00:01:43.780> do<00:01:44.020> that<00:01:44.709> once<00:01:45.069> you<00:01:45.429> might<00:01:45.880> want<00:01:46.119> to<00:01:46.179> do<00:01:46.390> it

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569 
to do that once you might want to do it

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:49.740 
to do that once you might want to do it
two<00:01:46.780> three<00:01:47.259> maybe<00:01:47.800> as<00:01:47.979> many<00:01:48.130> as<00:01:48.280> five<00:01:49.060> times<00:01:49.360> to

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
two three maybe as many as five times to

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.040 
two three maybe as many as five times to
get<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:50.020> effect<00:01:50.319> that<00:01:50.380> you<00:01:50.500> want<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:52.720> next

get the effect that you want the next

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.620 
get the effect that you want the next
thing<00:01:53.200> that<00:01:53.229> we're<00:01:53.410> going<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.709> do<00:01:53.920> is<00:01:54.670> to

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
thing that we're going to do is to

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.120 
thing that we're going to do is to
duplicate<00:01:56.349> that<00:01:56.470> layer<00:01:58.709> it<00:01:59.709> doesn't<00:01:59.979> matter

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
duplicate that layer it doesn't matter

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.520 
duplicate that layer it doesn't matter
what<00:02:00.280> we<00:02:00.399> call<00:02:00.640> it<00:02:00.819> I'm<00:02:01.750> just<00:02:02.080> going<00:02:02.259> to<00:02:02.349> turn

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
what we call it I'm just going to turn

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.139 
what we call it I'm just going to turn
that<00:02:02.679> off<00:02:02.740> for<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.099> moment<00:02:03.280> go<00:02:03.610> back<00:02:03.880> to<00:02:04.060> the

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
that off for the moment go back to the

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.499 
that off for the moment go back to the
first<00:02:04.420> layer<00:02:05.190> filter<00:02:06.190> and<00:02:07.000> we're<00:02:07.300> going<00:02:07.479> to

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
first layer filter and we're going to

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.699 
first layer filter and we're going to
choose<00:02:07.720> distort<00:02:08.020> and<00:02:08.880> twirl<00:02:09.880> and<00:02:10.509> I'm<00:02:11.470> going

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
choose distort and twirl and I'm going

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.440 
choose distort and twirl and I'm going
to<00:02:11.800> set<00:02:12.010> this<00:02:12.160> one<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:12.760> plus<00:02:13.120> 80<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:15.450> we'll

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
to set this one to plus 80 and we'll

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.520 
to set this one to plus 80 and we'll
okay<00:02:16.750> that<00:02:17.610> will<00:02:18.610> then<00:02:18.790> go<00:02:19.000> back<00:02:19.270> to<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:20.080> new

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
okay that will then go back to the new

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.620 
okay that will then go back to the new
layer<00:02:20.739> that<00:02:20.770> we<00:02:21.010> created<00:02:21.400> let's<00:02:22.209> just<00:02:22.450> turn

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
layer that we created let's just turn

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.680 
layer that we created let's just turn
that<00:02:22.660> one<00:02:22.930> on<00:02:24.000> filter<00:02:25.349> distort<00:02:26.730> 12<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:28.000> this

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
that one on filter distort 12 and this

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.690 
that one on filter distort 12 and this
time<00:02:28.900> instead<00:02:29.080> of<00:02:29.230> being<00:02:29.290> plus<00:02:29.650> 80<00:02:29.920> we're

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
time instead of being plus 80 we're

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.910 
time instead of being plus 80 we're
going<00:02:30.850> to<00:02:30.910> do<00:02:31.030> minus<00:02:31.570> 80<00:02:31.810> so<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.290> opposite<00:02:32.740> to

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
going to do minus 80 so the opposite to

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.960 
going to do minus 80 so the opposite to
what<00:02:32.950> we<00:02:33.250> had

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
what we had
