00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.419 

all<00:00:00.930> right<00:00:01.199> so<00:00:01.560> this<00:00:01.800> is<00:00:01.949> gonna<00:00:02.070> be<00:00:02.159> my

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
all right so this is gonna be my

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.579 
all right so this is gonna be my
mechanical<00:00:03.120> explanation<00:00:03.360> for<00:00:04.230> those<00:00:04.350> of<00:00:04.500> you

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
mechanical explanation for those of you

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:05.660 
mechanical explanation for those of you
who<00:00:04.710> want<00:00:04.890> to<00:00:04.950> try<00:00:05.130> and<00:00:05.220> build<00:00:05.370> something

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
who want to try and build something

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.990 
who want to try and build something
similar<00:00:06.210> to<00:00:06.450> this<00:00:07.550> first<00:00:08.550> off<00:00:08.730> we're<00:00:08.910> gonna

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
similar to this first off we're gonna

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.850 
similar to this first off we're gonna
start<00:00:09.330> going<00:00:09.480> through<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:10.019> run<00:00:10.200> mechanism

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
start going through the run mechanism

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.339 
start going through the run mechanism
what<00:00:11.070> makes<00:00:11.250> it<00:00:11.460> actually<00:00:12.210> work<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:12.630> then

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
what makes it actually work and then

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.320 
what makes it actually work and then
we'll<00:00:13.530> talk<00:00:13.650> about<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:14.009> programming<00:00:14.519> when<00:00:15.210> we

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
we'll talk about the programming when we

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.230 
we'll talk about the programming when we
get<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.830> so<00:00:16.830> first<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.580> run<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:18.090> you

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
get to that so first in the run is you

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.640 
get to that so first in the run is you
press<00:00:18.420> down<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.720> bar<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:19.170> turn<00:00:19.380> this<00:00:19.470> half

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
press down the bar you turn this half

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.470 
press down the bar you turn this half
way<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:20.310> let<00:00:20.490> go<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.789> bar<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.180> turn<00:00:21.359> it

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
way you let go the bar and you turn it

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.160 
way you let go the bar and you turn it
the<00:00:21.539> rest<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.900> way

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
the rest of the way

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.990 
the rest of the way
now<00:00:22.439> each<00:00:22.619> step<00:00:22.920> in<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.189> very<00:00:23.519> important

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
now each step in that is very important

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.370 
now each step in that is very important
now<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.060> first<00:00:27.420> step<00:00:27.570> pressing<00:00:27.990> up<00:00:28.140> on<00:00:28.260> the

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
now the first step pressing up on the

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.870 
now the first step pressing up on the
bar<00:00:28.560> really<00:00:29.039> only<00:00:29.369> does<00:00:29.550> one<00:00:29.849> thing

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
bar really only does one thing

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.089 
bar really only does one thing
throughout<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.869> whole<00:00:31.019> machine<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:32.070> see

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
throughout the whole machine you see

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.709 
throughout the whole machine you see
these<00:00:32.399> yellow<00:00:32.579> bars<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.120> are<00:00:33.149> going<00:00:33.450> up<00:00:33.570> down

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
these yellow bars that are going up down

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.479 
these yellow bars that are going up down
here<00:00:33.989> they're<00:00:34.410> connected<00:00:34.829> by<00:00:34.920> rubber<00:00:35.190> bands

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
here they're connected by rubber bands

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.190 
here they're connected by rubber bands
to<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:35.969> bar<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.480> when<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.780> bar<00:00:36.960> goes<00:00:37.170> up

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
to that bar so that when the bar goes up

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.130 
to that bar so that when the bar goes up
these<00:00:37.559> go<00:00:37.770> up<00:00:38.390> now<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.570> has<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.840> be<00:00:39.960> rubber

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
these go up now it has to be rubber

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.470 
these go up now it has to be rubber
bands<00:00:40.410> because<00:00:41.010> or<00:00:41.340> something<00:00:42.000> like<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.149> I

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
bands because or something like that I

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.580 
bands because or something like that I
know<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.750> could<00:00:42.960> do<00:00:43.050> something<00:00:43.230> different

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
know you could do something different

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.430 
know you could do something different
but<00:00:44.600> sometimes<00:00:45.600> they<00:00:45.750> have<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.020> stay<00:00:46.230> down

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
but sometimes they have to stay down

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.319 
but sometimes they have to stay down
while<00:00:46.710> all<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.950> others<00:00:47.190> still<00:00:47.460> go<00:00:47.579> up<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:47.969> fact

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
while all the others still go up in fact

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.029 
while all the others still go up in fact
all<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.750> them<00:00:49.020> are<00:00:49.140> gonna<00:00:49.230> be<00:00:49.410> down<00:00:49.559> sometimes

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
all of them are gonna be down sometimes

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.580 
all of them are gonna be down sometimes
or<00:00:50.309> just<00:00:50.670> one<00:00:50.820> will<00:00:50.969> be<00:00:51.059> up<00:00:54.199> now<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.379> entire

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
or just one will be up now this entire

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.500 
or just one will be up now this entire
machine<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.280> based<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.730> if<00:00:56.940> statements

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
machine is based on if statements

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.090 
machine is based on if statements
according<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.050> these<00:00:58.140> yellow<00:00:58.559> sticks<00:00:58.859> down

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
according to these yellow sticks down

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.910 
according to these yellow sticks down
here<00:00:59.340> if<00:00:59.730> it<00:01:00.210> goes<00:01:00.239> up<00:01:00.690> it'll<00:01:01.320> push<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.649> gray

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
here if it goes up it'll push this gray

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.130 
here if it goes up it'll push this gray
stick<00:01:02.190> up<00:01:02.370> which<00:01:02.879> then<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.449> pushed<00:01:03.750> over<00:01:04.110> by

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
stick up which then is pushed over by

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.750 
stick up which then is pushed over by
the<00:01:04.379> run<00:01:04.710> mechanism<00:01:05.600> which<00:01:06.600> moves<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.200> bits

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
the run mechanism which moves the bits

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.200 
the run mechanism which moves the bits
in<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:09.540> case<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.140> if<00:01:10.290> statement<00:01:10.799> is

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
in this case the if statement is

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.370 
in this case the if statement is
determined<00:01:12.210> by<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.330> grey<00:01:12.630> peg<00:01:12.900> down<00:01:13.140> here

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
determined by this grey peg down here

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.700 
determined by this grey peg down here
when<00:01:14.340> it's<00:01:14.490> set<00:01:14.670> when<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.000> machine<00:01:15.299> has<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:16.290> at

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
when it's set when the machine has a at

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.550 
when it's set when the machine has a at
zero<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:18.180> yellow<00:01:18.360> peg<00:01:18.630> can't<00:01:18.930> go<00:01:19.049> up<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.470> it

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
zero the yellow peg can't go up so it

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.899 
zero the yellow peg can't go up so it
doesn't<00:01:19.590> push<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.070> gray<00:01:20.250> thing<00:01:20.460> which<00:01:20.640> won't

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
doesn't push the gray thing which won't

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.990 
doesn't push the gray thing which won't
push<00:01:21.450> these<00:01:21.689> orange<00:01:22.020> pegs<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.470> top<00:01:22.729> but<00:01:23.729> if<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
push these orange pegs on top but if the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.600 
push these orange pegs on top but if the
machine<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.509> one<00:01:25.170> for<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.530> then<00:01:26.400> this

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
machine is that one for a then this

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.429 
machine is that one for a then this
orange<00:01:26.759> thing<00:01:27.030> can<00:01:27.150> go<00:01:27.270> up<00:01:27.390> which<00:01:27.600> will<00:01:27.840> push<00:01:28.170> a

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
orange thing can go up which will push a

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.359 
orange thing can go up which will push a
and<00:01:29.280> C<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:30.030> zero<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.320> if<00:01:31.530> statement<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:32.100> if

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
and C to zero so this if statement is if

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.450 
and C to zero so this if statement is if
a<00:01:33.000> equals<00:01:33.540> one<00:01:34.530> then<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.610> C<00:01:35.759> equals<00:01:36.090> zero

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
a equals one then a and C equals zero

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.039 
a equals one then a and C equals zero
all<00:01:38.460> right<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.000> I've<00:01:39.210> changed<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:39.689> program

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
all right so I've changed this program

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.140 
all right so I've changed this program
around<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.470> bit<00:01:40.680> it's<00:01:41.340> got<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.610> same<00:01:41.790> thing<00:01:42.000> on

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
around a bit it's got the same thing on

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.810 
around a bit it's got the same thing on
this<00:01:42.299> first<00:01:42.509> one<00:01:43.100> except<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.189> took<00:01:44.340> off<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.640> C

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
this first one except I took off the C

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.980 
this first one except I took off the C
part<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.540> if<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.899> equals<00:01:46.409> one<00:01:47.360> then<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.540> pushes<00:01:48.720> a

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
part so if a equals one then it pushes a

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.020 
part so if a equals one then it pushes a
to<00:01:49.049> zero<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.430> other<00:01:50.700> side

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
to zero but on this other side

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.590 
to zero but on this other side
I<00:01:51.299> also<00:01:51.869> added<00:01:52.200> another<00:01:52.799> part<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.329> if<00:01:54.420> a

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
I also added another part so that if a

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.350 
I also added another part so that if a
equals<00:01:54.869> zero<00:01:55.110> pushes<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.280> one<00:01:56.549> so<00:01:57.030> every

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
equals zero pushes a to one so every

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.730 
equals zero pushes a to one so every
time<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.600> run<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:57.990> program<00:01:58.380> it's<00:01:58.590> going<00:01:58.649> to

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
time I run this program it's going to

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.389 
time I run this program it's going to
switch<00:01:59.009> back<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.219> forth<00:02:01.009> notice<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.189> on

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
switch back and forth notice that on

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.030 
switch back and forth notice that on
this<00:02:02.700> side<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.119> gray<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.390> blocking<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.259> on

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
this side the gray is blocking it and on

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.910 
this side the gray is blocking it and on
this<00:02:05.189> side<00:02:05.430> it's<00:02:05.670> allowing<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.270> go<00:02:06.479> up<00:02:06.920> now

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
this side it's allowing it to go up now

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.400 
this side it's allowing it to go up now
this<00:02:08.429> brings<00:02:08.640> about<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:09.000> very<00:02:09.450> important<00:02:10.200> thing

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
this brings about a very important thing

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.880 
this brings about a very important thing
is<00:02:11.340> when<00:02:11.640> this<00:02:11.849> yellow<00:02:12.510> stick<00:02:12.780> goes<00:02:13.020> up

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
is when this yellow stick goes up

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.610 
is when this yellow stick goes up
you<00:02:14.460> can't<00:02:14.760> let<00:02:15.150> this<00:02:15.360> gray<00:02:15.690> part<00:02:16.020> go<00:02:16.230> over

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
you can't let this gray part go over

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.140 
you can't let this gray part go over
well<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.010> yellow<00:02:17.190> is<00:02:17.460> up<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:17.910> was<00:02:18.030> the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
well the yellow is up that was the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.430 
well the yellow is up that was the
biggest<00:02:18.480> problem<00:02:18.600> in<00:02:18.810> building<00:02:19.110> this<00:02:19.230> thing

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
biggest problem in building this thing

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.470 
biggest problem in building this thing
is<00:02:19.620> that<00:02:20.250> something<00:02:20.610> has<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.760> hold<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.270> gray

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
is that something has to hold the gray

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.630 
is that something has to hold the gray
up<00:02:21.660> while<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:22.319> let<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.650> yellow<00:02:22.920> go<00:02:23.100> down<00:02:23.340> and

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
up while you let the yellow go down and

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.970 
up while you let the yellow go down and
then<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.120> pushes<00:02:24.510> if<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:25.230> don't<00:02:25.530> do<00:02:25.770> that

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
then it pushes if you don't do that

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.370 
then it pushes if you don't do that
watch<00:02:26.910> what<00:02:27.120> happens<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.600> this<00:02:27.690> gray<00:02:27.930> stick<00:02:28.200> as

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
watch what happens to this gray stick as

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.310 
watch what happens to this gray stick as
they<00:02:28.620> get<00:02:28.800> as<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.220> owner<00:02:29.370> as<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:30.330> sorry<00:02:31.140> what

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
they get as the owner as the sorry what

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.900 
they get as the owner as the sorry what
watch<00:02:31.560> what<00:02:31.770> happens<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.190> this<00:02:32.280> yellow<00:02:32.640> stick

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
watch what happens to this yellow stick

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.660 
watch what happens to this yellow stick
as<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.180> gray<00:02:33.360> pushes<00:02:33.750> over<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.680> gray<00:02:34.920> the

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
as the gray pushes over the gray the

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.600 
as the gray pushes over the gray the
yellow<00:02:35.910> stick<00:02:36.209> will<00:02:36.360> push<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.720> gray<00:02:36.900> thing

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
yellow stick will push the gray thing

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.310 
yellow stick will push the gray thing
messing<00:02:38.610> up<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.850> entire<00:02:39.150> machine<00:02:39.330> so<00:02:40.140> that

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
messing up the entire machine so that

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.100 
messing up the entire machine so that
this<00:02:40.440> can't<00:02:40.709> toggle<00:02:41.040> back<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.220> forth<00:02:41.400> anymore

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.650 

and<00:02:46.190> that's<00:02:47.190> exactly<00:02:47.610> why<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.000> had<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.420> do<00:02:48.630> a

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
and that's exactly why I had to do a

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.990 
and that's exactly why I had to do a
full<00:02:48.989> motion<00:02:49.170> run<00:02:49.590> routine<00:02:50.400> which<00:02:50.970> is

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
full motion run routine which is

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.340 
full motion run routine which is
pressing<00:02:51.420> down<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.570> bar<00:02:51.810> moving<00:02:52.110> this<00:02:52.170> half

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
pressing down the bar moving this half

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.020 
pressing down the bar moving this half
way<00:02:52.560> then<00:02:52.769> letting<00:02:53.190> go<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.489> pushing<00:02:53.820> at<00:02:53.940> the

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
way then letting go and pushing at the

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.870 
way then letting go and pushing at the
rest<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:54.800> you<00:02:55.800> can<00:02:55.950> see<00:02:56.130> that<00:02:56.280> clearly<00:02:56.610> when

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
rest and you can see that clearly when

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.350 
rest and you can see that clearly when
we<00:02:56.940> look<00:02:57.180> at<00:02:57.269> this<00:02:57.420> first<00:02:57.720> part<00:02:57.989> again<00:02:59.330> in<00:03:00.330> a

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
we look at this first part again in a

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.430 
we look at this first part again in a
bit<00:03:02.360> well<00:03:03.360> first<00:03:03.570> off<00:03:03.690> here's<00:03:03.959> that<00:03:04.080> bar<00:03:04.290> we

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
bit well first off here's that bar we

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.440 
bit well first off here's that bar we
were<00:03:04.560> just<00:03:04.709> looking<00:03:04.830> at<00:03:05.040> back<00:03:05.250> here<00:03:05.519> should<00:03:06.330> be

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
were just looking at back here should be

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.170 
were just looking at back here should be
able<00:03:06.510> to<00:03:06.630> move<00:03:06.750> back<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:06.959> forth<00:03:07.320> yeah<00:03:07.560> and

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
able to move back and forth yeah and

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.870 
able to move back and forth yeah and
right<00:03:09.180> up<00:03:09.330> front<00:03:09.600> here<00:03:09.720> is<00:03:10.410> what<00:03:11.310> happens<00:03:11.670> when

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
right up front here is what happens when

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.759 
right up front here is what happens when
I<00:03:11.910> turn<00:03:12.330> this<00:03:12.540> run<00:03:12.840> thing<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.200> whole<00:03:13.410> way<00:03:13.560> over

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
I turn this run thing the whole way over

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.970 
I turn this run thing the whole way over
on<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.310> on<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:15.000> right<00:03:15.180> side<00:03:15.530> you<00:03:16.530> can<00:03:16.560> see<00:03:16.860> it

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
on the on the right side you can see it

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.890 
on the on the right side you can see it
it<00:03:17.790> has<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.030> little<00:03:18.239> peg<00:03:18.480> here<00:03:18.630> that<00:03:18.780> would

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
it has a little peg here that would

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.330 
it has a little peg here that would
catch<00:03:19.110> on<00:03:19.260> to<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.530> gray<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:19.890> push<00:03:20.070> it<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.310> the

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
catch on to the gray and push it to the

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.380 
catch on to the gray and push it to the
center<00:03:20.780> so<00:03:21.780> when<00:03:21.959> I<00:03:21.989> run<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.470> I<00:03:22.620> push<00:03:22.920> down<00:03:22.950> that

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
center so when I run it I push down that

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.110 
center so when I run it I push down that
turn<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.570> run<00:03:24.780> thing<00:03:25.470> half<00:03:25.799> way<00:03:26.070> instead<00:03:26.549> just

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
turn the run thing half way instead just

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.640 
turn the run thing half way instead just
so<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:27.390> peg<00:03:27.600> is<00:03:27.720> touching<00:03:28.140> gray<00:03:28.380> so<00:03:28.620> that

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
so the peg is touching gray so that

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.430 
so the peg is touching gray so that
doesn't<00:03:29.100> allow<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.310> gray<00:03:29.579> to<00:03:29.640> drop<00:03:30.110> we<00:03:31.110> the

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
doesn't allow the gray to drop we the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.360 
doesn't allow the gray to drop we the
yellow<00:03:31.620> thing<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:32.040> back<00:03:32.220> does<00:03:32.519> drop<00:03:33.829> this<00:03:34.829> it

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
yellow thing the back does drop this it

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.000 
yellow thing the back does drop this it
was<00:03:35.610> up<00:03:37.430> so<00:03:38.430> when<00:03:39.329> I<00:03:39.360> run<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:39.810> it<00:03:40.530> catches<00:03:40.769> the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
was up so when I run it it catches the

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.920 
was up so when I run it it catches the
grain<00:03:41.220> allows<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:41.610> yellow<00:03:41.820> to<00:03:42.030> drop<00:03:42.239> so<00:03:42.780> that

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
grain allows the yellow to drop so that

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.600 
grain allows the yellow to drop so that
the<00:03:43.049> gray<00:03:43.230> can<00:03:43.410> push<00:03:43.590> over<00:03:43.890> without<00:03:44.250> catching

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
the gray can push over without catching

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.400 
the gray can push over without catching
the<00:03:44.910> yellow<00:03:45.209> on<00:03:45.390> that<00:03:45.570> gray<00:03:45.750> peg<00:03:45.989> back<00:03:46.200> there

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
the yellow on that gray peg back there

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.890 
the yellow on that gray peg back there
and<00:03:46.890> here<00:03:47.760> we're<00:03:47.910> just<00:03:47.940> taking<00:03:48.180> a<00:03:48.450> quick<00:03:48.600> look

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
and here we're just taking a quick look

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.900 
and here we're just taking a quick look
at<00:03:49.049> the<00:03:49.170> relationship<00:03:49.799> between<00:03:49.829> the<00:03:50.310> gray<00:03:50.610> and

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
at the relationship between the gray and

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.180 
at the relationship between the gray and
the<00:03:51.120> yellow<00:03:51.390> sticks<00:03:51.720> if<00:03:52.470> I<00:03:52.680> push<00:03:52.890> up<00:03:52.920> the

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
the yellow sticks if I push up the

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.250 
the yellow sticks if I push up the
yellow<00:03:53.400> stick<00:03:53.700> from<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:53.910> back<00:03:54.150> you<00:03:54.810> can<00:03:54.959> see

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
yellow stick from the back you can see

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.770 
yellow stick from the back you can see
that<00:03:55.500> it<00:03:55.620> it<00:03:56.370> raises<00:03:56.910> this<00:03:57.090> blue<00:03:57.329> stick<00:03:57.600> by

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
that it it raises this blue stick by

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.830 
that it it raises this blue stick by
hinge<00:03:58.140> here<00:03:58.760> which<00:03:59.760> in<00:03:59.970> turn<00:04:00.150> pushes<00:04:00.420> up<00:04:00.690> the

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
hinge here which in turn pushes up the

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.780 
hinge here which in turn pushes up the
gray<00:04:01.019> so<00:04:01.320> that<00:04:01.470> when<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.739> gray<00:04:02.010> is<00:04:02.250> held<00:04:02.549> up

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
gray so that when the gray is held up

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.990 
gray so that when the gray is held up
the<00:04:03.180> yellow<00:04:03.329> can<00:04:03.660> still<00:04:03.870> drop<00:04:04.079> back<00:04:04.320> down

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
the yellow can still drop back down

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.400 
the yellow can still drop back down
that's<00:04:06.000> really<00:04:06.360> important<00:04:06.780> because<00:04:06.870> if<00:04:07.140> they

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
that's really important because if they

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.860 
that's really important because if they
were<00:04:07.470> actually<00:04:07.950> connected<00:04:08.579> then<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:09.510> gray

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
were actually connected then the gray

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.120 
were actually connected then the gray
wouldn't<00:04:10.170> I<00:04:10.260> mean<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.560> yellow<00:04:10.709> wouldn't<00:04:11.070> be

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
wouldn't I mean the yellow wouldn't be

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.410 
wouldn't I mean the yellow wouldn't be
able<00:04:11.280> to<00:04:11.340> drop<00:04:11.549> back<00:04:11.760> down<00:04:11.940> while<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.269> gray

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
able to drop back down while the gray

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.150 
able to drop back down while the gray
stayed<00:04:12.720> up<00:04:12.870> this<00:04:13.500> was<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:13.769> hardest<00:04:14.040> part

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
stayed up this was the hardest part

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.670 
stayed up this was the hardest part
about<00:04:14.459> building<00:04:14.790> it<00:04:15.079> and<00:04:16.079> it<00:04:16.229> takes<00:04:16.440> up<00:04:16.590> the

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
about building it and it takes up the

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.610 
about building it and it takes up the
most<00:04:16.859> room<00:04:17.160> so<00:04:17.910> if<00:04:18.690> anyone<00:04:19.140> could<00:04:19.229> find<00:04:19.380> a<00:04:19.500> way

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
most room so if anyone could find a way

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.170 
most room so if anyone could find a way
to<00:04:19.650> get<00:04:19.859> rid<00:04:20.039> of<00:04:20.070> that<00:04:20.310> he<00:04:20.489> would<00:04:20.640> definitely

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
to get rid of that he would definitely

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.909 
to get rid of that he would definitely
make<00:04:21.570> this<00:04:21.720> thing<00:04:21.900> a<00:04:21.989> lot<00:04:22.080> smaller

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
make this thing a lot smaller

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.649 
make this thing a lot smaller
one<00:04:24.919> major<00:04:25.069> weakness<00:04:25.400> of<00:04:25.759> the<00:04:25.909> digicomp<00:04:26.360> is

00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:26.659 
one major weakness of the digicomp is

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:28.390 
one major weakness of the digicomp is
that<00:04:26.840> each<00:04:27.020> side<00:04:27.319> of<00:04:27.470> the<00:04:27.560> major<00:04:27.770> logic<00:04:28.220> gates

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
that each side of the major logic gates

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.760 
that each side of the major logic gates
can<00:04:28.729> only<00:04:28.879> return<00:04:29.240> one<00:04:29.810> number<00:04:30.139> for<00:04:30.710> example

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
can only return one number for example

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.040 
can only return one number for example
this<00:04:31.490> side<00:04:31.699> can<00:04:31.849> only<00:04:32.000> return<00:04:32.360> a<00:04:32.419> one<00:04:32.690> this

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
this side can only return a one this

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.890 
this side can only return a one this
side<00:04:33.289> of<00:04:33.470> zero<00:04:33.680> I'm<00:04:34.610> sorry<00:04:34.879> this<00:04:35.389> side<00:04:35.599> of<00:04:35.720> 1

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
side of zero I'm sorry this side of 1

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.110 
side of zero I'm sorry this side of 1
this<00:04:36.139> side<00:04:36.289> of<00:04:36.440> zero<00:04:36.650> decided<00:04:37.490> 1<00:04:37.639> this<00:04:37.819> side<00:04:37.970> of

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
this side of zero decided 1 this side of

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.909 
this side of zero decided 1 this side of
zero<00:04:38.300> this<00:04:38.960> side<00:04:39.169> of<00:04:39.289> one<00:04:39.409> on<00:04:39.530> that<00:04:39.620> side<00:04:39.889> of

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
zero this side of one on that side of

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.300 
zero this side of one on that side of
zero<00:04:40.659> so<00:04:41.659> in<00:04:42.080> order<00:04:42.440> to<00:04:42.590> compensate<00:04:42.770> for<00:04:43.250> that

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
zero so in order to compensate for that

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.200 
zero so in order to compensate for that
that<00:04:43.819> digicomp<00:04:44.240> maker<00:04:45.280> made<00:04:46.280> a<00:04:46.310> mechanical<00:04:47.060> or

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
that digicomp maker made a mechanical or

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.149 
that digicomp maker made a mechanical or
gate<00:04:47.470> instead<00:04:48.470> of<00:04:48.560> using<00:04:48.710> two<00:04:48.979> of<00:04:49.069> these

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:49.159 
gate instead of using two of these

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:51.670 
gate instead of using two of these
you're<00:04:49.639> gonna<00:04:49.759> use<00:04:49.940> one<00:04:50.120> of<00:04:50.150> these<00:04:50.650> so<00:04:51.650> i

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
you're gonna use one of these so i

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.529 
you're gonna use one of these so i
actually<00:04:52.099> replicated<00:04:52.879> that<00:04:52.970> and<00:04:53.180> connects

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
actually replicated that and connects

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:55.270 
actually replicated that and connects
and<00:04:53.780> if<00:04:54.319> you<00:04:54.440> can<00:04:54.560> see<00:04:54.740> there<00:04:54.889> in<00:04:54.979> the<00:04:55.009> center

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
and if you can see there in the center

and if you can see there in the center
that<00:04:55.550> blue<00:04:56.270> stick<00:04:56.690> right<00:04:56.930> there<00:04:58.210> if<00:04:59.210> I<00:04:59.419> raise

the yellow stick on the left side it

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:04.899 
the yellow stick on the left side it
will<00:05:03.440> raise<00:05:03.620> the<00:05:03.650> gray<00:05:04.069> stick<00:05:04.370> on<00:05:04.610> the<00:05:04.699> right

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:04.909 
will raise the gray stick on the right

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:06.999 
will raise the gray stick on the right
side<00:05:05.150> if<00:05:05.780> I<00:05:05.960> raise<00:05:06.139> the<00:05:06.169> yellow<00:05:06.530> stick<00:05:06.770> on<00:05:06.919> the

side if I raise the yellow stick on the
right<00:05:07.219> side<00:05:07.460> it'll<00:05:07.669> also<00:05:07.909> raise<00:05:08.270> the<00:05:08.300> great

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
right side it'll also raise the great

stick on the right side I'm sorry I have

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.790 
stick on the right side I'm sorry I have

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
an if statement in here there so either

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.939 
an if statement in here there so either
when<00:05:16.039> I<00:05:16.069> raise<00:05:16.430> it's<00:05:17.210> gonna<00:05:17.530> raise<00:05:18.530> the<00:05:18.740> great

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949
