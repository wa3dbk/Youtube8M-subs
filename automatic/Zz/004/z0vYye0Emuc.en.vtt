00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.660
 shocks and water set carols are of course always nice to put on 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.150
 sensitive record they also come out more and more for the simple reason of 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.480
 ready to distinguish another and measure olympus with this 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.490
 pk and 630 at least on the anp a lover with the wallet 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.480
 this compact device currently costs around 170 euros 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.619
 and I give arms full of praise to fall along or swim nicely to 5 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:31.499
 meters deep 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:35.050
 In addition, it has five times optical zoom and can hold film 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.580
 The proof that is just doing securitas internationally 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.890
 8 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.340
 sag 8 ak 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.499
 it all so 

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:44.860
 suggest housing 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.370
 nice and compact yet strong 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.160
 well that is a player is also right to see that all connections or 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.810
 for example, the place where you have to put your SD card 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.730
 part hidden behind type of covers that can now close or close again 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.020
 lure if you want 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.760
 cleverly done by not playing in the dirt or other substances 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.860
 water cycle 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.130
 but also cleverly done and singing the controls you also do through one 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.310
 specially he needs you on the side 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.380
 you can easily navigate through all lines is really fast 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.600
 as far as I'm concerned that in a more rooms countervalue the I found really really bad 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.690
 handy 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.400
 in terms of special options, efteling is of course the well-done number of 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.870
 nice girl I learn a lot of markers 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.130
 funny is an example fragmented and backlit but also help aqua 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.640
 then the union makes a big picture of my cameraman that everybody wants 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.080
 special is also the super macro mode, which means you can also have a whole thickness 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.979
 still sharpen close up I even have a little blur in the 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:41.520
 background that is always nice 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.280
 but just look at the rest of the image quality then it falls on that during the day 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.170
 this camera more than performs well, but in the evening you quickly become one 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.640
 less video mode is unfortunately not too great it is a bit jerky 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.180
 all of them 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.630
 if you want to see the first jobs of your child that pennies, then you can 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.250
 naturally fine 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.610
 the olympus screen it off eg 6 of the third son previously has quality and 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.000
 a remarkably good viewing angle 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.830
 and the operation of this whole room strong quite quickly by that you do 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.830
 actually all through the operation 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:11.759
 at the right 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:16.099
 actually you can followill in the stylist pg 36 say it's gone 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.829
 very solid water and shock-resistant a camera 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.590
 when afterwards for the camera breeding on holiday then this is your buy and there 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:25.589
 you also get some nonsense three dropped sharply and I hope this
