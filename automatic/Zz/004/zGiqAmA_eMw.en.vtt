1920s that incredible time when there

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.899 
1920s that incredible time when there
was<00:01:10.530> an<00:01:10.650> enormous<00:01:10.950> innovation<00:01:11.729> and

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
was an enormous innovation and

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.880 
was an enormous innovation and
creativity<00:01:12.270> kestrels<00:01:13.260> basically

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
of the project and of course as you know

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.300 
of the project and of course as you know
though<00:01:18.320> Castro<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.409> now<00:01:19.560> introducing<00:01:20.070> very

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
though Castro is now introducing very

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.280 
though Castro is now introducing very
superior<00:01:20.759> technology<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.689> new<00:01:21.840> titanium

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
superior technology the new titanium

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.130 
superior technology the new titanium
products<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.159> that's<00:01:24.030> fits<00:01:24.689> very<00:01:24.869> nicely

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
products and that's fits very nicely

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.660 
products and that's fits very nicely
with<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.680> hand<00:01:25.920> because<00:01:26.189> we're<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.430> land

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
with that hand because we're a land

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.280 
with that hand because we're a land
speed<00:01:26.939> record<00:01:27.270> car<00:01:27.479> we've<00:01:27.689> got<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.020> get<00:01:28.170> the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
speed record car we've got to get the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.319 
speed record car we've got to get the
high<00:01:28.470> sparta<00:01:29.070> weight<00:01:29.220> ratios<00:01:29.670> we<00:01:29.939> possibly

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
high sparta weight ratios we possibly

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.390 
high sparta weight ratios we possibly
can<00:01:30.600> we've<00:01:30.840> got<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.079> build<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.380> car<00:01:31.619> as<00:01:31.829> light

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
can we've got to build the car as light

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.370 
can we've got to build the car as light
as<00:01:32.640> we<00:01:32.790> can<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.270> yet<00:01:33.420> maintain<00:01:33.600> its<00:01:33.990> strengths

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
as we can and yet maintain its strengths

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.840 
as we can and yet maintain its strengths
and<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:34.619> there's<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> lot<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.040> titanium<00:01:35.610> in<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
and so there's a lot of titanium in the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.149 
and so there's a lot of titanium in the
car<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:36.869> great<00:01:37.350> relationship<00:01:37.979> between

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
car so that great relationship between

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.420 
car so that great relationship between
titanium<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.060> lubricant<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.689> and

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
titanium in the lubricant and and

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.520 
titanium in the lubricant and and
titanium<00:01:41.430> in<00:01:41.640> blood<00:01:41.909> hand<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.659> very<00:01:42.990> very<00:01:43.320> apt

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
titanium in blood hand is very very apt

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.920 
titanium in blood hand is very very apt
and<00:01:43.770> very<00:01:44.100> valuable

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
and very valuable

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.660 
and very valuable
here<00:01:46.560> at<00:01:46.650> bloodhound<00:01:47.070> we've<00:01:47.220> got<00:01:47.370> a<00:01:47.400> little

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
here at bloodhound we've got a little

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.950 
here at bloodhound we've got a little
team<00:01:47.850> we<00:01:48.090> try<00:01:48.330> and<00:01:48.450> keep<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.840> organization

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
team we try and keep the organization

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.490 
team we try and keep the organization
very<00:01:49.710> small<00:01:50.130> very<00:01:50.700> important<00:01:51.210> then<00:01:51.500> because

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
very small very important then because

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.710

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
actually defined by the little group of

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.700 
actually defined by the little group of
people<00:01:59.100> who<00:01:59.280> started<00:01:59.790> this<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.510> so<00:02:01.380> we've<00:02:01.530> got

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
people who started this and so we've got

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.680 
people who started this and so we've got
basically<00:02:02.610> take<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:03.060> little<00:02:03.270> group<00:02:03.540> right

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
basically take this little group right

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.480 
basically take this little group right
from<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.080> beginning<00:02:04.470> right<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:05.340> way<00:02:05.460> through

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
from the beginning right the way through

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.210 
from the beginning right the way through
to<00:02:05.760> the<00:02:06.000> end<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.330> project<00:02:06.750> because<00:02:06.869> they

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
to the end of the project because they

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.760 
to the end of the project because they
represent<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.340> culture<00:02:08.899> if<00:02:09.899> basically<00:02:10.530> that

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
represent the culture if basically that

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.520 
represent the culture if basically that
group<00:02:11.009> were<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.370> change<00:02:12.030> or<00:02:12.240> be<00:02:12.390> changed<00:02:12.840> then

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
group were to change or be changed then

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.960 
group were to change or be changed then
effectively<00:02:14.100> we<00:02:14.250> would<00:02:14.520> have<00:02:14.640> lost<00:02:14.790> our

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
effectively we would have lost our

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.790 
effectively we would have lost our
culture<00:02:15.390> so<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.780> culture<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.260> very<00:02:16.530> very

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
culture so the culture is very very

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.500 
culture so the culture is very very
important<00:02:17.220> because<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.910> culture<00:02:18.239> of<00:02:18.330> course

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
important because the culture of course

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.630 
important because the culture of course
links<00:02:18.900> with<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.380> brand<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.340> course<00:02:20.489> what

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
links with the brand and of course what

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.800 
links with the brand and of course what
we've<00:02:20.760> got<00:02:20.880> to<00:02:20.970> do<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.180> push<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.510> boundaries

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
we've got to do is push the boundaries
