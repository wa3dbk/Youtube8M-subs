00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:09.910
 Hello. Naver Blog is a big spin. Now I am new to LG's ambitious new 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:14.110
 The new me I'm holding back a product in hand-to-many on this product 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:18.940
 In addition to the performance upgrade , 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:20.619
 There are a lot of other things, 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.640
 The food you are receiving 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:27.279
 Now I've multitasking capabilities that can be three fingers tasks slider 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.840
 I want to show you a feature called 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:34.070
 Previously, the 10 goes to when you and another buff you run the app so 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.210
 If you do 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:41.690
 For multi-disk size to go back to that example application button on the home this year 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:46.370
 I was able to do it by pressing the button when I was on the way. 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:51.530
 For example, with a lot of applications in use, 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:55.550
 If you are many pressing another industry that mark out the Home button Back 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:01:00.050
 Ma'am.Do forced to accept that inconvenience should find a yoreo 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:05.030
 Task 3, which makes multi-school tasking easier now, 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:09.830
 Here it is unusually think three fingers lifting the example of Naver pool Kindle 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:13.790
 With the next three fingers pushing from left to right 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:17.960
 You will see the phrase "Your app is stored on top of the station" 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.649
 Eve adjusted up to a total of three doeneundeyo look to save a different opinion once 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.100
 I'll do it. 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:24.100
 Two apps were saved and three 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:32.180
 There are three markets, but now it is said that the three stored 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:36.770
 Multi-tasking applications at once 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.580
 In order to use it easily , the left- right screen with three fingers 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.030
 Push out 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:44.479
 So, I 'm going to make three of these. 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:48.080
 If you just click again and n touch, 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:53.119
 And will also move 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:57.380
 But this doejyo unfortunate thing is that then the next one to end the current storage 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.460
 This is the first time you have a c rock test. 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.300
 It was. 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:06.350
 This part is why I see it in the knowledge of doing so badly. 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:11.870
 I have been constantly using the katok that I use frequently or what is Naver 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.190
 Or you can just re-run functions such as WebTuning just by collapsing 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.500
 I wish I could be here. 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:21.049
 After a normal storage and once ancestor 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.140
 When you call these, 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:29.060
 I know that disappear doejyo was now two days 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:33.170
 It 's good to have multitasking immediately and quickly, 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:38.180
 I do not think it's a bit of a hiccup to dispose of it. 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:41.540
 So I press the Home button and I can see right now the apps I love 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:47.570
 I want to show it on the second floor before use. 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:49.549
 After the air in the immediate layer but again some uses layers of repetitive 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.450
 I do not think it's a bad feature. 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:56.780
 Jundamyeon to update via an update in some ways now multi-tasking 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.440
 Common features available in the idea that would not think 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.239
 It's possible 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.239
 It was a big face in my company bubble.
