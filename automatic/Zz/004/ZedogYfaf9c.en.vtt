and<00:00:29.660> then<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:32.420> blow<00:00:33.420> dried<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.750> lightly<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.950> so

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
and then I blow dried it lightly just so

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.040 
and then I blow dried it lightly just so
that<00:00:35.670> can<00:00:35.850> get<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.120> little<00:00:36.270> crinkle<00:00:36.660> out<00:00:36.780> and

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
that can get that little crinkle out and

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.170 
that can get that little crinkle out and
to<00:00:37.260> give<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:39.559> smoother<00:00:40.559> look<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.100> guess<00:00:41.280> and
