even be able to use my 2b pencil if I am

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.370 
even be able to use my 2b pencil if I am
really<00:00:51.490> good<00:00:51.640> at<00:00:51.670> feathering<00:00:52.060> it<00:00:52.240> on<00:00:52.390> and<00:00:52.780> it

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
really good at feathering it on and it

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.260 
really good at feathering it on and it
will<00:00:53.560> help<00:00:53.770> me<00:00:53.920> increase<00:00:54.400> the<00:00:54.430> values<00:00:54.940> of<00:00:55.120> some

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
will help me increase the values of some

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.200 
will help me increase the values of some
of<00:00:55.390> these<00:00:55.450> areas<00:00:55.720> or<00:00:56.290> I<00:00:56.350> might<00:00:56.890> be<00:00:56.920> the<00:00:57.130> HP<00:00:57.610> as

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
of these areas or I might be the HP as

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.790 
of these areas or I might be the HP as
soon<00:00:58.450> as<00:00:58.570> you<00:00:58.660> start<00:00:58.900> putting<00:00:59.050> on<00:00:59.350> too<00:00:59.560> much

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
soon as you start putting on too much

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.760 
soon as you start putting on too much
back<00:01:00.520> up<00:01:00.790> and<00:01:01.000> use<00:01:01.660> the<00:01:01.900> appropriate<00:01:01.990> pencil

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
back up and use the appropriate pencil

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.310 
back up and use the appropriate pencil
if<00:01:03.220> you're<00:01:03.520> regulating<00:01:04.239> your<00:01:04.330> pressure<00:01:04.600> that

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
if you're regulating your pressure that

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.249 
if you're regulating your pressure that
pencil<00:01:05.979> is<00:01:06.159> going<00:01:06.460> to<00:01:06.640> help<00:01:06.969> you<00:01:07.259> achieve

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
pencil is going to help you achieve

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:10.469 
pencil is going to help you achieve
exactly<00:01:08.950> what<00:01:09.460> you<00:01:09.609> want<00:01:09.820> and<00:01:10.060> you'll<00:01:10.210> know

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
exactly what you want and you'll know

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.719 
exactly what you want and you'll know
what<00:01:10.630> to<00:01:10.810> expect<00:01:11.229> because<00:01:11.439> you<00:01:11.799> always<00:01:12.219> have<00:01:12.670> a

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
what to expect because you always have a

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.330 
what to expect because you always have a
regulated<00:01:13.359> pressure<00:01:13.600> but<00:01:14.530> you<00:01:14.799> will<00:01:15.039> be<00:01:15.219> able

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
regulated pressure but you will be able

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.279 
regulated pressure but you will be able
to<00:01:15.520> go<00:01:15.759> lighter<00:01:16.030> and<00:01:16.240> lighter<00:01:16.479> by<00:01:16.780> lessening

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
to go lighter and lighter by lessening

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:18.779 
to go lighter and lighter by lessening
the<00:01:17.409> pressure<00:01:17.619> but<00:01:17.890> there's<00:01:18.039> a<00:01:18.130> maximum

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
the pressure but there's a maximum

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:20.039 
the pressure but there's a maximum
amount<00:01:18.880> of<00:01:19.090> pressure<00:01:19.299> do<00:01:19.509> you<00:01:19.539> want<00:01:19.749> to<00:01:19.840> stick

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
amount of pressure do you want to stick

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.039 
amount of pressure do you want to stick
with<00:01:20.229> and<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.670> this<00:01:22.030> is<00:01:22.270> an<00:01:22.450> opportunity<00:01:22.960> for

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
with and and this is an opportunity for

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:28.770 
with and and this is an opportunity for
me<00:01:23.229> now<00:01:23.590> to<00:01:24.520> really<00:01:25.530> just<00:01:26.530> subtly<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:28.450> I<00:01:28.569> want

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
me now to really just subtly and I want

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.980 
me now to really just subtly and I want
to<00:01:28.840> be<00:01:28.899> patient<00:01:29.350> if<00:01:30.100> I'm<00:01:30.280> not<00:01:30.460> patient<00:01:30.999> I'm<00:01:31.719> not

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
to be patient if I'm not patient I'm not

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.200 
to be patient if I'm not patient I'm not
going<00:01:32.139> to<00:01:32.170> achieve<00:01:32.289> this<00:01:32.710> I<00:01:32.979> could<00:01:33.909> do<00:01:34.030> some

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
going to achieve this I could do some

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.149 
going to achieve this I could do some
more<00:01:34.420> things<00:01:34.780> with<00:01:34.960> this<00:01:35.170> but<00:01:35.649> this<00:01:35.770> is<00:01:35.950> also

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
more things with this but this is also

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.029 
more things with this but this is also
our<00:01:36.310> opportunity<00:01:37.090> to<00:01:37.539> not<00:01:37.719> only<00:01:37.990> increase<00:01:38.469> the

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
our opportunity to not only increase the

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:41.910 
our opportunity to not only increase the
value<00:01:39.069> in<00:01:39.789> a<00:01:39.880> few<00:01:40.060> places<00:01:40.210> to<00:01:41.109> refine<00:01:41.530> some<00:01:41.829> of

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
value in a few places to refine some of

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.559 
value in a few places to refine some of
the<00:01:41.979> spaces<00:01:42.549> and<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:42.789> little<00:01:43.119> pits<00:01:43.329> in<00:01:43.479> the

the spaces and the little pits in the
paper<00:01:43.780> whatever<00:01:44.350> it<00:01:44.619> happens<00:01:44.889> to<00:01:44.920> be<00:01:45.009> use<00:01:45.579> the

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
paper whatever it happens to be use the

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.279 
paper whatever it happens to be use the
appropriate<00:01:46.060> pencil<00:01:46.600> it's<00:01:46.719> very<00:01:46.929> possible

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
appropriate pencil it's very possible

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:48.989 
appropriate pencil it's very possible
that<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:47.829> 4-h<00:01:48.159> is<00:01:48.189> going<00:01:48.429> to<00:01:48.490> do<00:01:48.609> a<00:01:48.639> whole<00:01:48.789> lot

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:48.999 
that the 4-h is going to do a whole lot

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:51.959 
that the 4-h is going to do a whole lot
for<00:01:49.209> you<00:01:49.270> but<00:01:50.200> now<00:01:50.979> I<00:01:51.009> also<00:01:51.399> want<00:01:51.789> to<00:01:51.819> create

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:51.969 
for you but now I also want to create

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:54.660 
for you but now I also want to create
enough<00:01:52.299> contrast<00:01:52.840> so<00:01:53.530> when<00:01:53.770> I<00:01:53.799> come<00:01:54.159> back<00:01:54.369> in

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
enough contrast so when I come back in

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.749 
enough contrast so when I come back in
here<00:01:54.749> I'm<00:01:55.749> gonna<00:01:55.990> want<00:01:56.289> to<00:01:56.469> see<00:01:56.740> where<00:01:57.399> I<00:01:57.429> might

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
here I'm gonna want to see where I might

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.359 
here I'm gonna want to see where I might
need<00:01:57.999> to<00:01:58.119> clean<00:01:58.240> it<00:01:58.479> up<00:01:58.630> and<00:01:58.840> it<00:01:59.679> might<00:01:59.950> be<00:02:00.159> with

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
need to clean it up and it might be with

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.269 
need to clean it up and it might be with
this<00:02:00.600> eraser<00:02:01.600> here<00:02:01.959> when<00:02:02.529> I<00:02:02.560> use<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:02.979> point

00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:03.279 
this eraser here when I use the point

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:05.249 
this eraser here when I use the point
I'm<00:02:03.729> going<00:02:03.999> to<00:02:04.060> be<00:02:04.149> able<00:02:04.240> to<00:02:04.329> take<00:02:04.539> some<00:02:04.869> subtle

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
I'm going to be able to take some subtle

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.719 
I'm going to be able to take some subtle
little<00:02:05.350> value<00:02:05.829> that<00:02:06.009> might<00:02:06.219> have<00:02:06.340> been<00:02:06.459> cast

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
little value that might have been cast

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.359 
little value that might have been cast
in<00:02:06.999> there<00:02:07.209> and<00:02:07.420> I<00:02:08.289> can<00:02:08.560> go<00:02:08.709> ahead<00:02:08.740> and<00:02:08.979> brighten

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
in there and I can go ahead and brighten

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.570 
in there and I can go ahead and brighten
up<00:02:09.670> a<00:02:10.319> highlight<00:02:11.319> I<00:02:11.530> don't<00:02:11.950> want<00:02:12.099> to<00:02:12.189> take<00:02:12.400> it

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
up a highlight I don't want to take it

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.330 
up a highlight I don't want to take it
down<00:02:12.760> to<00:02:12.819> nothing

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
down to nothing

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.520 
down to nothing
you<00:02:13.519> just<00:02:13.730> have<00:02:13.910> plain<00:02:14.120> paper<00:02:14.530> because

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
you just have plain paper because

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.460 
you just have plain paper because
anything<00:02:16.310> that<00:02:16.519> has<00:02:16.670> nothing<00:02:17.090> in<00:02:17.480> it<00:02:17.599> is<00:02:18.110> going

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
anything that has nothing in it is going

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.530 
anything that has nothing in it is going
to<00:02:18.620> end<00:02:18.769> up<00:02:18.860> by<00:02:19.010> being<00:02:19.190> flat<00:02:19.489> it's<00:02:20.180> going<00:02:20.239> to<00:02:20.450> be

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
to end up by being flat it's going to be

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.449 
to end up by being flat it's going to be
just<00:02:20.870> as<00:02:21.050> flat<00:02:21.290> as<00:02:21.560> this<00:02:21.680> piece<00:02:21.890> of<00:02:22.010> paper<00:02:22.129> is

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
just as flat as this piece of paper is

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.280 
just as flat as this piece of paper is
because<00:02:23.150> there's<00:02:23.300> absolutely<00:02:23.690> no<00:02:23.810> value<00:02:24.140> on

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
because there's absolutely no value on

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.520 
because there's absolutely no value on
it<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:25.069> only<00:02:25.370> way<00:02:25.519> I<00:02:25.550> can<00:02:25.790> suggest<00:02:26.569> that<00:02:27.230> there

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
it the only way I can suggest that there

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.910 
it the only way I can suggest that there
is<00:02:27.830> a<00:02:28.629> contour<00:02:29.629> and<00:02:30.230> you<00:02:30.379> can<00:02:30.500> see<00:02:30.709> this

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
is a contour and you can see this

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.430 
is a contour and you can see this
happening<00:02:31.400> is<00:02:31.640> look<00:02:32.239> we<00:02:32.750> create<00:02:33.049> an<00:02:33.170> illusion

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
happening is look we create an illusion

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.680 
happening is look we create an illusion
and<00:02:33.799> look<00:02:34.340> at<00:02:34.489> that<00:02:34.670> wonderful<00:02:35.599> opportunity

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
and look at that wonderful opportunity

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.110 
and look at that wonderful opportunity
we<00:02:36.260> could<00:02:36.470> duplicate<00:02:37.099> this<00:02:37.310> and<00:02:37.370> give<00:02:37.790> us<00:02:37.940> an

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
we could duplicate this and give us an

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.600 
we could duplicate this and give us an
opportunity<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:38.720> see<00:02:39.049> you<00:02:39.739> know<00:02:40.190> what<00:02:40.459> the

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
opportunity to see you know what the

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.570 
opportunity to see you know what the
contour<00:02:41.060> is<00:02:41.150> by<00:02:41.360> adding<00:02:41.569> value<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:42.739> so<00:02:43.340> the

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
contour is by adding value to it so the

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.370 
contour is by adding value to it so the
value<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.209> farther<00:02:44.510> away<00:02:44.660> it<00:02:44.810> gets<00:02:45.019> from<00:02:45.349> the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
value the farther away it gets from the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.530 
value the farther away it gets from the
light<00:02:46.280> source<00:02:46.310> over<00:02:46.819> here<00:02:49.180> it's<00:02:50.180> going<00:02:50.329> to<00:02:50.390> get

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
light source over here it's going to get

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.210 
light source over here it's going to get
darker<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:50.959> darker<00:02:51.049> unless<00:02:51.620> there's<00:02:52.130> a

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
darker and darker unless there's a

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.089 
darker and darker unless there's a
secondary<00:02:52.700> light<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.269> so<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.650> brightest

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
secondary light and so the brightest

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:56.860 
secondary light and so the brightest
point<00:02:55.370> we<00:02:55.610> want<00:02:55.819> to<00:02:55.880> be<00:02:55.970> able<00:02:56.209> to<00:02:56.390> nail<00:02:56.630> that

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
point we want to be able to nail that

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.890 
point we want to be able to nail that
down<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:57.440> because<00:02:57.799> you'll<00:02:57.980> see<00:02:58.220> how<00:02:58.760> is<00:02:59.090> it

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
down to because you'll see how is it

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.280 
down to because you'll see how is it
goes<00:03:00.049> over<00:03:00.379> here<00:03:01.120> when<00:03:02.120> it's<00:03:02.269> curved<00:03:02.629> it<00:03:02.959> gets

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
goes over here when it's curved it gets

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.350 
goes over here when it's curved it gets
a<00:03:03.410> little<00:03:03.560> darker<00:03:03.980> again<00:03:04.310> not<00:03:04.879> as<00:03:05.090> dark

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
a little darker again not as dark

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.520 
a little darker again not as dark
because<00:03:05.629> it's<00:03:05.780> on<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:05.989> bright<00:03:06.170> side<00:03:06.200> of<00:03:06.410> the

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
because it's on the bright side of the

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.740 
because it's on the bright side of the
face<00:03:06.769> but<00:03:07.549> these<00:03:07.700> are<00:03:07.910> all<00:03:08.090> things<00:03:08.120> that<00:03:08.599> have

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
face but these are all things that have

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.990 
face but these are all things that have
consistent<00:03:09.440> principles<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:10.099> rules<00:03:10.190> that<00:03:10.879> we

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
consistent principles and rules that we

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.509 
consistent principles and rules that we
can<00:03:11.150> use<00:03:11.420> to<00:03:11.900> really<00:03:12.079> come<00:03:12.410> up<00:03:12.590> with<00:03:12.620> what<00:03:13.400> we

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
can use to really come up with what we

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:23.040 
can use to really come up with what we
