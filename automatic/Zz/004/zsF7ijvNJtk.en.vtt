so<00:00:07.150> here's<00:00:07.359> Kayla<00:00:07.810> using<00:00:08.139> a<00:00:08.200> makey<00:00:08.440> makey

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
so here's Kayla using a makey makey

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.459 
so here's Kayla using a makey makey
controlling<00:00:11.530> a<00:00:11.620> piano<00:00:12.450> from<00:00:13.450> that<00:00:13.900> paper<00:00:14.139> so

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:14.469 
controlling a piano from that paper so

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.049 
controlling a piano from that paper so
let's<00:00:14.710> take<00:00:14.860> a<00:00:14.889> look<00:00:15.070> here<00:00:15.309> we've<00:00:15.820> got<00:00:16.000> a

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.059 
let's take a look here we've got a

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.139 
let's take a look here we've got a
project<00:00:16.689> that<00:00:16.990> somebody<00:00:17.290> made<00:00:17.470> on<00:00:17.619> scratch

00:00:18.139 --> 00:00:18.149 
project that somebody made on scratch

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:20.280 
project that somebody made on scratch
it's<00:00:19.149> the<00:00:19.239> website<00:00:19.390> we've<00:00:19.720> been<00:00:19.840> using<00:00:19.989> for

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:20.290 
it's the website we've been using for

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.420 
it's the website we've been using for
coding<00:00:20.590> I'll<00:00:21.550> make<00:00:21.730> it<00:00:21.849> big<00:00:22.000> here<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:24.220> here's

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 
coding I'll make it big here so here's

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.460 
coding I'll make it big here so here's
the<00:00:24.579> piano<00:00:25.000> and<00:00:25.239> it's<00:00:26.110> controlled<00:00:26.649> by<00:00:28.470> the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
the piano and it's controlled by the

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.440 
the piano and it's controlled by the
makey<00:00:29.800> makey<00:00:29.829> so<00:00:30.399> we've<00:00:30.579> got<00:00:30.730> a<00:00:30.759> USB<00:00:31.059> cable

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:31.450 
makey makey so we've got a USB cable

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.080 
makey makey so we've got a USB cable
going<00:00:31.779> into<00:00:31.930> the<00:00:32.020> computer<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:33.430> USB<00:00:33.850> cable

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
going into the computer the USB cable

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.480 
going into the computer the USB cable
goes<00:00:34.450> to<00:00:34.660> this<00:00:34.809> little<00:00:35.110> circuit<00:00:36.010> board<00:00:36.190> here

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:36.490 
goes to this little circuit board here

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.960 
goes to this little circuit board here
which<00:00:37.150> has<00:00:37.300> got<00:00:37.360> a<00:00:37.840> four-way<00:00:38.730> left<00:00:39.730> right<00:00:39.940> up

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
which has got a four-way left right up

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.910 
which has got a four-way left right up
and<00:00:40.120> down<00:00:40.240> and<00:00:40.900> also<00:00:41.170> a<00:00:41.200> couple<00:00:41.500> buttons<00:00:41.650> there

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
and down and also a couple buttons there

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.880 
and down and also a couple buttons there
so<00:00:42.880> she's<00:00:43.150> got<00:00:43.360> alligator<00:00:43.900> clips<00:00:44.230> going<00:00:44.620> from

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
so she's got alligator clips going from

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.440 
so she's got alligator clips going from
those<00:00:45.070> particular<00:00:47.040> spots<00:00:48.040> on<00:00:48.250> that<00:00:48.430> board<00:00:48.820> -

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
those particular spots on that board -

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.200 
those particular spots on that board -
believe<00:00:49.990> it<00:00:50.079> or<00:00:50.110> not<00:00:50.230> a<00:00:50.290> piece<00:00:50.560> of<00:00:50.710> paper<00:00:51.210> that

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
believe it or not a piece of paper that

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.770 
believe it or not a piece of paper that
has<00:00:52.480> been<00:00:52.890> drawn<00:00:53.890> on<00:00:54.100> with<00:00:54.160> pencil<00:00:54.910> and<00:00:55.210> the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
has been drawn on with pencil and the

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.270 
has been drawn on with pencil and the
graphite<00:00:56.170> does<00:00:56.380> collect<00:00:56.680> conduct

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
graphite does collect conduct

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.600 
graphite does collect conduct
electricity<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:59.140> she's<00:00:59.829> holding<00:01:00.070> the<00:01:00.400> green

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
electricity and she's holding the green

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.799 
electricity and she's holding the green
in<00:01:00.970> her<00:01:01.210> hand<00:01:01.420> here<00:01:01.810> so<00:01:03.390> can<00:01:04.390> you<00:01:04.479> tell<00:01:04.629> us<00:01:04.689> a

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
in her hand here so can you tell us a

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.110 
in her hand here so can you tell us a
little<00:01:04.930> bit<00:01:05.079> about<00:01:05.170> how<00:01:05.470> you<00:01:05.530> designed<00:01:05.979> this

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.770 

and<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:11.260> had<00:01:12.130> a<00:01:12.159> fill<00:01:12.550> in<00:01:12.670> everything<00:01:13.060> like

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
and I had a fill in everything like

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.899 
and I had a fill in everything like
almost<00:01:14.170> tore<00:01:14.890> it's<00:01:15.159> a<00:01:15.250> salad<00:01:16.210> otherwise<00:01:16.990> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
almost tore it's a salad otherwise the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:26.899 
almost tore it's a salad otherwise the
cords<00:01:18.909> are<00:01:19.150> the<00:01:20.190> wires<00:01:21.190> when<00:01:21.610> I<00:01:21.700> pick<00:01:21.909> up<00:01:25.740> and

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
cords are the wires when I pick up and

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.700 
cords are the wires when I pick up and
this<00:01:27.909> I<00:01:28.120> could<00:01:28.360> not<00:01:28.390> do<00:01:28.750> it<00:01:28.840> was<00:01:29.080> way<00:01:29.320> too<00:01:29.350> long

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
this I could not do it was way too long

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.700 
this I could not do it was way too long
so<00:01:30.610> I<00:01:30.970> had<00:01:31.180> to<00:01:31.390> get<00:01:32.320> it<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:34.409> then<00:01:35.409> I<00:01:35.440> just

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
so I had to get it and then I just

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.590 
so I had to get it and then I just
hooked<00:01:35.890> up<00:01:36.010> the<00:01:36.250> cables<00:01:36.970> with<00:01:37.180> a<00:01:37.210> little<00:01:37.390> help

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
hooked up the cables with a little help

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:50.460 
hooked up the cables with a little help
from<00:01:37.659> the<00:01:38.049> makey<00:01:38.260> makey<00:01:38.350> sight<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:50.020> so<00:01:50.229> do<00:01:50.380> you

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.289 
from the makey makey sight and so do you
know<00:01:50.590> what<00:01:50.830> key<00:01:51.130> what<00:01:51.700> piano<00:01:51.970> key<00:01:52.180> is

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
know what key what piano key is

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.080 
know what key what piano key is
controlling<00:01:52.840> what<00:01:52.869> based<00:01:53.409> on<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.850> know<00:01:54.909> if<00:01:55.000> I
