00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:12.690
 On September 4, 2009 I was imprisoned 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.170
 sneakers and the rest society is 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.170
 history 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.900
 I never thought I was going to run a marathon 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.220
 and less that day that begins to run 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.220
 you know it would not succeed 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.610
 The deep challenge of the marathon is to make 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.290
 compatible all that training with 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.740
 a professional life and with a life 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.740
 personal 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.680
 In the end, all this has helped me a little 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.680
 movement of women running 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.630
 I have managed to mobilize many people and 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.630
 that these people feel like my band 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.200
 to run is to make possible what I believed 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.000
 it is impossible 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.000
 it's a dream to be able to run in london 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.730
 at 35 thousand reais each with one 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.140
 different story 42 kilometers to 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.140
 give everything for a cause 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.180
 indescribable 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.280
 go 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.090
 Y 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.650
 going back to london strong for me was very 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.800
 important I left london ago 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.560
 almost 11 years because I knew there was something 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.830
 that did not work well I was not 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.900
 well physically he had had a few 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.849
 small problems 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.980
 and when returning to Spain the six months to 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.420
 my mind are on an ovarian cancer and 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.420
 back to men 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.769
 feeling good mistress of my body 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.350
 super strong with energy was super 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.070
 important 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.070
 s 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.450
 for you 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:13.820
 a decadent is my away 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.500
 because I went wrong because I left because 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:27.120
 I knew there was something that did not work 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.870
 get over it and 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:34.110
 and I run again full of life I've seen 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.000
 so many times crossing that goal have I seen 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.209
 so many times I have seen my arms 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.150
 so many times crying that really not 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:47.299
 I know how I'll feel on Sunday 13 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.299
 April and I'm going to enjoy 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:57.930
 I'm not nervous, the road is already 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.930
 done and I really want to run 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:06.290
 the marathon is part suffering part 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.450
 joy part fun at the end run 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:12.020
 a marathon is like life I feel 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.750
 super dear and I will run with that impulse 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:18.760
 and with that energy of all those women 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.760
 that they told me to run for them 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.910

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.450

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.340

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.860
 and enjoy it does not matter if it is not 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.750
 marathon me what I want to convey with 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.150
 what I do is that you have to give yourself the 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.669
 opportunity and to show you that 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.330
 you are able to do many more things 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.330
 what do you think 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:11.710
 after the scare 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:17.070

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.070
