00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
breakout functionality to strike attacks

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.210 
breakout functionality to strike attacks
to<00:02:36.790> reversal<00:02:37.660> animations<00:02:38.290> so<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.739> as<00:02:39.070> soon

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
to reversal animations so that as soon

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.890 
to reversal animations so that as soon
as<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:39.459> counter<00:02:39.820> an<00:02:39.880> attack<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.720> know<00:02:40.810> you

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
as you counter an attack you know you

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.940 
as you counter an attack you know you
can<00:02:41.019> automatically<00:02:41.470> move<00:02:41.680> your<00:02:41.830> character

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
can automatically move your character

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.800 
can automatically move your character
and<00:02:42.280> just<00:02:42.340> go<00:02:42.550> in<00:02:42.700> and<00:02:43.000> try<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:43.390> follow<00:02:43.660> with

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
and just go in and try to follow with

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.750 
and just go in and try to follow with
another<00:02:44.050> attack<00:02:44.350> whereas<00:02:45.070> in<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.280> past<00:02:45.489> you

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
another attack whereas in the past you

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.000 
another attack whereas in the past you
had<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.060> wait<00:02:46.239> for<00:02:46.870> your<00:02:47.050> character<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.470> return

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
had to wait for your character to return

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.560 
had to wait for your character to return
back<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.400> their<00:02:48.519> idle<00:02:48.880> before<00:02:49.150> you<00:02:49.239> could<00:02:49.390> move

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
back to their idle before you could move

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.840 
back to their idle before you could move
them<00:02:49.750> so<00:02:50.470> just<00:02:50.920> that<00:02:51.130> small<00:02:51.340> change<00:02:51.640> has

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
them so just that small change has

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.400 
them so just that small change has
really<00:02:52.209> increased<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.810> speed<00:02:53.019> of<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.230> game

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
really increased the speed of the game

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.229 
really increased the speed of the game
made<00:02:53.709> the<00:02:53.980> action<00:02:54.370> flow<00:02:54.550> that<00:02:54.730> much<00:02:54.910> smoother

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
made the action flow that much smoother

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.880 
made the action flow that much smoother
alright<00:02:55.870> looks<00:02:56.050> like<00:02:56.170> we've<00:02:56.290> got<00:02:56.470> our<00:02:56.620> first

gotta break his shin right there now
that<00:03:02.140> action<00:03:02.470> right<00:03:02.530> there<00:03:02.830> is<00:03:02.950> actually

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
that action right there is actually

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.800 
that action right there is actually
something<00:03:03.400> that<00:03:03.549> it's<00:03:04.060> end<00:03:04.239> of<00:03:04.360> itself<00:03:04.570> is<00:03:04.690> not

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
competitors are are stuck in this cage

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.460 
competitors are are stuck in this cage
together<00:04:31.240> and<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:31.960> only<00:04:32.110> way<00:04:32.229> to<00:04:32.290> actually

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
together and the only way to actually

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.469 
together and the only way to actually
get<00:04:32.770> out<00:04:32.919> is<00:04:33.100> to<00:04:33.130> use<00:04:33.370> one<00:04:33.580> of<00:04:33.610> those<00:04:33.789> panel

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
get out is to use one of those panel

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.050 
get out is to use one of those panel
braking<00:04:34.870> moves<00:04:35.289> so<00:04:36.160> it<00:04:36.190> looks<00:04:36.400> like<00:04:36.580> CM<00:04:37.030> Punk

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
braking moves so it looks like CM Punk

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.000 
braking moves so it looks like CM Punk
thinks<00:04:37.660> he<00:04:37.870> stands<00:04:38.200> a<00:04:38.289> chance<00:04:38.320> by<00:04:38.740> going<00:04:38.950> to

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
thinks he stands a chance by going to

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.950 
thinks he stands a chance by going to
the<00:04:39.100> top<00:04:39.250> and<00:04:39.460> so<00:04:39.610> I<00:04:39.789> don't<00:04:40.030> know<00:04:40.180> what<00:04:40.510> you're
