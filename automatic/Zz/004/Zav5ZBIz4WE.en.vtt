00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
version so i just made my own version

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.960 
version so i just made my own version
and<00:01:27.990> all<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.500> one<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.040> those<00:01:29.100> blank<00:01:29.490> CD

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
and all it is is one of those blank CD

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.130 
and all it is is one of those blank CD
things<00:01:30.590> that<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.710> hold<00:01:31.920> them<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:33.270> cap<00:01:33.509> and

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
things that you hold them in the cap and

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.480 
things that you hold them in the cap and
then<00:01:34.470> i<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:35.070> got<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.670> cut<00:01:36.030> out<00:01:36.540> cardboard

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
then i just got it cut out cardboard

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.319 
then i just got it cut out cardboard
about<00:01:38.689> like<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:40.020> big<00:01:40.430> from<00:01:41.430> my<00:01:41.579> old<00:01:41.759> shoebox

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
about like that big from my old shoebox

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.800 
about like that big from my old shoebox
and<00:01:43.220> then<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.490> just<00:01:44.729> electrical<00:01:45.329> tape<00:01:45.570> it

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
and then I just electrical tape it

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.840 
and then I just electrical tape it
around<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:48.320> magazine<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:50.009> now<00:01:50.040> it's<00:01:50.490> like

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
around the magazine and so now it's like

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.850 
around the magazine and so now it's like
there<00:01:51.450> but<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:53.220> only<00:01:53.369> bad<00:01:53.640> thing<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:54.680> used<00:01:55.680> a

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
there but the only bad thing is used a

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.670 
there but the only bad thing is used a
lot<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.540> electrical<00:01:57.540> tape<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.079> electrical

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
lot of electrical tape and electrical

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.240 
lot of electrical tape and electrical
tape<00:01:58.890> isn't<00:01:59.180> really<00:02:00.180> expensive<00:02:00.540> but<00:02:00.930> it's

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
tape isn't really expensive but it's

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.209 
tape isn't really expensive but it's
more<00:02:02.250> than<00:02:02.310> duct<00:02:02.790> tape<00:02:03.259> but<00:02:04.259> it's<00:02:04.530> worth<00:02:05.009> it

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
more than duct tape but it's worth it

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.620 
more than duct tape but it's worth it
because<00:02:05.399> now<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.700> don't<00:02:05.850> have<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.210> buy<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.390> bunch

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
because now I don't have to buy a bunch

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.490 
because now I don't have to buy a bunch
of<00:02:06.780> new<00:02:06.930> shells<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:08.720> so<00:02:09.720> if<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.020> have<00:02:10.289> one<00:02:10.470> of

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
of new shells and so if you have one of

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.990 
of new shells and so if you have one of
these<00:02:10.619> guns<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.310> you're<00:02:11.400> trying<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.670> loosen

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
these guns and you're trying to loosen

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.360 
these guns and you're trying to loosen
your<00:02:12.390> thing

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
your thing

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.210 
your thing
your<00:02:13.760> little<00:02:14.060> shells<00:02:14.870> get<00:02:15.260> one<00:02:15.440> of<00:02:15.560> these<00:02:15.709> but

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
your little shells get one of these but

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.640 
your little shells get one of these but
or<00:02:17.120> make<00:02:17.540> one<00:02:17.750> of<00:02:17.840> these<00:02:17.959> but<00:02:18.230> when<00:02:18.349> you<00:02:18.440> make

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
or make one of these but when you make

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.190 
or make one of these but when you make
it<00:02:18.860> make<00:02:19.610> sure<00:02:19.640> that<00:02:20.120> you<00:02:20.239> have<00:02:20.420> make<00:02:20.870> it<00:02:21.049> with

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
it make sure that you have make it with

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.580 
it make sure that you have make it with
the<00:02:21.379> magazine<00:02:21.860> in<00:02:22.720> because<00:02:23.720> when<00:02:23.930> I<00:02:23.959> first

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
the magazine in because when I first

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.160 
the magazine in because when I first
tried<00:02:24.860> it<00:02:25.010> right<00:02:25.879> here<00:02:26.299> and<00:02:26.510> it<00:02:26.659> wouldn't<00:02:26.959> fit

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
tried it right here and it wouldn't fit

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.050 
tried it right here and it wouldn't fit
because<00:02:27.560> I<00:02:27.620> did<00:02:27.920> it<00:02:28.010> when<00:02:28.099> I<00:02:28.159> was<00:02:28.250> out<00:02:28.519> so<00:02:28.849> make

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
because I did it when I was out so make

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.020 
because I did it when I was out so make
sure<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.390> try<00:02:29.690> it<00:02:29.890> when<00:02:30.890> it's<00:02:31.129> up<00:02:31.400> here<00:02:31.730> so

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
sure you try it when it's up here so

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.000 
sure you try it when it's up here so
then<00:02:32.209> you<00:02:32.360> can<00:02:32.510> still<00:02:32.959> take<00:02:33.349> it<00:02:33.500> out<00:02:33.680> and

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
then you can still take it out and

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:41.559 
then you can still take it out and
everything<00:02:34.489> and<00:02:35.769> um<00:02:38.170> so<00:02:39.170> yeah<00:02:39.739> um<00:02:40.360> here's<00:02:41.360> a

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
everything and um so yeah um here's a

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.250 
everything and um so yeah um here's a
look<00:02:41.720> again<00:02:41.959> and<00:02:42.670> it<00:02:43.670> it<00:02:44.060> looks<00:02:44.450> kind<00:02:44.720> of<00:02:44.810> junky

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
look again and it it looks kind of junky

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.800 
look again and it it looks kind of junky
but<00:02:45.470> it<00:02:45.739> works<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:46.340> I<00:02:47.000> think<00:02:47.060> I<00:02:47.329> might<00:02:47.540> spray

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
but it works and I think I might spray

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.410 
but it works and I think I might spray
paint<00:02:48.079> this<00:02:48.230> gun<00:02:48.500> black<00:02:48.859> and<00:02:49.220> then<00:02:50.090> spray

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
paint this gun black and then spray

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.970 
paint this gun black and then spray
paint<00:02:50.660> this<00:02:50.900> silver<00:02:51.790> but<00:02:52.790> I<00:02:53.000> don't<00:02:53.299> know<00:02:53.980> so

it or something instead of this
electrical<00:03:00.829> tape<00:03:01.069> because<00:03:01.220> electrical<00:03:01.940> gate

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
electrical tape because electrical gate

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.680 
electrical tape because electrical gate
is<00:03:02.390> kind<00:03:02.659> of<00:03:02.750> flimsy<00:03:03.530> so<00:03:04.250> yeah<00:03:04.819> hot<00:03:05.090> glue<00:03:05.329> it<00:03:05.510> or
