 hello to you all Slavik and today we 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.630
 look at the new motherboard from 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.480
 asus companies 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.940
 as you remember recently i did a review on 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.289
 msi motherboard 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.109
 m bauer but as in that review said that 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.779
 she did not meet my expectations therefore 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.490
 she went back to the maker and fame 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.849
 to god 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:33.360
 I don't want this myself because she doesn't 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.960
 finished raw and I decided to take something 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.559
 more interesting is asus maximus 5 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.430
 formula from the series of republic of gamers 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:50.010
 $ 310 seemingly interesting 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:53.010
 product let's see what is in 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.480
 In general, in this box there is a lot like 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.879
 always different marketing 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.770
 it's all I have for a long time it did not 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.890
 I believe so we will see what is 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.890
 inside 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:18.960
 slowly getting there is tea coming 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:22.740
 such a kit is such a thing 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.570
 cling usually in hotels on the doors to 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:33.680
 do not disturb a little on the back panel 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:38.280
 Disc instructions for instructions too 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.890
 just nice of them there are places like this 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.270
 here is the module and 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:48.509
 pis when bluetooth is as usual 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.380
 cables for connecting hard drives 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:57.750
 several sata to connect 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:00.810
 multiple video card connector is also this 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.220
 what is it honestly do not know what is 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:11.929
 languages like her sleep labeled 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.929
 republic of games do not know this 2 antenka 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.380
 daisies service cables in general 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:27.239
 quite an interesting set 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.810
 but I honestly said in the past 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:33.440
 review 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.440
 absolutely not nasa hands looking at her 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:51.830
 that's how it looks now opens 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:00.470
 we will look what to say to him 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.690
 she has some dude style 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.160
 some like this all red 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.540
 and black are so different colors 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.940
 but I don't like it very much 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.910
 immediately draws attention to this one 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.860
 here's a cooling system that can 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.750
 to put 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.970
 dropsy ie there are plugs for 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:25.350
 water cooling is very interesting 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:30.750
 the thing is we are certainly protesting as well in 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:32.540
 Basically, the usual z 77 socket is nothing 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.730
 here is new 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:40.200
 what so want to pay attention well 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:44.070
 but what to look for here 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:47.430
 this auto overclocking button is 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.800
 very cool yes for a card for over 310 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.500
 there are no dollars here for 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.450
 automatic overclocking this 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.780
 of course immediately enchant so 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.750
 In principle, we will usually test everything 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.200
 I'll tell you later how she is 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.200
 will be
