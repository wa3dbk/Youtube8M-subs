just<00:04:42.240> like<00:04:42.660> this<00:04:43.200> and<00:04:43.560> then<00:04:43.950> after<00:04:44.130> that<00:04:44.370> you

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
just like this and then after that you

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.190 
just like this and then after that you
can<00:04:44.520> put<00:04:44.850> it<00:04:44.940> in<00:04:45.030> a<00:04:45.120> mason<00:04:45.300> jar<00:04:45.780> and<00:04:45.930> if<00:04:46.080> you

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
can put it in a mason jar and if you

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.409 
can put it in a mason jar and if you
want<00:04:46.440> the<00:04:46.860> consistency<00:04:47.790> to<00:04:47.820> be<00:04:48.030> a<00:04:48.180> little

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
want the consistency to be a little

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.690 
want the consistency to be a little
thicker<00:04:48.750> like<00:04:49.080> actual<00:04:49.500> caramel<00:04:49.979> you<00:04:50.160> can<00:04:50.550> put

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
thicker like actual caramel you can put

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.640 
thicker like actual caramel you can put
it<00:04:50.820> in<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.150> refrigerator<00:04:51.720> for<00:04:51.810> a<00:04:52.110> few<00:04:52.169> minutes

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
it in the refrigerator for a few minutes

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.710 
it in the refrigerator for a few minutes
but<00:04:53.580> we're<00:04:53.760> actually<00:04:53.940> going<00:04:54.210> to<00:04:54.270> go<00:04:54.360> straight

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
but we're actually going to go straight

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.570 
but we're actually going to go straight
into<00:04:54.930> decorating<00:04:55.410> and<00:04:55.710> it's<00:04:55.860> easier<00:04:56.310> when

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
into decorating and it's easier when

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.030 
into decorating and it's easier when
it's<00:04:56.760> more<00:04:57.000> liquidy<00:04:57.960> and<00:04:57.990> watery<00:04:58.560> like<00:04:58.830> this

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
it's more liquidy and watery like this

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.940 
it's more liquidy and watery like this
