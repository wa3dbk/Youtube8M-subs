00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.970
 themes to 9 on the new map karkhov 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:38.150
 I think it's good that's good 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.980
 that because I'm too strong co I managed 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.820
 to remember the name of the map which 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:46.519
 is exceptional so I do not have a 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.910
 part where I'm in platoon with pub st 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:52.670

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.610
 9 Once a new map where you have 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:01.129
 someone still interesting about a 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:06.979
 strategic point of view but it takes 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:08.270
 to pay enough attention to the 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.799
 long streets because there is so much 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.840
 hives that are all straight in 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.909
 perfect straight line 1 of the blow you 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.100
 can be aligned from far away 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.720
 you have not even idea that link to a halo 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.450
 end of the street is the charm you and 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.869
 line and thanks to the help of his little ones 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.940
 friends 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:30.170
 and you will you get smashed on the 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.990
 nail of what distances you have 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.810
 of view 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.180
 uncovered that are pretty huge and of 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.590
 blow you may take shots from 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.659
 people you do not see so 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.220
 Be very careful and really knew 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.590
 use the cutlery to move from 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.810
 covered in cover and follow the walls 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.320
 especially not lug around at the best of 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.799
 street otherwise you're going to get screwed 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.080
 that then objective try to take them 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.780
 by the side they are well saw that they 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.670
 had massively on this side the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.350
 map 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.890
 so I advance one already a first and 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.539
 yes to whom I make a big hole in 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.140
 the flank he was kind enough to me 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.090
 show her flank laurent who's coming 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.180
 July hair eliès ds who was 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.730
 already completed dear I advance 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.799
 we do not see them they are in the street late 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:28.799
 what is in the next review 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:31.980
 importance nmap also to look at the 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:34.260
 just look at the map the little 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.930
 minimal mattress to see where are the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.820
 enemies why you deceive of refusal 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.880
 what it is and quickly made of you 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.859
 deceive druid do not understand that a 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.200
 enemy of one that the enemy in such street 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:47.220
 rufin lace no drop which has 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.650
 called for help 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.239
 I came to him and the one goal 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.850
 it's really about taking them by 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.810
 behind to get around them 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:00.950
 juice but a first dose or cellars and 1 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:06.080
 it seems to me only to my three 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:08.550
 even better to assume the fire 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.980
 jumps a dose is normally there 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.320
 should spend there 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:17.640
 this is the next time they had 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:22.590
 three brought a bird fire extinguisher 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:27.180
 water we approach we approach 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.980
 approach and we just get hairy pile 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.930
 to pick them they have not seen us 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.760
 to get behind the kavé of us not 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.060
 had at all that's it they are in the process of 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.060
 react 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:45.180
 2 had to eliminate and we breathe 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:49.160
 there is one left and 1 vk always i 'm going 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:52.350
 try medicine 12 km2 I have poorly targeted 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:59.880
 just hold on the edge of the shot my shot 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:04:02.400
 ricocheted kkb 2 all currencies and 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.910
 except that bk is bothering me 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.080
 blow I just damaged caterpillars 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.080
 kavé two lighthouses 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.780
 I move forward then to have I am 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.480
 advanced to really have a good 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.510
 a good shooting solution and I put my 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.910
 dose and no drop the finish 1 cellar 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.230
 is one who deep down bad Basque 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.270
 does he shoot himself in the 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.070
 nape by just standing in front of my 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.830
 artillery cannons that's right next 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.419
 a little gray I try to see this not 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.870
 already on the grill at the rank that is the fact 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:41.930
 jump dog I look while advancing 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.600
 kavé makes his proteges behind 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.810
 carcasses 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.030
 so it's really imperative to 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.510
 to be able to approach to be able to him 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.850
 to hurt laurent who just jumped I 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.010
 shelters me well on the side of carcasses for 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:03.470
 that he can not shoot me or 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:05.960
 as little as possible and I try to advanced 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:10.370
 do not you from the power of the horses of the 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:16.390
 theme 9 to lend him a joke and 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:16.390
 as if not to bother him 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:22.510
 Here it remains nothing more than a face 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:27.950
 the s eu 152 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:30.560
 it is a great time away and a 4.45 xl 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:33.650
 black queen if they go so where are we going 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.240
 let it go we will go to ask 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.630
 in the cap until it's 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.630
 completed 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.880
 a very nice map that changes a 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.980
 little 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.320
 with big streets and really needs 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.700
 pay attention to these great streets this 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.990
 who can very well be someone who 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.880
 is stashed at the other end of the street and 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.350
 who are shooting at you that you do not see 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.880
 because it's way too far to 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.510
 to be listed but thanks to the spots of his 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.060
 comrades 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:02.080
 since it's straight lines inserted 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:06.790
 there he'll have known very easy for 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.960
 him to turn on that is important 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.340
 also to look at the mini map for 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.020
 know where you are because sometimes 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.200
 you have the impression that an enemy 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.610
 I found I had the impression there 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.650
 an impression of believing that the enemy 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:20.670
 is right next door and actually no it's 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:23.260
 in one in the next street is 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:25.090
 always important precisely so much 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.910
 more on this map I find to have a 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.410
 look on the minimal but a map really 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.340
 friendly then a little bit 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:37.000
 extraordinary a small a small class 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:38.470
 3722 damage it seems a name 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.600
 a part I wanted to show you just 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:42.100
 for the new map 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.960
 you show a little what we can do 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.730
 but not hesitate to get around on this 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.790
 new map 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:50.200
 it really lends itself to that try to 

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.610
 create blocking points and try 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.190
 to get around by the streets 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.630
 adjacent 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.860
 I think there are a lot of things 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.740
 to do that from this point of view 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.000
 so on this bath just tell you that 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.470
 you can always subscribe was 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.330
 not already done and thank you to everyone 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:06.330
 subscribe go on this chao
