00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 we send directly from the sigma stand and around 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.730
 the following minutes will bring you 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.519
 we had to climb up in here 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.259
 internal or internal backstage 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.540
 area where you can see all the things 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.130
 We were not allowed on the trade fair 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.590
 take to the regular exhibition area 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.670
 but had to film here completely 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.230
 interesting I thought we were doing 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.430
 if we already have the possibility 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.490
 have to come in there then 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.930
 We also film and that's why we want 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.420
 Just show what you see now 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.980
 this year to photokina 2012 has new 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.110
 I'll just start 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.570
 yes, here I have it for example 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.430
 new 17 70 with image stabilizer 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.710
 That's the classic lens kit 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.649
 replacement lens so if you look at one 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.870
 camera buys and 18 550 then it is 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.420
 that definitely the better variant of it 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.280
 that is, and the b 28 has a 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.270
 variable aperture over the focal length so 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.180
 until aperture 4 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.219
 but through image stabilizer and through 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.440
 The optical quality is the real thing 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.629
 insanely better than the kit 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.649
 objective but that is for ours 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.960
 area not so interesting now 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.330
 which is much more interesting what we here 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.979
 can show is that is currently attached 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.140
 the sd1 furniture and I'll try 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.659
 just with one hand off 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:18.150
 is this objective I have here 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:20.520
 a 35 millimeter 1 to 1.4 lens that 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.840
 An open aperture is called a maximum 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.670
 open aperture from 1 21 to 14 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.130
 incredible high-speed lens and 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.750
 In my opinion, the 35 mm 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.300
 focal length ideal 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.790
 between the fifties and the 24th 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.040
 Example exist 50 is on 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.800
 weddings or on reportages often 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.330
 even in emergency situations a bit too long 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.220
 you take pictures and you already have 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.510
 again a slight zoom in me 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.150
 or this is normal focal length 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.800
 up is a bit of focused 24 mm 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.660
 with me often I am very far in the 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.190
 company camera and there were missing many times 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.590
 So this intermediate piece is not stronger 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:00.729
 between piece and that is just the 35th 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.530
 mm 1 4l probably faster focus so 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.090
 I'm really curious what it can and 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.740
 I'm curious about the raw data 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.560
 the optical quality at the Volksbank 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.410
 then after a camera will be one 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.260
 Another innovation is the 120 to 300 mm 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.900
 at 28 this is of course a real one 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.790
 Debris but here you can see that too 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.440
 sigma tries in the high end area 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.420
 clearly increase 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.720
 the finish is top one has here 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.980
 continuous the aperture of 1 to 2 8 has 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.620
 also a built-in image stabilizer 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.050
 and some other companies are shy 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.950
 yes still in this swamp super tele 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.360
 jensen 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.170
 to install these screens motors 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.390
 but is extremely interesting for ours 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.299
 area people portrait photography i 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.940
 know several photographers specifically 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.110
 blind 28 300 mm want to work and at 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.459
 the objective one has then one more 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.140
 play a bit and if both with them 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.670
 but I'm already impressive what 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.940
 find impressive what you see 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.709
 here from the stack just leaves so too 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.730
 if you do not have mine every day now 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.890
 camera would hang 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.490
 the lens definitely not but it is 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.980
 just times 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.180
 his house bank another thing the 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.120
 i can imagine is this 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.710
 incredible ingenious pancake lens 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.720
 it has a usb connection and you can 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.360
 The objective images can be viewed directly 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.190
 store in the laptop purely without a camera 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.750
 So you do not need a camera anymore because 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.440
 it is nonsense 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.760
 we have fun here because of me 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.140
 In any case , I think we have to 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.940
 definitely have some news here 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.460
 the really interesting and indeed 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.980
 supplies sigma as the first manufacturer of 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:34.850
 lenses a calibrated tool 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.380
 for the photographer 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.910
 I have the lid here then I can 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.370
 I also do the bayonet there 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.300
 I would just do that objectively 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.800
 sit on 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.400
 I have to do it all now 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.290
 with one hand open it up 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.150
 Of course you need it if I am so 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.470
 folded 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.750
 I do not want to continue now because 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.150
 you need it you put it on it closes 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.629
 with usb to the computer and then can 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.390
 here for example the focus 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:05.360
 speed d focus so new focus 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.970
 tuning yourself on the lens and is 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.079
 so no longer on any 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.939
 corrections or whatever year 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.439
 instructed rhythms checks and 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:13.579
 but can do much more namely the 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:14.510
 Objectively to his own needs 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.190
 to adjust 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.109
 For example, some people do not like it 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.049
 fast focus slowly makes my focus 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.330
 or maybe like different focus focus 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.380
 possibilities in the way I would 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.240
 say that's right 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.120
 interesting let alone of these 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.270
 six 40 megapixel monsters the sd 1 mill 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.210
 but apart so 35 14 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.060
 I'm pretty fascinated anyway 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.160
 from the 85 14 by sigma a great one 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.510
 fixed focal length with that I will now 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.940
 Do not even have to look what's up 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.230
 comes out at the moment 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.000
 Maybe I can beat this one here 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.440
 I would take it home but me 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.440
 I'm really curious if my camera
