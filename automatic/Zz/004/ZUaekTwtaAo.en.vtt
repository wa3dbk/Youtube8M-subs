about 10 it has a 2.2 megapixel camera

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.580 
about 10 it has a 2.2 megapixel camera

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
on the back and this is probably the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.789 
on the back and this is probably the
biggest<00:01:03.629> thing<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:03.989> they<00:01:04.260> change<00:01:04.530> with<00:01:04.619> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
biggest thing that they change with the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.740 
biggest thing that they change with the
Samsung<00:01:05.010> Galaxy<00:01:05.519> s5<00:01:05.760> with<00:01:06.299> all<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.600> new

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
Samsung Galaxy s5 with all the new

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.270 
Samsung Galaxy s5 with all the new
features<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.260> they<00:01:07.409> throw<00:01:07.740> into<00:01:08.130> it

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
features that they throw into it

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.929 
features that they throw into it
including<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:09.229> 0.3<00:01:10.400> autofocus<00:01:11.400> time<00:01:11.670> which<00:01:11.909> is

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
including a 0.3 autofocus time which is

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.320 
including a 0.3 autofocus time which is
i<00:01:12.270> believe<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:13.080> fastest<00:01:13.650> smartphone

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
i believe the fastest smartphone

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.850 
i believe the fastest smartphone
autofocus<00:01:15.330> there<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.320> we'll<00:01:16.470> just<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.740> to

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
autofocus there is so we'll just have to

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.080 
autofocus there is so we'll just have to
see<00:01:16.890> about<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.369> when<00:01:17.580> we<00:01:17.640> actually<00:01:17.850> get<00:01:18.030> a

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090

all the main features as I possibly

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.920 
all the main features as I possibly
could<00:04:07.100> the<00:04:07.580> specs<00:04:07.970> a<00:04:08.239> couple<00:04:08.630> different

could the specs a couple different

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.170 
could the specs a couple different

like<00:04:13.519> I<00:04:13.640> said<00:04:13.820> before<00:04:13.910> you<00:04:14.209> can<00:04:14.239> check<00:04:14.510> that

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
like I said before you can check that

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.199 
like I said before you can check that
out<00:04:14.690> in<00:04:14.870> the<00:04:14.930> scripture<00:04:15.260> down<00:04:15.410> below<00:04:15.709> and<00:04:15.980> I

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
out in the scripture down below and I

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.330 
out in the scripture down below and I
guess<00:04:17.209> that's<00:04:17.390> it<00:04:17.630> I<00:04:17.840> try<00:04:18.440> to<00:04:18.500> fit<00:04:18.739> it<00:04:18.830> as<00:04:18.979> short

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
guess that's it I try to fit it as short

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.860 
guess that's it I try to fit it as short
as<00:04:19.549> I<00:04:19.640> possibly<00:04:19.820> could<00:04:20.180> so<00:04:20.239> you<00:04:20.479> don't<00:04:20.630> have<00:04:20.720> to

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
as I possibly could so you don't have to

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.420 
as I possibly could so you don't have to
