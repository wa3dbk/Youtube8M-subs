whatever it's very important that you

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.089 
whatever it's very important that you
follow<00:00:30.150> your<00:00:30.420> gauge<00:00:30.630> because<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.439> also<00:00:31.710> will

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
follow your gauge because this also will

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.560 
follow your gauge because this also will
determine<00:00:32.460> how<00:00:32.730> your<00:00:32.910> piece<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.300> going<00:00:33.480> to

come<00:00:33.780> out<00:00:33.930> now<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.140> know<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.440> doesn't<00:00:34.590> always

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
come out now I know it doesn't always

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.799 
come out now I know it doesn't always
matter<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.430> much<00:00:35.489> when<00:00:36.270> you're<00:00:36.420> working<00:00:36.780> with

couple rows of garter stitch and then

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.200 
couple rows of garter stitch and then
put<00:01:04.530> three<00:01:04.799> stitches<00:01:05.040> each<00:01:05.430> side<00:01:05.760> garter

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
stitch and it kind of makes it lay a

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.590 
stitch and it kind of makes it lay a
little<00:01:07.680> flatter<00:01:07.939> so<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.090> way<00:01:09.240> you're<00:01:09.420> going

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
little flatter so that way you're going

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.510 
little flatter so that way you're going
to<00:01:09.630> make<00:01:09.689> sure<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.290> you've<00:01:10.470> got<00:01:10.710> more<00:01:11.220> than

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
to make sure that you've got more than

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.330 
to make sure that you've got more than
your<00:01:11.700> 17<00:01:12.390> stitches<00:01:12.720> going<00:01:13.200> across<00:01:13.560> here<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.040> we

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
your 17 stitches going across here so we

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.380 
your 17 stitches going across here so we
can<00:01:14.520> measure<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.560> knit<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.770> piece<00:01:17.390> with

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
can measure that and knit the piece with

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.770 
can measure that and knit the piece with
the<00:01:18.540> required<00:01:19.020> needles<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:20.090> just<00:01:21.090> do<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.479> as

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
the required needles and just do it as

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.510 
the required needles and just do it as
you<00:01:22.200> normally<00:01:22.409> would<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:22.920> then<00:01:23.189> you're<00:01:23.400> going

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
you normally would and then you're going

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.399 
you normally would and then you're going
to<00:01:23.580> lay<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.850> out<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.450> then<00:01:24.509> we're<00:01:25.140> going<00:01:25.320> to

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
to lay it out and then we're going to

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.520 
to lay it out and then we're going to
use<00:01:25.770> our<00:01:26.009> knit<00:01:26.369> check<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.320> lay<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.439> across

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
use our knit check and lay it across

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.440 
use our knit check and lay it across
here<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.640> really<00:01:29.880> should<00:01:30.030> measure

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
here and you you really should measure

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.020 
here and you you really should measure
this<00:01:30.720> over<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.110> four<00:01:31.409> inch<00:01:31.530> period<00:01:32.009> or<00:01:32.340> space
