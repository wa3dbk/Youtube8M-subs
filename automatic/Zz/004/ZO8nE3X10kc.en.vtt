00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.960
 then guys welcome inside 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:12.550
 this both xing was a product that 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.550
 was missing from my channel 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.990
 unboxing of nokia lumia 15 20 before 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.300
 start I wanted to thank francesco 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.820
 graziani because he made this possible 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.259
 it is at the same time also to thank 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.439
 nokia's press office to have me 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.880
 sent the product so we go to 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.640
 unboxing let's go here to 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.550
 cut the seal is already cut will be 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.160
 a rehearsal phone is also good sport 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.680
 here it is then so huge really but 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.950
 it is therefore very light yellow 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.180
 just a garish color 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.790
 whereas I will have it tested for 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.890
 a few days I'll have to use it as a phone 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.600
 in short, therefore I will have to 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.660
 get used to this greatness in the 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.930
 package we find the tool for 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.949
 ejection of the sim 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.440
 we find then here we see a moment 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.140
 make left from a previous 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:10.630
 instruction manual and nothing else 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:15.240
 then headphones in ear with matching color 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:19.539
 of the phone with the various usb cable changes 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:23.200
 micro usb charger fights by 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:24.819
 wall with usb input so let's go e 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.890
 to raise this stuff let's see if the 

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:28.360
 phone was sent with some 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.630
 but I would charge one first 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.819
 clean well guys gave a clean 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.649
 now we can look at it more then 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:38.890
 take a quick look at this 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.179
 tablet anyway 6 inches and we have 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.280
 volume rocker on the right side 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:43.090
 button lighting button 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.920
 camera 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.849
 behind the large 20 megapixel sensor 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:52.300
 with dual LED flash on the left side 

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:56.440
 instead we find two slots one for the 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.090
 micro sd and the other for the nano sim 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.770
 in addition to this, in short, it will be discussed later 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.149
 better in the review after a few 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.140
 day of trial first or we are going to 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.929
 turn it on and let's take a look 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.590
 look at what it looks like 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:07.590
 let's see nokia 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.570
 windows phone already begins 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.310
 in short, we immediately notice the quality of the 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.160
 display that really good we find ourselves of 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.280
 in front of a 6 inch ips LCD unit 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.830
 with full hd resolution then at 1080p 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.780
 asks us to start started here 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.000
 we set the Italian to note how 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.500
 now he hasn't inserted a sim yet 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.540
 however to note as also the 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.180
 Pressing the keys reflects the color 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.640
 of the body of the phone in fact 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.730
 we find the combination of the yellow we do 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.770
 a recommended configuration we see 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.700
 this all this information ok 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:54.330
 go on 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:55.860
 now look for wifi network here I have just 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.020
 written the wifi password and with one 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.820
 similar keyboard really is impossible 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.490
 being able to make mistakes 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.840
 because it really is made big and well 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.030
 therefore consequently also in this or 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.280
 this orientation already works well 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.680
 let's continue , it's also difficult for me 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.390
 insert it inside the frame 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.160
 let's move on 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.720
 here he asks me to log in with 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.840
 the microsoft account we're going to do it 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.340
 immediately 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.600
 perfect you want to create a backup we put 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.230
 now it is not saturated otherwise 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:28.260
 completely the wifi line 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:33.900
 is now configuring the final things of the 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:35.340
 perfect phone has finished 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.370
 install all the apps so we can 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.050
 going on to almost finished is not that 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.800
 will help you configure the activation of 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.800
 phone let's move on 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.670
 okay this we can for the moment 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.890
 avoid perfect we are center but there 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.520
 we are catapulted immediately 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.370
 inside of 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.400
 if the various things do not open you room 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.110
 we are not now in the graphic 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.030
 general of windows phone 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.830
 here we have all the various applications 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.360
 so now I will close this video here 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.239
 I'm going to insert the sim and start using it 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.850
 a little bit and then I'll see a little bit 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.260
 what are the usage impressions for that 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.790
 which concerns your requests instead 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.410
 if you have any party requested 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.420
 particular as I am new to the world 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.830
 of windows phone and therefore also with 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.630
 lumia etcetera 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.980
 whatever you need if I am 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.210
 able to do something maybe 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.890
 integrate into the review 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.660
 itself or if it will deserve just one 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.910
 different in-depth analysis I will do just one 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.650
 focus on that thing 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.550
 there for the moment I have to say that it is 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.960
 in short, at the level of conception having a 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.570
 in short, tablet in hand is something a bit 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.370
 a little different because i was right in 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.290
 hand and use it with one hand 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.020
 in short it is not really easy 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.280
 but this then a oriented phone 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.560
 let's just see productivity 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.480
 immediately immediately here that stands out 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.220
 office therefore is accordingly a 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.510
 phone that should not be used 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.940
 simply as a telephone but also 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.400
 in short, like a companion even in the 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.870
 work so i just have to wait 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.840
 in fact this year synchronizing the 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.310
 contacts with my photos I have left 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.200
 who greet you and give you an appointment at 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.200
 next video a greeting to all hello
