have<00:01:01.890> them<00:01:02.270> the<00:01:03.270> concept<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.899> not<00:01:04.110> having<00:01:04.739> them

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
have them the concept of not having them

know humming along within a narrow range

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.120 
know humming along within a narrow range
obviously<00:02:00.540> when<00:02:01.079> it's<00:02:01.200> time<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.500> eat<00:02:01.740> and

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
obviously when it's time to eat and

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.310 
obviously when it's time to eat and
you're<00:02:02.189> feeling<00:02:02.520> hunger<00:02:03.049> the<00:02:04.049> blood<00:02:04.290> sugar

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
you're feeling hunger the blood sugar

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.249 
you're feeling hunger the blood sugar
has<00:02:05.159> dropped<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.610> little<00:02:05.820> bit<00:02:06.060> but<00:02:06.750> it's<00:02:07.020> not

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
has dropped a little bit but it's not

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.520 
has dropped a little bit but it's not
the<00:02:08.069> roller<00:02:08.910> coaster<00:02:09.509> ride<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.810> blood<00:02:10.410> sugar

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
the roller coaster ride of blood sugar

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.980 
the roller coaster ride of blood sugar
going<00:02:11.800> up<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:12.069> down<00:02:12.160> and<00:02:12.310> it<00:02:12.700> is<00:02:12.880> one<00:02:13.120> blood

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
going up and down and it is one blood

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.020 
going up and down and it is one blood
sugar<00:02:14.290> is<00:02:14.530> more<00:02:14.890> on<00:02:14.980> a<00:02:15.040> roller<00:02:15.310> coaster<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.910> it

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
sugar is more on a roller coaster and it

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.199 
sugar is more on a roller coaster and it
really<00:02:16.180> plummets<00:02:17.250> precipitously<00:02:18.250> that's

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
really plummets precipitously that's

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.540 
really plummets precipitously that's
when<00:02:19.600> those<00:02:19.780> cravings<00:02:20.410> get<00:02:20.650> very<00:02:20.890> very<00:02:21.160> strong

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
when those cravings get very very strong

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.080 
when those cravings get very very strong
so<00:02:22.240> why<00:02:22.810> would<00:02:23.110> blood<00:02:23.350> sugar<00:02:23.620> do<00:02:23.950> that<00:02:24.160> number

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
so why would blood sugar do that number

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.900 
so why would blood sugar do that number
one<00:02:25.300> is<00:02:25.450> just<00:02:25.630> a<00:02:25.780> poor<00:02:26.050> diet<00:02:26.490> number<00:02:27.490> two<00:02:27.700> is

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
one is just a poor diet number two is

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.520 
one is just a poor diet number two is
not<00:02:28.090> knowing<00:02:28.510> you<00:02:28.600> have<00:02:28.870> certain<00:02:29.260> food

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
not knowing you have certain food

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.070 
not knowing you have certain food
intolerances<00:02:29.980> so<00:02:30.970> you're<00:02:31.180> eating<00:02:31.540> food<00:02:31.840> it's

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
intolerances so you're eating food it's

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.260 
intolerances so you're eating food it's
not<00:02:32.260> really<00:02:32.530> turning<00:02:32.800> into<00:02:33.010> good<00:02:33.340> fuel<00:02:33.640> for

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
not really turning into good fuel for

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.930 
not really turning into good fuel for
you<00:02:34.620> gluten<00:02:35.620> is<00:02:35.739> a<00:02:35.770> perfect<00:02:36.250> example<00:02:36.370> of<00:02:36.880> that

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
you gluten is a perfect example of that

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.240 
you gluten is a perfect example of that
not<00:02:37.720> only<00:02:37.900> are<00:02:38.050> you<00:02:38.200> not<00:02:38.290> turning<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:38.890> gluten

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
not only are you not turning the gluten

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.940 
not only are you not turning the gluten
itself<00:02:39.610> into<00:02:40.000> good<00:02:40.630> fuel<00:02:40.959> but<00:02:41.590> because<00:02:41.920> of

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
itself into good fuel but because of

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.949 
itself into good fuel but because of
what<00:02:42.100> gluten<00:02:42.520> does<00:02:42.819> to<00:02:43.030> your<00:02:43.090> small<00:02:43.390> intestine

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
what gluten does to your small intestine

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.410 
what gluten does to your small intestine
causing<00:02:44.380> so<00:02:44.560> much<00:02:44.709> inflammation<00:02:45.269> you're<00:02:46.269> not

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
causing so much inflammation you're not

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.449 
causing so much inflammation you're not
even<00:02:46.750> absorbing<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.320> other<00:02:47.500> good<00:02:47.800> food<00:02:48.070> that

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
even absorbing the other good food that

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.520 
even absorbing the other good food that
you're<00:02:48.670> eating<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:49.810> other<00:02:49.959> thing<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.290> can

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
you're eating the other thing that can

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.380 
you're eating the other thing that can
happen<00:02:50.560> for<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.340> gluten<00:02:51.640> intolerant<00:02:52.239> people

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
happen for the gluten intolerant people

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.720 
happen for the gluten intolerant people
is<00:02:52.840> that<00:02:53.110> they<00:02:53.350> remove<00:02:53.920> gluten<00:02:54.370> which<00:02:54.550> is

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
is that they remove gluten which is

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.820 
is that they remove gluten which is
tough<00:02:55.090> there's<00:02:55.420> no<00:02:55.570> two<00:02:55.630> ways<00:02:55.810> about<00:02:56.170> that<00:02:56.319> and

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
tough there's no two ways about that and

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.040 
tough there's no two ways about that and
then<00:02:57.400> there's<00:02:57.640> so<00:02:57.910> many<00:02:58.090> gluten<00:02:58.600> free<00:02:58.810> goodies

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
then there's so many gluten free goodies

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.660 
then there's so many gluten free goodies
available<00:02:59.709> now<00:02:59.860> that<00:03:00.130> they<00:03:00.250> find<00:03:00.489> themselves

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
available now that they find themselves

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.660 
available now that they find themselves
eating<00:03:01.269> more<00:03:01.810> cakes<00:03:02.140> and<00:03:02.380> cookies<00:03:02.560> and<00:03:03.010> treats

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
eating more cakes and cookies and treats

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.840 
eating more cakes and cookies and treats
than<00:03:04.480> they<00:03:04.690> ever<00:03:04.900> did<00:03:05.260> before<00:03:06.010> they<00:03:06.519> remove

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
than they ever did before they remove

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.000 
than they ever did before they remove
gluten<00:03:07.239> just<00:03:07.480> because<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.380> whole<00:03:08.530> focus<00:03:08.920> is

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
gluten just because the whole focus is

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.460 
gluten just because the whole focus is
gluten-free<00:03:09.400> gluten-free<00:03:09.730> gluten-free<00:03:10.470> and

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
gluten-free gluten-free gluten-free and

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.430 
gluten-free gluten-free gluten-free and
and<00:03:11.800> maybe<00:03:12.130> not<00:03:12.459> so<00:03:13.239> much<00:03:13.540> as<00:03:13.780> it<00:03:13.930> should<00:03:14.140> be<00:03:14.319> of

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
and maybe not so much as it should be of

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.470 
and maybe not so much as it should be of
what's<00:03:14.709> all<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.130> good<00:03:15.340> food<00:03:15.640> so<00:03:16.209> it's<00:03:16.360> like

good<00:03:30.850> nutrition<00:03:31.420> which<00:03:31.900> leads<00:03:32.230> me<00:03:32.380> into<00:03:32.590> the

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
good nutrition which leads me into the

good nutrition which leads me into the
next<00:03:32.890> major<00:03:33.400> point<00:03:33.880> that<00:03:34.120> we've<00:03:34.269> realized

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
next major point that we've realized

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.020 
next major point that we've realized
here<00:03:34.900> at<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.079> clinic<00:03:35.320> and<00:03:35.650> that<00:03:36.190> is<00:03:36.459> that<00:03:36.820> the

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
here at the clinic and that is that the

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.479 
here at the clinic and that is that the
consumption<00:03:37.540> of<00:03:37.750> adequate<00:03:38.620> vegetables<00:03:39.250> and

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
consumption of adequate vegetables and

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.720 
consumption of adequate vegetables and
fruits<00:03:39.880> is<00:03:40.140> sadly<00:03:41.140> sadly<00:03:41.709> lacking<00:03:42.280> in<00:03:42.579> our

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
fruits is sadly sadly lacking in our

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.750 
fruits is sadly sadly lacking in our
country<00:03:43.180> and<00:03:43.859> we've<00:03:44.859> heard<00:03:45.100> about<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.489> five

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
country and we've heard about the five

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.599 
country and we've heard about the five
servings<00:03:46.239> a<00:03:46.420> day<00:03:46.950> upon<00:03:47.950> research<00:03:48.370> I<00:03:48.579> found

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
servings a day upon research I found

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.789 
servings a day upon research I found
that<00:03:48.910> that<00:03:49.120> five<00:03:49.420> is<00:03:49.810> the<00:03:49.989> actually<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:50.620> bare

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
that that five is the actually the bare

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.500 
that that five is the actually the bare
minimum<00:03:51.040> it's<00:03:51.370> really<00:03:51.609> more<00:03:51.760> for<00:03:51.970> children

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
minimum it's really more for children

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.349 
minimum it's really more for children
and<00:03:52.720> sedentary<00:03:53.560> adults<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.670> typical<00:03:54.910> man

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
and sedentary adults the typical man

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:57.210 
and sedentary adults the typical man
needs<00:03:55.660> nine<00:03:56.049> servings<00:03:56.680> of<00:03:56.859> fruits<00:03:57.100> and

needs nine servings of fruits and
vegetables<00:03:57.310> that<00:03:58.000> would<00:03:58.120> be<00:03:58.180> five<00:03:58.480> veggies

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
vegetables that would be five veggies

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.949 
vegetables that would be five veggies
and<00:03:59.769> for<00:04:00.130> fruits<00:04:00.519> and<00:04:00.820> the<00:04:01.359> average<00:04:01.540> woman

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
and for fruits and the average woman

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.560 
and for fruits and the average woman
needs<00:04:01.989> seven<00:04:02.620> so<00:04:03.130> for<00:04:03.609> vegetables<00:04:04.150> and<00:04:04.329> three

here at the clinic is that as we work

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.860 
here at the clinic is that as we work
with<00:04:57.830> patients<00:04:58.009> more<00:04:58.520> and<00:04:58.639> more<00:04:58.849> to<00:04:59.000> get<00:04:59.240> that

with patients more and more to get that

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.140

00:05:05.019 --> 00:05:05.029 
their diet a very interesting thing

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:06.969 
their diet a very interesting thing

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
happens and that is that their sugar

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:09.070 
happens and that is that their sugar
cravings<00:05:07.520> go<00:05:07.789> away<00:05:08.120> they<00:05:08.629> feel<00:05:08.840> very

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
satisfied with what they're eating and

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.800 
satisfied with what they're eating and
it<00:05:12.680> was<00:05:12.949> a<00:05:12.979> certainly<00:05:13.669> nice<00:05:13.939> side<00:05:14.300> benefit

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
it was a certainly nice side benefit

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.480 
it was a certainly nice side benefit
from<00:05:14.990> getting<00:05:15.319> those<00:05:15.469> adequate<00:05:16.189> number<00:05:16.460> of

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
from getting those adequate number of

from getting those adequate number of
fruits<00:05:16.729> and<00:05:16.849> veggies<00:05:17.240> but<00:05:17.360> it<00:05:17.449> actually<00:05:17.659> makes

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
fruits and veggies but it actually makes

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.719 
fruits and veggies but it actually makes
a<00:05:18.139> lot<00:05:18.169> of<00:05:18.379> sense<00:05:18.500> when<00:05:18.919> you<00:05:19.009> think<00:05:19.039> about<00:05:19.400> it

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729 
a lot of sense when you think about it

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:22.029 
a lot of sense when you think about it
because<00:05:20.449> you're<00:05:20.659> now<00:05:20.839> nourishing<00:05:21.560> your<00:05:21.589> cells

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 
because you're now nourishing your cells

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:24.760 
because you're now nourishing your cells
and<00:05:22.400> when<00:05:22.909> that<00:05:23.060> sugar<00:05:23.419> sugar<00:05:24.110> monkeys<00:05:24.589> on

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
and when that sugar sugar monkeys on

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.159 
and when that sugar sugar monkeys on
your<00:05:24.919> back<00:05:25.159> saying<00:05:25.550> sugar<00:05:25.849> sugar<00:05:26.210> what<00:05:26.870> that's

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 
your back saying sugar sugar what that's

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:30.459 
your back saying sugar sugar what that's
really<00:05:27.639> translated<00:05:28.639> into<00:05:28.789> is<00:05:29.270> the<00:05:29.779> cells<00:05:30.110> of

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:30.469 
really translated into is the cells of

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:32.459 
really translated into is the cells of
your<00:05:30.560> body<00:05:30.979> saying<00:05:31.580> I'm<00:05:31.819> hungry<00:05:32.270> I'm<00:05:32.360> hungry

your body saying I'm hungry I'm hungry

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:35.679 
your body saying I'm hungry I'm hungry
where's<00:05:33.469> the<00:05:33.830> fuel<00:05:34.129> I<00:05:34.400> didn't<00:05:34.879> get<00:05:35.089> it<00:05:35.270> because

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:35.689 
where's the fuel I didn't get it because

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:37.929 
where's the fuel I didn't get it because
it<00:05:36.050> was<00:05:36.080> such<00:05:36.379> a<00:05:36.409> poor<00:05:36.889> form<00:05:37.250> of<00:05:37.399> nutrition

00:05:37.929 --> 00:05:37.939 
it was such a poor form of nutrition

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:40.089 
it was such a poor form of nutrition
that<00:05:38.060> you<00:05:38.210> consumed<00:05:38.750> as<00:05:38.990> those<00:05:39.649> fruits<00:05:39.949> and

that you consumed as those fruits and

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:42.490 
that you consumed as those fruits and
vegetables<00:05:40.550> go<00:05:40.789> up<00:05:41.060> those<00:05:41.719> cells<00:05:42.110> are<00:05:42.259> more

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:26.719 
progesterone deficiency is very very

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:29.619 
progesterone deficiency is very very
common<00:06:27.080> in<00:06:27.349> all<00:06:27.919> ages<00:06:28.490> this<00:06:28.939> can<00:06:29.180> start<00:06:29.479> with

a<00:06:44.669> lot<00:06:44.909> of<00:06:45.030> those<00:06:45.210> symptoms<00:06:45.990> that<00:06:46.409> we

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 
a lot of those symptoms that we

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.149 
a lot of those symptoms that we
associated<00:06:47.280> with<00:06:47.930> an<00:06:48.930> unhappy<00:06:49.590> menstrual

cycle are associated with deficiency and
progesterone<00:06:53.280> infertility<00:06:53.939> is<00:06:54.210> actually<00:06:54.689> in

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:54.870 
progesterone infertility is actually in

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.189 
progesterone infertility is actually in
there<00:06:55.080> and<00:06:55.349> miscarriages<00:06:56.069> as<00:06:56.340> well<00:06:56.639> so<00:06:57.419> that's

00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199 
there and miscarriages as well so that's

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:00.499 
there and miscarriages as well so that's
something<00:06:58.680> that<00:06:58.860> we<00:06:59.129> we<00:06:59.490> work<00:06:59.699> with<00:06:59.939> it<00:07:00.090> also

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:00.509 
something that we we work with it also

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:02.540 
something that we we work with it also
that's<00:07:01.139> very<00:07:01.259> very<00:07:01.620> important<00:07:02.159> because<00:07:02.219> what

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:02.550 
that's very very important because what

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.820 
that's very very important because what
progesterone<00:07:03.090> does<00:07:03.569> it<00:07:04.050> does<00:07:04.319> a<00:07:04.349> lot<00:07:04.620> of

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830 
progesterone does it does a lot of

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.439 
progesterone does it does a lot of
things<00:07:04.979> but<00:07:05.129> it's<00:07:05.340> what's<00:07:05.520> called<00:07:05.729> a<00:07:05.879> glucose

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:06.449 
things but it's what's called a glucose

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:08.749 
things but it's what's called a glucose
tolerance<00:07:06.840> factor<00:07:07.800> so<00:07:08.279> it's<00:07:08.520> going<00:07:08.699> to

00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:08.759 
tolerance factor so it's going to

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:11.749 
tolerance factor so it's going to
stabilize<00:07:09.659> that<00:07:10.020> blood<00:07:10.349> sugar<00:07:10.650> so<00:07:11.250> we<00:07:11.400> found

00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 
stabilize that blood sugar so we found

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:14.809 
stabilize that blood sugar so we found
that<00:07:12.090> in<00:07:12.360> certain<00:07:13.139> women<00:07:13.439> in<00:07:13.680> particular<00:07:13.819> that

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:14.819 
that in certain women in particular that

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:16.610 
that in certain women in particular that
was<00:07:15.060> a<00:07:15.090> missing<00:07:15.419> factor<00:07:16.020> and<00:07:16.139> as<00:07:16.229> soon<00:07:16.379> as<00:07:16.500> we

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:16.620 
was a missing factor and as soon as we

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.100 
was a missing factor and as soon as we
stabilize<00:07:17.189> that<00:07:17.370> progesterone<00:07:17.789> we<00:07:18.539> stabilize

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.110 
stabilize that progesterone we stabilize

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.350 
stabilize that progesterone we stabilize
blood<00:07:19.349> sugar<00:07:19.469> and<00:07:19.949> sugar<00:07:20.430> cravings<00:07:21.000> went<00:07:21.240> away

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 
blood sugar and sugar cravings went away

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.080 
blood sugar and sugar cravings went away
so<00:07:22.139> I<00:07:22.409> wanted<00:07:22.919> to<00:07:22.979> share<00:07:23.370> this<00:07:23.639> because<00:07:23.909> it's

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.090 
so I wanted to share this because it's

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.450
