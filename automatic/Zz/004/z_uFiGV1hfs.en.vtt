00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 how about friends I am fierce and we are in 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:09.030
 minecraft 1.6 point 4 to see a mod 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.740
 we have seen in the series powders 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.830
 flux something like that 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.179
 although we like harry potter are the 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.800
 same powders that were used to 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.970
 to have it archived eitb to be transported from 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.010
 back and forth, well, we're going to 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.900
 teach this mod that has little 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.470
 things but they are very interesting 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.740
 the first good thing that you see more than anything 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.649
 like where we can get the powders 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.920
 flux would not be very simple if we 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.250
 Let's get together to take a promise of 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.250
 character 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.750
 if we put together gunpowder with a 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.000
 pearl of leander would give us eight fruit 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.120
 power 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.330
 the powders flow and with these powders 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.480
 we could do two things in fact three 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:03.290
 we could character two things one would be 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.960
 the chimney posters and others 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.390
 it would be the torches the posters would be 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.780
 very simple would be we put a poster to 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.600
 side of 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.820
 in a little bit of this we would have a 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.040
 poster these green that would serve us 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.380
 to put the name of the fireplace and 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.780
 can differentiate them not without the poster the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.820
 chimney obviously would not work and the 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.290
 another would be the torches that with a 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.870
 normal stick and putting up 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.930
 a little bit as usual they are four 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.540
 torches these news have a couple 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.430
 of sympathetic things not once just 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.410
 they are decoration they do not do not 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.810
 much more 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:43.630
 illuminate and such is fine but let's go 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.450
 for having the green eyes that 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.770
 they do nothing else but yes that is 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.560
 nice because if we put 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.900
 here, nothing happens but if you see that 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.580
 we put it here next to the wall 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.960
 automatically hooks to the wall 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.960
 he does not want to be down 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.510
 I love there follows the normal 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.730
 sit down but not 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.650
 what would be said do not want to stay in 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.350
 the ground if they are right next to 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:14.740
 the wall you can not see they are jumping 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:18.700
 good let's continue with what we were going 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:21.100
 to see today in the manufacture of our 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.760
 chimneys to be able to teleport us 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.980
 very simple the one below where we are going to 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.380
 put on the fire always has to 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.530
 be brick me just work with me 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.230
 brick not that we expose two and two there 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.300
 and a here up there does not need to be 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.680
 they are a wall or you could put it 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:46.180
 right here and it would work the same not 11 11 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.940
 and here nine others what we are going to 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.610
 need are the posters for example 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.310
 here to put house 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:59.650
 and here I'm going to put 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:03.909
 for example married 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.620
 house 3 or house 2 well what next 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:08.200
 we would have to do taking the 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.110
 structure I've already put the poster would be 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.430
 with a lighter we would fire and 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:17.470
 we would be a little bit flux inside 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.390
 here to leave disabled and as 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.269
 you will see we would have ours and mine 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.500
 with its green color I'm going to take the 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.500
 creative way I'm going to get 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.280
 this is superiority 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.540
 and well I have made several several of these 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.100
 chimneys so you can see the 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.080
 operation but it's very simple a 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.140
 Once we get the fire and see no 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.700
 will be here the whole list to where 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.710
 we want to go for example in this case 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.750
 let's try married with bismillah 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.590
 teleported here automatically 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.200
 but we could choose what I know 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.390
 imagine a saved it and here 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.280
 we would have ours and poison the 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:59.959
 forest 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:02.810
 here we could do it we wanted to snow 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:05.209
 and we would have the snow and basically the 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.410
 operation is the same or is it a 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.230
 teleporter 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:14.780
 here we are in the jungle as you see no 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.780
 I have fallen by the miracle that I am like that 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.959
 of happy yo bueno 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.670
 and finally I who know the mine for 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.800
 that we can see 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.640
 how they light up then as you see 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:32.210
 the torches give enough light but 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:35.330
 they do not serve us for much anymore 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.220
 I say if you do not put here automatically 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.040
 the wall is pulled 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:43.760
 it's pretty funny but it's good 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:48.100
 what he has and finally, I 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:50.890
 I know we're going to look for a dungeon here 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.550
 so that it looks nice we live here without 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.550
 back isolated 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:01.020
 well basically this is the no way 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:05.030
 It has much more but if you look 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:08.610
 It gives a lot of itself so you could have go 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.020
 access to any location that 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.069
 you have found without having to 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:16.129
 leave your house or any little thing 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:18.900
 I hope you liked it, you know 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:21.569
 subscribe if you want more videos like and 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.320
 favorites that I like every one helps me 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:26.800
 mogollÃ³n 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.420
 and well I think that with this we 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.010
 we say goodbye and see you in the next 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.010
