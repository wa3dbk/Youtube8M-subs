00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 as the return of the holy son goes well 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:09.220
 is on the right track I do not want 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.950
 trust I want another opinion 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.960
 there are already many opinions that have given me 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.990
 the verbs that have told me that I can 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.210
 back to the ring 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.240
 only because many doctors tell me 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.660
 be careful that as soon as you stop 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:27.160
 then that's because it stops me 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.680
 because I am 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.619
 a lover of bumpers and is like my 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.870
 personal seal then the do not throw a 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.080
 butt to the best I'm going to do 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.480
 feel that I'm not giving 100% I have 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.480
 a new 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.510
 a new project new plan more than 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.090
 project against again going to 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.660
 states to see another doctor other 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.290
 doctors and if they also give me light 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.330
 green 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.490
 and I will return to my luchistic activity 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:04.839
 but I'm going to do it totally 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:06.909
 planned without haste choosing the squares 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.700
 maybe also thinking about what is 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.159
 time to say goodbye 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.899
 the return would already be imminent that would be 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.159
 a farewell tour of the son of 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.460
 holy 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.270
 I think if I think that if you look 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.399
 life sends you messages the body is 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.219
 very wise and if my body of some 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.800
 way he gave me this warning is for something not 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:31.550
 so 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:35.080
 I think we should understand that life 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:38.560
 it's by cycles things are 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:42.040
 for a while the fighters of yesteryear 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:46.090
 maybe they had a longer career 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:49.360
 because they fought more flush with canvas no no 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.640
 there were so many blows out of the river in the 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.400
 my father's case 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.890
 it came back I throw iron plates when in 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.180
 this championship in philippines to 20 a 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.380
 iron a Japanese channel that was 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:06.119
 defeated and took off and I crashed 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:09.420
 face of the nose then the wrestlers 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.940
 young people I think their careers every time 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.489
 they are going to be shorter because they 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.410
 expose and get hurt is how is the 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.260
 situation of your injury has been recorded in 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:23.670
 this time not the good news is to 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:28.590
 that the injury imagines that in the 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:31.290
 plates in the images of the injury is 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.590
 one a stain is not a stain on the 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.220
 spinal cord is not known what it is but 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.620
 there is a strange body there 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.069
 The good news is that they have passed to 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.060
 past more than a year 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.909
 and the new studies that I realized 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:55.030
 indicate that it is stagnating or is 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:57.400
 there it did not grow nor did it disappear 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.379
 but that means that the injury is 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.139
 that as the doctor explains, I do not know what 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:04.840
 I would know how to explain how I understood 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:07.480
 what is a scar or why? 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.840
 action then 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.110
 I need to get in the ring at the door 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.200
 closed and roll start doing 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.620
 movements and if I feel good and 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.530
 also have confidence because 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.240
 after so long and after 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.150
 regrettable 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:31.450
 the death of pedro aguayo juniors 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.430
 well, like you say you have to 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.680
 be careful because 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.200
 accidents because we can all be 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.230
 Well look obviously 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.319
 I would love to gather my classmates 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.040
 who have supported everything for everything 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:50.620
 names you already know them 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.159
 There are many of my colleagues who have been 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.810
 with us and obviously then hand 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:04:00.400
 black as referee 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:03.189
 navarro black terry have been part 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.010
 important of this company and its 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:08.709
 image as rediris has given you a 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.439
 respect for the fight because nobody touches them 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:14.260
 nobody dares to set them apart with respect 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:16.989
 and obviously names as he said of 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.639
 lonely the white angel as rivals 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:24.050
 wagner of the couple 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:26.730
 rayman seem faces all all all 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:30.260
 this group or lacan ramÃ­rez 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:34.130
 I want you to be with me nothing happened 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:37.910
 I would love it too now 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.950
 is giving this so imagine to go back to 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.530
 face with blue black panther can 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:46.130
 It would be wonderful, but this is already 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.690
 It's not in my hands but it all depends 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.820
 everything depends I do not want to overtake what 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:55.640
 better are my my ideas not like as 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:58.670
 good programmer that I consider myself to be 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:02.060
 because I do not do the programs thinking 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:04.160
 in me that I feel writing already and 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.370
 form my programs for everything by the 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:11.150
 everything as an amateur I imagine the 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:14.120
 people watching again when I was 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:17.570
 me these these encounters between the wave 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.160
 white and hurricanes blue demon or me 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.290
 I think about the audience so I think 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.990
 that people would really like that the 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.220
 son of the saint would say goodbye with his 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.820
 great rivals 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:32.500
 as a warrior force 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:36.130
 I do not know would be interesting but everything goes 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.810
 to depend on how I feel and hopefully 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.290
 we can do and there is still the step 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.820
 for your son if what happens is that I 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:46.990
 I want him to finish his career is very 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:48.240
 young is very young perhaps the campaign 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.800
 what 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.590
 let's see how 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.379
 with the trainings in japan and everything 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.990
 this was presented because the people 

00:05:55.379 --> 00:06:01.530
 He already wants to see him fight but he's barely going to 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:04.169
 finish high school go to 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:07.600
 enter the university and I do 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:10.840
 I finished a race like I did 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.330
 and maybe when he's halfway through 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.170
 of the race because since he starts 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.170
 take your first steps
