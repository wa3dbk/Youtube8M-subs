00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 very good to all kids here febres 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.480
 and in this new video I'm going to have a 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.519
 print that is called battle tracker that is 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.889
 a plugin that you will know lamas 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.440
 enough of you because it's a 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.830
 pretty global plugin that carries 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.310
 enough years already working to be 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.260
 more accurate 3 and well you will have used it 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.119
 All of that you will have seen all of them 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.779
 time with this project that we are going to do 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.500
 is to change the messages of deaths by 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.000
 example if we want a server 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.719
 and we kill someone is going to leave 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.489
 bracey works is line by night by 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.840
 example then with this project we can 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:46.170
 change and put fernando has been killed 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:51.860
 by night with his army with his sword 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:55.949
 for example or I know that breaks and 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:58.480
 was killed by a kripper or febres and 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.880
 fell from the top of the sky 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.829
 the messages so we can change it to 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:07.540
 more this plugin is very good because you 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:09.460
 divide the messages into pvp and tve tvp es 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.290
 when reference is made to a death 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:16.300
 that was originated by another user 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:19.150
 for example I kill it willy rex 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.340
 would go out in pvp as you see here would come the 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.630
 prefix pvp and would leave fernando has killed 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.479
 willy kings and if a flu kills me 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.119
 I would leave pv 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.240
 and then it would leave because fernando has been 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:38.080
 killed by a kripper things well worth 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.660
 it's super well that of tve and pv but eye 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.039
 of pvp and pv 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.759
 also with this plugin we can put 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:49.000
 about six and some little signs are put 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.820
 the statistics the classification 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.150
 super well we are going to do it with pv and 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.580
 ccoo pv and here they say enough 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:03.330
 examples to put for example 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:05.610
 classification victories lost deaths 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.720
 and I know good this is the same 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:13.020
 that is good not cliché kills two ideas is 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.190
 death that there is I have confused and already 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.290
 is 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.300
 also this plugin works with others 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.510
 plugins for example with sand split 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.250
 things like this because this plugin 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.470
 also complements others then 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.140
 it's super good because in this project 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.950
 puts other plugin ranking by 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.960
 example of the splif who has been the one 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.520
 more has won in the split who has 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.020
 been the one that has won the most in paintball 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.990
 things like that 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.720
 with this we can do it 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:45.410
 and we're going to go here to the 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.830
 configuration this what is this of what 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.830
 I close 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:54.849
 this is the message this would be 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:58.989
 translate it speak spanish I know it's a 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.799
 Coñazo guys is a pain in the ass but there 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.230
 the Google 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.180
 the translator who does all this for 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.299
 you although they are very words 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.890
 simple and if you handle English then 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.200
 surely you know but with the 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.810
 translator you put everything is translated 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.379
 that they do have a lot of care 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:22.209
 here because for example here comes the and 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:25.840
 rare is 6 1% and one percent 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.639
 and the one you can never change never 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.209
 because if we change it what's going 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:32.360
 original is an owl and an elche bug is given 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.520
 the 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.740
 the plugin will not work, it's worth it 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.880
 goes to class until the minecraft but 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.500
 you have to be very careful just 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.110
 you can change them with the codes of 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.450
 colors that are here worth these are 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:49.010
 the color codes for example this 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:52.970
 it would have been killed by and I would put 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.830
 here he has been killed by 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.830
 and then for the colors we can 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:01.810
 change here we can with the 7 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:04.420
 Well this is the TV up even 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:09.129
 prefix we can change it too and if 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:11.069
 we go down the pvp and that's it 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:13.819
 we keep 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.530
 and now now I'm going to teach this the 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.570
 classifications these weird that this 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.479
 relationship I like more because in a 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.759
 pvp follower that you have fashion's 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:26.110
 this is tremendous because that's so clear 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:28.840
 original is that there 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.569
 quiet and piqueos to see who is the 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.490
 top you know to see who is the one who kills the most 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:35.050
 although with the score board as you see here 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.930
 to my right we can also do vale 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.439
 but it's better to see it in a cool poster 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:44.139
 more good up there always has to be 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:48.099
 pv and ccoo pv 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:50.469
 it's always worth down then we can use 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:52.750
 different types for example the rating 

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:55.350
 wing skills etc you have it classification 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.950
 I am going to put for example 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.870
 x 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.880
 for example and below I would have to put 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.040
 more little signs to come out 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.520
 example here the first efe breaks and the 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:09.670
 second game gamer the third one man pvp 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.160
 the fourth whatever so and always 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:15.330
 well down we want to put more 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:18.330
 then we put more if it will be by posters 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.790
 we put pvp 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:26.660
 low 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:29.600
 fuck fuck now pvp yo that i know díaz and 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:32.660
 We put down this here right now no 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:35.030
 nothing comes to us because there has not been 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.920
 no deaths or anything because I followed 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.080
 this follower that I am in is in 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:42.110
 my computer and I only use it then 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.860
 There is nothing worth here, come out or out a team 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:50.300
 but it should come out like here in 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:52.580
 the photo should come out like this 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.080
 that nothing kids this is the plugin already 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.300
 you know, you will know a lot of 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.670

 a plugin to put me in the comments 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.850

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:28.000
