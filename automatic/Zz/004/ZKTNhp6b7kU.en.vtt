for<00:01:49.259> me<00:01:49.590> at<00:01:49.740> least<00:01:49.770> when<00:01:50.220> I'm<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.180> winter

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
for me at least when I'm in the winter

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.440 
for me at least when I'm in the winter
because<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.720> do<00:01:51.840> self<00:01:52.170> tan<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> little<00:01:52.649> bit<00:01:53.450> but

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
because I do self tan a little bit but

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.179 
because I do self tan a little bit but
not<00:01:54.509> very<00:01:54.899> much<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.500> I'm<00:01:55.560> still<00:01:55.799> pretty<00:01:55.920> pale

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
not very much so I'm still pretty pale

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.240 
not very much so I'm still pretty pale
so<00:01:56.579> it's<00:01:57.229> enough<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.380> give<00:01:58.500> me<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.619> glow<00:01:58.890> but<00:01:59.130> not

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
so it's enough to give me a glow but not

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.620 
so it's enough to give me a glow but not
too<00:01:59.399> much<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.700> glow<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.479> definitely

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
too much of a glow so I definitely

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.179 
too much of a glow so I definitely

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.280 
look so again I like this for an
all-over<00:02:28.060> bronzer<00:02:28.630> I<00:02:28.660> think<00:02:28.960> it's<00:02:29.080> really

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
all-over bronzer I think it's really

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.830 
all-over bronzer I think it's really
pretty<00:02:32.100> there<00:02:33.100> is<00:02:33.340> above<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.910> rim<00:02:34.210> 01<00:02:34.510> so

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
pretty there is above the rim 01 so

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.990 
pretty there is above the rim 01 so
that's<00:02:34.990> a<00:02:35.080> ripple<00:02:35.350> one<00:02:35.500> that's<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.550> next<00:02:36.820> one

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
darker or these two so this is the

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.510 
darker or these two so this is the
darkest<00:04:22.210> color<00:04:22.500> second<00:04:23.500> darkest<00:04:23.830> their

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
darkest color second darkest their

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.710

darkest and this is

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.500 
darkest and this is
the<00:04:25.810> lightest<00:04:26.530> one<00:04:26.770> and<00:04:27.370> that's<00:04:28.240> what<00:04:28.420> they

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
the lightest one and that's what they

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.650 
the lightest one and that's what they
look<00:04:28.690> like<00:04:28.750> all<00:04:29.080> swirled<00:04:29.800> together<00:04:30.040> so<00:04:31.000> it's

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
look like all swirled together so it's

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.150 
look like all swirled together so it's
another<00:04:31.930> pretty<00:04:32.230> dark<00:04:32.470> brown<00:04:32.650> sir<00:04:32.800> I<00:04:32.860> like<00:04:33.040> to

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
use this to contour or think it'd be

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.830

great<00:04:36.220> in<00:04:36.340> the<00:04:36.400> summer<00:04:36.580> so<00:04:37.060> as<00:04:37.180> I<00:04:37.390> think<00:04:37.660> this

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
great in the summer so as I think this

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.970 
great in the summer so as I think this
is<00:04:37.900> around<00:04:38.680> nine<00:04:39.040> dollars<00:04:39.810> and<00:04:40.810> last<00:04:41.800> but

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
is around nine dollars and last but

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.670 
is around nine dollars and last but
certainly<00:04:42.160> not<00:04:42.880> least<00:04:43.120> I<00:04:43.870> have<00:04:44.140> my<00:04:44.170> all-time

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
certainly not least I have my all-time

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.170 
certainly not least I have my all-time
favorite<00:04:45.310> bronzer<00:04:45.460> this<00:04:45.760> is<00:04:45.880> the<00:04:45.970> one<00:04:46.060> I've

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
favorite bronzer this is the one I've

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.060 
favorite bronzer this is the one I've
been<00:04:46.210> wearing<00:04:46.480> since<00:04:46.900> I<00:04:47.080> started<00:04:47.740> wearing

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
makeup which in retrospect I guess

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.560
