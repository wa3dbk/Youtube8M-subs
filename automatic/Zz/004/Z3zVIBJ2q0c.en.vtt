ideas<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:19.460> recently<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.550> got<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.789> kit<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.060> was

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
ideas and recently I got a kit that was

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.090 
ideas and recently I got a kit that was
fairly<00:00:21.510> cheap<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.170> decided<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.650> use<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:23.070> to

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
fairly cheap and I decided to use it to

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.400 
fairly cheap and I decided to use it to
create<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:23.640> kit<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.180> decided<00:00:24.840> on<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.050> gun<00:00:25.199> can

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
create this kit I decided on the gun can

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.689 
create this kit I decided on the gun can
because<00:00:25.680> there<00:00:25.769> are<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.859> lot<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.070> variations<00:00:26.580> on

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
because there are a lot of variations on

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.130 
because there are a lot of variations on
the<00:00:26.789> Gundam<00:00:27.150> but<00:00:27.330> not<00:00:27.510> as<00:00:27.630> many<00:00:27.779> on<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:27.990> gun

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
the Gundam but not as many on the gun

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.689 
the Gundam but not as many on the gun
can<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.529> thought<00:00:28.740> it'd<00:00:28.830> be<00:00:28.859> fun<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.490> let's

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
can and I thought it'd be fun so let's

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.990 
can and I thought it'd be fun so let's
have<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.660> look<00:00:30.689> see<00:00:30.840> what<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.140> did<00:00:31.700> now<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.759> main

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
cannons this hand cannon is so huge that

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.260 
cannons this hand cannon is so huge that
it's<00:04:44.620> pretty<00:04:44.800> much<00:04:44.919> takes<00:04:45.130> two<00:04:45.400> hands<00:04:45.970> to<00:04:46.090> hold

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:52.589 
it and the one on the shoulder is on a
double<00:04:51.370> hinge<00:04:51.639> so<00:04:52.000> it'll<00:04:52.210> move<00:04:52.300> just<00:04:52.510> about

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:52.599 
double hinge so it'll move just about

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:56.159 
double hinge so it'll move just about
anywhere<00:04:53.200> I<00:04:53.260> want<00:04:54.120> it<00:04:55.120> will<00:04:55.360> straight<00:04:55.720> up<00:04:55.750> or<00:04:56.110> I

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
anywhere I want it will straight up or I

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.740 
anywhere I want it will straight up or I
can<00:04:56.380> fold<00:04:56.590> it<00:04:56.650> to<00:04:56.770> the<00:04:56.860> back<00:04:57.330> and<00:04:58.330> you<00:04:58.389> can<00:04:58.630> see

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
can fold it to the back and you can see

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.300 
can fold it to the back and you can see
I<00:04:58.780> added<00:04:59.110> the<00:04:59.169> machine<00:04:59.500> gun<00:04:59.770> on<00:04:59.919> top<00:05:00.099> of<00:05:00.220> that

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
I added the machine gun on top of that

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.170 
I added the machine gun on top of that
cannon<00:05:01.979> but<00:05:02.979> I<00:05:03.010> won't<00:05:03.220> get<00:05:03.340> much<00:05:03.550> pose<00:05:03.789> ability

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
cannon but I won't get much pose ability

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.600 
cannon but I won't get much pose ability
out<00:05:04.300> of<00:05:04.450> the<00:05:04.510> hand<00:05:04.780> cannon<00:05:05.169> it's<00:05:05.710> just<00:05:06.010> so<00:05:06.190> huge

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
out of the hand cannon it's just so huge

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.570 
out of the hand cannon it's just so huge
and<00:05:07.110> the<00:05:08.110> tanks<00:05:08.440> on<00:05:08.530> the<00:05:08.620> back<00:05:08.800> i<00:05:08.830> repainted

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
and the tanks on the back i repainted

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.529 
and the tanks on the back i repainted
and<00:05:09.729> I<00:05:09.820> titanium<00:05:10.539> silver<00:05:10.930> and<00:05:12.180> I<00:05:13.180> think<00:05:13.419> that

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
and I titanium silver and I think that

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:14.760 
and I titanium silver and I think that
kind<00:05:13.720> of<00:05:13.750> looks<00:05:13.930> good<00:05:14.139> against<00:05:14.440> the<00:05:14.530> black

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
kind of looks good against the black

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.779 
kind of looks good against the black
background<00:05:14.800> and<00:05:16.860> i<00:05:17.860> held<00:05:18.099> that<00:05:18.160> on<00:05:18.400> with<00:05:18.580> green

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
background and i held that on with green

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:23.909 
background and i held that on with green
stuff<00:05:19.030> as<00:05:19.180> well<00:05:21.599> and<00:05:22.599> you<00:05:23.020> see<00:05:23.260> the<00:05:23.440> final

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
stuff as well and you see the final

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.190 
stuff as well and you see the final
product<00:05:24.130> I've<00:05:24.460> added<00:05:24.940> a<00:05:25.270> little<00:05:25.479> cable<00:05:25.840> that

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
product I've added a little cable that

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.320 
product I've added a little cable that
runs<00:05:26.229> from<00:05:26.530> the<00:05:26.770> gun<00:05:27.099> to<00:05:27.340> the<00:05:27.460> backpack<00:05:27.940> so

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
runs from the gun to the backpack so

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.070 
runs from the gun to the backpack so
this

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
this

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.779 
this
give<00:05:29.289> the<00:05:29.379> illusion<00:05:29.530> either<00:05:29.919> a<00:05:29.979> flame<00:05:30.400> floor

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:30.789 
give the illusion either a flame floor

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.839 
give the illusion either a flame floor
or<00:05:31.509> a<00:05:31.599> hyper<00:05:31.870> mega<00:05:32.139> launcher<00:05:32.620> not<00:05:33.520> sure<00:05:33.669> which

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:33.849 
or a hyper mega launcher not sure which

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:35.820 
or a hyper mega launcher not sure which
like<00:05:34.629> I<00:05:34.720> said<00:05:34.780> to<00:05:34.900> put<00:05:35.050> a<00:05:35.080> machine<00:05:35.379> gun<00:05:35.560> on<00:05:35.650> top

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
like I said to put a machine gun on top

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.129 
like I said to put a machine gun on top
of<00:05:35.919> that<00:05:35.979> cannon<00:05:36.430> painted<00:05:37.360> the<00:05:37.419> barrel<00:05:37.719> silver

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 
of that cannon painted the barrel silver

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:43.140 
of that cannon painted the barrel silver
so<00:05:38.319> it's<00:05:38.439> a<00:05:38.500> little<00:05:38.590> different<00:05:40.469> and<00:05:41.909> I<00:05:42.909> added

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
so it's a little different and I added

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.529 
so it's a little different and I added
the<00:05:43.360> name<00:05:43.539> rhino<00:05:43.900> to<00:05:44.139> the<00:05:44.439> ankle<00:05:44.889> armor<00:05:45.539> kinda

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539 
the name rhino to the ankle armor kinda

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:49.260 
the name rhino to the ankle armor kinda
like<00:05:46.750> the<00:05:46.960> Gundam<00:05:47.680> nt1<00:05:48.250> how<00:05:48.400> they<00:05:48.520> put<00:05:48.729> Alex<00:05:49.090> on

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
like the Gundam nt1 how they put Alex on

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.600 
like the Gundam nt1 how they put Alex on
the<00:05:49.389> shield<00:05:49.629> this<00:05:50.020> little<00:05:50.379> paint<00:05:50.949> it<00:05:51.069> on<00:05:51.159> rhino

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
the shield this little paint it on rhino

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.240 
the shield this little paint it on rhino
is<00:05:52.030> a<00:05:52.509> little<00:05:52.750> something<00:05:53.020> fun<00:05:53.229> add<00:05:53.830> a<00:05:53.889> little

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
is a little something fun add a little

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.869 
is a little something fun add a little
red<00:05:54.909> to<00:05:55.150> the<00:05:55.210> end<00:05:55.389> of<00:05:55.539> the<00:05:55.599> barrel<00:05:55.750> there<00:05:56.110> so

00:05:56.869 --> 00:05:56.879 
red to the end of the barrel there so

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:59.820 
red to the end of the barrel there so
kind<00:05:57.879> of<00:05:57.939> gives<00:05:58.090> it<00:05:58.120> a<00:05:58.210> more<00:05:58.330> weapon<00:05:58.750> feel<00:05:59.020> but

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
kind of gives it a more weapon feel but

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:07.589
