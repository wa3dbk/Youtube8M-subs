to Houdini visual effects in this

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.830 
to Houdini visual effects in this
exercise<00:00:16.109> we<00:00:17.039> will<00:00:17.070> be<00:00:17.430> touching<00:00:17.880> on<00:00:18.330> quite<00:00:18.810> a

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
exercise we will be touching on quite a

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.710 
exercise we will be touching on quite a
few<00:00:18.960> different<00:00:19.560> areas<00:00:19.890> within<00:00:20.130> Houdini<00:00:20.720> none

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
few different areas within Houdini none

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.450 
few different areas within Houdini none
of<00:00:21.750> them<00:00:21.960> will<00:00:22.109> be<00:00:22.289> particularly<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.160> depth

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
of them will be particularly in depth

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.519 
of them will be particularly in depth
but<00:00:24.150> will<00:00:24.269> hopefully<00:00:24.480> give<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.140> good<00:00:25.500> idea

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
but will hopefully give you a good idea

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.160 
but will hopefully give you a good idea
of<00:00:25.920> how<00:00:26.099> Dini<00:00:26.340> works<00:00:26.670> together<00:00:26.939> as<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.539> complete

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
of how Dini works together as a complete

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.700 
of how Dini works together as a complete
procedural<00:00:28.890> system<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.269> spheres<00:00:30.710> starts

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
procedural system so the spheres starts

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.290 
procedural system so the spheres starts
at<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.579> left<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:34.190> then<00:00:35.190> bang<00:00:35.610> bang<00:00:35.850> bang<00:00:36.059> bang

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
at the left and then bang bang bang bang

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.110 
at the left and then bang bang bang bang
it's<00:00:36.510> going<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.719> fire<00:00:37.610> bullets<00:00:38.610> along<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
it's going to fire bullets along the

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.150 
it's going to fire bullets along the
length<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.629> car<00:00:40.280> till<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.399> end<00:00:43.100> so<00:00:44.100> I'm

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
length of the car till the end so I'm

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.590 
length of the car till the end so I'm
just<00:00:44.309> going<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.489> go<00:00:44.610> back<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.789> frame<00:00:45.090> one<00:00:45.300> here

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
just going to go back to frame one here

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.170 
just going to go back to frame one here
now<00:00:46.050> we're<00:00:46.289> going<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.590> add<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.550> collision

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
now we're going to add the collision

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.660 
now we're going to add the collision
object<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:49.500> add<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.710> collision<00:00:50.160> object<00:00:50.579> to

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
object to add the collision object to

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.560 
object to add the collision object to
this<00:00:50.820> I'm<00:00:51.120> going<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.510> go<00:00:51.629> under<00:00:51.989> dr<00:00:52.530> particles

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
this I'm going to go under dr particles

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.630 
this I'm going to go under dr particles
click<00:00:54.570> on<00:00:54.600> collision<00:00:55.530> notice<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.520> it

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
click on collision notice that it

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.090 
click on collision notice that it
automatically<00:00:57.420> puts<00:00:57.570> me<00:00:58.050> back<00:00:58.230> into<00:00:58.559> object

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
automatically puts me back into object

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.240 
automatically puts me back into object
select<00:00:59.460> mode<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.420> if<00:01:00.840> detected<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:01.980> was

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
select mode so if detected that I was

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.310 
select mode so if detected that I was
not<00:01:02.520> at<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.940> object<00:01:03.390> level<00:01:03.600> in<00:01:03.899> other<00:01:04.049> words<00:01:04.229> I

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
not at the object level in other words I

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.780 
not at the object level in other words I
wasn't<00:01:04.619> looking<00:01:04.830> at<00:01:04.920> objects<00:01:05.339> i<00:01:05.460> was<00:01:05.580> looking

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
wasn't looking at objects i was looking

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.210 
wasn't looking at objects i was looking
at<00:01:05.850> particles<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:07.140> put<00:01:07.320> me<00:01:07.439> back<00:01:07.650> into<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
at particles and it put me back into the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.160 
at particles and it put me back into the
object<00:01:08.580> level<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:09.030> select<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.750> i'm

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
object level to select that and i'm

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.080 
object level to select that and i'm
going<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.439> select<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.860> grid<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.369> you'll

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
going to select the grid and you'll

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.060 
going to select the grid and you'll
notice<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> blue<00:01:12.869> prompt<00:01:13.619> at<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.770> bottom

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
notice in the blue prompt at the bottom

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.920 
notice in the blue prompt at the bottom
it<00:01:14.159> says<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.520> hit<00:01:14.700> enter<00:01:15.030> when<00:01:15.210> i'm<00:01:15.299> done<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.900> i

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
it says to hit enter when i'm done so i

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.850 
it says to hit enter when i'm done so i
will<00:01:16.140> do<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.729> now<00:01:17.729> when<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:17.939> press<00:01:18.180> play

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
will do that and now when I press play

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.859 
will do that and now when I press play
my<00:01:19.860> particles<00:01:20.400> fire<00:01:20.790> hit<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.299> grid<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.780> then

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
my particles fire hit the grid and then

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.770 
my particles fire hit the grid and then
they<00:01:21.990> bounce<00:01:22.200> back<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.740> under<00:01:23.580> behavior<00:01:24.240> for

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
they bounce back so under behavior for

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.600 
they bounce back so under behavior for
collision<00:01:25.229> I'm<00:01:25.380> going<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.710> change<00:01:25.950> bounce<00:01:26.340> on

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
collision I'm going to change bounce on

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.390 
collision I'm going to change bounce on
collision<00:01:27.060> which<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.450> default<00:01:27.680> to<00:01:28.680> stick

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
collision which is the default to stick

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.719 
collision which is the default to stick
on<00:01:29.610> collision<00:01:30.650> so<00:01:31.650> now<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.130> particles<00:01:32.579> hit

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
on collision so now is the particles hit

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.140 
on collision so now is the particles hit
the<00:01:32.880> grid<00:01:33.119> they<00:01:33.570> stick<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.560> grid<00:01:34.740> itself

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
the grid they stick to the grid itself

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.420 
the grid they stick to the grid itself
and<00:01:36.150> that's<00:01:37.110> all<00:01:37.259> I'm<00:01:37.350> going<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.530> do<00:01:37.740> I'm<00:01:37.950> just

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
and that's all I'm going to do I'm just

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.920 
and that's all I'm going to do I'm just
going<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.579> leave<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.880> render<00:01:39.210> display<00:01:39.240> flags

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
going to leave the render display flags

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.249 
going to leave the render display flags
on<00:01:40.140> here<00:01:40.470> type<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.400> or<00:01:41.700> just<00:01:41.909> click<00:01:42.119> on<00:01:42.240> obj<00:01:42.899> go

on here type you or just click on obj go
back<00:01:43.439> up<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.799> top<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.280> now<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:44.909> have<00:01:45.270> each

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
back up to the top and now I have each

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.889 
back up to the top and now I have each
of<00:01:45.869> my<00:01:46.049> objects<00:01:46.759> in<00:01:48.619> side<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.649> their<00:01:50.009> own

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.480 
of my objects in side of their own
object<00:01:51.899> node<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:52.979> turn<00:01:53.130> off<00:01:53.340> the

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
object node so I can turn off the

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.120 
object node so I can turn off the
display<00:01:53.670> for<00:01:54.180> gun<00:01:54.390> for<00:01:54.659> example<00:01:54.829> if<00:01:55.829> we<00:01:55.950> don't

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
display for gun for example if we don't

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.030 
display for gun for example if we don't
want<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.340> get<00:01:56.460> have<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.180> way<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:58.040> I

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
want to get have that in the way and I

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.340 
want to get have that in the way and I
can<00:01:59.189> even<00:01:59.280> turn<00:01:59.520> off<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.850> bullet<00:02:00.119> holes<00:02:00.329> or<00:02:01.290> I

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
can even turn off the bullet holes or I

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.010 
can even turn off the bullet holes or I
can<00:02:01.740> turn<00:02:01.770> off<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.250> grid<00:02:02.549> or<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:03.299> can<00:02:03.659> turn<00:02:03.689> off

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
can turn off the grid or I can turn off

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.730 
can turn off the grid or I can turn off
the<00:02:04.200> sparks<00:02:05.570> so<00:02:06.570> by<00:02:06.840> doing<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.380> this<00:02:07.500> manner

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
the sparks so by doing it in this manner

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.510 
the sparks so by doing it in this manner
I've<00:02:08.129> given<00:02:09.060> us<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.390> control<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:10.520> shade

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
I've given us the control to shade

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.730 
I've given us the control to shade
display<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.209> render<00:02:12.569> all<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.110> different

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
display and render all of the different

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.700 
display and render all of the different
separately<00:02:14.480> what<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.510> just<00:02:15.810> jumped<00:02:16.140> out<00:02:16.290> so

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
separately what I just jumped out so

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.440 
separately what I just jumped out so
this<00:02:17.010> acts<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.340> lot<00:02:17.460> like<00:02:17.520> firefox<00:02:18.210> or<00:02:18.420> internet

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
this acts a lot like firefox or internet

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.900 
this acts a lot like firefox or internet
explorer<00:02:19.200> in<00:02:19.440> that<00:02:20.100> you<00:02:20.220> can<00:02:20.400> jump<00:02:20.670> back

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
explorer in that you can jump back

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.310 
explorer in that you can jump back
through<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.360> history<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.840> what<00:02:22.170> you've

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
through the history of what you've

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.710 
through the history of what you've
looked<00:02:22.500> at<00:02:22.680> in<00:02:22.830> your<00:02:22.860> pains<00:02:23.240> some<00:02:24.240> people<00:02:24.540> can

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
looked at in your pains some people can

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.870 
looked at in your pains some people can
find<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.080> bit<00:02:25.140> confusing<00:02:25.710> when<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.730> get

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
find that a bit confusing when you get

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.220 
find that a bit confusing when you get
used<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.270> it's<00:02:27.510> extremely<00:02:28.050> powerful

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
used to it it's extremely powerful

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.560 
used to it it's extremely powerful
because<00:02:28.830> I<00:02:28.980> can<00:02:29.160> do<00:02:29.280> something<00:02:29.640> like<00:02:29.760> jump<00:02:30.420> in

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
because I can do something like jump in

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.510 
because I can do something like jump in
here<00:02:30.900> take<00:02:31.320> a<00:02:31.350> look<00:02:31.530> at<00:02:31.680> my<00:02:31.710> sparks<00:02:32.280> make<00:02:32.490> a

here take a look at my sparks make a
change<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.180> then<00:02:33.420> click<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.020> back<00:02:34.200> arrow<00:02:34.230> and

so<00:02:51.720> I'm<00:02:51.810> going<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:52.110> play<00:02:52.560> forward<00:02:52.950> until<00:02:53.100> I<00:02:53.250> can

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
so I'm going to play forward until I can

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.690 
so I'm going to play forward until I can
see<00:02:53.790> some<00:02:54.060> of<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.300> bullet<00:02:54.570> holes<00:02:55.550> I'm<00:02:56.550> going

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
see some of the bullet holes I'm going

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.310 
see some of the bullet holes I'm going
to<00:02:56.790> turn<00:02:56.970> off<00:02:57.210> the<00:02:57.420> collision<00:02:57.630> grid<00:02:58.140> and

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
to turn off the collision grid and

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.100 
to turn off the collision grid and
sparks<00:02:58.770> just<00:02:58.860> to<00:02:59.280> make<00:02:59.910> things<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.840> little<00:03:00.930> bit

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
sparks just to make things a little bit

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.740 
sparks just to make things a little bit
easier<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.500> see<00:03:01.710> in<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.920> viewport<00:03:02.100> and

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
easier to see in the viewport and

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.180 
easier to see in the viewport and
they'll<00:03:03.750> go<00:03:03.870> over<00:03:04.110> to<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.410> material<00:03:05.010> palette

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
they'll go over to the material palette

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.760 
they'll go over to the material palette
and<00:03:05.490> click<00:03:06.090> on<00:03:06.270> the<00:03:06.450> mantra<00:03:06.900> surface<00:03:07.500> node

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
and click on the mantra surface node

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.540 
and click on the mantra surface node
this<00:03:08.280> is<00:03:08.460> a<00:03:08.490> generic<00:03:09.000> all-in-one<00:03:09.900> shader<00:03:10.550> that

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
this is a generic all-in-one shader that

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.130 
this is a generic all-in-one shader that
generally<00:03:12.030> speaking<00:03:12.510> is<00:03:12.660> what<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:12.840> use<00:03:12.930> for

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
generally speaking is what I use for

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.280 
generally speaking is what I use for
everything<00:03:13.740> perfect<00:03:14.490> mirror<00:03:14.820> so<00:03:15.780> we<00:03:16.110> actually

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
everything perfect mirror so we actually

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.670 
everything perfect mirror so we actually
want<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.710> to<00:03:16.770> be<00:03:17.010> quite<00:03:17.340> subtle<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.240> large<00:03:18.780> so

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
want it to be quite subtle and large so

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.050 
want it to be quite subtle and large so
I'm<00:03:19.770> actually<00:03:19.860> going<00:03:20.070> to<00:03:20.220> turn<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.550> specular

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
I'm actually going to turn the specular

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.510 
I'm actually going to turn the specular
angle<00:03:21.420> fairly<00:03:22.200> high<00:03:22.410> turn<00:03:22.890> that<00:03:23.040> up<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.340> about

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
angle fairly high turn that up to about

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.680 
angle fairly high turn that up to about
14<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:25.370> get<00:03:26.370> quite<00:03:26.610> a<00:03:26.640> blurry<00:03:26.940> of<00:03:27.120> reflection

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
14 and get quite a blurry of reflection

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.540 
14 and get quite a blurry of reflection
on<00:03:27.810> there<00:03:30.500> don't<00:03:31.500> worry<00:03:31.740> about<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.310> quality

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
on there don't worry about the quality

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.300 
on there don't worry about the quality
of<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.240> grain<00:03:33.540> will<00:03:34.380> set<00:03:34.620> all<00:03:34.770> of<00:03:34.950> that<00:03:35.100> to

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
of the grain will set all of that to

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.220 
of the grain will set all of that to
maximum<00:03:35.850> quality<00:03:36.150> before<00:03:36.660> we<00:03:36.750> do<00:03:36.870> our<00:03:36.900> final

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
maximum quality before we do our final

maximum quality before we do our final
rendering<00:03:37.830> so<00:03:38.430> compositing<00:03:39.330> pretty

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
rendering so compositing pretty

to add the car reflection to the
background<00:03:57.390> and<00:03:57.870> we'll<00:03:57.990> take<00:03:58.140> a<00:03:58.170> look<00:03:58.320> at<00:03:58.470> that

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620

and<00:03:58.920> now<00:03:59.610> we<00:03:59.670> can<00:03:59.940> see<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.390> sparks<00:04:01.110> reflecting

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
and now we can see the sparks reflecting

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.890 
and now we can see the sparks reflecting
on<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.550> background<00:04:04.850> then<00:04:05.850> I'll<00:04:05.970> composite

on the background then I'll composite

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.980 
on the background then I'll composite
the<00:04:07.140> bullet<00:04:07.590> holes<00:04:07.800> using<00:04:08.700> a<00:04:09.030> comps<00:04:09.950> over

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
the bullet holes using a comps over

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.540 
the bullet holes using a comps over
which<00:04:12.990> is<00:04:13.140> the<00:04:13.350> most<00:04:13.470> standard<00:04:13.740> operator<00:04:14.340> uses

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
which is the most standard operator uses

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.550 
which is the most standard operator uses
the<00:04:14.880> alpha<00:04:15.180> channel<00:04:15.209> to<00:04:15.660> composite<00:04:15.990> one<00:04:16.320> thing

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
the alpha channel to composite one thing

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:24.050 
the alpha channel to composite one thing
over<00:04:16.859> another<00:04:16.950> and<00:04:19.220> then<00:04:20.220> finally<00:04:20.489> i<00:04:20.970> will<00:04:23.060> use

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
over another and then finally i will use

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.830 
over another and then finally i will use
another<00:04:24.540> ad

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
another ad

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.530 
another ad
to<00:04:26.800> add<00:04:26.949> the<00:04:26.980> sparks<00:04:27.699> because<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:28.120> sparks<00:04:28.419> are

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
to add the sparks because the sparks are

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.110 
to add the sparks because the sparks are
glowing<00:04:28.840> and<00:04:29.169> add<00:04:30.100> is<00:04:30.310> appropriate<00:04:30.880> in<00:04:31.000> this

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
glowing and add is appropriate in this

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.930 
glowing and add is appropriate in this
case<00:04:33.990> so<00:04:34.990> I<00:04:35.020> can<00:04:35.410> now<00:04:35.530> see<00:04:35.889> the<00:04:36.190> beginnings<00:04:36.820> of

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
case so I can now see the beginnings of

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.230 
case so I can now see the beginnings of
the<00:04:37.419> effect<00:04:37.870> a<00:04:38.139> lot<00:04:38.620> of<00:04:38.740> problems<00:04:39.130> already<00:04:39.370> we

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
the effect a lot of problems already we

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.090 
the effect a lot of problems already we
can<00:04:40.419> see<00:04:40.600> but<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:41.080> effect<00:04:41.350> is<00:04:41.470> starting<00:04:41.979> to

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
can see but the effect is starting to

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.000 
can see but the effect is starting to
come<00:04:42.310> together<00:04:42.780> okay<00:04:43.780> so<00:04:44.380> let's<00:04:44.620> take<00:04:44.770> a<00:04:44.800> look

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
come together okay so let's take a look

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.070 
come together okay so let's take a look
at<00:04:45.130> this<00:04:45.250> render<00:04:45.639> I'll<00:04:45.850> go<00:04:46.030> to<00:04:46.090> render<00:04:46.479> em<00:04:46.720> play

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
at this render I'll go to render em play

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.180 
at this render I'll go to render em play
low<00:04:47.380> disk<00:04:47.650> files<00:04:48.010> go<00:04:48.820> to<00:04:48.880> my<00:04:49.210> final<00:04:49.600> comp<00:04:49.870> and

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
low disk files go to my final comp and

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.070 
low disk files go to my final comp and
let's<00:04:51.190> take<00:04:51.430> a<00:04:51.490> look<00:04:51.729> well<00:04:52.510> the<00:04:52.630> bullet<00:04:52.780> holes

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
let's take a look well the bullet holes

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.689 
let's take a look well the bullet holes
are<00:04:53.229> in<00:04:53.290> the<00:04:53.410> right<00:04:53.530> place<00:04:53.590> they<00:04:54.400> certainly

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
are in the right place they certainly

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:56.340 
are in the right place they certainly
look<00:04:54.970> a<00:04:55.030> lot<00:04:55.150> more<00:04:55.210> interesting<00:04:55.660> they<00:04:56.169> did

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
look a lot more interesting they did

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.689 
look a lot more interesting they did
before<00:04:56.470> although<00:04:56.800> we<00:04:57.010> haven't<00:04:57.160> spent<00:04:57.460> any

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
before although we haven't spent any

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.300 
before although we haven't spent any
time<00:04:57.790> trying<00:04:58.330> to<00:04:58.419> shade<00:04:58.630> or<00:04:58.750> light<00:04:58.930> them<00:04:59.310> the

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
time trying to shade or light them the

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.510 
time trying to shade or light them the
sparks<00:05:00.639> are<00:05:01.000> I<00:05:01.680> think<00:05:02.680> a<00:05:02.770> bit<00:05:02.950> odd<00:05:03.160> because

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
sparks are I think a bit odd because

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.180 
sparks are I think a bit odd because
they're<00:05:03.790> moving<00:05:04.150> slower<00:05:04.570> than<00:05:04.870> the<00:05:05.190> motion

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
they're moving slower than the motion

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.530 
they're moving slower than the motion
blur<00:05:06.370> that<00:05:06.550> we<00:05:06.610> applied<00:05:07.060> to<00:05:07.240> them<00:05:07.389> would

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
blur that we applied to them would

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
blur that we applied to them would
warrant<00:05:07.810> the<00:05:08.110> effect<00:05:08.889> is<00:05:10.350> certainly<00:05:11.350> not

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
warrant the effect is certainly not

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.260 
warrant the effect is certainly not
photorealistic<00:05:12.220> but<00:05:12.639> is<00:05:12.760> heading<00:05:13.090> in<00:05:13.180> the

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
right direction for those that would

conclusion<00:05:17.340> you<00:05:18.340> could<00:05:18.580> adjust<00:05:18.820> the<00:05:19.300> motion

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780

blur<00:05:20.050> of<00:05:20.260> the<00:05:20.770> sparks<00:05:21.220> by<00:05:21.520> adjusting<00:05:21.820> the

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
blur of the sparks by adjusting the

blur of the sparks by adjusting the
multiplier<00:05:22.720> on<00:05:23.020> the<00:05:23.380> velocity<00:05:24.280> you<00:05:24.940> can<00:05:25.090> also

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
multiplier on the velocity you can also

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.210 
multiplier on the velocity you can also
go<00:05:25.479> into<00:05:25.630> the<00:05:25.810> material<00:05:26.110> for<00:05:26.650> the<00:05:26.800> bullet

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
go into the material for the bullet

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.430 
go into the material for the bullet
holes<00:05:27.400> and<00:05:27.669> adjust<00:05:28.600> those<00:05:28.780> as<00:05:28.990> well<00:05:29.169> and

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
holes and adjust those as well and

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.190 
holes and adjust those as well and
that's<00:05:30.430> basically<00:05:30.940> the<00:05:31.270> beauty<00:05:31.690> of<00:05:31.810> Houdini

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200
