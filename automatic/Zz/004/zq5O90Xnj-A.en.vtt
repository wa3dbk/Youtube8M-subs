00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.730
 from news.de and in new york at the 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.630
 press conference 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.290
 because here was just the new aspire 7 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.330
 presented 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:17.070
 this is a 15.6 inch notebook but how 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.170
 you can already recognize this directly 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.320
 very special loud buck we see here 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.150
 already the keyboard and the touchpad 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.380
 We were swapped times up here 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.869
 now the touchpad with the integrated 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.500
 mouse buttons and down here the chiclet 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.750
 Keyboard with the illuminated buttons 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.690
 why did he do it? 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.570
 we have the 15 6 inch here 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.969
 touchscreen display and that is on the 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.700
 special hinge we fastened 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.700
 So we can solve it here and us too 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.590
 just bring a bit forward 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.200
 already we have the keyboards closer 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.870
 the on display and then can 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.400
 For example, this is how women work on this 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.880
 Touchpad actually no longer because 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.840
 We are right here with fingers on 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.770
 display are 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.320
 if we are back to normal 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.360
 Of course that works too 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.370
 Just put the display back in the 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.720
 bring normal position and we can 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:16.160
 then continue to work as normal 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.100
 which is also beautiful by this special 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.900
 hinge then we can, for example 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.080
 work here and then the colleagues on 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.310
 the opposite side 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.710
 For example, document show 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.320
 Here how you can find this otherwise the 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.630
 display here turned a very nice 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.700
 idea or if you have the hinge then 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.710
 the display then up here just like that 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.900
 the middle has, for example, two 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.950
 people work simultaneously on here 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.190
 or counted 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.660
 you can see it holds too 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.850
 also looks pretty nice 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.950
 futuristic as you can see here 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.330
 no wonder that so first here with 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.280
 star trek entered into a partnership 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.710
 that looks pretty good for me 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.040
 enterprise from we look at the device 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.570
 now here again from the pages 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.230

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.520

 headphone jack or a 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.500

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.150

 we say we want an intel core i5 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.600
