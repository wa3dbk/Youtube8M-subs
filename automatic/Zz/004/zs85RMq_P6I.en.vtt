now<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:25.390> company<00:02:25.750> krill<00:02:26.020> essence<00:02:26.470> they

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
now the the company krill essence they

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.090 
now the the company krill essence they
sell<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.459> sentient<00:02:28.300> ones<00:02:28.540> but<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:29.470> already<00:02:29.709> had

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
sell the sentient ones but I already had

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.220 
sell the sentient ones but I already had
their<00:02:30.340> essential<00:02:30.730> oils<00:02:31.030> here<00:02:31.209> so<00:02:31.480> I<00:02:31.810> figured

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
their essential oils here so I figured

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.000 
their essential oils here so I figured
it<00:02:32.320> didn't<00:02:32.560> make<00:02:32.650> any<00:02:32.830> sense<00:02:33.070> to<00:02:33.280> order<00:02:34.180> more

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
it didn't make any sense to order more

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.030 
it didn't make any sense to order more
