know<00:00:26.789> one<00:00:27.029> versus<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.539> LED<00:00:27.960> one<00:00:28.320> just<00:00:28.830> said<00:00:29.070> it

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
know one versus the LED one just said it

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.130 
know one versus the LED one just said it
you<00:00:29.640> got<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.910> set<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.150> from<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.510> back<00:00:30.750> it's

you got to set it from the back it's

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.760 
you got to set it from the back it's
real<00:00:31.349> easy<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:31.740> cuz<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.219> pops<00:00:32.460> out<00:00:32.730> and

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
real easy so cuz it pops out and

real easy so cuz it pops out and
basically<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.980> take<00:00:35.219> out<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:35.700> little<00:00:36.000> thing

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
basically you take out this little thing

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.880 
basically you take out this little thing
here<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.960> there's<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.110> little<00:00:37.230> wheel<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:37.680> there

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
here and there's a little wheel in there

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.850 
here and there's a little wheel in there
and<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.760> turn<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.030> little<00:00:39.270> wheel<00:00:39.710> you<00:00:40.710> could

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
and you turn a little wheel you could

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.440 
and you turn a little wheel you could
see<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> little<00:00:41.399> red<00:00:41.550> wheel<00:00:41.879> if<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.180> got<00:00:42.329> to

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
see the little red wheel if you got to

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.110 
see the little red wheel if you got to
reset<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.989> clock<00:00:43.140> but<00:00:43.950> basically<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.520> pops

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
reset the clock but basically it pops

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.209 
reset the clock but basically it pops
out<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:45.480> that's<00:00:46.050> not<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.230> big<00:00:46.469> deal<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:49.219> three

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
out so that's not a big deal and three

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.130 
out so that's not a big deal and three
wires<00:00:50.489> there's<00:00:51.149> three<00:00:51.390> wires<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.870> didn't<00:00:52.079> know

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
wires there's three wires I didn't know

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.010 
wires there's three wires I didn't know

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.109 
it's a replacement clock for 20 bucks
versus<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:05.009> think<00:02:05.520> it's<00:02:05.640> just<00:02:05.939> some

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
versus I think it's just some

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.210 
versus I think it's just some
ridiculously<00:02:06.810> or<00:02:07.140> absorbent<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.710> price<00:02:08.009> from

got<00:02:40.569> a<00:02:40.599> clock<00:02:41.019> next<00:02:41.410> I'll<00:02:41.650> like<00:02:41.829> the<00:02:41.980> quartz

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
got a clock next I'll like the quartz

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.130 
got a clock next I'll like the quartz
clock<00:02:42.760> better<00:02:43.090> than<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.590> LED<00:02:44.590> anyway<00:02:45.069> so

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
clock better than the LED anyway so

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.770 
clock better than the LED anyway so
that's<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.230> little<00:02:47.349> more<00:02:47.620> functional<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.780> you

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
to put the three wires on it you know it

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.470 
to put the three wires on it you know it
seems<00:03:04.359> simple<00:03:04.900> but<00:03:04.930> I<00:03:05.519> was<00:03:06.519> like<00:03:06.670> I<00:03:06.940> was

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
seems simple but I was like I was

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.360 
seems simple but I was like I was
messing<00:03:08.170> around<00:03:08.349> with<00:03:08.560> this<00:03:08.680> tester<00:03:09.220> for

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
messing around with this tester for

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.550 
messing around with this tester for
about<00:03:09.579> 30<00:03:09.970> minutes<00:03:10.239> trying<00:03:11.079> to<00:03:11.200> make<00:03:11.349> sure<00:03:11.530> I

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
about 30 minutes trying to make sure I

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.170 
about 30 minutes trying to make sure I
had<00:03:11.829> it<00:03:11.980> right<00:03:12.160> and<00:03:12.400> actually<00:03:12.730> shorted

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
had it right and actually shorted

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.240 
had it right and actually shorted
something<00:03:13.359> out<00:03:13.690> blew<00:03:14.019> a<00:03:14.049> fuse<00:03:14.440> so<00:03:14.739> I<00:03:14.769> figured<00:03:15.190> I

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
something out blew a fuse so I figured I

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.130 
something out blew a fuse so I figured I
post<00:03:15.849> a<00:03:16.000> video<00:03:16.180> on<00:03:16.569> it<00:03:16.720> make<00:03:16.900> it<00:03:17.049> a<00:03:17.109> little

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
post a video on it make it a little

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.809 
post a video on it make it a little
easier<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:18.730> top<00:03:19.269> wire<00:03:19.599> goes<00:03:20.370> like<00:03:21.370> you<00:03:21.489> have

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
easier the top wire goes like you have

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.970 
easier the top wire goes like you have
three<00:03:22.030> wires<00:03:22.299> you<00:03:22.510> have<00:03:22.599> one<00:03:22.810> two<00:03:23.290> three

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
three wires you have one two three

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.289 
three wires you have one two three
that's<00:03:24.549> the<00:03:24.790> black<00:03:25.060> one<00:03:25.650> that's<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.889> red<00:03:27.099> one

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
that's the black one that's the red one

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.909 
that's the black one that's the red one
and<00:03:28.299> that's<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.660> orange<00:03:28.989> one<00:03:29.230> and<00:03:29.410> this<00:03:29.650> one's

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:29.919 
and that's the orange one and this one's

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:32.640 
and that's the orange one and this one's
not<00:03:30.160> used<00:03:30.489> down<00:03:31.120> here<00:03:31.389> it's<00:03:32.169> only<00:03:32.319> three

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
not used down here it's only three

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.699 
not used down here it's only three
prongs<00:03:32.980> so<00:03:33.250> it's<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.880> black<00:03:34.120> one<00:03:34.419> the<00:03:35.260> red<00:03:35.470> one

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
prongs so it's the black one the red one

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.650 
prongs so it's the black one the red one
in<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.130> orange<00:03:36.400> one<00:03:36.579> the<00:03:36.730> orange<00:03:36.880> one<00:03:37.239> is<00:03:37.450> with

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
to pull this out but you probably I

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:06.990

should<00:04:05.620> have<00:04:05.739> greased<00:04:06.010> this<00:04:06.220> before<00:04:06.609> I<00:04:06.639> put<00:04:06.879> it

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
should have greased this before I put it

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.520 
should have greased this before I put it
in<00:04:07.180> but<00:04:07.450> it<00:04:08.319> does<00:04:08.500> have<00:04:08.769> a<00:04:08.799> flush<00:04:09.519> fit<00:04:09.849> so<00:04:10.530> looks

in but it does have a flush fit so looks

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.319 
in but it does have a flush fit so looks
like<00:04:11.680> it<00:04:11.799> was<00:04:11.919> made<00:04:12.190> for<00:04:12.220> it<00:04:12.519> from<00:04:12.790> the<00:04:12.910> factory

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
like it was made for it from the factory

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.769 
like it was made for it from the factory
so<00:04:13.419> it's<00:04:13.810> not<00:04:13.959> bad<00:04:14.199> it's<00:04:14.410> not<00:04:14.470> bad
