one<00:00:07.020> of<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.169> most<00:00:07.379> important<00:00:07.859> techniques

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.540 
one of the most important techniques

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.210 
one of the most important techniques
that<00:00:08.660> you<00:00:08.840> can<00:00:09.019> learn<00:00:09.170> for<00:00:09.410> stand-up<00:00:09.830> paddling

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:10.220 
that you can learn for stand-up paddling

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.780 
that you can learn for stand-up paddling
it's<00:00:10.790> actually<00:00:11.300> how<00:00:11.540> to<00:00:11.570> lay<00:00:12.080> down<00:00:12.110> and<00:00:12.790> paddle

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:13.790 
it's actually how to lay down and paddle

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.150 
it's actually how to lay down and paddle
against<00:00:14.330> the<00:00:14.450> wind<00:00:14.690> if<00:00:15.320> the<00:00:15.530> wind<00:00:15.740> picks<00:00:16.010> up

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
against the wind if the wind picks up

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.890 
against the wind if the wind picks up
and<00:00:16.400> you<00:00:16.460> can<00:00:16.640> no<00:00:16.820> longer<00:00:17.090> move<00:00:17.390> forward

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
and you can no longer move forward

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.339 
and you can no longer move forward
you'll<00:00:18.650> want<00:00:18.890> to<00:00:19.040> lay<00:00:19.250> down<00:00:19.869> put<00:00:20.869> the<00:00:20.990> paddle

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:21.349 
you'll want to lay down put the paddle

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.729 
you'll want to lay down put the paddle
underneath<00:00:21.740> your<00:00:21.980> chest<00:00:22.279> and<00:00:23.349> alternate<00:00:24.349> with

00:00:24.729 --> 00:00:24.739 
underneath your chest and alternate with

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:26.620 
underneath your chest and alternate with
your<00:00:24.890> arms<00:00:25.250> right<00:00:25.520> and<00:00:25.759> left<00:00:26.029> to<00:00:26.270> paddle

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
your arms right and left to paddle

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.600 
your arms right and left to paddle
forward<00:00:26.989> so<00:00:27.649> that<00:00:27.800> you<00:00:27.890> can<00:00:28.070> actually<00:00:28.250> get

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:28.610 
forward so that you can actually get

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.690 
forward so that you can actually get
below<00:00:28.939> the<00:00:28.970> wind<00:00:29.390> and<00:00:29.660> make<00:00:30.140> some<00:00:30.410> way<00:00:30.649> back<00:00:31.489> to

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
below the wind and make some way back to

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.090 
below the wind and make some way back to
your<00:00:31.820> destination

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
your destination

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.130

another<00:00:34.100> way<00:00:34.370> to<00:00:34.430> paddle<00:00:35.059> should<00:00:35.600> you<00:00:35.750> need<00:00:35.930> to

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
another way to paddle should you need to

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.290 
another way to paddle should you need to
get<00:00:36.320> up<00:00:36.470> win<00:00:36.739> or<00:00:37.010> if<00:00:37.309> you<00:00:37.430> need<00:00:37.610> to<00:00:37.760> get<00:00:37.940> through

an area that isn't conducive to standing
up<00:00:41.060> or<00:00:41.330> might<00:00:41.570> might<00:00:42.020> present<00:00:42.560> a<00:00:42.710> danger<00:00:42.950> is<00:00:43.430> to

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
up or might might present a danger is to

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.630 
up or might might present a danger is to
get<00:00:44.030> down<00:00:44.210> on<00:00:44.450> your<00:00:44.570> knees<00:00:44.780> and<00:00:45.430> paddle<00:00:46.430> your

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
get down on your knees and paddle your

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.670 
get down on your knees and paddle your
board<00:00:46.880> like<00:00:46.970> you<00:00:47.300> would<00:00:47.510> a<00:00:47.540> canoe<00:00:47.930> bring<00:00:48.560> your

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
board like you would a canoe bring your

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.560 
board like you would a canoe bring your
hands<00:00:49.160> down<00:00:49.220> the<00:00:49.670> paddle<00:00:50.090> so<00:00:50.240> that<00:00:50.390> they're

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
hands down the paddle so that they're

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.180 
hands down the paddle so that they're
much<00:00:50.720> lower<00:00:51.050> than<00:00:51.200> they're<00:00:51.410> meant<00:00:51.440> to<00:00:51.680> be<00:00:51.800> and

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
much lower than they're meant to be and

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.090 
much lower than they're meant to be and
reach<00:00:53.060> out<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:53.720> basically<00:00:54.290> use<00:00:54.650> the<00:00:54.860> same

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
reach out and basically use the same

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.100 
reach out and basically use the same
technique<00:00:55.329> so<00:00:56.329> that<00:00:56.360> you<00:00:56.630> can<00:00:56.840> get<00:00:56.990> yourself

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
technique so that you can get yourself

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.140 
technique so that you can get yourself
out<00:00:57.560> of<00:00:57.590> danger<00:00:58.070> or<00:00:58.100> into<00:00:58.579> a<00:00:58.610> more<00:00:58.910> suitable

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
out of danger or into a more suitable

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.100 
out of danger or into a more suitable
area<00:00:59.810> where<00:01:00.260> you<00:01:00.440> can<00:01:00.620> then<00:01:00.770> stand<00:01:01.130> up<00:01:01.989> one<00:01:02.989> of

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
area where you can then stand up one of

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.319 
area where you can then stand up one of
the<00:01:03.260> biggest<00:01:03.590> dangers<00:01:03.829> to<00:01:04.369> stand<00:01:04.640> up<00:01:04.820> paddling

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:05.329 
the biggest dangers to stand up paddling

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:08.020 
the biggest dangers to stand up paddling
is<00:01:05.479> offshore<00:01:06.229> winds<00:01:06.560> meaning<00:01:07.430> winds<00:01:07.700> that<00:01:07.970> are

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
is offshore winds meaning winds that are

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.109 
is offshore winds meaning winds that are
blowing<00:01:08.119> from<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:08.840> shore<00:01:09.259> out<00:01:09.950> to<00:01:10.340> sea<00:01:10.610> or<00:01:10.880> out

into the lake or river offshore winds

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.090 
into the lake or river offshore winds
can<00:01:14.570> be<00:01:14.750> very<00:01:14.990> dangerous<00:01:15.229> to<00:01:15.500> stand<00:01:15.920> up

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
can be very dangerous to stand up
