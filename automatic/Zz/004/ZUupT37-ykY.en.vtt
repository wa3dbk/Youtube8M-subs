00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
really matter because like I said just

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.090 
really matter because like I said just
does<00:04:07.840> not<00:04:07.989> have<00:04:08.140> to<00:04:08.200> be<00:04:08.260> done<00:04:08.470> all<00:04:08.709> in<00:04:08.739> one<00:04:09.069> shot

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
does not have to be done all in one shot

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.880 
does not have to be done all in one shot
you<00:04:09.760> can<00:04:10.000> be<00:04:10.239> broken<00:04:10.510> up<00:04:10.720> by<00:04:10.989> like<00:04:11.260> brakes<00:04:11.620> and

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
you can be broken up by like brakes and

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.640 
you can be broken up by like brakes and
all<00:04:11.980> that<00:04:12.690> mostly<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:13.840> high<00:04:14.110> speed<00:04:14.470> will

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
all that mostly the high speed will

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.250 
all that mostly the high speed will
probably<00:04:14.980> get<00:04:15.100> on<00:04:15.160> this<00:04:15.489> is<00:04:15.700> about<00:04:15.989> 2,600<00:04:16.989> calm

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
probably get on this is about 2,600 calm

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.960
