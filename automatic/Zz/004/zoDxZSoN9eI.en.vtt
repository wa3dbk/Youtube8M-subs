00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.449
 gamer as it must have seen by title 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.239
 it is practically confirmed that versions 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:38.300
 for playstation 3 and black xbox 360 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.309
 ops three will come to the fore have seen is to be 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.960
 even because this was not 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.940
 confirmed until the present time 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.609
 date art video grandchild it was there that did not 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.079
 manifested on this, indeed 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:50.269
 shrek has already confirmed that she is 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.729
 working only on the 4 boxing version 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:55.879
 manny pc that is if it actually exists in 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:57.319
 versions of ps3 and x360 is another producer 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.359
 is developing the producer is 

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:01.429
 behaving as it happened in the 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.250
 iron winner was the queen studios who 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:07.310
 did the ps3 360 version and not the 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.750
 sledgehammer ok but at last it had not been 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.549
 still confirmed 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.110
 up to the present date has also not been 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.299
 shoot kenneth lewis did not come and 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.359
 will confirm you said you 're having a version 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.789
 of ps3 and 360 being developed but 

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:21.740
 through a publication of the magazine 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:24.200
 game informer one of the most reputed 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.359
 if not the most reputable game magazine of the 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.950
 The world has a list of 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:31.549
 platforms of paula safes will become 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.350
 reveal will be released and at fps 3 960 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.600
 listed as it was on this list. 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.250
 background image nor the magazine informs 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.060
 that the game will be released for the 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.909
 ps4 ps3 360 and pc 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.859
 Of course it may be a mistake, but I do not 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.570
 I believe it 's as I said it in a way. 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:49.159
 well respected and are within the 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.200
 industry has long had these 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.969
 interviews when every year they do is 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.499
 a super complete stuff about kode5 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:58.880
 ford announced at this time of year 

00:01:56.499 --> 00:02:00.770
 would hardly have such information 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.969
 wrong is this is the type of 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.649
 information that they hardly 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.179
 would miss the platform that the game 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.429
 going to be released can really happen 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.100
 but I do not think that's the case I think 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.650
 yes, we'll have a lot soon 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.050
 soon in the future a fearp ad 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.030
 from usp joÃ£o confirming 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.740
 the development of the ps3 version and 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.630
 Xbox 360 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.730
 right but as I spoke with the size 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.830
 this semi-confirmed video is not 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.000
 100% confirmed because I joined here in this 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.370
 video did not manifest themselves 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.890
 is only a very reliable source that 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.120
 passed the information to the right people on the 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.920
 However, I want to talk about this video too. 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.780
 about something else since it would be a 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.340
 video very short and resolved other global 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.830
 topic here is also about the launch 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.150
 results from this year will be on the right Friday 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.500
 I even commented on this in the 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.840
 twitter, do not even get to talking about 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.460
 video with you but the codex year goes 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.630
 launch on a Friday more precisely in the 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.400
 November 6th 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.630
 This is strange since all the 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.760
 codes and up to date have been 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.770
 released on a Tuesday at least 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.540
 I remembered almost 4 and such 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.020
 I already talked to you Tuesday one day. 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.510
 rather targeted for release 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.070
 games at least you can realize that 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.560
 almost all the blockbuster almost all 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.110
 football game and is released in a 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.640
 Tuesday is a good day in the States 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.190
 united or something like that in the beginning 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.320
 I do not know the exact reason but anyway it's the 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.900
 day that is usually released this year 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.489
 can be released on a Friday 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.250
 Is everyone wondering why? 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.510
 has a specific reason and a reason 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.250
 more obvious that it can turn the head of 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.930
 everyone is because it is once great 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.340
 The weekend is actually the beginning of 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.760
 a best season weekend for 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.950
 play and that's exactly the answer, right? 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.350
 the senior vice president of activision 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.970
 bobby kotick is talked to forbes 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.830
 recently in an interview he 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.660
 explained more about this date of 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.000
 I 'm going to read that exactly the 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.860
 which he spoke after a halter for 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.959
 up but really is basically what the 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.940
 People already imagined open quotation marks. 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.920
 we thought it would be quite fun 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.450
 for fans to start the weekend at 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.310
 black ops series is more player of 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.410
 history of cold cable and with almost 100 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.180
 millions of players so far with 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.920
 black ops 31 out matriarch is 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.430
 really taking things to a new 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.410
 level 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.880
 there is much to do in this game between 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.890
 all available modes 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.420
 the campaign has been repaginated and now 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.989
 be played cooperatively with their 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.090
 friends 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.410
 the men of course are back and 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.600
 multiplayer is doing an experiment 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.000
 with tons of new and deep 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.470
 ideas then give fans the maximum 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.060
 possible time for it to them 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.240
 experience everything the game has 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.669
 to offer makes a lot of sense as 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.710
 a company we have already launched different 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.250
 dates in the past really depends on the 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.470
 game 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.750
 what works best for him again 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.340
 for the scoreboard at 31st launch on Friday 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.580
 it was only to those that it is something we think 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.500
 which fans would enjoy sealing quotes 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.540
 then as you can see from the speech 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.120
 the senior vice president of the 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.400
 actvision is really meant to give 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.260
 Larger time for the whole galera is all 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.110
 world when a code released that is to turn 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.060
 the early morning playing make prestige play 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.560
 the shoulders then this year is going to be crazy 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.450
 the sound will have people playing the men 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.550
 This year is going to be a joke and until 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.780
 kopf campaign this code will be without 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.040
 doubt that on the date of 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.480
 We're going to have more things to launch. 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.230
 to explore multiple bring many 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.540
 news 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.910
 men are not even talking and the campaign 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.919
 It's going to be cop anyway, there's not much. 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.300
 for us to explore this code and always 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.919
 when the game is released to explore everything 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.990
 once and for all, then game to be released 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.770
 It is really going to help quite 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.330
 people will get there 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.400
 friday saturday sunday to explore 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.230
 quite the game, right? 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.060
 without worrying about school work 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.800
 the next day despite people who 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.560
 study and work on Saturday but finally 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.970
 I do not think so. 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.980
 a really good idea they 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.830
 decided to launch this year's 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.240
 friday so that's it I could pass 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.700
 This day is here for you. 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.110
 below you think about everything and 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.510
 Let's hope that the 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.650
 versions of ps3 and 360 to be confirmed 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.860
 I know there are a lot of people 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:47.020
 here in Brazil who did not buy a pec4 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.150
 do not have a pc gamer so could never 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.790
 play the game so I think it's still 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.919
 It's acceptable for us to have another 363 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.660
 But it's about time we started to 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.460
 who has not started the new consoles 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.780
 to think because I believe that year 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.660
 comes the age cut is going to be 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.820
 completely from the new generation of the current 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.110
 right generation I'm going to stay here if 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.250
 you like to serve us want to leave 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.050
 your limit and if possible your 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:13.560
 favorite and that's it then a hug to 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:13.560
 everybody gets god and it's even souls
