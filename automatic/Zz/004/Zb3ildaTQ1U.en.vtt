00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:17.439
 I know you like to fish I know you have to look for it as 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:23.619
 age drowned for home 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.079
 clear here we have come to by league the whole set the people to the comfortable 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.689
 I can taste a little bit all the stuff 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.689
 what is the difference between inside the disk and the ride 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.350
 well we ask that the disc is a character much longer are every time 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.680
 more narrow 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.840
 and it's a traditional sea kayak kayak 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.190
 the project to raise Incae that cuts the waves very well 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.050
 how much texas more or less 75 of a perfect 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.840
 is an ideal kayak until more or less people about 80 kilos is a kayak that and 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.280
 in it or same as the ride is to say 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.280
 the cane workers have 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.650
 paradores 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.530
 the plugs for winter 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.060
 and we add one more interesting thing 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.700
 fight wound 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.790
 security element in case you ever fall into the water you can catch 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.400
 and the compartment team 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.950
 it's a compartment that gives us a much bigger space 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.720
 the disc is a kayak designed to be a fast kayak 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.290
 for when from the saw when you see the birds that are there marking that 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.290
 there is fish to be able to leave fast will go towards them 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.770
 and at helmet level 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.200
 look at this type of punishment 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.640
 round 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.580
 betancourt studied to maintain direction 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.290
 but be round 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.290
 tips a little lift sun fall 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.980
 have a good tailor 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.540
 look how light I think it's nothing 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.040
 there is an important thing that has told us all the kayaks broken mont are auto 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.450
 to speak for which unsinkable are if fools 

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:15.480
 never attended to them this time like this 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.330
