for the foot for the 14,000 and then we

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.100

terms of cost we think with the

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.339

the sales teams the advice centre and
the<00:04:54.180> information<00:04:54.479> we've<00:04:54.720> sent<00:04:54.960> out<00:04:55.080> to

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
the information we've sent out to

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:56.659 
the information we've sent out to
customers<00:04:55.409> it's<00:04:55.860> probably<00:04:56.129> cost<00:04:56.340> us<00:04:56.490> in

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
customers it's probably cost us in

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.969 
customers it's probably cost us in
excess<00:04:56.970> of<00:04:57.180> half<00:04:57.300> a<00:04:57.449> million<00:04:57.720> pounds<00:04:57.979> it's

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
excess of half a million pounds it's

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.100 
excess of half a million pounds it's
worth<00:04:59.250> it<00:04:59.460> in<00:04:59.550> the<00:04:59.580> end<00:04:59.699> I<00:05:00.120> think<00:05:00.750> it<00:05:00.840> has<00:05:00.930> to<00:05:01.080> be

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
worth it in the end I think it has to be

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.510 
worth it in the end I think it has to be
worth<00:05:01.289> anything<00:05:01.650> that<00:05:01.889> makes<00:05:02.009> eating<00:05:02.370> out

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
worth anything that makes eating out

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.339 
worth anything that makes eating out
easier<00:05:03.120> which<00:05:03.599> is<00:05:03.750> what<00:05:03.870> our<00:05:03.900> customers

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
easier which is what our customers

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:06.439 
easier which is what our customers
therefore<00:05:05.310> makes<00:05:05.610> it<00:05:05.759> good<00:05:05.880> for<00:05:06.060> us<00:05:06.180> and<00:05:06.389> good

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449
