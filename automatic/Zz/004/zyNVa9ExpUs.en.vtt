00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.359 
glowing stuff this is more of a subtle
weapon<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.619> doesn't<00:01:28.920> look<00:01:29.009> as<00:01:29.130> flashy

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
weapon and it doesn't look as flashy

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.920 
weapon and it doesn't look as flashy
it's<00:01:29.579> on<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.729> other<00:01:29.880> exotic<00:01:30.180> gear<00:01:30.570> but

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
it's on the other exotic gear but

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.480 
it's on the other exotic gear but
nevertheless<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.560> makes<00:01:31.829> up<00:01:32.040> for<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.250> in

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
nevertheless it makes up for that in

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.679 
nevertheless it makes up for that in
actual<00:01:32.880> performance<00:01:33.390> because<00:01:33.540> it's

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
actual performance because it's

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.390 
actual performance because it's
definitely<00:01:34.200> definitely<00:01:34.500> an<00:01:34.770> amazing<00:01:35.250> weapon

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
definitely definitely an amazing weapon

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.859 
definitely definitely an amazing weapon
I<00:01:35.729> think<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.119> only<00:01:36.210> way<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:36.479> weapon<00:01:36.750> could

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
I think the only way this weapon could

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.270 
I think the only way this weapon could
be<00:01:36.930> better<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.500> if<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.710> had<00:01:37.829> an<00:01:37.920> element<00:01:38.250> of

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
be better is if I had an element of

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.190 
be better is if I had an element of
damage<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.909> had<00:01:39.150> like<00:01:39.299> void<00:01:39.570> or<00:01:39.750> arc<00:01:39.960> or

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
damage so that had like void or arc or

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.840 
damage so that had like void or arc or
solar<00:01:40.439> damage<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.040> I'll<00:01:41.430> be<00:01:41.549> really<00:01:41.640> helpful

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
solar damage and I'll be really helpful

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.609 
solar damage and I'll be really helpful
for<00:01:42.060> strikes<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.659> PvE<00:01:42.960> stuff<00:01:43.350> but<00:01:43.530> honestly

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
for strikes and PvE stuff but honestly

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.170 
for strikes and PvE stuff but honestly
this<00:01:44.250> weapon<00:01:44.579> apart<00:01:44.790> from<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.030> is

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
this weapon apart from that is

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.969 
this weapon apart from that is
absolutely<00:01:45.659> perfect<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:46.140> can<00:01:46.290> be<00:01:46.439> any<00:01:46.680> better

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
absolutely perfect it can be any better

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.069 
absolutely perfect it can be any better
in<00:01:47.280> my<00:01:47.460> opinion<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.420> actually<00:01:48.659> really

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
in my opinion and I actually really

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.510 
in my opinion and I actually really
liked<00:01:49.259> scout<00:01:49.530> rifles<00:01:49.920> they're<00:01:50.130> probably<00:01:50.310> one

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
liked scout rifles they're probably one

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.789 
liked scout rifles they're probably one
of<00:01:50.549> my<00:01:50.700> most<00:01:50.909> used<00:01:51.060> weapons<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.869> especially

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
of my most used weapons and especially

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.260 
of my most used weapons and especially
for<00:01:52.950> non<00:01:53.070> crucible<00:01:53.460> stuff<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.729> think<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.030> find

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
for non crucible stuff I think I find

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.359 
for non crucible stuff I think I find
their<00:01:54.450> at<00:01:54.720> way<00:01:55.079> more<00:01:55.320> efficient<00:01:55.770> for<00:01:55.890> damaging

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
their at way more efficient for damaging

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.069 
their at way more efficient for damaging
long-range<00:01:56.820> enemies<00:01:57.240> than<00:01:57.450> auto<00:01:57.659> rifles

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
long-range enemies than auto rifles

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.569 
long-range enemies than auto rifles

game pair out here this is my first time
ever<00:02:03.060> using<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.719> in<00:02:03.869> any<00:02:04.439> game<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.920> destiny<00:02:05.100> and

ever using it in any game of destiny and

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.679 
ever using it in any game of destiny and
it<00:02:05.549> was<00:02:05.640> actually<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:05.969> crucible<00:02:06.390> and

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
it was actually in the crucible and

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.690 
it was actually in the crucible and
actually<00:02:07.500> destroyed<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.160> enemies<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.580> just

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
actually destroyed the enemies I just

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.400 
actually destroyed the enemies I just
completely<00:02:09.149> ruin<00:02:09.840> them<00:02:09.989> this<00:02:10.140> is<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.259> game

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
completely ruin them this is a game

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.830 
completely ruin them this is a game
control<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.879> wasn't<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.180> iron<00:02:12.420> banner<00:02:12.569> so

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
control and it wasn't the iron banner so

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.820 
control and it wasn't the iron banner so
it<00:02:12.870> might<00:02:13.020> be<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.230> little<00:02:13.379> bit<00:02:13.590> strong

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
it might be a little bit strong

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.800 
it might be a little bit strong
or<00:02:13.890> gets<00:02:14.100> low-level<00:02:14.610> enemies<00:02:15.000> but<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.600> was

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
or gets low-level enemies but it was

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.230 
or gets low-level enemies but it was
absolutely<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.590> beastly<00:02:17.040> weapon<00:02:17.550> to<00:02:17.730> use<00:02:17.940> and

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
absolutely a beastly weapon to use and

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.210 
absolutely a beastly weapon to use and
I'll<00:02:18.480> go<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.810> good<00:02:18.930> points<00:02:19.290> in<00:02:19.410> this<00:02:19.800> weapon

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
I'll go the good points in this weapon

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.530 
I'll go the good points in this weapon
and<00:02:20.400> there<00:02:20.850> you<00:02:20.910> can<00:02:21.030> see<00:02:21.150> right<00:02:21.330> here<00:02:21.420> the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
and there you can see right here the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.420 
and there you can see right here the
reload<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:22.170> pretty<00:02:22.500> much<00:02:22.620> maxed<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.160> actual

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
reload is pretty much maxed the actual

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.640 
reload is pretty much maxed the actual
bar<00:02:23.610> it's<00:02:23.850> got<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.050> ridiculously<00:02:25.050> fast<00:02:25.260> reload

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
bar it's got a ridiculously fast reload

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.130 
bar it's got a ridiculously fast reload
reload<00:02:25.920> so<00:02:26.340> quickly<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.970> think<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.690> also<00:02:27.840> gives

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
reload so quickly I think it also gives

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.870 
reload so quickly I think it also gives
your<00:02:28.260> character<00:02:28.650> extra<00:02:29.040> ability<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:29.700> can

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
your character extra ability you can

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.640 
your character extra ability you can
seem<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.120> move<00:02:30.330> really<00:02:30.600> quickly<00:02:30.960> with<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.380> and

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
seem to move really quickly with it and

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.950 
seem to move really quickly with it and
Plus<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.100> you<00:02:32.160> can<00:02:32.280> also<00:02:32.490> upgrade<00:02:32.910> it<00:02:33.360> for<00:02:33.390> +2

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
Plus that you can also upgrade it for +2

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.530 
Plus that you can also upgrade it for +2
agility<00:02:34.380> even<00:02:34.740> further<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.370> next<00:02:36.270> perk

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
agility even further and the next perk

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.570 
agility even further and the next perk
also<00:02:37.110> boosts<00:02:37.530> movement<00:02:37.980> speed<00:02:38.190> so<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.460> can

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
also boosts movement speed so you can

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.370 
also boosts movement speed so you can
move<00:02:38.880> very<00:02:38.910> very<00:02:39.300> quickly<00:02:39.510> with<00:02:40.020> this<00:02:40.170> weapon

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
move very very quickly with this weapon

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.950 
move very very quickly with this weapon
as<00:02:40.650> default<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.130> upgrading<00:02:41.880> it<00:02:42.030> it's<00:02:42.720> really

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
as default and upgrading it it's really

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.480 
as default and upgrading it it's really
low<00:02:43.140> on<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.410> screen<00:02:43.710> which<00:02:43.890> I<00:02:43.980> like<00:02:44.160> it's<00:02:44.340> nice

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
low on the screen which I like it's nice

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.920 
low on the screen which I like it's nice
it<00:02:44.610> doesn't<00:02:44.790> take<00:02:44.880> up<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.060> lot<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.420> screen

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
it doesn't take up a lot of the screen

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.450 
it doesn't take up a lot of the screen
when<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.170> kinda<00:02:46.380> like<00:02:46.470> holding<00:02:46.830> it<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.100> the

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
when you kinda like holding it and the

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.700 
when you kinda like holding it and the
aim-down-sight<00:02:48.120> speed<00:02:48.450> is<00:02:48.690> really<00:02:49.170> really

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
aim-down-sight speed is really really

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.320 
aim-down-sight speed is really really

precision<00:04:24.400> area<00:04:24.790> so<00:04:24.880> like<00:04:25.000> a<00:04:25.030> vex<00:04:25.360> belly<00:04:25.660> or<00:04:25.930> a

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
precision area so like a vex belly or a

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.290 
precision area so like a vex belly or a
most<00:04:26.680> enemy's<00:04:27.070> heads<00:04:27.370> if<00:04:27.520> you<00:04:27.610> aim<00:04:27.790> the<00:04:27.970> actual

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
most enemy's heads if you aim the actual

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.660 
most enemy's heads if you aim the actual
reticle<00:04:28.690> on<00:04:28.870> that<00:04:29.410> precision<00:04:29.770> spot<00:04:30.160> a<00:04:30.280> tiny

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
reticle on that precision spot a tiny

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.980 
reticle on that precision spot a tiny
little<00:04:30.790> red<00:04:31.060> dot<00:04:31.300> will<00:04:31.420> appear<00:04:31.690> above<00:04:31.810> the

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
little red dot will appear above the

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.540 
little red dot will appear above the
reticle<00:04:32.410> and<00:04:32.710> that's<00:04:33.070> really<00:04:33.310> cool<00:04:33.460> because

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
reticle and that's really cool because

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:34.800 
reticle and that's really cool because
it<00:04:33.670> lets<00:04:33.820> you<00:04:33.910> know<00:04:33.940> if<00:04:34.120> you're<00:04:34.270> looking<00:04:34.660> at

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
it lets you know if you're looking at

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.360 
it lets you know if you're looking at
enemy's<00:04:35.110> weak<00:04:35.260> spot<00:04:35.530> before<00:04:35.920> you<00:04:36.160> actually

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
enemy's weak spot before you actually

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.100 
enemy's weak spot before you actually
shoot<00:04:36.730> so<00:04:36.880> you<00:04:36.940> have<00:04:37.060> to<00:04:37.150> shoot<00:04:37.360> the<00:04:37.480> enemy<00:04:37.720> to

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
shoot so you have to shoot the enemy to

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.510 
shoot so you have to shoot the enemy to
look<00:04:38.290> for<00:04:38.440> the<00:04:38.500> yellow<00:04:38.770> numbers<00:04:39.160> and<00:04:39.340> see<00:04:39.460> if

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
look for the yellow numbers and see if

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.770 
look for the yellow numbers and see if
you're<00:04:39.640> actually<00:04:39.730> doing<00:04:40.000> precision<00:04:40.480> damage

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
you're actually doing precision damage

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.150 
you're actually doing precision damage
you<00:04:40.960> can<00:04:41.110> just<00:04:41.260> look<00:04:41.440> it<00:04:41.620> and<00:04:41.920> you<00:04:42.010> see<00:04:42.130> the

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
you can just look it and you see the

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.470 
you can just look it and you see the
tiny<00:04:42.430> red<00:04:42.610> dot<00:04:42.790> it's<00:04:42.850> kind<00:04:43.030> of<00:04:43.060> a<00:04:43.120> cool<00:04:43.330> little

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
tiny red dot it's kind of a cool little

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.360 
tiny red dot it's kind of a cool little
indicator<00:04:44.020> that's<00:04:44.530> very<00:04:44.770> subtle<00:04:45.100> that<00:04:45.220> lets

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
indicator that's very subtle that lets

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.890 
indicator that's very subtle that lets
you<00:04:45.460> know<00:04:45.520> you're<00:04:45.700> about<00:04:45.910> to<00:04:46.120> get<00:04:46.300> precision

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
you know you're about to get precision

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.380 
you know you're about to get precision
damage<00:04:47.350> if<00:04:47.500> you<00:04:47.680> do<00:04:47.920> shoot<00:04:48.250> and<00:04:48.490> then<00:04:49.060> finally

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
damage if you do shoot and then finally

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.850 
damage if you do shoot and then finally
there's<00:04:49.570> also<00:04:49.750> another<00:04:50.050> rumor<00:04:50.500> about<00:04:50.590> this

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
there's also another rumor about this

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.350 
there's also another rumor about this
weapon<00:04:51.220> which<00:04:51.370> I<00:04:51.520> haven't<00:04:51.700> actually<00:04:52.180> been

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
weapon which I haven't actually been

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.970 
weapon which I haven't actually been
able<00:04:52.480> to<00:04:52.690> confirm<00:04:53.110> a<00:04:53.290> people<00:04:53.590> saying<00:04:53.830> that

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
able to confirm a people saying that

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.530 
able to confirm a people saying that
you're<00:04:54.130> able<00:04:54.250> to<00:04:54.490> find<00:04:54.730> chests<00:04:55.060> with<00:04:55.240> it<00:04:55.360> like

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
you're able to find chests with it like

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.510 
you're able to find chests with it like
if<00:04:55.720> it<00:04:55.900> lets<00:04:56.560> off<00:04:56.710> some<00:04:56.890> kind<00:04:56.980> of<00:04:57.100> beep<00:04:57.310> if

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
if it lets off some kind of beep if

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.620 
if it lets off some kind of beep if
you're<00:04:57.640> near<00:04:57.850> a<00:04:57.880> chest<00:04:58.210> or<00:04:58.270> if<00:04:58.360> you're<00:04:58.480> looking

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
you're near a chest or if you're looking

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.910 
you're near a chest or if you're looking
at<00:04:58.900> it<00:04:58.990> I'm<00:04:59.080> not<00:04:59.170> sure<00:04:59.230> how<00:04:59.410> that<00:04:59.530> works<00:04:59.770> and

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
at it I'm not sure how that works and

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.800 
at it I'm not sure how that works and
I've<00:05:00.550> tried<00:05:00.790> it<00:05:00.940> myself<00:05:01.030> haven't<00:05:01.480> seemed<00:05:01.720> to

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
I've tried it myself haven't seemed to

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.300 
I've tried it myself haven't seemed to
find<00:05:01.990> anything<00:05:02.380> like<00:05:02.560> that<00:05:02.590> but<00:05:03.010> people<00:05:03.100> are

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
find anything like that but people are

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.010 
find anything like that but people are
saying<00:05:03.460> apparently<00:05:03.940> you<00:05:04.000> can<00:05:04.090> find<00:05:04.330> chest<00:05:04.600> or

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
saying apparently you can find chest or

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.780 
saying apparently you can find chest or
something<00:05:05.200> that<00:05:05.500> and<00:05:05.620> there's<00:05:05.740> also<00:05:05.860> a<00:05:06.280> little

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
something that and there's also a little

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.580 
something that and there's also a little
compass<00:05:07.300> on<00:05:07.510> the<00:05:07.600> weapon<00:05:07.960> that<00:05:07.990> I'm<00:05:08.260> not<00:05:08.440> sure

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
compass on the weapon that I'm not sure

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:09.840 
compass on the weapon that I'm not sure
always<00:05:08.800> points<00:05:09.130> to<00:05:09.190> I<00:05:09.220> think<00:05:09.340> it<00:05:09.550> might<00:05:09.700> just

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
always points to I think it might just

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.370 
always points to I think it might just
point<00:05:10.090> to<00:05:10.180> north<00:05:10.450> or<00:05:10.570> something<00:05:10.960> anything

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
point to north or something anything

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.750 
point to north or something anything
actually<00:05:11.740> points<00:05:11.980> to<00:05:12.040> anything<00:05:12.310> or<00:05:12.430> enemies

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
actually points to anything or enemies

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:13.980 
actually points to anything or enemies
or<00:05:12.880> anything<00:05:13.030> about<00:05:13.300> it<00:05:13.419> just<00:05:13.450> seems<00:05:13.780> to<00:05:13.900> point

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
or anything about it just seems to point

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.720 
or anything about it just seems to point
the<00:05:14.140> same<00:05:14.320> direction<00:05:14.500> all<00:05:14.710> the<00:05:14.740> time<00:05:14.830> but<00:05:15.550> it

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
the same direction all the time but it

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:16.800 
the same direction all the time but it
may<00:05:15.910> be<00:05:15.970> there's<00:05:16.150> a<00:05:16.180> cool<00:05:16.330> it<00:05:16.450> Easter<00:05:16.720> Egg

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
may be there's a cool it Easter Egg

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.780 
may be there's a cool it Easter Egg
behind<00:05:17.050> it<00:05:17.200> who<00:05:17.290> knows<00:05:17.530> and<00:05:17.710> but<00:05:18.460> now<00:05:18.550> let's<00:05:18.669> go

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
behind it who knows and but now let's go

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.370 
behind it who knows and but now let's go
through<00:05:19.000> the<00:05:19.120> upgrade<00:05:19.270> tree<00:05:19.870> you<00:05:20.080> can<00:05:20.230> see

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
through the upgrade tree you can see

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.600 
through the upgrade tree you can see
them<00:05:20.530> all<00:05:20.620> right<00:05:20.650> here<00:05:20.980> the<00:05:21.070> most<00:05:21.250> notable

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
them all right here the most notable

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.430 
them all right here the most notable
ones<00:05:21.820> are<00:05:21.970> the<00:05:22.390> third<00:05:22.630> eye<00:05:22.780> perk<00:05:23.020> which<00:05:23.260> is<00:05:23.350> an

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
ones are the third eye perk which is an

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.870 
ones are the third eye perk which is an
amazing<00:05:24.010> pet<00:05:24.190> to<00:05:24.310> have<00:05:24.340> you<00:05:24.550> can<00:05:24.669> see<00:05:24.790> the

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
amazing pet to have you can see the

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.950 
amazing pet to have you can see the
mini-map<00:05:25.150> in<00:05:25.300> your<00:05:25.390> aim<00:05:25.510> in<00:05:25.630> our<00:05:25.720> sight

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
mini-map in your aim in our sight

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.750 
mini-map in your aim in our sight
definitely<00:05:26.710> very<00:05:26.919> very<00:05:27.100> good<00:05:27.250> for<00:05:27.430> scout

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
definitely very very good for scout

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.280 
definitely very very good for scout
rifles<00:05:28.270> often<00:05:28.630> you<00:05:28.720> spend<00:05:28.930> a<00:05:28.960> lot<00:05:29.050> of<00:05:29.110> time

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
rifles often you spend a lot of time

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.750 
rifles often you spend a lot of time
more<00:05:29.500> like<00:05:29.560> snipers<00:05:30.130> kind<00:05:30.310> of<00:05:30.370> aiming<00:05:30.520> down

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
more like snipers kind of aiming down

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.430 
more like snipers kind of aiming down
sights<00:05:31.030> enemies<00:05:31.390> picking<00:05:31.690> them<00:05:31.810> off<00:05:31.900> and<00:05:32.140> it's

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
sights enemies picking them off and it's

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.600 
sights enemies picking them off and it's

I'm<00:06:06.070> not<00:06:06.190> sure<00:06:06.640> what<00:06:06.910> that<00:06:06.940> means<00:06:07.330> I'll<00:06:07.539> let

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
I'm not sure what that means I'll let

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:08.470

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:09.980 
that point but I'm assuming that means

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.230 
that point but I'm assuming that means
you<00:06:10.100> can<00:06:10.220> fire<00:06:10.400> it<00:06:10.430> as<00:06:10.640> fast<00:06:10.850> as<00:06:11.030> you<00:06:11.120> can

actually press the trigger which could

be absolutely insane because go really

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.330 
be absolutely insane because go really
fast<00:06:14.660> fire<00:06:14.960> rate<00:06:14.990> as<00:06:15.320> it<00:06:15.560> stands<00:06:15.860> but<00:06:16.070> I<00:06:16.130> can't
