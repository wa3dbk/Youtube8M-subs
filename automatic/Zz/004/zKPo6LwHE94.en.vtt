00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.760
 the staff is resolved to make a video 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.589
 quickly to show the feature of the 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:18.439
 multishow going running 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:21.270
 Okay, those who do not know how beautiful it is 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.250
 this ability to perform two 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.160
 applications simultaneously 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.199
 then I'll be here a frog is from the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.529
 haiti that already has this feature applied 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.000
 to activate the shortcut here I'll hold the 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.400
 back button 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.070
 it shows here a list of applications 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:43.049
 that I can call is 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:48.269
 busy at the same time for example I 

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:50.729
 I'll call you here the maps ok I'll call 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:53.280
 that your map drags here to the screen 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:57.869
 He's going to take care of the whole thing here, okay? 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:03.049
 Where am I and now I'm going to move here? 

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:03.049
 I'll call you, for example. 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.090
 call for example youtube 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.090
 I hold it here in the application 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:22.409
 come on being in an app 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:24.630
 appears here safe application and places 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.469
 here in the position at the top of 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.770
 low 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:31.619
 It's going to load okay so here it now has 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.619
 simultaneously open two applications 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.539
 I see here it shows that a little bar 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.060
 that I can decrease the size 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.189
 available for each application can I 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.429
 let him down in the corner 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.009
 or can I leave him here more on top 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:50.490
 I can not control here the portion of 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.590
 screen that is given to each application has 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.450
 some shortcuts that appear here I 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.479
 I can change place applications 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.920
 realize or I can get the 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.119
 choose an application to go back to 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.819
 fill the screen full 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.369
 then this shortcut here makes it 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:06.869
 again full screen 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:11.520
 so it was very simple to be 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:14.840
 used so that I 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.850
 This is the thesis here. 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.080
 showing me what to hide it, I'm enough 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.050
 to hold 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.240
 then back for some 51 seconds 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.670
 be gone 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.360
 here in italy so i hold again 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.880
 he goes back to rock 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.920
 then this is the feature and windows that already 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:42.030
 is available in these new 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:45.440
 leaks there modified ones of ps3 a 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.440
 hug until the next
