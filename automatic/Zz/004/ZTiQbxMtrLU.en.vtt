00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:21.939 
it it's really it's really a pretty

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:24.839 
it it's really it's really a pretty
almost<00:00:22.449> cerulean<00:00:23.380> blue<00:00:23.650> then<00:00:24.310> down<00:00:24.579> here<00:00:24.820> I

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:24.849 
almost cerulean blue then down here I

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:26.730 
almost cerulean blue then down here I
can<00:00:25.060> see<00:00:25.269> the<00:00:25.300> yellow<00:00:25.599> reflected<00:00:26.349> light<00:00:26.529> off

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
can see the yellow reflected light off

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.620 
can see the yellow reflected light off
of<00:00:26.949> his<00:00:27.130> shirt<00:00:27.369> but<00:00:27.759> the<00:00:27.789> first<00:00:28.089> important

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
of his shirt but the first important

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.450 
of his shirt but the first important
thing<00:00:28.659> to<00:00:28.960> do<00:00:29.079> is<00:00:29.380> to<00:00:29.619> get<00:00:29.739> this<00:00:29.949> forty<00:00:30.310> percent

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
thing to do is to get this forty percent

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.090 
thing to do is to get this forty percent
value<00:00:30.880> difference<00:00:31.449> between<00:00:31.900> the<00:00:32.439> sunlit<00:00:32.920> and

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
value difference between the sunlit and

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.330 
value difference between the sunlit and
the<00:00:33.220> shadow<00:00:33.489> side<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:35.170> since<00:00:35.500> the<00:00:35.739> shadow<00:00:36.010> side

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
the shadow side so since the shadow side

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.459 
the shadow side so since the shadow side
of<00:00:36.370> any<00:00:36.670> object<00:00:37.120> is<00:00:37.270> the<00:00:37.480> same<00:00:37.690> color<00:00:38.020> as<00:00:38.109> the

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.469 
of any object is the same color as the

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:41.189 
of any object is the same color as the
object<00:00:38.920> upon<00:00:39.309> which<00:00:39.340> it<00:00:39.640> is<00:00:39.760> cast<00:00:40.090> I<00:00:40.480> have<00:00:41.050> to

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
object upon which it is cast I have to

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.279 
object upon which it is cast I have to
make<00:00:41.379> a<00:00:41.590> darker<00:00:42.250> orange<00:00:43.210> to<00:00:43.629> do<00:00:43.809> this<00:00:43.989> shadow

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:44.289 
make a darker orange to do this shadow

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:47.669 
make a darker orange to do this shadow
side<00:00:45.000> after<00:00:46.000> the<00:00:46.030> skin<00:00:46.390> color<00:00:46.660> has<00:00:46.960> dried<00:00:47.320> I'm

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:47.679 
side after the skin color has dried I'm

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:50.520 
side after the skin color has dried I'm
checking<00:00:48.340> to<00:00:48.489> see<00:00:48.789> what<00:00:49.210> value<00:00:49.780> it<00:00:50.019> is<00:00:50.050> on<00:00:50.379> my

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
checking to see what value it is on my

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.529 
checking to see what value it is on my
little<00:00:50.739> value<00:00:51.100> scale<00:00:51.399> here<00:00:51.609> and<00:00:51.760> it<00:00:52.239> looks<00:00:52.420> to

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 
little value scale here and it looks to

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:55.229 
little value scale here and it looks to
me<00:00:52.629> like<00:00:52.660> it's<00:00:52.989> very<00:00:53.320> close<00:00:53.620> to<00:00:53.800> value<00:00:54.190> too<00:00:54.460> so

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
me like it's very close to value too so

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.060 
me like it's very close to value too so
that<00:00:55.449> means<00:00:55.690> I<00:00:55.899> have<00:00:56.109> to<00:00:56.260> leave<00:00:56.410> three<00:00:56.769> values

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
that means I have to leave three values

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.700 
that means I have to leave three values
in<00:00:57.399> the<00:00:57.489> middle<00:00:57.789> and<00:00:57.969> my<00:00:58.870> value<00:00:59.350> for<00:00:59.379> the

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
in the middle and my value for the

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.319 
in the middle and my value for the
shadow<00:00:59.920> side<00:01:00.219> has<00:01:00.460> to<00:01:00.579> be<00:01:00.699> clear<00:01:00.940> down<00:01:01.089> here<00:01:01.120> at

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
shadow side has to be clear down here at

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.619 
shadow side has to be clear down here at
value<00:01:01.660> 6<00:01:01.989> and<00:01:02.789> because<00:01:03.789> I<00:01:03.820> don't<00:01:04.089> want<00:01:04.269> to<00:01:04.390> try

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
value 6 and because I don't want to try

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.200 
value 6 and because I don't want to try
it<00:01:04.660> out<00:01:04.870> here<00:01:05.140> on<00:01:05.260> my<00:01:05.410> painting<00:01:06.070> I'm<00:01:06.640> going<00:01:07.060> to

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
and I'm gonna try this for value here

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.709 
and I'm gonna try this for value here
I've<00:01:33.280> just<00:01:33.490> painted<00:01:33.850> it<00:01:33.939> on<00:01:34.119> the<00:01:34.240> side<00:01:34.450> of<00:01:34.479> my

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:34.719

I've just painted it on the side of my
board<00:01:35.439> here<00:01:35.710> it's<00:01:36.250> awfully<00:01:36.610> hard<00:01:36.820> to<00:01:37.000> tell<00:01:37.240> the

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
board here it's awfully hard to tell the

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.109 
board here it's awfully hard to tell the
value<00:01:38.320> when<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.619> paint<00:01:38.860> is<00:01:38.979> still<00:01:39.009> wet<00:01:39.250> but

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
value when the paint is still wet but

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:41.789 
value when the paint is still wet but
I'm<00:01:40.390> going<00:01:40.600> to<00:01:40.630> put<00:01:40.810> it<00:01:40.930> here<00:01:40.960> next<00:01:41.229> to<00:01:41.439> the<00:01:41.530> 5

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
I'm going to put it here next to the 5

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.010 
I'm going to put it here next to the 5
and<00:01:42.130> see<00:01:42.340> if<00:01:42.430> it<00:01:42.520> looks<00:01:42.670> darker<00:01:43.270> to<00:01:43.719> me<00:01:43.869> it

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
and see if it looks darker to me it

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.590 
and see if it looks darker to me it
looks<00:01:44.200> slightly<00:01:44.469> darker<00:01:45.130> I'm<00:01:45.610> squinting<00:01:46.360> my

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
looks slightly darker I'm squinting my

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.600 
looks slightly darker I'm squinting my
eyes<00:01:46.780> because<00:01:47.320> by<00:01:47.560> squinting<00:01:47.950> your<00:01:48.070> eyes<00:01:48.130> you

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
eyes because by squinting your eyes you

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.850 
eyes because by squinting your eyes you
can<00:01:48.759> get<00:01:48.939> the<00:01:49.509> much<00:01:49.780> of<00:01:49.899> the<00:01:49.990> light<00:01:50.170> out<00:01:50.439> of<00:01:50.469> out

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
can get the much of the light out of out

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.010 
can get the much of the light out of out

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
relationship a little better just to be

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.490 
slightly and to gray the color I'm going
to<00:01:59.649> touch<00:01:59.920> just<00:02:00.820> a<00:02:01.000> tiny<00:02:01.329> bit<00:02:01.780> of<00:02:02.020> green<00:02:02.289> I'm

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
to touch just a tiny bit of green I'm

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.010 
to touch just a tiny bit of green I'm
just<00:02:02.710> graying<00:02:03.130> it<00:02:03.310> slightly<00:02:06.240> okay<00:02:07.240> I'm<00:02:07.299> very

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
just graying it slightly okay I'm very

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.450 
just graying it slightly okay I'm very
sure<00:02:08.229> it<00:02:08.320> looks<00:02:08.500> darker<00:02:08.860> here<00:02:09.070> so<00:02:09.190> I'm<00:02:09.310> going

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
sure it looks darker here so I'm going

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.610 
sure it looks darker here so I'm going
to<00:02:09.550> use<00:02:09.670> that<00:02:09.910> would<00:02:10.090> be<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.390> color<00:02:10.600> for<00:02:11.500> it

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
to use that would be the color for it

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.550 
to use that would be the color for it
down<00:02:12.129> here<00:02:12.430> and<00:02:12.640> then<00:02:12.760> I'm<00:02:12.849> going<00:02:13.030> to<00:02:13.090> add

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
down here and then I'm going to add

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.180 
down here and then I'm going to add
possibly<00:02:14.560> a<00:02:14.590> little<00:02:14.920> more

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
possibly a little more

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.399 
possibly a little more
permanent<00:02:16.879> rose<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.209> it<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.780> cool<00:02:18.019> the<00:02:18.200> color

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
permanent rose to it to cool the color

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.240 

okay<00:04:20.230> I'm<00:04:20.470> gonna<00:04:20.560> check<00:04:20.860> for<00:04:21.130> value<00:04:23.250> it's

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
okay I'm gonna check for value it's

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.610 
okay I'm gonna check for value it's
slightly<00:04:24.520> darker<00:04:25.060> than<00:04:26.020> value<00:04:26.350> five<00:04:26.740> here<00:04:27.100> so

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
slightly darker than value five here so

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.190
