00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
okay I'm switching to Les Paul which is

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:04.039 
okay I'm switching to Les Paul which is
a<00:00:03.179> whole<00:00:03.330> different<00:00:03.360> beast<00:00:03.689> with<00:00:03.959> the

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
a whole different beast with the

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.990 
a whole different beast with the
humbuckers<00:00:04.589> on<00:00:04.890> it<00:00:05.040> it's<00:00:05.520> a<00:00:05.609> bigger<00:00:05.790> thicker

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
humbuckers on it it's a bigger thicker

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.030 
humbuckers on it it's a bigger thicker
sound<00:00:06.359> so<00:00:06.629> oftentimes<00:00:07.020> what<00:00:07.350> I'll<00:00:07.470> do<00:00:07.620> is<00:00:07.799> back

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
sound so oftentimes what I'll do is back

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.620 
sound so oftentimes what I'll do is back
off<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.460> gain<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:08.700> little<00:00:09.090> bit<00:00:09.179> on<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.330> pedals

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
off to gain a little bit on the pedals

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.540 
off to gain a little bit on the pedals
but<00:00:10.139> still<00:00:10.410> they<00:00:10.740> both<00:00:10.889> function<00:00:11.160> really

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
but still they both function really

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:28.970 
but still they both function really
really<00:00:12.210> great<00:00:12.389> with<00:00:12.509> Les<00:00:12.660> Paul<00:00:27.619> when<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.650> RC

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
really great with Les Paul when you RC

really great with Les Paul when you RC
booster<00:00:29.099> sit<00:00:29.519> same<00:00:29.670> concept<00:00:30.119> again

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.540 

the<00:00:55.140> same<00:00:55.320> concept<00:00:55.739> with<00:00:55.829> kicking<00:00:56.039> on<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.309> AC

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the same concept with kicking on the AC

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.459 
the same concept with kicking on the AC
booster<00:00:56.850> just<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.210> give<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.539> top<00:00:58.050> thing<00:00:58.350> that

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
booster just to give it a top thing that

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:23.390 
booster just to give it a top thing that
I<00:00:58.530> like

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.410 

same<00:01:24.400> thing<00:01:24.610> you<00:01:24.730> can<00:01:24.850> back<00:01:25.000> off<00:01:25.180> with<00:01:25.330> the

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
same thing you can back off with the

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.210 
same thing you can back off with the
intensity<00:01:25.810> of<00:01:25.870> your<00:01:25.930> fingers

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:02:09.109 

with<00:01:31.220> a<00:01:31.250> little<00:01:31.460> Distortion

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.190

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
well it's the same things I was talking

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.040 
well it's the same things I was talking
about<00:02:15.580> before<00:02:15.730> it<00:02:16.000> just<00:02:16.120> sounds<00:02:16.450> so<00:02:16.480> natural

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
about before it just sounds so natural

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.440 
about before it just sounds so natural
and<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:18.700> know<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.880> tube<00:02:19.060> screamers<00:02:19.360> are

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
and you know the tube screamers are

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.700 
and you know the tube screamers are
great<00:02:19.570> I<00:02:19.630> use<00:02:19.780> nothing<00:02:20.050> but<00:02:20.080> to<00:02:20.290> screamers<00:02:20.650> I

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
great I use nothing but to screamers I

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:21.870 
great I use nothing but to screamers I
think<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:20.890> had<00:02:21.010> some<00:02:21.160> old<00:02:21.310> tubes<00:02:21.610> because<00:02:21.850> I

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
think I had some old tubes because I

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.550 
think I had some old tubes because I
used<00:02:22.060> four<00:02:22.210> years<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.840> they<00:02:23.140> just<00:02:23.170> never<00:02:23.350> had

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
used four years and they just never had

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.960 
used four years and they just never had
enough<00:02:23.740> bottom<00:02:24.130> they<00:02:24.400> never<00:02:24.580> went<00:02:24.700> over<00:02:24.880> the

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
enough bottom they never went over the

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.580 
enough bottom they never went over the
top<00:02:25.180> enough<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.690> this<00:02:25.750> does<00:02:25.990> all<00:02:26.140> that<00:02:26.350> you

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
top enough and this does all that you

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.170 
top enough and this does all that you
know<00:02:26.680> some<00:02:27.400> pedals<00:02:27.670> would<00:02:27.760> do<00:02:27.850> one<00:02:28.030> thing

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
know some pedals would do one thing

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.340 
know some pedals would do one thing
really<00:02:28.360> well<00:02:28.570> some<00:02:28.840> pedals<00:02:29.140> are<00:02:29.260> like

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
really well some pedals are like

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.200 
really well some pedals are like
over-the-top<00:02:29.650> screaming<00:02:30.280> rock<00:02:30.520> sound<00:02:30.940> and

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
over-the-top screaming rock sound and

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.510 
over-the-top screaming rock sound and
that's<00:02:31.630> great<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.350> but<00:02:33.070> then<00:02:33.190> if<00:02:33.280> you<00:02:33.340> try<00:02:33.459> to

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
that's great and but then if you try to

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.740 
that's great and but then if you try to
get<00:02:33.640> anything<00:02:33.820> sensitive<00:02:34.240> out<00:02:34.450> of<00:02:34.540> them<00:02:34.630> you

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
get anything sensitive out of them you

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.190 
get anything sensitive out of them you
can't

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
can't

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.780 
can't
and<00:02:35.620> there's<00:02:35.800> pedals<00:02:36.160> that<00:02:36.310> are<00:02:36.400> kind<00:02:36.550> of<00:02:36.580> sets

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
and there's pedals that are kind of sets

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:37.949 
and there's pedals that are kind of sets
of<00:02:36.880> a<00:02:36.940> nice<00:02:37.060> bluesy<00:02:37.420> thing<00:02:37.540> but<00:02:37.690> they<00:02:37.750> can't

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
of a nice bluesy thing but they can't

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.300 
of a nice bluesy thing but they can't
get<00:02:38.050> over<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.290> top<00:02:38.470> and<00:02:38.800> to<00:02:38.890> me<00:02:38.980> that<00:02:39.130> this

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
get over the top and to me that this

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.380 
get over the top and to me that this
pedal<00:02:39.580> does<00:02:39.700> kind<00:02:39.880> of<00:02:39.910> everything<00:02:40.270> especially

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
pedal does kind of everything especially

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.449 
pedal does kind of everything especially
with<00:02:40.660> them<00:02:40.750> in<00:02:41.020> tandem<00:02:41.410> like<00:02:41.890> I<00:02:42.010> used<00:02:42.220> them<00:02:42.340> I

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
with them in tandem like I used them I

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.430 
with them in tandem like I used them I
can<00:02:42.610> always<00:02:42.850> get<00:02:43.090> a<00:02:43.150> great<00:02:43.420> no<00:02:44.080> matter<00:02:44.260> where

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440

extra inspiration to play well because

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.090 
extra inspiration to play well because
almost<00:02:55.690> harmonics<00:02:56.260> jump<00:02:56.560> out<00:02:56.680> you<00:02:56.950> know<00:02:57.070> I

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
almost harmonics jump out you know I

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.010 
almost harmonics jump out you know I
don't<00:02:57.370> know<00:02:57.430> what<00:02:57.640> it<00:02:57.730> is<00:02:57.760> it<00:02:58.000> just<00:02:58.150> sounds<00:02:58.570> you

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
don't know what it is it just sounds you

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
don't know what it is it just sounds you
can<00:02:59.110> back<00:02:59.290> it<00:02:59.440> down<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.650> this<00:02:59.709> house<00:02:59.890> like<00:02:59.950> a

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
can back it down and this house like a

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.780 
can back it down and this house like a
great<00:03:00.220> little<00:03:00.400> over<00:03:00.489> driven<00:03:00.850> amplifier<00:03:05.790> well

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
great little over driven amplifier well

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.160 
great little over driven amplifier well
it's<00:03:06.940> not<00:03:07.060> better<00:03:07.270> it's<00:03:07.540> just<00:03:07.690> different<00:03:07.870> for

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
it's not better it's just different for
