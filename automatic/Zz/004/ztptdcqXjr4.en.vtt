hi<00:00:08.580> in<00:00:08.940> this<00:00:09.059> short<00:00:09.269> video<00:00:09.510> we'll<00:00:10.019> be<00:00:10.050> looking

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
hi in this short video we'll be looking

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.070 
hi in this short video we'll be looking
at<00:00:10.559> Cubase<00:00:11.130> 7<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:11.759> Windows<00:00:12.090> 7<00:00:12.300> round-trip

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
at Cubase 7 and Windows 7 round-trip

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.129 
at Cubase 7 and Windows 7 round-trip
latency<00:00:13.280> to<00:00:14.280> test<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.639> round-trip<00:00:15.059> latency

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
latency to test a round-trip latency

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.260 
latency to test a round-trip latency
using<00:00:16.139> Cubase<00:00:16.500> 7<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.160> Windows<00:00:17.550> 7<00:00:17.760> we<00:00:18.210> are

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
using Cubase 7 and Windows 7 we are

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.540 
using Cubase 7 and Windows 7 we are
using<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.720> zodiac<00:00:19.170> as<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> source<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:20.279> left

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
using the zodiac as a source the left

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.340 
using the zodiac as a source the left
signal<00:00:21.000> goes<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.359> ad<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.990> your<00:00:22.170> EIN

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
signal goes to the ad of your EIN

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.420 
signal goes to the ad of your EIN
through<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.340> USB<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.269> D<00:00:24.480> aw<00:00:24.960> out<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.980> USB

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
through the USB to the D aw out the USB

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.730 
through the USB to the D aw out the USB
to<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.699> da<00:00:26.970> every<00:00:27.420> Orion<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.900> then<00:00:28.349> directly

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
to the da every Orion and then directly

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.099 
to the da every Orion and then directly
into<00:00:29.099> e<00:00:29.130> Eclipse<00:00:29.460> for<00:00:29.670> recording<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.869> right

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
into e Eclipse for recording the right

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.569 
into e Eclipse for recording the right
channel<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.650> zodiac<00:00:31.859> friend<00:00:32.399> goes

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
channel of the zodiac friend goes

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.180 
channel of the zodiac friend goes
directly<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.480> Eclipse<00:00:33.780> for<00:00:34.380> recording<00:00:34.890> so

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
directly to the Eclipse for recording so

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.470 
directly to the Eclipse for recording so
we<00:00:35.280> can<00:00:35.430> compare<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.850> signals<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.360> see

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
we can compare the signals and see

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.000 
we can compare the signals and see
what's<00:00:36.660> really<00:00:36.809> going<00:00:36.930> on<00:00:37.290> with<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.530> latency

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
what's really going on with the latency

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.310 
what's really going on with the latency
if<00:00:38.760> we<00:00:38.969> move<00:00:39.149> into<00:00:39.329> our<00:00:39.540> control<00:00:39.809> panel<00:00:40.050> now

moving<00:00:53.670> into<00:00:53.789> Cubase<00:00:54.300> now<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.899> can<00:00:55.050> see<00:00:55.199> I've

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
moving into Cubase now you can see I've

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.439 
moving into Cubase now you can see I've
created<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.829> stereo<00:00:56.219> channel<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:57.270> is

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
created a stereo channel this is

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.779 
created a stereo channel this is
monitoring<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.140> ad<00:00:58.350> 1<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.039> then<00:00:59.340> being<00:00:59.550> sent

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
monitoring the ad 1 and then being sent

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.479 
monitoring the ad 1 and then being sent
out<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> da<00:01:00.510> one<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.199> Orion<00:01:01.469> 32<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.370> be

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
out of the da one of the Orion 32 to be

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.390 
out of the da one of the Orion 32 to be
eclipsed<00:01:02.789> analog<00:01:03.390> 1<00:01:03.570> input<00:01:03.949> now<00:01:04.949> I'll<00:01:05.159> send

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
eclipsed analog 1 input now I'll send

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.039 
eclipsed analog 1 input now I'll send
the<00:01:05.519> impulse<00:01:05.909> for<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.299> round-trip<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.960> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
the impulse for the round-trip of the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.130 
the impulse for the round-trip of the
converter<00:01:07.610> by<00:01:08.610> recording<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.510> then<00:01:09.689> playing

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
converter by recording and then playing

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.179 
converter by recording and then playing
back<00:01:10.409> from<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.710> same<00:01:10.950> source<00:01:15.590> if<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.740> now<00:01:16.890> stop

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
back from the same source if I now stop

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.310 
back from the same source if I now stop
this<00:01:17.400> we<00:01:17.640> can<00:01:17.790> see<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.299> our<00:01:18.390> top<00:01:18.659> signal<00:01:19.140> is

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
this we can see that our top signal is

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.140 
this we can see that our top signal is
the<00:01:19.680> direct<00:01:20.100> signal<00:01:20.369> recorded<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
the direct signal recorded to the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.050 
the direct signal recorded to the
Eclipse<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.350> bottom<00:01:22.680> signal<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
Eclipse and the bottom signal is the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.730 
Eclipse and the bottom signal is the
source<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.540> has<00:01:24.750> gone<00:01:24.930> through<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
source that has gone through the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.490 
source that has gone through the
converter<00:01:26.240> as<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.420> can<00:01:27.570> see<00:01:27.810> from<00:01:28.080> our<00:01:28.229> top

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
converter as you can see from our top

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.219 
converter as you can see from our top
signal<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.670> direct<00:01:30.119> source<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
signal this is the direct source and the

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.890 
signal this is the direct source and the
bottom<00:01:31.500> signal<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.130> Orion<00:01:32.220> 32<00:01:32.909> as<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.780> can

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
bottom signal is the Orion 32 as you can

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.920 
bottom signal is the Orion 32 as you can
see<00:01:34.110> we<00:01:34.290> have<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.799> latency<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.759> 21<00:01:36.329> milliseconds

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
see we have a latency of 21 milliseconds

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.800 
see we have a latency of 21 milliseconds
here<00:01:37.079> now<00:01:37.950> I'm<00:01:38.100> going<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.369> change<00:01:38.670> for<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> 0<00:01:39.329> USB

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
here now I'm going to change for a 0 USB

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.960 
here now I'm going to change for a 0 USB
streaming<00:01:40.259> mode<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.979> Mini<00:01:41.750> latency<00:01:43.729> now<00:01:44.729> let's

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
streaming mode to Mini latency now let's

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.370 
streaming mode to Mini latency now let's
send<00:01:45.149> our<00:01:45.299> impulse<00:01:45.689> around<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.079> pervert

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
send our impulse around the pervert

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.899 
send our impulse around the pervert
again<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:46.950> see<00:01:47.159> what<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.399> difference<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:47.880> in

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
again and see what the difference is in

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:56.390 
again and see what the difference is in
latency

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.039 

as<00:01:57.400> you<00:01:57.580> can<00:01:57.700> see<00:01:57.909> using<00:01:58.330> a<00:01:58.540> minimum<00:01:58.900> latency

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
as you can see using a minimum latency

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.380 
as you can see using a minimum latency
setting<00:01:59.740> we<00:02:00.100> can<00:02:00.130> have<00:02:00.400> a<00:02:00.430> reading<00:02:00.850> of<00:02:01.060> 5

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
setting we can have a reading of 5

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.380 
setting we can have a reading of 5
milliseconds<00:02:02.050> latency<00:02:02.909> as<00:02:03.909> you<00:02:04.090> can<00:02:04.240> see

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
milliseconds latency as you can see

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.050 
milliseconds latency as you can see
using<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:04.960> Rhine<00:02:05.110> 32<00:02:05.680> and<00:02:06.040> antelopes<00:02:06.640> custom
