turbine cars the next couple of years
and<00:03:02.680> what<00:03:03.680> happened<00:03:04.100> is<00:03:04.280> the

and what happened is the

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.630 
and what happened is the
the<00:03:04.790> race<00:03:05.300> officials<00:03:06.220> didn't<00:03:07.220> really<00:03:07.430> like

the race officials didn't really like
these<00:03:07.819> turbine<00:03:08.210> cars<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:09.470> they<00:03:09.680> kept

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
these turbine cars and they kept

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.220 
these turbine cars and they kept
changing<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:10.490> rules<00:03:10.790> to<00:03:11.450> make<00:03:11.600> it<00:03:11.750> harder<00:03:12.110> and

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
changing the rules to make it harder and

harder<00:03:12.290> on<00:03:12.740> them<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:14.050> eventually<00:03:15.050> they<00:03:15.680> put

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
harder on them and eventually they put

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.830 
harder on them and eventually they put
so<00:03:16.100> many<00:03:16.190> restrictions<00:03:16.400> on<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.390> turbines

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
so many restrictions on the turbines

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.260 
so many restrictions on the turbines
that<00:03:18.170> they<00:03:18.920> were<00:03:19.040> no<00:03:19.190> longer<00:03:19.340> competitive<00:03:19.790> and

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
that they were no longer competitive and

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.620 
that they were no longer competitive and
so<00:03:20.780> that<00:03:21.050> wonderful<00:03:21.680> era<00:03:21.920> is<00:03:22.280> over<00:03:22.520> but<00:03:23.300> we're
