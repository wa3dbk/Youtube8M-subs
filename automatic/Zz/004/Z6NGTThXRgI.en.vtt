the seat the way it hooks in sits a
little<00:01:21.270> bit<00:01:21.509> forward<00:01:21.840> from<00:01:22.319> where<00:01:22.649> most

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:22.889 
little bit forward from where most

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:26.539 
little bit forward from where most
kayaks<00:01:23.549> sit<00:01:24.380> you<00:01:25.380> can<00:01:25.409> see<00:01:25.679> these<00:01:25.799> back<00:01:26.069> straps

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
are kind of crisscross the way they're

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.599 
are kind of crisscross the way they're
designed<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:29.039> be<00:01:29.659> fastened<00:01:30.659> in<00:01:31.369> and<00:01:32.369> I'm<00:01:32.459> not

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:32.609 
designed to be fastened in and I'm not

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:34.789 
designed to be fastened in and I'm not
quite<00:01:32.759> sure<00:01:32.819> why<00:01:33.329> it's<00:01:33.509> done<00:01:33.719> that<00:01:33.929> way<00:01:34.109> next

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
quite sure why it's done that way next

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.010 
quite sure why it's done that way next
time<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.009> talk<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.369> Jim<00:01:35.609> the<00:01:35.789> the<00:01:36.569> creator<00:01:36.869> of

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
time I talk to Jim the the creator of

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.319 
time I talk to Jim the the creator of
this<00:01:37.170> boat<00:01:37.469> I'll<00:01:37.740> find<00:01:38.549> out<00:01:38.700> what<00:01:38.969> the<00:01:39.090> thought

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
this boat I'll find out what the thought

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.319 
this boat I'll find out what the thought
was<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.569> know<00:01:39.749> there's<00:01:39.990> something<00:01:40.200> behind<00:01:40.709> that

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
was I know there's something behind that

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.819 
was I know there's something behind that
it<00:01:42.329> would<00:01:42.420> be<00:01:42.479> interesting<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.899> see<00:01:43.109> why

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
it would be interesting to see why

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.590 
it would be interesting to see why
exactly<00:01:44.009> it's<00:01:44.399> set<00:01:44.579> up<00:01:44.609> that<00:01:44.850> way<00:01:45.030> but<00:01:45.389> it

without the fear of water coming in and
this<00:03:48.569> is<00:03:48.720> not<00:03:48.900> offshore<00:03:49.470> in<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.680> big<00:03:49.919> chop

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
this is not offshore in the big chop

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.420 
this is not offshore in the big chop
this<00:03:50.489> is<00:03:50.639> just<00:03:50.879> in<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.120> marina<00:03:51.590> but<00:03:52.590> there<00:03:53.250> was

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
this is just in the marina but there was

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.550 
this is just in the marina but there was
no<00:03:53.699> feel<00:03:54.030> that<00:03:54.329> it<00:03:54.419> was<00:03:54.599> that<00:03:54.989> it<00:03:55.079> was<00:03:55.229> going<00:03:55.530> to

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
no feel that it was that it was going to

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.280 
no feel that it was that it was going to
sink<00:03:55.949> any<00:03:56.099> more<00:03:56.340> than<00:03:56.489> what<00:03:56.669> it<00:03:56.790> did<00:03:57.000> so<00:03:57.419> rough

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
sink any more than what it did so rough

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.409 
sink any more than what it did so rough
chop<00:03:58.560> maybe<00:03:58.829> not<00:03:59.069> but<00:03:59.430> in<00:03:59.669> general<00:03:59.970> conditions

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419

chop maybe not but in general conditions
I<00:04:00.569> think<00:04:00.750> that's<00:04:00.900> going<00:04:01.019> to<00:04:01.079> be<00:04:01.139> easily

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
I think that's going to be easily

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.289 
I think that's going to be easily
