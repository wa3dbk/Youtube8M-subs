00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.760
 hello my good i'm glad 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.500
 greet you on your channel and 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.830
 Today I want to tell you about the updates 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.480
 which I saw in the faberlik catalog 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.110
 updates in October but also understand that 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.359
 it's not even new 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:32.019
 updated old collection this 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:34.059
 a collection of secretaries she's made very 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:37.120
 interesting to me very interesting 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:39.309
 design performance is not nice to keep 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.650
 cosmetics in such a package in their hands 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.800
 unpleasant and very enjoy that 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.570
 concerns its internal properties let's 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.360
 I'll tell you something now. 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.320
 First, I ordered myself such 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.000
 foundation double agent here 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.430
 cargo on the mountain is double tonal here 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.809
 cream and here bases on the one hand can 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.710
 It seems that it is not very convenient 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:05.710
 because the color of this foundation 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:09.460
 just one that is a shade of everything 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.920
 only one but I have been before 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.990
 so I sometimes use this principle 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.539
 the color minimum fits more or less i 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.970
 I would not put a base on my face first 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:20.229
 very pleasant 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.220
 really holds makeup well 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.990
 more foundation on the face or in the 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.610
 principle here you can mix the base and 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.369
 concealer to get such 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:34.030
 shade but i can't say he is there 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.770
 much tones of it will be brighter that 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.149
 It turned out such a topic that fits 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.000
 your skin can principle them 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.349
 use and so mixing base and 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.030
 respectively foundation here 

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:44.739
 very large packaging for quality 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.899
 Coverage required quite a bit 

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:49.119
 literally there scold three peas 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.840
 so I think this cream is enough 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.099
 Economical I want to say that he is fat 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.080
 too heavy therefore not always you want 

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:58.720
 I always powder him and 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.570
 as for me I tried to put it 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.690
 brushes 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.610
 brush she badly leaves stains 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.700
 so I like to put it on 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.259
 fingers and 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.729
 I will say that the texture is quite difficult 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.010
 so if you like light textures 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.709
 probably this foundation is not for you 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.940
 yes and what I ordered the secretaries is this 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:22.240
 such a triple say so too 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.800
 multifunctional triple corrector 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.640
 actually here here is solid 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.709
 corrector is here i think 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.900
 less called concealer and now with this 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.630
 sides here is such a ball 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.810
 I think for better distribution 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:41.420
 applying actually concealer 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.870
 under the eyes for example if we talk about here 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.670
 This one is a corrector, then it is enough, but in 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.830
 principle not bad masks well but 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.940
 color for example it does not suit me because 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:56.239
 that he lies on my face here this one 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.340
 concealer I liked a lot more I 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.410
 I basically use it not only under 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.220
 the eye and even the problem areas 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.019
 locally the fact is that it is not like 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.820
 ordinary concealer that is not so 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:12.620
 vadim him denis you are not very liquid 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.030
 fairly thick cover of the well 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.579
 dark circles under the eyes 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.440
 if we talk about this video here 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:22.489
 in fact, I did not use it 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:26.030
 because I 'm not very comfortable and rather 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:28.400
 just if someone does not have a cream 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.930
 for eyelids with a roller can be applied cream and 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.000
 use this video to 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.760
 make a massage probably like this 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.470
 there is more such a fit 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.290
 but basically by itself here 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.970
 proofreader is not a bad one of all these 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.810
 three things I liked most 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.790
 concealer yes and I will tell you from the heart 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.100
 the mascara is very interesting too so carved 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.560
 here are looking pink some 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.370
 items but very interesting packaging 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.320
 beautiful and mascara if talking about her 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.549
 quality by its properties, it is by the way 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:03.380
 super volume gives a big volume but I 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.480
 I would not say that it gives a big 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.400
 volume in principle is mascara very 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.810
 delicate looks good in the afternoon because 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.780
 what does she share eyelashes 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.450
 some long does not make them but such 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.639
 easy light gives volume for example 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.160
 to do makeup for the evening then at night I 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:22.400
 I prefer another one to my eyelashes 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.590
 were more such theatrical here 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.630
 eyelashes becomes more or less 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.360
 natural more gadget alive 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.730
 well painted my lumps she doesn't 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.350
 leaves cilia well shared i 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.810
 I think it would not be superfluous to add it 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.320
 also hypoallergenic following what you 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.400
 I want to show it 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.750
 baked eye shadow 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.550
 I do not remember the name right now but 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.830
 I will definitely write in the description under this 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.140
 video of course I liked the packaging 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.570
 I liked the design and colors here 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.830
 very rich with good 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.020
 amenable to shading 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.300
 I naturally do not use the applicator 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.550
 shadows by the way, you can use dry and 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.060
 wet way they have silk texture 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:04.220
 they stand and grab them probably until 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.820
 I still have a couple of things in the evening 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.320
 first it is such a powder which is also 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.320
 can be worn dry and wet 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.890
 i don't really like it because 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:19.910
 it is applied unevenly in my opinion 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:21.440
 she light creates a light veil on her face 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.810
 I liked that it does not weigh down 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.330
 the face does not make the mask only here 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.919
 it is not difficult enough with this sponge 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:32.750
 put this tunnel 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:34.700
 this powder on my face and so i'm here 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.030
 how do i use the brush now 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.200
 adjusted under the erased letters 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.310
 a small brush for all 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.860
 put it on face 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.710
 powder holds makeup well and in principle 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.380
 I can say they are not bad 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:51.890
 I would probably give her four from 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:57.080
 five because i start i don't know very much 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:58.699
 as if low, I would even say high but 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.509
 I will not say that it works on 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:05.150
 its price because not not something 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:07.009
 special good just powder for the face 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.430
 and the last one is very me 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:12.889
 also liked the design and its 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.590
 qualities and properties of this lipstick I do not 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:19.159
 I also remember her name, too , but secretaries 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:22.310
 I have her 47 19 number I will 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:23.539
 I leave in the description below this I chose 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:27.129
 specially such a shade is enough 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:31.190
 delicate tender pink slightly peach 

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:34.879
 lipstick feels good on lips 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:37.789
 it is not applied in a thick layer 

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:41.479
 and a thin layer, it does not numb 

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:43.699
 there is a very even color applied 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:45.259
 very nice and lately i 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:47.750
 really her very very often 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:50.779
 I use it very often I scour my own 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:52.729
 bags these were all products so 

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:53.870
 let's say the news of october which about which 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:55.729
 I wanted to tell you 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.800
 thank you so much for watching and 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:07:01.029
 good for both good mood and 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.029
 see you next video 

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.930
