just because I'm a big fan of the

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.840 
just because I'm a big fan of the
streamlight<00:00:19.949> models<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.490> are<00:00:20.520> kind<00:00:20.789> of

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
streamlight models that are kind of

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.269 
streamlight models that are kind of
similar<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.330> those<00:00:21.480> they<00:00:22.230> make<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.529> prion<00:00:22.980> and

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
similar to those they make the prion and

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.980 
similar to those they make the prion and
then<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.490> prion<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.970> which<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.810> bigger

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
then the prion to which is the bigger

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.960 
then the prion to which is the bigger
and<00:00:25.170> smaller<00:00:25.350> version<00:00:25.830> just<00:00:26.430> like<00:00:26.580> streamline

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
and smaller version just like streamline

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.169 
and smaller version just like streamline
has<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.330> micro<00:00:27.660> stream<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.260> stylus<00:00:28.769> pro

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179 
has the micro stream and the stylus pro

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.160

guys<00:00:38.370> can<00:00:38.520> see<00:00:38.579> here<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.840> midnight

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
guys can see here this is in a midnight

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.319 
guys can see here this is in a midnight
blue<00:00:40.739> color<00:00:41.250> they<00:00:41.640> do<00:00:41.700> come<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.149> several

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
blue color they do come in several

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.209 
blue color they do come in several
different<00:00:42.510> colors<00:00:43.020> but<00:00:43.050> who's<00:00:43.770> actually<00:00:43.890> my

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
different colors but who's actually my

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.729 
different colors but who's actually my
favorite<00:00:44.460> color<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:45.149> figured<00:00:45.500> it<00:00:46.500> was<00:00:46.710> a

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
favorite color and I figured it was a

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.880 
favorite color and I figured it was a
good<00:00:47.000> replacement<00:00:48.000> for<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.809> black<00:00:49.289> flashlight

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
good replacement for a black flashlight

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.889 
good replacement for a black flashlight
you<00:00:50.039> know<00:00:50.129> normally<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:51.120> do<00:00:51.270> find<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.719> lot

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
you know normally you do find that a lot

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.080 
you know normally you do find that a lot
of<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> flashlights<00:00:52.530> out<00:00:52.770> there<00:00:53.430> are<00:00:53.640> black

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
of the flashlights out there are black

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.060 
of the flashlights out there are black
in<00:00:54.120> color<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.780> figured<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.289> know<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.620> pick<00:00:55.920> up

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
in color so I figured you know I pick up

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.380 
in color so I figured you know I pick up
something<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.670> little<00:00:56.760> bit<00:00:56.940> different<00:00:57.270> now

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
something a little bit different now

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.750 
something a little bit different now
this<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.199> called<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.680> prion<00:00:59.010> pen<00:00:59.280> light<00:00:59.520> and

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
this is called the prion pen light and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.150 
this is called the prion pen light and
mainly<00:01:00.449> because<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.870> resembles<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.590> pen<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.980> mean

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
mainly because it resembles a pen I mean

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.650 
mainly because it resembles a pen I mean
if<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.370> were<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:02.850> in<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.059> pocket<00:01:03.300> it

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
if you were to have this in a pocket it

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.149 
if you were to have this in a pocket it
would<00:01:03.899> definitely<00:01:04.290> look<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.769> little<00:01:04.890> bit<00:01:05.040> more

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
would definitely look a little bit more

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.190 
would definitely look a little bit more
like<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> pen<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.790> tapers<00:01:06.119> down<00:01:06.150> at<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.049> end

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
like a pen it tapers down at the end

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.560 
like a pen it tapers down at the end
right<00:01:07.350> here<00:01:07.590> like<00:01:07.770> pens<00:01:08.040> normally<00:01:08.490> do<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.909> you

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
the tell caps which there I just looks

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.870 
the tell caps which there I just looks
like<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.820> pen<00:01:15.090> but<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.799> in<00:01:16.799> regards<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.460> how<00:01:17.729> this

versus<00:01:33.450> calling<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.840> flashlight<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.290> mean<00:01:34.500> it

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
versus calling it a flashlight I mean it

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.859 
versus calling it a flashlight I mean it
is<00:01:35.009> what<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.310> now<00:01:36.090> like<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.360> mentioned<00:01:36.600> this

anodized aluminum body which is uh you
know<00:01:43.560> it's<00:01:43.890> very<00:01:44.130> nice<00:01:44.340> it's<00:01:44.759> very<00:01:45.180> sturdy<00:01:45.540> now

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
know it's very nice it's very sturdy now

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.319 
know it's very nice it's very sturdy now
the<00:01:46.409> other<00:01:46.740> color<00:01:47.070> itself<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.729> lot<00:01:48.000> richer

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
the other color itself is a lot richer

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.030 
the other color itself is a lot richer
in<00:01:48.659> real<00:01:48.869> life<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.380> other<00:01:49.560> cameras<00:01:49.890> not

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
in real life and other cameras not

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.280 
in real life and other cameras not
really<00:01:50.250> doing<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.790> too<00:01:51.570> good<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.869> justice

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
really doing it too good of a justice

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.310 
really doing it too good of a justice
but<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:53.430> anodizing<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.299> it's<00:01:54.570> very<00:01:54.780> nice<00:01:54.990> on

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
but the anodizing is it's very nice on

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.260 
but the anodizing is it's very nice on
here<00:01:55.740> I've<00:01:56.100> been<00:01:56.280> using<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.759> for<00:01:56.790> about<00:01:57.119> a

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
here I've been using it for about a

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.200 
here I've been using it for about a
month<00:01:57.540> now<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:58.189> rotated<00:01:59.189> into<00:01:59.399> my<00:01:59.579> EDC<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.030> I've

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
month now I rotated into my EDC and I've

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.580 
month now I rotated into my EDC and I've
been<00:02:00.360> carrying<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.869> my<00:02:00.930> pocket<00:02:01.110> for<00:02:01.409> about

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
been carrying it in my pocket for about

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.649 
been carrying it in my pocket for about
a<00:02:01.619> month<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.939> really<00:02:03.329> can't<00:02:03.570> see

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
a month and you really can't see

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.170 
a month and you really can't see
anywhere<00:02:04.380> at<00:02:04.770> all<00:02:04.979> on<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.460> actual<00:02:05.670> flashlight

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
anywhere at all on the actual flashlight

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.499 
anywhere at all on the actual flashlight
now<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.649> bezel<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.129> also<00:02:08.670> aluminum<00:02:09.179> down

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
now the the bezel is also aluminum down

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.480 
now the the bezel is also aluminum down
here<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.069> the<00:02:11.069> clip

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
here and the clip

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
you do get a sturdy feeling flashlight

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.800 
you do get a sturdy feeling flashlight
now<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.340> main<00:02:17.520> difference<00:02:17.550> between<00:02:18.000> this<00:02:18.570> one

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
now the main difference between this one

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.360 
now the main difference between this one
and<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.140> other<00:02:19.710> ones<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.100> I<00:02:20.130> mentioned

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
and the other ones that I mentioned

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.580 
and the other ones that I mentioned
before<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.510> this<00:02:21.810> one<00:02:21.990> does<00:02:22.140> have<00:02:22.170> three

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
before is that this one does have three

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.380 
before is that this one does have three
different<00:02:22.890> modes<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.430> get<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.610> low<00:02:23.850> mode<00:02:24.120> at

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
different modes you get a low mode at

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.500 
different modes you get a low mode at
five<00:02:24.870> lumens<00:02:25.320> you<00:02:25.980> get<00:02:26.130> a<00:02:26.160> medium<00:02:26.550> mode<00:02:26.790> at<00:02:27.060> 50

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
five lumens you get a medium mode at 50

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.020 
five lumens you get a medium mode at 50
lumens<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.020> you<00:02:28.200> get<00:02:28.320> a<00:02:28.350> high<00:02:28.620> mode<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.190> 180

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
lumens and you get a high mode and 180

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.350 
lumens and you get a high mode and 180
lumens<00:02:30.480> now<00:02:31.050> this<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.290> powered<00:02:31.740> by<00:02:31.770> two<00:02:32.550> triple

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
lumens now this is powered by two triple

the one thing that i did find with this
particular<00:02:49.410> light<00:02:49.890> versus<00:02:50.370> let's<00:02:51.060> say<00:02:51.210> this

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
particular light versus let's say this

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.920 
particular light versus let's say this
the<00:02:51.660> streamlight<00:02:52.200> stylus<00:02:52.680> pro<00:02:52.860> is<00:02:53.160> that<00:02:53.930> in

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
the streamlight stylus pro is that in

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.630 
the streamlight stylus pro is that in
the<00:02:55.230> high<00:02:55.440> mode<00:02:55.740> you<00:02:56.130> know<00:02:56.250> since<00:02:56.490> it's

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
the high mode you know since it's

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.030 
the high mode you know since it's
pumping<00:02:56.940> out<00:02:57.060> 180<00:02:57.600> lumens<00:02:58.110> you<00:02:58.620> do<00:02:58.800> get<00:02:58.980> a

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
pumping out 180 lumens you do get a

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.770 
pumping out 180 lumens you do get a
little<00:02:59.280> bit<00:02:59.490> of<00:02:59.580> warmth<00:02:59.940> so<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.630> starts

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
little bit of warmth so it starts

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.680 
little bit of warmth so it starts
getting<00:03:00.990> hot<00:03:01.290> down<00:03:01.350> right<00:03:02.130> down<00:03:02.310> here<00:03:02.690> right

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
you know if I were to be using it for

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.790 
you know if I were to be using it for
over<00:03:05.940> a<00:03:05.970> minute<00:03:06.240> of<00:03:06.540> constant<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.500> the

constant light coming out so you know

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.120 
constant light coming out so you know
that's<00:03:09.720> always<00:03:10.080> something<00:03:10.530> good<00:03:10.830> to<00:03:10.920> note

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
that's always something good to note

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.190 
that's always something good to note
again<00:03:11.940> that<00:03:12.000> was<00:03:12.240> my<00:03:12.390> experience<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:13.080> don't

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
again that was my experience I don't

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.570 
again that was my experience I don't
know<00:03:13.260> if<00:03:13.380> it<00:03:13.500> has<00:03:13.530> anything<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:14.010> do<00:03:14.220> with<00:03:14.250> the

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
know if it has anything to do with the

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.800 
know if it has anything to do with the
batteries<00:03:15.000> that<00:03:15.180> are<00:03:15.210> in<00:03:15.420> there<00:03:15.600> or<00:03:15.660> anything

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
batteries that are in there or anything

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.600 
batteries that are in there or anything
like<00:03:15.930> that<00:03:16.080> but<00:03:16.440> that's<00:03:16.980> just<00:03:17.070> what<00:03:17.310> I<00:03:17.340> found

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
like that but that's just what I found

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.150 
like that but that's just what I found
now<00:03:18.330> the<00:03:18.990> way<00:03:19.110> that<00:03:19.290> you<00:03:19.380> activate<00:03:19.830> the<00:03:19.920> nodes

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
now the way that you activate the nodes

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.160 
now the way that you activate the nodes
is<00:03:20.340> which<00:03:21.030> is<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.210> little<00:03:21.510> bit<00:03:21.690> of<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.840> drawback

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
is which is a little bit of a drawback

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.650 
is which is a little bit of a drawback
for<00:03:22.380> me<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.560> prefer<00:03:22.740> the<00:03:23.130> you<00:03:23.970> know<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.270> where

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
for me I prefer the you know the where

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.060 
for me I prefer the you know the where
you<00:03:24.750> can<00:03:24.900> lightly<00:03:25.260> press<00:03:25.590> it<00:03:25.740> in<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:25.890> latter

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
you can lightly press it in the latter

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.380 
you can lightly press it in the latter
come<00:03:26.280> on<00:03:26.430> so<00:03:26.610> you<00:03:26.700> don't<00:03:26.820> have<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:27.000> click<00:03:27.180> it<00:03:27.300> on

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
come on so you don't have to click it on

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.210 
come on so you don't have to click it on
with<00:03:27.960> this<00:03:28.080> particular<00:03:28.290> once<00:03:28.800> if<00:03:28.980> it's<00:03:29.130> a

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
with this particular once if it's a

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.740 
with this particular once if it's a
reverse<00:03:29.580> click<00:03:29.850> you<00:03:30.000> have<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.270> click<00:03:30.450> varane

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
reverse click you have to click varane

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.530 
reverse click you have to click varane
and<00:03:31.310> then<00:03:32.310> you<00:03:32.490> can<00:03:32.640> actually<00:03:32.790> lightly<00:03:33.300> tap

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
and then you can actually lightly tap

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.000 
and then you can actually lightly tap
and<00:03:33.840> go<00:03:34.020> through<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.290> different<00:03:34.410> mode<00:03:34.770> so<00:03:34.920> you

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
and go through the different mode so you

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.910 
and go through the different mode so you
get<00:03:35.160> low<00:03:35.370> medium<00:03:35.970> high<00:03:36.330> then<00:03:37.260> back<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.740> low

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
get low medium high then back to low

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.160 
get low medium high then back to low
medium<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.730> high<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:39.390> then<00:03:39.630> click<00:03:39.840> for<00:03:40.050> off

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
medium and high and then click for off

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.350 
medium and high and then click for off
now<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:41.070> can't<00:03:41.340> cycle<00:03:41.730> through<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:41.970> modes<00:03:42.180> by

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
now you can't cycle through the modes by

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.140 
now you can't cycle through the modes by
clicking<00:03:42.720> it<00:03:42.870> on<00:03:42.990> and<00:03:43.200> off<00:03:43.700> but<00:03:44.700> you<00:03:44.730> know<00:03:45.000> once

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
clicking it on and off but you know once

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.850 
clicking it on and off but you know once
you<00:03:45.270> have<00:03:45.450> it<00:03:45.570> on<00:03:45.690> then<00:03:45.930> you<00:03:46.050> can<00:03:46.200> just<00:03:46.380> cycle

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
you have it on then you can just cycle

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.280 
you have it on then you can just cycle
by<00:03:47.160> lightly<00:03:47.400> pressing<00:03:47.820> it<00:03:47.940> now<00:03:48.510> I<00:03:48.810> normally

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
by lightly pressing it now I normally

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.960 
by lightly pressing it now I normally
don't<00:03:49.470> use<00:03:49.800> the<00:03:50.040> different<00:03:50.190> modes<00:03:50.580> on<00:03:50.820> the

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
don't use the different modes on the

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.610 
don't use the different modes on the
flashlight<00:03:51.210> you<00:03:51.720> know<00:03:51.840> I<00:03:51.870> always<00:03:52.080> kind<00:03:52.410> of<00:03:52.500> go

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
flashlight you know I always kind of go

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.520 
flashlight you know I always kind of go
for<00:03:52.770> the<00:03:52.890> high<00:03:53.070> mode<00:03:53.370> on<00:03:53.580> there<00:03:53.820> so<00:03:54.360> again<00:03:55.200> you

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
for the high mode on there so again you

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.140 
for the high mode on there so again you
know<00:03:55.650> this<00:03:55.860> it<00:03:56.070> is<00:03:56.190> what<00:03:56.340> it<00:03:56.430> is<00:03:56.490> it<00:03:56.790> brings<00:03:57.030> the

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
know this it is what it is it brings the

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.970 
know this it is what it is it brings the
three<00:03:57.450> modes<00:03:57.660> so<00:03:57.960> obviously<00:03:58.500> you<00:03:58.620> have<00:03:58.740> to<00:03:58.860> go

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
three modes so obviously you have to go

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.950 
three modes so obviously you have to go
with<00:03:59.160> what<00:03:59.190> it<00:03:59.370> has<00:03:59.610> but<00:03:59.970> again<00:04:00.630> I<00:04:00.750> would<00:04:00.870> have

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
with what it has but again I would have

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.480 
with what it has but again I would have
preferred<00:04:01.050> if<00:04:01.380> you<00:04:01.500> just<00:04:01.800> had<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.160> out<00:04:02.370> the

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
preferred if you just had the out the

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.490 
preferred if you just had the out the
one<00:04:02.670> mode<00:04:02.940> but<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.690> good<00:04:03.840> thing<00:04:03.870> is<00:04:04.020> it<00:04:04.260> makes

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
one mode but the good thing is it makes

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.020 
one mode but the good thing is it makes
it<00:04:04.620> a<00:04:04.710> little<00:04:04.830> bit<00:04:05.010> more<00:04:05.190> versatile<00:04:05.760> you<00:04:06.000> can

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
it a little bit more versatile you can

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.240 
it a little bit more versatile you can
use<00:04:06.300> it<00:04:06.330> for<00:04:06.600> different<00:04:06.690> things<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.410> you<00:04:08.130> know

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
use it for different things and you know

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.760 
use it for different things and you know
if<00:04:08.400> you<00:04:08.730> don't<00:04:08.910> need<00:04:09.150> those<00:04:09.540> 180<00:04:10.140> lumens<00:04:10.650> you

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
if you don't need those 180 lumens you

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.770 
if you don't need those 180 lumens you
want<00:04:10.920> to<00:04:10.980> preserve<00:04:11.190> battery<00:04:11.250> life<00:04:11.700> or<00:04:12.180> you

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
want to preserve battery life or you

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.840 
want to preserve battery life or you
want<00:04:12.930> to<00:04:13.020> have<00:04:13.140> the<00:04:13.350> you<00:04:13.890> know<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.190> light<00:04:14.610> not

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
want to have the you know the light not

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.020 
want to have the you know the light not
be<00:04:15.030> as<00:04:15.209> bright<00:04:15.840> and<00:04:16.109> you<00:04:16.890> know<00:04:17.010> blinding<00:04:17.850> then

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
be as bright and you know blinding then

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.210 
be as bright and you know blinding then
you<00:04:18.150> can<00:04:18.299> just<00:04:18.450> you<00:04:19.049> know<00:04:19.109> ramp<00:04:19.739> it<00:04:19.890> down<00:04:20.040> to

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
you can just you know ramp it down to

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.490 
you can just you know ramp it down to
the<00:04:20.340> five<00:04:20.520> lumens<00:04:20.940> and<00:04:21.060> you<00:04:21.210> get<00:04:21.359> to<00:04:21.479> go<00:04:21.630> now<00:04:22.320> as

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
the five lumens and you get to go now as

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.110 
the five lumens and you get to go now as
always<00:04:22.800> by<00:04:22.950> way<00:04:23.100> of<00:04:23.130> comparison<00:04:23.370> I<00:04:23.820> like<00:04:24.000> to

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
always by way of comparison I like to

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.200 
always by way of comparison I like to
roll<00:04:24.300> in

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
roll in

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.820 
roll in
the<00:04:25.419> light<00:04:25.600> that<00:04:25.750> I<00:04:25.840> was<00:04:25.960> talking<00:04:26.139> about<00:04:26.410> which

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
the light that I was talking about which

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.460 
the light that I was talking about which
is<00:04:26.860> the<00:04:27.310> streamlight<00:04:28.030> stylus<00:04:28.389> pro<00:04:28.539> here<00:04:28.870> okay

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
is the streamlight stylus pro here okay

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.290 
is the streamlight stylus pro here okay
so<00:04:29.860> this<00:04:30.190> is<00:04:30.430> uh<00:04:30.750> it's<00:04:31.750> actually<00:04:32.080> one<00:04:32.259> of<00:04:32.289> the

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
so this is uh it's actually one of the

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.490 
so this is uh it's actually one of the
you<00:04:34.300> know<00:04:34.360> I<00:04:34.419> would<00:04:34.630> say<00:04:34.840> the<00:04:35.080> lights<00:04:35.289> that

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
you know I would say the lights that

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.920 
you know I would say the lights that
I've<00:04:35.590> carried<00:04:35.860> the<00:04:36.069> most<00:04:36.340> in<00:04:36.550> my<00:04:36.729> EDC<00:04:37.060> again

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.330 
it's very easy to carry but as you guys
can<00:04:40.479> see<00:04:40.539> it<00:04:40.870> doesn't<00:04:41.080> taper<00:04:41.410> down<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:42.220> way

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
can see it doesn't taper down the way

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.719 
can see it doesn't taper down the way
that<00:04:42.639> the<00:04:43.590> prion<00:04:44.590> pen<00:04:44.830> light<00:04:45.039> does<00:04:45.280> you<00:04:45.639> know

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
that the prion pen light does you know

that the prion pen light does you know
this<00:04:46.000> kind<00:04:46.720> of<00:04:46.750> figure<00:04:46.990> out<00:04:47.050> here<00:04:47.319> and<00:04:47.410> it

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
this kind of figure out here and it

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.140 
this kind of figure out here and it
tapers<00:04:47.620> down<00:04:47.830> so<00:04:48.160> it<00:04:48.220> fits<00:04:48.430> a<00:04:48.490> lot<00:04:48.639> nicer<00:04:48.849> in

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
tapers down so it fits a lot nicer in

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.240 
tapers down so it fits a lot nicer in
the<00:04:49.180> pocket<00:04:49.630> or<00:04:49.810> on<00:04:50.500> if<00:04:50.770> you<00:04:50.889> have<00:04:51.039> one<00:04:51.190> of

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
they're really really nice but as far as

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.279 
they're really really nice but as far as
size<00:04:57.759> goes<00:04:57.789> they're<00:04:58.449> basically<00:04:59.020> the<00:04:59.139> same

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
size goes they're basically the same

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:03.330 
size goes they're basically the same
size<00:05:00.300> same<00:05:01.300> with<00:05:01.570> their<00:05:01.870> I'll<00:05:02.169> put<00:05:02.410> one<00:05:03.220> on<00:05:03.310> top

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
size same with their I'll put one on top

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.620 
size same with their I'll put one on top
of<00:05:03.580> the<00:05:03.639> other<00:05:03.759> so<00:05:03.970> you<00:05:04.060> guys<00:05:04.180> can<00:05:04.330> see<00:05:04.389> the

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
of the other so you guys can see the

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.400 
of the other so you guys can see the
difference<00:05:04.960> there<00:05:05.490> now<00:05:06.490> I<00:05:06.520> find<00:05:06.940> the<00:05:07.180> the<00:05:08.080> clip

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
difference there now I find the the clip

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.360 
difference there now I find the the clip
on<00:05:08.590> the<00:05:08.979> on<00:05:09.580> the<00:05:10.470> streamlight<00:05:11.470> to<00:05:11.949> be<00:05:12.099> a<00:05:12.130> little

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
on the on the streamlight to be a little

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.089 
on the on the streamlight to be a little
bit<00:05:12.460> easier<00:05:13.300> to<00:05:13.810> get<00:05:14.080> in<00:05:14.320> and<00:05:14.410> out<00:05:14.590> just

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
bit easier to get in and out just

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:17.339 
bit easier to get in and out just
because<00:05:15.250> of<00:05:15.520> how<00:05:15.639> its<00:05:15.880> shaped<00:05:16.180> but<00:05:17.050> for<00:05:17.289> the

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:17.349 
because of how its shaped but for the

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:19.200 
because of how its shaped but for the
most<00:05:17.530> part<00:05:17.680> I<00:05:18.009> haven't<00:05:18.430> had<00:05:18.520> any<00:05:18.759> issues<00:05:19.000> with
