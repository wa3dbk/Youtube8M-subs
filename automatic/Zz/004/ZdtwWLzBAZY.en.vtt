00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.459
 hello friends in the next tutorial you 

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:05.459
 they can know how to make the beginning 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.730
 is one of my favorites the failure that 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.179
 they seemed to do you guys I'm going to divide it 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.900
 in three steps the first step consists of 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:27.900
 put the piece back 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.220
 and bend the knees 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.079
 the second step is to practice the 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.220
 trick movement 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.220
 in my case 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.060
 very well 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.380
 the time to act 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.400
 the scooter 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.400
 you have everything 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.870
 the 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.870
 for man 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.520
 You will see it below 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.620
 good there were recommendations to practice 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.250
 a lot of good stress just the movement 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.480
 as I said is like a term 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.480
 but it must be done on the euro 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:04.340
 over the shoulder 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.340
 good is quite complicated 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.780
 the time to leave jumping 4 2p back 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.090
 knees I want over the shoulder 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.350
 worry about being on one and 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.360
 jump on the scooter 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:27.840
 good if you liked the video click on 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:27.840
 the button I like facebook 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.620
 now 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.620
