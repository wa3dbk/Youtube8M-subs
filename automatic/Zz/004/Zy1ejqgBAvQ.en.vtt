00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.920
 propose to people find themselves on 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.380
 blackhawks 2 as usual is 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.210
 today a particular subject because 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.009
 that everyone is coming very 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.919
 quickly you can well imagine that 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:28.669
 that I'm talking about fifteen thousand subscribers and 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:30.619
 yes it happens very soon and a game 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.820
 I talk about this topic of a report 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.379
 what would you like me to do 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.790
 or what are you doing strong price 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.280
 because I do not have a lot of time 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.899
 let's say to do this but I'm talking to you 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.059
 of things that had to be done for his 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.250
 fifteen thousand subscribers there so I you 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.290
 talk about that right away went that time 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.110
 one thing that I plant fifa for 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.700
 the subscriber is episode 2 2 brief 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.660
 a regret on it so I would like that 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.910
 today 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.829
 you master all your questions by 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.700
 report to prefer on as on 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.820
 twitter that I took a risk 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.590
 usually here not in comment of 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.910
 So if this video on her breasts 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.260
 things that I believe he could lift 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.479
 between the cases for the caisses of 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.399
 the subscriber one option is that I think 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.590
 of what could be interesting this 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:11.450
 would be a priest for example but 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.180
 logical says I can yet to do 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.530
 this right now because of the market my 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.970

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.370

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.690

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:23.829

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.150
 on the dessert right now it burns 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.160
 still well thank you very much 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.260
 at mr jack kg theater like ten points 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.489
 the vi at war is stronger 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.440
 really a big difference 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.550
 before that ten athletes besides doing 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.760
 that dessert everyone I the 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.160
 successful was created the fucking fun of 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.470
 shit I was able a lot a lot of between 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.599
 you appreciate the videos that are not 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.799
 cut and what I think by that I 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.349
 think it's the simple reason it's 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.989
 because you like to see each other jim more 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.370
 never it's funny a gameplay of how 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.739
 I move that I play with 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.750
 the enemies as follows dictatorship etc 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.829
 I think and what I appreciate when you 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.349
 will see others are too busy 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.489
 precisely so what I say not so 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.959
 I thank you so I can in the 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.069
 campus videos like that because 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.799
 of course 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.970
 I love doing videos like I do not 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.680
 do not worry about them because it's 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.769
 lets talk about bigger topics 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.049
 and gives you really well explained in 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.510
 shorter pair of heels one way 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:38.269
 more hours more professional I would say 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:42.359
 500 go to the shit mayor 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:44.850
 ok ok it's still worth those good ones who 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:46.200
 it works the congress on Thursday 5 for 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.730
 me to say it like that I can 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.739
 ensure him choose the right words track 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.420
 wahab will have all the time to talk to me I 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.639
 take me some poses to explain to me 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.079
 what I mean what is true in 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.829
 more style but at the same time 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.690
 is not very dignified 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.760
 collectively, however, we avoid a 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.900
 drone fog shooter are at each 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.530
 objectively eight screws by the 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.389
 group scrambled 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.400
 aubry is both exposed to the 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:08.760
 party on big still very 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:13.500
 suitably read it also on behalf 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.940
 of god no to grace to a mother so 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.200
 that's what I think is precisely 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.940
 relation to those in relation to the fact you 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.310
 have surely jump list that I believe said 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:25.320
 is to go a third game on flickr and 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.610
 people when I think precisely this is 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.169
 videos or all that that and my 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.060
 goal will be useful to make the good 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.130
 gameplay so I really concentrated 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.539
 in this praise of more or less by the 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.940
 diets for the fair it's really 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:38.490
 just go play and just commented this 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.169
 that I do for example in part they 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.330
 saw me his voice only doing 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.280
 gameplay leaps gameplay Sunday 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.719
 their fauna looked I'm cold with a 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.280
 beautiful white marble music I think 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:48.680
 after 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.240
 very fun right so me too if 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:55.430
 you like to see that I think some 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:58.370
 very strong thing ok 48 hours for 15 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.930
 shares here it's still regretting 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.080
 well he must say it's a very good 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.910
 this part 41 useful to the deadmarsh team 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.010
 it's more than half the kills of 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.750
 the whole team so this is 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.669
 really well a very happy part 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.560
 have been part of the table on the good 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.110
 son he is shocking and symbol 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.210
 religious but it has more or less good 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.470
 market is no more serious than it takes 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.540
 so I recommend the video 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.000
 of today are going to be very very short 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:25.580
 I am aware of it but it is 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.140
 just because I'm not a video 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.240
 too long to really stay 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.280
 focused this topic of letting your 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.780
 questions to prefer on is 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.250
 really all that is online in the 15th 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.120
 subscribers so well I think it's 12 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.830
 more than in May 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.090
 and I tell you then precisely of 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.090
 this strange ciao
