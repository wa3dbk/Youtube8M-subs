00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.699 
okay so here's what's gonna happen when
you<00:03:23.190> use<00:03:23.220> it<00:03:23.670> on<00:03:23.820> dark<00:03:24.180> hair<00:03:24.450> but<00:03:25.110> this<00:03:25.290> is<00:03:25.470> fine

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
because it's not where a parting is

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.390
