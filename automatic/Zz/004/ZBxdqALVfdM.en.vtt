00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 everyone today we come for 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.830
 a little test video and first 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.720
 impressions 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.480
 because we discovered a little trick 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.349
 nice to make hairstyles that's it 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.349
 Yes 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.760
 so what is this discovery 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.680
 that's fine it's just 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.940
 twist babyliss website so yes 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.920
 First in was right in the heart if 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.240
 colette the one who made curls and 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.950
 now we have the right to twist 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.380
 silhouette is the device that makes 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.520
 twists and so with the most we have 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.870
 said that it would be a good idea to 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.430
 test because we like a lot 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.989
 it's the twists we find it very very 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.340
 very cute and then then also said 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.830
 that it would be super nice to make 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.840
 hairstyles for this summer so we are 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.309
 went to buy it at darty for those 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.540
 who would ask the question lies 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.949
 also online I would put you 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.290
 some addresses below the video 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.060
 the price I looked for now I 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.180
 seen everywhere at the same price ie 39 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.550
 90 euros and history to show you the 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.380
 simplicity of use which makes that 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.910
 really anyone can use this 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.630
 device we thought we were going to 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.600
 to make small rooftops huts 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.350
 were but how to present themselves 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.840
 the debt 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.790
 so here's what it looks like it's 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.210
 not necessarily very very big and imposing 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.680
 there are two small two little hooks 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.570
 in fact that serve to hang the 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.520
 locks of hair and then a button 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.550
 and when we push him up 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.910
 its going to turn the wicks of 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.470
 hair 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.990
 and when we see the master down 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.850
 attention it's surprising but it's me 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:34.369
 does not hurt it turns on itself for 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.810
 can do the famous dorsal so the 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.940
 concept is really very simple 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.560
 already existed when I was little to 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.330
 the dolls and we did it on us 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.039
 I already remember it worked 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.690
 already stack or not there in this case 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.360
 the batteries are included in the box so 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.550
 this very nice also thanks babyliss but 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.289
 here we are going to say that it was handed over to 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.119
 taste of the day so we can really 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.800
 use it on us it has a little bit 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.369
 beefier than his ancestors they 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.509
 were together all very small and 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.190
 Here we could not resist it was 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.080
 said we had to give him 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.250
 it's gone we try with you then 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.140
 to start once you have 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.770
 found the guinea pig you just have to have 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.599
 a brush of small elastics 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.280
 transparent and possibly a comb 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.849
 also can really very well 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.380
 unravel 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.360
 for starters I will already make you 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.170
 a simple demonstration 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.030
 not to mention hairstyle but just 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.830
 to show you how to 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.750
 operate the device so is the 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.750
 result that we get close very 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.180
 quickly so I take a strand of 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.310
 hair I mails I go to 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.670
 split into two parts the most equal 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.280
 possible I will come point this is the 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.890
 first wick in the small the little 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.520
 button makes it the second of the other 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.519
 side I'm careful that everything 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.319
 of course the same way and 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.150
 how to say here you understood 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.739
 like that 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:57.030
 then I put the button up 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:02.640
 and when it was pretty tight for my taste 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.030
 down I release the two small 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.000
 highlights 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.100
 I take a rubber band and that's my 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.569
 small twists and create very quickly 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.920
 so what are we going to do today 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.049
 it's trying to make small 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.090
 hairstyle prettier than just a small 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.280
 twists so for that I start with 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.709
 remove this one and we will make a 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.540
 braid cascades is what you know this 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.760
 that it's a braid cascades and the 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.040
 rediscover his 1,5 to make a truce 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:32.820
 waterfalls I'm going to take a wick 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:34.350
 on the side of the head game there it is by 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:44.820
 measure as I showed you 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:48.950
 just before I thought wick and I'm going 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:52.740
 well rolled a little bit like these 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:57.450
 then I'm going twists and two 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:04:03.390
 time and I'm going to come take some 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:06.060
 little wicks I'm going to spend in 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.570
 every little trick I would have done with 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.570
 the machine 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.870
 like this one 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:33.190
 So here is the commune on 

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:34.389
 hair that are relatively short I 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.490
 will not be able to go to 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.720
 the other side of the head with the hair 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.449
 longer you can finish it on 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.490
 the completely opposite side then 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:47.199
 once I got there I'm going 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:49.030
 just go back a little bit and I 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.280
 go fix the end with a small 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.930
 elastic 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.039
 I then do the same thing of the other 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.120
 side I play one the two small wicks 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:59.590
 together so here I remember that we have 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.789
 relatively short hair with 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.849
 cabbage is much longer that could 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:06.909
 even be finished in twists with the 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:09.129
 rest of the two wicks and then hop 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:12.819
 we have a small press 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:14.379
 waterfalls all along the head I pass 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:15.789
 then to a much more hairstyle 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:17.139
 simple but very effective 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.940
 also it's about making three 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:22.469
 small hours room i'm going to start 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.469
 by the one above 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:50.510
 Then I take a second bit in 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.510
 below and I'm going to do the same thing 

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:08.300
 and I'm going to take a bit more 

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:08.300
 down and do exactly the same thing 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:16.169
 once I have my three little ones 

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:18.689
 Corsican wicks said I'm going to them 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:21.139
 gather and using a small 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:21.139
 pliers 

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:25.559
 I'm going to hang them together and 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:27.509
 here 

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:28.679
 and so that's for these little huts at 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:31.589
 hairdresser as you will have seen 

00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:33.479
 it's very fast very simple and especially 

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:35.249
 we have relatively short hair 

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:36.269
 with the chip but with the hair 

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:37.860
 much longer I think there is 

00:06:36.269 --> 00:06:40.229
 really mean with a little word 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.959
 of imagination to make full full 

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:44.429
 hairdresser super nice and like you 

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:46.709
 could see it really very very 

00:06:44.429 --> 00:06:48.149
 easily it's true that even very 

00:06:46.709 --> 00:06:50.189
 girl I think can use 

00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:51.539
 all alone maybe because you 

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:56.459
 would you happen to think they would arrive 

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:59.479
 all alone thinks only from 8 9 10 

00:06:56.459 --> 00:07:02.009
 years we may have arrived 3 2 

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:04.139
 So here on this I hope this 

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:04.979
 little demonstration and it's small tutorial 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:06.719
 you will have more 

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:08.159
 and then error in the next video 

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:11.929
 we send you lots of big kisses 

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:11.929
 and we say to you very soon 

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.360

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.410
 but our values
