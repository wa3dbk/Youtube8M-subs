00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.360
 as we all know we always have that 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.790
 try to change our routine 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.100
 training every six weeks of this 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.080
 way we can keep moving forward and 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.119
 this way we can avoid getting stuck 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.329
 because we give a different stimulus to the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.500
 muscle you agree with me truth 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:23.130
 Well, you do not have to agree 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.169
 with me 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.090
 simply because this is a myth and it is 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.470
 one of the most common mistakes that 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.840
 they produce when we train in the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.060
 gym let's say that in the world of 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.100
 training in the gym world 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.600
 in the world of work with weights and in 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.910
 definitive in all this world 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.100
 we have two very opposite poles and very 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.600
 well differentiated on the one hand we have 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.730
 those coaches and those 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.140
 people who always do the same thing is 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.840
 say they always do the same routine 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.460
 always the same exercises same 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.650
 volume same frequency same 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.480
 intensity and in short they are always going to 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.370
 get the same thing because if you always 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.050
 you do the same thing you will always get the 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.690
 same results usually is usually 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.940
 nothing and on the other hand we have just 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.530
 the opposite and it's coaches and 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.770
 people who are obsessed with 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.990
 change your training routine 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.060
 today I'm mainly going to focus on 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.399
 this group and is that many of you 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.990
 you will ask, but how often do I have 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.420
 to change my training routine 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.130
 it is advisable to change my routine 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.840
 training frequently for 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.069
 this way I do not adapt and I can continue 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.280
 making progress 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:26.810
 the answer is flatly you do not have 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.909
 to change our routine 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.399
 training often think 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.869
 because whenever we start a routine 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.549
 of training we need 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.920
 necessarily a period of 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.719
 adaptation that means we have a 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.819
 determined volume we have a 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.799
 Frequency determined some exercises 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:45.140
 that we normally can or can not 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.970
 have done and ultimately are a 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.549
 set of factors that until now is 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.020
 possible that we have not covered what is 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.399
 what happens then that the first week 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.829
 obviously we are going to find 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.810
 pretty bad is a volume that maybe not 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:59.119
 tolerate is a frequency with which 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.920
 we are not used are exercises 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.569
 that we have never practiced and in 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.030
 definitively we will not be able to squeeze 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.709
 our maximum potential is to say that no 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.079
 we will be able to train like really 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:11.060
 we should train the first week 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:12.920
 we will have many laces 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.530
 and the second week we will also have 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.260
 a lot of laces in the third week 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.610
 we will start to find ourselves comfortable with 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.590
 this volume of training and with 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.050
 our exercises to the fourth week 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.209
 we will have automated the technique with 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.040
 these exercises and surely to the 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.989
 fifth or the sixth week we are already 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.910
 ready to really work 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.470
 with a high intensity that is to say that 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.840
 really be prepared for 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.519
 take advantage of these exercises but 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.530
 what is happening then that then 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.030
 our coach arrives and tells us that 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.319
 we have to change the routine of 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.750
 training because we have already 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.250
 adapted to this one but good if it is that it is 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.560
 now the moment in which we 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.330
 we have to work with intensity is 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.380
 the moment in which we are prepared 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.450
 to increase the volume of 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.040
 training is the moment by which 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.840
 we can increase the frequency of 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.880
 training and above all is that already 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.370
 we have automated the technique in these 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.590
 exercises and that's when we're really going to 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.239
 to take advantage of it, we will be able to 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.519
 recruit all our fibers to the maximum 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.200
 muscles we will be able to work with a 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.209
 weight that is according to what we 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.739
 we can lift and above all is that what 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.019
 we will be able to safely 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.900
 then because I have to change my 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.180
 training routine 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.610
 if we look and analyze all this 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.290
 process we can see that not even 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.870
 a week we have trained with our 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.489
 maximum potential we have trained 4 or 5 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.260
 weeks but we really have not 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.360
 harnessed all the work we had 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.370
 that have taken advantage and that is what 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.069
 basically it happens that this loop 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.890
 it is repeated indefinitely 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.510
 we work between 4 or 5 weeks we 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.519
 we adapt and we are prepared to 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.189
 to be able to increase the weight and be able to work with 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.230
 security and then we change again 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:49.359
 our routine we start again to 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.769
 find us uncomfortable if that is true 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.810
 that we are very motivated because we have 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.489
 changed but we do not tolerate well the 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.560
 training volume we do not know 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.239
 well the technique of those exercises the 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.129
 frequency is a frequency that still 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.550
 we do not admit and ultimately what 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:05.220
 it happens is that we spend years 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.040
 and years without having any kind of 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.230
 result but it's very simple and that is 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.910
 we have not worked even four 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.770
 weeks in all these years with the 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.830
 maximum potential with which we 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.570
 we would have to work 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.920
 it's a real problem and it's what 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.720
 I want to criticize in this video 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.570
 you will wonder what it is that we 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.400
 advise this david well I advise you 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.770
 that you always work with the same 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.840
 same exercise routine until it 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.300
 truth that is the whole party that 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.100
 you have to get that routine 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.810
 of course I do not want to say that 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.270
 always do the same thing is to say 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.960
 we will have to increase the volume 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.850
 We will have to increase the 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.800
 intensity we would have to go doing 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.960
 various progressions to be able to follow 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.810
 improving we can add exercises 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.580
 accessories and we definitely have to 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.590
 differentiate perfectly and we have to 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.500
 mentalize us very well that is not what 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.900
 same progress and increase various 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.600
 variables that change it absolutely 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.520
 all without any kind of purpose in a way 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.560
 we will be able to progress and the other 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.300
 way we're just going to go into a 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.910
 loop which we will not get 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.470
 no result and honestly this is 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.300
 what usually happens and is that we 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.400
 we found people who carry 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.500
 training five or six years and really 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.570
 they are exactly the same as the 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.760
 first and that is that not even during 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.070
 four weeks have managed to train 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.139
 with its maximum power and this for 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.699
 course if you do not get hurt 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:28.770
 If you do not know the technique of a 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:30.090
 exercise and you're not used to the 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.580
 finished volume and a certain 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:35.069
 intensity surely you also have 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.229
 more possibility of injury so nothing 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:38.939
 If you liked this reflection, do you think 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:41.340
 that is going to help you or has simply 

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:43.110
 made understand other points of view 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.819
 give him a little hand above subscribe to 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.710
 this channel to give support and follow 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:50.150
 growing a big hug and see you 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.150
 in the following videos thank you very much
