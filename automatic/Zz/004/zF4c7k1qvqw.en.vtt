00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
and it looks really weird because you

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.300 
and it looks really weird because you
actually<00:01:10.170> be<00:01:10.409> holding<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.950> during<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
actually be holding it during the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.700 
actually be holding it during the
animation<00:01:11.689> the<00:01:12.689> funny<00:01:12.960> thing<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.229> when<00:01:13.560> you

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
animation the funny thing is when you

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.170 
animation the funny thing is when you
shoot<00:01:14.040> you'll<00:01:14.280> actually<00:01:14.490> be<00:01:14.700> shooting

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
shoot you'll actually be shooting

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.030 
shoot you'll actually be shooting
forward<00:01:15.630> like<00:01:15.810> wherever<00:01:16.049> your<00:01:16.409> crosshair<00:01:17.009> is

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
forward like wherever your crosshair is

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.190 
forward like wherever your crosshair is
but<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.820> gun<00:01:18.090> will<00:01:18.210> actually<00:01:18.570> be<00:01:18.810> firing

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
but the gun will actually be firing

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.840 
but the gun will actually be firing
straight<00:01:19.619> up<00:01:19.860> into<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.159> air<00:01:20.280> whichever

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
straight up into the air whichever

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.340 
straight up into the air whichever
direction<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.570> pointing<00:01:22.080> when<00:01:22.229> you're

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
direction it is pointing when you're

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.230 
direction it is pointing when you're
holding<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:22.890> your<00:01:23.009> hand<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:24.060> only

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
holding it in your hand the only

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.120 
holding it in your hand the only
downside<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:24.990> once<00:01:25.530> you've<00:01:25.740> done<00:01:25.979> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
downside to this is once you've done the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.039 
downside to this is once you've done the
glitch<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.640> cannot<00:01:26.939> do<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.299> again<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:27.840> if<00:01:27.960> you

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
glitch you cannot do it again so if you

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.109 
glitch you cannot do it again so if you
