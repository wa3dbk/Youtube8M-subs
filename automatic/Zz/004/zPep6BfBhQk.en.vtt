00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.750
 hi everyone as you know 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.670
 battlefield cat and already felt since 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.470
 a few days and I'm sure 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.570
 some of you are wondering but 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.280
 where and evolution on some maps 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.750
 that's why I wish you the 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.150
 welcome to this recap 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.250
 concerning the evolution on all 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.250
 basic maps 2 battlefield 4 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.029
 she and we'll start voting 311 or the goal 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.920
 is going to be dropping this tower and 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.750
 for that we will have to activate an account 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.430
 Countdown which is in Building 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.430
 from the point it is in conquest 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.090
 three minutes after turning on the 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.129
 countdown an explosion will make 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.809
 fall the tower on the roof of the building 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.160
 know also for the most meticulous 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.780
 of you that you can close the 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.910
 train wagon doors for you 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:50.769
 hide or even to take your 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:52.690
 adversaries we now move on 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.729
 dam of lancang and on this map 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.170
 it's like his name indicates a dam 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:58.449
 we're going to have to destroy using 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.280
 attacked helicopters like the voc or 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.110
 well using rocket launches 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.940
 note that the dam is resistant and 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.860
 that it must be attacked mainly 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.130
 lower part of it for the 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.130
 destroy 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.590
 you've all recognized a seizure of 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.570
 seats offer a gain and for those who 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.310
 would not know it yet evolution 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.380
 The main purpose of this card is to 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.180
 collapse the central building into 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.970
 destroying the top of the four pillars of 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.860
 always before for the most careful 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.420
 it is possible to lower grid for 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.700
 protect yourself at the point of the point it's 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.530
 as well as blocking the road to vehicles 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.530
 adversaries using terminals on the bridge 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.770
 on the hackers transmission side had 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.899
 the possibility of dropping the antenna 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.969
 radio that is at the center of the map for 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.560
 do you have explosive for 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:50.600
 break the vaults returning the pillars 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.130
 attached to the antenna I take this opportunity to 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.939
 add that this map is taken from a 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.649
 james bond movie 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.649
 a nice wink from dice 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.899
 surpass the storm the evolution is a 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.340
 little more complex indeed more 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.840
 of the storm that happens once the 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.579
 team tickets arrives at half 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.950
 it is possible to defeat a 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.690
 liner on the shore for that he 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.099
 just wait for a lightning strike 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.260
 the wind turbine that keeps the liner 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.120
 close to greetings then you just need to 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.540
 draw some queries on it for the 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.310
 destroy 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.690
 this one will just released the 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.959
 ship that ran aground on the shore of 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.060
 face 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.440
 note that it is also possible to climb 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.440
 above once they were played 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.350
 on the same principle as dam of 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.090
 the auction the evolution of the vague foods 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.890
 zone is to destroy a dam at 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.960
 using tanks or explosives so 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.490
 to flood a big part of the map this 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.150
 who will help it benefit to the vehicles 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.220
 naval note that the balance being flooded 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.960
 the infantry will be forced to fight 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.520
 mostly on the roofs which 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.520
 will make the gameplay more dynamic 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.799
 the evolution of the map of a robber 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.200
 activate by creating a gas flow 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:03.170
 via the opening of two valves located 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.670
 at the ends of the road shortly after 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.860
 activation of it you will see 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.900
 a gigantic explosion through 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.790
 the whole road and destroying the bridge at 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.470
 passage gum train one stands out 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.659
 other maps since here there is nothing 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.730
 activate or indeed destroy once 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:20.989
 point d on the captured train 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.549
 by one of the two teams 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.900
 the front gear will be all by itself which 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.209
 will give a point constantly in 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.829
 move the battles into vehicles 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.829
 will therefore be privileged to capture him 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.440
 let's move on to a gene resort where the goal is going 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.329
 to be a little bit like seating 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.639
 of shanghai to bring down the parties 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.139
 left and right of the altar for that 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.250
 destroy and the outer walls that 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:45.549
 support the building using 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.549
 explosives 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.879
 this will block access 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.439
 at the point by the sides and so of the 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:56.389
 protect more easily and finish 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:58.669
 with operation locker where evolution 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:00.769
 main thing is to destroy a tower 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:03.699
 by exploding the base of this one 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.699
 located in the basement 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.670
 you may have seen it in the 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.800
 thrillers 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.110
 we also have the opportunity to cut the 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.940
 running in the basement to get shot 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.230
 on the blinking red generator this 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.459
 will only last a few seconds 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.989
 what to take the advent on your 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.760
 adversaries little personal trick he 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.440
 is possible to create a path in 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.240
 destroying the walls next to the entrance 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.860
 towards point b this trick can be 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.890
 terribly effective when your 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.450
 enemies are waiting behind the door 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.100
 and that's the end of this recap 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.710
 I hope you have some more 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.480
 i want to thank the bf community 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.980
 one for his great participation 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.170
 we will meet at the latest for 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.680
 recap of the next pack 2 vf 4 10 he has 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.680
 play well
