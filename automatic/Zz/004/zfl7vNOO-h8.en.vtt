at<00:02:42.720> an<00:02:42.870> instant<00:02:43.320> when<00:02:44.070> it's<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.400> bit<00:02:44.580> warm<00:02:45.590> the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
at an instant when it's a bit warm the

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.440 
at an instant when it's a bit warm the

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
heatsink doesn t be clean of course I'm

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.210 
heatsink doesn t be clean of course I'm
not<00:02:48.570> really<00:02:48.750> sure<00:02:48.930> how<00:02:49.080> to<00:02:49.110> do<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.410> so<00:02:51.140> I'm

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
not really sure how to do it so I'm

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.790 
not really sure how to do it so I'm
probably<00:02:53.220> gonna<00:02:53.400> leave<00:02:53.490> it<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.640> someone<00:02:53.970> else

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
probably gonna leave it to someone else

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.290 
probably gonna leave it to someone else
all<00:02:55.800> right<00:02:55.980> let's<00:02:56.130> see<00:02:56.280> you<00:02:56.520> know<00:02:56.640> it's<00:02:57.120> gonna

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
all right let's see you know it's gonna

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.910 
all right let's see you know it's gonna
take<00:02:57.570> a<00:02:57.600> couple<00:02:57.690> minutes<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:58.230> I'll<00:02:58.530> pause<00:02:58.770> it

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
take a couple minutes so I'll pause it

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.710 
take a couple minutes so I'll pause it
until<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.600> screen<00:03:00.600> is<00:03:00.750> until<00:03:01.440> it's<00:03:01.560> done

want to do but most likely recovery RSA
blocks<00:04:05.130> all<00:04:05.400> portions<00:04:05.790> will<00:04:05.910> be<00:04:06.060> lead<00:04:06.209> yep

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
blocks all portions will be lead yep

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.970 
blocks all portions will be lead yep
okay

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.860 

so<00:04:13.550> yeah<00:04:13.760> let's<00:04:14.060> take<00:04:14.209> another<00:04:14.360> couple

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
so yeah let's take another couple

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.409 
so yeah let's take another couple
minutes<00:04:15.230> I<00:04:15.349> guess<00:04:15.530> and<00:04:17.049> yep<00:04:18.049> still<00:04:18.440> preparing

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
minutes I guess and yep still preparing

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.670 
minutes I guess and yep still preparing
partition<00:04:20.419> so<00:04:20.720> you<00:04:20.930> gotta<00:04:21.109> wait<00:04:21.290> a<00:04:21.350> couple

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
partition so you gotta wait a couple

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.450 
partition so you gotta wait a couple
minutes<00:04:22.780> happens<00:04:23.780> every<00:04:23.990> time<00:04:24.370> pretty<00:04:25.370> much

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
minutes happens every time pretty much

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.290 
minutes happens every time pretty much
same<00:04:26.030> thing<00:04:26.210> every<00:04:26.480> computer<00:04:26.870> and<00:04:28.000> so<00:04:29.000> here<00:04:29.180> we

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
same thing every computer and so here we

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.290 
same thing every computer and so here we
are<00:04:29.389> still<00:04:29.690> at<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:30.010> recovery<00:04:31.010> or<00:04:31.790> the

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
are still at the recovery or the

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.860 
are still at the recovery or the
repairing<00:04:33.260> menu<00:04:34.190> it<00:04:34.760> take<00:04:35.000> about<00:04:35.210> say<00:04:35.570> five

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
repairing menu it take about say five

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:36.969 
repairing menu it take about say five
minutes<00:04:35.900> it's<00:04:36.229> been<00:04:36.380> five<00:04:36.620> minutes<00:04:36.889> already

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
minutes it's been five minutes already

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:42.550 
minutes it's been five minutes already
so<00:04:37.280> I<00:04:37.550> don't<00:04:37.639> know<00:04:37.940> it<00:04:38.750> takes<00:04:39.050> time<00:04:40.990> all<00:04:41.990> right

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
so I don't know it takes time all right

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.700 
so I don't know it takes time all right
so<00:04:42.800> that's<00:04:43.040> been<00:04:43.220> a<00:04:43.250> nice<00:04:43.700> long<00:04:44.210> five<00:04:45.050> to<00:04:45.440> ten

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
so that's been a nice long five to ten

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:46.719 
so that's been a nice long five to ten
minutes<00:04:46.070> wait

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
minutes wait

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:48.790 
minutes wait
now<00:04:47.570> it's<00:04:47.720> repairing<00:04:48.080> it's<00:04:48.260> copying<00:04:48.590> files

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800
