may want this week if you have a smaller
head<00:03:29.310> I'm<00:03:29.850> I<00:03:29.910> think<00:03:30.330> that<00:03:30.540> it<00:03:30.720> would<00:03:30.810> fit<00:03:31.050> you<00:03:31.170> I

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
head I'm I think that it would fit you I

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.960 
head I'm I think that it would fit you I
would<00:03:31.470> definitely<00:03:31.620> say<00:03:32.070> give<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.490> try<00:03:32.520> it's

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
would definitely say give it a try it's

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.880 
would definitely say give it a try it's
like<00:03:33.150> such<00:03:33.450> an<00:03:33.600> affordable<00:03:33.870> reasonable<00:03:34.620> price

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
like such an affordable reasonable price

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.460 
like such an affordable reasonable price
and<00:03:35.190> it<00:03:36.180> does<00:03:36.360> not<00:03:36.510> say<00:03:36.750> on<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:36.960> package<00:03:36.990> if

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
and it does not say on the package if

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.050 
and it does not say on the package if
you<00:03:37.590> can<00:03:37.740> play<00:03:37.920> heat<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.400> it<00:03:38.550> or<00:03:38.640> not<00:03:38.820> but<00:03:39.030> I

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
you can play heat to it or not but I

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.390 
you can play heat to it or not but I
really<00:03:39.450> do<00:03:39.630> believe<00:03:39.810> you<00:03:40.170> can<00:03:40.470> because<00:03:41.190> it

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
really do believe you can because it

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.390 
really do believe you can because it
says<00:03:41.640> it's<00:03:41.850> 100%<00:03:42.720> human<00:03:43.050> hair<00:03:43.110> mix<00:03:43.680> so<00:03:44.190> there

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
says it's 100% human hair mix so there

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.310 
says it's 100% human hair mix so there
is<00:03:44.610> some<00:03:44.850> human<00:03:45.180> hair<00:03:45.360> throughout<00:03:45.780> it<00:03:45.990> so<00:03:46.170> I'm

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
is some human hair throughout it so I'm

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.750 
is some human hair throughout it so I'm
pretty<00:03:46.590> sure<00:03:46.890> that<00:03:47.070> you<00:03:47.190> could<00:03:47.310> probably<00:03:47.460> put

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
pretty sure that you could probably put

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.120 
pretty sure that you could probably put
heat<00:03:47.940> to<00:03:47.970> it<00:03:48.270> but<00:03:48.750> if<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.170> do<00:03:49.470> I<00:03:49.500> would<00:03:49.770> suggest

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
heat to it but if you do I would suggest

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.040 
heat to it but if you do I would suggest
that<00:03:50.400> you<00:03:50.490> keep<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:50.910> at<00:03:51.030> a<00:03:51.060> low<00:03:51.150> setting<00:03:51.720> no

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
that you keep it at a low setting no

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.530 
that you keep it at a low setting no
more<00:03:52.290> than<00:03:52.500> 300<00:03:52.740> degrees<00:03:53.280> anything<00:03:54.270> above
