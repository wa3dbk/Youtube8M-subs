00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.360 

actually<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.179> fact<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.630> I'm<00:00:10.099> looking<00:00:11.099> a

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
actually the fact that I'm looking a

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.830 
actually the fact that I'm looking a
little<00:00:11.610> different<00:00:12.030> on<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.240> game<00:00:12.450> than<00:00:12.719> they

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
little different on the game than they

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.200 
little different on the game than they
are<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:13.259> think<00:00:13.530> sometimes<00:00:14.340> people<00:00:14.670> get<00:00:15.150> a

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
are I think sometimes people get a

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.660 
are I think sometimes people get a
little<00:00:15.389> stuck<00:00:15.870> in<00:00:16.049> their<00:00:16.199> mindset<00:00:16.670> they've

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
little stuck in their mindset they've

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.090 
little stuck in their mindset they've
seen<00:00:18.000> things<00:00:18.420> been<00:00:18.750> working<00:00:19.170> for<00:00:19.470> for<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:19.980> lot

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
seen things been working for for a lot

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.029 
seen things been working for for a lot
of<00:00:20.250> years<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:21.230> that<00:00:22.230> doesn't<00:00:22.650> necessarily

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
of years and that doesn't necessarily

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.410 
of years and that doesn't necessarily
mean<00:00:23.550> it's<00:00:23.789> right<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.330> mean<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.439> think<00:00:26.420> some

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
mean it's right I mean and I think some

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.429 
mean it's right I mean and I think some
of<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.660> players<00:00:27.900> are<00:00:28.170> little<00:00:29.840> they<00:00:30.840> they<00:00:31.199> just

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
of the players are little they they just

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.200 
of the players are little they they just
go<00:00:31.590> go<00:00:32.160> with<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.399> flow<00:00:32.610> they<00:00:32.850> play<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.180> same

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
go go with the flow they play the same

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.170 
go go with the flow they play the same
style<00:00:33.750> even<00:00:34.260> though<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.860> game<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.730> poker<00:00:35.940> has

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
style even though the game of poker has

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.150 
style even though the game of poker has
actually<00:00:36.660> changed<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:37.559> last<00:00:37.770> couple<00:00:38.100> of

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
actually changed the last couple of

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.060 
actually changed the last couple of
years<00:00:38.340> with<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.660> kind<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.840> new<00:00:40.050> modern<00:00:40.680> style

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
years with a kind of a new modern style

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.950 
years with a kind of a new modern style
playing<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.730> lot<00:00:41.879> more<00:00:42.090> hand<00:00:42.360> seeing<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.809> lot

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
playing a lot more hand seeing a lot

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.200 
playing a lot more hand seeing a lot
more<00:00:42.989> flops<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.070> I'm<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.700> think<00:00:44.789> I'm<00:00:45.149> very

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
more flops and and I'm I think I'm very

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.170 
more flops and and I'm I think I'm very
good<00:00:45.600> at<00:00:45.980> seeing<00:00:46.980> things<00:00:47.850> from<00:00:48.149> different

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
good at seeing things from different

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.350 
good at seeing things from different
points<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.020> view<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.680> then<00:00:50.070> change<00:00:50.460> for

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
points of view and and then change for

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.029 
points of view and and then change for
what<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.629> right<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:52.020> different<00:00:52.350> situations<00:00:52.980> so

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
what is right in different situations so

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.270 
what is right in different situations so
I<00:00:53.370> like<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.149> look<00:00:54.690> very<00:00:54.719> objectively<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.890> it

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
I like to look very objectively and it

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.189 
I like to look very objectively and it
might<00:00:56.460> be<00:00:56.640> right<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:56.879> one<00:00:57.149> situation<00:00:57.390> but<00:00:57.870> it's

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
might be right in one situation but it's

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.470 
might be right in one situation but it's
not<00:00:58.440> always<00:00:58.829> right<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.399> that's<00:00:59.670> I<00:01:00.120> mean

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
not always right and that's I mean

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.750 
not always right and that's I mean
that's<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.899> interesting<00:01:01.170> thing<00:01:01.620> about<00:01:02.100> poker

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
that's the interesting thing about poker

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.910 
that's the interesting thing about poker
I<00:01:02.910> mean<00:01:03.180> there's<00:01:03.420> different<00:01:04.110> answers<00:01:04.530> all<00:01:04.769> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
I mean there's different answers all the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.120 
I mean there's different answers all the
time<00:01:05.129> depending<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:06.270> like<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.080> said<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
time depending on like you said the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.210 
time depending on like you said the
players<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:09.119> size<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.020> chips<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.920> so

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
players the size of the chips and and so

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:23.190 
players the size of the chips and and so
on

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.910 

I<00:01:23.430> also<00:01:24.430> have<00:01:24.820> a<00:01:24.850> very<00:01:25.360> mathematical<00:01:25.930> point<00:01:26.710> of

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
I also have a very mathematical point of

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.950 
I also have a very mathematical point of
view<00:01:27.280> and<00:01:28.000> that<00:01:28.509> is<00:01:28.719> like<00:01:29.320> in<00:01:30.000> Hold'em<00:01:31.000> you

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
view and that is like in Hold'em you

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.929 
view and that is like in Hold'em you
have<00:01:32.170> five<00:01:32.500> cards<00:01:32.860> down<00:01:33.039> and<00:01:33.340> two<00:01:33.520> cards<00:01:33.820> in

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
have five cards down and two cards in

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.450 
have five cards down and two cards in
your<00:01:34.000> hand<00:01:34.390> which<00:01:34.960> is<00:01:35.170> a<00:01:35.200> total<00:01:35.649> of<00:01:35.740> seven

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
your hand which is a total of seven

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.169 
your hand which is a total of seven
cards<00:01:36.909> and<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:38.560> three<00:01:38.799> cards<00:01:39.130> on<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.399> flop<00:01:39.670> is

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
cards and the three cards on the flop is

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:44.580 
cards and the three cards on the flop is
actually<00:01:41.100> 43%<00:01:42.100> of<00:01:42.220> your<00:01:42.399> seven<00:01:42.970> card<00:01:43.270> hand<00:01:43.600> so

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
actually 43% of your seven card hand so

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.249 
actually 43% of your seven card hand so
I<00:01:44.920> mean<00:01:45.250> you<00:01:46.000> should<00:01:46.240> actually<00:01:46.479> see<00:01:46.780> a<00:01:46.960> lot<00:01:47.200> of

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
I mean you should actually see a lot of

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.260 
I mean you should actually see a lot of
flop<00:01:47.619> because<00:01:48.100> it's<00:01:48.310> such<00:01:48.520> a<00:01:48.549> big<00:01:48.880> part<00:01:49.179> of

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
flop because it's such a big part of

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.359 
flop because it's such a big part of
your<00:01:49.420> hand<00:01:49.659> of<00:01:50.289> course<00:01:50.590> you<00:01:50.740> need<00:01:50.890> to<00:01:51.100> start

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
your hand of course you need to start

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.219 
your hand of course you need to start
with<00:01:51.640> a<00:01:52.229> playable<00:01:53.229> hand<00:01:53.560> but<00:01:54.039> I<00:01:54.640> mean<00:01:55.179> the<00:01:55.959> flop

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
with a playable hand but I mean the flop

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.949 
with a playable hand but I mean the flop
is<00:01:56.470> just<00:01:56.740> a<00:01:56.890> key<00:01:57.220> to<00:01:57.909> every<00:01:58.209> hand<00:01:58.450> even<00:01:58.840> though

00:01:58.949 --> 00:01:58.959 
is just a key to every hand even though

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:00.300 
is just a key to every hand even though
you<00:01:59.020> started<00:01:59.409> with<00:01:59.500> a<00:01:59.530> great<00:01:59.770> hand<00:02:00.039> if<00:02:00.220> it

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
you started with a great hand if it

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.580 
you started with a great hand if it
doesn't<00:02:00.640> match<00:02:00.789> the<00:02:01.060> flop<00:02:01.329> you're<00:02:01.659> usually

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
doesn't match the flop you're usually

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.520 
doesn't match the flop you're usually
out<00:02:02.860> of<00:02:03.009> there<00:02:03.310> so<00:02:04.140> that's<00:02:05.140> kind<00:02:05.409> of<00:02:05.470> my

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
out of there so that's kind of my

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:18.140 
out of there so that's kind of my
philosophy<00:02:06.250> on<00:02:06.280> that

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.610 

sometimes<00:02:19.370> my<00:02:20.370> my<00:02:20.760> ego<00:02:21.180> plays<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:21.989> little<00:02:22.379> trick

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
sometimes my my ego plays a little trick

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.449 
sometimes my my ego plays a little trick
on<00:02:22.769> me<00:02:23.010> because<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:24.330> mean<00:02:24.720> when<00:02:25.440> it's<00:02:26.129> it's

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
on me because I I mean when it's it's

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.610 
on me because I I mean when it's it's
not<00:02:26.670> fun<00:02:26.940> leaving<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.510> table<00:02:27.690> as<00:02:27.959> a<00:02:27.989> loser<00:02:28.290> and

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
not fun leaving the table as a loser and

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.040 
not fun leaving the table as a loser and
I<00:02:28.769> kind<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.459> sometimes<00:02:29.670> stick<00:02:30.569> around<00:02:30.660> too

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
I kind of sometimes stick around too

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.369 
I kind of sometimes stick around too
long<00:02:31.550> playing<00:02:32.550> in<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.330> maybe<00:02:33.629> not<00:02:33.840> that

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
hands it kind of messes it a little bit

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.690 
hands it kind of messes it a little bit
with<00:02:54.030> your<00:02:54.150> mind<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:54.750> actually<00:02:55.709> that<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.459> best

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
with your mind so actually that the best

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.780 
with your mind so actually that the best
approaches<00:02:57.360> is<00:02:57.599> really<00:02:58.110> to<00:02:58.290> play<00:02:58.470> like<00:02:59.160> short

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
approaches is really to play like short

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.729 
approaches is really to play like short
sessions<00:03:00.360> when<00:03:00.569> you're<00:03:00.750> losing<00:03:01.230> because<00:03:01.440> you

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
sessions when you're losing because you

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.930 
sessions when you're losing because you
might<00:03:01.950> not<00:03:02.760> be<00:03:02.970> in<00:03:03.150> in<00:03:03.799> top<00:03:04.799> shape<00:03:04.829> of<00:03:05.459> you

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
might not be in in top shape of you

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.030 
might not be in in top shape of you
might<00:03:06.120> not<00:03:06.360> be<00:03:06.750> thinking<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.260> right<00:03:07.440> way<00:03:07.500> and

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
might not be thinking the right way and

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.630 
might not be thinking the right way and
and<00:03:09.319> so<00:03:10.319> short<00:03:10.709> sessions<00:03:11.160> when<00:03:11.310> you're<00:03:11.459> losing

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
and so short sessions when you're losing

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.550 
and so short sessions when you're losing
and<00:03:12.090> long<00:03:12.599> sessions<00:03:13.019> when<00:03:13.230> you're<00:03:13.379> winning

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
and long sessions when you're winning

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.319 
and long sessions when you're winning
because<00:03:14.010> usually<00:03:14.190> when<00:03:14.610> you're<00:03:14.760> winning<00:03:14.940> the

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
because usually when you're winning the

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.300 
because usually when you're winning the
other<00:03:15.450> guys<00:03:15.660> are<00:03:15.870> losing<00:03:16.079> and<00:03:16.890> you<00:03:17.010> want<00:03:17.220> to

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
other guys are losing and you want to

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.610 
other guys are losing and you want to
keep<00:03:17.700> continue<00:03:18.209> playing<00:03:18.450> they<00:03:19.079> might<00:03:19.290> not<00:03:19.440> be

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
keep continue playing they might not be

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.190 
keep continue playing they might not be
on<00:03:19.739> top<00:03:19.950> of<00:03:20.099> their<00:03:20.220> game<00:03:20.250> so<00:03:20.720> I'm<00:03:21.720> definitely

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
on top of their game so I'm definitely

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.470 
on top of their game so I'm definitely
improving<00:03:23.160> my<00:03:23.489> my<00:03:24.420> my<00:03:25.100> mental<00:03:26.269> attitude<00:03:27.269> when

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
improving my my my mental attitude when

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.330 
improving my my my mental attitude when
I'm<00:03:27.600> losing<00:03:28.049> but<00:03:28.260> I<00:03:28.290> still<00:03:28.769> have<00:03:28.950> some<00:03:29.130> work<00:03:29.310> to

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
I'm losing but I still have some work to

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:39.900 
I'm losing but I still have some work to
do

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.730 

I<00:03:39.940> think<00:03:40.720> people<00:03:40.990> in<00:03:41.170> general<00:03:41.410> and

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
I think people in general and

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.460 
I think people in general and
tournaments<00:03:42.190> are<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.310> little<00:03:42.460> bit<00:03:42.670> too<00:03:42.880> afraid

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
tournaments are a little bit too afraid

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.250 
tournaments are a little bit too afraid
people<00:03:44.470> have<00:03:44.620> that<00:03:44.800> philosophy<00:03:45.310> well<00:03:46.110> this<00:03:47.110> is

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
people have that philosophy well this is

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.740 
people have that philosophy well this is
all<00:03:47.410> I<00:03:47.440> had<00:03:47.770> I<00:03:47.800> can't<00:03:48.280> I<00:03:48.550> can't<00:03:49.090> buy<00:03:49.270> in<00:03:49.480> anymore

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
all I had I can't I can't buy in anymore

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.900 
all I had I can't I can't buy in anymore
and<00:03:50.350> they<00:03:50.470> get<00:03:50.860> a<00:03:50.890> little<00:03:51.070> bit<00:03:51.310> too<00:03:51.490> timid

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
and they get a little bit too timid

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.730 
and they get a little bit too timid
we're<00:03:52.480> in<00:03:52.600> live<00:03:52.780> games<00:03:53.050> you<00:03:53.170> can<00:03:53.290> always<00:03:53.560> buy

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
we're in live games you can always buy

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.090 
we're in live games you can always buy
in<00:03:53.950> for<00:03:54.190> more<00:03:54.480> so<00:03:55.480> so<00:03:55.960> in<00:03:56.080> tournaments<00:03:56.650> they

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
in for more so so in tournaments they

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.880 
in for more so so in tournaments they
they<00:03:58.090> think<00:03:58.150> about<00:03:58.630> too<00:03:59.140> much<00:03:59.320> about<00:03:59.380> their

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
they think about too much about their

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.160 
they think about too much about their
chips<00:04:00.220> and<00:04:00.520> they<00:04:00.670> should<00:04:00.880> just<00:04:00.910> go<00:04:01.240> for<00:04:01.510> go<00:04:02.140> for

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
chips and they should just go for go for

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.760 
chips and they should just go for go for
the<00:04:02.410> guts

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
the guts

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.250 
the guts
I<00:04:02.920> mean<00:04:03.450> sometimes<00:04:04.450> so<00:04:04.690> I<00:04:04.720> think<00:04:04.870> that's

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
I mean sometimes so I think that's

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.180 
I mean sometimes so I think that's
generally<00:04:06.100> people's<00:04:06.490> biggest<00:04:06.820> mistake
