00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
larger triangles are going to come into

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.780 
larger triangles are going to come into
play<00:02:09.840> these<00:02:10.379> will<00:02:10.709> get<00:02:10.830> sewn<00:02:11.099> together<00:02:11.310> now

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
play these will get sewn together now

when<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.090> sew<00:02:12.300> them<00:02:12.510> together<00:02:12.720> you

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
when you sew them together you

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.610 
when you sew them together you
notice<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.610> back<00:02:15.239> triangle<00:02:16.049> the<00:02:16.170> larger

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
notice that the back triangle the larger

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.149 
notice that the back triangle the larger
one<00:02:16.830> is<00:02:17.069> slightly<00:02:17.819> larger<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:18.900> that's<00:02:19.650> good

a solid with a print make two blocks
with<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:31.960> solid<00:04:32.530> pinwheel<00:04:33.039> in<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:33.550> center

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
with the solid pinwheel in the center

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.809 
with the solid pinwheel in the center
and<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.509> print<00:04:34.840> on<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.139> outside<00:04:35.860> and<00:04:36.310> make

together sewing the center seam the same

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.320 
together sewing the center seam the same
idea<00:04:53.409> as<00:04:53.650> you<00:04:53.889> did<00:04:54.129> with<00:04:54.370> the<00:04:54.550> pinwheel<00:04:54.970> so

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
idea as you did with the pinwheel so

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.240 
idea as you did with the pinwheel so
we've<00:04:55.479> taken<00:04:55.720> one<00:04:56.110> simple<00:04:56.530> block<00:04:56.740> and<00:04:57.009> we've

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
we've taken one simple block and we've

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.640 
we've taken one simple block and we've
multiplied<00:04:57.819> it<00:04:57.969> by<00:04:58.000> four<00:04:58.509> and<00:04:58.840> by<00:04:59.050> doing<00:04:59.469> that

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
multiplied it by four and by doing that

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.129 
multiplied it by four and by doing that
we<00:05:00.009> get<00:05:00.280> paint<00:05:00.610> table<00:05:00.969> topper<00:05:01.389> and<00:05:01.539> it's<00:05:01.990> a

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139
