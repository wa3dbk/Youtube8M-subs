very convincing and then what happened

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.169 
very convincing and then what happened
there<00:00:13.830> because<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.190> TF<00:00:14.460> pick<00:00:14.670> really<00:00:15.000> didn't

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
there because the TF pick really didn't

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.779 
there because the TF pick really didn't
work<00:00:15.299> out<00:00:15.420> now<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.680> thing<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.609> upper

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789

work out now the thing is the upper
surface<00:00:17.850> is<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.359> peak<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:19.220> really<00:00:20.359> is

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
surface is a peak that is really is

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.120 
surface is a peak that is really is
really<00:00:21.600> bad<00:00:21.750> in<00:00:21.900> Lane<00:00:22.050> but<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.500> can<00:00:22.650> manage<00:00:22.859> to

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
really bad in Lane but you can manage to

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.670 
really bad in Lane but you can manage to
place<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.670> farm<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.269> get<00:00:24.960> some<00:00:25.199> gangs<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.529> other

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
here for a while so I use yeah I didn't

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.900 
here for a while so I use yeah I didn't
really<00:00:31.500> know<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:31.710> MIT<00:00:32.130> will<00:00:32.369> do<00:00:32.489> on<00:00:32.610> me<00:00:32.730> that

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
really know that MIT will do on me that

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.220 
really know that MIT will do on me that
how<00:00:32.969> much<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.210> could<00:00:33.390> take<00:00:33.570> on<00:00:33.719> everything<00:00:33.960> and

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
how much I could take on everything and

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.100 
how much I could take on everything and
he<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.890> kimmy<00:00:35.160> 101<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.730> after<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.809> wasn't

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
he is kimmy 101 and after that it wasn't

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.020 
he is kimmy 101 and after that it wasn't
over<00:00:37.200> but<00:00:37.500> there<00:00:37.770> was<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.340> much<00:00:38.430> better<00:00:38.640> they

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
over but there was so much better they

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.970 
over but there was so much better they
had<00:00:39.180> Rumble<00:00:39.629> knock<00:00:40.020> tuna<00:00:40.350> fish<00:00:40.559> which<00:00:40.770> could

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
had Rumble knock tuna fish which could

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.690 
had Rumble knock tuna fish which could
go<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.430> on<00:00:41.550> me<00:00:41.969> or<00:00:42.149> pusu<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.840> once<00:00:43.530> at<00:00:43.710> us<00:00:43.829> their

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
go in on me or pusu and once at us their

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.369 
go in on me or pusu and once at us their
self<00:00:44.940> was<00:00:45.090> better<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.450> we<00:00:45.600> lost<00:00:45.719> early<00:00:46.110> so<00:00:46.140> it

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
self was better and we lost early so it

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.470 
self was better and we lost early so it
was<00:00:46.500> for<00:00:46.950> sure<00:00:47.100> over<00:00:47.370> after<00:00:47.670> 20<00:00:48.090> minutes<00:00:48.239> I

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
was for sure over after 20 minutes I

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.569 
was for sure over after 20 minutes I
think<00:00:48.559> why<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.620> choice<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.100> go<00:00:50.250> for<00:00:50.460> that

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
think why the choice to go for that

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.910 
think why the choice to go for that
setup<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.690> contrast<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.230> what<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.500> want<00:00:52.620> four

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
setup in contrast to what you want four

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.069 
setup in contrast to what you want four
in<00:00:53.039> Game<00:00:53.280> one<00:00:53.520> was<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.239> kind<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.449> like<00:00:54.629> we<00:00:54.930> got

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
in Game one was it kind of like we got

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.790 
in Game one was it kind of like we got
this<00:00:55.230> anyway<00:00:55.590> or<00:00:55.860> yeah<00:00:56.730> well<00:00:57.170> it<00:00:58.170> was<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.620> try

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
this anyway or yeah well it was to try

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.770 
this anyway or yeah well it was to try
like<00:00:59.010> like<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.489> said<00:00:59.699> if<00:00:59.820> I<00:00:59.940> if<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.329> play<00:01:00.510> TF

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
like like I said if I if I play TF

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.029 
like like I said if I if I play TF
better<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.050> think<00:01:01.170> we'll<00:01:01.410> go<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.559> won<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> game

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
better I think we'll go I won the game

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.210 
better I think we'll go I won the game
because<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:03.210> wouldn't<00:01:04.140> have<00:01:04.260> died<00:01:04.409> 101<00:01:04.979> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
because I wouldn't have died 101 the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.830 
because I wouldn't have died 101 the
fish<00:01:05.369> would<00:01:05.489> get<00:01:05.850> ahead<00:01:06.090> i<00:01:06.150> would<00:01:06.390> have<00:01:06.510> farmed

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
fish would get ahead i would have farmed

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.440 
fish would get ahead i would have farmed
even<00:01:07.229> more<00:01:07.380> than<00:01:07.530> him<00:01:07.680> at<00:01:07.799> some<00:01:08.010> point<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.460> I

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
even more than him at some point and I

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.480 
even more than him at some point and I
could<00:01:09.720> get<00:01:10.140> guns<00:01:10.350> easily<00:01:10.740> like<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.130> only<00:01:11.340> gun

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
could get guns easily like the only gun

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.429 
could get guns easily like the only gun
guy<00:01:11.670> almost<00:01:11.820> got<00:01:12.000> embarrassed<00:01:12.689> but<00:01:12.990> his<00:01:13.170> robot

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
guy almost got embarrassed but his robot

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.590 
guy almost got embarrassed but his robot
she<00:01:13.619> was<00:01:13.740> really<00:01:13.890> bad<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.790> normal<00:01:14.970> game<00:01:15.270> with

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
she was really bad in a normal game with

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.300 
she was really bad in a normal game with
if<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.960> was<00:01:16.110> more<00:01:16.290> confident<00:01:16.680> with<00:01:16.740> TF<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.130> think

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
if I was more confident with TF I think

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.039 
if I was more confident with TF I think
I<00:01:17.369> will<00:01:17.460> have<00:01:17.520> at<00:01:18.180> least<00:01:18.360> one<00:01:18.570> or<00:01:18.689> two<00:01:18.720> kills

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
I will have at least one or two kills

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.109 
I will have at least one or two kills
you<00:01:19.229> sweetie<00:01:19.560> pea<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.369> if<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.610> don't<00:01:20.670> die<00:01:20.909> then

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
you sweetie pea and if I don't die then

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.399 
you sweetie pea and if I don't die then
the<00:01:21.270> game<00:01:21.390> can<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.630> no<00:01:21.780> water<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.170> but

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
the game can is no water on that but

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.399 
the game can is no water on that but
yeah<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.040> think<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.490> our<00:01:24.030> pics<00:01:24.479> were<00:01:24.659> decent<00:01:25.290> to

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
yeah I think the our pics were decent to

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.160 
yeah I think the our pics were decent to
win<00:01:25.560> early<00:01:25.830> but<00:01:26.009> we<00:01:26.159> didn't<00:01:26.400> play<00:01:26.549> as<00:01:26.640> good<00:01:26.790> and

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
win early but we didn't play as good and

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.080 
win early but we didn't play as good and
then<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.320> course<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.890> comes<00:01:29.009> down<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.520> game<00:01:29.790> 3

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
then of course it comes down to game 3

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.240 
then of course it comes down to game 3
is<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.600> where<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.869> excel<00:01:31.470> because<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.130> that

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
is this where you excel because of that

kills<00:01:57.750> in<00:01:57.899> your<00:01:57.990> advantage<00:01:58.439> meant<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.950> we

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
kills in your advantage meant that we

had to not throw the game and that's

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.109 
had to not throw the game and that's
releasing<00:02:01.500> normally<00:02:01.770> not<00:02:02.670> throw<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.939> game

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.929 
releasing normally not throw the game
really<00:02:03.329> easy<00:02:03.540> not<00:02:03.719> for<00:02:03.869> every<00:02:04.079> team<00:02:04.290> but<00:02:04.939> next

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
really easy not for every team but next

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.119 
really easy not for every team but next
round<00:02:06.270> you'll<00:02:06.509> be<00:02:06.659> going<00:02:06.960> up<00:02:07.200> against<00:02:07.649> royale

that says i just want to become the
champion<00:02:13.360> again<00:02:13.890> of<00:02:14.890> course<00:02:15.190> I<00:02:15.370> think<00:02:15.730> we<00:02:15.790> had

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
champion again of course I think we had

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.460 
champion again of course I think we had
good<00:02:15.940> sense<00:02:16.210> especially<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.840> steam<00:02:17.050> actually

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
good sense especially the steam actually

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.250 
good sense especially the steam actually
like<00:02:18.010> even<00:02:18.370> more<00:02:18.520> than<00:02:18.580> then<00:02:19.390> that<00:02:19.810> t<00:02:19.960> mind<00:02:20.110> the

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
like even more than then that t mind the

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.840 
like even more than then that t mind the
most<00:02:20.350> afraid<00:02:20.590> of<00:02:20.740> is<00:02:20.890> probably<00:02:21.040> ask<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.400> telecom

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
most afraid of is probably ask a telecom

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.120 
most afraid of is probably ask a telecom
but<00:02:22.540> besides<00:02:23.140> that<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.440> other<00:02:23.560> teams<00:02:23.800> that<00:02:24.010> he

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
but besides that the other teams that he

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.620 
but besides that the other teams that he
I<00:02:24.340> think<00:02:24.520> we<00:02:24.580> have<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.730> good<00:02:24.910> chance<00:02:24.970> they<00:02:25.390> are

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
I think we have a good chance they are

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.650 
I think we have a good chance they are
not<00:02:25.930> worse<00:02:26.290> than<00:02:26.640> not<00:02:27.640> c9<00:02:28.000> CNN<00:02:28.300> is<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.450> really

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
not worse than not c9 CNN is a really

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.510 
not worse than not c9 CNN is a really
good<00:02:28.750> team<00:02:28.960> and<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.200> think<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.590> royal<00:02:30.160> or<00:02:30.250> OMG

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
good team and I think the royal or OMG

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.100 
good team and I think the royal or OMG
will<00:02:30.670> play<00:02:30.880> same<00:02:31.120> as<00:02:31.270> them<00:02:31.450> maybe<00:02:31.780> I<00:02:31.840> mean<00:02:31.990> more

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
will play same as them maybe I mean more

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.690 
will play same as them maybe I mean more
crazy<00:02:32.350> because<00:02:32.740> they<00:02:33.010> go<00:02:33.130> aggressive<00:02:33.370> all<00:02:33.610> the

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
crazy because they go aggressive all the

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.730 
crazy because they go aggressive all the
time<00:02:33.880> but<00:02:34.140> besides<00:02:35.140> that<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.320> think<00:02:35.590> they<00:02:35.650> are

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
time but besides that I think they are

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.350 
time but besides that I think they are
strong<00:02:36.010> team<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:36.250> if<00:02:36.550> we<00:02:36.670> beat<00:02:36.820> Cena<00:02:37.060> we<00:02:37.210> can
