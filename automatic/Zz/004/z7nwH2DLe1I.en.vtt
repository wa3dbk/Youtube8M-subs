00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
actually looked perfectly neat when I

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.660

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
and they do come up like four or five

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.869 
and they do come up like four or five
different<00:00:57.420> pairs<00:00:57.809> which<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.109> pretty<00:00:58.260> good<00:00:58.559> and

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
different pairs which is pretty good and

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.189

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
do get a case it's pretty much exactly

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.939 
do get a case it's pretty much exactly
the<00:01:03.510> same<00:01:03.719> as<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.930> case<00:01:04.110> they<00:01:04.290> give<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.650> I'm

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.500 
the same as the case they give you I'm
not<00:01:05.309> sure<00:01:05.369> if<00:01:05.610> it's<00:01:05.670> exactly<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.330> same

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
not sure if it's exactly the same

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.510 
not sure if it's exactly the same
quality<00:01:06.990> but<00:01:07.200> it's<00:01:07.710> still<00:01:07.920> pretty<00:01:07.979> hard<00:01:08.340> has

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
quality but it's still pretty hard has

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.130 
quality but it's still pretty hard has
some<00:01:08.820> protection<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.790> as<00:01:11.869> far<00:01:12.869> as<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
some protection on it and as far as the

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.140 
some protection on it and as far as the
headphones<00:01:13.500> go<00:01:13.740> they<00:01:13.950> look<00:01:14.130> exactly<00:01:14.280> like<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
headphones go they look exactly like the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.020 
headphones go they look exactly like the
real<00:01:15.180> ones<00:01:15.920> they<00:01:16.920> feel<00:01:17.189> like<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.549> real<00:01:17.729> ones

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
because they're not all that bad I

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.860 
because they're not all that bad I
actually<00:02:42.610> prefer<00:02:43.090> them<00:02:43.300> compared<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:43.750> the

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870

actually prefer them compared to the
regular<00:02:44.050> apple<00:02:44.380> headphones<00:02:44.709> because<00:02:45.070> they're

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
regular apple headphones because they're

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.340 
regular apple headphones because they're
in<00:02:45.430> here<00:02:45.700> but<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.510> audio<00:02:46.630> quality<00:02:46.870> is
