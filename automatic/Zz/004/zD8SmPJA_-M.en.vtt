good<00:01:04.180> for<00:01:04.210> a<00:01:04.449> situation<00:01:04.720> like<00:01:05.290> this<00:01:05.590> if<00:01:06.310> you

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
good for a situation like this if you

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:13.219 
good for a situation like this if you
have<00:01:06.549> a<00:01:06.580> nail<00:01:06.940> gun<00:01:06.970> that<00:01:07.539> would<00:01:07.690> be<00:01:07.840> good
