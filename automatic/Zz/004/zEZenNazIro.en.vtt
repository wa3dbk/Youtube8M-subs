with an iron block on top that our block

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.859 
with an iron block on top that our block
is<00:00:22.170> not<00:00:22.289> important<00:00:22.800> oh<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.699> as<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.600> can<00:00:24.689> see

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
over here I I don't have this hooked up

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.419 
over here I I don't have this hooked up
to<00:00:27.720> any<00:00:27.990> kind<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.260> string<00:00:28.590> at<00:00:28.680> all<00:00:28.800> so

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
to any kind of string at all so

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.550 
to any kind of string at all so
obviously<00:00:29.910> won't<00:00:30.179> work<00:00:30.480> but<00:00:30.779> look<00:00:31.140> over<00:00:31.349> here

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560

obviously won't work but look over here
I've<00:00:31.740> got<00:00:31.769> string<00:00:32.309> hooked<00:00:32.550> up<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.940> side<00:00:33.239> of

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
I've got string hooked up to the side of

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.240 
I've got string hooked up to the side of
this<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:35.930> yeah<00:00:36.930> it's<00:00:37.200> I'll<00:00:37.800> show<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.190> where

this and yeah it's I'll show you where

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.060 
this and yeah it's I'll show you where
this<00:00:38.370> ends<00:00:38.640> real<00:00:38.940> quick<00:00:39.180> as<00:00:39.680> you<00:00:40.680> can<00:00:40.739> see<00:00:40.980> it

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
this ends real quick as you can see it

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.459 
this ends real quick as you can see it
doesn't<00:00:41.309> really<00:00:41.430> end<00:00:41.760> at<00:00:42.360> any<00:00:42.450> specific<00:00:42.780> part

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
doesn't really end at any specific part

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.440 
doesn't really end at any specific part
but<00:00:43.680> when<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:43.860> walk<00:00:44.100> right<00:00:44.309> into<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:45.239> does

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
but when I walk right into it it does

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.220 
but when I walk right into it it does
send<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.719> charge<00:00:46.100> if<00:00:47.100> we<00:00:47.280> keep<00:00:47.430> walking<00:00:47.760> past<00:00:47.910> it

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
send a charge if we keep walking past it

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.690 
send a charge if we keep walking past it
for<00:00:49.230> some<00:00:49.410> reason<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.770> torch<00:00:50.010> burns<00:00:50.280> out<00:00:50.520> and

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
for some reason the torch burns out and

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.880 
for some reason the torch burns out and
it<00:00:51.329> kind<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.600> dulls<00:00:51.960> out<00:00:52.199> but<00:00:52.469> if<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.649> want<00:00:52.829> to

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
it kind of dulls out but if you want to

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.939 
it kind of dulls out but if you want to
reset<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:54.050> you<00:00:55.050> just<00:00:55.199> walk<00:00:55.320> into<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.559> first

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
reset it you just walk into that first

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.510 
reset it you just walk into that first
piece<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.190> string<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.610> it's<00:00:56.760> reset<00:00:57.770> so<00:00:58.770> you

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
piece of string and it's reset so you

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.069 
piece of string and it's reset so you
know<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.640> really<00:01:00.090> don't<00:01:00.120> know<00:01:00.329> exactly<00:01:00.840> what

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
know I really don't know exactly what

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.990 
know I really don't know exactly what
this<00:01:01.230> could<00:01:02.039> do<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.609> don't<00:01:02.789> know<00:01:02.850> if<00:01:02.910> they're

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
this could do I don't know if they're

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.390 
this could do I don't know if they're
gonna<00:01:03.059> keep<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> game<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:04.500> will<00:01:05.129> send<00:01:05.309> us

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.649 
just wanted to show you what I found
there<00:01:16.110> are<00:01:16.259> some<00:01:16.439> other<00:01:16.590> things<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:17.580> did<00:01:18.420> notice

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
there are some other things I did notice

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.880 
there are some other things I did notice
that<00:01:18.840> when<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:19.229> hooked<00:01:19.380> up<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.740> other

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
that when it's hooked up to the other

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.340 
that when it's hooked up to the other
side's<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.340> doesn't<00:01:20.520> like<00:01:20.670> do<00:01:20.759> anything<00:01:21.350> like

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
side's it doesn't like do anything like

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.149 
side's it doesn't like do anything like
so<00:01:22.710> i<00:01:23.750> don't<00:01:24.750> know<00:01:24.810> if<00:01:24.900> i<00:01:24.960> get<00:01:25.020> rid<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.439> if

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
so i don't know if i get rid of this if

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.090 
so i don't know if i get rid of this if
you<00:01:26.700> start<00:01:26.970> working<00:01:27.240> or<00:01:27.360> not<00:01:27.479> but<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.799> doesn't

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
you start working or not but it doesn't

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.499 
you start working or not but it doesn't
look<00:01:29.159> like<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.060> might<00:01:30.210> just<00:01:30.329> be

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
look like it so it might just be

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.060 
look like it so it might just be
unidirectional<00:01:31.880> uni-directional<00:01:33.890> so<00:01:34.890> as<00:01:34.979> you

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
unidirectional uni-directional so as you

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.360 
unidirectional uni-directional so as you
can<00:01:35.159> see

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
can see

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.880 
can see
right<00:01:37.000> here<00:01:37.360> when<00:01:37.960> I<00:01:37.990> walk<00:01:38.200> into<00:01:38.380> it<00:01:38.590> you<00:01:38.740> can

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
right here when I walk into it you can

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.980 
right here when I walk into it you can
barely<00:01:39.250> see<00:01:39.790> the<00:01:40.230> string<00:01:41.230> outline<00:01:42.810> from<00:01:43.810> each

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
barely see the string outline from each

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.290 
barely see the string outline from each
side<00:01:44.260> but<00:01:44.890> there's<00:01:45.040> no<00:01:45.190> in<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.310> middle<00:01:45.550> so

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
side but there's no in the middle so

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.250 
side but there's no in the middle so
it's<00:01:46.480> it's<00:01:46.720> I<00:01:47.080> guess<00:01:47.140> it's<00:01:47.680> kind<00:01:48.160> of<00:01:48.250> assuming

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
it's it's I guess it's kind of assuming

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.510 
it's it's I guess it's kind of assuming
making<00:01:50.260> assumptions<00:01:50.590> that<00:01:50.890> there<00:01:51.040> is<00:01:51.160> string

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
making assumptions that there is string

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.750 
making assumptions that there is string
there<00:01:51.700> when<00:01:51.880> I<00:01:51.910> walk<00:01:52.120> into<00:01:52.300> this<00:01:52.510> side<00:01:52.810> string

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
there when I walk into this side string

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.180 
there when I walk into this side string
but<00:01:54.760> I<00:01:54.790> don't<00:01:55.000> know<00:01:55.890> again<00:01:56.890> just<00:01:57.130> a<00:01:57.160> little
