00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.949 
trick and for that what we're gonna do
is<00:02:47.120> take<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.510> forest<00:02:47.870> so<00:02:48.050> one<00:02:48.260> two<00:02:48.650> three<00:02:49.220> four

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
is take the forest so one two three four

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.440 
is take the forest so one two three four
we<00:02:50.959> can<00:02:51.110> also<00:02:51.230> show<00:02:51.290> them<00:02:51.620> like<00:02:51.940> my<00:02:52.940> all<00:02:53.209> the

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
we can also show them like my all the

we can also show them like my all the
four<00:02:53.660> races<00:02:54.110> but<00:02:54.320> actually<00:02:55.120> this<00:02:56.120> is<00:02:56.180> a

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
four races but actually this is a

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.810 
four races but actually this is a

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
situation so we'll place these of space

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.020 
situation so we'll place these of space
here<00:02:59.090> which<00:02:59.600> is<00:02:59.720> single<00:03:00.170> back<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:01.760> double

here which is single back the double
back<00:03:02.209> aces<00:03:02.600> here<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:04.280> now<00:03:04.610> what<00:03:05.000> we'll<00:03:05.150> do<00:03:05.330> is

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480
