00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.510
 operation we begin with check 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:11.250
 correctness and density of landing disk 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.380
 coupling on the splines of the input shaft 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.540
 before installation 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.960
 in the disc is always 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.480
 we just wiped the shaft check 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.279
 the presence of coaxiality of the slots because 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.520
 There are situations when already on 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.960
 mounted clutch 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.119
 taxi turns out that they come 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.510
 box because the slot is going wrong 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.890
 here let us check here new disc 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.270
 see he leaves quite calmly 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.960
 note that I try not to 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.739
 touch the friction linings and here 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.430
 now we will lubricate the disc we will 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.650
 slots here because in fact 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:56.130
 since we don't know in which position 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.930
 grip will work where surplus 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.079
 there is no need for grease on the shaft 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.329
 that is, it is a special lubricant which 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.100
 designed to work with this node in 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.049
 each clutch kit there is this 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.320
 grease - we smeared that 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.360
 hub and gently dress on the shaft 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.509
 in parallel, we look like it's all 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.079
 here we are moving in parallel we immediately 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.729
 checked and ease of movement smeared 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:24.870
 shaft and 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:30.090
 lubricated the hub of excess grease 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.990
 remove from both sides checking clarity 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.909
 landing disk 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.500
 proceed to install the new releaser 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.290
 bearing respecting while 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.430
 maximum cleanliness and accuracy if 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.990
 when installing here get 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.659
 again abrasive or some kind of dirt 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.479
 all this is thin thin to nalchik 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.520
 fall into the release bearing itself 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.210
 and he unfortunately will not live long 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.570
 so our recommendation is all installations 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.520
 produce with closed traffic jams and 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.760
 only then after mounting them 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.350
 dismantle once again I remind you that all 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.979
 works are carried out only by hand 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.979
 tool 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.720
 we 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.580
 I want to draw attention to these 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.269
 there is the so-called tangential 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:43.519
 the springs are exactly these springs transmit 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:47.310
 starting effort at at that moment when 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.599
 the clutch is squeezed and starts 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.870
 basket rotation 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.760
 it constantly rotates here too 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.730
 There is a transfer about carefully ear 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.489
 clutch disc forces 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.680
 means at installation please pay 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.900
 attention to the state of these 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.000
 tangential springs they are pre 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.829
 formed 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.280
 and depends on their condition at all 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.720
 smoothness of the clutch 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.120
 there are often situations when in the process 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.200
 operating the basket falls to the floor 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.599
 there you are 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.440
 heavy enough knot lost shape 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.290
 this spring 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.720
 here and in this place if two springs 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:34.430
 normal one bent in this place 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.870
 already pressing pressure disk will 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.760
 incomplete or it will not be discharged 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.680
 either fit accordingly 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.019
 way the grip will not work 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.430
 correct when installing the clutch 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.379
 need to use the kit 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.299
 special mandrels providing 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.840
 maximum alignment of the assembly 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.269
 exactly 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:55.169
 if you do not check the alignment of the 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:57.799
 there may be a shift in 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:04:01.139
 vertical or horizontal drive and 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:03.660
 when you already have a box 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:05.609
 just don't get don't fit you 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.150
 will have to dismantle the furnace node again 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:10.829
 Now we put carefully 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.949
 looked positioning that is 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:16.970
 to turn aside so as it should my 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:19.109
 center on it correctly installed now 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.910
 set pressed to the flywheel 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.910
 and then put the centering 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:59.550
 then puff must be carried by star 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.130
 her they one after another in the bolts should 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.500
 drag on with a star exactly this 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:08.630
 ensure uniform fit 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:13.910
 during operation of the plane 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:17.370
 baskets and guarantee you that 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:23.220
 after tightening the spring diaphragm blades 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:26.840
 can disperse in different directions you 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:30.060
 see from the mechanic if several times 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.490
 I will say gradually increasing the tightening force 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.230
 pass the basket 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:39.470
 it is absolutely right that way 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.470
 all planes are aligned 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:52.389
 tightening should be done only one 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:06:00.400
 just before the click all and the same star 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:06:02.830
 and so the basket and clutch disc 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.280
 fixed on the flywheel centering 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.150
 mandrel removed bolt tightening held 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.300
 torque wrench according to 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.830
 prescribed time 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:14.800
 now my witnesses are witnesses 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:18.120
 how all the main operations are related 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:22.080
 with clutch replacement were carried out 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:26.259
 surfaces were cleaned of dirt was 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.159
 from the center to the new drive and the cart was 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:30.189
 attracted 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:31.389
 using a dynamic key since 

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:34.449
 it is supposed 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:39.389
 Well, now it will actually be 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:41.469
 reverse installation of the box and pumping 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:44.169
 quarrel clutch cylinder 

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:46.210
 Well, the work is finished now remains 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:48.039
 perform a standard control operation and 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:50.139
 adjustment of convergence and camber 

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:52.930
 wheels and car can pass 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:56.759
 client, we thank service max drive 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.759
 and company ctf trading gmbh
