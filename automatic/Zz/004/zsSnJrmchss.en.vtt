what<00:03:18.799> I<00:03:18.829> would<00:03:19.069> do<00:03:19.190> is<00:03:19.340> I<00:03:19.459> would<00:03:19.489> actually<00:03:19.730> go

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
what I would do is I would actually go

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.530 
what I would do is I would actually go
from<00:03:20.390> print<00:03:21.200> to<00:03:21.319> print<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:22.760> for<00:03:23.150> a<00:03:23.180> smaller

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
from print to print and for a smaller

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.040 
from print to print and for a smaller
animal<00:03:23.989> you<00:03:24.170> could

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
animal you could

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.650 
animal you could
do<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.380> whole<00:03:25.560> group<00:03:25.830> of<00:03:25.980> prints<00:03:26.340> if<00:03:27.300> he<00:03:27.510> was

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
do the whole group of prints if he was

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.970 
do the whole group of prints if he was
at<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:27.840> gallop<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.380> you<00:03:28.500> can<00:03:28.680> measure<00:03:28.860> it

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
at a gallop and you can measure it

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.610 
at a gallop and you can measure it
instead<00:03:29.310> of<00:03:29.460> breaking<00:03:29.910> out<00:03:30.120> this<00:03:30.300> ruler<00:03:30.630> the
