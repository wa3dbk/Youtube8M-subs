me<00:05:33.340> that's<00:05:33.880> good<00:05:34.360> consistency<00:05:35.110> but<00:05:35.889> as<00:05:36.010> a

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.040 
me that's good consistency but as a

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.950 
me that's good consistency but as a
toughy<00:05:36.490> also<00:05:36.729> continues<00:05:37.240> to<00:05:37.270> cook<00:05:37.630> it's<00:05:37.840> gonna

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
toughy also continues to cook it's gonna

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.150 
toughy also continues to cook it's gonna
get<00:05:38.169> a<00:05:38.229> little<00:05:38.440> bit<00:05:38.680> thicker<00:05:39.060> so<00:05:40.060> let's<00:05:40.360> add<00:05:40.570> a
