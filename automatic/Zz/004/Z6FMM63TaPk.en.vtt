right<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.460> don't<00:01:26.909> think<00:01:27.359> if<00:01:27.539> Dinah's<00:01:27.929> goes

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
right and I don't think if Dinah's goes

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.899 
right and I don't think if Dinah's goes
to<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.380> juice<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:29.249> looks<00:01:29.429> like<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.759> race

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
to the juice and it looks like that race

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.279 
to the juice and it looks like that race
could<00:01:30.090> cut<00:01:30.270> up<00:01:30.389> a<00:01:30.479> bit<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.749> think<00:01:30.929> Boston

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
could cut up a bit and I think Boston

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.230 
could cut up a bit and I think Boston
Bob<00:01:31.469> will<00:01:31.649> be<00:01:31.740> definitely<00:01:32.310> there<00:01:32.700> there<00:01:32.939> bits
