00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
to be able to execute I'm gonna do and

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.399 
to be able to execute I'm gonna do and
14<00:01:07.619> 15<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.670> even<00:01:08.970> example<00:01:09.450> 14<00:01:09.930> progression

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
14 15 this even example 14 progression

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:20.430 
14 15 this even example 14 progression
I'll<00:01:11.040> proceed

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:44.580 

if<00:01:21.440> I<00:01:21.620> were<00:01:21.800> a<00:01:21.830> change<00:01:22.190> to<00:01:22.610> do<00:01:22.760> a<00:01:22.790> rhythm

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:54.050 

now<00:01:45.590> there's<00:01:46.160> another<00:01:46.280> progression

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:06.559 

Oh

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:11.070 

make<00:02:07.569> it<00:02:07.749> off<00:02:07.899> the<00:02:08.140> top<00:02:08.379> of<00:02:08.410> my<00:02:08.590> head<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.810> trick

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
make it off the top of my head the trick

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.199 
make it off the top of my head the trick
is<00:02:11.110> learning<00:02:11.200> progressions<00:02:11.830> and<00:02:12.209> different

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
is learning progressions and different

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.600 
is learning progressions and different
key<00:02:13.360> so<00:02:13.720> that<00:02:14.110> way<00:02:14.410> you<00:02:14.470> can<00:02:14.709> play<00:02:14.980> all<00:02:15.250> around

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
key so that way you can play all around

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.420 
key so that way you can play all around
the<00:02:16.000> pan<00:02:16.209> and<00:02:16.989> that's<00:02:17.200> trinette<00:02:17.650> see<00:02:18.010> let<00:02:18.400> me

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
the pan and that's trinette see let me

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:27.750 
the pan and that's trinette see let me
see

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.670

one<00:03:46.620> thing<00:03:46.830> that<00:03:46.860> I've<00:03:47.130> discovered<00:03:47.550> is<00:03:47.700> the

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
one thing that I've discovered is the

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.610 
one thing that I've discovered is the
fact<00:03:48.090> that<00:03:48.209> I<00:03:48.330> think<00:03:48.720> number<00:03:49.200> of<00:03:49.260> beginning

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
fact that I think number of beginning

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.570 
fact that I think number of beginning
students<00:03:49.980> they<00:03:50.099> don't<00:03:50.280> realize<00:03:50.550> how

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
students they don't realize how

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.360 
students they don't realize how
important<00:03:51.300> it<00:03:51.480> is<00:03:51.540> to<00:03:53.540> well<00:03:54.540> they<00:03:54.720> don't<00:03:54.840> we

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
important it is to well they don't we

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.780 
important it is to well they don't we
acknowledge<00:03:56.370> or<00:03:56.640> they<00:03:56.970> forget<00:03:57.330> that<00:03:57.870> this

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
acknowledge or they forget that this

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.640 
acknowledge or they forget that this
keyboard<00:03:59.790> is<00:03:59.910> percussionist<00:04:00.569> so<00:04:01.440> it's<00:04:01.530> all

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
keyboard is percussionist so it's all
