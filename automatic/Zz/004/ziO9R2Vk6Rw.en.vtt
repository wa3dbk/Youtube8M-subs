with high winds high heat and low
humidity<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.640> she<00:00:32.640> will<00:00:32.790> decide<00:00:33.059> when<00:00:33.270> they

humidity and she will decide when they
go<00:00:33.540> out<00:00:33.570> once<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.469> rains<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:35.040> get<00:00:35.160> cooler

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
go out once it rains you get cooler

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.740 
go out once it rains you get cooler
temperatures<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.030> higher<00:00:36.180> humidity<00:00:36.510> and

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
temperatures and higher humidity and

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.369 
temperatures and higher humidity and
eventually<00:00:37.710> winter<00:00:37.980> comes<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:39.050> just<00:00:40.050> as<00:00:40.200> the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
eventually winter comes and just as the

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.940 
eventually winter comes and just as the
snow<00:00:40.559> flies<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.160> puts<00:00:41.399> them<00:00:41.520> out<00:00:42.950> the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
snow flies and that puts them out the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.010 
snow flies and that puts them out the
other<00:00:44.100> interesting<00:00:44.610> thing<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.420> Russia

you're in once in a hundred year event
like<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.939> heat<00:01:12.659> wave<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:13.200> you're<00:01:13.950> going<00:01:14.189> to

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
like this heat wave is you're going to

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.359 
like this heat wave is you're going to
get<00:01:14.400> fires<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.740> you're<00:01:16.740> going<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.040> have<00:01:17.159> to

deal with that and if you've gone for

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.740 
deal with that and if you've gone for
years<00:01:20.280> without<00:01:20.549> big<00:01:21.000> fires<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.600> get

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
years without big fires you get

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.390 
years without big fires you get
complacent<00:01:22.140> maybe<00:01:22.590> you're<00:01:22.799> not<00:01:22.920> prepared<00:01:23.340> for

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
complacent maybe you're not prepared for

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.760 
complacent maybe you're not prepared for
this<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.939> it's<00:01:24.479> difficult<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:25.320> be<00:01:25.350> prepared

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
this and it's difficult to be prepared

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.320 
this and it's difficult to be prepared
in<00:01:25.950> fact<00:01:26.159> it's<00:01:26.369> impossible<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.939> be<00:01:27.119> prepared

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
in fact it's impossible to be prepared

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.660 
in fact it's impossible to be prepared
for<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.810> once<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> hundred<00:01:28.320> year<00:01:28.650> event<00:01:28.860> like

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
for a once in a hundred year event like

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.380 
for a once in a hundred year event like
this<00:01:29.930> so<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.350> best<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.770> can<00:01:31.890> do<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.310> heard<00:01:33.180> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
this so the best you can do is heard the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.390 
this so the best you can do is heard the
fire<00:01:33.570> around<00:01:33.930> when<00:01:34.650> you've<00:01:34.740> got<00:01:34.860> fires<00:01:35.159> like

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
fire around when you've got fires like

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.090 
fire around when you've got fires like
this<00:01:35.460> there<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:37.079> are<00:01:37.170> caused<00:01:37.380> by<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.650> once<00:01:37.979> in

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
this there that are caused by a once in

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.520 
this there that are caused by a once in
a<00:01:38.159> hundred<00:01:38.280> year<00:01:38.579> event

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
a hundred year event

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.800 
a hundred year event
you<00:01:39.979> can't<00:01:40.220> put<00:01:40.400> fires<00:01:40.670> out<00:01:40.909> people<00:01:41.479> can't<00:01:41.690> put

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
you can't put fires out people can't put

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.719 
you can't put fires out people can't put
fires<00:01:42.020> out<00:01:42.260> all<00:01:42.560> you<00:01:42.799> can<00:01:42.890> do<00:01:43.070> is<00:01:43.250> hurt<00:01:43.549> them

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
fires out all you can do is hurt them

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.910 
fires out all you can do is hurt them
around<00:01:43.970> so<00:01:44.750> you<00:01:45.200> got<00:01:45.320> to<00:01:45.409> look<00:01:45.560> at<00:01:45.650> what's<00:01:45.830> in

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
around so you got to look at what's in

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.920 
around so you got to look at what's in
the<00:01:46.010> fires<00:01:46.190> path<00:01:46.520> you<00:01:47.119> got<00:01:47.150> to<00:01:47.390> look<00:01:47.540> at<00:01:47.720> homes

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
the fires path you got to look at homes

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.010 
the fires path you got to look at homes
look<00:01:48.680> at<00:01:48.770> structures<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:49.720> maybe<00:01:50.720> set<00:01:50.990> some

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
look at structures and maybe set some

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.469 
look at structures and maybe set some
backfires<00:01:51.619> so<00:01:52.430> that's<00:01:52.610> where<00:01:52.820> your<00:01:52.940> lighting

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
backfires so that's where your lighting

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.960 
backfires so that's where your lighting
the<00:01:53.960> fuel<00:01:54.440> at<00:01:54.710> an<00:01:54.830> anchor<00:01:55.100> point<00:01:55.130> and<00:01:55.520> it's

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
the fuel at an anchor point and it's

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.880 
the fuel at an anchor point and it's
burning<00:01:56.330> towards<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:56.869> fire<00:01:57.380> therefore

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
burning towards the fire therefore

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.399 
burning towards the fire therefore
giving<00:01:58.159> you<00:01:58.220> a<00:01:58.280> wider<00:01:58.550> fire<00:01:58.880> break<00:01:59.409> your

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
giving you a wider fire break your

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.039 
giving you a wider fire break your
burning<00:02:00.649> all<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:00.890> fuel<00:02:01.220> between<00:02:01.670> you<00:02:02.420> and<00:02:02.720> the

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
burning all the fuel between you and the

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.649 
burning all the fuel between you and the
approaching<00:02:03.680> fire<00:02:03.890> you're<00:02:04.880> also<00:02:05.030> looking<00:02:05.330> at

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
approaching fire you're also looking at

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.139 
approaching fire you're also looking at
the<00:02:05.930> removing<00:02:06.320> fuel<00:02:06.560> right<00:02:07.130> you're<00:02:07.700> taking<00:02:08.030> it

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
the removing fuel right you're taking it

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.760 
the removing fuel right you're taking it
may<00:02:08.300> be<00:02:08.360> cutting<00:02:08.569> down<00:02:08.780> trees<00:02:09.080> making<00:02:09.410> a<00:02:09.560> fire

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
may be cutting down trees making a fire

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.860 
may be cutting down trees making a fire
break<00:02:10.069> trying<00:02:10.399> to<00:02:10.489> hold<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:10.819> at<00:02:10.940> a<00:02:11.000> road<00:02:11.209> so<00:02:11.780> the

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
break trying to hold it at a road so the

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.240 
break trying to hold it at a road so the
best<00:02:12.050> you<00:02:12.200> can<00:02:12.290> do<00:02:12.410> is<00:02:12.530> hurt<00:02:12.709> it<00:02:12.830> around<00:02:13.070> you

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
best you can do is hurt it around you

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.650 
best you can do is hurt it around you
can't<00:02:13.550> really<00:02:13.790> put<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.090> out<00:02:14.239> when<00:02:14.480> you're<00:02:14.600> in

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
can't really put it out when you're in

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.140 
can't really put it out when you're in
this<00:02:14.780> kind<00:02:14.959> of<00:02:15.019> situation<00:02:15.550> if<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.910> fire<00:02:17.120> is

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
this kind of situation if the fire is

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.930 
this kind of situation if the fire is
continually<00:02:18.050> moving<00:02:18.260> on<00:02:18.500> so<00:02:19.370> you've<00:02:19.610> got<00:02:19.640> to

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
continually moving on so you've got to

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.750 
continually moving on so you've got to
move<00:02:20.060> with<00:02:20.300> it<00:02:20.330> but<00:02:21.230> you<00:02:21.320> can't<00:02:21.530> forget<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.550> mop

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
move with it but you can't forget to mop

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.449 
move with it but you can't forget to mop
up<00:02:22.790> so<00:02:23.570> where<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.900> fire<00:02:24.170> has<00:02:24.470> been<00:02:25.040> through

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
up so where the fire has been through

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.630 
up so where the fire has been through
that<00:02:26.180> black<00:02:26.540> edge<00:02:26.870> unless<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.980> fire<00:02:28.190> is<00:02:28.370> put

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
that black edge unless the fire is put

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.460 
that black edge unless the fire is put
out<00:02:28.730> all<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.030> way<00:02:29.239> through<00:02:29.600> that<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:30.290> could

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
out all the way through that it could

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.320 
out all the way through that it could
reignite<00:02:30.709> again<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.550> winds<00:02:31.880> can<00:02:32.060> change

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
reignite again the winds can change

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.520 
reignite again the winds can change
direction<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:33.080> then<00:02:33.200> you've<00:02:33.319> got<00:02:33.500> another

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
direction and then you've got another

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.340 
direction and then you've got another
you<00:02:33.980> got<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:34.220> fire<00:02:34.550> where<00:02:35.090> it<00:02:35.810> was<00:02:35.959> once<00:02:36.140> out

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
you got a fire where it was once out

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.009 
you got a fire where it was once out
you've<00:02:36.590> got<00:02:36.620> a<00:02:36.769> new<00:02:36.950> fire<00:02:37.190> so<00:02:37.900> that's<00:02:38.900> very

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
you've got a new fire so that's very

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.990 
you've got a new fire so that's very
tricky<00:02:39.530> you're<00:02:39.920> also<00:02:40.069> got<00:02:40.340> to<00:02:40.459> be<00:02:40.580> you<00:02:40.910> don't

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000

tricky you're also got to be you don't
want<00:02:41.209> to<00:02:41.269> get<00:02:41.390> out<00:02:41.480> ahead<00:02:41.600> of<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:41.900> fire

off but in these fires especially when
they're<00:02:57.090> wind-driven<00:02:57.420> you<00:02:57.930> end<00:02:58.110> up<00:02:58.260> with

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
some of those five hundred fires are big

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.270 
some of those five hundred fires are big
but<00:03:30.420> probably<00:03:30.810> most<00:03:31.020> of<00:03:31.260> them<00:03:31.440> are<00:03:31.590> smaller<00:03:32.130> in

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
but probably most of them are smaller in

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.920 
but probably most of them are smaller in
comparison<00:03:32.400> so<00:03:33.300> if<00:03:33.390> you're<00:03:33.510> going<00:03:33.600> to<00:03:33.720> fly

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
comparison so if you're going to fly

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.510 
comparison so if you're going to fly
over<00:03:34.260> it<00:03:34.290> and<00:03:34.440> look<00:03:34.530> at<00:03:34.620> an<00:03:34.740> aerial<00:03:34.890> map<00:03:35.280> you'd

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
over it and look at an aerial map you'd

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.640 
over it and look at an aerial map you'd
say<00:03:35.760> you'd<00:03:36.360> kind<00:03:36.600> of<00:03:36.630> triage<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.080> situation

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
say you'd kind of triage the situation

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.900 
say you'd kind of triage the situation
need<00:03:37.770> to<00:03:37.860> say<00:03:37.950> okay<00:03:38.280> some<00:03:38.460> of<00:03:38.550> these<00:03:38.610> i'm<00:03:38.790> going

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
need to say okay some of these i'm going

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:39.860

in<00:05:50.860> us<00:05:51.100> in<00:05:51.400> Russia<00:05:51.640> we're<00:05:51.880> seeing<00:05:52.090> right<00:05:52.240> now

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
in us in Russia we're seeing right now

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.370 
in us in Russia we're seeing right now
these<00:05:53.280> incredibly<00:05:54.280> hot<00:05:54.640> temperatures<00:05:55.380> which

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
these incredibly hot temperatures which

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.650 
these incredibly hot temperatures which
lend<00:05:57.190> themselves<00:05:57.370> towards<00:05:58.120> drying<00:05:58.450> out

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
lend themselves towards drying out

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.120 
lend themselves towards drying out
vegetation<00:05:58.870> and<00:05:59.380> this<00:05:59.530> time<00:05:59.740> of<00:05:59.860> year<00:05:59.920> the

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
vegetation and this time of year the

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.440 
vegetation and this time of year the
other<00:06:00.160> thing<00:06:00.370> you<00:06:00.460> got<00:06:00.580> to<00:06:00.610> remember<00:06:00.700> is<00:06:01.150> that

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
other thing you got to remember is that

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.750 
other thing you got to remember is that
they<00:06:01.810> are<00:06:01.930> so<00:06:02.140> far<00:06:02.350> north<00:06:02.620> they<00:06:03.130> get<00:06:03.340> daylight

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
they are so far north they get daylight

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.390 
they are so far north they get daylight
for<00:06:04.150> a<00:06:04.180> long<00:06:04.570> time<00:06:05.080> so<00:06:05.710> you<00:06:05.770> get<00:06:06.010> a<00:06:06.040> lot<00:06:06.370> of

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
for a long time so you get a lot of

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.730 
for a long time so you get a lot of
radiant<00:06:06.970> heating<00:06:07.390> and<00:06:07.540> drying<00:06:07.930> from<00:06:08.290> the<00:06:08.440> Sun

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
radiant heating and drying from the Sun

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.540 
radiant heating and drying from the Sun
in<00:06:09.100> those<00:06:09.370> northern<00:06:10.000> latitudes<00:06:11.430> that<00:06:12.430> you

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
in those northern latitudes that you

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.620 
in those northern latitudes that you
don't<00:06:12.760> get<00:06:13.030> in<00:06:13.360> other<00:06:14.350> parts<00:06:14.710> of<00:06:14.830> the<00:06:14.890> world<00:06:15.630> so

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
don't get in other parts of the world so

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.040 
don't get in other parts of the world so
that<00:06:16.660> dries<00:06:17.110> out<00:06:17.320> stuff<00:06:17.620> even<00:06:17.890> further<00:06:18.780> so<00:06:19.780> yes

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
that dries out stuff even further so yes

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.030 
that dries out stuff even further so yes
when<00:06:20.230> you've<00:06:20.350> got<00:06:20.500> these<00:06:20.620> hot<00:06:20.800> dry

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:21.040 
when you've got these hot dry

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.150 
when you've got these hot dry
temperatures<00:06:21.310> you're<00:06:21.610> going<00:06:21.760> to<00:06:21.820> have<00:06:23.160> more

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 
temperatures you're going to have more

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.580 
temperatures you're going to have more
fires<00:06:24.520> and<00:06:24.880> if<00:06:25.570> the<00:06:25.780> earth<00:06:25.900> gets<00:06:26.170> warmer

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
fires and if the earth gets warmer

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.800 
fires and if the earth gets warmer
you're<00:06:26.890> going<00:06:27.100> to<00:06:27.220> have<00:06:27.280> more<00:06:27.490> fires<00:06:27.820> februari

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
you're going to have more fires februari

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.090 
you're going to have more fires februari

7th 2009 in Australia 173 people died in
one<00:06:33.520> afternoon<00:06:33.820> it<00:06:34.360> was<00:06:34.870> the<00:06:35.050> hottest<00:06:35.380> day<00:06:35.830> in

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
one afternoon it was the hottest day in

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.160 
one afternoon it was the hottest day in
Australia's<00:06:37.180> history<00:06:37.210> and<00:06:37.750> they<00:06:38.110> were

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.170 
Australia's history and they were

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.670 
Australia's history and they were
predicting<00:06:38.740> it<00:06:38.860> the<00:06:39.160> day<00:06:39.310> before<00:06:39.690> yet<00:06:40.690> what

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 
predicting it the day before yet what

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.990 
predicting it the day before yet what
happened<00:06:42.010> was<00:06:42.160> this<00:06:42.370> catastrophe

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.140 

and<00:06:46.580> Australia<00:06:47.580> it<00:06:47.760> tends<00:06:47.940> to<00:06:48.000> be<00:06:48.090> a

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
and Australia it tends to be a

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.410 
and Australia it tends to be a
bellwether<00:06:48.390> for<00:06:48.870> climate<00:06:49.500> change<00:06:49.530> and<00:06:50.420> I

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:51.420 
bellwether for climate change and I

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.090 
bellwether for climate change and I
think<00:06:51.690> we're<00:06:51.810> going<00:06:51.900> to<00:06:51.990> have<00:06:52.020> a<00:06:52.410> lot<00:06:52.890> more

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.100 
think we're going to have a lot more

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.460 
think we're going to have a lot more
fires<00:06:53.400> and<00:06:53.790> more<00:06:53.880> severe<00:06:54.210> fires<00:06:54.450> in<00:06:54.840> the<00:06:54.900> years

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:55.470 
fires and more severe fires in the years

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.719 
fires and more severe fires in the years
to<00:06:55.530> come

when I was in Russia and working with

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.369 
when I was in Russia and working with
the<00:06:59.889> Russian<00:07:00.159> smokejumpers<00:07:01.050> it<00:07:02.050> became<00:07:02.349> very

00:07:02.369 --> 00:07:02.379 
the Russian smokejumpers it became very

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:04.260 
the Russian smokejumpers it became very
clear<00:07:02.620> to<00:07:02.889> me<00:07:03.039> that<00:07:03.129> these<00:07:03.460> are<00:07:03.669> tough

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:04.270 
clear to me that these are tough

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.329 
clear to me that these are tough
sons-of-bitches<00:07:04.689> these<00:07:05.650> are<00:07:05.830> the<00:07:05.979> toughest

00:07:06.329 --> 00:07:06.339 
sons-of-bitches these are the toughest

00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:10.110 
sons-of-bitches these are the toughest
