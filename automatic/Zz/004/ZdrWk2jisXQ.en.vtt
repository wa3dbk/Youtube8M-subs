00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:14.439
 I am Julian Bassouls I am the director of the three donkeys in Paris 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:20.119
 a big pot for them 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.119
 to seduce already they must have that equipped in a manner enough 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:25.089
 in coherent e 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:27.430
 so we receive and I who have allocated in the world 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.580
 the myth of mail m more people who are asking us right to left 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.430
 which I'm getting kids from 7 right now 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.190
 everything is signed to any peace perception of the thing how in a world 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.170
 artistic 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.660
 obviously in the Koran there is a cover more or less elaborated by a 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.770
 graphic concept we have developed a vision so little is well written 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.770
 or that the mails are not completely consistent 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.880
 because the name of the group the cover of the video 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.130
 of how many in the legs are these interests 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.750
 without 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.690
 after I listen 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.340
 throw posted up to date pretty much about 4500 identify myself I'm taking notes 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.810
 otherwise I do not come back and German born when we find interesting projects 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.810
 to talk about it in a programming meeting 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.730
 no entity needs 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.340
 when the artists have models of the discs efforts and his models and his 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.580
 records and and that's where it's nice to present them 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.820
 you have to have a video of course 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.450
 a good game of photos of mine it does not eat bread certainly it's not bad 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.610
 to talk about photos 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.440
 % and to have 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.440
 for me today I think we need a new approach 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.060
 2 at least existed between them and certainly not enough to not have to 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.440
 as long as we already know 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.540
 it's like saying ah but I'm glad I'm not on a radio 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.170
 ben is safe a site 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.460
 it is useless and the sites that I would rather call sites 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.260
 today died a little more beautiful besides the movie person in the world who has 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.620
 a guitar has almost its space 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.230
 the cgt no longer serves any purpose must decide all the sites much more 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.120
 sharp so much more 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.500
 tempo 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.320
 and know that I look a little life life or help artists from 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.979
 artists no life brief 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.759
 it's really not reassuring for a programmer that we say hello 

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:15.249
 queen rania so how are they going to communicate on the gold 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:17.979
 their boat committee on their tour 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:20.979
 so I look at luck also 

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:25.049
 very regularly 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.049
 - in the earpiece for example this sentence into pieces 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.759
 so she sent me her pill against the future 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:33.759
 that's why in a small bag if you want with 1 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.719
 a little video that looks exactly like it prescribed psion of 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:40.509
 drugs 16 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:43.399
 drug packages to pass at this time and after you can in 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:46.269
 date indeed swallow this pill against the future 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.359
 which is a beautiful city 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.199
 USB key 

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:53.989
 and so you can go love you after when you go on the internet it's afp 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.409
 the way of a train on the web 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.069
 it's really interesting because she's in a panel of things 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.909
 interesting 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.529
 so that's my part of its reserves so it's programmed this young 

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:03.140
 women 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.169
 percent talking about it around me so she gives me 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:08.219
 some pills 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:11.279
 and when the van of the professionals interested d enfidha of the logo for the 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:11.979
 future 

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:14.979
 we call it on the part of reconstruction 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:22.059
 oh well it depends also we take the Parisian territory 

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:26.979
 Swiss side knows the best% and obviously there has been some jt 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:29.889
 adapted it's easy to say and sometimes it's a lot less easy to 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.349
 do it because it's just a bit of everything and even a room 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.269
 but there is a crescendo way of doing very often we start like 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.809
 in the Bahamas and in small places like that if you're a little bit more 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:41.799
 tons of gold ground we can indeed started in places a little bit 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.319
 more 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.049
 independent blue-white-red 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.329
 on the other hand you that this year again it may be that some evenings 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.570
 poetry and so on 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.939
 so there were there are dies and little by little in the watches 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:55.659
 people in teeth the places a little longer 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:58.459
 after Paris is true that it's important to play it was the moment he 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:03:59.840
 there are so many concerts every night 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.759
 m play a little north west of caen now everywhere 

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:06.119
 but my capital that went into paying gigs 

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:09.399
 and little public nasty kim mounted in theaters 

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:12.039
 it was nice to say but rather a hyphen would tell us between all 

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:15.129
 small cafes and places of the small places that exist worse places a little more 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.280
 great they will do a little later but for that we must admit to pass 

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.689
 by the models passed by bigger saline with a little bit of 

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:21.590
 Ticketing 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.659
 and percent and builds his career like that 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:25.789
 it takes a few years each time 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:27.710
 the resume 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.480
 must be patient and emotion and what
