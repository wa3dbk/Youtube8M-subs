bat<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.060> figured<00:01:57.390> he<00:01:57.540> may<00:01:57.689> want<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.960> go<00:01:58.079> a

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
bat so I figured he may want to go a

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.649 
bat so I figured he may want to go a
tyranitar<00:01:58.860> battery<00:01:59.790> could<00:02:00.030> go<00:02:00.119> off<00:02:00.210> air<00:02:00.390> horn

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
tyranitar battery could go off air horn

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.929 
tyranitar battery could go off air horn
sounds<00:02:00.719> like<00:02:01.020> okay<00:02:01.369> let's<00:02:02.369> make<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.729> really

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
sounds like okay let's make the really

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.510 
sounds like okay let's make the really
dumb<00:02:03.180> play<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.540> going<00:02:03.810> with<00:02:03.930> Lucario<00:02:04.469> like<00:02:05.250> I

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
dumb play of going with Lucario like I

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.570 
dumb play of going with Lucario like I
mean<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.869> made<00:02:07.259> sense<00:02:07.560> looking<00:02:08.009> at<00:02:08.160> his<00:02:08.280> team

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
mean it made sense looking at his team

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.360 
mean it made sense looking at his team
but<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.899> know<00:02:10.050> we'll<00:02:10.560> see<00:02:10.590> where<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.099> gets<00:02:11.190> us

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
but you know we'll see where it gets us

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.770 
but you know we'll see where it gets us
so<00:02:11.610> let's<00:02:11.790> get<00:02:12.000> into<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:12.270> awesome<00:02:12.569> on<00:02:12.690> the

other<00:02:12.959> side

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
other side

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.180

does help make Trevin a lot easier to
deal<00:02:49.910> with<00:02:49.940> I<00:02:50.470> mean<00:02:51.470> it's<00:02:51.650> not<00:02:51.769> like<00:02:51.829> it's

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010

gonna help that much but better than
nothing<00:02:53.750> right<00:02:53.959> but<00:02:54.290> I<00:02:54.319> at<00:02:54.530> least<00:02:54.560> learned

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
nothing right but I at least learned

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.339 
nothing right but I at least learned
that<00:02:55.489> his<00:02:55.730> status<00:02:56.209> is<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.810> willow<00:02:57.079> asst

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
that his status is the willow asst

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.800 
that his status is the willow asst
because<00:02:57.709> I<00:02:57.890> mean<00:02:58.519> they<00:02:58.879> can<00:02:59.180> carry<00:02:59.480> dual

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
because I mean they can carry dual

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.869 
because I mean they can carry dual
status<00:03:00.140> but<00:03:00.530> they<00:03:00.620> generally<00:03:00.799> don't<00:03:01.370> in<00:03:01.640> favor

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
status but they generally don't in favor

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.839 
status but they generally don't in favor
of<00:03:02.000> having<00:03:02.150> that<00:03:02.360> wheat<00:03:02.660> seed<00:03:03.129> so<00:03:04.129> here<00:03:04.610> I'm

why I brought in the fair floor in the
first<00:06:17.630> place<00:06:17.810> just<00:06:18.560> gonna<00:06:18.710> take<00:06:18.919> out<00:06:19.099> the

talent<00:06:19.639> plane<00:06:19.880> with<00:06:20.060> extreme<00:06:20.419> speed<00:06:20.690> because

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
talent plane with extreme speed because

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.390

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:09.620 
GG guy it was fun tyranitar hacks is a

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.130 
GG guy it was fun tyranitar hacks is a
little<00:07:09.950> bit<00:07:10.070> of<00:07:10.190> stuff<00:07:10.430> but<00:07:10.870> honestly<00:07:11.870> I<00:07:11.960> think

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:12.140 
little bit of stuff but honestly I think

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.510 
little bit of stuff but honestly I think
I<00:07:12.410> still<00:07:12.650> would<00:07:12.770> have<00:07:12.800> played<00:07:13.040> around<00:07:13.310> it

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 
I still would have played around it

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.950 
I still would have played around it
about<00:07:14.000> the<00:07:14.210> same<00:07:14.390> because<00:07:14.630> it<00:07:14.750> will<00:07:14.840> just

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:14.960 
about the same because it will just

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.690 
about the same because it will just
bring<00:07:15.110> it<00:07:15.230> pin<00:07:15.590> bringing<00:07:15.980> Lucario<00:07:16.430> I<00:07:16.460> didn't

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:16.700 
bring it pin bringing Lucario I didn't

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.860 
bring it pin bringing Lucario I didn't
know<00:07:16.760> his<00:07:16.880> item<00:07:17.270> I<00:07:17.360> was<00:07:17.450> thinking<00:07:17.720> it<00:07:17.840> might

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:17.870 
know his item I was thinking it might

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.920 
know his item I was thinking it might
have<00:07:18.110> been<00:07:18.170> choice<00:07:18.470> just<00:07:19.460> from<00:07:19.640> how<00:07:19.820> he<00:07:19.880> had<00:07:20.750> no

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:20.930 
have been choice just from how he had no

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.720 
have been choice just from how he had no
life<00:07:21.200> for<00:07:21.380> Bert<00:07:21.530> well<00:07:21.800> I<00:07:22.010> won't<00:07:22.370> have<00:07:22.430> seen<00:07:22.640> the

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:22.730 
life for Bert well I won't have seen the

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:24.670 
life for Bert well I won't have seen the
life<00:07:22.880> or<00:07:23.060> but<00:07:23.210> he<00:07:23.270> had<00:07:23.390> no<00:07:23.480> leftovers<00:07:24.020> he<00:07:24.530> could

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:24.680 
life or but he had no leftovers he could

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.140 
life or but he had no leftovers he could
have<00:07:24.740> been<00:07:24.860> resto<00:07:25.160> Chesto<00:07:25.640> or<00:07:25.880> he<00:07:25.970> could<00:07:26.120> have

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:26.150 
have been resto Chesto or he could have

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.540 
have been resto Chesto or he could have
been<00:07:26.300> like<00:07:26.390> lump<00:07:26.750> more<00:07:26.960> focused<00:07:27.440> ash<00:07:27.560> but<00:07:27.920> or

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:28.550 
been like lump more focused ash but or

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.750 
been like lump more focused ash but or
even<00:07:29.110> show<00:07:30.110> pool<00:07:30.350> but<00:07:30.590> I'm<00:07:31.250> gonna<00:07:31.430> kind<00:07:31.670> of

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:31.760 
even show pool but I'm gonna kind of

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.670 
even show pool but I'm gonna kind of
assume<00:07:32.060> not<00:07:32.630> but<00:07:32.960> I<00:07:33.050> probably<00:07:33.230> just<00:07:33.410> close

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.680 
assume not but I probably just close

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.470 
assume not but I probably just close
combat<00:07:33.890> and<00:07:34.280> then<00:07:34.460> just<00:07:34.670> done<00:07:34.940> the<00:07:34.970> ferrothorn

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:35.480 
combat and then just done the ferrothorn

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.110 
combat and then just done the ferrothorn
play<00:07:35.750> about<00:07:36.020> the<00:07:36.170> same<00:07:36.410> so<00:07:36.800> I<00:07:37.070> mean<00:07:37.940> that<00:07:38.030> would

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:38.120 
play about the same so I mean that would

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.340 
play about the same so I mean that would
have<00:07:38.210> been<00:07:38.270> really<00:07:38.330> the<00:07:38.660> only<00:07:38.840> differences

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:39.350 
have been really the only differences

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.260 
have been really the only differences
that<00:07:39.500> I<00:07:39.560> can<00:07:39.770> think<00:07:39.800> of<00:07:40.100> but<00:07:40.400> otherwise<00:07:40.790> it

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:41.270 
that I can think of but otherwise it

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.190 
that I can think of but otherwise it
probably<00:07:41.570> would've<00:07:41.720> played<00:07:41.840> out<00:07:41.960> the<00:07:42.050> same

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:42.200 
probably would've played out the same
