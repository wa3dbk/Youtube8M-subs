00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
October closely full of light for I'd

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:02.290

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.549 

yeah<00:01:03.300> well<00:01:03.480> chunky<00:01:03.899> was<00:01:04.019> probably<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
yeah well chunky was probably the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.139 
yeah well chunky was probably the
biggest<00:01:04.769> bus<00:01:05.100> because<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.700> was<00:01:05.790> my<00:01:05.939> first

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 
biggest bus because it was my first

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:07.789 
biggest bus because it was my first
fault<00:01:06.509> and<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.899> was<00:01:06.990> at<00:01:07.110> height<00:01:07.320> Lee<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.740> I

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
fault and I was at height Lee and I

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.200 
fault and I was at height Lee and I
didn't<00:01:08.070> think<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.369> was<00:01:08.490> going<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.670> catch<00:01:08.909> and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
didn't think I was going to catch and

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.999 
didn't think I was going to catch and
stuff<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:10.350> yeah<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.649> was<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> most

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
stuff so yeah that was the most

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.399 
stuff so yeah that was the most
exhilarating<00:01:11.460> at<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.119> time<00:01:12.330> just<00:01:12.990> just

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
exhilarating at the time just just

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.690 
exhilarating at the time just just
purely<00:01:13.680> because<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.950> didn't<00:01:14.189> believe<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.549> was

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
purely because I didn't believe I was

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.279 
purely because I didn't believe I was
capable<00:01:15.649> but<00:01:16.649> other<00:01:16.830> than<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.790> client

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
capable but other than that the client

particularly searched out the dirtier
machia<00:04:03.650> spots<00:04:04.069> you<00:04:04.730> know<00:04:04.849> if<00:04:04.909> you're<00:04:05.000> than

always done mean the bites

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.659 
always done mean the bites
yeah<00:04:14.840> I<00:04:14.930> can't<00:04:15.260> think<00:04:15.349> of<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:16.009> only<00:04:16.340> instance

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
yeah I can't think of the only instance

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.430 
yeah I can't think of the only instance
of<00:04:16.789> fishing<00:04:17.120> in<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.329> dirt<00:04:17.539> sorry<00:04:17.870> bits<00:04:18.229> and

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.580 
that wade and there are Chilean that way
it<00:04:25.520> gets<00:04:25.669> picked<00:04:25.849> up<00:04:26.110> much<00:04:27.110> quicker<00:04:27.349> than<00:04:27.530> it

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
it gets picked up much quicker than it

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:01.659 
top of the burger so caching that there

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:04.589 
top of the burger so caching that there
would<00:05:01.840> have<00:05:01.870> meant<00:05:02.110> nothing<00:05:02.499> to<00:05:02.529> me<00:05:03.479> but<00:05:04.479> at

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599 
would have meant nothing to me but at

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:06.899 
would have meant nothing to me but at
the<00:05:04.659> same<00:05:04.870> time<00:05:05.169> if<00:05:05.949> I<00:05:06.129> could<00:05:06.189> get<00:05:06.460> a<00:05:06.490> sneaky

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:06.909 
the same time if I could get a sneaky

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:08.730 
the same time if I could get a sneaky
sight<00:05:07.090> cast<00:05:07.479> down<00:05:07.719> from<00:05:07.930> the<00:05:08.020> nearest<00:05:08.319> swim

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
sight cast down from the nearest swim

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.379 
sight cast down from the nearest swim
and<00:05:09.669> into<00:05:09.999> there

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
and into there

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.239 
and into there
then<00:05:10.990> I<00:05:11.110> would<00:05:11.229> say<00:05:11.379> that's<00:05:11.590> good<00:05:11.740> angling<00:05:12.159> you

00:05:12.239 --> 00:05:12.249 
then I would say that's good angling you

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:13.860 
then I would say that's good angling you
know<00:05:12.400> and<00:05:12.520> it<00:05:12.610> would<00:05:12.729> be<00:05:12.849> sort<00:05:13.240> of<00:05:13.330> cast<00:05:13.689> a

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
know and it would be sort of cast a

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.260 
know and it would be sort of cast a
stroke<00:05:14.139> put<00:05:14.379> in<00:05:14.500> maybe<00:05:14.650> you<00:05:14.949> know<00:05:15.069> but<00:05:15.729> yeah<00:05:16.240> I

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
stroke put in maybe you know but yeah I

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.740 
stroke put in maybe you know but yeah I
think<00:05:16.330> there's<00:05:16.629> a<00:05:16.659> fine<00:05:16.900> line<00:05:18.210> if<00:05:19.210> you're<00:05:19.389> if

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
think there's a fine line if you're if

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.140 
think there's a fine line if you're if
you're<00:05:20.020> doing<00:05:20.439> something<00:05:20.979> that<00:05:21.669> no<00:05:21.879> one<00:05:22.029> else

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
you're doing something that no one else

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.700 
you're doing something that no one else
is<00:05:22.509> allowed<00:05:23.500> to<00:05:23.830> do<00:05:24.840> then<00:05:25.840> yeah<00:05:26.409> you<00:05:26.469> could

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
is allowed to do then yeah you could

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.309 
is allowed to do then yeah you could
stroke<00:05:27.250> put<00:05:27.430> it<00:05:27.550> but<00:05:28.210> it<00:05:28.750> just<00:05:28.930> depends

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 
stroke put it but it just depends

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:30.749 
stroke put it but it just depends
doesn't<00:05:29.560> it<00:05:29.800> you<00:05:29.919> know<00:05:30.069> if<00:05:30.490> you're<00:05:30.639> not

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759 
doesn't it you know if you're not

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:32.010 
doesn't it you know if you're not
allowed<00:05:30.909> target<00:05:31.330> outs<00:05:31.479> and<00:05:31.629> you've<00:05:31.750> got<00:05:31.900> one

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
allowed target outs and you've got one

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.779 
allowed target outs and you've got one
on<00:05:32.139> you<00:05:32.289> catch<00:05:32.469> one<00:05:32.710> so<00:05:32.919> what<00:05:33.129> that's<00:05:33.490> I

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:33.789 
on you catch one so what that's I

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:35.579 
on you catch one so what that's I
wouldn't<00:05:34.419> I<00:05:34.629> wouldn't<00:05:35.110> think<00:05:35.259> twice<00:05:35.439> about

00:05:35.579 --> 00:05:35.589 
wouldn't I wouldn't think twice about

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:39.059 
wouldn't I wouldn't think twice about
that<00:05:36.000> and<00:05:37.000> in<00:05:37.839> the<00:05:37.960> past<00:05:38.229> I<00:05:38.439> have<00:05:38.620> night<00:05:38.860> fish

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:39.069 
that and in the past I have night fish

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:41.159 
that and in the past I have night fish
waters<00:05:39.430> which<00:05:39.610> I'll<00:05:39.819> buy<00:05:40.029> only<00:05:40.419> and<00:05:40.659> that<00:05:40.689> is

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
waters which I'll buy only and that is

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:42.749 
waters which I'll buy only and that is
definitely<00:05:41.680> cheating<00:05:42.039> but<00:05:42.400> I'll<00:05:42.550> still

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:42.759 
definitely cheating but I'll still

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:53.970 
definitely cheating but I'll still
enjoyed<00:05:42.999> it

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:53.980 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.040 

you
