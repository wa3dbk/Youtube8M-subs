this model is really a beast but our

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:42.710 
this model is really a beast but our
delivery<00:02:36.690> is<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.440> little<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:39.090> it's<00:02:39.900> just<00:02:41.720> so

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720

punchy<00:02:43.410> it's<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:43.830> violent<00:02:44.190> it's<00:02:44.690> fantastic

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
punchy it's so violent it's fantastic

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.560 
punchy it's so violent it's fantastic
I<00:02:45.870> mean<00:02:46.080> gonna<00:02:46.770> hit<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.070> sport<00:02:47.370> button<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:48.210> it

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
I mean gonna hit the sport button and it

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.140 
I mean gonna hit the sport button and it
just<00:02:48.930> takes<00:02:49.140> on<00:02:49.350> a<00:02:49.380> whole<00:02:49.470> different<00:02:49.740> edge<00:02:50.400> but

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.420 
because you know there's so much power
on<00:03:02.130> tap<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:06.690> r8<00:03:07.080> that<00:03:07.440> amia<00:03:07.800> was<00:03:08.040> driving

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
on tap the r8 that amia was driving

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.490 
on tap the r8 that amia was driving
wasn't<00:03:08.790> as<00:03:08.940> powerful<00:03:09.240> at<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.870> way<00:03:10.020> 10-plus

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
wasn't as powerful at the way 10-plus

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.270 
wasn't as powerful at the way 10-plus
but<00:03:11.370> with<00:03:11.520> its<00:03:11.670> 0-200<00:03:12.510> time<00:03:12.750> of<00:03:12.990> 3.6<00:03:13.890> seconds

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
but with its 0-200 time of 3.6 seconds

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.900 
but with its 0-200 time of 3.6 seconds
and<00:03:14.520> a<00:03:14.790> top<00:03:14.820> speed<00:03:15.000> of<00:03:15.470> 314<00:03:16.470> it<00:03:16.980> was<00:03:17.340> still<00:03:17.700> a

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
and a top speed of 314 it was still a

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.460 
and a top speed of 314 it was still a
very<00:03:18.300> explosive<00:03:19.160> performance<00:03:20.160> package<00:03:21.380> so<00:03:22.380> it

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
very explosive performance package so it

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.470 
very explosive performance package so it
really<00:03:22.890> was<00:03:23.160> a<00:03:23.190> pleasant<00:03:23.459> surprise<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.300> see

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
really was a pleasant surprise to see

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.720 
really was a pleasant surprise to see
that<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.900> r8<00:03:25.260> was<00:03:25.560> just<00:03:25.890> breezing<00:03:26.310> through

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
that the r8 was just breezing through

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
that the r8 was just breezing through
the<00:03:27.030> city

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.890 

the<00:03:32.500> engine<00:03:32.980> has<00:03:33.130> come<00:03:33.400> and<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:34.360> new<00:03:34.600> gearbox

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
the engine has come and the new gearbox

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.560 
the engine has come and the new gearbox
is<00:03:35.380> very<00:03:35.440> smooth<00:03:36.340> it's<00:03:36.610> only<00:03:36.970> when<00:03:37.300> it<00:03:37.420> was

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
is very smooth it's only when it was

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.510 
is very smooth it's only when it was
suddenly<00:03:38.080> on<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.380> bar<00:03:38.560> there's<00:03:38.800> a<00:03:38.860> small<00:03:39.160> jerk

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
suddenly on the bar there's a small jerk

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.040 
suddenly on the bar there's a small jerk
from<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:39.790> gearbox<00:03:40.030> otherwise<00:03:40.600> there<00:03:40.840> are<00:03:40.870> no

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
from the gearbox otherwise there are no

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.150 
from the gearbox otherwise there are no
problems<00:03:41.470> at<00:03:41.590> all<00:03:43.350> so<00:03:44.350> the<00:03:44.710> are<00:03:44.950> its

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
problems at all so the are its

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.490 
problems at all so the are its
modern-day<00:03:45.760> supercar<00:03:46.540> credentials<00:03:47.140> were

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
modern-day supercar credentials were

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:58.270 
modern-day supercar credentials were
only<00:03:47.830> getting<00:03:48.190> stronger

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.280 

now<00:03:58.880> let's<00:03:59.090> change<00:03:59.240> gears<00:03:59.540> let's<00:03:59.900> talk<00:04:00.110> about

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
now let's change gears let's talk about

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.980 
now let's change gears let's talk about
please<00:04:00.800> like<00:04:01.160> how<00:04:01.820> it<00:04:02.060> feels<00:04:02.330> to<00:04:02.450> drive<00:04:02.600> so

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
please like how it feels to drive so

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.530 
please like how it feels to drive so
I'll<00:04:03.110> focus<00:04:03.350> obviously<00:04:03.740> on<00:04:04.490> the<00:04:04.730> handling<00:04:05.150> the

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
I'll focus obviously on the handling the

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.340 
I'll focus obviously on the handling the
steering<00:04:06.080> the<00:04:06.440> grip<00:04:06.740> and<00:04:07.600> see<00:04:08.600> how<00:04:08.720> the<00:04:08.780> super

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
steering the grip and see how the super

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.410 
steering the grip and see how the super

weight<00:04:57.000> to<00:04:57.030> it<00:04:58.130> good<00:04:59.130> feedback<00:04:59.760> very<00:05:00.120> good<00:05:00.420> and

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
weight to it good feedback very good and

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.790 
weight to it good feedback very good and
there's<00:05:01.620> really<00:05:01.980> don't<00:05:02.610> lose<00:05:02.880> your<00:05:03.150> grip<00:05:03.480> and

there's really don't lose your grip and

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.170 
there's really don't lose your grip and
of<00:05:04.800> course<00:05:05.010> you<00:05:05.130> have<00:05:05.280> Quattro<00:05:05.760> four-wheel

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
of course you have Quattro four-wheel

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.740 
of course you have Quattro four-wheel
drive<00:05:06.420> so<00:05:06.690> you<00:05:07.020> can<00:05:07.910> slip<00:05:08.910> up<00:05:09.150> and<00:05:09.270> still<00:05:09.570> get

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
drive so you can slip up and still get

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.420 
drive so you can slip up and still get
away<00:05:09.780> with<00:05:10.230> it<00:05:10.380> you<00:05:10.500> know<00:05:10.620> I<00:05:10.830> mean<00:05:11.250> do<00:05:11.370> you

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
away with it you know I mean do you

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.530 
away with it you know I mean do you
think<00:05:11.490> you've<00:05:11.730> been<00:05:11.880> taught<00:05:12.060> more<00:05:12.240> than<00:05:12.300> you

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
think you've been taught more than you

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.560

can<00:05:12.720> chew<00:05:13.400> using<00:05:14.400> the<00:05:14.520> r8<00:05:14.850> out<00:05:15.060> on<00:05:15.210> public

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
can chew using the r8 out on public

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.270 
can chew using the r8 out on public
roads<00:05:15.810> because<00:05:16.320> the<00:05:16.470> ground<00:05:16.710> is<00:05:16.860> named<00:05:17.070> she

roads because the ground is named she

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.800 
roads because the ground is named she
must<00:05:17.460> be<00:05:17.580> a<00:05:17.610> bit<00:05:17.820> of<00:05:17.910> a<00:05:17.940> pain<00:05:18.150> better

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810
