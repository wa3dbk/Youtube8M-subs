00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.760
 six and a half pieces of sugar in this 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.580
 small bag 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.900
 this is similar to coca cola and 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.560
 It is expressly to the children 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.039
 advertised 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.680
 with the school marketing 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.240
 teaching materials sport sponsoring 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:37.399
 That's bad kids marketing 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:39.200
 So at least eight pieces are correct 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.180
 Sugar is in there and then it is 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.850
 Whole sweet sugar packed on 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.739
 hearts mug and this global 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.710
 spectacle in the mouth, it is easy 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.570
 unbelievable he says that it's okay 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.000
 if you give something from time to time 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.460
 special on so between especially 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.110
 a lot of sugar is already my favorite 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.420
 for the choice to the golden windbag is 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.809
 in any case monster cheek artist of 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.809
 sleeve 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.620
 funny fresh has a special one 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.930
 self obligation imposed no 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.820
 advertising for unbalanced foods 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.420
 to be addressed to children only for one product 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.310
 there should be an exception 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.900
 homberg potato chips are greasier 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.580
 and saltier than french fries from 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.530
 mcdonald's still finds funny-fresh 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.190
 It's perfectly okay for children 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.600
 market 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.990
 that is pretty brazen and 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.990
 mendacious 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.520
 breakfast cereal that could be so 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.980
 be healthy 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.710
 but this cosmos is here from nestlé 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.030
 the contained 25 percent sugar that 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.420
 you have to imagine 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.040
 they are as sweet as butter biscuits, though 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.140
 Mr Bersenbrücker, that it was the boss 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.670
 from nestlé who says his 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.680
 breakfast cereal design no 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.020
 sweets more 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.790
 that is a very bad thing 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.890
 consumer disappointment with it they contribute 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.710
 the danger of increasing excess weight of 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.780
 children with them should be ashamed 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.790
 you have the golden windbag for 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.000
 This breakfast cereal is truly 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.000
 earned 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.060
 I want that paula from dr oetker the 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.890
 Golden wind bag wins because I 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.050
 just as a mother is impossible find 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.790
 this on all channels to children 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.640
 first it is advertised this before the 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.220
 Eat on the internet on the iphone 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.720
 merchandise products and i want 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.720
