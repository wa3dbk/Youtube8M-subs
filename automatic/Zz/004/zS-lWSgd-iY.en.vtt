00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:16.020
 you feel i don't sing no let's all 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:17.580
 first, hello dear friends 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.340
 today we are in the central house 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.380
 artist in the Russian Art Week 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.990
 and we came here to find out what 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.990
 such abstract art go 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.050
 you understand pictures of course 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.360
 classic is an academic school it 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.320
 raffaello works and as you said 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.320
 raffaello 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.989
 instead of a thousand words did you know about 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.120
 competition program of this event 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:52.750
 I do not participate and how do you assess your chances 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:54.820
 to win and how much and where can we 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.949
 look at the real modern 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.449
 culture 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.910
 she and modern cultures more precisely 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:04.170
 extensive notion is mass culture is 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:07.360
 elite culture is what they call 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.610
 an artificially contemporary art that 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.659
 quite the same thing as from the time you 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.950
 said contemporary art 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.119
 modern boring okay we will cut this 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.119
 the moment is still not clear 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.900
 a decorative arts contest 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.970
 art is especially close to me because 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.430
 I graduated from the faculty 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.310
 decorative mathematics can 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.050
 say what abstraction is 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:39.290
 direction in painting 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:42.680
 when you just take paint inspired 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:47.210
 You fly in flight and that's something something already 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:51.280
 appears on the canvas I donâ€™t even know 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.280
 and I will be very ashamed now just 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.210
 not over perfect 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.720
 let's twist the drum more 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:09.649
 picture and or no remove these by the bar 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:13.010
 turn on the theme of our program humor it 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:23.720
 not about the club moment 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:29.350
 great good goal of ours all shoot 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:37.130
 yes tell us wrote oh come on 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:40.220
 tell us what you want i am submitting 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.640
 in this exhibition two works in absolutely 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.180
 different styles one called model 21 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.239
 century 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.180
 and the second picture is very dear to me because 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.880
 that I was born in this place is Crimea 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.330
 let's turn to the picture model 21 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.810
 century 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.360
 But many sculptors cast the first 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.680
 nude woman at 17 but friends 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.680
 say that in 14 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:13.740
 it is necessary that such an abstraction to 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:22.180
 Malevich where to find him 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:26.130
 this joey ramona organism is not at all 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:29.560
 understandable say that this culture form 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:34.120
 5 percent of the population and understand the percentage 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:37.630
 I hardly understand what is happening 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.730
 artists go mad a minute in a minute 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:45.220
 hour after hour the artists go crazy on 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:48.160
 this exhibition is still not rolling asked 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.420
 of course you can ask about the hat what kind of 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.390
 hats hat 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.180
 kapu bram called australian feathers 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.570
 I bought from Bedouins mail address will not excuse a 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:02.830
 This is a wedding ring 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:05.580
 here are 12 pomegranates talking about 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.880
 that my person is also our grenade 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.420
 so much to him we now have two if 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.370
 to connect 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.380
 and if you connect the two rings happen 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:17.870
 some kind of annihilation is necessarily like 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:24.680
 abstract art wear glasses glasses 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:24.680
 glasses to me purple they give 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.050
 so you take our business card 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:44.210
 First of all, do you think it is possible 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:44.210
 I find it difficult to vote for the picture 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.850
 what do you think abstraction 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:06.050
 abstractionism art direction what 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.340
 you are friends it was something called 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.290
