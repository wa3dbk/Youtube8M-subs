choosing<00:00:32.509> your<00:00:32.629> line<00:00:32.960> into<00:00:33.379> a<00:00:33.410> turn<00:00:33.680> brings

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
choosing your line into a turn brings

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.440 
choosing your line into a turn brings
together<00:00:34.280> your<00:00:34.730> cornering<00:00:35.090> and<00:00:35.360> braking

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
together your cornering and braking

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.450 
together your cornering and braking
technique<00:00:36.260> to<00:00:36.470> maintain<00:00:36.650> the<00:00:37.010> flow<00:00:37.280> of<00:00:37.309> a

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
technique to maintain the flow of a

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.180 
technique to maintain the flow of a
trail<00:00:37.989> the<00:00:38.989> goal<00:00:39.199> of<00:00:39.320> any<00:00:39.500> corner<00:00:39.890> is<00:00:39.980> to

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
trail the goal of any corner is to

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:49.299 
trail the goal of any corner is to
maximize<00:00:40.730> your<00:00:40.940> exit<00:00:41.300> speed<00:00:47.949> so<00:00:48.949> this<00:00:49.070> is<00:00:49.220> a

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
maximize your exit speed so this is a

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.130 
maximize your exit speed so this is a
pretty<00:00:49.519> basic<00:00:49.699> corner<00:00:50.210> you<00:00:50.690> can<00:00:50.870> see<00:00:51.019> that

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
pretty basic corner you can see that

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.600 
pretty basic corner you can see that
you've<00:00:51.260> got<00:00:51.350> like<00:00:51.470> a<00:00:51.500> pretty<00:00:51.800> wide<00:00:52.040> entrance

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
you've got like a pretty wide entrance

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.979 
you've got like a pretty wide entrance
where<00:00:52.730> you<00:00:52.790> can<00:00:52.940> pretty<00:00:53.180> much<00:00:53.239> use<00:00:53.329> your<00:00:53.809> line

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
where you can pretty much use your line

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.260 
where you can pretty much use your line
the<00:00:54.320> nice<00:00:54.530> run-in<00:00:55.010> with<00:00:55.520> the<00:00:55.700> epic<00:00:56.000> that<00:00:56.149> is

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
the nice run-in with the epic that is

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.970 
the nice run-in with the epic that is
simulated<00:00:56.840> by<00:00:56.960> your<00:00:57.110> tree<00:00:57.350> over<00:00:57.530> there<00:00:57.559> and<00:00:57.920> a

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
simulated by your tree over there and a

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.369 
simulated by your tree over there and a
nice<00:00:58.190> run<00:00:58.460> out<00:00:58.670> so<00:00:59.329> in<00:00:59.420> a<00:00:59.510> situation<00:00:59.690> like<00:01:00.200> this
