keynote that basically stem from
Google's<00:00:45.149> platform<00:00:45.989> android<00:00:46.440> now<00:00:47.010> they're

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
Google's platform android now they're

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.350 
Google's platform android now they're
really<00:00:47.309> two<00:00:47.489> reasons<00:00:47.520> for<00:00:47.910> making<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.210> video

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
really two reasons for making this video

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.060 
really two reasons for making this video
number<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.989> one<00:00:49.170> if<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.469> guys<00:00:49.590> watch<00:00:49.829> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
number of one if you guys watch the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.439 
number of one if you guys watch the
press<00:00:50.280> conference<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.760> know<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.090> Apple

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
press conference you know that Apple

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.900 
press conference you know that Apple
took<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:52.230> many<00:00:52.440> shots<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:53.070> Android<00:00:53.460> today<00:00:53.699> it

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
took so many shots in Android today it

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.090 
took so many shots in Android today it
was<00:00:54.030> actually<00:00:54.600> quite<00:00:54.719> funny<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.739> second

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
was actually quite funny and the second

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.250 
was actually quite funny and the second
reason<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.489> just<00:00:56.670> because<00:00:57.140> just<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.230> that

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
reason is just because just so that

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.750 
reason is just because just so that
people<00:00:58.590> know<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.770> many<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.430> these<00:00:59.520> features

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
people know that many of these features

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.670 
people know that many of these features
aren't<00:01:00.180> technically<00:01:00.780> new<00:01:01.020> even<00:01:01.410> though<00:01:01.530> they

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
aren't technically new even though they

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.770 
aren't technically new even though they
are<00:01:01.859> still<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.670> different<00:01:03.059> form<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.270> innovation

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
are still a different form of innovation

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.479 
are still a different form of innovation
because<00:01:03.899> they<00:01:04.199> are<00:01:04.409> grabbing<00:01:04.860> these<00:01:05.159> features

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
because they are grabbing these features

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.280 
because they are grabbing these features
and<00:01:05.519> making<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:05.970> their<00:01:06.150> own<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.570> with<00:01:07.170> that

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
and making it their own and with that

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.270 
and making it their own and with that

but<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:39.270> core<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.470> application<00:01:41.220> is

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
but the core of the application is

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.920 
but the core of the application is
basically<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.939> same<00:01:42.180> as<00:01:42.240> we've<00:01:42.600> been<00:01:42.630> seeing

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
basically the same as we've been seeing

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.560 
basically the same as we've been seeing
over<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.259> years<00:01:43.530> it's<00:01:43.799> predictive<00:01:44.579> text<00:01:45.060> for

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
over the years it's predictive text for

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.660 
over the years it's predictive text for
whatever<00:01:46.320> you're<00:01:46.500> typing<00:01:46.860> but<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.310> spin<00:01:47.549> that

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
whatever you're typing but the spin that

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.889 
whatever you're typing but the spin that
they're<00:01:47.820> putting<00:01:48.119> on<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.810> can

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
they're putting on it is that it can

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.660 
they're putting on it is that it can
actually<00:01:49.079> predict<00:01:50.040> what<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.399> are<00:01:50.520> actually

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
actually predict what you are actually

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.940 
actually predict what you are actually
going<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.149> say<00:01:51.390> by<00:01:51.689> basically<00:01:52.409> monitoring

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
going to say by basically monitoring

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.149 
going to say by basically monitoring
your<00:01:53.399> conversation<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.770> getting<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.860> feel<00:01:56.100> for

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
your conversation and getting a feel for

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.340 
your conversation and getting a feel for
the<00:01:56.670> type<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:56.909> language<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.990> use<00:01:58.020> with

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
the type of language that you use with

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.749 
the type of language that you use with
different<00:01:58.680> people<00:01:59.009> they<00:01:59.280> can<00:01:59.430> actually

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
different people they can actually

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.190 
different people they can actually
finish<00:02:00.000> sentences<00:02:00.299> for<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:00.960> that's<00:02:01.020> the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
finish sentences for you and that's the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.840 
finish sentences for you and that's the
way<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.590> differs<00:02:01.950> from<00:02:02.399> just<00:02:02.700> your

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
way that it differs from just your

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.240 
way that it differs from just your

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
developers now at number two this is a

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.770 
developers now at number two this is a
feature<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:52.799> I<00:02:52.950> know<00:02:53.069> a<00:02:53.220> lot<00:02:53.610> of<00:02:53.670> iOS<00:02:54.360> users

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
feature that I know a lot of iOS users

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.900 
feature that I know a lot of iOS users
really<00:02:55.110> wanted<00:02:55.680> on<00:02:55.860> their<00:02:56.370> phones<00:02:56.610> and<00:02:56.849> they

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
really wanted on their phones and they

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.670 
really wanted on their phones and they
actually<00:02:57.060> went<00:02:57.420> through<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.900> hassle<00:02:58.380> of

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
actually went through the hassle of

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.110 
actually went through the hassle of
jailbreaking<00:02:59.130> their<00:02:59.310> phone<00:02:59.459> so<00:02:59.670> they<00:02:59.849> can<00:03:00.000> get

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
jailbreaking their phone so they can get

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.420 
jailbreaking their phone so they can get
