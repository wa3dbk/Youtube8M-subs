open and close doors so if you can see

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.750 
open and close doors so if you can see
there's<00:00:16.529> pressure<00:00:16.770> plates<00:00:17.039> on<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.279> ground<00:00:17.490> as

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
there's pressure plates on the ground as

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.410 
there's pressure plates on the ground as
I<00:00:18.570> walk<00:00:18.810> through<00:00:18.840> here<00:00:19.199> they<00:00:19.859> open<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.850> then

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
I walk through here they open and then

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.500 
I walk through here they open and then
they<00:00:21.570> close<00:00:21.750> behind<00:00:21.990> me<00:00:23.240> works<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.390> either

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
they close behind me works in either

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.929 
they close behind me works in either
direction<00:00:27.170> now<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.590> one<00:00:28.740> right<00:00:28.920> there<00:00:29.279> the

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
direction now that one right there the

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.730 
direction now that one right there the
way<00:00:30.060> this<00:00:30.179> works<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.960> sticky<00:00:31.349> pistons

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
way this works is the sticky pistons

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.850 
way this works is the sticky pistons
back<00:00:31.920> behind<00:00:32.099> reinforced<00:00:32.759> glass<00:00:33.710> let<00:00:34.710> me

their frame is doing it with what's
called<00:01:12.060> frame<00:01:12.420> motors<00:01:12.780> but<00:01:13.049> it's<00:01:13.140> part<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.439> the

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
called frame motors but it's part of the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.399 
called frame motors but it's part of the
believe<00:01:15.390> it's<00:01:15.540> part<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.869> red<00:01:15.990> power<00:01:16.229> to

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
believe it's part of the red power to

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.070 
believe it's part of the red power to
model<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:17.040> but<00:01:17.280> I'm<00:01:17.369> not<00:01:17.400> sure<00:01:17.750> anyway<00:01:18.750> let<00:01:19.020> me

go ahead push up and now you see it
going<00:01:21.119> back<00:01:21.299> up<00:01:21.950> anyway<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.100> video<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.700> all

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
going back up anyway this video is all

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.640 
going back up anyway this video is all
about<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.270> toggle<00:01:24.659> latch<00:01:24.840> it's<00:01:25.290> right<00:01:25.470> here

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
about the toggle latch it's right here

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.819 
about the toggle latch it's right here
in<00:01:25.740> front<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.979> me<00:01:26.040> that's<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.340> right<00:01:26.460> there<00:01:27.829> but

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
in front of me that's it right there but

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.859 
in front of me that's it right there but
basically<00:01:29.040> what<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.400> does<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.939> takes<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.450> a

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
basically what it does it takes a a

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.920 
basically what it does it takes a a
pulse<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.770> uses<00:01:32.549> its<00:01:32.759> change<00:01:33.119> states<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.900> the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
pulse and uses its change states of the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.810 
pulse and uses its change states of the
output<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:34.680> there's<00:01:34.890> one<00:01:35.100> input<00:01:35.280> that's<00:01:35.670> it

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
output so there's one input that's it

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.260 
output so there's one input that's it
right<00:01:35.970> here<00:01:36.350> it's<00:01:37.350> connected<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.159> button

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
right here it's connected to this button

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.359 
right here it's connected to this button
every<00:01:40.020> time<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.289> push<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:40.829> button<00:01:40.890> these

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
every time I push this button these

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.550 
every time I push this button these
things<00:01:41.640> change<00:01:42.149> state<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.719> see<00:01:42.929> as<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.409> can

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
things change state so I see as you can

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.639 
things change state so I see as you can
see<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.920> side<00:01:44.130> on<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.399> Left<00:01:44.609> turned<00:01:44.909> on<00:01:45.119> now

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
see the side on the Left turned on now

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.819 
see the side on the Left turned on now
cited<00:01:46.649> on<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.799> right<00:01:46.979> Soph<00:01:48.350> now<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.409> side<00:01:49.799> of

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:55.700 
this off and the right side is on and so
the<00:01:54.569> reason<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:54.929> called<00:01:55.109> the<00:01:55.200> toggle<00:01:55.530> laughs

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
the reason is called the toggle laughs

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.649 
the reason is called the toggle laughs
because<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.340> outputs<00:01:56.700> toggle<00:01:57.119> first<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.569> all

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
because the outputs toggle first of all

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.080 
because the outputs toggle first of all
but<00:01:57.990> it's<00:01:58.110> called<00:01:58.289> a<00:01:58.380> latch<00:01:58.590> because<00:01:59.189> you're

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
but it's called a latch because you're

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.999 
but it's called a latch because you're
given<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.479> momentary<00:02:00.959> signal<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.679> push<00:02:01.890> the

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
given a momentary signal you push the

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.639 
given a momentary signal you push the
button<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:03.360> wires<00:02:03.569> only<00:02:03.959> energized<00:02:04.380> for

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
button and the wires only energized for

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.410 
button and the wires only energized for
a<00:02:04.709> moment<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.189> that's<00:02:05.429> why<00:02:05.579> this<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.939> actually

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
a moment so that's why this is actually

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.460 
a moment so that's why this is actually
called<00:02:06.539> a<00:02:06.659> momentary<00:02:07.110> switch<00:02:09.470> technically

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
called a momentary switch technically

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.449 
called a momentary switch technically
that's<00:02:10.590> what<00:02:10.709> it's<00:02:10.920> called<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.310> real

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
that's what it's called in the real

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.380 
that's what it's called in the real
world<00:02:11.670> but<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:13.220> toggle<00:02:14.220> that's<00:02:14.549> will<00:02:14.790> latch<00:02:15.030> and

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
world but I toggle that's will latch and

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.780 
world but I toggle that's will latch and
remember<00:02:15.900> that<00:02:16.049> momentary<00:02:16.620> state<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.340> when

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
remember that momentary state so when

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.630 
remember that momentary state so when
you<00:02:17.880> push<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.150> button<00:02:19.549> cycles<00:02:20.549> now<00:02:22.640> the

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
you push the button cycles now the

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.589 
you push the button cycles now the
output<00:02:24.060> here<00:02:24.299> is<00:02:24.450> tied<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:27.060> pistons<00:02:27.450> on

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
output here is tied to the pistons on

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.930 
output here is tied to the pistons on
the<00:02:27.690> top<00:02:27.930> right<00:02:28.200> here<00:02:28.590> you<00:02:28.829> can<00:02:28.980> see<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.160> wire

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
the top right here you can see the wire

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.120 
the top right here you can see the wire
going<00:02:30.269> across<00:02:30.510> if<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.380> can<00:02:31.500> get<00:02:31.560> in<00:02:31.709> there<00:02:31.860> yeah

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
going across if I can get in there yeah

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.319 
going across if I can get in there yeah
there<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.340> go<00:02:32.400> you<00:02:32.579> see<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.880> wires<00:02:33.060> going

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
there you go you see the wires going

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.839 
there you go you see the wires going
across<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.720> Pistons<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:35.160> wire<00:02:35.340> also<00:02:35.700> go

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
across the Pistons and the wire also go

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.140 
across the Pistons and the wire also go
straight<00:02:36.329> down<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:37.590> powers<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.549> Pistons

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
straight down and powers the Pistons

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.449 
straight down and powers the Pistons
from<00:02:39.329> below<00:02:39.599> to<00:02:39.709> now<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:40.739> went<00:02:40.980> ahead<00:02:41.099> and<00:02:41.310> put

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
from below to now I went ahead and put

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:42.800 
from below to now I went ahead and put
this<00:02:41.549> light<00:02:41.819> here<00:02:42.120> it's<00:02:42.299> just<00:02:42.360> temporary

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
this light here it's just temporary

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.509 
this light here it's just temporary
actually<00:02:43.350> dropped<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:43.739> out<00:02:43.859> of<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.040> hole<00:02:44.220> but

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
actually dropped it out of the hole but

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.220 
actually dropped it out of the hole but
this<00:02:44.850> is<00:02:45.060> just<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.389> show<00:02:45.420> you<00:02:45.630> that<00:02:45.750> this<00:02:46.019> thing

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
this is just to show you that this thing

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.090 
this is just to show you that this thing
can<00:02:46.410> be<00:02:46.470> used<00:02:46.920> for<00:02:47.040> light<00:02:47.700> switches<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.329> so

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
can be used for light switches to so

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.199 
can be used for light switches to so
every<00:02:50.100> time<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.310> hit<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.639> button<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:51.060> light

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
every time I hit the button of light

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.710 
every time I hit the button of light
toggles<00:02:51.690> from<00:02:51.870> off<00:02:52.019> to<00:02:52.049> on<00:02:52.940> so<00:02:53.940> these<00:02:54.269> push

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
toggles from off to on so these push

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.240 
toggles from off to on so these push
bugs<00:02:54.959> they<00:02:55.109> look<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.350> lot<00:02:55.500> more<00:02:55.560> elegant<00:02:56.160> than

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
bugs they look a lot more elegant than

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.610 
bugs they look a lot more elegant than
the<00:02:56.519> lever<00:02:56.910> so<00:02:57.269> if<00:02:57.359> you<00:02:57.450> kind<00:02:57.630> of<00:02:57.750> want<00:02:58.440> your

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
the lever so if you kind of want your

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.990 
the lever so if you kind of want your
stuff<00:02:58.799> to<00:02:58.950> look<00:02:59.069> better<00:02:59.340> I<00:02:59.430> like<00:02:59.670> to<00:02:59.790> push

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
stuff to look better I like to push

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.490 
stuff to look better I like to push
button<00:03:00.329> better<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:01.760> that's<00:03:02.760> pretty<00:03:03.209> cool

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
button better and that's pretty cool

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.920 
button better and that's pretty cool
alternately<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:04.590> can<00:03:04.950> use<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.630> pressure<00:03:06.630> plate

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
alternately you can use a pressure plate

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.229 
alternately you can use a pressure plate
whatever<00:03:07.440> like<00:03:08.250> if<00:03:08.459> you're<00:03:08.639> somebody<00:03:08.819> steps

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
whatever like if you're somebody steps

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.490 
whatever like if you're somebody steps
in<00:03:09.329> the<00:03:09.389> hallway<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:09.810> with<00:03:10.049> the<00:03:10.139> lights<00:03:10.349> to

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
in the hallway and with the lights to

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.860 
in the hallway and with the lights to
come<00:03:10.560> on<00:03:10.790> not<00:03:11.790> actually<00:03:12.209> pretty<00:03:12.420> cool<00:03:12.660> a

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
come on not actually pretty cool a

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.210 
come on not actually pretty cool a
hallway<00:03:13.200> just<00:03:13.380> put<00:03:13.739> a<00:03:13.769> couple<00:03:13.980> pressure

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
hallway just put a couple pressure

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.710 
hallway just put a couple pressure
plates<00:03:14.549> on<00:03:14.700> either<00:03:14.849> end<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.299> it<00:03:15.450> will<00:03:15.569> toggle

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
plates on either end and it will toggle

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.930 
plates on either end and it will toggle
the<00:03:15.959> lights<00:03:16.139> off<00:03:16.349> and<00:03:16.530> on<00:03:16.650> as<00:03:16.859> people<00:03:17.609> come<00:03:17.880> and

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
the lights off and on as people come and

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.509 
the lights off and on as people come and
go<00:03:18.090> out<00:03:18.299> of<00:03:18.389> the<00:03:18.450> hallway<00:03:19.010> but<00:03:20.010> anyway<00:03:20.370> that

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
go out of the hallway but anyway that

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.490 
go out of the hallway but anyway that
right<00:03:20.880> there<00:03:21.090> is<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.420> toggle<00:03:21.750> latch<00:03:21.900> let<00:03:22.410> me

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
right there is the toggle latch let me

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.760 
right there is the toggle latch let me
show<00:03:22.680> you

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
show you

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.610

another cool thing here i'm using my

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.350 
another cool thing here i'm using my
screwdriver<00:03:27.130> i<00:03:27.370> can<00:03:27.580> change<00:03:27.820> the<00:03:28.060> orientation

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
screwdriver i can change the orientation

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.690 
screwdriver i can change the orientation
of<00:03:28.990> it<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.440> screwdriver<00:03:29.920> is<00:03:30.100> actually<00:03:30.490> part

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
of it the screwdriver is actually part

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.030 
of it the screwdriver is actually part
of<00:03:30.820> the<00:03:30.880> red<00:03:31.090> power<00:03:31.300> to<00:03:31.510> mod<00:03:31.720> so<00:03:32.650> for<00:03:32.890> some

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
of the red power to mod so for some

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.360 
of the red power to mod so for some
reason<00:03:33.750> if<00:03:34.750> you<00:03:35.230> can't<00:03:35.470> get<00:03:35.710> you<00:03:35.860> can't<00:03:36.130> place

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
reason if you can't get you can't place

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.830 
reason if you can't get you can't place
it<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.700> direction<00:03:36.970> you<00:03:37.180> want<00:03:37.210> you<00:03:37.660> can<00:03:37.810> just

it the direction you want you can just

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.560 
it the direction you want you can just
place<00:03:38.470> it<00:03:38.500> haphazardly<00:03:38.860> and<00:03:39.610> then<00:03:40.270> you<00:03:40.390> can

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
place it haphazardly and then you can

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.390
