apparently my methods of getting to the

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.060 
apparently my methods of getting to the
moon<00:00:09.990> aren't<00:00:10.260> Canon<00:00:11.030> I<00:00:12.410> kind<00:00:13.410> of<00:00:13.469> jerry-rigged

moon aren't Canon I kind of jerry-rigged

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.730 
moon aren't Canon I kind of jerry-rigged
my<00:00:14.250> own<00:00:14.370> method<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.790> getting<00:00:14.940> there<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.480> so<00:00:16.440> as

my own method of getting there and so as
was<00:00:17.010> mentioned<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.670> me<00:00:17.820> in<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.390> counts<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.869> my

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
was mentioned to me in the counts of my

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.880 
was mentioned to me in the counts of my
previous<00:00:19.199> video<00:00:20.090> there<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.240> an<00:00:21.539> actual<00:00:21.890> can

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
previous video there is an actual can

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.820 
previous video there is an actual can
way<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.250> getting<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.850> moon<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.830> requires

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
way of getting to the moon that requires

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.509 
way of getting to the moon that requires
less<00:00:26.269> plus<00:00:27.269> speed<00:00:27.720> or<00:00:28.170> less<00:00:28.500> use<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.189> speed

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
less plus speed or less use of the speed

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.780 
less plus speed or less use of the speed
loop<00:00:29.840> so<00:00:30.840> parent<00:00:31.320> let's<00:00:31.470> just<00:00:31.619> get<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:31.980> do<00:00:32.640> have

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
loop so parent let's just get I do have

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.190 
loop so parent let's just get I do have
all<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.969> unlockables<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.690> actually<00:00:33.989> went

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
all the unlockables and actually went

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.229 
all the unlockables and actually went
through<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.410> game<00:00:34.620> really<00:00:34.890> quickly<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.460> did

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
through the game really quickly and did

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.370 
through the game really quickly and did
all<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.360> missions<00:00:36.630> except<00:00:36.930> getting<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.230> moon

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
all the missions except getting the moon

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.959 
all the missions except getting the moon
so<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.559> could<00:00:37.649> see<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.010> last<00:00:38.460> version<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.850> you

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
so you could see the last version of you

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.190 
so you could see the last version of you
to<00:00:39.030> do<00:00:39.149> it's<00:00:39.300> getting<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.840> moon

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
to do it's getting to the moon

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.840 
to do it's getting to the moon
I'll<00:00:40.770> just<00:00:40.890> go<00:00:41.010> at<00:00:41.100> our<00:00:41.190> bounds<00:00:41.520> with<00:00:41.640> out<00:00:41.820> of

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
I'll just go at our bounds with out of

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.490 
I'll just go at our bounds with out of
bounds<00:00:42.300> really<00:00:42.480> quickly<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:43.079> selling<00:00:43.410> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
bounds really quickly to selling the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.850 
bounds really quickly to selling the
hawk<00:00:43.710> which<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> hawk<00:00:45.030> another<00:00:45.420> eagle<00:00:45.989> is

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
hawk which is a hawk another eagle is

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
Nest and so now as soon as you picks you

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.160 
Nest and so now as soon as you picks you
up<00:00:53.449> let's<00:00:54.449> wait<00:00:54.660> for<00:00:54.870> it

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
there you go you see the Giant versus

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.709 
there you go you see the Giant versus
just<00:00:57.930> pulsating<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.770> Catco<00:00:59.219> game

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
just pulsating on the Catco game

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:01.939 
just pulsating on the Catco game
apparently<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.899> can<00:01:01.050> challenge<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.649> hawk

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949

to<00:01:09.240> do<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:10.130> as<00:01:11.130> my<00:01:11.340> first<00:01:11.549> time<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:11.850> camera<00:01:12.360> so

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
to do this as my first time on camera so

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.690 
to do this as my first time on camera so
I<00:01:12.990> haven't<00:01:13.710> actually<00:01:13.890> tried<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.430> out<00:01:14.549> with

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
I haven't actually tried this out with

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.280 
I haven't actually tried this out with
Frank<00:01:14.909> he<00:01:15.420> seems<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.720> be<00:01:15.810> going<00:01:15.900> down<00:01:16.140> pretty

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
Frank he seems to be going down pretty

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.340 
Frank he seems to be going down pretty
pretty<00:01:17.100> quickly<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.930> shouldn't<00:01:19.259> be<00:01:19.320> a

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
pretty quickly so it shouldn't be a

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.530 
pretty quickly so it shouldn't be a
problem

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
problem

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.640

see<00:01:25.259> what<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.409> does<00:01:25.799> oh<00:01:26.040> okay<00:01:26.869> now<00:01:27.869> what<00:01:28.110> that

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
see what that does oh okay now what that

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.740 
see what that does oh okay now what that
does<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.560> lets<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.159> control<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.700> hawk<00:01:29.880> very

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
does is lets you control the hawk very

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.929 
does is lets you control the hawk very
clever<00:01:31.170> very<00:01:31.380> cool<00:01:31.799> can<00:01:32.280> use<00:01:32.430> speed<00:01:32.729> boost

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
clever very cool can use speed boost

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.240 
clever very cool can use speed boost
while<00:01:33.090> you're<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.420> hawk<00:01:33.540> now<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.869> can't

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
while you're in the hawk now you can't

while you're in the hawk now you can't
all<00:01:35.250> right<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> actual<00:01:36.390> method

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
all right so this is the actual method

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.030 
all right so this is the actual method
of<00:01:36.960> getting<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.430> moon<00:01:39.590> once<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.740> beat<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
of getting to the moon once you beat the

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.190 
of getting to the moon once you beat the
hawk<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.490> cat<00:01:41.729> kill<00:01:41.970> minigame<00:01:42.540> always

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
hawk and the cat kill minigame always

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.960 
hawk and the cat kill minigame always
control<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.560> while<00:01:43.860> he's<00:01:44.040> carrying<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.850> off

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970

you<00:01:45.180> can<00:01:45.329> now<00:01:45.450> control<00:01:45.750> him<00:01:46.049> or<00:01:46.549> her<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.759> don't

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
you can now control him or her I don't

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.700 
you can now control him or her I don't
really<00:01:48.329> know<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.570> gender<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.899> this<00:01:49.079> hawk<00:01:49.259> and

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
really know the gender of this hawk and

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.330 
really know the gender of this hawk and
now<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.340> hawk<00:01:50.579> can<00:01:50.909> fly<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.210> into<00:01:52.250> into<00:01:53.250> the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
now the hawk can fly you into into the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.260 
now the hawk can fly you into into the
bridge<00:01:53.549> through<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.880> hole<00:01:54.030> at<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.149> bottom

bridge through the hole at the bottom

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.859 
bridge through the hole at the bottom
which<00:01:54.630> means<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.990> can<00:01:55.140> now<00:01:55.290> access<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:56.280> rail

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
which means you can now access the rail

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.920 
which means you can now access the rail
to<00:01:57.869> get<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.170> moon<00:01:58.340> very<00:01:59.340> clever<00:01:59.930> and

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
to get to the moon very clever and

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.380 
to get to the moon very clever and
something<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.100> added<00:02:02.460> as<00:02:02.759> an<00:02:02.969> annotation

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
something that I added as an annotation

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.420 
something that I added as an annotation
in<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.110> last<00:02:04.290> video<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.979> still<00:02:05.189> haven't
