00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:15.200
 4 While the customers are in Bremen's smart stadium 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.820
 the two opponents today to the desired approximately 11 5 11 11 affectionately 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.440
 first called eleven 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.650
 and statements from this 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:32.079
 March 2011 05 01 clock FIFA 11 percent so I compare in these the floods 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:37.360
 a game at least before 4 sees the first rank and coach committed 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.070
 the depth on ps3 looks better enough is our fault we have unfortunately 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.359
 an outdated capture card 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:46.990
 for the spice 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.420
 otherwise very small trifle even takes the opportunity 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.430
 Introducing the referees that does not make it 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.090
 And on the other hand, it is not the fault of FIFA 11 that the 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.370
 Commentators Purchase Premium Sweden we have purposely done »again 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.590
 can compare to the two variants 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.140
 use this right 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.310
 The two surround channels on the left and right will be the same 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.320
 most interesting shown 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.230
 play talk 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.860
 but now come to the match in Munich against Barcelona RPO both betrayed a lot 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.780
 Guest team has kicked off by default 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.860
 it's the other way around 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.750
 playing the two is not at all a rarity that it already in the first 5 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.470
 Minutes met in Turkey 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.470
 MacBook with you while looking through that is something to be discussed 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.960
 Of course I wish Tampere to play I think I have to say so 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.000
 until 18 Mainz's lead in the game is on them 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 the repetition 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.830
 this little Leni Rempler 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.130
 and easy game 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.310
 that's hopeful at FIFA hopeful goalkeeper 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.200
 an odd even though just uses the third one 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.590
 but there receives 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.590
 the game just keeps going 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.660
 b 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:19.519
 Jan also here, the PS percent referee has seen a clear foul 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.469
 Meier before her penultimate group game 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:26.469
 Kommersant push forward 

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:53.759
 often can 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.009
 because of rebuilding 

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:02.279
 what you are 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:04.179
 already can see here 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:07.069
 that may be better for warding off 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.929
 but let's play with us 

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:12.209
 the felting strip Fantastic Basta 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:17.109
 dramatically different we have already 19 food 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.389
 Maier never experienced 

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:34.669
 per Wildlife deeper but as often in the series the gates very often after 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:35.599
 flanks 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.119
 arise 

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:39.759
 that invests 

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:42.759
 on 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.569
 the work 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.229
 40 civilians 

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:52.499
 space 

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:55.499
 and flanked inside 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:57.519
 dpa 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.519
 and when he left from Wednesday 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:04.829
 that makes it deeper 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.540
 from the 15th of July that also makes theirs to remember 

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:13.159
 the cheer is deadly 47 percent 

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:16.709
 in short, they meet 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.979
 for opponents ball snatch us off to the other side 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:26.150
 the team from seventh peacefully possible it is well noticed with us 

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:27.249
 at FIFA 

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:28.939
 the funds granted 

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:32.080
 from the wall stands so there is a tendency 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.080
 difficult photo Heinz 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.110
 often played played Fri Wurselen second goal 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.080
 APA 4 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.620
 first eleven of July the rivers are July looks 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:57.379
 but now we come to pc-version under Favre with the domestic is straight 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:00.910
 First she is advised to let her off 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.880
 up to the war GBP 3 quiz rounds very nice contrast is the 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.070
 Selection of teams over this dynamic 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.070
 become a beautiful Lanz cash register 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:14.280
 but as I said so 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.720
 we have the resources in the world games is also useful where 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.620
 Trusted clock is also a necessity 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.919
 but also on the PC Xbox especially for the me so a little bit offensive 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.820
 Wiecher, on the other hand, pulls Mendes down considerably by the name 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.059
 boring out in the menus more lifeless 

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:37.909
 but offers more information so Grazern both teams it always fails 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:40.979
 Simon at a glance so summarized the 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:42.389
 above average 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.389
 strengthening attack midfielder and defensive 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:49.569
 So that's better solved but Cormier Dreamcatcher 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:51.599
 as already can be 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:54.229
 I personally liked Tbilisi 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.619
 significantly better 

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:58.520
 but it is only the effort 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.990
 Combo times 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.259
 in Schiphol at the TuS Holstein Foulkes 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:05.240
 now is until 11 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.599
 2 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:11.639
 come 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:14.639
 that did not hurt 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.319
 DAPD 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:23.749
 Neighbors Schweinis sees yellow so also in the pc version are the Pest Schiris 

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:26.749
 not just become richer from this position 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:37.030
 FIFA, however, mind pc version and console versions the table Trittin the 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.779
 Schiris Providers finally also a visit 

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:42.629
 there was guided tours for them 

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:46.569
 the Biggest is clear she's the scene in scene like Bypass Troy 

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:51.240
 but where Schweini will soon try Pascal Peitz sees the yellow card 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.089
 to 7 

00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:54.949
 Ute Müller here only 

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:56.569
 with a free kick 

00:06:56.569 --> 00:06:59.080
 penalized against Bayern Munich 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.590
 the Azego finally a small summary 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.770
 It's so damn difficult this year 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.830
 to choose a winner here 

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.970
 it's still been nations trucks 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.470
 The ball jumps as realistic as never 

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.790
 and the final climb seems to be a bit better than at 

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.870
 Slate that is also much thinner so you should become again 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:21.210
 is 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:24.410
 in terms of things she is doing both games for us 

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:29.070
 not at both there are now quite estimated percentage play and shot 

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:32.070
 Error you can there are all lock 

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:36.289
 Well, the license is once again slightly lower 

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:40.259
 but overall this should be decided this year from the stomach
