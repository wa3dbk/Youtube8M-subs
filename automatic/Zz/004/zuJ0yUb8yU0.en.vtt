ipod or iphone as far as touch controls
go<00:06:00.599> very<00:06:01.229> simple<00:06:01.680> but<00:06:01.800> works<00:06:02.069> and<00:06:02.400> i<00:06:02.729> like<00:06:02.939> that

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
go very simple but works and i like that

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
radical and trying it that way it's kind

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.279 
radical and trying it that way it's kind
of<00:06:11.370> a<00:06:11.490> pain<00:06:11.520> so<00:06:11.909> we'll<00:06:12.060> exit<00:06:12.419> so<00:06:12.870> that's<00:06:13.050> pretty

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:13.289 
of a pain so we'll exit so that's pretty

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:16.100
