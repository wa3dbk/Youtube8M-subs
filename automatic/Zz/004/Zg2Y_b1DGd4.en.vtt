you know the I needs a wrench take it
out<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:25.310> normally<00:00:26.310> if<00:00:26.880> your<00:00:27.180> weed<00:00:27.599> eater

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
out and normally if your weed eater

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.290 
out and normally if your weed eater
starts<00:00:28.260> up<00:00:28.500> like<00:00:29.130> especially<00:00:29.880> with<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.029> steel

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
starts up like especially with a steel

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.490 
starts up like especially with a steel
it<00:00:31.170> starts<00:00:31.710> up<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:33.149> idles<00:00:33.570> fine<00:00:33.899> but<00:00:34.380> when

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
it starts up and it idles fine but when

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.110 
it starts up and it idles fine but when
you<00:00:34.620> go<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.829> pull<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.160> gas<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.730> just<00:00:35.880> bogs

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
you go to pull the gas and it just bogs

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.770 
you go to pull the gas and it just bogs
down<00:00:36.480> most<00:00:37.380> likely<00:00:37.770> because<00:00:38.329> that<00:00:39.329> needs<00:00:39.660> to

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
down most likely because that needs to

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.490 
down most likely because that needs to
come<00:00:39.989> off<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.410> be<00:00:40.559> cleaned<00:00:42.110> did<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.290> last

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
why I would start up and then it would

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.430 
why I would start up and then it would
run<00:01:23.550> fine<00:01:23.850> nothing<00:01:24.659> was<00:01:24.810> really<00:01:24.960> wrong<00:01:25.260> with

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
it but when he would go to let it idle

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.010 
it but when he would go to let it idle
it<00:01:27.270> just<00:01:27.479> conk<00:01:27.750> out<00:01:27.960> well<00:01:28.770> that's<00:01:28.950> because<00:01:29.160> he

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
it just conk out well that's because he

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.660
