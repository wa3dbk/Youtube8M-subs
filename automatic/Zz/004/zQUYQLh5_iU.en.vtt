now<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.770> theory<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.250> actually<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.850> little<00:01:27.000> bit

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
now this theory is actually a little bit

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.760 
now this theory is actually a little bit
different<00:01:27.689> than<00:01:27.840> ones<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.200> I've<00:01:28.290> covered<00:01:28.590> in

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
different than ones that I've covered in

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.530 
different than ones that I've covered in
the<00:01:28.860> past<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.670> isn't<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.030> theory<00:01:30.299> about<00:01:30.390> a

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
the past this isn't a theory about a

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.510 
the past this isn't a theory about a
specific<00:01:30.810> movie<00:01:31.500> or<00:01:31.710> television<00:01:31.920> show

specific movie or television show
instead<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.509> about<00:01:33.659> something<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.140> we

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
instead this is about something that we

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.170 
instead this is about something that we
see<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.560> quite<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> few<00:01:35.009> movies<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.880> TV<00:01:36.150> shows

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.440 
see in quite a few movies and TV shows
nowadays<00:01:37.070> hacking<00:01:38.070> one<00:01:38.520> thing<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.119> and

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
nowadays hacking one thing that I and

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.210 
nowadays hacking one thing that I and
anybody<00:01:39.659> who<00:01:40.020> knows<00:01:40.229> anything<00:01:40.409> about<00:01:40.829> hacking

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
anybody who knows anything about hacking

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.280 
anybody who knows anything about hacking
is<00:01:41.549> noticed<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.090> movies<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.720> how<00:01:42.869> over

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
is noticed in movies is how over

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.410 
is noticed in movies is how over
glorified<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:44.100> souped<00:01:44.520> up<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.970> hacking

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
glorified and souped up the hacking

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.780 
glorified and souped up the hacking
process<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.079> shown<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.470> be<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.770> cinema<00:01:47.280> now<00:01:47.610> I'm

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
process is shown to be in cinema now I'm

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.399 
process is shown to be in cinema now I'm
not<00:01:47.970> going<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.119> go<00:01:48.329> into<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.689> details<00:01:49.140> about

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
not going to go into the details about

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.170 
not going to go into the details about
how<00:01:49.590> hacking<00:01:50.070> really<00:01:50.369> works<00:01:50.640> mainly<00:01:50.939> because

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
how hacking really works mainly because

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.749 
how hacking really works mainly because
it's<00:01:51.450> really<00:01:51.750> complicated<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.680> also<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.250> don't

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
it's really complicated and also I don't

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.639 
it's really complicated and also I don't
understand<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.600> but<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.930> can<00:01:55.020> tell<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.409> guys

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
understand it but I can tell you guys

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.020 
understand it but I can tell you guys
that<00:01:55.710> these<00:01:56.100> two<00:01:56.250> idiots<00:01:56.430> typing

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
that these two idiots typing

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.880 
that these two idiots typing
simultaneously<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.079> keyboard<00:01:58.290> would

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
simultaneously and a keyboard would

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.859 
simultaneously and a keyboard would
contribute<00:01:59.189> nothing<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.880> process<00:02:00.450> the

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
contribute nothing to the process the

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.300 
contribute nothing to the process the
thing<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.140> maybe<00:02:01.500> there's<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.890> reason<00:02:02.070> that

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
thing is maybe there's a reason that

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.280 
thing is maybe there's a reason that
hacking<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.000> movie<00:02:03.360> sounds<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:03.960> crazy

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
hacking in the movie sounds so crazy

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.990 
hacking in the movie sounds so crazy
when<00:02:04.619> hackers<00:02:04.860> are<00:02:05.159> describing<00:02:05.549> what<00:02:05.850> they're

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
when hackers are describing what they're

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.670 
when hackers are describing what they're
doing<00:02:06.360> according<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.049> this<00:02:07.229> theory<00:02:07.530> that

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
doing according to this theory that

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.350 
doing according to this theory that
reason<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.340> they're<00:02:08.789> completely

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
reason is they're completely

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.240 
reason is they're completely
bullshitting<00:02:09.989> now<00:02:10.440> by<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.830> i<00:02:10.860> mean<00:02:11.129> the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
bullshitting now by that i mean the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.900 
bullshitting now by that i mean the
hacker<00:02:11.489> is<00:02:11.700> just<00:02:11.940> filling<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.330> other<00:02:12.540> care

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
hacker is just filling the other care

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.030 
hacker is just filling the other care
ears<00:02:13.480> with<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:13.720> bunch<00:02:13.900> of<00:02:14.020> technical<00:02:14.590> jargon

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
ears with a bunch of technical jargon

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.200 
ears with a bunch of technical jargon
because<00:02:15.280> they<00:02:15.430> know<00:02:15.580> that<00:02:15.610> regardless

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
because they know that regardless

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.760 
because they know that regardless
they're<00:02:16.660> not<00:02:16.840> going<00:02:16.960> to<00:02:17.050> understand<00:02:17.470> anything

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
they're not going to understand anything

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.200 
they're not going to understand anything
they're<00:02:17.980> saying<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:18.670> they're<00:02:18.850> just<00:02:18.970> trying

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
they're saying and they're just trying

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.940 
they're saying and they're just trying
to<00:02:19.300> get<00:02:19.420> on<00:02:19.540> with<00:02:19.690> their<00:02:19.840> work<00:02:19.870> so<00:02:20.470> basically

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
to get on with their work so basically

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.440 
to get on with their work so basically
they're<00:02:21.100> just<00:02:21.310> answering<00:02:21.670> any<00:02:21.940> questions

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
they're just answering any questions

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.850 
they're just answering any questions
that<00:02:22.600> other<00:02:22.780> characters<00:02:23.260> have<00:02:23.470> so<00:02:23.710> they'll

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
that other characters have so they'll

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.500 
that other characters have so they'll
shut<00:02:24.130> up<00:02:24.280> and<00:02:24.550> so<00:02:24.670> they<00:02:24.790> can<00:02:24.850> focus<00:02:25.150> on<00:02:25.450> their

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
shut up and so they can focus on their

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.480 
shut up and so they can focus on their
work<00:02:25.660> now<00:02:26.410> believe<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:26.920> or<00:02:27.070> not<00:02:27.220> that's

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
work now believe it or not that's

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.220 
work now believe it or not that's
actually<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:28.090> entire<00:02:28.390> theory<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.110> I<00:02:29.170> do

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
actually the entire theory and I do

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.110 
actually the entire theory and I do
admit<00:02:29.620> that<00:02:29.680> it<00:02:29.890> doesn't<00:02:30.160> work<00:02:30.340> in<00:02:30.520> every<00:02:30.880> case

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
admit that it doesn't work in every case

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.910 
admit that it doesn't work in every case
now<00:02:31.690> that<00:02:31.870> being<00:02:32.050> said<00:02:32.170> I<00:02:32.350> really<00:02:32.650> think<00:02:32.770> it

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
now that being said I really think it

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.110 
now that being said I really think it
does<00:02:33.130> add<00:02:33.340> something<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.910> viewing

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
does add something to the viewing

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.150 
does add something to the viewing
experience<00:02:34.330> for<00:02:35.170> movies<00:02:35.530> that<00:02:35.740> involve

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
experience for movies that involve

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.950 
experience for movies that involve
hacking<00:02:36.790> now<00:02:37.120> if<00:02:37.240> you<00:02:37.330> don't<00:02:37.480> believe<00:02:37.720> this

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
hacking now if you don't believe this

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.750 
hacking now if you don't believe this
theory<00:02:38.230> we<00:02:38.410> can<00:02:38.530> expand<00:02:38.950> on<00:02:39.100> it<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:39.310> little<00:02:39.490> bit

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
theory we can expand on it a little bit

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.280 
theory we can expand on it a little bit
you're<00:02:39.970> kind<00:02:40.180> of<00:02:40.240> getting<00:02:40.360> two<00:02:40.690> theories<00:02:41.020> and

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
you're kind of getting two theories and

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.960 
you're kind of getting two theories and
one<00:02:41.500> here<00:02:41.980> there's<00:02:42.250> another<00:02:42.490> theory<00:02:42.760> that

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
one here there's another theory that

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.060 
one here there's another theory that
states<00:02:43.210> the<00:02:43.390> hacking<00:02:43.900> process<00:02:44.350> the<00:02:44.590> audience

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
states the hacking process the audience

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.890 
states the hacking process the audience
sees<00:02:45.370> is<00:02:45.670> just<00:02:45.970> how<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.120> protagonist

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
sees is just how the protagonist

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.960 
sees is just how the protagonist
understands<00:02:47.470> what's<00:02:47.650> going<00:02:47.710> on<00:02:48.130> so<00:02:48.640> even<00:02:48.880> if

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
understands what's going on so even if

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.370 
understands what's going on so even if
the<00:02:49.060> computer<00:02:49.450> screen<00:02:49.570> is<00:02:49.810> just<00:02:50.050> filled<00:02:50.290> with

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
the computer screen is just filled with

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.260 
the computer screen is just filled with
a<00:02:50.500> bunch<00:02:50.710> of<00:02:50.830> zeros<00:02:51.160> and<00:02:51.340> ones<00:02:51.550> if<00:02:51.970> the

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
a bunch of zeros and ones if the

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.790 
a bunch of zeros and ones if the
protagonist<00:02:52.990> thinks<00:02:53.260> something<00:02:53.560> more

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
protagonist thinks something more

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.130 
protagonist thinks something more
complicated<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.610> crazy<00:02:54.880> is<00:02:55.060> going<00:02:55.240> on<00:02:55.510> that's

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
complicated and crazy is going on that's

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.720 
complicated and crazy is going on that's
the<00:02:56.320> way<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.560> audience<00:02:57.010> is<00:02:57.160> going<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.370> see<00:02:57.580> it

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
the way the audience is going to see it

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.280 
the way the audience is going to see it
that<00:02:58.090> version<00:02:58.330> of<00:02:58.570> the<00:02:58.660> theory<00:02:58.960> kind<00:02:59.200> of

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
that version of the theory kind of

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.230 
that version of the theory kind of
bleeds<00:02:59.530> into<00:02:59.830> the<00:02:59.920> unreliable<00:03:00.700> narrator

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
bleeds into the unreliable narrator

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.330 
bleeds into the unreliable narrator
