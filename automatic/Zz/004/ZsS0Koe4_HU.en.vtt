00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:09.110
 hello today I want to tell you how we can 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.599
 make this ornament to hang it on the 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.179
 Christmas tree the materials that 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:18.440
 let's employ it would be decorative ribbon 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:21.200
 aluminum wire pliers and lacquer 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.090
 nails of different colors first 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.160
 what we're going to do is fold the thread 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.280
 aluminum that we just cut so that 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.400
 the two sides have the same distance 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:36.200
 of thread and in the middle we are going to make a 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:39.230
 small circle so let's rotate with 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.420
 one of them so that we stay at the 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.989
 same distance let's do the same 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:48.560
 operation with the other so let's do 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.810
 pressure for it to be fine and then what 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.390
 we will place the circle well and once 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:57.579
 that we have it this way what we are going to do 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:01.289
 is let's leave a distance 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.289
 and let's make a small circle 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:10.260
 so on the other side we're going to spin and 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.260
 let's do the same operation 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.700
 so now this thread here from above 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.550
 let's go through the other side of this 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.750
 way and we're going to rotate around the 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:27.630
 circle that we have done in this way and 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.100
 this thread here we have here we go 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.450
 to do the same operation we are going to 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:37.579
 pass it below and we're going to turn 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.579
 so that it stays like this 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.880
 now what we are going to leave is another 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.119
 small distance 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.439
 for example like this and we are going to make a 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.560
 circle a little bit bigger so already 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.869
 this distance approximately we can 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.229
 put the threads together so we can make a 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.240
 little to the idea at this distance we're going to 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:05.159
 do the same operation we are going to do 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.590
 We are going to leave you in a circle 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.039
 Now what we are going to do is the same as 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.680
 before what happens that this time according to what 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:19.400
 let's see here in the middle we're going to 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.400
 make a little ball like that down 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.650
 let's go through the bottom 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:31.460
 of the circle and let's leave it in this 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.440
 side so now this thread here that 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:37.100
 we had on this side let's do the 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.280
 same operation but the ball is going 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:43.100
 to do for example closer here so 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.290
 so that it stays like this let's move on 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.110
 below and we're going to rotate so that it 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.920
 let us stay like that 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:55.370
 now we do the same operation we leave 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:59.240
 a margin and let's make a small 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:02.150
 I turn here a little bit bigger we're going to 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.740
 leave more or less the same margin and 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.550
 let's do 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:12.560
 the turn to make our little ball 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:16.490
 so now what we do is this thread of 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.850
 here we are going to make another little ball but this 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.910
 once we are going to make it up a 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:27.400
 little bit more chiquitita for example 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:32.180
 at this height and go under and go 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:34.760
 to turn and now this one here we are going to 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.240
 do the same operation as before 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.210
 we were going to make a little ball to this 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.620
 distance approximately and we're going to 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.620
 go down to 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.390
 so that it stays like that 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.300
 our Christmas tree now what 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.000
 we are going to do is already close the tree 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.250
 Christmas because we do not have any more thread 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.180
 it is at this size it suits us very well 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:05.330
 to hang it and what we do is go 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.090
 spinning around the thread here 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:11.000
 medium and we can do 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.230
 still another little ball here a little bit more 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.150
 little 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.209
 depending on the thread that we have 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.150
 we are going to make a small ball 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:24.030
 and we are going to close it we are going to take the 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:28.590
 final aluminum thread and we're going to 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:32.040
 close it so that it stays closed 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.370
 and then it does not cost us at the time of 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.370
 paint 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:41.410
 so and the same operation we are going to do 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.030
 with this thread once we have it 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.510
 A) Yes 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:50.310
 well positioned as we like what 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:52.590
 let's do next is paint it 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.080
 let's decide what colors we are going to 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.240
 catch for our Christmas tree 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.789
 once we have already decided what 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.490
 colors to use to paint our 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:06.930
 Christmas tree, let's start 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:11.979
 to paint I have picked an orange 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:15.669
 pink and a yellow would only be put 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.990
 on top of the little ball that we made 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.530
 Brush 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:24.099
 to form a small layer of hairspray 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.789
 nails in this way well then let's go 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:26.789
 painting 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.280
 the different balls 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:37.350
 once we have already given the first 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:39.930
 nail varnish layer will expect 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.740
 dry and then we will give you a 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.740
 second hand 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:53.650
 once it is dry what we are going to 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:56.080
 to do is to take a decorative ribbon 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:06:00.220
 let's fold it like this so you can 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:04.259
 introduce yourself well so it is the 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.259
 little circle that we have left here up 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.220
 and let's make a small loop 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:22.580
 once we have finished doing 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:24.020
 the tie would remain so prepared 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.660
 to hang it in our tree 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.639
 Christmas, I hope you liked this one 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.360
 tutorial and see you in the next 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:31.360
 Thank you
