00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:14.749
 in a city like tiberias there is a lot of evidence of the 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:19.670
 architecture of the floors of all kinds of objects moments a lot of 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:20.279
 things 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.699
 years ago I had a conversion with a Christian friend and one of the things that 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.449
 I tell myself is that if one wanted to go to Jerusalem 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:33.030
 it was something easy to do one day none could go to various nativity scenes 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.770
 sites in which the events occurred that this encounter in the new 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.769
 will 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.830
 in the world it divides and everything as it is reflected in the scriptures is spoken of 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:54.850
 plants 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.850
 and of trees that we all know 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.670
 fixed 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.390
 almonds palmeiras wheat and silva when the new testament comes out you see the 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.370
 relationship between Jesus and his world 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.160
 and it will speak accurately about the animals that are raised in the middle 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.870
 ancient orient 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.690
 the animals that appear in the bible still exist today although it is true that 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.210
 some no longer exist in the area 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.740
 as is the case with the lions 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.130
 but the exploiters of a few centuries ago talked about them 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.060
 there is no doubt that although it does not exist or not and if it existed in antiquity 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.860
 Clear 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.460
 they announced that both writings of all the inmates surrounding the kingdom 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.270
 From Israel 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.780
 although not as abundant as the biblical manuscripts that were 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.140
 written by the Israelites themselves 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.220
 while financial institutions and has been preserved by the street that 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.269
 I looked 10 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.389
 a the chapter growth ive was made mobile internet 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:22.129
 verses 24 and 26 discovered because he had contracted in an excavation that 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.499
 he was speaking to whom jerusalem 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:29.980
 were found two small plant rolls that are written in Hebrew 

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:31.149
 old 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:35.529
 and they have the oldest biblical verses that are known and that are from 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:39.039
 permission or period the 7th cycle before Christ 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:48.919
 who want to climb the mountain they buy and this is test number 1 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.540
 where the scrolls of the Dead Sea were discovered 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.099
 in 1947 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:59.610
 all nor the books of the old testament except maybe the book the 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:04.930
 jester is among the parchments of the Dead Sea although said councilman 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.950
 the books of the old testament patient the parchments of the Dead Sea 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.950
 between 200 and the giant since the Christ 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:15.379
 so that the 5,500 manuscripts would remain the same 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:17.889
 the brilliance 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:22.829
 he was stopped in that he was part of it so there are many 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.209
 evidences of the gospels in Greek and the epistles of the new testament 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.549
 that go back to a very old time 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.629
 only a few decades after they were written for the first time there are 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.549
 that move the crypts hands that almost two thousand years ago the new testament 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.869
 and it makes you more than 2000 years old 

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:45.849
 there was 

00:03:53.869 --> 00:04:00.949
 a had a child for example in Germany was mentioned in their currencies 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.139
 Romans that were used in the time of Jesus 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:05.419
 in the first century of our era 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:09.790
 the pavement on which we are standing at this moment was 

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:13.079
 Coated by a stage from between ee 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:19.269
 without conditions centimeters of land of the mayoralty many coins that 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.360
 go back to the century whose few coins have more or less been found in that place 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.389
 during the excavation 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:33.110
 as the experience 2 four hundred 1st 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:39.159
 one 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:43.059
 the dignity of third parties but those battles and wars throughout the entire 

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:45.479
 history of Israelis 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.829
 there is talk of two points in the area and things like that 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.400
 for example when for this country the honors titles actually came down 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.409
 the purchases of the prices fell on the roofs of the houses 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:04.520
 that were later destroyed, that is why the layer of 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.129
 tips of the arrows and then the letter of the floors over the 2005 period 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:11.779
 there is the experience 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:13.680
 of the time of year 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.539
 we must be attentive at age 40 the agent the local 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:21.039
 where the shipyards will be 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:24.129
 the historian 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:27.129
 flavio josefo tells us about us nothing 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:31.639
 great rock to the country the sale the desert 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:33.180
 past yamada 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.180
 where he relates that there were about 900 

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:38.059
 Jews 

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:41.719
 who were followed by the Romans and who testified for it 

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:43.400
 in the decade of 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.820
 sixty was located on the site that escaped and sealed the judges or those of 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.870
 the deceased saw each other's faces I acquired the coins 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.870
 so that there is a very clear difference of 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:59.159
 very tragic event that happened today back 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:02.039
 thanks to archeology 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:05.749
 there is no civilization that can be destroyed in such a way 

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:09.529
 that there is no remnant dv of it 

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:12.939
 when the israel is a site that he explained begins to end 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:24.759
 we are here on the wall soon 70 to the temple mount or the wall of the 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:29.680
 laments as they sometimes call it the nose itself has an antiquity of two thousand 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.360
 20 years 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.639
 this wall was built by feijoo to be great 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:37.879
 and it was destroyed 

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:41.680
 gorostiza in the year 70 years of age that was common 

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:44.580
 when the Romans lit the 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.259
 2% 

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:50.129
 this was one of the great tragedies of jerusalem 

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:54.279
 I think that this symbolizes for this reason 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.529
 to stay here 

00:06:56.529 --> 00:06:59.899
 these pieces that illustrate the words of the gospel 

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:02.899
 When Jesus 

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:08.339
 of the temple then there will be no 

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:09.919
 on top of the other 

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:13.569
 follow these ruins I know that the illustration 

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:18.109
 clearer that you can cast yourself net of the words of Jesus
