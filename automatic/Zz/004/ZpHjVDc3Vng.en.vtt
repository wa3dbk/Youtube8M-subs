00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
little problem that is that we're kind

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.090 
little problem that is that we're kind
of<00:00:44.520> lacking<00:00:44.910> good<00:00:45.780> buttons<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.440> play<00:00:46.860> around

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
of lacking good buttons to play around

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.709 
of lacking good buttons to play around
and<00:00:48.469> if<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.649> play<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:50.160> lot<00:00:50.489> on<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.820> device<00:00:51.059> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
and if you play a lot on that device the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.279 
and if you play a lot on that device the
best<00:00:51.989> feed<00:00:52.170> grains<00:00:52.500> very<00:00:52.980> very<00:00:53.399> fast<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.629> in

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
best feed grains very very fast so in

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.700 
best feed grains very very fast so in
the<00:00:55.379> past<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.399> think<00:00:57.239> we<00:00:57.510> tried<00:00:57.719> me<00:00:58.410> like<00:00:58.559> this

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
the past I I think we tried me like this

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.610 
the past I I think we tried me like this
where<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.340> have<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.550> your<00:01:00.390> your<00:01:00.690> device<00:01:01.260> and

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
where you have a your your device and

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.429 
where you have a your your device and
you<00:01:01.680> have<00:01:01.800> your<00:01:02.390> controller<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:04.080> attach

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
you have your controller and you attach

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.670 
you have your controller and you attach
it<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.739> USB<00:01:05.070> cable<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.140> now<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.200> can<00:01:07.470> play

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
it to a USB cable and now you can play

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.260 
it to a USB cable and now you can play
and<00:01:08.060> it<00:01:09.110> helps<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.260> good<00:01:10.799> 2<00:01:10.979> gameplay<00:01:11.220> but<00:01:11.460> it's

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
and it helps a good 2 gameplay but it's

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.850 
and it helps a good 2 gameplay but it's
not<00:01:12.450> really<00:01:12.630> like<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.110> portable<00:01:13.619> gaming

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
device that it should be so my project

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.609 
device that it should be so my project
it<00:01:20.310> was<00:01:20.430> having<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:22.340> nokia<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:24.470> having<00:01:25.470> some

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
it was having this nokia and having some

that<00:01:47.130> we<00:01:48.030> put<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.270> microcontroller<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:49.200> there

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
that we put a microcontroller in there

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.280 
that we put a microcontroller in there
as<00:01:49.590> Cyprus<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.810> connect<00:01:53.390> this<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.630> Nokia

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
as Cyprus and connect this to the Nokia

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.620 
as Cyprus and connect this to the Nokia

what happens if you start doing that so

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.100 
what happens if you start doing that so
I<00:01:58.049> can<00:01:58.649> put<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.009> their<00:01:59.219> property<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.180> strip

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
I can put it in their property to strip

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.819 
I can put it in their property to strip
it<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.530> here's<00:02:02.460> your<00:02:02.640> real<00:02:02.790> ultimate<00:02:03.829> gaming

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
it and here's your real ultimate gaming

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.380 
it and here's your real ultimate gaming
device<00:02:05.189> which<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.399> can<00:02:05.640> hold<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.060> your<00:02:06.090> hand

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
and really play play fast games

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.289 
and really play play fast games
and<00:02:11.189> probably<00:02:12.189> even<00:02:12.370> impress<00:02:13.030> your<00:02:13.150> friends

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
and probably even impress your friends

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.270 
and probably even impress your friends
because<00:02:13.540> you<00:02:13.780> might<00:02:14.409> be<00:02:14.530> able<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.829> drop<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.250> so

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
because you might be able to drop it so

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.300 
because you might be able to drop it so
without<00:02:15.730> breaking<00:02:16.329> your<00:02:16.769> your<00:02:17.769> device<00:02:18.010> also

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
without breaking your your device also

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.190 
without breaking your your device also
think<00:02:18.640> that<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:19.269> connection<00:02:19.719> could<00:02:19.870> be<00:02:20.019> some

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
think that the connection could be some

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.110 
think that the connection could be some
some<00:02:20.409> extra<00:02:20.680> batteries<00:02:20.799> around<00:02:21.189> it<00:02:21.519> to<00:02:21.700> to

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
some extra batteries around it to to
