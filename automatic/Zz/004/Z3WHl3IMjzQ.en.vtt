cloney gallon went around the room

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.040 
cloney gallon went around the room
saying<00:00:52.850> if<00:00:53.850> you're<00:00:54.210> going<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.420> be<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.809> first

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
saying if you're going to be the first

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.930 
saying if you're going to be the first
to<00:00:55.140> enter<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.350> pot<00:00:55.590> bring<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.399> for<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.730> raise

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
to enter a pot bring it in for a raise

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.930 
to enter a pot bring it in for a raise
and<00:00:57.300> then<00:00:57.420> Mike<00:00:57.690> matacão<00:00:58.320> said<00:00:58.680> no<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.100> don't<00:00:59.789> do

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
and then Mike matacão said no I don't do

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.549 
and then Mike matacão said no I don't do
that<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.840> course<00:01:00.899> everyone<00:01:01.260> has<00:01:01.289> their<00:01:01.530> own

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
that so of course everyone has their own

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.039 
that so of course everyone has their own
way<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.739> playing<00:01:02.039> what<00:01:02.730> do<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.940> say<00:01:03.180> well<00:01:03.780> I

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
way of playing what do you say well I

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.630 
way of playing what do you say well I
think<00:01:04.290> it's<00:01:04.530> probably<00:01:04.739> best<00:01:05.129> if<00:01:05.280> your<00:01:05.430> first

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
think it's probably best if your first

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.000 
think it's probably best if your first
two<00:01:05.790> about<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.180> bring<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.540> for<00:01:06.720> raise<00:01:06.869> but<00:01:07.470> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
two about to bring in for raise but the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.760 
two about to bring in for raise but the
deeper<00:01:08.220> stack<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.880> structure<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.990> more<00:01:10.260> okay

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
deeper stack the structure the more okay

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.190 
deeper stack the structure the more okay
is<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.310> come<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.640> for<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.850> limb<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.689> Mike's<00:01:12.960> used

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
is to come in for a limb so Mike's used

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.690 
is to come in for a limb so Mike's used
to<00:01:13.290> playing<00:01:13.470> very<00:01:13.740> very<00:01:13.979> deep<00:01:14.189> stacked<00:01:14.460> event

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
to playing very very deep stacked event

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.490 
to playing very very deep stacked event
right<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:15.150> lot<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.420> our<00:01:15.630> bootcamp<00:01:15.840> students

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
right a lot of our bootcamp students

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.620 
right a lot of our bootcamp students
used<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.799> playing<00:01:17.009> smaller<00:01:17.700> events<00:01:17.970> where

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
used to playing smaller events where

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.870 
used to playing smaller events where
they<00:01:18.720> have<00:01:18.840> very<00:01:19.110> bad<00:01:19.380> structures<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
they have very bad structures so the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.850 
they have very bad structures so the
faster<00:01:21.299> structure<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:21.960> less<00:01:22.200> chips<00:01:22.680> you

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
faster structure and the less chips you

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.070 
faster structure and the less chips you
have<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.189> work<00:01:23.369> with<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:24.180> more<00:01:24.360> properties<00:01:24.990> to

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
have to work with the more properties to

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.480 
have to work with the more properties to
just<00:01:25.259> come<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.439> for<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.680> raise<00:01:25.860> because<00:01:26.250> your

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
just come in for a raise because your

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.340 
just come in for a raise because your
implied<00:01:26.820> odds<00:01:27.060> or<00:01:27.299> less<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:27.869> Mike's<00:01:28.110> used<00:01:28.290> to

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
implied odds or less so Mike's used to

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.499 
implied odds or less so Mike's used to
playing<00:01:28.560> with<00:01:28.650> 20,000<00:01:29.490> chips<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.240> blinds

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
playing with 20,000 chips and the blinds

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.929 
playing with 20,000 chips and the blinds
are<00:01:30.689> 50<00:01:31.229> 100<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:32.189> know<00:01:32.280> if<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.430> could<00:01:32.520> limp<00:01:32.759> in

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
are 50 100 you know if you could limp in

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.789 
are 50 100 you know if you could limp in
and<00:01:33.210> pop<00:01:33.360> up<00:01:33.479> they<00:01:33.600> can<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:33.990> stack<00:01:34.320> somebody

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
and pop up they can and stack somebody

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.999 
and pop up they can and stack somebody
becomes<00:01:35.670> very<00:01:35.909> worth<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.390> verse<00:01:37.110> when<00:01:37.860> you're
