a lot of bottom and you know almost kind
of<00:02:16.320> works<00:02:16.500> like<00:02:16.620> an<00:02:16.770> octave<00:02:17.190> type<00:02:17.600> type

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
of works like an octave type type

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.140 
of works like an octave type type
facility<00:02:19.140> but<00:02:20.130> it<00:02:20.250> just<00:02:20.340> fountains<00:02:20.820> out<00:02:21.000> the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
facility but it just fountains out the

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.670 
facility but it just fountains out the
bottom<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.570> especially<00:02:21.990> you'll<00:02:22.290> notice<00:02:22.560> it

just<00:02:25.140> dig<00:02:25.410> this<00:02:25.620> I<00:02:25.830> mean<00:02:25.980> Ashdown<00:02:26.340> started

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
just dig this I mean Ashdown started

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.060 
just dig this I mean Ashdown started
doing<00:02:26.970> this<00:02:27.090> in<00:02:27.350> 97<00:02:28.350> when<00:02:28.440> they<00:02:28.590> launched<00:02:28.830> the

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
doing this in 97 when they launched the

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.760 
doing this in 97 when they launched the
line<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.810> it's<00:02:30.810> really<00:02:31.290> been<00:02:31.470> one<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.650> the

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
line and it's really been one of the

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.220 
line and it's really been one of the
best<00:02:31.980> features<00:02:32.190> on<00:02:32.490> these<00:02:32.670> amps<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.210> see<00:02:33.780> an<00:02:33.840> XLR

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
best features on these amps I see an XLR

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.230 
best features on these amps I see an XLR
here<00:02:34.440> so<00:02:34.590> is<00:02:34.710> that<00:02:34.800> like<00:02:34.860> a<00:02:35.190> DI<00:02:35.490> on<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.940> front

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
here so is that like a DI on the front

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.510 
here so is that like a DI on the front
is<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.840> after<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.350> tone<00:02:37.530> stack<00:02:37.800> yep<00:02:38.130> you<00:02:38.340> got

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
is that after the tone stack yep you got

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.060 
is that after the tone stack yep you got
it<00:02:38.550> you<00:02:39.000> got<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.240> so<00:02:39.900> there's<00:02:40.350> just<00:02:40.410> two<00:02:40.710> models

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
it you got it so there's just two models

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.800 
it you got it so there's just two models
and<00:02:41.220> there's<00:02:41.400> just<00:02:41.640> combos<00:02:42.030> available<00:02:42.630> and

and there's just combos available and

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.870 
and there's just combos available and
then<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.410> jump<00:02:43.620> up<00:02:43.800> into<00:02:44.040> your<00:02:44.160> max<00:02:44.400> series

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
then you jump up into your max series

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.220 
then you jump up into your max series
now<00:02:45.060> let's<00:02:45.180> still<00:02:45.360> consider<00:02:45.750> this<00:02:45.900> kind<00:02:46.110> of

and gain and you've also got to master
volumes<00:06:26.520> here<00:06:26.760> which<00:06:26.910> is<00:06:27.060> kind<00:06:27.270> of<00:06:27.330> cool<00:06:27.510> so

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 
volumes here which is kind of cool so

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.250 
volumes here which is kind of cool so
you<00:06:27.780> can<00:06:27.900> have<00:06:28.020> two<00:06:28.169> volumes

you can have two volumes

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.380 
you can have two volumes
a channel<00:06:29.740> which<00:06:30.190> is<00:06:30.310> also<00:06:30.520> put<00:06:30.850> switchable

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:31.390 
a channel which is also put switchable

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:32.910 
a channel which is also put switchable
in<00:06:31.510> the<00:06:31.600> four-way<00:06:31.900> puts<00:06:32.140> which<00:06:32.350> does<00:06:32.650> come

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:32.920 
in the four-way puts which does come

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.090 
in the four-way puts which does come
with<00:06:33.460> the<00:06:33.640> amplifier<00:06:34.950> channel<00:06:35.950> a<00:06:36.070> is

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.100 
with the amplifier channel a is

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.760 
with the amplifier channel a is
basically<00:06:36.610> a<00:06:36.700> clean<00:06:37.060> channel<00:06:37.540> channel<00:06:38.260> B<00:06:38.470> is

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:38.770 
basically a clean channel channel B is

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.560 
basically a clean channel channel B is
really<00:06:39.190> your<00:06:39.340> overdrive<00:06:39.850> channel<00:06:40.300> and<00:06:40.480> you've

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:40.570 
really your overdrive channel and you've

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.210 
really your overdrive channel and you've
also<00:06:40.750> got<00:06:40.960> an<00:06:41.050> additional<00:06:41.440> boost<00:06:41.650> on<00:06:41.950> there

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.220 
also got an additional boost on there

also got an additional boost on there
which<00:06:42.910> again<00:06:43.090> is<00:06:43.480> switchable<00:06:43.870> on<00:06:44.230> the

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
which again is switchable on the

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.250 
which again is switchable on the
four-way<00:06:44.920> foot<00:06:45.190> switch<00:06:45.460> effects<00:06:46.420> wise<00:06:46.690> you

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:47.260 
four-way foot switch effects wise you
