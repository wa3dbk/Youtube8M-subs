00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
off of it and so got these kind of root

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.809 
off of it and so got these kind of root
down<00:02:48.989> right<00:02:49.260> now<00:02:49.410> so<00:02:50.280> what<00:02:50.370> we're<00:02:50.549> going<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.700> do

I'm gonna soak it in the five-gallon

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.640 
I'm gonna soak it in the five-gallon
bucket<00:02:53.519> of<00:02:53.610> water<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.209> try<00:02:55.019> to<00:02:55.079> get<00:02:55.200> all<00:02:55.440> the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
bucket of water and try to get all the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.009 
bucket of water and try to get all the
soil<00:02:55.829> we<00:02:56.069> can<00:02:56.250> can<00:02:56.910> off<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.269> this<00:02:57.359> all<00:02:57.900> right

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
soil we can can off of this all right

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.220 
soil we can can off of this all right
well<00:02:58.230> I<00:02:58.260> got<00:02:58.470> most<00:02:58.680> of<00:02:58.799> dirt<00:02:58.980> off<00:02:59.160> it<00:02:59.190> nah<00:02:59.700> I

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
well I got most of dirt off it nah I

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.900 
well I got most of dirt off it nah I
didn't<00:03:01.230> get<00:03:01.349> all<00:03:01.560> out<00:03:01.799> but<00:03:02.459> I<00:03:02.489> didn't<00:03:02.790> want

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
didn't get all out but I didn't want

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.780 
didn't get all out but I didn't want
damage<00:03:03.299> the<00:03:03.450> roots<00:03:03.660> so<00:03:03.900> um<00:03:04.109> I<00:03:04.640> think<00:03:05.640> that's

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
damage the roots so um I think that's

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.539 
damage the roots so um I think that's
good<00:03:06.030> enough<00:03:06.150> I<00:03:06.540> just<00:03:07.140> don't<00:03:07.290> want<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.650> really

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
good enough I just don't want to really

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.890 
good enough I just don't want to really

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
worried about a damaging the roots

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.650 
worried about a damaging the roots
anyways<00:03:12.900> there<00:03:13.620> she<00:03:13.920> is

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660

longer bass here and it's longer depth

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:51.960 
longer bass here and it's longer depth
here<00:05:51.100> for<00:05:51.550> the<00:05:51.640> roots

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
here for the roots

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.460 
here for the roots
I'm<00:05:52.390> hoping<00:05:52.690> this<00:05:52.810> give<00:05:53.110> it<00:05:53.140> a<00:05:53.230> little<00:05:53.350> bit

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
more structure and only put the water

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.810 
more structure and only put the water
depth<00:05:56.140> to<00:05:56.950> about<00:05:57.190> right

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
depth to about right

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.690 
depth to about right
see<00:05:58.000> our<00:05:58.030> thumbs<00:05:58.390> out<00:05:58.600> right<00:05:59.080> about<00:05:59.200> there<00:05:59.700> so

the rest of this will be all dry
basically<00:06:02.590> that<00:06:02.950> roots<00:06:03.160> will<00:06:03.310> be<00:06:03.340> wicking<00:06:03.790> up

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940
