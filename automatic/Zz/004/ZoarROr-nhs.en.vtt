00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
see it in the back of my videos and a

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.220 
see it in the back of my videos and a
lot<00:00:39.970> of<00:00:40.059> people<00:00:40.300> would<00:00:40.390> ask<00:00:40.540> me<00:00:40.719> to<00:00:40.809> do<00:00:40.960> one<00:00:41.110> but

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
lot of people would ask me to do one but

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.540 
lot of people would ask me to do one but
I<00:00:41.290> never<00:00:41.500> did<00:00:41.770> because<00:00:41.950> I<00:00:42.160> feel<00:00:42.280> like<00:00:42.399> I<00:00:42.489> don't

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
I never did because I feel like I don't

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.240 
I never did because I feel like I don't
really<00:00:42.760> have<00:00:42.969> that<00:00:43.420> many<00:00:43.719> perfumes<00:00:44.250> but

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
really have that many perfumes but

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.220 
really have that many perfumes but
either<00:00:45.640> way<00:00:45.910> I<00:00:45.940> mean<00:00:46.210> it<00:00:46.899> doesn't<00:00:47.050> really

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
either way I mean it doesn't really

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.810 
either way I mean it doesn't really
matter<00:00:47.500> right<00:00:47.590> so<00:00:48.040> I<00:00:48.070> figured<00:00:48.460> I'd<00:00:48.579> go<00:00:48.730> ahead

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
matter right so I figured I'd go ahead

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.490 
matter right so I figured I'd go ahead
and<00:00:48.969> do<00:00:49.239> it<00:00:49.360> since<00:00:49.750> they're<00:00:49.989> all<00:00:50.110> kind<00:00:50.379> of

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
and do it since they're all kind of

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.049 
and do it since they're all kind of
cutesy<00:00:50.739> and<00:00:51.040> bottles<00:00:51.399> and<00:00:51.520> stuff<00:00:51.730> and<00:00:51.940> maybe

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
cutesy and bottles and stuff and maybe

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.889 
cutesy and bottles and stuff and maybe
you<00:00:52.239> can<00:00:52.420> get<00:00:52.570> an<00:00:53.230> idea<00:00:53.440> of<00:00:53.980> cute<00:00:54.969> perfumes<00:00:55.420> and

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
you can get an idea of cute perfumes and

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:57.869 
you can get an idea of cute perfumes and
stuff<00:00:56.590> like<00:00:56.739> that<00:00:56.950> I'm<00:00:57.070> not<00:00:57.160> gonna<00:00:57.340> talk<00:00:57.640> too

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
stuff like that I'm not gonna talk too

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.000 
stuff like that I'm not gonna talk too
much<00:00:58.000> about<00:00:58.239> what<00:00:58.420> they<00:00:58.539> smell<00:00:58.870> like<00:00:59.010> because

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
much about what they smell like because

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.170 
much about what they smell like because
I'm<00:01:00.280> not<00:01:00.489> good<00:01:00.699> at<00:01:00.820> that

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
I'm not good at that
