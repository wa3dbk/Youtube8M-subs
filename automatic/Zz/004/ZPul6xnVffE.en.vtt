like the fact that i provided a pencil
for<00:01:24.750> them<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.619> it's<00:01:26.369> worth<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.790> i<00:01:26.820> mean<00:01:26.970> even<00:01:27.090> if

pencils it helps cut down the amount of
time<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.280> you're<00:01:32.670> fussing<00:01:33.360> at<00:01:33.450> your

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
experience so when someone doesn't have

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.100 
experience so when someone doesn't have
a<00:01:38.729> pencil<00:01:38.909> occurs<00:01:39.150> again<00:01:39.360> go<00:01:39.869> ahead<00:01:39.990> and
