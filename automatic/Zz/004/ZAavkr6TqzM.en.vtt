00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.090 
the coating will not come off the color
will<00:00:42.989> stay<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:44.000> so<00:00:45.000> that's<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.629> big<00:00:45.840> advantage

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
for a lot of the anglers as well I think

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.410 
for a lot of the anglers as well I think
it's<00:00:49.890> going<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.100> be<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> big<00:00:50.520> big<00:00:50.760> seller<00:00:51.030> for<00:00:51.149> as

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
it's going to be a big big seller for as

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.810 
it's going to be a big big seller for as
I<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:52.199> texture<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.770> really<00:00:53.039> really<00:00:53.610> perfect

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
I the texture is really really perfect

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.740 
I the texture is really really perfect
as<00:00:54.300> well

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
as well

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.010 
as well
