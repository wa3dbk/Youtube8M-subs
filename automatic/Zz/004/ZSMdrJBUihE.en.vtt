00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.759 

in<00:00:07.170> this<00:00:07.500> it's<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:08.450> Lego<00:00:09.450> -<00:00:09.900> they're<00:00:10.290> about<00:00:10.559> I

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
in this it's a Lego - they're about I

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.860 
in this it's a Lego - they're about I
built<00:00:11.099> without<00:00:11.550> instructions<00:00:14.480> how<00:00:15.480> it<00:00:15.660> works

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
built without instructions how it works

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.710 
built without instructions how it works
this<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.980> see<00:00:17.190> those<00:00:17.400> batteries<00:00:18.029> in<00:00:18.210> here<00:00:18.510> and

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
this you see those batteries in here and

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.590 
this you see those batteries in here and
then<00:00:18.900> this<00:00:19.680> turns<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.430> on<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.609> off<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.510> it

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
then this turns it on and off and it

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.130 
then this turns it on and off and it
goes<00:00:21.810> big<00:00:22.170> here<00:00:23.000> which<00:00:24.000> sends<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.930> then

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
goes big here which sends this and then

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.009 
goes big here which sends this and then
there's<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.769> really<00:00:26.220> small<00:00:26.330> right<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.720> there

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
there's a really small right is there

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.569 
there's a really small right is there
and<00:00:28.670> then<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:30.260> goes<00:00:31.260> really<00:00:31.619> fast<00:00:31.800> but<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.430> don't

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
and then it goes really fast but I don't

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.729 
and then it goes really fast but I don't
wanna<00:00:32.700> coach<00:00:32.940> did<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.360> one<00:00:33.630> it's<00:00:33.809> bigger<00:00:34.320> so

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
wanna coach did this one it's bigger so

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.389 
wanna coach did this one it's bigger so
it<00:00:35.280> turns<00:00:35.489> lower<00:00:36.230> and<00:00:37.230> when<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:37.860> one<00:00:38.160> turns

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
it turns lower and when this one turns

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.340 
it turns lower and when this one turns
around<00:00:38.550> once<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.390> one<00:00:39.629> has<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.960> turn<00:00:40.170> around

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
around once this one has to turn around

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.750 
around once this one has to turn around
one<00:00:41.090> because<00:00:42.090> it's<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.600> same<00:00:42.870> axle<00:00:43.760> and

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
one because it's on the same axle and

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.350 
one because it's on the same axle and
then<00:00:45.200> this<00:00:46.200> one<00:00:46.770> has<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.399> turn<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:47.910> one<00:00:48.149> and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
then this one has to turn this one and

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.080 
then this one has to turn this one and
this<00:00:48.510> one<00:00:48.800> smaller<00:00:49.800> than<00:00:50.160> this<00:00:50.340> one<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:50.670> this

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
this one smaller than this one so this

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.540 
this one smaller than this one so this
one<00:00:51.300> takes<00:00:51.480> longer<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.199> turn<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.739> then

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
one takes longer to turn and then

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.819 
one takes longer to turn and then
there's<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.850> small<00:00:54.210> gear<00:00:54.510> right<00:00:54.899> there<00:00:55.170> since

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
there's a small gear right there since

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.740 
there's a small gear right there since
they're<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.550> same<00:00:56.730> axle<00:00:57.649> it<00:00:58.649> has<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.460> UM<00:00:59.969> go

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
they're on the same axle it has to UM go

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.429 
they're on the same axle it has to UM go
the<00:01:00.930> same<00:01:01.140> around<00:01:02.070> once<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.609> then<00:01:03.140> this<00:01:04.140> one

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
the same around once and then this one

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.060 
the same around once and then this one
attaches<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.610> one<00:01:06.290> which<00:01:07.290> goes<00:01:07.680> even

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
attaches to this one which goes even

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.910 
attaches to this one which goes even
slower<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.299> doesn't<00:01:09.720> go<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.869> slap<00:01:10.260> then

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
slower so it doesn't go to slap then

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.620 
slower so it doesn't go to slap then
this<00:01:11.130> ones<00:01:11.430> are<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> gear<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.119> here<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.570> a

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
this ones are the gear in here and a

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.490 
this ones are the gear in here and a
gear<00:01:12.930> right<00:01:13.140> there

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
gear right there

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.350 
gear right there
and<00:01:13.860> these<00:01:14.700> are<00:01:15.240> reduction<00:01:16.170> gear<00:01:16.759> and<00:01:17.759> because

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
and these are reduction gear and because

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.109 
and these are reduction gear and because
they<00:01:18.930> reduce<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.830> speed<00:01:20.570> then<00:01:22.700> so<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.759> put

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
they reduce the speed then so I put

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.290 
they reduce the speed then so I put
something<00:01:25.020> up<00:01:25.409> in<00:01:25.830> here<00:01:26.240> and<00:01:27.240> then<00:01:27.930> I

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
something up in here and then I

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.050 
something up in here and then I
that<00:01:29.510> Packard<00:01:30.310> you<00:01:31.310> know<00:01:31.520> it's<00:01:31.820> nothing

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
that Packard you know it's nothing

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.920 
that Packard you know it's nothing
really

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
really

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.470 
really
and<00:01:33.590> then<00:01:33.800> if<00:01:34.010> I<00:01:34.190> turn<00:01:34.520> it<00:01:34.730> around<00:01:34.880> then<00:01:35.360> it

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 
and then if I turn it around then it

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.050 
and then if I turn it around then it
goes<00:01:35.660> the<00:01:35.840> other<00:01:35.900> way<00:01:36.170> then<00:01:37.010> if<00:01:37.190> I<00:01:37.340> tilt<00:01:37.730> this

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
goes the other way then if I tilt this

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.830 
goes the other way then if I tilt this
bucket<00:01:38.660> and<00:01:39.620> then<00:01:40.220> I'll<00:01:40.400> be<00:01:40.490> spilled<00:01:41.420> on<00:01:41.600> you

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
bucket and then I'll be spilled on you

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.460 
bucket and then I'll be spilled on you
then<00:01:42.800> it's<00:01:42.980> all<00:01:43.190> in<00:01:43.220> the<00:01:43.550> day

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
then it's all in the day

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:54.570 
then it's all in the day
you're<00:01:44.770> absolutely<00:01:44.890> dead

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.640 

it's<00:01:55.570> fine<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:58.270> you're<00:01:58.750> on

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
it's fine this you're on

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.520 
it's fine this you're on
oops<00:02:00.400> backwards<00:02:01.180> and<00:02:01.480> a<00:02:01.540> seven-minute

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
oops backwards and a seven-minute

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.890 
oops backwards and a seven-minute
because<00:02:02.890> it's<00:02:03.070> true<00:02:03.400> but<00:02:04.150> if<00:02:04.240> it<00:02:04.390> goes<00:02:04.540> forth

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
because it's true but if it goes forth

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:12.140 
because it's true but if it goes forth
and<00:02:10.710> bear

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
and bear

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.390 
and bear
okay
