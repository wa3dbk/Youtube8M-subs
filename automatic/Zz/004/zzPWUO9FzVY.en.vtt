glitch<00:00:06.089> basically<00:00:06.870> this<00:00:07.049> is<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.230> round<00:00:07.440> skip

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
glitch basically this is a round skip

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.350 
glitch basically this is a round skip
because<00:00:07.859> you<00:00:08.069> don't<00:00:08.250> need<00:00:08.400> any<00:00:08.670> ammo<00:00:09.030> at<00:00:09.179> all

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
because you don't need any ammo at all

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.020 
because you don't need any ammo at all
you<00:00:09.540> can<00:00:09.690> just<00:00:09.840> sit<00:00:10.019> here<00:00:10.050> for<00:00:10.400> five<00:00:11.400> hours<00:00:11.429> and

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
you can just sit here for five hours and

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.459 
you can just sit here for five hours and
you'll<00:00:12.150> probably<00:00:12.300> be<00:00:12.540> around<00:00:12.900> 90

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
you'll probably be around 90

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.530

but anyways as you can see here this is

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.210 
but anyways as you can see here this is
another<00:00:15.900> perspective<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.710> glitch<00:00:16.890> from

make it shield a regular shield that

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.990 
make it shield a regular shield that
doesn't<00:00:58.379> need<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.559> be<00:00:58.649> invincible<00:00:59.000> basically

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
doesn't need to be invincible basically

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.220 
doesn't need to be invincible basically
what<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.239> want<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.420> do<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.780> put<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.109> as<00:01:01.199> close

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
is basically the zombie shield which

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.880 
is basically the zombie shield which
basically<00:01:05.900> creates<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.049> barrier<00:01:07.380> where<00:01:07.710> they

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
basically creates the barrier where they

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.120 
basically creates the barrier where they
run<00:01:08.100> against<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.760> wall<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:10.140> car<00:01:10.710> like

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
run against the wall and the car like

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.679 
run against the wall and the car like
that<00:01:11.340> alright<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:11.820> from<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.210> next<00:01:12.420> step<00:01:12.570> you

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
that alright and from the next step you

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.080 
that alright and from the next step you
want<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.840> make<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> invincible<00:01:13.560> trap

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
want to make the invincible trap

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.240 
want to make the invincible trap
basically<00:01:15.090> make<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.570> trap<00:01:15.869> hold<00:01:16.320> square<00:01:16.770> put

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
basically make the trap hold square put

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.800 
basically make the trap hold square put
it<00:01:17.340> down<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> left<00:01:18.119> side<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.600> table

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
it down to the left side of the table

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.620 
it down to the left side of the table
look<00:01:19.470> back<00:01:19.680> up<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.100> grab<00:01:20.460> another<00:01:20.970> trap<00:01:21.360> you

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
look back up and grab another trap you

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.390 
look back up and grab another trap you
should<00:01:21.840> have<00:01:21.990> two<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:23.070> one<00:01:23.250> you're

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
should have two and the one you're

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.740 
should have two and the one you're
holding<00:01:23.430> now<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.150> invincible

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
holding now is invincible

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.450 
holding now is invincible
just<00:01:25.020> like<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.290> turbine<00:01:25.650> next<00:01:26.189> thing<00:01:26.310> you're

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
just like the turbine next thing you're

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.859 
just like the turbine next thing you're
on<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.700> you're<00:01:26.880> gonna<00:01:26.939> want<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.330> do<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.659> put

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
on it you're gonna want to do is put

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.510 
on it you're gonna want to do is put
down<00:01:27.990> your<00:01:28.170> invincible<00:01:28.590> trap<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.070> just<00:01:29.280> put<00:01:29.430> it

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
down your invincible trap so just put it

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.429 
down your invincible trap so just put it
right<00:01:29.820> where<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.240> zombies<00:01:30.600> go<00:01:30.810> make<00:01:31.320> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
right where the zombies go make the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.990 
right where the zombies go make the
rounds<00:01:31.470> go<00:01:31.710> as<00:01:31.890> fast<00:01:32.070> as<00:01:32.310> possible<00:01:32.400> and

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
rounds go as fast as possible and

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.999 
rounds go as fast as possible and
basically<00:01:33.720> you're<00:01:33.990> set<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.560> next<00:01:34.799> thing<00:01:34.920> you

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
basically you're set the next thing you

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.530 
basically you're set the next thing you
might<00:01:35.040> want<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.430> do<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.820> make<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.119> glitch<00:01:36.360> go

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
might want to do to make this glitch go

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.789 
might want to do to make this glitch go
a<00:01:36.570> little<00:01:36.720> bit<00:01:36.869> faster<00:01:37.259> make<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.530> rounds<00:01:37.770> go

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
a little bit faster make the rounds go

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.640 
a little bit faster make the rounds go
faster<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.460> make<00:01:38.850> an<00:01:38.970> invincible<00:01:39.479> RPD<00:01:40.229> slash

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
faster is make an invincible RPD slash

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.830 
faster is make an invincible RPD slash
turret<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.369> doesn't<00:01:41.610> really<00:01:41.700> matter<00:01:42.000> if<00:01:42.689> you
