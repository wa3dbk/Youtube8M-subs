collection<00:00:28.910> so<00:00:29.910> why<00:00:30.090> did<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.359> usually<00:00:30.869> at<00:00:31.019> ECU

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
collection so why did I usually at ECU

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.850 
collection so why did I usually at ECU
see<00:00:31.769> for<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.430> base<00:00:32.610> body<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.780> then<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.320> chopped

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
see for the base body and then I chopped

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.010 
see for the base body and then I chopped
down<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.130> legs<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:36.149> extend<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.989> height<00:00:37.190> and

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
down the legs to extend the height and

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.069 
down the legs to extend the height and
the<00:00:40.020> Kate<00:00:40.290> it's<00:00:41.250> only<00:00:41.550> all<00:00:42.239> were<00:00:42.660> calling

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
the Kate it's only all were calling

spawn<00:00:43.350> figure<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.950> think<00:00:44.700> it's<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:45.230> Caminos

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
spawn figure I think it's a Caminos

spawn figure I think it's a Caminos
fault<00:00:47.750> and<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.989> make<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.410> Cape<00:00:50.100> removable<00:00:50.789> so

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
fault and I make this Cape removable so

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.549 
fault and I make this Cape removable so
you<00:00:51.120> can<00:00:51.860> articulate<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.190> him<00:00:54.110> so<00:00:55.110> here<00:00:55.440> you

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
you can articulate in him so here you

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:03.389 
you can articulate in him so here you
can<00:00:55.710> see<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.010> Cape

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399

something nice cooked out of spikes
protection<00:02:22.980> area<00:02:25.159> saying<00:02:26.159> go<00:02:26.400> through<00:02:26.730> it

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
protection area saying go through it

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.220 
protection area saying go through it
which<00:02:27.000> go<00:02:27.209> up<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:27.599> down<00:02:27.719> a<00:02:27.780> little<00:02:27.959> bit<00:02:28.230> I

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
which go up and down a little bit I

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.220 
which go up and down a little bit I
scoped<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:31.349> out<00:02:31.469> dying<00:02:31.920> muscles<00:02:32.689> but<00:02:33.689> still<00:02:34.109> he

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
scoped it out dying muscles but still he

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:49.570 
scoped it out dying muscles but still he
would<00:02:34.379> keep<00:02:34.909> the<00:02:35.909> cut<00:02:36.150> under<00:02:36.540> thigh

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.120 

for<00:02:50.210> the<00:02:50.330> articulation<00:02:50.660> his<00:02:51.290> head<00:02:51.350> labels<00:02:51.890> go

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
for the articulation his head labels go

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.790 
for the articulation his head labels go
side<00:02:52.670> to<00:02:52.700> side<00:02:53.110> and<00:02:54.110> that's<00:02:54.350> it

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
side to side and that's it

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.370 
side to side and that's it
so<00:02:55.370> we<00:02:55.490> can<00:02:55.730> go<00:02:55.880> forward<00:02:56.210> and<00:02:56.360> back<00:02:56.600> in<00:02:56.990> and<00:02:57.230> out

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
so we can go forward and back in and out

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.400 
so we can go forward and back in and out
retain<00:02:58.070> the<00:02:58.220> bicep<00:02:58.700> on<00:02:59.360> the<00:02:59.570> elbow<00:02:59.870> and

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
retain the bicep on the elbow and

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.890 
retain the bicep on the elbow and
rotating<00:03:00.830> the<00:03:00.950> wrist<00:03:01.420> same<00:03:02.420> thing<00:03:02.630> on<00:03:02.750> this

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
rotating the wrist same thing on this

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.290 
rotating the wrist same thing on this
side<00:03:04.390> there<00:03:05.390> is<00:03:05.510> also<00:03:05.930> a<00:03:06.110> twitchy<00:03:06.440> rotate<00:03:07.300> he

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
side there is also a twitchy rotate he

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.790 
side there is also a twitchy rotate he
still<00:03:08.630> has<00:03:08.840> two<00:03:09.080> ways<00:03:09.470> articulation<00:03:11.770> no<00:03:12.770> I

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
still has two ways articulation no I

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.850 
still has two ways articulation no I
approach<00:03:13.280> because<00:03:13.760> I<00:03:14.390> scoped<00:03:14.930> it<00:03:15.050> uh<00:03:15.170> this

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
approach because I scoped it uh this

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.550 
approach because I scoped it uh this
white<00:03:16.130> thing<00:03:16.210> the<00:03:17.210> legs<00:03:17.420> it<00:03:17.660> was<00:03:17.810> go<00:03:17.990> forward

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
white thing the legs it was go forward

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.150 
white thing the legs it was go forward
and<00:03:19.220> back<00:03:19.430> in<00:03:19.730> and<00:03:20.060> out<00:03:20.440> I'll<00:03:21.440> tell<00:03:21.650> you<00:03:21.740> apart

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
and back in and out I'll tell you apart

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.950 
and back in and out I'll tell you apart
legs<00:03:23.140> single<00:03:24.140> joint<00:03:24.410> means<00:03:24.680> and<00:03:25.510> he's<00:03:26.510> ankle

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
legs single joint means and he's ankle

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.340 
legs single joint means and he's ankle
so<00:03:27.110> they<00:03:27.200> would<00:03:27.320> go<00:03:27.530> up<00:03:27.740> and<00:03:27.890> down<00:03:28.870> so<00:03:29.870> I<00:03:29.900> guess

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
so they would go up and down so I guess

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.680 
so they would go up and down so I guess
