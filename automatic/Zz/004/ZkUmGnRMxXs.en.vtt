00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
start the day the California condor is a

start the day the California condor is a
very<00:01:24.520> rare<00:01:24.880> bird<00:01:25.180> it<00:01:25.390> was<00:01:25.509> on<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:26.080> verge<00:01:26.350> of

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
very rare bird it was on the verge of

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.830 
very rare bird it was on the verge of
extinction<00:01:26.890> in<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.220> 70s<00:01:27.700> and<00:01:28.479> they<00:01:28.659> had<00:01:28.780> a

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
extinction in the 70s and they had a

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.090 
extinction in the 70s and they had a
couple<00:01:28.990> of<00:01:29.110> breeding<00:01:29.409> programs<00:01:29.830> where<00:01:30.009> they

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
couple of breeding programs where they

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.670 
couple of breeding programs where they
reintroduced<00:01:30.790> the<00:01:30.939> Condor<00:01:31.360> into<00:01:32.259> this<00:01:32.380> part

thought<00:01:37.149> we<00:01:37.330> would<00:01:37.420> just<00:01:37.570> see<00:01:37.750> one<00:01:37.899> perched<00:01:38.710> on

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
thought we would just see one perched on

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.980 
thought we would just see one perched on
the<00:01:38.890> side<00:01:38.979> of<00:01:39.220> the<00:01:39.280> road<00:01:39.430> so<00:01:39.789> I<00:01:40.060> hope<00:01:40.780> you<00:01:40.899> guys

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.220 

still<00:01:45.970> no<00:01:46.150> cell<00:01:46.390> service<00:01:46.600> we're<00:01:46.870> gonna<00:01:46.990> go<00:01:47.110> get

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.230 
still no cell service we're gonna go get

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.770 
still no cell service we're gonna go get
some<00:01:47.380> bacterial<00:01:47.770> agent<00:01:48.270> cell<00:01:49.270> service<00:01:49.540> right

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
some bacterial agent cell service right

00:01:49.780 --> 00:02:03.530 
some bacterial agent cell service right
don't<00:01:50.140> I<00:01:50.560> do<00:01:50.650> not<00:01:51.390> exactly
