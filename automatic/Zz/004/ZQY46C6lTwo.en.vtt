00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.370
 hello everyone you are with the sun today 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.410
 arrived to the concert to a stranger not yet 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.690
 artist whose name is Artem Brewers 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.460
 we talked a little about him but I 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.619
 fundamentally did not learn about him 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.990
 in more detail and want to form 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.690
 your opinion about him and his work after 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.970
 today's event is better than new 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.770
 dating can only be dating with 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.230
 talented artist and be me 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.120
 knew almost nothing about artem I 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.550
 for some reason decided that it is clearly 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.190
 something special just wondering what 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.899
 my motto is probably thinking unique in that 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.230
 that i am as honest as possible to myself 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.540
 yourself though 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.160
 think it thinks everyone thinks 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.760
 artist who makes music which 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.550
 like the first thing this this of 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.160
 kns and all and so you know to say 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.950
 here's cool poison because i don't know 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.710
 they know how and I do not know how loud such myself 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.650
 talk i 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.619
 I do what I like the concert 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.299
 Artyom Brewer promised to be interesting 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.909
 many invited guests are intriguing 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.450
 program everyone's favorite hits and new 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.940
 songs 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.100
 however, every artist sees an event with 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.840
 a completely different side than the viewer 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.360
 but since I am today as a spectator 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.700
 I expect nothing really I became 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.200
 I wonder what awaits Artem himself 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.810
 today a lot 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.869
 better joys a lot of cool 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.430
 people of my friends musicians group 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.680
 nerves 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.210
 Nikita Presnyakov 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.360
 and us 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.490
 and we are playing big tonight with 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.300
 we have one more guitar player and we have a very 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.610
 will be very loud and we are waiting 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.020
 very, very lucky onlookers 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.750
 first of all because 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.670
 we are such an energy bumper 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.890
 sort of musical we should 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.049
 sign feed on energy you need 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.590
 if its not we will we will 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.880
 shut off 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.130
 we play we play if nothing 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.049
 happens we turn off in the middle 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.090
 events I began to realize that 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.670
 just obliged to download a couple of tracks 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.069
 artem guys managed to intrigue me 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.080
 which means I’m intriguing you 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.920
 veil of secrecy and creative plans for 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.410
 the future is up to the idea of ​​tea as a father 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.130
 which are engaged in 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.930
 I do not whether different guys 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.330

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.000
 We will find the tracks shared with 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.500

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.870

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.900

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.300

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.770
 new level and on better quality 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.840
 sea ​​level so of course i could stay 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.720
 at home and skip the stranger's concert 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.970
 outside the artist but I arrived at the bottom 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.010
 did not regret the creative way Artem 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.440
 only begins and here is our report 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.830
