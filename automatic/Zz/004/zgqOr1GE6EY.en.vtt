00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.130
 hello good morning everyone to teach 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.560
 prepare some kidneys eggs is a 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.080
 recipe very fast and very simple what 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.480
 first we have to have are eggs 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.670
 I have 12 eggs 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.119
 more or less for four people tuna 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.090
 three cans of fried tomato tuna and 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.369
 mayonnaise whoever wants can 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.800
 chopped peppers or olives if you like them 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.419
 I do not like I prefer it more 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.920
 simple and faster 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.920
 we take and put the eggs to boil 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:39.020
 we have already laid the eggs now 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.920
 we put a cap and take the atom 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.460
 we throw in a bowl 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.199
 this already according to how you see for example if 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.390
 You see that it is missing because you throw a little 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.430
 more and see that you are short with milk 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.269
 there is a little less this will have to 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.190
 mix with the yolks of the eggs by 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.949
 that you do not believe the first when you 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.729
 echÃ©is seems that there is little you catch 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.729
 legislature 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:09.670
 and you throw mayonnaise mayonnaise on 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.670
 fried tomato 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.910
 the tomato fried to the grave 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.990
 do not worry, it seems the first thing 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:25.420
 there is a lot but that pricking them a lot 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.039
 fried tomato to tuna but not because 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.289
 spoke the egg then when milk 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.450
 eggs eggs we leave dry and then 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:34.509
 jce mixture and the mixture is crushes 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.820
 everything and so only later when they have 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.230
 cooked we lose the eggs and we throw 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.080
 the yolk 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.520
 as a kind of rag also it 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.390
 can make meat that I'll upload 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.390
 another day this recipe 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.530
 once we have already known the eggs 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.900
 we have gone through cold water and the 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.240
 we have peeled on fronts and parties 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.220
 we split them in half 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.560
 we split all the eggs and go 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.640
 throwing the yolks inside the tuna with the 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.860
 tomato we removed all the yolks and 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.050
 we leave as two or three buds out as 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.050
 a lot of baseband or starting 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.540
 we throw the yolks that you just have to 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.989
 make him a little bit like that 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:23.239
 the yolk is left and left with all 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.239
 the eggs as you see 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.489
 Y 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.610
 now all the buds we have to 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:47.180
 mix in the blue with the tomato 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.180
 we have to crush go mixing all 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.250
 it has to stay as well as pastures and 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.750
 but not that it is too dry because 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.460
 they have to stay 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.120
 as wet because many 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:03.920
 yolks I would have to toss more tomato 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.990
 beige and this general stuffed dough 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.700
 as I said before here you can catch him 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.760
 and you can take peppers if you want or 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.270
 Olives that you like I do not like 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.270
 I have not done it 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.950
 and once all this is already moved 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.260
 with a teaspoon what we do is 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.540
 take 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:28.510
 and fill the egg that is put on 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.049
 and sets 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.370
 well with all the eggs that does not 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.640
 I'm going to record because if we do not take long 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.379
 you see the eggs and the 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.329
 we have filled in what I have done 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:42.489
 been turning around I have covered them 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:45.549
 with mayonnaise and the yolks we had 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.409
 I've scratched them over them 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.989
 I have put decoration that is what he 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:51.849

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.640

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.620
 ration and here's a good family 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.120
 this is a little bit more than one serving and 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.780
 this is a familiar 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:04.420
 You see the lettuce around 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:07.120
 olives peppers and is scratched on 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.010
 grated egg the yolk and always remember 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.170
 you take the egg you turn around 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.909
 once I saw it fill in and lg is a layer 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.930
 mayonnaise there is also prayer that with the 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:18.489
 same egg and spoon grabs him with 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.220
 mayonnaise and you do the same way 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.470
 egg and milk and the yolk around like 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.729
