00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.650
 in today we are going to know how to 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:14.190
 performs the process of scaling a 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.190
 male shirt 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:25.690
 the climber increases or reduces from 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:28.119
 of our base size the 38 our 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.980
 The first step is to perform the analysis of the 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.920
 size chart is the difference 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.210
 numerical between carve italy to have the 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.550
 result of these differences 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.810
 we will obtain the proper proportions of 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.450
 each measure of the detail chart 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.760
 in the second step already having the pattern 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.470
 of the shirt we proceed to climb it 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.270
 we start at the front where 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.210
 we found the center angle in front 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.700
 neck which is deadlock then 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.410
 we found the neck angle shoulder in 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.960
 where according to the proportions of 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:04.010
 detail table analysis we upload 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.770
 and we go down the axis and 3 millimeters and 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:10.220
 we run on the positive and negative x axis 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.950
 2 millimeters we continue with the angle 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.190
 Shoulder shoulder there we go up and down in the 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.060
 shaft and 3 millimeters and we run on the shaft 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.380
 positive and negative x 3 millimeters 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.780
 rectifying at the same time that the 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.050
 measure the length of the shoulder increase or 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.119
 decrease according to your size we go down 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.310
 the wide point of the chest where 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.759
 we run on the positive and negative x axis 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.340
 6 millimeters we keep going down to the point 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:41.149
 sisa side where we run on the axis 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.270
 x positive and negative 1.2 centimeters 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.490
 according to the new analysis in addition to the point 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.850
 waist side where on the shaft and 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.190
 goes up and down 3 millimeters and we run in 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.060
 the positive and negative x axis 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.060
 in every way 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.149
 We went to the side of the ring where 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:03.640
 we go up and down on the y axis 6 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.460
 millimeters and we run on the x axis 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.830
 positive and negative 1.2 centimeters 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.780
 now we are going to the location of 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.799
 clamp where the apex of the clamp 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.930
 runs on the positive and negative x axis 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:20.019
 0.25 millimeters at waist level 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.410
 each of its sides goes up on the y axis 3 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:26.920
 millimeters and runs on the positive x axis 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.410
 and negative 0.25 millimeters already in the 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.980
 Pince points and heights goes up and down in 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:37.390
 the axis and 6 millimeters and runs on the shaft 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.880
 positive and negative x 25 mm 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.459
 to finish the front we find 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.330
 the angle center front hem which 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.620
 rise and fall on the 6- millimeter axis 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.450
 we finish with the union of each of 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.950
 these points achieving the scaling of 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.770
 each size 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.739
 we continue with the back which has 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.959
 a design with the medium we are located in 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.860
 the center back neck point which 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:05.230
 rise and fall on the axis and three millimeters 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.170
 we go back to the shoulder neck point where 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.860
 rise and fall on the axis and three millimeters 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.140
 and runs on the positive and negative x axis 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.840
 five millimeters 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.120
 we went to the shoulder shoulder point where 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.640
 we go up and down on the y axis 3 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.030
 millimeters and we run on the x axis 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.140
 positive and negative 3 millimeters 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.209
 rectifying the measurement at the same time 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.700
 of shoulder length that increases or 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.740
 decrease according to your size then 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.560
 we go from the point sisa cut of the mile 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:38.050
 where we run on the positive x axis and 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.400
 negative 6 millimeters and we take it to 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.799
 die at the apex of the cut 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.110
 we paid to the point if the court of the mile 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.569
 in the back and there as in the 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.060
 ring we run on the positive x axis and 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.610
 negative 6 millimeters and we take them to 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.950
 die at the apex the cut then we go to 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.439
 back sisa wide back where 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.859
 we run on the positive and negative x axis 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:03.170
 6 millimeters we go down to the point armhole 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:07.480
 side where we run on the x axis 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:10.000
 positive and negative 1 point centimeters 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.640
 in the point waist lying down we go up and 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.879
 we go down on the shaft and 3 millimeters and 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.310
 we run on the positive and negative x axis 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:19.690
 1.2 centimeters on the side point 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.450
 Arena 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.720
 we go up and down 6 millimeters and 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.240
 we run on the positive and negative x axis 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.310
 1.2 centimeters we finished at the point 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.070
 center after ring where we went up and 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.990
 we go down on the shaft and 6 millimeters and 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.850
 we end by joining each one of these 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.940
 points of scale 2 and achieve the 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.220
 diferents sizes 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.590
 in the neck increases only in the 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.140
 ends with one centimeter on each side 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.450
 both at the foot of the neck and in the 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.270
 neck and his shoulder pickets run 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:54.510
 on the positive and negative x axis 0.25 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.280
 millimeters and we end up joining these 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.800
 points with the hundred behind the neck 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.110
 finally we climb the sleeve we start 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.570
 at the point of the sleeve on which 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.970
 we go up and down on the axis 3 millimeters 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.520
 then when we go to the midpoint between 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.770
 head demand and sisa where we run in 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.090
 the positive and negative x axis of 6 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.760
 millimeters 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.250
 in the manga union strip we run in the 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.949
 positive and negative x axis 1.2 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.199
 centimeters and to finish we go down to 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:25.510
 the fist sleeve joining points where 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:27.760
 we go down and go up on the y axis 3 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.669
 millimeters and we run on the x axis 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.229
 positive and negative 3 millimeters 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.800
 we finish joining these points scale 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:36.080
 two 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.020
 in the fist part we only run 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.190
 at the ends 03 millimeters and 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.650
 we rectify the line 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.320
 finally the scaled pockets 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.720
 layers and roads for beaches 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.750
 small do not increase and for tasks 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.820
 large ones increase 0 5 millimeters all over 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:57.860
 the outline taking into account that 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.860
 Our valley size is 38 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.840
 the neck increase total 2 centimeters 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:14.620
 that's why in the front we go up 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.840
 3 millimeters and we run 2 millimeters 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.750
 increasing by a total of 5 millimeters and 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:23.240
 in the back we went up 3 millimeters and 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:26.060
 we run 5 millimeters increasing a 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.490
 total of 5 millimeters since the 3 that 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:31.810
 we go up they are simply shifting not 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:33.910
 they are holding or reducing 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.190
 the waist contour increased in total 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.680
 6 millimeters which are distributed 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.990
 in the 3 millimeters that we went up in the 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.389
 neck and 3 millimeters that we went down in the 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:46.510
 waist keeping in this way the 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:49.530
 measurement of waist length 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:52.540
 the head length increases 6 mm 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:55.020
 lowering the parallels by center front 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.020
 and back
