 in this little camille very nice 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.870
 because I do not know if you'll see there 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:30.500
 there are crew payet balls there we can 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:33.170
 see them shine here micro glitter 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:38.210
 that gives you an effect 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:40.190
 glos the weekend I finish with the sum 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.600

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:50.960
 always head towards you complicated 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:53.290
 we will do it this time I go back on 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.290
 the eyes 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:02.790
 and we go down to the world afterwards to 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:06.020
 do well to return the product not your 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.020
 skin like these on museum 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.790
 it also allows to activate the 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.490
 microcirculation of the face what is 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.430
 no more then the moisturizing care side 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.500
 of the face is completed then what I 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.090
 often do I put a little touch 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:27.030
 or a corrector and lights etc there that 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.200
 I will apply here otherwise it will be I 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.690
 go like this because as I have a 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.910
 dry skin hands here if not if I put 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.420
 a little bit more then I come powder and 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.120
 to fix everything and here I am going to 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.820
 make up and tonight to show you 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.090
 my evening seperate routine at 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.090
 see you later 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.670
 and that's the day is over I'm going 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.130
 so go to the evening care so I 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.750
 start by removing my makeup 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.540
 like that I take the opportunity to show you 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.970
 a video of removing make-up when we 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.880
 how do we do how I do 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.010
 so is one or two small tips 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.940
 at eye level 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.910
 I do not know why I'm starting 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:16.220
 always by the front pop in rank the 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.220
 eyebrows to fight 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.150
 we have a go-ahead then for the 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:27.480
 eyes we just put cotton like that 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:31.100
 we hit attacks can we tap tap tap 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:36.390
 tap tap tap all and remove 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:38.490
 I have all removed are rubbed and 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.880
 below 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.780
 sail if you have too much mascara this 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.720
 that can happen when we do a 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:49.380
 evening well well colorful up what you 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:53.940
 do you put a cotton under it in 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:57.300
 does it like that wedges and lashes between 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.820
 both and that's how you know 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:07.260
 cdpa underneath and hi you well go on 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:12.290
 do our eye yes change of place 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:16.140
 to apply a detoxifying jelly 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.420
 cleansing and exfoliating organic 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:22.970
 term 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.970
 I take only in the hand I come 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.020
 and then vince 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:46.690
 obviously for this step we think of 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.700
 to avoid the eye contour 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:52.010
 finally to apply the jelly x free 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.170
 Of course not hear for that if that too 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.910
 but hey I have to admit that I do not 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.590
 not the jelly shot every time 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.140
 on the other hand after makeup removal 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.880
 even if he does not exfoliate this 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.330
 what to do next is apply 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.040
 a moisturizing tonic lotion so I 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.970
 that of yves rock 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.560
 but I also had that of biotherm 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.130
 with the jelly of just now in a 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.870
 pack 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.760
 so here are households using blow drying 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.860

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.940

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:31.490

 and finally I come to apply the 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.470
