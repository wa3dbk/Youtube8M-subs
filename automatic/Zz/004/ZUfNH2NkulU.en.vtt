can play this chord a number of ways but
the<00:02:13.870> easiest<00:02:14.020> version<00:02:14.590> uses<00:02:15.280> your<00:02:15.400> index

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.350 
it tends to make the sounds a little
muddy<00:02:30.980> so<00:02:31.980> roll<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.310> index<00:02:32.670> finger<00:02:32.970> down<00:02:33.150> to

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
and you can play a d / f sharp by using

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:49.980 
and you can play a d / f sharp by using
a<00:02:42.370> full<00:02:42.670> D<00:02:42.880> chord<00:02:43.180> too<00:02:48.420> but<00:02:49.420> it's<00:02:49.570> easier<00:02:49.870> to

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
a full D chord too but it's easier to
