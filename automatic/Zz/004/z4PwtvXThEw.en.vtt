00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.869
 eurobike is today a topic of combo and 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.430
 to me andreas product manager and 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.099
 of value we want today once such a 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.939
 a little bit the 2015 look at new things 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.009
 and light up 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.230
 the first of these stands before us 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.960
 Carbon pattern on the subject of remake in Brno 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.689
 our keyword as ten times short 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.460
 summary what has the gallo 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.200
 actually like a door on me 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.790
 for half a year on everyone's lips 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.559
 we are also in communication 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.969
 this project breaks new ground 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.289
 we have been publishing since january 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:42.879
 our homepage the individual 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:45.420
 development skeptical so everyone of the 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.949
 Interested in this project or 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.600
 other topic in general can be so 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:51.460
 How is a framework developed? 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.170
 what are the individual steps and how 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.319
 are in principle the state of ours 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.749
 project is basically part of the project 

00:00:56.319 --> 00:01:00.309
 to say that an enduro bike too 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:00.999
 develop volker bonenberg too 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.550
 develop 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:04.750
 in full equipment from twelve kilo the 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.770
 We managed to remember that now 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.360
 already on our pre-series carbon pattern 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.430
 So we have a monocoque main frame 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.829
 we have a full carbon underbody in the 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.630
 We upstate system have chose 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:18.520
 We are looking for a 4- link system 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.180
 classic with horst link decided 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.890
 the damper is through the seat tube 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.539
 led and fleet stored we have 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.130
 yes , he has his huge breakthrough 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:30.070
 Half a school bus fits in there 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.210
 yes, that is also important because we can use it 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.530
 frame also as a frame child offer 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.630
 We want buyers to the location 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.310
 put any spring elements what 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.140
 available in the market is to assemble 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.510
 that means we basically had to do that 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.520
 create a lot of space that we the the 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.470
 end consumers no no limits 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.479
 put in the assembly of the spring leg 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:52.100
 okay is driven in principle 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.619
 The framework is evolving to eleven at a time 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.610
 that's the topic in the mountain bike 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.409
 general area 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.450
 the clou on the frame is that we too 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.140
 The possibility of having twice 10 too 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.670
 mount 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.729
 we have a special tool plate 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.320
 developed in principle as as 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.660
 Umwerfer recording acts and thus the 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.489
 which also puts the customer in the position 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.830
 any equipment what chaining 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.200
 to mount at the trift the whole 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.940
 There's only one kabul on the one hand 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.970
 of course, in carbon to another, that will 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.220
 theme in aluminum go the 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.930
 it will also do the most of all the aluminum advice 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.390
 as a framework and as a complete market 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.870
 and there we rise in the price range 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.459
 1990 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.050
 With that we think I'm extreme on the market 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.640
 well positioned that is quite a 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.900
 Ferrari does not sound that way either 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.100
 as if that were only for a model now 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.269
 years shall be remembered 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.709
 no of course we do not have that 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.660
 frame of course for several years 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.160
 Of course this is supposed to be the trade 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.840
 enable not only as advice 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.390
 over a year but over several years 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.010
 price stable for sale 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.870
 this is also the topic of longer model cycles 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.910
 what what will happen away from Indo 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.519
 absolutely we as conti have ourselves 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.640
 decided the sportive mountain bike 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.470
 Program thus speaks the q series fully 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.320
 allmountain or 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.299
 htl then as all and pavon version too 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.620
 to go through two years means 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.299
 So here for the trade he has 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.560
 no old models in the second year he 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.120
 can also in the second year the 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.510
 resell products stable prices 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.070
 sees this in the mountain bike areas 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.600
 namely, from who the new topic there 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.760
 I wnat easy to 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.250
 next talk about it yes want to go 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.910
 we can gladly do so with it 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.950
 we already at the next 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.299
 category the e mountainbikes and 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.280
 Andreas I am here now above all 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.500
 Feel and take my head 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.370
 something I have long not seen what 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.570
 81 has a huge issue CHF 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.380
 we felt the strong demand 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.120
 and we have our homework 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.920
 we can do on the eurobike 1 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.829
 present complete new development 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.720
 we have a sweater with bosch here 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:45.650
 drive 27 half to the impeller size 130 mm 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.659
 suspension fork 130 million 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.400
 effect so very comfortable we have 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:51.769
 a lot of joint behind system with 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.569
 classic horse link and the clou is 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.010
 that all cables are laid inside too 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.360
 So a very small optics a very 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.629
 sporty look i think a lot 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:03.200
 beautiful turned off cue beautiful 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:07.010
 rat form completion july i have them 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.590
 then ring in the ear or the location 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.920
 injured europe has already been called 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.750
 study with articles and what afterwards 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.100
 longer quiet that's right we have 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.169
 shown at eurobike last year 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.780
 what we are going to do with the rider 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.699
 ie we have in front of them new running a 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.470
 new impeller size to give 27 in half 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:26.960
 inch he gets a continuously variable transmission 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.789
 we have developed this for a long time 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.620
 important for such a very complex system 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.300
 All tests are completed we can 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.919
 say the modernization phase is now 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.840
 We will take him over to the eurobike 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.430
 present we have had driver on 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.820
 eurobike open to the or during the 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:44.000
 eurobike and will end sometimes 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.250
 have ok then we are curious 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.800
 if we are already in the category e 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.139
 mountain bikes are or what do we speak 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.440
 what else do you have an update or 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.669
 new models have mountain bike sector 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.069
 I have a whole lot so we have that 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.090
 whole basic program 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:02.039
 revised so speak we have the 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.169
 he models more a new one 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.970
 given the framework we have new impeller 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.319
 sizes we have a complete 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.610
 new design introduced 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:10.139
 but maybe we can do that 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.440
 a wheel to see what we should 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:11.789
 do 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.759
 Let's go over to the next council 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.919
 that is exactly how we stand in principle 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:17.460
 all of the new models 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.569
 even if you can see it 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.550
 revised frames we have now 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:21.330
 So new hydro forms under pipe we 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.400
 have very nice athletic 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.770
 failing otherwise as with the 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.169
 other wheels also in misplaced trains like 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.180
 I said, we have new impeller sizes we 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:32.370
 now have 27 1 half time we have 29 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.909
 inch and it even gets a 28 inch cross 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.310
 wheel 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:38.969
 in the boarding area as seen here he 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:41.009
 327 19 99 this will be our prize-bouncer 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:43.110
 will be there next year too 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:44.639
 with active drive everything about this 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.469
 model is we are basically with 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.940
 equipping performance drive okay and 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:50.219
 I think it's still relative 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.530
 beautiful as the new design the new 

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:55.669
 layout for 15 would look like 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:58.050
 right that the keyword design 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:00.210
 our standard program mountainbike 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.800
 We have cross and mountain bike comfort 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.539
 run update last year 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.800
 have modernized the wheels sizes 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:06.659
 have made outfits in this 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.039
 So we will be a complete design 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:10.169
 to revise that means we have that 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:12.330
 whole program revises new colors 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:12.900
 new design very fresh very nice very much 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.779
 modern 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:18.029
 Let yourself be surprised 

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:20.419
 surprise that the theme much fun on 

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:20.419
 the eurobike
