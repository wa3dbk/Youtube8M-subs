sterilizer nice polishing touch to the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.279 
sterilizer nice polishing touch to the
water<00:00:25.380> but<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.490> claims<00:00:26.760> this<00:00:27.029> 700<00:00:27.660> gallons<00:00:27.810> per

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.930 
water but it claims this 700 gallons per
hour<00:00:28.400> so<00:00:29.400> i'll<00:00:29.580> gunked<00:00:29.970> up<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.269> about<00:00:30.599> 5<00:00:30.929> 600

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
my money but as you see my measuring

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.270 
my money but as you see my measuring
tape<00:00:36.329> down<00:00:36.690> there<00:00:36.870> on<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:36.989> floor<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.070> top

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
tape down there on the floor so the top

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.479 
tape down there on the floor so the top
of<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.430> tapes<00:00:38.640> measure<00:00:38.910> 19<00:00:39.300> inches<00:00:40.370> set<00:00:41.370> at

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
of the tapes measure 19 inches set at

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.690 
of the tapes measure 19 inches set at
the<00:00:41.579> top<00:00:41.850> where<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.180> hinges<00:00:42.690> are<00:00:42.899> red<00:00:43.140> hinges

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
the top where the hinges are red hinges

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.040 
the top where the hinges are red hinges
so<00:00:44.700> then<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:44.969> got<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.270> tubing<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:45.750> we're

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
so then you got the tubing so we're

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.100 
so then you got the tubing so we're
looking<00:00:46.260> about<00:00:46.350> 23<00:00:46.950> inches<00:00:47.899> tubing<00:00:48.899> runs

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
looking about 23 inches tubing runs

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.110 
looking about 23 inches tubing runs
across<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.770> back<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.219> tank<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.940> out

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
across the back of the tank to the out

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.770 
across the back of the tank to the out
to<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:52.110> intake<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.129> there<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:54.030> then<00:00:54.539> we<00:00:54.629> got

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
to the intake in there and then we got

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.520 
to the intake in there and then we got
the<00:00:54.899> power<00:00:55.110> output<00:00:56.120> right<00:00:57.120> there<00:00:57.379> blowing<00:00:58.379> all

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
the power output right there blowing all

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.260 
the power output right there blowing all
the<00:00:58.559> way<00:00:59.129> down<00:00:59.399> at<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.699> bottom<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.120> tank

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
the way down at the bottom of the tank
