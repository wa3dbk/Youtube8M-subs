00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.400
 friends my greetings imagine 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.070
 the situation 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.490
 a person sits behind the wheel of a car sometimes 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.900
 use hard liquor 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.939
 there is no limit to our outrage 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.100
 how can this be punished 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.680
 culprit eggs to the fullest extent of the law 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.990
 but looking ahead I want to tell you 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.410
 the next thing is communication in this case 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.840
 no why one of the conditions was that 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.330
 the driver was sitting in a parked car 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.460
 A DPS inspector who is approached is necessary 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.260
 pass for inspection only civilian 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.190
 passport of the Russian Federation and 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.070
 registration certificate 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.530
 vehicle driving 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.360
 credentials do n't even get that 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.269
 such a driver's license 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.440
 Essentially, this document gives you rights 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.650
 drive a vehicle 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.080
 certain category to manage here 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.729
 the key word we will fire we will ask but how 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.920
 we remember the vehicle 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:06.650
 was in the parking lot and in the moment 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.979
 she was not governed therefore in what 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.140
 state is the driver at such 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.860
 circumstances is not important because we 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.920
 remember that article 12 8 part 1 of the code 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.560
 interactive delinquency robs you 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.560
 rights for the management of transport 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.000
 intoxication agent 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.430
 management again emphasizes the words 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.710
 no other way 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.380
 If the inspector is suddenly correct 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.940
 reason refuses to return you either 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.500
 a passport or a certificate of registration 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.159
 vehicle 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.319
 you can call 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.740
 traded females then steal documents by 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:47.039
 law inspector has the right to withdraw 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.350
 no passport is not lit registration 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.520
 vehicle he is entitled 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.829
 withdraw only driver 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.869
 credentials but how is it again you don't 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.709
 drove the vehicle therefore 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.000
 in this case, the reassurance you don't need 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:02.009
 if still you passed 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.439
 your driverâ€™s inspector 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.450
 identity in these circumstances 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:09.780
 you know that a powerful lever fell into his hands 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.069
 impact in this situation friends 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.069
 be careful
