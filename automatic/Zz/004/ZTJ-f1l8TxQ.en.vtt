00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
incredibly overpowered well the ball is

a<00:00:41.489> little<00:00:41.579> bit<00:00:41.850> stronger<00:00:42.059> than<00:00:42.300> most<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
a little bit stronger than most of the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.840 
a little bit stronger than most of the
other<00:00:42.930> assault<00:00:43.200> rifles<00:00:43.260> but<00:00:43.680> if<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.820> go

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
other assault rifles but if I go

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.000 
other assault rifles but if I go
head-to-head<00:00:45.090> for<00:00:45.629> example<00:00:46.140> at<00:00:46.350> like<00:00:46.620> longer

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
head-to-head for example at like longer

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.580 
head-to-head for example at like longer
range<00:00:47.190> with<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.489> AK<00:00:48.020> and<00:00:49.020> then<00:00:49.140> somebody<00:00:49.350> has

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
range with the AK and then somebody has

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.319 
range with the AK and then somebody has
the<00:00:49.620> ball<00:00:49.890> I'll<00:00:50.309> win<00:00:50.489> with<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.789> AK<00:00:50.910> just

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
the ball I'll win with the AK just

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.790 
the ball I'll win with the AK just
because<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:51.690> it's<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.410> little<00:00:52.620> bit<00:00:52.710> more

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
because it's it's a little bit more

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.760 
because it's it's a little bit more
powerful<00:00:53.250> at<00:00:53.399> range<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.850> think<00:00:54.320> well<00:00:55.320> for<00:00:55.559> me<00:00:55.649> it

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
powerful at range I think well for me it

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.160 
powerful at range I think well for me it
seems<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.129> way<00:00:56.250> anyway<00:00:56.629> so<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.660> can<00:00:57.930> able

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
seems that way anyway so I can able

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.500 
seems that way anyway so I can able
local<00:00:58.829> i'm<00:00:58.949> basically<00:00:59.280> able<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.270> go<00:01:00.390> ahead

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
local i'm basically able to to go ahead

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.880 
local i'm basically able to to go ahead
and<00:01:00.780> kill<00:01:00.899> people<00:01:01.050> at<00:01:01.230> longer<00:01:01.469> range<00:01:01.680> with<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
and kill people at longer range with the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.160 
and kill people at longer range with the
AK<00:01:02.070> compared<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.690> bow<00:01:03.840> but<00:01:04.080> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
AK compared to the to the bow but the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.080 
AK compared to the to the bow but the
ball<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.350> still<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.920> very<00:01:05.280> very<00:01:05.670> good<00:01:05.820> assault

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090

sort of range that that isn't like right

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.940 
sort of range that that isn't like right
into<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.540> in<00:01:33.780> your<00:01:33.990> face<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.500> know<00:01:34.619> if<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.860> go

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
into you in your face you know if you go

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.230 
into you in your face you know if you go
out<00:01:35.070> with<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.220> shotgun<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:35.880> go<00:01:36.030> around

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
out with a shotgun you can go around

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.819 
out with a shotgun you can go around
with<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.450> i<00:01:36.540> think<00:01:36.689> it's<00:01:36.780> called<00:01:36.900> attack<00:01:37.229> 19

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
with it i think it's called attack 19

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.469 
with it i think it's called attack 19
i'm<00:01:37.979> not<00:01:38.100> entirely<00:01:38.280> sure<00:01:38.430> but<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:39.329> basically

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
i'm not entirely sure but it basically

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.410 
i'm not entirely sure but it basically
shoots<00:01:39.900> like<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.140> sound<00:01:40.710> wave<00:01:41.180> it's<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.240> little

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
shoots like a sound wave it's a little

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.060 
shoots like a sound wave it's a little
bit<00:01:42.509> weird<00:01:42.689> but<00:01:42.930> still<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.710> basically<00:01:43.950> just

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
bit weird but still it basically just

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.550 
bit weird but still it basically just
shoots<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.430> sound<00:01:44.640> wave<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.030> it's<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:46.320> bad

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
shoots a sound wave and it's so so bad

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.620 
shoots a sound wave and it's so so bad
you<00:01:46.860> can<00:01:47.009> only<00:01:47.220> kill<00:01:47.490> people<00:01:47.880> with<00:01:48.090> like<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.299> one

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
you can only kill people with like a one

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.630 
you can only kill people with like a one
shot<00:01:48.930> kill<00:01:48.990> if<00:01:49.710> you're<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:50.100> just<00:01:50.340> right<00:01:50.520> up

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
shot kill if you're like just right up

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.280 
shot kill if you're like just right up
in<00:01:50.759> their<00:01:50.880> face<00:01:51.060> if<00:01:51.360> if<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.810> if<00:01:51.840> you're<00:01:52.140> not

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
in their face if if you if you're not

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.899 
in their face if if you if you're not
then<00:01:52.710> you're<00:01:52.890> just<00:01:53.040> gonna<00:01:53.280> get<00:01:53.490> hit<00:01:53.640> markers

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
then you're just gonna get hit markers

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.330 
then you're just gonna get hit markers
for<00:01:54.060> days<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.420> that's<00:01:54.960> pretty<00:01:55.200> much<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:56.070> the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
for days and that's pretty much that the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.459 
for days and that's pretty much that the
whole<00:01:56.549> way<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:57.270> thought<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.840> works<00:01:58.049> like<00:01:58.320> the

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
whole way I thought that works like the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.990 
whole way I thought that works like the
shotguns<00:01:58.829> just<00:01:59.009> are<00:01:59.250> bad<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.820> this<00:01:59.939> game

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
shotguns just are bad in this game

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.600 
shotguns just are bad in this game
snipers<00:02:00.659> are<00:02:00.780> not<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.049> bad<00:02:01.200> either<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:02.250> can

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
snipers are not that bad either you can

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.340 
snipers are not that bad either you can
quick<00:02:02.969> scope<00:02:03.270> but<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.719> kind<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.049> takes<00:02:04.200> a

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
quick scope but it kind of takes a

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.690 
quick scope but it kind of takes a
really<00:02:04.500> long<00:02:04.590> time<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.890> actually<00:02:05.070> use<00:02:05.520> to

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
really long time to actually use to

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.999 
really long time to actually use to
quickscope<00:02:06.060> properly<00:02:06.500> even<00:02:07.500> right<00:02:07.770> now<00:02:07.890> I've

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
quickscope properly even right now I've

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.410 
quickscope properly even right now I've
been<00:02:08.039> playing<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.459> game<00:02:08.580> just<00:02:08.970> gave<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.179> bunch

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
been playing this game just gave a bunch

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.449 
been playing this game just gave a bunch
i<00:02:09.629> still<00:02:10.259> haven't<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.890> know<00:02:10.979> managed<00:02:11.340> to

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
i still haven't you know managed to

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.140 
i still haven't you know managed to
figure<00:02:11.610> out<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.879> snipers<00:02:12.270> too<00:02:12.569> much

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
figure out the snipers too much

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.449 
figure out the snipers too much
like<00:02:13.989> I've<00:02:14.110> been<00:02:14.200> playing<00:02:14.349> with<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.650> I<00:02:15.250> think

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
like I've been playing with the I think

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.759 
like I've been playing with the I think
it's<00:02:15.549> called<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:15.790> Moore's<00:02:16.079> rifle<00:02:17.079> and<00:02:17.260> that's

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
it's called a Moore's rifle and that's

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.100 
it's called a Moore's rifle and that's
pretty<00:02:18.069> much<00:02:18.189> like<00:02:18.400> that<00:02:18.549> the<00:02:18.730> one<00:02:18.909> shot<00:02:19.150> or

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
pretty much like that the one shot or

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.110 
pretty much like that the one shot or
what's<00:02:21.010> called<00:02:21.129> like<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.519> bolt<00:02:21.730> action

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
what's called like the bolt action

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.399 
what's called like the bolt action
sniper<00:02:22.239> thats<00:02:22.629> in<00:02:22.750> this<00:02:22.840> game<00:02:22.930> which<00:02:23.379> is

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
sniper thats in this game which is

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.080 
sniper thats in this game which is
really<00:02:23.799> bolt-action<00:02:24.189> well<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.700> kind<00:02:24.879> of<00:02:24.970> is

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
really bolt-action well the kind of is

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.360 
really bolt-action well the kind of is
but<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:25.510> it's<00:02:25.959> only<00:02:26.110> like<00:02:26.319> a<00:02:26.349> one<00:02:26.650> shot<00:02:27.010> and

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
but you it's only like a one shot and

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.580 
but you it's only like a one shot and
then<00:02:27.849> you<00:02:27.909> have<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.120> like<00:02:28.269> reload<00:02:28.780> a<00:02:28.989> round

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
then you have to like reload a round

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.789 
then you have to like reload a round
into<00:02:29.829> the<00:02:29.950> chamber<00:02:30.040> again<00:02:30.640> so<00:02:31.170> anyway<00:02:32.170> so<00:02:32.590> is

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
into the chamber again so anyway so is

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.860 
into the chamber again so anyway so is
that's<00:02:33.340> basically<00:02:33.819> how<00:02:33.909> it<00:02:34.000> is<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:34.359> doesn't

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
that's basically how it is it doesn't

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.559 
that's basically how it is it doesn't
have<00:02:34.959> like<00:02:35.109> a<00:02:35.290> magazine<00:02:35.829> anyway<00:02:36.510> let's<00:02:37.510> get

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
have like a magazine anyway let's get

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.030 
have like a magazine anyway let's get
out<00:02:37.689> the<00:02:37.750> light<00:02:37.930> compensation<00:02:38.560> so<00:02:38.709> that's<00:02:38.890> the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
out the light compensation so that's the

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.649 
out the light compensation so that's the
one<00:02:39.250> thing<00:02:39.430> I<00:02:39.609> absolutely<00:02:40.060> despise<00:02:40.209> about

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:40.659 
one thing I absolutely despise about

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:41.910 
one thing I absolutely despise about
this<00:02:40.780> game<00:02:40.930> right<00:02:41.049> now<00:02:41.109> it<00:02:41.379> i<00:02:41.530> think<00:02:41.739> it's<00:02:41.859> the

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
this game right now it i think it's the

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.860 
this game right now it i think it's the
worst<00:02:42.280> it's<00:02:42.489> been<00:02:42.579> in<00:02:42.640> every<00:02:43.090> slight<00:02:43.359> in<00:02:43.659> any

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
worst it's been in every slight in any

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.629 
worst it's been in every slight in any
call<00:02:44.140> of<00:02:44.230> duty<00:02:44.470> it's<00:02:45.010> absolutely<00:02:45.609> ridiculous

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:45.639 
call of duty it's absolutely ridiculous

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:47.520 
call of duty it's absolutely ridiculous
to<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.209> shoot<00:02:46.599> at<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:46.780> person<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:47.260> start

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
to you shoot at a person you start

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.869 
to you shoot at a person you start
shooting<00:02:47.859> you<00:02:47.980> get<00:02:48.099> the<00:02:48.220> first<00:02:48.370> shots<00:02:48.670> on<00:02:48.849> a

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
shooting you get the first shots on a

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.180 
shooting you get the first shots on a
person<00:02:49.359> you<00:02:49.480> even<00:02:49.659> get<00:02:49.810> hit<00:02:49.959> markers<00:02:50.319> and<00:02:50.500> then

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
person you even get hit markers and then

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.759 
person you even get hit markers and then
he<00:02:51.400> destroys<00:02:52.000> you<00:02:52.180> like<00:02:52.569> instantly<00:02:53.079> and<00:02:53.290> it's

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
he destroys you like instantly and it's

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:54.960 
he destroys you like instantly and it's
absolutely<00:02:54.129> ridiculous<00:02:54.159> getting<00:02:54.790> into

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
absolutely ridiculous getting into

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.129 
absolutely ridiculous getting into
gunfights<00:02:55.329> like<00:02:55.450> that<00:02:55.599> it<00:02:55.720> is<00:02:55.959> just

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139 
gunfights like that it is just

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:57.990
