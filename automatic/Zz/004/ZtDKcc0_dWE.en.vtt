00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.910

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.550

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.740
 they go through something and that sometimes 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.110
 people that come into your life and it's because of 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:09.230
 one reason and that sometimes 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.120
 it is necessary to take some detours to 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.210
 get to your destination entrance the 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.820
 edition is beautiful anyone who sees it 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.190
 in a bookstore he will fall in love with him 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.130
 and it's not all inside it's just like 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:26.990
 beautiful has pictures of the places 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.729
 who visited have the tickets of the 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.000
 places to which were those of the 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.450
 food 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.570
 they ate during during the trip and 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.820
 the best the playlist that it has is almost 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.530
 for the playlist of roger but also 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.000
 there 's inning what happens is that amy is 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:48.820
 more like music this the two have 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.890
 super different tastes in music but 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.810
 they are adapting I am told 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.170
 from the point of view of me and of 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.869
 it suddenly has its phases back 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:03.070
 and I'm left with it and my house now 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.030
 always makes mention of that in such 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.420
 situation 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.420
 amy from the past would have acted from this 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.300
 way but that and my past no longer 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.360
 There is a book of love but love 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:20.690
 happens in the background love is giving 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:23.840
 little by little and it's like 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.230
 you say okay and this had to happen in 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.900
 some point of the book but I love 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.950
 how the characters get to know each other 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:37.180
 same and roger how they adapt from certain 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.180
 way one another 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:44.849
 as in my managing to leave removing their 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.920
 insecurities that fear facing their 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.780
 fears and insecurities if by her 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.170
 he would have stayed all summer in his 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.049
 home regretting what happened 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.200
 but instead his mom in a certain way 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.830
 it was like we're going to move, we 're going to 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.630
 start again 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.630
 and you have to take the car 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.120
 could have gone by plane and that 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.940
 someone else will take the car and he had me 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.790
 to be a co-pilot of co-pilot in that 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.490
 trip the truth is that it feels 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.080
 pretty book you enjoy it but you 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.900
 it arrives in a certain way and in the books 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.860
 of neo platform always always you 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.800
 they like they have something that they get to you or 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.290
 they click you instantly amy it's not the 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.300
 funniest person on the planet but 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.070
 what I like is that from the beginning 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.430
 tell you why 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.770
 Amy, that's how you understand and put yourself in 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.690
 your place in the situation where you are 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.840
 living is amazing how life te 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:49.460
 change in a second and then two days 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:53.250
 let's say two people that amy already 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:55.320
 knows Roger but also what 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.900
 that is while I was reading it was 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.600
 as if there will be love between these two 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.880
 characters or there will be no things and if I 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:07.230
 it left as it is a suspense the way 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:12.349
 in which their relationship develops 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.349
 It is very beautiful is step by step 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:20.239
 and as in a certain way 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:22.370
 alone amy manages to take out everything she brings and 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.050
 can overcome it and well that's all 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.060
 what I have to tell you about me roger 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.970
 Super truth would recommend that 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.380
 is a book that will fascinate you 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.740
 done when you finish reading it can 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.330
 that I want I need to have a trip in 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.020
 road especially with someone like 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.789
 roger that is 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.770
 and well it is to say everything for this 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:44.240
