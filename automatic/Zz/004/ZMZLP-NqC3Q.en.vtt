00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:04.280
 But 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.280
 I am a mountain 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:16.579
 Go to Beijing Park 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:18.550
 Walk and raise the cat 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.509
 And 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:20.890
 First class first 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.720
 And there is a thirteen and one phase 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.150
 It is a mask that reproduces the thought map sock and struggles 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.060
 First of all for the first run 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.029
 Roughly 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.820
 Can accelerate 21.2 meters per second 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.350
 In the walk 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.570
 It is around here 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.710
 Instruction .75 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.920
 We can accelerate the three temples 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.420
 Five pairs can accelerate in front of .6 meters 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.000
 Edo and 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.840
 Basic conquest 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.970
 Around 2.5 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.450
 I do not like p. 5mm, and roughly in the 13th 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.850
 It is in front of the famous store Saint Peter 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.250
 to max speed 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.260
 I can understand but 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.440
 When it becomes famous store 3 meters a second 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.770
 Operating profit 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.580
 I don't know this, but I have one step 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.560
 The seat is getting more and more influential 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.590
 Is off 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.009
 Show the station 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.330
 And generally with max speed as a weapon 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.990
 Because 0 point 3 meters per second brake is applied 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.770
 4 carat of acceleration 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.930
 And this hit when the first power is the same 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.930
 It means that the speed of this ob becomes max speed 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.510
 Why speed practice is important? 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.420
 This is an Olympic player but 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.860
 That girl player 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.860
 A tall player substitutes 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.730
 When reaching 7 meters per second 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.730
 Ghost. I can accelerate only 3 meters. 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.390
 So I can only give power to the moving people 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.040
 Is it 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.340
 But Olympic players 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.210
 When I lost the hayter meters ago I lost 2.6 meters in front of 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.609
 Can be observed 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:13.459
 Cutting that can accelerate to the ground moving fast 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.909
 Article 2 that says how much you can get health and strength 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.909
 How much to the ground moving this year early 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.599
 I wonder if you are throwing 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.439
 I need training for such places 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.409
 If it is a country again, let's say 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.299
 I tried to keep pace 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.429
 after all 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:34.039
 That's the only thing like that 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:39.379
 Always at 1.8 and thus when running inside s 28 m further 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.119
 In fact it is to accelerate 

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:43.859
 You can not see this unless you run it at maximum speed 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.979
 It's a technology 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:49.039
 Run slowly during winter and wear the form 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:51.569
 It is a lease 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.129
 If yes gainax speed 10 around 1.8 around this 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.469
 Even if you want to run, you want to run up 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:03.959
 Or players who want to make a big business every second 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:08.879
 We need to accelerate further around here 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.779
 Ne 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:14.059
 I want you to have a good look at that source, though 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.929
 If you don't do your best, you won't be there soon 

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:19.689
 Indicates that 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:21.629
 One day this is how to step 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.059
 That good player might have killed four people, though 

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:26.219
 Speed â€‹â€‹practice 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:27.879
 As it is really necessary 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:29.819
 I think if you say 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.819
 Let's support it again 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:38.909
 I am a mountain
