00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
commentary and this time I am actually

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.519 
commentary and this time I am actually
using<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:17.160> mortar<00:00:17.970> so<00:00:18.300> let's<00:00:18.480> check<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.439> out

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
using the mortar so let's check it out

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.470 
using the mortar so let's check it out
see<00:00:19.860> how<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.070> works<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.550> can't<00:00:21.090> shoot<00:00:21.270> back

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
see how it works I can't shoot back

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.249 
see how it works I can't shoot back
there<00:00:21.750> I<00:00:21.990> can<00:00:22.619> shoot<00:00:22.829> there<00:00:23.930> looks<00:00:24.930> like<00:00:25.079> my

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:25.259 
there I can shoot there looks like my

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:26.779 
there I can shoot there looks like my
squads<00:00:25.740> having<00:00:26.010> some<00:00:26.189> trouble<00:00:26.490> with<00:00:26.580> guys

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
squads having some trouble with guys

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.310 
squads having some trouble with guys
right<00:00:26.970> here<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:27.480> let's<00:00:27.599> go<00:00:27.720> ahead<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:27.900> try<00:00:28.109> and

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
right here so let's go ahead and try and

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.380 
right here so let's go ahead and try and
soften<00:00:29.099> those<00:00:29.400> guys<00:00:29.670> up<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.939> little<00:00:29.970> bit<00:00:30.240> there

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
soften those guys up a little bit there

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.710 
soften those guys up a little bit there
we<00:00:30.509> go<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.810> seems<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.349> me<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.970> the<00:00:32.970> mortar<00:00:33.480> is

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
we go it seems to me that the mortar is

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.390 
we go it seems to me that the mortar is
accurate<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.650> closer<00:00:34.949> you<00:00:35.250> are<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:37.220> to<00:00:38.220> your

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.400 
accurate the closer you are to to your

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.369 
accurate the closer you are to to your
target<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.970> it's<00:00:39.269> less<00:00:39.720> accurate<00:00:40.230> as

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
target and it's less accurate as

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.440 
target and it's less accurate as
distance<00:00:40.890> increases<00:00:41.010> which<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:42.180> know<00:00:42.270> makes

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
distance increases which you know makes

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.080 
distance increases which you know makes
sense<00:00:42.780> considering<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:44.280> has<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.430> long<00:00:44.730> distance

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
sense considering it has a long distance

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.760 
sense considering it has a long distance
to<00:00:45.120> travel<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:45.660> let's<00:00:45.780> try<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.110> get<00:00:46.170> these

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
to travel so let's try and get these

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.729 
to travel so let's try and get these
guys<00:00:47.010> on<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:47.340> rock<00:00:47.610> right<00:00:47.640> here<00:00:48.649> given<00:00:49.649> my

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
guys on this rock right here given my

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.560 
guys on this rock right here given my
team<00:00:50.010> some<00:00:50.250> serious<00:00:50.640> trouble<00:00:50.850> as<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.480> can

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
team some serious trouble as you can

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.180 
team some serious trouble as you can
hear<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.870> mortar<00:00:52.170> sound<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.649> kind<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.920> sounds

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
hear the mortar sound it kind of sounds

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.880 
hear the mortar sound it kind of sounds
incomplete<00:00:53.670> like<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.030> has<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.210> little<00:00:54.449> whistle

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
incomplete like it has a little whistle

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.840 
incomplete like it has a little whistle
but<00:00:55.890> then<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.129> kind<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.309> just<00:00:56.460> cuts<00:00:56.699> off

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
but then it kind of just cuts off

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.520 
but then it kind of just cuts off
abruptly<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.719> don't<00:00:57.870> know<00:00:57.930> if<00:00:58.020> that's<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.260> glitch

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
abruptly I don't know if that's a glitch

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.319 
abruptly I don't know if that's a glitch
or<00:00:58.710> how<00:00:58.800> they<00:00:58.949> intended<00:00:59.430> but<00:00:59.640> that's<00:01:00.239> just

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
or how they intended but that's just

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.880 
or how they intended but that's just
what<00:01:00.539> I've<00:01:00.629> noticed<00:01:01.910> so<00:01:02.910> basically<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:04.739> way<00:01:04.860> I

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
what I've noticed so basically the way I

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.279 
what I've noticed so basically the way I
see<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.430> playing<00:01:06.240> out<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.690> that<00:01:06.899> it's<00:01:07.140> very

00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:07.289 
see this playing out is that it's very

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:11.060 
see this playing out is that it's very
very<00:01:08.190> powerful<00:01:08.690> close<00:01:09.690> range<00:01:10.020> as<00:01:10.259> in<00:01:10.679> very

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
very powerful close range as in very

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.430 
very powerful close range as in very
powerful<00:01:11.580> close<00:01:11.789> range<00:01:12.090> but<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.539> am<00:01:12.899> also<00:01:13.050> in<00:01:13.380> a

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
powerful close range but I am also in a

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.810 
powerful close range but I am also in a
pretty<00:01:13.619> dangerous<00:01:13.890> position<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.580> can<00:01:14.729> get

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
pretty dangerous position I can get

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.999 
pretty dangerous position I can get
killed<00:01:15.170> fairly<00:01:16.170> easily<00:01:16.350> where<00:01:16.740> I'm<00:01:16.830> at<00:01:16.979> right

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
killed fairly easily where I'm at right

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.130 
killed fairly easily where I'm at right
now<00:01:17.220> if<00:01:17.759> they<00:01:18.000> just<00:01:18.150> pushed<00:01:18.450> over<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.869> Ridge

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
now if they just pushed over this Ridge

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.770 
now if they just pushed over this Ridge
and<00:01:19.470> decided<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.920> take<00:01:20.070> me<00:01:20.280> out<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.570> mean

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
and decided to take me out so I mean

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.140 
and decided to take me out so I mean
it's<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.229> give<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.650> take<00:01:22.799> powerful<00:01:23.610> but<00:01:24.000> you

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
it's that give and take powerful but you

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.850 
it's that give and take powerful but you
can<00:01:24.299> also<00:01:24.450> be<00:01:24.810> very<00:01:24.990> vulnerable<00:01:25.320> because<00:01:25.680> I

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
can also be very vulnerable because I

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.890 
can also be very vulnerable because I
mean<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.100> can't<00:01:26.310> really<00:01:26.460> run<00:01:26.700> away<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.600> can't

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
mean you can't really run away you can't

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.510 
mean you can't really run away you can't
you<00:01:28.350> can't<00:01:28.590> move<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.040> don't<00:01:29.189> have<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> lot<00:01:29.490> of

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
you can't move you don't have a lot of

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.219 
you can't move you don't have a lot of
sight<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:30.030> people<00:01:30.299> coming<00:01:30.540> up<00:01:30.630> behind<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:31.049> to

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
sight on people coming up behind you to

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.179 
sight on people coming up behind you to
your<00:01:31.259> sides<00:01:33.049> also<00:01:34.049> I've<00:01:34.500> noticed<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:34.979> it's

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
your sides also I've noticed that it's

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.940 
your sides also I've noticed that it's
very<00:01:35.520> very<00:01:35.970> inaccurate<00:01:36.360> at<00:01:36.780> long<00:01:37.320> ranges<00:01:37.740> so

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
very very inaccurate at long ranges so

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.740 
very very inaccurate at long ranges so
if<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.430> aimed<00:01:38.670> at<00:01:38.820> someone<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.149> here<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.360> probably

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
if I aimed at someone in here I probably

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.389 
if I aimed at someone in here I probably
wouldn't<00:01:40.110> even<00:01:40.140> kill<00:01:40.530> them<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.220> mean

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
wouldn't even kill them so I mean

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.880 
wouldn't even kill them so I mean
there's<00:01:41.549> almost<00:01:41.670> no<00:01:42.000> point<00:01:42.079> trying<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.320> aim<00:01:43.500> at

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
there's almost no point trying to aim at

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.399 
there's almost no point trying to aim at
these<00:01:44.280> guys<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:44.759> here<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.810> mean<00:01:46.020> at<00:01:46.200> long

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
these guys in here so I mean at long

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.870 
these guys in here so I mean at long
ranges<00:01:46.799> it's<00:01:46.979> not<00:01:47.130> like<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.369> can<00:01:47.460> just<00:01:47.520> sit

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
ranges it's not like you can just sit

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.990 
ranges it's not like you can just sit
inside<00:01:48.000> your<00:01:48.299> base<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:49.189> can't<00:01:50.189> because<00:01:50.909> you

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
inside your base and can't because you

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.510 
inside your base and can't because you
can't<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:52.079> just<00:01:52.259> can't<00:01:52.469> it's<00:01:52.710> not<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:53.250> you

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520
