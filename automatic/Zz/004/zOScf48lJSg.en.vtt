00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:09.540
 or play two times 9 24 9 25 how do 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.889
 you saw if the truth is that a match 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.540
 unusual but good was important 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.810
 win and luckily it got so 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.340
 we had to be calm the goal 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.140
 worse could I get there I could not reach 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.340
 good luckily he arrived so happy 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.500
 for the hard win out there 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.779
 it costs the idea is that not but good for 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.699
 there it takes a few minutes to enter 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.099
 party sometimes and now there was no 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.379
 time to take to enter the 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.850
 party because already the time that 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.070
 we started already finished but good for 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.839
 lucky I think the team within all 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.699
 He is tall and could eyes he could make the game 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:43.769
 that we have been trying to do well 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.930
 adding confidence in the performance each 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.640
 you can see them very well and also points 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.580
 to come out champion long ago the 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.470
 restaurant or yes yes the truth that 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.330
 we come well we come well individual and 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.119
 In group I think that the team 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.710
 come playing well that gives confidence to 

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:01.710
 each one to do the things that are going 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.150
 to do and if we come to win for their 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.769
 it's been a long time since we lost what 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.200
 important and we have been winning by adding 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.860
 points and good waiting for that central 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.080
 lose some point personally as 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.880
 Your moment says the reservation has many 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.800
 minutes everything to emiliana good and you see 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.300
 they have a very good level how do you 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.970
 you feel yes yes the truth that we came 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.800
 playing both the two there in the middle 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.160
 we were doing fine we are adapting 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.780
 we are like this with confidence to the two as 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.300
 all the equipment and good now you are 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.430
 touching the to be in the bank so 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.110
 all luck to him as you describe 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.760
 as a player if in your midfield 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.220
 central for fans that you do not 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.990
 know that a midfielder is still 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.490
 central that now out there sometimes when 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.380
 I was playing Chinese I had a 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.690
 little more outside a little more loose 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.009
 but more than anything I'm trying to 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.160
 play there in the middle of being well 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.170
 stop and remove and touch as much 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.820
 simple possible the difference that maybe 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.899
 he has more mark to you you like more the 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:59.210
 game has that best touch if out there 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.740
 he is a little more than mark me and I 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.899
 out there to play a little more for that 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.149
 I think we're doing well these 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.460
 last matches two or three dates ago 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.800
 back is not happy that the 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.150
 lower guys have their place because 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.640
 think that at some point you can 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.960
 touch one so good you have to be 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.690
 quiet wish that at some point he 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.250
 of that opportunity and good waiting for the 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.110
 today doing things trying to do 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.120
 things well here in reserve that comes 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.830
 squires the parties and besides that 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.080
 have you had a trip to san luis and have 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.790
 added minutes in a friendly also you 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.620
 they are happy in what can be a 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.020
 preseason that can add you to the 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.420
 half of the year yes yes the truth that this 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.100
 it's good I was very happy the 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.650
 experience of san luis was it was very 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.570
 pretty so come and see people from the 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.240
 first as the pitch comes as it comes 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.920
 both parties to one still do not 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.350
 like out there also give it a little more 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.050
 of base without motivation but good that 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.350
 they are looking at us is not the one that is the 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.300
 I dream the goal to fulfill now short 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.880

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.910
 first time campus be quiet 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.650

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.250
