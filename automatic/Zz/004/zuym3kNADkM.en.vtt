hi<00:00:00.329> I'm<00:00:00.690> Steve<00:00:00.989> Johnson<00:00:01.469> we're<00:00:01.740> going<00:00:01.860> to<00:00:01.920> look

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
hi I'm Steve Johnson we're going to look

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.249 
hi I'm Steve Johnson we're going to look
at<00:00:02.190> some<00:00:02.399> battery<00:00:02.909> or<00:00:03.060> magnet<00:00:03.480> experiments

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
at some battery or magnet experiments

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.070 
at some battery or magnet experiments
now<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.190> first<00:00:05.460> thing<00:00:05.700> let's<00:00:06.600> keep<00:00:06.839> this

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
now the first thing let's keep this

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.379 
now the first thing let's keep this
simple<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.770> let's<00:00:08.010> use<00:00:08.580> things<00:00:08.940> which<00:00:09.179> we

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
simple and let's use things which we

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.470 
simple and let's use things which we
will<00:00:09.570> find<00:00:09.870> commonly<00:00:10.380> around<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.769> home

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 
will find commonly around the home

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.539 
will find commonly around the home
electric<00:00:12.480> wire<00:00:12.780> there's<00:00:13.410> often<00:00:13.740> bits<00:00:13.980> ends<00:00:14.460> of

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
electric wire there's often bits ends of

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.570 
electric wire there's often bits ends of
electric<00:00:14.969> wire<00:00:15.020> sells<00:00:16.020> out<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.680> batteries<00:00:17.220> and

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
electric wire sells out of batteries and

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.920 
electric wire sells out of batteries and
so<00:00:18.090> on<00:00:18.270> yeah

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
so on yeah

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.970 
so on yeah
nails<00:00:19.789> paperclips<00:00:20.840> pencils<00:00:21.840> cardboard<00:00:22.650> tubes

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
nails paperclips pencils cardboard tubes

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.540 
nails paperclips pencils cardboard tubes
they're<00:00:23.730> all<00:00:23.850> in<00:00:24.060> your<00:00:24.240> home<00:00:24.449> right<00:00:25.160> and<00:00:26.160> for

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
they're all in your home right and for

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.580 
they're all in your home right and for
these<00:00:26.760> things<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.359> can<00:00:27.570> make<00:00:27.750> such<00:00:28.109> simple

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
these things you can make such simple

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.700 
these things you can make such simple
things<00:00:28.619> as<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.240> magnet<00:00:30.240> from<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.660> nail<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.590> a

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
things as a magnet from a nail and a

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.389 
things as a magnet from a nail and a
piece<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.130> wire<00:00:32.930> simply<00:00:33.930> by<00:00:34.190> taking<00:00:35.190> their

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
piece of wire simply by taking their

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.639 
piece of wire simply by taking their
nail<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:37.100> wrapping<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.489> wire<00:00:39.450> around<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.410> and

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
nail and wrapping the wire around it and

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.420 
nail and wrapping the wire around it and
then<00:00:41.460> attaching<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.989> battery<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.860> that

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
then attaching it to a battery and that

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.569 
then attaching it to a battery and that
makes<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.969> simple<00:00:45.390> magnet<00:00:46.010> using<00:00:47.010> this<00:00:47.309> of

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
makes a simple magnet using this of

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.619 
makes a simple magnet using this of
course<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:48.030> can<00:00:48.270> pick<00:00:48.539> up<00:00:48.719> paperclips<00:00:49.410> and

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
course you can pick up paperclips and

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.600 
course you can pick up paperclips and
that<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.809> part<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.289> my<00:00:52.530> shopping<00:00:53.129> list<00:00:53.489> you

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
that is part of my shopping list you

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.700 
that is part of my shopping list you
might<00:00:53.760> say<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.719> that's<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.350> good<00:00:55.559> little

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
might say so that's a good little

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.010 
might say so that's a good little
experiment<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.550> do<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.270> can<00:00:57.480> investigate

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
experiment to do and you can investigate

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.529 
experiment to do and you can investigate
the<00:00:58.890> strength<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.670> magnet<00:01:00.030> how<00:01:00.329> many

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
the strength of the magnet how many

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.319 
the strength of the magnet how many
paper<00:01:00.840> clips<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.559> can<00:01:01.829> pick<00:01:02.370> up<00:01:02.399> by

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
paper clips you can pick up by

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.140 
paper clips you can pick up by
increasing<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.409> number<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.830> turns<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.549> by

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
increasing the number of turns and by

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.380 
increasing the number of turns and by
changing<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.140> number<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.400> batteries<00:01:08.700> that

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
changing the number of batteries that

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.250 
changing the number of batteries that
you're<00:01:10.070> pushing<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.189> current<00:01:11.490> through<00:01:11.700> with

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
you're pushing the current through with

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.960 
you're pushing the current through with
you'll<00:01:13.260> also<00:01:13.470> find<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.310> you're<00:01:14.490> actually

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
you'll also find that you're actually

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.210 
you'll also find that you're actually
investigating<00:01:15.840> heating<00:01:16.530> up<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.979> wire

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
investigating heating up of a wire

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.920 
investigating heating up of a wire
because<00:01:17.640> you'll<00:01:17.790> find<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.240> will<00:01:18.450> get<00:01:18.630> pretty

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
because you'll find this will get pretty

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.710 
because you'll find this will get pretty
hot<00:01:19.290> when<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.100> do<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.520> don't<00:01:21.299> let<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.600> get

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
hot when you do it and don't let it get

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.380 
hot when you do it and don't let it get
too<00:01:21.930> hot<00:01:22.140> it'll<00:01:22.380> melt<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.890> wire<00:01:23.210> so<00:01:24.210> that's

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
too hot it'll melt the wire so that's

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.270 
too hot it'll melt the wire so that's
one<00:01:24.600> kind<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.960> thing<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.380> can<00:01:25.560> do<00:01:25.770> with<00:01:26.250> a

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
one kind of thing that you can do with a

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.609 
one kind of thing that you can do with a
battery<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.240> magnet<00:01:27.600> but<00:01:27.780> there<00:01:28.140> are<00:01:28.290> other

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
battery and a magnet but there are other

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.460 
battery and a magnet but there are other
things<00:01:29.040> if<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.970> get<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> sheet<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.720> paper<00:01:30.990> for

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
things if you get a sheet of paper for

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.109 
things if you get a sheet of paper for
example<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.540> if<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.750> take<00:01:34.140> your<00:01:34.880> magnet<00:01:35.880> with

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
example and if you take your magnet with

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.050 
example and if you take your magnet with
its<00:01:36.150> coil<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.900> put<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.290> underneath<00:01:37.939> put<00:01:38.939> it

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
its coil and put it underneath put it

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.170 
its coil and put it underneath put it
underneath<00:01:39.570> here<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:41.009> here<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.549> your<00:01:41.700> magnet

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
underneath here so here is your magnet

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.170 
underneath here so here is your magnet
and<00:01:42.299> it's<00:01:42.420> working<00:01:42.920> now<00:01:43.979> what<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.729> need<00:01:44.909> for

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
and it's working now what you need for

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.210 
and it's working now what you need for
this<00:01:45.299> are<00:01:45.979> iron<00:01:47.090> filings<00:01:48.090> now<00:01:49.079> iron<00:01:49.560> filings

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
this are iron filings now iron filings

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.429 
this are iron filings now iron filings
so<00:01:50.399> what<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.790> get<00:01:51.090> when<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.659> get<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.530> rasp<00:01:53.220> or<00:01:53.670> a

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
so what you get when you get a rasp or a

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.980 
so what you get when you get a rasp or a
for<00:01:55.439> for<00:01:55.799> rasping<00:01:56.340> metal<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.479> rasp<00:01:57.780> it

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
for for rasping metal and you rasp it

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.050 
for for rasping metal and you rasp it
and<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.350> rest<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.920> iron<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.790> get<00:01:59.939> these

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
and you rest the iron and you get these

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.060 
and you rest the iron and you get these
little<00:02:00.390> bits<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.719> iron<00:02:00.930> those<00:02:01.590> are<00:02:01.770> iron

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
little bits of iron those are iron

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.090 
little bits of iron those are iron
filings<00:02:02.729> use<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> rasp<00:02:03.420> or<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.689> file<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.710> file

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
filings use a rasp or a file you file

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.850 
filings use a rasp or a file you file
them<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:06.149> can<00:02:06.360> sprinkle<00:02:07.140> these<00:02:07.290> over<00:02:07.740> the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
them and you can sprinkle these over the

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.460 
them and you can sprinkle these over the
top<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.459> if<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.450> sprinkle<00:02:09.840> them<00:02:10.140> over<00:02:10.289> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
top and if you sprinkle them over the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.650 
top and if you sprinkle them over the
top<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.069> set<00:02:11.489> your<00:02:11.700> current<00:02:12.030> running

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
top and you set your current running

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.490 
top and you set your current running
in<00:02:12.780> this<00:02:12.990> and<00:02:13.590> then<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.460> just<00:02:14.700> tap<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.540> maybe

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
in this and then you just tap this maybe

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.860 
in this and then you just tap this maybe
cardboard<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.370> better<00:02:17.610> but<00:02:17.940> you<00:02:18.150> just<00:02:18.450> tapped

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
cardboard is better but you just tapped

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.740 
cardboard is better but you just tapped
this<00:02:19.140> you'll<00:02:19.830> find<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:20.370> get<00:02:20.580> a<00:02:20.880> pattern<00:02:21.540> and

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
this you'll find you get a pattern and

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.510 
this you'll find you get a pattern and
the<00:02:22.200> pattern<00:02:22.230> will<00:02:22.710> look<00:02:23.010> something<00:02:23.490> like

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
the pattern will look something like

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.440 
the pattern will look something like
this<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.450> this<00:02:25.170> will<00:02:25.440> show<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.450> magnetic

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
this and this will show you the magnetic

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.320 
this and this will show you the magnetic
field<00:02:27.840> lines<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.710> can't<00:02:28.980> see<00:02:29.370> them<00:02:29.670> but<00:02:30.120> this

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
field lines you can't see them but this

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.690 
field lines you can't see them but this
shows<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:30.930> what<00:02:31.260> they<00:02:31.470> look<00:02:31.710> like<00:02:31.740> and<00:02:32.250> this

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
shows you what they look like and this

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.900 
shows you what they look like and this
is<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:32.910> very<00:02:33.150> simple<00:02:33.540> experiment<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.200> do<00:02:34.640> if<00:02:35.640> you

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
is a very simple experiment to do if you

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.020 
is a very simple experiment to do if you
want<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.240> make<00:02:36.420> this<00:02:36.630> permanent<00:02:37.400> if<00:02:38.400> you're

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
want to make this permanent if you're

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.600 
want to make this permanent if you're
very<00:02:39.330> clever<00:02:39.690> you<00:02:40.080> do<00:02:40.650> this<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.070> then<00:02:41.160> lift<00:02:41.430> it

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
very clever you do this and then lift it

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.910 
very clever you do this and then lift it
off<00:02:41.820> all<00:02:42.240> you<00:02:42.420> have<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:42.990> do<00:02:43.170> is<00:02:43.350> get<00:02:43.590> some<00:02:43.860> of

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
off all you have to do is get some of

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.940 
off all you have to do is get some of
this<00:02:44.420> sticky<00:02:45.420> backed<00:02:45.660> plastic<00:02:46.350> clear<00:02:46.920> plastic

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
this sticky backed plastic clear plastic

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.560 
this sticky backed plastic clear plastic
and<00:02:48.650> very<00:02:49.650> carefully<00:02:50.310> just<00:02:50.340> put<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.120> over<00:02:51.240> the

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
and very carefully just put it over the

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.050 
and very carefully just put it over the
top<00:02:51.810> press<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:52.740> down<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.250> there<00:02:53.820> you'll<00:02:54.030> have

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
top press it down and there you'll have

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.900 
top press it down and there you'll have
the<00:02:54.840> impression<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:56.040> magnetic<00:02:56.610> field

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
the impression of the magnetic field

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.880 
the impression of the magnetic field
around<00:02:57.120> your<00:02:57.810> electromagnet

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
around your electromagnet

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.050 
around your electromagnet
so<00:02:58.980> that's<00:02:59.190> some<00:02:59.520> of<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.670> kind<00:02:59.970> of

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
so that's some of the kind of

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.630 
so that's some of the kind of
experiments<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:01.020> can<00:03:01.050> do<00:03:01.500> with<00:03:01.740> batteries

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
experiments you can do with batteries

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.480 
experiments you can do with batteries
and<00:03:02.970> magnets
