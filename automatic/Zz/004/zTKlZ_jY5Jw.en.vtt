about the same as what you'd expect from

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:24.219 
about the same as what you'd expect from
a<00:01:15.150> ductless<00:01:19.220> this<00:01:20.220> has<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.610> condenser<00:01:21.060> fans

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.800 

unit<00:01:24.890> will<00:01:25.009> blow<00:01:25.220> about<00:01:25.340> 3,000<00:01:26.060> CFM<00:01:26.509> the

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
unit will blow about 3,000 CFM the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.899 
unit will blow about 3,000 CFM the
reason<00:01:27.049> why<00:01:27.170> it's<00:01:27.320> a<00:01:27.409> double<00:01:27.710> stack<00:01:27.979> fidgets

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
reason why it's a double stack fidgets

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.880 
reason why it's a double stack fidgets
who<00:01:29.030> kind<00:01:29.210> of<00:01:29.270> learn<00:01:29.390> their<00:01:29.600> lesson<00:01:29.990> they<00:01:30.680> went

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
who kind of learn their lesson they went

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.450 
who kind of learn their lesson they went
with<00:01:31.040> a<00:01:31.070> single<00:01:31.549> larger<00:01:32.150> fan<00:01:32.360> but<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:34.040> fan<00:01:34.280> was

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
with a single larger fan but the fan was

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.730 
with a single larger fan but the fan was
coming<00:01:35.180> off<00:01:35.299> of<00:01:35.479> its<00:01:35.630> hinges<00:01:35.750> because<00:01:36.080> it<00:01:36.409> has

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
coming off of its hinges because it has

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.270 
coming off of its hinges because it has
to<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.670> RPMs<00:01:38.119> are<00:01:38.270> just<00:01:38.420> too<00:01:38.540> much<00:01:38.689> so<00:01:39.190> with<00:01:40.190> a

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
to the RPMs are just too much so with a

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.430 
to the RPMs are just too much so with a
double<00:01:40.549> stack<00:01:40.729> unit<00:01:41.090> split<00:01:41.690> that<00:01:41.869> fan<00:01:42.110> speed

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
double stack unit split that fan speed

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.029 
double stack unit split that fan speed
so<00:01:42.830> everything<00:01:43.100> stays<00:01:44.110> nice<00:01:45.110> and<00:01:45.140> dependable

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
so everything stays nice and dependable

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:53.410 
so everything stays nice and dependable
all<00:01:46.850> right<00:01:46.970> so<00:01:47.119> I'll<00:01:47.210> take<00:01:47.360> you<00:01:47.479> inside<00:01:52.420> now

most mostly dealt with the top floor in
an<00:02:00.380> office<00:02:01.340> room<00:02:02.140> but<00:02:03.580> so<00:02:04.580> this<00:02:04.700> was<00:02:04.850> mainly

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
an office room but so this was mainly

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.249 
an office room but so this was mainly
for<00:02:05.299> cooling<00:02:05.600> and<00:02:05.780> then<00:02:05.899> we're<00:02:06.049> going<00:02:06.140> to<00:02:06.200> use

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
for cooling and then we're going to use

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:16.660 
for cooling and then we're going to use
the<00:02:06.440> ductless<00:02:06.770> on<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.009> shoulders<00:02:15.489> come<00:02:16.489> in

the ductless on the shoulders come in

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.309 
the ductless on the shoulders come in
here<00:02:17.290> so<00:02:18.290> this<00:02:18.380> is<00:02:18.500> office<00:02:18.830> space<00:02:20.140> there's<00:02:21.140> our

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
here so this is office space there's our

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.380 
here so this is office space there's our
head<00:02:21.560> there<00:02:21.769> that<00:02:21.980> was<00:02:22.190> all<00:02:22.430> Attic<00:02:22.940> back<00:02:23.150> there

is<00:04:19.830> a<00:04:19.860> little<00:04:20.040> more<00:04:20.130> expensive<00:04:20.310> but<00:04:20.580> works

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
is a little more expensive but works

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.690 
is a little more expensive but works
awesome<00:04:21.360> in<00:04:21.900> this<00:04:22.020> case<00:04:22.230> you<00:04:23.220> know<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.430> idea

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
awesome in this case you know the idea

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.660 
awesome in this case you know the idea
was<00:04:24.740> our<00:04:25.740> competitors<00:04:26.160> were<00:04:26.280> thinking<00:04:26.580> an

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
was our competitors were thinking an

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.620 
was our competitors were thinking an
outside<00:04:27.030> wall<00:04:27.240> it<00:04:27.810> goes<00:04:27.840> that<00:04:28.170> one<00:04:29.360> this<00:04:30.360> wall

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
outside wall it goes that one this wall

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.120 
outside wall it goes that one this wall
from<00:04:30.840> an<00:04:30.960> inside<00:04:31.320> standpoint<00:04:31.860> would<00:04:32.010> have

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
from an inside standpoint would have

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.760 
from an inside standpoint would have
worked<00:04:32.300> but<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:33.450> problem<00:04:33.870> is<00:04:34.020> is<00:04:34.260> that<00:04:34.290> I've

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770

this bathroom skylight Exedra so I

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.370 
this bathroom skylight Exedra so I
really<00:04:45.300> wanted<00:04:45.480> to<00:04:45.540> hit<00:04:45.630> both<00:04:45.810> those<00:04:46.080> spaces

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
really wanted to hit both those spaces

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.830 
really wanted to hit both those spaces
plus<00:04:47.370> by<00:04:48.150> doing<00:04:48.390> everything<00:04:48.570> through<00:04:48.780> the
