00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
of advice I get the most is probably

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.020 
of advice I get the most is probably
will<00:02:48.739> just<00:02:49.099> think<00:02:49.220> about<00:02:49.370> your<00:02:49.610> grandmother

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
will just think about your grandmother

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.630 
will just think about your grandmother
and<00:02:50.360> that<00:02:50.900> should<00:02:51.200> work<00:02:51.440> that<00:02:52.220> sounds<00:02:52.519> like<00:02:52.550> a

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
and that should work that sounds like a

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.390 
and that should work that sounds like a
great<00:02:52.850> idea<00:02:53.000> but<00:02:53.959> I<00:02:54.290> don't<00:02:54.890> want<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.100> try<00:02:55.340> it

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
great idea but I don't want to try it

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.400 
great idea but I don't want to try it
because<00:02:55.670> if<00:02:56.120> it<00:02:56.330> doesn't<00:02:56.780> work<00:02:56.930> then<00:02:57.170> I'm

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
because if it doesn't work then I'm

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.449 
because if it doesn't work then I'm
sitting<00:02:57.650> here<00:02:57.680> thinking<00:02:57.950> about<00:02:58.340> my

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
sitting here thinking about my

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.900 
sitting here thinking about my
grandmother<00:02:58.760> fucking<00:02:59.390> boner<00:03:00.459> and<00:03:01.459> that's
