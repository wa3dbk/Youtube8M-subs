00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 suv combine off-road vehicles with 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.390
 limousines who is too long for that 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.059
 the manufacturers like to serve one too 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.420
 pinch motorsport to car image had 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.269
 the mercedes gn a 45 amg and the audi 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.100
 rs3 the recipes of amg and quattro gmbh 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.859
 compared on the round course 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.000
 in the fight for ever new customers have the 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.560
 manufacturer discovered something which is 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.480
 crossover calls the crossing of 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.890
 different vehicle classes that you 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.840
 almost no limits know 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.760
 show these two cars because that is 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.529
 actually suvs so higher 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.820
 SUVs but have the same 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.809
 lowered again a bit 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.880
 to make sportier 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.790
 the newest of its kind is the gla 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.670
 45 amg with 360 hp and all-wheel drive 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.739
 he acts against the well-known audi rs3 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.289
 the one with a really cool five-cylinder 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.969
 and 310 ps who starts from the two 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.410
 faster on the race track 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.410
 Wonder your contidrom times 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.190
 the two-liter four-cylinder in gl a45 amg 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.350
 currently has the strongest liter performance 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.809
 a production car with this poisonous 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.820
 aggregate sprints the amg in 5 2 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.620
 seconds from zero to one hundred so much 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.960
 power has of course its price and the 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.600
 is paid at the gas station to 100 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:18.280
 miles the amg swallows 9.6 liters 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.830
 great the audi is still a bit thirsty 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.320
 he needs 10 1 on our test round 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.570
 he also speaks liter in smooth 5 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.890
 seconds on tempo 100 and his 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.470
 by the way, the same thing 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.470
 five cylinder is installed in tt rs 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.750
 even if it is on this q3 rs 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.759
 what actually for the sportiest 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.500
 audi is not really right 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.910
 become an athlete then on the 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.740
 street he really makes gaudi 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.759
 Such problems five-cylinder engine with 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.270
 the soft-switching 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.830
 dual-clutch transmission of the race track 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.990
 however, is only a good rider but 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.720
 quite overwhelmed the bank very strong 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.710
 the understeers noticeably more and you understeer 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.200
 Feels a bit like you do 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.970
 Elephants do not ride the whole thing either 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.960
 really unsympathetic but on the 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.119
 race track has lost nothing 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.429
 the swing chassis is the q3 rs 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.560
 punish as in a ordinary q3 though 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.870
 still softer than that of the little one 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.519
 Bands which makes comfortable damping 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.930
 stretch well on long but 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.090
 bad on the race track 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.830
 this drawback costs the audi right 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.630
 time at high speeds on the 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.610
 The motor of the q3 and 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.070
 vibrates strongly the highly dynamic 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.690
 discipline dominated the gla 45 amg 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:33.280
 all better than the audi 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.140
 the opponent is not just an optical one 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.150
 rather atypical mercedes but he 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.500
 is also mercedes when driving 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.060
 really a real sport here 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.060
 put grenade on the wheels that is 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.540
 a really wild dog that is loud 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.890
 is uncomfortable that is uncouth the 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.349
 squeezes in english sport 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.209
 expect that sounds negative now 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.130
 lingering is actually as is 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.330
 whole package makes the thing really fun 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.550
 and is coherent one 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.690
 nice car and so fast 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.700
 even with all sportiness has 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.769
 mercedes the everyday comfort somehow 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.019
 completely ignored the broad 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.880
 Ripe race in every track groove and that 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.840
 Tight chassis shakes the change 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.269
 out of the pants pocket 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.250
 the turbocharger is so big that he has something 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.510
 slow in gear comes when the pressure 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.860
 but then there it stumbles 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.380
 dual-clutch transmission of the power 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.540
 afterwards only in sports mode will the 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.200
 Go fast hard and above all fit 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.370
 served to the audi rs3 then you notice 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.019
 but a little bit of that 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.790
 actually a modified vw tiguan 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.500
 is because he feels on the track 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.690
 not really well the wall very much 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.250
 strong one sits very high is a force 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.109
 However, the five-cylinder engine of 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.239
 Sounds really good, it works really well 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.250
 which makes Gaudi properly even if a 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.049
 pretty nasty consumer like that 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.850
 mercedes is doing much better 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.350
 already optically much lower than that 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.390
 audi, he also feels on the 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.040
 race track probably goes around the curves 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.620
 really almost like a compact athlete 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.150
 the 360 ​​hp four-cylinder sounds at least 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.489
 with the performance exhaust system 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.840
 incredibly good and he is almost four 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.970
 seconds faster on the race track 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.920
 that is a whole world and even if he is 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.650
 really expensive is under the line in 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.930
 this class the better buy externally 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.060
 and driving dynamics the differences 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.190
 between k 45 amg and s 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.380
 they are three huge on paper 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.810
 almost marginal from the body truck 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:22.389
 stand with both vehicles 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.389
 minimum price for the base around 55,000
