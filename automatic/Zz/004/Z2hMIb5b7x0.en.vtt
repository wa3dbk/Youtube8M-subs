hmm<00:02:01.450> I<00:02:01.570> mean<00:02:02.080> some<00:02:02.289> people<00:02:02.409> are<00:02:02.649> really

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
hmm I mean some people are really

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.370 
hmm I mean some people are really
germaphobic<00:02:03.520> when<00:02:03.640> it<00:02:03.759> comes<00:02:03.940> to<00:02:04.119> that<00:02:04.299> but<00:02:05.140> I

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
germaphobic when it comes to that but I

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.999 
germaphobic when it comes to that but I
really<00:02:05.920> really<00:02:06.310> think<00:02:06.670> that<00:02:06.970> you<00:02:07.299> guys<00:02:08.009> can

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
really really think that you guys can

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.009 
really really think that you guys can
get<00:02:09.459> away<00:02:09.670> with<00:02:09.910> using<00:02:10.179> them<00:02:10.479> a<00:02:10.509> couple<00:02:10.899> of

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
get away with using them a couple of

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.930 
get away with using them a couple of
times<00:02:11.080> maximum<00:02:12.040> I<00:02:12.870> would<00:02:13.870> say<00:02:14.610> five<00:02:15.610> times

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
times maximum I would say five times

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.910 
times maximum I would say five times
maximum<00:02:16.480> depends<00:02:17.200> on<00:02:17.290> how<00:02:17.440> good<00:02:17.620> you<00:02:17.739> take

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
maximum depends on how good you take

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.650 
maximum depends on how good you take
care<00:02:18.130> of<00:02:18.160> it<00:02:18.370> or<00:02:18.519> like<00:02:18.819> if<00:02:19.030> you<00:02:19.180> have<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.480> lot<00:02:19.630> of

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
care of it or like if you have a lot of

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.020 
care of it or like if you have a lot of
glue<00:02:20.019> and<00:02:20.470> then<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:20.739> the<00:02:20.920> band<00:02:21.370> starts<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:21.880> rip

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
glue and then it the band starts to rip

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.400 
glue and then it the band starts to rip
you<00:02:22.209> can<00:02:22.360> actually<00:02:22.569> cut<00:02:23.080> them<00:02:23.260> in<00:02:23.380> little

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
you can actually cut them in little

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.130 
you can actually cut them in little
pieces<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:24.250> use<00:02:24.880> them<00:02:25.120> for<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.480> bottoms<00:02:25.870> so
