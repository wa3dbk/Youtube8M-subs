00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
the mixing key software and I've hit

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.359 
the mixing key software and I've hit
analyze<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.289> it's<00:00:25.410> given<00:00:25.650> me<00:00:25.769> this<00:00:25.949> result

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
on the mixing key website and it allows

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.010 
on the mixing key website and it allows
you<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.880> mix<00:00:36.059> tunes<00:00:36.360> together<00:00:36.600> without

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
you to mix tunes together without

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.810 
you to mix tunes together without
knowing<00:00:37.410> anything<00:00:37.620> about<00:00:37.829> musical<00:00:38.399> theory

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
and more often than not hit a really

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.229 
and more often than not hit a really
good<00:00:41.040> key<00:00:41.340> mix<00:00:41.579> which<00:00:41.730> means<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.090> everything

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
good key mix which means that everything

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.910 
good key mix which means that everything
stays<00:00:42.540> tuned<00:00:42.840> full<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.290> sounds<00:00:43.649> excellent

want to show you is some of the things
in<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:49.530> software<00:00:49.890> which<00:00:50.460> if<00:00:50.670> you've<00:00:50.850> mixed

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
in this software which if you've mixed

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.060 
in this software which if you've mixed
in<00:00:51.719> key<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.079> old<00:00:52.230> way<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.469> if<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.770> have<00:00:52.920> got

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
software is doing something that's going

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.760

to save you a lot of time so here we
have<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.250> keys<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:03.329> also<00:01:03.480> gives<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
have the keys it also gives you the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.570 
have the keys it also gives you the
energy<00:01:04.229> level<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.920> song<00:01:05.129> which<00:01:05.430> is

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
energy level of the song which is

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.920 
energy level of the song which is
something<00:01:05.790> new<00:01:06.090> it's<00:01:06.270> kind<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.570> like<00:01:06.720> got<00:01:06.810> an

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
something new it's kind of like got an

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.530 
something new it's kind of like got an
algorithm<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.799> picks<00:01:08.250> up<00:01:08.549> on<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
algorithm in it that picks up on the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.300 
algorithm in it that picks up on the
hi-hat<00:01:09.750> patterns<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.619> generally<00:01:10.950> how<00:01:11.100> much

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
hi-hat patterns and generally how much

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.030 
hi-hat patterns and generally how much
how<00:01:12.000> much<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.720> pumps<00:01:13.110> along<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.770> give<00:01:13.920> you

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
how much it pumps along to give you

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.130 
how much it pumps along to give you
again<00:01:14.670> something<00:01:14.939> else<00:01:15.119> another<00:01:15.420> tool<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.960> mix

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
again something else another tool to mix

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.719 
again something else another tool to mix
by<00:01:16.350> these<00:01:16.590> aren't<00:01:16.770> rules<00:01:17.070> you're<00:01:17.369> not<00:01:17.490> meant

by these aren't rules you're not meant

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.120 
by these aren't rules you're not meant
to<00:01:17.790> only<00:01:18.030> mixing<00:01:18.509> key<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.810> only<00:01:18.900> mix<00:01:19.200> songs

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
chorus the one that underpins it the one

chorus the one that underpins it the one
the<00:02:57.810> bass<00:02:57.989> often<00:02:58.349> plays<00:02:58.590> is<00:02:58.860> generally<00:02:59.519> the

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
the bass often plays is generally the

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.520 
the bass often plays is generally the
starting<00:03:00.599> though<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:00.870> your<00:03:01.019> key<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.349> then<00:03:01.440> you

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
starting though of your key and then you

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.780 
starting though of your key and then you
only<00:03:01.620> have<00:03:01.739> to<00:03:01.890> work<00:03:02.069> out<00:03:02.250> whether<00:03:02.430> it's<00:03:02.670> in

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
only have to work out whether it's in

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.460 
only have to work out whether it's in
major<00:03:03.030> or<00:03:03.330> minor<00:03:03.630> which<00:03:04.019> is<00:03:04.049> there's<00:03:04.319> two

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
major or minor which is there's two

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.460 
major or minor which is there's two
variations<00:03:04.799> of<00:03:05.190> scales<00:03:06.120> used<00:03:06.480> in<00:03:06.630> keys<00:03:06.870> so

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
variations of scales used in keys so

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.970 
variations of scales used in keys so
let's<00:03:07.769> play<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.700> whole<00:03:08.880> chord

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.520 

so<00:03:13.580> that<00:03:13.760> does<00:03:14.209> sound<00:03:14.540> really<00:03:14.840> good<00:03:15.080> if<00:03:15.260> I<00:03:15.379> was

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
so that does sound really good if I was

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.330 
so that does sound really good if I was
to<00:03:15.650> play<00:03:15.739> Major<00:03:16.069> by<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.310> way<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:21.560> notes<00:03:22.099> that

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
to play Major by the way the notes that

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:29.559 
to play Major by the way the notes that
make<00:03:22.489> up<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:22.819> dominant<00:03:23.420> chord<00:03:23.870> are

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.289 

that<00:03:30.170> is<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.409> minor<00:03:30.620> chord<00:03:30.950> based<00:03:31.939> around<00:03:32.180> the

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
that is the minor chord based around the

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.360 
that is the minor chord based around the
root<00:03:32.510> note<00:03:32.749> of<00:03:33.170> B<00:03:33.620> which<00:03:33.920> is<00:03:34.069> this<00:03:34.159> one<00:03:34.340> here

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
root note of B which is this one here

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.559 
root note of B which is this one here
you<00:03:34.549> don't<00:03:34.700> have<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:34.879> know<00:03:35.060> that<00:03:35.239> by<00:03:35.359> the<00:03:35.389> way

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
you don't have to know that by the way
