teaching<00:03:24.040> them<00:03:24.400> to<00:03:24.430> do<00:03:24.730> is<00:03:24.940> it's<00:03:25.630> mainly<00:03:25.959> the

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
teaching them to do is it's mainly the

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.520 
teaching them to do is it's mainly the
research<00:03:26.890> and<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.930> combining<00:03:28.930> of<00:03:29.110> all<00:03:29.350> the

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530

research and the combining of all the
ideas<00:03:29.950> into<00:03:30.280> one<00:03:30.310> place<00:03:30.670> so<00:03:31.740> we<00:03:32.740> lay<00:03:33.040> out<00:03:33.220> the

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
ideas into one place so we lay out the

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.880 
ideas into one place so we lay out the
many<00:03:33.550> books<00:03:33.790> in<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.570> folders<00:03:35.050> or<00:03:35.080> notebooks

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
many books in the folders or notebooks

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.890

depending<00:03:36.430> on<00:03:36.550> which<00:03:36.790> design<00:03:37.270> we<00:03:37.480> decide<00:03:37.750> to

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
depending on which design we decide to

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.090 
depending on which design we decide to
do<00:03:38.459> and<00:03:39.459> then<00:03:39.730> we<00:03:39.910> start<00:03:40.209> decorating<00:03:40.860> we<00:03:41.860> can

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
do and then we start decorating we can

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.240 
do and then we start decorating we can
add<00:03:42.810> pictures<00:03:43.950> sticker
