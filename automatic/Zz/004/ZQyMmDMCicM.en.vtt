00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.199
 Today I have a whole time 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.789

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.710
 I wrote a lot to facebook 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:59.049

 Prototype is on youtube ps freaks out 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.670
 That's because funny videos matter 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.350
 because he's a nice game player 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.960
 can play from the basic call of all 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.000
 Duty brings and easy his 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.770
 Disability I celebrate I celebrate his 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.210
 Disability and I think sometimes me 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.579
 I'm just as disabled as he is 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.850
 So I bring as well as fuck 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:38.469
 Disability is like him and I have mine 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.130
 never ordered like t shirts yet 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:44.259

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:50.979

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.020
 age he fits like a glove here 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.990
 my goodness people really cool people me 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.220
 I was so happy I had thought 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.530
 he does not come anymore 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.729
 I ordered it two weeks ago 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.619
 and I 'm sick of that 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.489
 thought made old because why stay in 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.050
 the sweater 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:15.989
 I was so right there and I have 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.650
 not just not thought and everyone 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.870
 posted on facebook 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.760
 I have the project t shirt I have it 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.500
 t shirt I have it exactly 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.180
 actually ordered after release so 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.040
 I had to be very fast 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.920
 but no 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.370
 johnny caspar was lucky again 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.590
 Good luck for misfortune, I say so 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.600
 I have a really fresh meal for that 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.230
 sweaters get people looking for them 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.819
 hot 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.269
 and there was even a tiny little one 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.709
 Surprise even more 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.540
 gummi bear track at the start like me 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.880
 unfortunately not eaten then 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.630
 because I think if the package is two 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.250
 weeks is in circulation and two weeks the 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.549
 gummy bears already in this carton 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:03.989
 I think I'm lying, I am indeed 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:05.850
 hinders but so very disabled so well 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.140
 one can actually still I eat 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.700
 guess the gummy bears are not 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.540
 Bad I'll try it 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.730
 but I have people just a role model 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.340
 because he is high quality 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.340
 makes videos and on the ground I think 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.500
 simply he took a long time to get it 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.510
 he has got very big now 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.560
 his 100 thousand subscribers cracked 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.350
 People have to do that first 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.200
 imagine 100,000 subscribe to you 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.030
 daily watch comments 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.850
 Write and I just think I want 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.650
 just like that community wants to build up and 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.630
 I just do not get up and I will 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.850
 make it so I have the goal 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.739
 and the stamina I have 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.620
 easy and I think the potential 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.299
 I also because you always have something like that 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.030
 cool in the comments write here 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:54.209
 best youtuber and stuff and that already 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.950
 with 600 subscribers, I find something like that 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.910
 from Krass and I have a little 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.500
 model and 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.940
 I just watch his videos I watch 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.630
 just his videos now i have to be 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.370
 t shirt his sweater indulged 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.410
 I think it's really cool so people you 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.960
 you can definitely this 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.850
 Sweaters can link below in the video 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:17.660
 description is actually total 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:19.790
 processed so cool I have nothing 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.930
 to complain really cool also this logo 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.640
 I thought that was a bit 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.530
 gray or you can tell 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.780
 but you hardly notice it is not 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.520
 very very smooth so I think so 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.540
 horny age com my breasts so right 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.370
 to the fore 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.120
 Let's see what the girls on the street 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:37.040
 so also say pullover 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:40.880
 Of course, dear Martin has something 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:43.700
 said that so there was such a girl 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.320
 and so I found the action really cool 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.890
 So you can definitely the 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.380
 sweater I do not mind there 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.240
 so to speak, that it counted correctly 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.360
 has been 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:05:00.230
 ps say freaks and yes I wanted 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:03.410
 Simply say that you wanted firstly 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.750
 know what is your role model and 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.120
 of course you need a role model because of me 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.370
 think an example gives you easy 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.050
 So the motivation he grabs is so he 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.880
 has the success and you want it 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.060
 of course, and it is only possible 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.320
 if you want yourself and if you yourself 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.230
 think about you 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.150
 or believe and i believe in myself 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.800
 I'm fully motivated on youtube and me 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.020
 will definitely pack it together 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.840
 with your help along with your cash register 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.870
 support and people that 's it 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.760
 actually treat yourself to this 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.440
 make sweaters so people do it right 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.190
 chilled and the gameplay in the background 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:42.830
 is also chill and right way by the way 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:47.240
