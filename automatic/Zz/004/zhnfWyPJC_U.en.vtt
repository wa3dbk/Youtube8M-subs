00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.750

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.970
 I can put it on my own so I 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.619

 already at the time of putting this here is the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.320
 duvet is white and I put the cover 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.840

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.580

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.119

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.740

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.680
