00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.099 
here on the left let's go ahead and take
this<00:00:59.160> out<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.820> do<00:01:00.030> have<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.329> slide<00:01:00.570> them<00:01:00.660> over<00:01:00.809> to

this out I do have to slide them over to
get<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.379> one<00:01:01.620> out<00:01:01.739> just<00:01:02.100> because<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.640> is

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
get this one out just because this is

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.450 
get this one out just because this is
items<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.570> don't<00:01:03.809> use<00:01:03.989> quite<00:01:04.260> as<00:01:04.409> often<00:01:04.589> so

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
items that I don't use quite as often so

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.550 
items that I don't use quite as often so
I<00:01:05.489> didn't<00:01:05.939> need<00:01:06.030> as<00:01:06.210> easy<00:01:06.479> access<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.409> as

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
I didn't need as easy access to it as

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.500 
I didn't need as easy access to it as
the<00:01:07.770> others<00:01:08.070> as<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.850> didn't<00:01:09.030> see<00:01:09.150> there's<00:01:09.360> not

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
the others as you didn't see there's not

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.080 
the others as you didn't see there's not
too<00:01:09.750> much<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.320> bin<00:01:10.650> um<00:01:10.920> this<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
too much in this bin um this is just the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.910 
too much in this bin um this is just the
Box<00:01:12.390> she<00:01:12.630> came<00:01:12.840> home<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.470> think<00:01:13.680> it'd<00:01:13.770> be

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
Box she came home in I think it'd be

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.710 
Box she came home in I think it'd be
good<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.340> keep<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.760> in<00:01:14.970> case<00:01:15.180> she<00:01:15.360> ever<00:01:15.390> needs

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
good to keep this in case she ever needs

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.109 
good to keep this in case she ever needs
to<00:01:16.049> go<00:01:16.740> anywhere<00:01:17.130> or<00:01:17.189> if<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.610> just<00:01:17.759> need<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.970> put

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
instead of Katie next time but I thought

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.760 
instead of Katie next time but I thought
it<00:02:34.630> would<00:02:34.690> just<00:02:34.870> give<00:02:35.020> her<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.260> little<00:02:35.320> variety

in<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.959> past<00:03:20.110> Buttercup<00:03:20.800> does<00:03:21.010> have<00:03:21.220> a

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
in the past Buttercup does have a

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.090 
in the past Buttercup does have a
sectioned<00:03:21.850> off<00:03:21.970> treat<00:03:22.480> dish<00:03:22.720> but<00:03:23.440> for<00:03:23.650> now<00:03:23.770> all

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
sectioned off treat dish but for now all

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.820 
sectioned off treat dish but for now all
the<00:03:24.220> pumpkins<00:03:24.700> are<00:03:24.790> just<00:03:25.060> mixed<00:03:25.450> in<00:03:25.600> here<00:03:26.020> so

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
the pumpkins are just mixed in here so

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.590 
the pumpkins are just mixed in here so
this<00:03:27.010> thing<00:03:27.280> it<00:03:27.550> is<00:03:27.700> a<00:03:27.730> pretty<00:03:28.030> big<00:03:28.090> container

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
this thing it is a pretty big container

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.150 
this thing it is a pretty big container
so<00:03:28.870> these<00:03:28.989> treats<00:03:29.320> will<00:03:29.500> last<00:03:29.709> her<00:03:29.890> forever

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
so these treats will last her forever

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.310 
so these treats will last her forever
and<00:03:31.060> a<00:03:31.239> lot<00:03:31.420> of<00:03:31.450> them<00:03:31.690> will<00:03:31.780> probably<00:03:31.810> end<00:03:32.200> up

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
and a lot of them will probably end up

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.840 
and a lot of them will probably end up
