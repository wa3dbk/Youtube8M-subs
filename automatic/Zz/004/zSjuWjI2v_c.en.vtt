00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 favors so but otherwise 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.069
 was not much there 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.700
 and thus the highlights are sixth 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.280
 minute, for example, then only in one 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.960
 direction a capital shot sixth 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.710
 minute of it 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:24.109
 gambari the bullet from feist to 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:27.119
 first time so here latener hits and 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:29.820
 then another post hit should be yes 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.820
 barbie will follow again very soon 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.579
 Aggressive they see that we 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.230
 are well played out in the 18 minutes 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.879
 has perhaps a bit too 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.899
 It takes a long time for the ball to pick up 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.820
 puts her stronger left and thereby 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:50.750
 then it just fails too 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.750
 released by dzsenifer marozsan 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.730
 German team determined that 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.559
 happened in the game moved forward 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.180
 just fine against the ball this little 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.000
 behind and then just before 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.030
 halftime whistle as leonie maier after 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.939
 in the foreground , at noon, started well 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.400
 here and noon then technically the whole 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.060
 made excellent and then look 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.080
 and then there was actually the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.890
 norwegian goalkeeper ingrid hjelmseth 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:28.920
 still on it and could there the deserved 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:36.320
 German goalkeeper still in the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:36.320
 last moment later 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.229
 henning 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:03.920
 and that's something of deserved over 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.119
 noon this action the 1 0 for the 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.120
 German team 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:13.099
 and she has to meet okoyino there 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.050
 mbabi who had an incredible start 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.420
 Nice interaction markus damage 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.250
 noon because they were not paying attention and 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.280
 that looks good too 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.650
 the deserved leadership and currently so 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.549
 the german team clear 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.739
 final price 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:30.319
 and that would be what we do 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.000
 so far have also been absolutely 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.900
 deserves that would be another highlight 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.500
 then probably against the usa 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.239
 world ranking first Olympic champion and 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.530
 but there is still a bit of time left 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:48.920
 In any case is now one 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:51.080
 completely different game here also one 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.750
 talented young player this svenja 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.549
 huth turned 22 in january 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.109
 As you approached German team 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.109
 in the bus a few experienced if it 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.209
 wonderful 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.970
 great combination and kessler meets 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.720
 again 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:20.480
 and that should have happened and that 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.340
 is also worth the height in this height 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.370
 German team now the 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.599
 last 15 minutes not so 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.780
 constructively played with two very 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:32.690
 Nice attacks next to what hat is now 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.610
 it gÃ¶ÃŸling and kessler calls the whole 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.930
 time the game plays but then set 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.310
 from time to time meets the ball very briefly 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.290
 beautiful preparation one of the 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:47.209
 positive appearances in this game 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:50.690
 certainly lena goessling her role 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.120
 there on the goalie position completely 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:56.660
 Perfectly filled after two goals 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:00.280
 Kessler now speaks against France 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.299
 also a hit here at the algarve cup 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.340
 So under the stroke was that one 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.670
 clean performance there she was very 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.150
 handsome football here at the algarve 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.709
 cup and thus defending champion 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.160
 Germany then actually with the 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:20.720
 last game at this tournament 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:21.799
 The day after tomorrow will be played second 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.919
 are still I think not so 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.010
 exactly fixed there is a list before there 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:32.050
 on it to be confirmed so the final 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.050
 then Germany against question mark 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.660
 germany usa is of course one 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.660
 beautiful jar then 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:49.310
 and the game is off on time 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:51.950
 the second had almost no problems 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.240
 Argentine referee little 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.850
 The German team had problems 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.390
 with this robust norwegian team yes 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:05.530
 Well started by the co-trainer 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:08.690
 norway as a group second and 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:11.120
 deserved applause and on fair 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.830
 Congratulations from just pelle , he advises 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:18.590
 certainly again objectively classified 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:19.790
 becomes as you know him and then too 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.400
 will acknowledge that the German 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:25.670
 team was better and took barbie 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.010
 kessler the scorers angler and that 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:32.170
 it always went well without a go against it 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:34.790
 gave 3 1 against Japan 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:37.730
 the japanese women are so today 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:40.100
 little bit on the reparation course 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.750
 were best players in norway 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.300
 certainly the goalkeeper ingrid 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.850
 hjelmseth in Germany again one 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.520
 very closed team performance 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:53.000
 Cheap is highly noticed as 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.820
 mbabi has made a lot of work in 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.380
 the first half 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.600
 yes, but really a highlight 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.790
 I think you do not necessarily have to 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.950
 Also today were some failures again 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.990
 and I think that is 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.270
 the most important message above all 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:12.850
 things happen who cool by the way in 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.850
 the middle takes the silver with it
