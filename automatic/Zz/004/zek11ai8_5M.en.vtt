00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:09.230
 Hi everyone who is watching ghs tv I like the arrangement today 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:15.589
 Sweets half-up arrangement I introduced before 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:18.980
 It is easier because some people felt it was a knitting arrangement for beginners or difficult 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:20.340
 I will answer the request to know the arrangement 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:26.369
 Braid on the side 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:31.170
 It is an easy arrangement to stop the grip mischief by putting two in layers when making 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:37.670
 Because it is arrange style that can be widely done from medium style to long style 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.670
 Please try the challenge and see the video 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.790
 First of all, it is a system of defending him 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.400
 I lowered it a bit because I think so again 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.370
 We in this way 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.370
 I would like to make my head into a braid 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.310
 pe 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.570
 There is no hair like this 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.009
 Make a braid 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.420
 a little 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.880
 It is more than a feeling of 2 next to filling 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.780
 Hey a 3 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.670

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.970
 A little like this 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:57.390
 Let's relax 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.310
 I would like to temporarily stop this more than completed 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.880
 Clip etc day 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.000

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.790

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.900
 Something like this 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:02.000
 We'll have a little experienced this at one time 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.000
 If you can get to here 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:13.160
 If you're worried that it's broken down a lot, it's okay to get the hair ends in six 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:17.260
 I can afford a little 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:21.870
