00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.019
 m 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.470
 we will welcome now 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.880
 charlotte king she will present us her 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.420
 subject and makes stimulation 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:40.129
 multimodal rhythmic on locomotion 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:43.970
 we can encourage her cousin you give 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.710
 soul and explodes you will grant me that 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.930
 this approach is daring if this 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.640
 is outright insulting and yet 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.150
 ladies and gentlemen this match where you 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.960
 wants good 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.670
 he thinks of your future I explain myself 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.989
 the goal of my thesis and to re-educate 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.120
 the margin of the elderly and 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.330
 Parkinson's patients from our 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.059
 tango knowledge imagine you 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.860
 dance a tango to dance to two he 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.049
 must exchange of communication 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.540
 but how to communicate are spoken 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:14.690
 through other meanings and 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.460
 their interaction in the tango a 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.560
 part of the communication goes through the 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.200
 touch we follow where we guy our 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.600
 partners both with our hands and 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.490
 thanks to the movements of our bodies to 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.370
 this tactile communication is added on 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.650
 her music guides our steps it's she 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.930
 which gives us the rhythm and rhythm it 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.450
 is fundamental because it allows our 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.010
 hands and our ears to say pretty much 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.040
 at the same time different things to 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.600
 our brain so these are these aspects 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.490
 sensory and rhythmic that leads to 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.590
 body in motion because two people 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.930
 who dance are two people who 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.330
 move a I love you me either 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.360
 revealed by these bodies that changes from 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.380
 speed or even direction these 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.530
 movements we have them every day 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:01.160
 as we walk to seduce we must 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.020
 step forward to avoid the slap knowing 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.700
 retreat 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.240
 you will have understood it between dance and 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.360
 walking 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.840
 there is only one step according to recent 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.819
 studies 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.200
 Tango can improve walking 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.870
 in the elderly and patients 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.580
 Parkinson's the tango if we summarize it 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.580
 these are tactile sensations and 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.170
 auditory and rhythm from 10 of 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.550
 these two aspects and studies of the 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.620
 neurophysiology of perception 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.200
 we then imagined a device 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.790
 simple laptop with bracelets 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.090
 vibrating and earphones with 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.470
 metronomes actually 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.989
 it's about enjoying the benefits of 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.239
 the dance without having advanced and there you 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.870
 you say great I can stay leaning 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.400
 at the bar do not hesitate to you I address myself 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.890
 no the idea is to propose a 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.330
 daily training of 30 minutes 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.459
 during which the elderly 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.030
 patients will walk to the rhythm of his 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.019
 metronome and vibrations 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.870
 this training should improve 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.810
 their walk and think about that 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.360
 means walking walking is being 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.260
 autonomous is to be free 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.299
 concretely that means going to the 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.299
 bakery or see friends these moments 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.769
 where we share we discuss 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.989
 finally a term the goal of my 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.910
 thesis is to improve the quality of life 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.079
 of these people 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.030
 as for you ladies and gentlemen 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.950
 let yourself be tempted by the next 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.549
 dance and if it's a question of 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.760
 motivation 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:24.459
 think about the definition of desproges the 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.989
 dance is a vertical frustration of a 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.989
 horizontal desire
