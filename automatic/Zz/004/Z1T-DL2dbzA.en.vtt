keyboards are more than worth their
money<00:05:11.800> the<00:05:12.069> build<00:05:12.340> quality<00:05:12.520> this<00:05:13.210> I'd<00:05:13.509> have<00:05:13.569> to

00:05:13.769 --> 00:05:13.779 
money the build quality this I'd have to

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:14.879 
money the build quality this I'd have to
get<00:05:13.900> a<00:05:13.930> torch<00:05:14.169> here<00:05:14.379> to<00:05:14.500> show<00:05:14.650> you<00:05:14.710> where<00:05:14.830> this

very dark so as you can see you can see

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:25.499 
very dark so as you can see you can see
the<00:05:22.659> brushstrokes<00:05:22.990> of<00:05:23.710> aluminium<00:05:24.270> it<00:05:25.270> is<00:05:25.419> an

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:25.509 
the brushstrokes of aluminium it is an

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:28.589 
the brushstrokes of aluminium it is an
amazing<00:05:26.379> built<00:05:27.219> keyboard<00:05:27.669> you<00:05:28.330> can<00:05:28.479> actually

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:28.599 
amazing built keyboard you can actually

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:31.200 
amazing built keyboard you can actually
put<00:05:29.529> full<00:05:29.830> talk<00:05:30.069> on<00:05:30.279> it<00:05:30.400> and<00:05:30.550> you<00:05:30.699> won't<00:05:30.909> get<00:05:31.089> it

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
put full talk on it and you won't get it

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.899 
put full talk on it and you won't get it
to<00:05:31.330> bend<00:05:31.479> it<00:05:31.900> is<00:05:32.740> just<00:05:32.949> very<00:05:33.009> very<00:05:33.639> nice

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:33.909 
to bend it is just very very nice

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:35.519 
to bend it is just very very nice
quality<00:05:34.330> okay<00:05:34.810> so<00:05:34.870> it's<00:05:35.020> very<00:05:35.080> hard<00:05:35.259> to<00:05:35.379> get<00:05:35.469> a

00:05:35.519 --> 00:05:35.529 
quality okay so it's very hard to get a

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:37.079 
quality okay so it's very hard to get a
good<00:05:35.650> angle<00:05:35.770> of<00:05:36.009> this<00:05:36.159> and<00:05:36.400> by<00:05:36.669> the<00:05:36.729> way<00:05:36.909> the

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:37.089 
good angle of this and by the way the

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:38.820 
good angle of this and by the way the
backlight<00:05:37.479> flicker<00:05:37.870> that<00:05:38.050> shown<00:05:38.289> in<00:05:38.440> video<00:05:38.650> is

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
backlight flicker that shown in video is

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.219 
backlight flicker that shown in video is
not<00:05:39.009> actually<00:05:39.490> visible<00:05:40.360> in<00:05:40.569> real<00:05:40.839> life<00:05:40.960> it's

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
not actually visible in real life it's

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:43.110 
not actually visible in real life it's
just<00:05:41.500> because<00:05:41.800> of<00:05:41.830> the<00:05:42.339> capture<00:05:42.759> rate<00:05:42.909> and

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
just because of the capture rate and

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.600 
just because of the capture rate and

so<00:06:26.150> regimens<00:06:26.480> here<00:06:26.600> on<00:06:26.690> the<00:06:26.780> back<00:06:26.900> we<00:06:27.080> have<00:06:27.110> our

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320 
so regimens here on the back we have our

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.920 
so regimens here on the back we have our
little<00:06:27.530> USB<00:06:27.800> port<00:06:28.190> which<00:06:28.760> has<00:06:29.180> the<00:06:29.420> header<00:06:29.630> so

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
little USB port which has the header so

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.780 
little USB port which has the header so
you<00:06:30.020> can<00:06:30.140> go<00:06:30.230> up<00:06:30.260> full<00:06:30.590> USB<00:06:31.130> two<00:06:31.340> speeds<00:06:31.610> if

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:31.790 
you can go up full USB two speeds if

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.910 
you can go up full USB two speeds if
you're<00:06:31.910> using<00:06:32.060> something<00:06:32.420> like<00:06:32.600> a<00:06:33.230> flash

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:33.920 
you're using something like a flash

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.740 
you're using something like a flash
drive<00:06:34.070> or<00:06:34.340> something<00:06:34.520> like<00:06:34.730> that<00:06:34.790> and<00:06:35.150> we<00:06:35.630> have

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:35.750 
drive or something like that and we have

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:36.880 
drive or something like that and we have
our<00:06:35.930> little<00:06:36.080> switch<00:06:36.350> here<00:06:36.380> which<00:06:36.620> is<00:06:36.710> new<00:06:36.860> to

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:36.890 
our little switch here which is new to

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:41.220 
our little switch here which is new to
the<00:06:37.130> k70<00:06:37.700> you<00:06:38.180> can<00:06:38.300> go<00:06:38.450> one<00:06:38.720> two<00:06:39.410> four<00:06:40.100> and

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:41.230 
the k70 you can go one two four and

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:45.010 
the k70 you can go one two four and
think<00:06:42.230> eight<00:06:42.470> maybe<00:06:43.040> six<00:06:43.400> and<00:06:43.640> two<00:06:44.240> BIOS<00:06:44.630> so

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 
think eight maybe six and two BIOS so

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.720 
think eight maybe six and two BIOS so
this<00:06:45.200> is<00:06:45.320> for<00:06:45.560> operating<00:06:46.100> systems<00:06:46.430> that<00:06:46.520> don't

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:46.730 
this is for operating systems that don't

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.940 
this is for operating systems that don't
support<00:06:47.570> such<00:06:47.960> high<00:06:48.140> frequency<00:06:48.710> in<00:06:48.800> their

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:48.950 
support such high frequency in their

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.710 
support such high frequency in their
keyboards<00:06:49.370> you<00:06:49.610> can<00:06:49.730> go<00:06:49.790> to<00:06:49.850> BIOS<00:06:50.210> if<00:06:50.420> your

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 
keyboards you can go to BIOS if your

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.960 
keyboards you can go to BIOS if your
computer<00:06:51.620> doesn't<00:06:51.920> pick<00:06:52.430> up<00:06:52.580> your<00:06:52.700> keyboard

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:52.970 
computer doesn't pick up your keyboard

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.370 
computer doesn't pick up your keyboard
and<00:06:53.030> the<00:06:53.120> BIOS<00:06:53.360> which<00:06:53.510> happened<00:06:53.810> to<00:06:53.840> me<00:06:53.900> before

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:54.380 
and the BIOS which happened to me before

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.650 
and the BIOS which happened to me before
I<00:06:54.410> update<00:06:54.710> my<00:06:54.740> BIOS<00:06:55.100> and<00:06:55.970> you<00:06:56.180> can<00:06:56.330> go<00:06:56.450> all<00:06:56.510> the

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:56.660 
I update my BIOS and you can go all the

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.990 
I update my BIOS and you can go all the
way<00:06:56.690> to<00:06:56.780> one<00:06:57.080> which<00:06:57.500> is<00:06:57.770> its<00:06:58.070> default<00:06:58.550> setting

00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.000 
way to one which is its default setting

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.220 
way to one which is its default setting
so<00:06:59.210> there<00:06:59.570> you<00:06:59.630> are<00:06:59.750> there<00:06:59.900> was<00:06:59.990> my<00:07:00.080> unboxing

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:00.230 
so there you are there was my unboxing

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.080 
so there you are there was my unboxing
and<00:07:00.740> first<00:07:00.980> look<00:07:01.220> at<00:07:01.400> the<00:07:01.520> Corsair<00:07:01.940> Vengeance
