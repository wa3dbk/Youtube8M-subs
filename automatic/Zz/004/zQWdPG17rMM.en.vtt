 our favorite with you program steam 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.060
 match vitamin steam 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.580
 and Th screw manager 63 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.160
 that means that we need to 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.640
 to get things team fortress here 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.810
 here you will show your inventory 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.829
 inventory and it means team 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.550
 fortress-a all things just sold 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.600
 which were meanwhile loading us 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.620
 we are looking here 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.620
 team fortress toy so full screen 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.840
 so so so so 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.530
 here it is running 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.660
 so here we see 10 things things 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:07.170
 you can not resell 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.680
 sell everything so here it means 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:19.680
 press the button like this and press start 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:22.440
 we have all the achivki now 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:29.000
 it means you can even enter the game 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:33.420
 we see the team fortress 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.080
 add 94 things imagine 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.610
 imagine how much more then this 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:44.399
 it seems that not even everything is waiting here 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:47.580
 now it works and I also had 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.590
 some kind of myth means that if you get 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.979
 Achivki on these games here then 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.979
 things will be added for team fortress-a 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:02:00.319
 let's mean the toy is called wow 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.319
 wow woo so looking back 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:18.210
 so meiko, here it is, we open it ago, but by 176 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:20.640
 Achivok and yet on this game edge craft 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.890
 Kaida so not here 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.010
 the main thing is that when you receive from these 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.500
 achivki games did not work for you 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.890
 Steam is just banned 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:36.560
 account and then never return 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:42.720
 so the edge of the craft is called here it is 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:48.810
 edge edge kraft open get 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:56.550
 press al 146 achivok now you can 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:58.620
 just go into inventory and not on the go 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.850
 we don't add anything from these games 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:06.830
 let's see what kind of things 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.830
 all sorts of unique accessories 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.930
 limited use 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.410
 the page of the book was put once 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:21.620
 spells some kind of shorter many 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:25.390
 things as you see you can use 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.390
 only on Halloween and in full moon 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.580
 unique accessory 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.160
 all sorts of weapons tags are unique 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.680
 additional weapon medic can not be about 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.180
 can not be sold and can not be transferred not 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:46.390
 I know why we got these things, but 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:50.180
 who wants to farm here but something like this 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.850
 seems to be saying everything by the way 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.130
 you can get things by say that 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.670

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:01.100

 we don't get hacked so don't 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.060

 take and hack and all that stuff 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:17.690

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:45.020
 shorter than a lot of interesting clan these 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:49.990
