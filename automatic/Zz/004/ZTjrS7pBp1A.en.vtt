 Hello everyone. Welcome to the teaching film of CAYIN SMP-NEO series multimedia player. 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 This video will show you how to use the SMP player and the embedded software SMP-NEO to complete the login management interface and start the installation. 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:31.100
 After you receive the multimedia player, please open the product packaging. 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.200
 Then follow the 4 steps below to complete the hardware installation. 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.000
 There will be a multimedia player, a power transformer, and a power cord in the package. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.100
 You will also need to prepare an additional Ethernet route, a USB keyboard and mouse, a screen, and its mounting wires. 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.400
 Now let's start installing this player with the SMP-6000 as an example. 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.480
 step 1 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:10.560
 Connect the Ethernet route to the zone network port of this player. Under the default conditions, SMP will obtain the IP address from the DHCP server. 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.460
 Step 2 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:22.600
 Connect a VGA, DVI or HDMI cable to the screen. The default screen resolution is the built-in resolution of the screen. 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.640
 Step 3 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.400
 Connect the keyboard and mouse to any USB connector. 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.240
 Step 4 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.900
 SMP will start automatically when connected to the power supply. 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.500
 The above steps apply to all multimedia players. 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.980
 Please find the corresponding connector for each player. 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.800
 Once the login screen appears on the screen, the hardware installation is complete. 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.600
 Now you can enter the default username and password. 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.000
 The default username is "webadmin" and the password is "admin" 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.700
 Then select the language of the management interface, then click [Login]
