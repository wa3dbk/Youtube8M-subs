00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:08.410
 well today I will show you how to prepare 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:11.260
 the strains of the oat worms is very 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:15.240
 interesting because this will help us 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:18.560
 food for the first 10 days 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.560
 after the male comes out 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.560
 we need 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.130
 a donated strain of putting in the worms 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.900
 I do not know if they get to see 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.900
 it was like a slight dizziness 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.440
 that means that this action the 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.440
 we use 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:48.040
 in the walls 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:50.800
 we need the strain we need sand 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.630
 these are bought any dietary 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.310
 try to get this one that is pretty 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.130
 finite 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:00.420
 and milk 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:04.040
 in a container what I do is put it 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.800
 oatmeal and milk 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.450
 and mix everything until you get a 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.189
 creamy consistency 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.159
 because I have the creamy consistency 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:17.520
 I have the writings where I will put my 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.520
 know 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.700
 He passed 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.250
 not only are the two centimeters of 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.720
 material if they still do not have the 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.120
 consistency we can add a 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.200
 little milk and everything can be 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.200
 fix on the fly 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.219
 we will take 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.609
 but that is not submerged that is not 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:50.240
 does the truth about a 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:53.040
 thumb thumb width 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.060
 once we have this 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:00.070
 we take the strain 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.070
 and a small portion was made 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.860
 in that small portion 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.860
 to see hundreds of worms 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.290
 that they will be able to feed on the new 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.900
 oats 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.900
 once the crop is done 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.500
 we take a telematic stage we uncover 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.850
 and this we can catch it we can 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.880
 have somewhere that goes 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.520
 that yes more or less a week in 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.490
 a few weeks already we will realize 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.990
 that the top of the oats on the 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.320
 surface is going to have a whole strip 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:48.190
 white of the Cerritos that is extracted with 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.740
 a small brush and you can 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.350
 feed the young from day 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.710
 5 of born that is when we get to the 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.230
 male follows more or less until 2 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.790
 weeks are 2 weeks to take 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.860
 better the artery 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.860
 or we can give you something 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:14.840
 micro they used a white worm or some 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:17.569
 larvae or apnea but that's how they spent 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.610
 the little fish is going to have a better 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.980
 size to be able to receive the 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.349
 live food more 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.940
 of the good thing about this food is that it does not 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:29.760
 dirty the water 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.590
 but if or if he always has only 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.370
 the bugs do not have to throw the sand 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.120
 in the water, that is, wait for 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.120
 that the little bugs 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.090
 rise from the surface of the candle 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.480
 go up and there is removed with a pincelito 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.970
 it's going to clean up like that gets in all the 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:54.200
 present is stirred 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.350
 well this is my worms making 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.320
 of sand 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.200
 but it serves to him that like all the video of 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.599
 challenge Argentina be 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.650
 productive so that our goals that 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.650
 we rest and strong
