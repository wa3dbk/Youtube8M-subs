status 6 let's go to take this guy out
here<00:00:14.429> real<00:00:14.549> quick<00:00:17.210> and<00:00:18.210> what<00:00:18.330> I<00:00:18.359> did<00:00:18.600> not<00:00:18.720> go

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
here real quick and what I did not go

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.420 
here real quick and what I did not go
with<00:00:18.990> any<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.289> classified<00:00:19.650> border<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.220> EV

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
with any of the classified border the EV

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.070 
with any of the classified border the EV
or<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.699> rampage<00:00:21.060> board<00:00:21.359> just<00:00:21.539> because<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.960> me

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
or the rampage board just because to me

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.519 
or the rampage board just because to me
I<00:00:22.140> don't<00:00:22.289> think<00:00:22.350> it's<00:00:22.500> necessary<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:24.410> have<00:00:25.410> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
I don't think it's necessary I have the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.660 
I don't think it's necessary I have the
even<00:00:25.769> Jake<00:00:25.949> classified<00:00:26.430> as<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.670> guys<00:00:26.789> know<00:00:26.820> I

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
even Jake classified as you guys know I

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.800 
even Jake classified as you guys know I
honestly<00:00:29.670> didn't<00:00:30.060> notice<00:00:30.179> any<00:00:30.630> improvement

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
honestly didn't notice any improvement

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.310 
honestly didn't notice any improvement
or<00:00:31.500> over<00:00:32.099> any<00:00:32.309> other<00:00:33.110> motherboard<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.140> I've

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
or over any other motherboard that I've

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.220 
or over any other motherboard that I've
had<00:00:34.890> previously<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:36.090> that's<00:00:36.690> why<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.899> didn't<00:00:37.110> go

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
had previously so that's why I didn't go

alright so here's the board guys have

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.200 
alright so here's the board guys have
been<00:01:54.470> using<00:01:54.620> BBJ<00:01:55.250> boards<00:01:55.580> now<00:01:55.700> for<00:01:55.970> a<00:01:56.000> while

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
been using BBJ boards now for a while

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.900 
been using BBJ boards now for a while
and<00:01:56.510> I<00:01:56.660> loved<00:01:57.200> them<00:01:58.990> there<00:01:59.990> she<00:02:00.170> is<00:02:00.760> the<00:02:01.760> reason

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
why I chose this board it's all black

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.310 
why I chose this board it's all black
with<00:02:04.880> white<00:02:05.150> I<00:02:06.190> love<00:02:07.190> that<00:02:07.340> design<00:02:08.320> makes

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
bottom for overclocking alright guys

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.449 
bottom for overclocking alright guys
that's<00:02:22.880> pretty<00:02:23.120> much<00:02:23.240> it<00:02:24.070> stay<00:02:25.070> tuned<00:02:25.250> for<00:02:25.430> the

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
that's pretty much it stay tuned for the

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.860 
that's pretty much it stay tuned for the
next<00:02:25.610> unboxing<00:02:26.020> god<00:02:27.020> you're<00:02:27.230> you<00:02:27.410> signing<00:02:27.650> out
