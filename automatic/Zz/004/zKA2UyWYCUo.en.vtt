00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.180
 and there changed the association on the island 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.139
 today we will talk a little about 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.540
 hoses and soot mainly for 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.170
 start the hose 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.480
 to me it does not matter so much in the nague in the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.330
 issue of amount of smoke 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.630
 is what will import the amount of 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:28.010
 smoke is the obvious naviraian but 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.720
 especially the one you put 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.000
 what essence do you put and the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.430
 amount of coal you put in 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.800
 so when I look at the hose there is not 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.760
 I think about the amount of smoke 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.789
 but the main issue of the hose is 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.620
 whether it is washable or does not have the issue of 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.239
 flow and such but mostly to me 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.610
 can cry in the comments 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.399
 but mainly for me hose if 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.660
 are men's and washable or non-washable 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:01.430
 the rest is aesthetic beauty is this kind of 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.430
 thing for me can cry 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:10.619
 Let's try to open this hose here. 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.070
 and we will be able to see the 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.920
 soot that lies within it is not 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.720
 only the one you blow in the beginning and 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.329
 see that large amount so quit 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.360
 and yes inside it for you to see how it is 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:26.250
 the condition of a non-washable hose 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.280
 after a few months some years of 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.069
 use is impracticable to continue using this 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.140
 type of hose for a long time and 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:37.829
 many people continue to use this type of 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.920
 hose or a lot is because it is the person 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.659
 looks mainly here in the cigarette holder 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.810
 plug and see that it is still 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.030
 Perfect outside still very good 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.729
 problem inside and that's what matters 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.340
 inside it is filled with soot with 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.880
 sure I'll open here show 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.880
 you a little 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.550
 This is for those who think that just because 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.730
 gave that one blow and did not leave any more 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.290
 do not think the hose is clean 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:43.020
 this was not half the 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:45.740
 hose and this could be in the 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.740
 top handy right? 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.400
 the day is not in the lungs of many people 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.600
 This video was a really fast thing, I 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.989
 was old hose here I 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.390
 I decided to open it on to show you 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.850
 How harmful is it to you to continue using 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.560
 the hose was not washable and left 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.989
 rusting inside and then 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.380
 attacking soot into your 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.380
 lung 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:21.959
 imagine with that commitment was there goes 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:23.489
 It's cheap, it 's very cheap and it's been 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.600
 long does a hard plastic forever 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:30.840
 she then please do not continue 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.820
 using non-washable hoses for 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.630
 time 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:38.840
 It's this kind of thing that you 're 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.840
 smoking
