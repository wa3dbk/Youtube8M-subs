00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
so now what we're going to do is we're

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.740 
so now what we're going to do is we're
going<00:03:47.710> to<00:03:47.950> fold<00:03:48.310> this<00:03:48.640> right<00:03:48.910> corner<00:03:49.600> over

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
going to fold this right corner over

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.110 
going to fold this right corner over
here<00:03:49.930> in<00:03:50.440> a<00:03:50.500> little<00:03:51.130> bit<00:03:53.040> like<00:03:54.040> this<00:03:54.250> and<00:03:54.580> if<00:03:55.060> we

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
here in a little bit like this and if we

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.360 
here in a little bit like this and if we
turn<00:03:55.390> it<00:03:55.510> around<00:03:55.600> you<00:03:56.200> can<00:03:56.230> see<00:03:56.380> that<00:03:56.890> this<00:03:57.160> is

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
turn it around you can see that this is

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.090 
turn it around you can see that this is
where<00:03:57.580> the<00:03:58.030> turtles<00:03:58.420> body<00:03:58.660> is<00:03:58.959> going<00:03:59.260> to<00:03:59.410> be<00:03:59.560> so

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
where the turtles body is going to be so

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.230 
where the turtles body is going to be so
you<00:04:00.190> can<00:04:00.430> shape<00:04:00.700> it<00:04:00.910> however<00:04:01.540> much<00:04:02.410> you<00:04:02.590> want

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
you can shape it however much you want

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:09.560 
you can shape it however much you want
so<00:04:04.240> I'm<00:04:04.300> going<00:04:04.450> to<00:04:04.510> fold<00:04:04.690> the<00:04:04.840> left<00:04:05.080> side<00:04:05.290> in

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.060 

and<00:04:10.570> it<00:04:10.690> should<00:04:10.840> look<00:04:11.050> like<00:04:11.320> this

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
and it should look like this

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
and it should look like this
and<00:04:13.440> these<00:04:14.440> four<00:04:14.739> corners<00:04:15.070> over<00:04:15.459> here<00:04:15.880> are

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
and these four corners over here are

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.530 
and these four corners over here are
going<00:04:16.329> to<00:04:16.480> create<00:04:16.840> the<00:04:17.019> turtles<00:04:17.410> legs<00:04:17.859> so<00:04:18.760> what

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
going to create the turtles legs so what

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.970 
going to create the turtles legs so what
we're<00:04:19.660> going<00:04:19.780> to<00:04:19.870> do<00:04:20.049> here<00:04:20.320> is<00:04:20.500> we're<00:04:20.709> going<00:04:20.859> to

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
we're going to do here is we're going to

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.680 
we're going to do here is we're going to
fold<00:04:21.370> it<00:04:22.120> at<00:04:22.360> an<00:04:22.540> angle<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:23.440> you<00:04:24.300> can<00:04:25.300> fold<00:04:25.510> it

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
fold it at an angle and you can fold it

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.680 
fold it at an angle and you can fold it
however<00:04:26.320> much<00:04:26.710> you<00:04:26.950> want<00:04:26.980> or<00:04:27.460> how<00:04:27.730> little<00:04:28.060> how

on<00:04:36.100> the<00:04:36.580> left<00:04:36.790> side<00:04:37.000> and<00:04:37.330> I<00:04:37.840> like<00:04:38.050> to<00:04:38.169> turn<00:04:38.380> it

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
on the left side and I like to turn it

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.350 
on the left side and I like to turn it
over<00:04:38.650> to<00:04:39.040> see<00:04:39.250> how<00:04:39.430> it<00:04:39.610> looks<00:04:39.820> like<00:04:40.030> from<00:04:40.090> the

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
over to see how it looks like from the

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.590 
over to see how it looks like from the
front<00:04:40.800> so<00:04:41.800> I<00:04:41.860> can<00:04:42.130> shape<00:04:42.430> the<00:04:42.669> legs<00:04:42.880> the<00:04:43.480> way

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
front so I can shape the legs the way

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.420 
front so I can shape the legs the way
that<00:04:43.780> I<00:04:43.810> want<00:04:44.110> them<00:04:44.290> to<00:04:45.750> like<00:04:46.750> that<00:04:47.280> turn<00:04:48.280> it

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
over again and repeat the same thing

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.500 
over again and repeat the same thing
with<00:04:51.280> the<00:04:51.490> remaining<00:04:52.210> two<00:04:52.810> flaps<00:04:54.240> so<00:04:55.240> again

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
with the remaining two flaps so again

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.300 
with the remaining two flaps so again
I'll<00:04:55.690> turn<00:04:55.870> it<00:04:56.050> over<00:04:56.140> to<00:04:56.500> see<00:04:56.740> how<00:04:56.979> it<00:04:57.130> looks

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
I'll turn it over to see how it looks

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.300 
I'll turn it over to see how it looks
like<00:04:57.400> from<00:04:57.700> the<00:04:57.850> front<00:04:57.880> and<00:04:59.100> then<00:05:00.100> turn<00:05:00.280> it

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
like from the front and then turn it

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.480 
like from the front and then turn it
back<00:05:00.460> over<00:05:00.990> before<00:05:01.990> folding<00:05:02.650> this<00:05:02.860> final<00:05:03.280> flap

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
back over before folding this final flap

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.970 
back over before folding this final flap
over<00:05:03.700> here

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:13.980 

there<00:05:08.980> you<00:05:09.070> go<00:05:11.880> now<00:05:12.880> you<00:05:12.940> can<00:05:13.240> leave<00:05:13.510> the<00:05:13.720> leg

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
there you go now you can leave the leg

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.050 
there you go now you can leave the leg
sort<00:05:14.500> of<00:05:14.620> a<00:05:15.600> diamond<00:05:16.600> shape<00:05:16.930> like<00:05:17.470> that<00:05:17.770> or<00:05:18.550> you

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
sort of a diamond shape like that or you

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.000 
sort of a diamond shape like that or you
can<00:05:19.240> add<00:05:19.450> a<00:05:19.480> little<00:05:19.720> bit<00:05:19.870> of<00:05:20.010> ornamentation

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
can add a little bit of ornamentation

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.730 
can add a little bit of ornamentation
and<00:05:21.840> fold<00:05:22.840> it<00:05:22.990> back<00:05:23.020> a<00:05:23.230> little<00:05:23.410> bit<00:05:23.790> like<00:05:24.790> this

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
and fold it back a little bit like this

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.110 
and fold it back a little bit like this
so<00:05:26.740> that<00:05:26.890> from<00:05:26.980> the<00:05:27.160> front<00:05:27.400> it<00:05:27.700> looks<00:05:27.730> like

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
so that from the front it looks like

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.780 
so that from the front it looks like
that

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
that

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.760 
that
but<00:05:30.790> it<00:05:31.120> really<00:05:31.270> doesn't<00:05:31.570> make<00:05:31.870> too<00:05:32.290> much<00:05:32.320> of<00:05:32.500> a

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
but it really doesn't make too much of a

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.290 
but it really doesn't make too much of a
difference<00:05:35.250> and<00:05:36.250> you'll<00:05:36.580> repeat<00:05:36.880> the<00:05:37.090> same

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
difference and you'll repeat the same

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:44.460 
difference and you'll repeat the same
thing<00:05:37.600> with<00:05:37.810> the<00:05:37.930> remaining<00:05:39.090> two<00:05:40.090> legs<00:05:40.390> so<00:05:43.470> now

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
thing with the remaining two legs so now

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.510 
thing with the remaining two legs so now
my<00:05:44.710> turtle<00:05:45.040> looks<00:05:45.390> like<00:05:46.390> this<00:05:47.160> now<00:05:48.160> to<00:05:48.220> make

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
my turtle looks like this now to make

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.670 
my turtle looks like this now to make
the<00:05:48.670> head<00:05:48.850> we're<00:05:49.150> going<00:05:49.330> to<00:05:49.480> do<00:05:49.600> a<00:05:49.630> zigzag<00:05:50.080> fold

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
the head we're going to do a zigzag fold

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.600 
the head we're going to do a zigzag fold
on<00:05:50.950> the<00:05:51.190> top<00:05:51.720> corner<00:05:52.720> over<00:05:52.990> here<00:05:53.110> and<00:05:53.620> what<00:05:54.490> I'm

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
on the top corner over here and what I'm

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.870 
on the top corner over here and what I'm
going<00:05:54.820> to<00:05:54.910> do<00:05:55.120> is<00:05:55.300> I'm<00:05:55.480> going<00:05:55.690> to<00:05:55.810> fold<00:05:56.110> it<00:05:56.290> back

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
going to do is I'm going to fold it back

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:02.220 
going to do is I'm going to fold it back
and<00:05:58.290> notice<00:05:59.290> how<00:05:59.440> this<00:05:59.650> aligns<00:06:00.220> nicely<00:06:01.230> right

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:02.230 
and notice how this aligns nicely right

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.370 
and notice how this aligns nicely right
below<00:06:02.590> the<00:06:02.740> word<00:06:02.920> States<00:06:03.370> and<00:06:04.020> after<00:06:05.020> I<00:06:05.050> fold

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
below the word States and after I fold

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.710 
below the word States and after I fold
it<00:06:05.500> back<00:06:05.680> I'm<00:06:06.130> going<00:06:06.400> to<00:06:06.550> fold<00:06:07.000> a<00:06:07.330> little

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
it back I'm going to fold a little

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:15.520 
it back I'm going to fold a little
portion<00:06:08.380> of<00:06:08.530> it<00:06:08.940> back<00:06:10.620> this<00:06:11.620> way

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.260 

and<00:06:16.530> then<00:06:16.919> when<00:06:17.009> I<00:06:17.039> turn<00:06:17.310> it<00:06:17.340> around<00:06:17.550> you<00:06:18.210> can

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
and then when I turn it around you can
