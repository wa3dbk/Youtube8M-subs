00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.349
 Hello everyone 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.240
 go today small presentation 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.330
 of a tractor then it is unique 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.160
 do not look for it anywhere it was a 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.160
 tractor that was realized so it's a 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.640
 tractor were able to simply lift 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.050
 realized by edwin it's the opposite 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.400
 so you may know this 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.489
 brand is an American brand 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.749
 so that's when I read you the unique 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.059
 to say that he is unique in farming 

00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:38.309
 simulator just a little bit matter 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.999
 the models you are looking for there is no 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.760
 nowhere 

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:43.949
 so I'm going to show it to you because 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.560
 frankly bravo he did a job 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.970
 huge on it 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.340
 I can tell you that he spent a little 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.900
 moment so this is his first mode so 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.120
 first of all, you still have to 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.820
 to be correct with him 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.620
 it's not necessarily obvious me 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.719
 find it's for a first mode 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.089
 it's great that's just it's 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.950
 great so I'll show you the 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.720
 So that's a beautiful beast 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.420
 two months ago but I show it to you 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.950
 in October and in normal like that you 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.470
 see me the frozen webshop is 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.000
 me who realized him and hate because 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.190
 that hey he is not law cat so me 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.619
 I did him so he is where a shock 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.100
 So here I am, I show it to you 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.880
 so it's pretty well done you 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.880
 go see there are still some 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.520
 options on it anyway so the tank 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.750
 it's piece by piece a game I specify 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.820
 there are a lot of things that have been 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.830
 made by him piece by piece as 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.330
 the stairs all that stairs 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.759
 it's custom-made that is to say that 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.890
 it's not worth looking for 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.399
 that's really it's really 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.870
 unique 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.310
 its mode 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.850
 So therefore that's the same time you 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.510
 see when it's completely hall 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.580
 this is me personally I find 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.590
 that it is a mode that is rather nice 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.630
 especially for a brand like the map 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.270
 Californian as he is very tall 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.400
 field to and we will go up in 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.910
 go we go then we go backwards is a 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.910
 little buddy 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.550
 and we will look a little closer so 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.490
 stairs so 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.030
 super nickel aspect so we will do the 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.569
 lighthouses so it works 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.569
 here 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.400
 here 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.920
 here is the giro who works very well 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.350
 also then on there are a lot of 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.400
 things look at the details and the 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.100
 details of the pipes and all that 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.280
 frankly it's great it's great 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.290
 frankly I love that a vote that 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.300
 I risk playing career because 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.480
 frankly I find it really very 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.510
 very well done very well finished we see at 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.730
 level of texture it's clean 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.930
 well it's working well a very beautiful 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.060
 fashion that made us stop the dwarf 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.530
 frankly so for his first I the 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.739
 redis but it's true that I am 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.600
 maybe a little boring on it but 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.510
 that's good it's fine so we're going to 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:10.510
 see inside missed giro so 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.819
 the interior good interior is simple 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.140
 this is ronald fenty running or 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.510
 had recognized to them that gestique de 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:20.290
 lucent 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:24.569
 that's it, if I'm wrong, we can 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.569
 open the doors on time by against 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:31.829
 so this is to open the door 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.129
 we would see this is great 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.019
 worked the door system and to 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.019
 the rear 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.019
 here 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.120
 so if we look from the outside then 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.230
 the dry I will show you after me I 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.900
 find it's really going the system of the 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.799
 door super well done 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:55.010
 nothing to say then you have camera 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:59.310
 inside and a camera at the back 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:04.470
 so who is rather nice frankly 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:06.329
 well, well, well, then we're going to 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.060

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.220

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.930

 see the character well so you see 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.280
 a character animation to 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.289
 inside and no problem the 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.850
