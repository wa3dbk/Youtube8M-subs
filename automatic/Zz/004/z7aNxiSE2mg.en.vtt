00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.530
 more to the kitchen program that follows 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.350
 I missed today what we are going to do 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.879
 is going to be a oneapp mushrooms in tribute to 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.250
 our favorite plumber who also 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:18.380
 premieres videogame and for that we are going to 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.119
 give it a salty cupcake shape and you'll say 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.039
 to salty cupcakes how do you do that 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.720
 there are two ways first you take a 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.880
 normal cupcake the revo thies in salt 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.320
 which can be quite unpleasant or 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.320
 the other one that is how we are going to do now 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.480
 the ingredients for the recipe today 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.640
 They are 500 grams of flour 3 tablespoons 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.800

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:05.329
 mushrooms inside mushrooms 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.329
 we started with the dough 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.380
 let's start mixing the flour 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.140
 the yeast the oil 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.700
 and a little water 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:32.470
 well once you have fought with the 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:35.380
 mass that you see is fine if you follow it 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.660
 hitting becomes smaller if not 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.050
 we are interested, no no no, that Jasmine and 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.110
 muffins no 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.860
 once you have the dough done and well 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.970
 made 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.880
 it stops resting for a while 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.000
 and me too 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.549
 well while we let the dough rest and 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.830
 am and we do the filling we were not going to 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.640
 rest 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.640
 Yes better 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.250
 to fill in really you can enter what 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.890
 I want to do what I 'm going to do 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.640
 it's going to be the next thing I'm going to catch 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.530
 mushrooms cut into pieces 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.000
 kids little kids kids and you 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.680
 I'm going to cut another Chinese ximÃ©nez that 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.430
 contains little kids and what 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.430
 I'm going to sautÃ© everything 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.280
 Now let's make some little circles 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.280
 mount the there we want it in the 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.280
 next we take a glass of shot and 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.390
 cutter 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.490
 well once the filling is done what 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.470
 let's do it is the following we take 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.870
 the size of a tennis ball more or 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.849
 less 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.849
 we do it round and plan it 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.730
 once flattened what you do is you put 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.730
 stuffed salami 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.620
 the two have left the cheese 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.920
 and salary 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.920
 and then you close it 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.900
 look at a zeta 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.270
 seriously once the cupcakes are made 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.030
 what we are going to do is going to be the 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.980
 place upside down so that the part 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.440
 above 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.200
 we put them in the mold 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.569
 well fitted 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.489
 and you just have to let it 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.489
 Bake at 220 degrees 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.730
 and once you put them in the oven 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.349
 about 20 minutes hey I have not seen how 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.420
 they put the other two how fast you are not 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:07.520
 is that it is the new option of the super 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:11.300
 mario world the wild 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.340
 the four players there is a child who 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.160
 look public without being paid only 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.290
 we had to be ready to go to 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.360
 put out the flowers of fire that crops 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.360
 there is weekly strip 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.760
 and now you will ask and the pesto and the 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.550
 cheese cubes for cheese you'll see 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:37.050
 what you do with the text is you take with 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.050
 a brush or with a spoon 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.370
 you count everything green 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.050
 and now you put the little circles that 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.610
 it's on top like it's a mushroom 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.719
 true 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.719
 true pinochet 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.940
 and to finish you give a touch of heat 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:03.210
 so that the cheese is melted and this is 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.780
